We moved in together one week before we got married. Before getting married, I always felt disgusted when I would visit him because his house always had dog hair everywhere. Whenever I left, I would find dog hair on my clothes, in my shoes etc... and that really annoyed me. So when we moved in together, I made it clear to my husband that I wouldn't want a dirty house, and I refuse to clean after his dog. At the time, he agreed he would clean the floors and be the one to clean after the dog. \n\nA year ago, we had our first baby boy. I am very protective over my son. As a mother, I want to make sure he is safe and has a clean home where he can play freely. Previously, when the dog has encountered babies or kids, he is always very anxious, nervous, and protective of my husband. With our baby, his behaviour is worse. Now that our baby is walking and running around the house, the dog can not find a safe space and is anxious the entire time baby is awake and walking. This past month, the dog has growled at baby when baby was walking towards him and on a different occasion the dog went in to bite baby when the baby caught him off guard and got close enough to touch him. Not to mention how jealous the dog gets anytime my husband is playing with baby. My husband was there for both of these incidents and denies them as being anything serious or of concern... I felt the opposite. \n\nThis past year has been the hardest year of my life as a first time mom. Not only do I not find a moment in the day to have a moment for myself, I definitely do not want to spend any free time I have cleaning after the dog, my husband, or baby. There is dog hair everywhere, the floors are always dirty with dirt, mud, dog drool, dog hair...etc. the carpet has a layer of dog hair on it. I find dog hair in all my clothes, my food, my cups, in my butt crack. I am so disgusted and annoyed at this point and it takes too much of my mental and physical energy to keep up. I am so unhappy. \n\nFor the past few months I've just given up. My husband has noticed and he's picking up after me. He's been cleaning the house (but not the floors) and cooking occasionally. He's doing the best he can because he sees I'm frustrated... but still it's not enough. I am really grateful for my husband and tell him that everyday. But I want the dog out of here.

But I can hear your frustration and I think it's completely valid. Your husband seems to be oblivious to a potential threat to the baby's safety (dog aggression) AND is also not upholding his agreement to clean the floors. You're carrying a lot of mental load. I agree with others who suggested that your husband should agree to hiring a cleaning service if he isn't willing or able to consistently help with this. Is it possible for you to put the pup in doggy daycare to give you a bit of a breather during the week? I would recommend having the dog in a separate location in the house if he has shown aggression towards the baby, and hiring a trainer/behaviorist may be a good idea. \n\nAlso, it's crazy to me that people are glossing over the part where the dog was aggressive towards your baby.

Makes me doubt you a bit about the aggression, feels like you're looking for an excuse to get rid of the dog because of the hair.

You would be TA if this were just about dog hair, but growling at your baby is concerning behaviour.\n\nYou might want to try meeting your husband halfway, though. Can you ask that the dog work with a behaviourist, perhaps while temporarily living elsewhere for the safety of your baby?\n\nDo try to be sensitive to the fact that you're asking him to give up a pet with whom he has, I imagine, a deep emotional bond. He would likely feel deep grief.\n\nAs a separate issue, it sounds like you are really exhausted and struggling emotionally right now. You state that you have \"given up,\" which is quite concerning.

Please consider speaking a professional, as this shouldn\u2019t feel so overwhelming.\n\nThe fact that yourself and husband disagree on the dogs behaviour suggests that we don\u2019t have the whole story - it could be that he is too relaxed or that you are too on edge.

You are a wonderful mother for protecting him. \n\nThat said - your husband came with the dog. You knew that when you got married.

You're using the baby as an excuse. \"Get rid of the dog\" is not an appropriate response to your husband's pet, which I'm sure he loves. The dog can be locked away from the child.\n\nYour husband, however, is minimising his dog's behaviour. It *is* concerning that the dog growls at a child.\n\nYou two need to talk. Tell your husband that the dog needs to be evaluated at the very least. Taken to a dog behaviourist who will be able to evaluate the dog for it's current behaviour and trainability. If the behaviourist decides the dog needs training, he needs to commit to the training for the safety of your child. If the behaviourist says the dog will never be safe around your child he needs to understand that *is* an ultimatum. If he refuses to have to dog assessed you both need to consider why that is. If he is afraid they'll tell you to get rid of the dog, then he recognises there's something wrong and has decided to ignore it. If he thinks there is genuinely nothing wrong then his judgement and should not be trusted alone with your child and the dog.", "I\u2019ll never understand couples who move in just before/after the wedding. It\u2019s like you want the marriage to be stressful from the go.", "I am going to probably be a different from many responses here and say ESH...\n\n1) I do agree with the assessment of others that the dog issue should have been taken care of ahead of marriage and having a kid. At the very least, there needed to be better communication about how much it all bothered you. That way, you could have backed out OR additional conversations and compromises could be reached. My husband had a dog (who I also considered my dog) when he lived alone, and I did end up cleaning up after it a lot. I was willing to do that, but if I hadn't been, I would have made my husband do it.  In this case, it doesn't sound like you consider the dog part of the family like I did, so the cleaning and upkeep issue one is a bigger one in your relationship. \n\n2) I also think your husband sucks here for being in denial about the dog. The dog is a ticking time bomb, and you are going to regret it if you don't take care of this IMMEDIATELY.  Dog trainers are something you can look into, but they aren't magical, so if that doesn't work, you may need to rehome the dog for the safety of the baby.  Not all dogs are compatible with small kids. Source: Traumatic personal experience involving the dog we both loved from point #1", "NTA. Kid takes priority over dog.

You asked your partner to clean up after the dog (and clean the floors) when you moved in together.

From your description of past behavior, this dog is not comfortable around kids.  And maybe training would help; but if your husband doesn't see the problem, is he going to put in the work to train the dog?  From your follow-up comments, that seems very unlikely.\n\nSo if your husband won't clean up after this dog (as he previously agreed to) and he won't put in the time or money to train it to not harm your child, you don't really have any other choices.  It's time to rehome this dog.", "Leave it to reddit to be completely unreasonable and defensive when they hear \"dog\"", "NTA.

It is a bit misleading how you worded it, because you made it seem like the growling is as bad as the hairs and your dislike of dogs, but a growling dog is just an accident waiting to happen. Even if you're always present when dog and baby are in the same room, you cannot always see it coming and definitely cannot prevent it.

Same here\n\nIt honestly sounds like neither you OR husband have enough experience with dogs and that this stuff is like...not basic knowledge.  Both of you need to level up your education in dog owning. Reach out to your local vet for good resources. Yes, even a big adult dog can go to puppy classes.  Most dogs are actually \\*happier\\* when they are trained well, because they are part of the pack. Right now, your dog does not know.  \n\nIt also sounds like you need a professional cleaning service, if only to reset a starting point.  And a groomer.", "Yes. You are. \n\nYou knew this dude has a family member, it came before you. You don't like the family member so you decided it's in your right to break that family to make room for you. Cuz for some reason you're more important than the family member who was already there. That's selfishness. And you not even seeing that is entitlement. \n\nYou should've just dated someone who has no pets and learned not to leave your baby around to catch an antsy dog off guard before you decided to become a mother.", "YTA. \n\nyou sound like a real blast to be around. /s", "NTA - baby\u2019s safety is number one priority.

If I lived with a dog that was showing aggression towards my baby it would be gone. I would guess that not many people on this thread have dealt with a fear aggressive dog. It isn\u2019t easy. It sounds like this dog has had some longstanding behavioral issues-OP\u2019s brother in law couldn\u2019t keep the dog because of how it interacted with his partner. Keeping an active toddler and a dog separated 24/7 is extremely difficult and stressful. Do you keep the dog constantly confined to one room or force it to live outside? Some have suggested that you might be overreacting. Here\u2019s a way to establish if that is true or not. You and hubby need to get an appointment with an animal behaviorist. These are veterinarians who have done additional training in animal behavior. If the behaviorist says the dog is a danger to your baby/should not be in a house with children, etc, then the dog needs to go. Behaviorists can also prescribe medication and recommend specific trainers and training methods. However, progress may take months or even years. Unfortunately, behaviorists are rare and most have extended wait times for appointments. See if your husband will agree to this if you both agree to abide by the behaviorist\u2019s recommendations. I would also film any concerning interactions between the dog and the baby. A trainer or behaviorist might be able to give you some insight. The hair issue should be a lot easier to fix.

And yeah, some people will come in here saying that it's not the same thing, that it's just a dog, but it absolutely is - the dog is a member of the family, and it is a living thing that is loved.    \n\nAs for the anxiety and growling, this is all pretty normal behaviour for a dog.  Dogs can't speak.  They communicate with body language and vocalizations like growling.  It is on you to teach baby to read the signs, and how to properly approach dogs - even at a year old, you can reinforce this.  \n\nAs well, your own anxiety is feeding into the dog's.  The dog has, by now, no doubt integrated you into the family, and thus feeds off your mental state.  If you tense up and worry every time the baby is anywhere near the dog, the dog will see that as a reason to tense up and worry around the baby.

That shit is reckless parenting. I dont care if the dog is your husbands responsibility, you let a baby crawl near a sneering dog. What if it bit your kid? That could kill/seriously hurt the baby, or it could force you to have to put the dog down. You should never let babies go near even calm tempered dogs, since babies have no clue how to interact with them and a dog can get irritated if the baby annoys it. \n\nWhen your kid is old enough you have to teach him to not prod/pull at the dog and to not go near its personal space.

We moved in together one week before we got married. Before getting married, I always felt disgusted when I would visit him because his house always had dog hair everywhere. Whenever I left, I would find dog hair on my clothes, in my shoes etc... and that really annoyed me. So when we moved in together, I made it clear to my husband that I wouldn't want a dirty house, and I refuse to clean after his dog. At the time, he agreed he would clean the floors and be the one to clean after the dog. \n\nA year ago, we had our first baby boy. I am very protective over my son. As a mother, I want to make sure he is safe and has a clean home where he can play freely. Previously, when the dog has encountered babies or kids, he is always very anxious, nervous, and protective of my husband. With our baby, his behaviour is worse. Now that our baby is walking and running around the house, the dog can not find a safe space and is anxious the entire time baby is awake and walking. This past month, the dog has growled at baby when baby was walking towards him and on a different occasion the dog went in to bite baby when the baby caught him off guard and got close enough to touch him. Not to mention how jealous the dog gets anytime my husband is playing with baby. My husband was there for both of these incidents and denies them as being anything serious or of concern... I felt the opposite. \n\nThis past year has been the hardest year of my life as a first time mom. Not only do I not find a moment in the day to have a moment for myself, I definitely do not want to spend any free time I have cleaning after the dog, my husband, or baby. There is dog hair everywhere, the floors are always dirty with dirt, mud, dog drool, dog hair...etc. the carpet has a layer of dog hair on it. I find dog hair in all my clothes, my food, my cups, in my butt crack. I am so disgusted and annoyed at this point and it takes too much of my mental and physical energy to keep up. I am so unhappy. \n\nFor the past few months I've just given up. My husband has noticed and he's picking up after me. He's been cleaning the house (but not the floors) and cooking occasionally. He's doing the best he can because he sees I'm frustrated... but still it's not enough. I am really grateful for my husband and tell him that everyday. But I want the dog out of here. Am I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "ESH\n\nEveryone else has explained why you\u2019re the asshole, but your husbands flippant reaction to the dog growling and almost biting the kid is also a problem here. Jealousy in animals can turn dangerous, especially when it\u2019s toward a kid. You should contact a behaviourist/dog trainer/dog psychologist to help you try and make it work between the dog and the kid.", "NAH. My unsolicited advice is 1) Get any carpet in the house replaced with vinyl flooring 2) Get one of the robot vacuums, they make mopping ones too. Set them to run two or three times a week. 3) Baby gates. Keep the dog and baby separated until the dog is trained and the baby is old enough to be taught not to \u201csurprise\u201d the dog. 4) Get the dog groomed professionally there should not be hair in your food and butt crack, although the image made me lol.\n\nThis is fixable. Will take money and work but it\u2019s all fixable. Good luck.", "INFO: have you consulted a trainer or a behaviorist?", "YTA you married him and you knew he has a dog.

If he sees the dog blatantly acting jealous, possessive and what not it should be common sense that he needs to step up and help OP take charge, not just continue to sit around and wait for others to do all the work pertaining to *his* dog and the household. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s in the wrong for wanting to keep it but he also shouldn\u2019t have to wait to always be asked about these things.", "They\u2019d an also look into training for the dog and something for the anxiety the dog. feels. I definitely agree that the lack of communication here is a huge issue.", "Correction, they need a certified behaviorist, dog is anxious and showing guarding tendencies around the husband. IF, and that\u2019s a big if, OP\u2019s husband is willing to fully commit to managing and changing the dog\u2019s behavior, rehoming may not be required. But OP, this means your husband needs to actively acknowledge that the dog is a threat to the baby\u2019s safety right now and he needs to step up and take the lead on this. \n\nYes dogs are family, but you wouldn\u2019t let family shit on the floor or try to bite your baby. He needs to decide fast if he\u2019s going to put the human beings in his life above being lazy with caring for the dog.\n\nETA gentle ESH, you\u2019ve gotta communicate this. I know you\u2019re overwhelmed but shutting down isn\u2019t going to get you closer to a fix here. If you\u2019re worried about him not taking your concerns seriously, set up a consultation with a behaviorist.

You still knew he had a dog.", "You didn\u2019t answer anything", "this seems like a valid answer to me", "ok your husband definitely the asshole as well.", "Out of curiosity, what breed/type of dog is it. I love dogs, just other peoples dogs, personally prefer to live with cats. Much easier and less possessive as a whole.", "You act like the baby is just her kids and not his responsibility too. How did she get pregnant , divine intervention? People should get rid of pets that are a threat to their kids safety.", "OP replied in another comment that they had already been dating a year when her now-husband agreed to rehome his brother\u2019s dog, which was showing signs of anxiety and jealousy towards brother\u2019s gf. She also clarified that she didn\u2019t hate dogs before living with one that growled at her child.", "This is not acceptable. Is there somewhere else you can stay for a bit? I think you need a safe, clean environment for yourself and your son. After you are out of this negative environment, then you should making further decisions. I personally agree with you that the dog needs to be rehomed but I'm sure people will shriek at me for saying it. Your husband refuses to train the dog, isn't cleaning up properly, etc...", "You sound absolutely obsessed, who on earth cleans a floor on their knees with a paper towel? I have a dog that sheds a lot and you absolutely do not need to paper towel the floor.", "I mean you sound somewhat obsessed about the hair thing\u2026 I guess you do you but that is something you should have considered before moving in with him.\nI get your feelings 100% but than you are just not made to live with a dog person\n\nit seems like you really just are at a point where both of you need to make compromises and ultimately decide if thats ok for you or not.\n\nId say NTA but neither is your husband. you are just two different people and its up to you both to find a compromise for the sake of the child you brought into this world.", "I liked dogs too until I lived with one.", "I\u2019m sorry, but your husband sounds like the root of all the dog problems. He isn\u2019t even doing the bare minimum to clean or train. He\u2019s doing the dog (and you and the baby) a disservice.", "You knew about the dog before you married him. You knew about your husband and who he is as a person \\[if he takes care of things and his dog\\] before you married him too. It's not the dogs fault that your husband doesn't care enough. \n\nAnd also you said  *definitely do not want to spend any free time I have cleaning after the dog, my husband, or baby.* So your reply now with that are two different things. You can't take care of the baby whenever you want to unfortunately.", "Take the baby and leave. The child support will be enough to escape with.", "You're actually going with \"he started it\" against a dog you resent? Really?\n\nThat dog is a better person than you, more mature, more emotionally developed. Less crazy.\nYou're forcing a situation where you get your way.\nI can see you endangering your child by winding the dog up till he snaps or poisoning him.", "Jesus, looking at your other comments, you're absolute trash.\nI really hope your husband fucks off with the baby, dog and nanny which from how crazy, jealous and obsessive you are, looks likely.", "Bro you really want to write your own narrative here. Its painfully obvious. You need to listen to people and understand this world existed, and will continue to exist, without you.\n\nEdit: You have a fucking nanny too?! Holy shit move your ass.", "Well for the child's sake I hope the father doesn't learn the consequences after the dog bites the child in the face.", "They have the capacity to learn. And they do, if the parents are consistent. I did it with my child and two shepherd dogs. My child is now 5 and knows the commands for the dogs in both English and Dutch (tbf, they're not dissimilar), helps take care of the dogs (feeding, brushing, sweeping, walking), and they dogs are completely enamored with her.   \n\n\nAll of this took time and patience, and the dedication of both my partner and I. And lots of redirection of the kiddo when kiddo started crawling and walking.", "A 1 yr old absolutely can learn to be gentle. They won't get it right every time, but it is not too early to start training the child", "They absolution do... not perfectly, but they are great learners.", "they do. they also have the capacity to learn sign language and communicate so stop pulling BS out of your keister that you don't actually know", "A dog showing aggression to a baby is not ok. The baby's welfare comes first here.", "And regardless,  dog showing aggression to a baby needs to go. Most behaviourists would be tell the parents that. This is not safe.", "Exactly, so why did she move in with him in the first place", "I've literally done that a few times now. If you try it, you might find those thinner hairs that the broom and mop don't pick up. \n\nOkay...omg maybe I'm obsessed.", "I agree.", "I feel like life will be harder if I leave. The dog is the issue all around, the dog can leave instead of breaking up a family.", "Oh, definitely. And he seems pretty oblivious even now to the danger to his child; if I was OP, I\u2019d take the child and go.", "Children can learn, however, not the complexities of dog behavior at 1. Your situation is entirely different as you train your dogs, OPs husband obviously does not. The husband also seems to have no problem with this incredibly volatile social anxiety the dog has, turning a blind eye to it. It also seems like you trained your dogs from an early age. My grandparents train dogs for a living and it is incredibly hard to retrain dogs after their adolescence, especially so with one's who display this type of nervous aggression/person territorial-protection.\n\nAlso, the husband broke his promise of tending after the dog as diligently as he said, which makes me wonder how floppy he is about other things.", "That is true, young children can be taught...however it's not a good idea to teach with an already anxious animal.  That just seems to be asking for trouble.", "Why not use a vacuum?", "I read some of your replies and its a strong NTA for me  now. \n\nyou did a terrible job describing your situation in the OG post tbh. I would repost it with more information added like the fact about your husbands brother abandoning the dog before! \nthis makes a huge difference!!!\n\none last suggestion: maybe try and offer your husband a dog that you both pick and train together - one that doesnt shed a lot of hair and isnt super dirty all the time. if you can actually live with a dog that is", "I do agree with you. Whatever happens just remember the babies comfort and safety is #1. Good luck.", "Sure, my situation is different. I was responding to your scoff at 1 yos not being able to learn to be considerate around the dogs.   \n\n\nI do not agree with your statement that retraining adolescent dogs is difficult. I will posit that retraining THIS PARTICULAR adolescent dog is nigh impossible in this particular situation, given that hubs gives absolutely zero shits about training the dog, full stop.   \n\n\nAnd I'm not disagreeing that the hubs needs to step it up and adhere to the promise he made, I 100% agree that he's the AH in this situation for that alone.", "Our kiddos knew dog crates were off limits. From as soon as they could walk or get near them. It\u2019s actually not that hard. Just requires two parents to redirect \n\nAgree that the dog itself is harder.", "Dogs are unpredictable. Babies are unpredictable. Add dog anxiety/fear to the mix and the results can be catastrophic. No amount of \"training\" the baby can adequately mitigate the risk of a dog with aggressive tendencies where a split second could prove fatal.", "Yeah there are stories in the news all the time about dogs severely injuring or even killing children.  If the dog is showing any aggression towards the child at all it needs to go. NTA OP."]}
