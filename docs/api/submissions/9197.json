We moved in together one week before we got married. Before getting married, I always felt disgusted when I would visit him because his house always had dog hair everywhere. Whenever I left, I would find dog hair on my clothes, in my shoes etc... and that really annoyed me. So when we moved in together, I made it clear to my husband that I wouldn't want a dirty house, and I refuse to clean after his dog. At the time, he agreed he would clean the floors and be the one to clean after the dog. \n\nA year ago, we had our first baby boy. I am very protective over my son. As a mother, I want to make sure he is safe and has a clean home where he can play freely. Previously, when the dog has encountered babies or kids, he is always very anxious, nervous, and protective of my husband. With our baby, his behaviour is worse. Now that our baby is walking and running around the house, the dog can not find a safe space and is anxious the entire time baby is awake and walking. This past month, the dog has growled at baby when baby was walking towards him and on a different occasion the dog went in to bite baby when the baby caught him off guard and got close enough to touch him. Not to mention how jealous the dog gets anytime my husband is playing with baby. My husband was there for both of these incidents and denies them as being anything serious or of concern... I felt the opposite. \n\nThis past year has been the hardest year of my life as a first time mom. Not only do I not find a moment in the day to have a moment for myself, I definitely do not want to spend any free time I have cleaning after the dog, my husband, or baby. There is dog hair everywhere, the floors are always dirty with dirt, mud, dog drool, dog hair...etc. the carpet has a layer of dog hair on it. I find dog hair in all my clothes, my food, my cups, in my butt crack. I am so disgusted and annoyed at this point and it takes too much of my mental and physical energy to keep up. I am so unhappy. \n\nFor the past few months I've just given up. My husband has noticed and he's picking up after me. He's been cleaning the house (but not the floors) and cooking occasionally. He's doing the best he can because he sees I'm frustrated... but still it's not enough. I am really grateful for my husband and tell him that everyday. But I want the dog out of here. Am I the Asshole?\n\n\nEDIT: I clean our home regularly. Our home is not a dump. Currently, any free time I have away from baby is to cook or clean. \n\nThe dog was not there before me. My husband's brother abandoned the dog because the dog was jealous of his partner and causing issues in their relationship. The dog is now doing that with baby and has been doing that in our marriage. For example, the dog wants to steal the attention whenever my husband and I hug, kiss or hold hands... and my husband does end up giving the dog attention instead of me. \n\nWe haven't consulted a dog trainer because my husband does not have the patience and he gets upset with me whenever I bring up seeing a dog trainer.", "created_utc": 1675581993, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10u6sml/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_get_rid_of_his_dog/", "score": 825, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Plus regular brushing and grooming if pets while shedding.", "NTA. I think you're getting a lot of YTA responses because Reddit tends to be obsessed with dogs (which I get--I'm a dog lover, too!). But I can hear your frustration and I think it's completely valid. Your husband seems to be oblivious to a potential threat to the baby's safety (dog aggression) AND is also not upholding his agreement to clean the floors. You're carrying a lot of mental load. I agree with others who suggested that your husband should agree to hiring a cleaning service if he isn't willing or able to consistently help with this. Is it possible for you to put the pup in doggy daycare to give you a bit of a breather during the week? I would recommend having the dog in a separate location in the house if he has shown aggression towards the baby, and hiring a trainer/behaviorist may be a good idea. \n\nAlso, it's crazy to me that people are glossing over the part where the dog was aggressive towards your baby.

Makes me doubt you a bit about the aggression, feels like you're looking for an excuse to get rid of the dog because of the hair.

You would be TA if this were just about dog hair, but growling at your baby is concerning behaviour.\n\nYou might want to try meeting your husband halfway, though. Can you ask that the dog work with a behaviourist, perhaps while temporarily living elsewhere for the safety of your baby?\n\nDo try to be sensitive to the fact that you're asking him to give up a pet with whom he has, I imagine, a deep emotional bond. He would likely feel grief.\n\nAs a separate issue, it sounds like you are really exhausted and struggling emotionally right now. You state that you have \"given up,\" which is quite concerning. Have you spoken with a doctor about postpartum depression?\n\nPerhaps if you're not feeling so overwhelmed, it will be easier to find a workable compromise regarding the dog.", "YTA\n\nYou moved in together, with the dog. At that point, it's on you to help that work. Being mad about it after the fact is no reason to put out the dog. \n\nIf the dog was a deal breaker, then you shouldn't have said \"I do\". \n\nDid you expect gim to change his feelings about the dog later?", "I\u2019m sorry to hear this past year has been rough. The first year of becoming a mum was one of the hardest for me too. I say this because I see some flags for PPD for you - the constant irritation, focus on cleaning, feelings of giving up. Please consider speaking a professional, as this shouldn\u2019t feel so overwhelming.\n\nThe fact that yourself and husband disagree on the dogs behaviour suggests that we don\u2019t have the whole story - it could be that he is too relaxed or that you are too on edge. I can\u2019t be sure on this either way.\n\nI understand that from your perspective the dog is a real threat to your baby. You are a wonderful mother for protecting him. \n\nThat said - your husband came with the dog. You knew that when you got married. Suggesting he gets rid of the dog will likely drive a wedge between you. That said, there are more steps between incidents of concern and getting rid of the dog - keeping them physically separate / attending training / etc. \n\nYTA - there is more you can do here", "Nta, the husband isn't doing what he needs to do. The dog and babies health matters. Id talk to him first but if nothing happens then he should rehome the dog because he is obviously not happy rn (the dog)", " NTA!

You would have known from the get-go he has a dog, so it's on you to either put up with it or leave him.", "ESH. You don't like the dog. You're using the baby as an excuse. \"Get rid of the dog\" is not an appropriate response to your husband's pet, which I'm sure he loves. The dog can be locked away from the child.\n\nYour husband, however, is minimising his dog's behaviour. It *is* concerning that the dog growls at a child.\n\nYou two need to talk. Tell your husband that the dog needs to be evaluated at the very least. Taken to a dog behaviourist who will be able to evaluate the dog for it's current behaviour and trainability. If the behaviourist decides the dog needs training, he needs to commit to the training for the safety of your child. If the behaviourist says the dog will never be safe around your child he needs to understand that *is* an ultimatum. If he refuses to have to dog assessed you both need to consider why that is. If he is afraid they'll tell you to get rid of the dog, then he recognises there's something wrong and has decided to ignore it. If he thinks there is genuinely nothing wrong then his judgement and should not be trusted alone with your child and the dog.", "I\u2019ll never understand couples who move in just before/after the wedding. It\u2019s like you want the marriage to be stressful from the go.", "I am going to probably be a different from many responses here and say ESH...\n\n1) I do agree with the assessment of others that the dog issue should have been taken care of ahead of marriage and having a kid. At the very least, there needed to be better communication about how much it all bothered you. That way, you could have backed out OR additional conversations and compromises could be reached. My husband had a dog (who I also considered my dog) when he lived alone, and I did end up cleaning up after it a lot. I was willing to do that, but if I hadn't been, I would have made my husband do it.  In this case, it doesn't sound like you consider the dog part of the family like I did, so the cleaning and upkeep issue one is a bigger one in your relationship. \n\n2) I also think your husband sucks here for being in denial about the dog. The dog is a ticking time bomb, and you are going to regret it if you don't take care of this IMMEDIATELY.  Dog trainers are something you can look into, but they aren't magical, so if that doesn't work, you may need to rehome the dog for the safety of the baby.  Not all dogs are compatible with small kids. Source: Traumatic personal experience involving the dog we both loved from point #1", "NTA. Kid takes priority over dog.

You asked your partner to clean up after the dog (and clean the floors) when you moved in together.  He is not.\n\nMore importantly, he doesn't see it as \"serious or of concern\" that a dog is growling at and attempting to bite a one year old?  Irresponsible pet owner AND father right there.  From your description of past behavior, this dog is not comfortable around kids.  And maybe training would help; but if your husband doesn't see the problem, is he going to put in the work to train the dog?  From your follow-up comments, that seems very unlikely.\n\nSo if your husband won't clean up after this dog (as he previously agreed to) and he won't put in the time or money to train it to not harm your child, you don't really have any other choices.  It's time to rehome this dog.", "Leave it to reddit to be completely unreasonable and defensive when they hear \"dog\"", "NTA.

I have my assumptions...\n\nI don't understand why so many people are calling you the asshole, because a dog growling and getting jealous towards your baby is very concerning. It is a bit misleading how you worded it, because you made it seem like the growling is as bad as the hairs and your dislike of dogs, but a growling dog is just an accident waiting to happen. Even if you're always present when dog and baby are in the same room, you cannot always see it coming and definitely cannot prevent it. I do understand it might be hard for your husband, but he must understand the severity of how dangerous an aggitated dog can be right? So NTA.", "NTA. if the dog is being aggressive then it needs to go. There have been too many cases lately of dogs mauling children and it's not worth the risk.

Both of you need to level up your education in dog owning. Reach out to your local vet for good resources. Yes, even a big adult dog can go to puppy classes.  Most dogs are actually \\*happier\\* when they are trained well, because they are part of the pack.

Keeping an active toddler and a dog separated 24/7 is extremely difficult and stressful. Do you keep the dog constantly confined to one room or force it to live outside? Some have suggested that you might be overreacting. Here\u2019s a way to establish if that is true or not. You and hubby need to get an appointment with an animal behaviorist. These are veterinarians who have done additional training in animal behavior. If the behaviorist says the dog is a danger to your baby/should not be in a house with children, etc, then the dog needs to go. Behaviorists can also prescribe medication and recommend specific trainers and training methods. However, progress may take months or even years. Unfortunately, behaviorists are rare and most have extended wait times for appointments. See if your husband will agree to this if you both agree to abide by the behaviorist\u2019s recommendations. I would also film any concerning interactions between the dog and the baby. A trainer or behaviorist might be able to give you some insight. The hair issue should be a lot easier to fix.

Dogs can't speak.  They communicate with body language and vocalizations like growling.  It is on you to teach baby to read the signs, and how to properly approach dogs - even at a year old, you can reinforce this.  \n\nAs well, your own anxiety is feeding into the dog's.  The dog has, by now, no doubt integrated you into the family, and thus feeds off your mental state.

We moved in together one week before we got married. Before getting married, I always felt disgusted when I would visit him because his house always had dog hair everywhere. Whenever I left, I would find dog hair on my clothes, in my shoes etc... and that really annoyed me. So when we moved in together, I made it clear to my husband that I wouldn't want a dirty house, and I refuse to clean after his dog. At the time, he agreed he would clean the floors and be the one to clean after the dog. \n\nA year ago, we had our first baby boy. I am very protective over my son. As a mother, I want to make sure he is safe and has a clean home where he can play freely. Previously, when the dog has encountered babies or kids, he is always very anxious, nervous, and protective of my husband. With our baby, his behaviour is worse. Now that our baby is walking and running around the house, the dog can not find a safe space and is anxious the entire time baby is awake and walking. This past month, the dog has growled at baby when baby was walking towards him and on a different occasion the dog went in to bite baby when the baby caught him off guard and got close enough to touch him. Not to mention how jealous the dog gets anytime my husband is playing with baby. My husband was there for both of these incidents and denies them as being anything serious or of concern... I felt the opposite. \n\nThis past year has been the hardest year of my life as a first time mom. Not only do I not find a moment in the day to have a moment for myself, I definitely do not want to spend any free time I have cleaning after the dog, my husband, or baby. There is dog hair everywhere, the floors are always dirty with dirt, mud, dog drool, dog hair...etc. the carpet has a layer of dog hair on it. I find dog hair in all my clothes, my food, my cups, in my butt crack. I am so disgusted and annoyed at this point and it takes too much of my mental and physical energy to keep up. I am so unhappy. \n\nFor the past few months I've just given up. My husband has noticed and he's picking up after me. He's been cleaning the house (but not the floors) and cooking occasionally. He's doing the best he can because he sees I'm frustrated... but still it's not enough. I am really grateful for my husband and tell him that everyday. But I want the dog out of here. Am I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "ESH\n\nEveryone else has explained why you\u2019re the asshole, but your husbands flippant reaction to the dog growling and almost biting the kid is also a problem here. Jealousy in animals can turn dangerous, especially when it\u2019s toward a kid. You should contact a behaviourist/dog trainer/dog psychologist to help you try and make it work between the dog and the kid.", "NAH. My unsolicited advice is 1) Get any carpet in the house replaced with vinyl flooring 2) Get one of the robot vacuums, they make mopping ones too. Set them to run two or three times a week. 3) Baby gates. Keep the dog and baby separated until the dog is trained and the baby is old enough to be taught not to \u201csurprise\u201d the dog. 4) Get the dog groomed professionally there should not be hair in your food and butt crack, although the image made me lol.\n\nThis is fixable. Will take money and work but it\u2019s all fixable. Good luck.", "INFO: have you consulted a trainer or a behaviorist?", "YTA you married him and you knew he has a dog.

If he sees the dog blatantly acting jealous, possessive and what not it should be common sense that he needs to step up and help OP take charge, not just continue to sit around and wait for others to do all the work pertaining to *his* dog and the household.

IF, and that\u2019s a big if, OP\u2019s husband is willing to fully commit to managing and changing the dog\u2019s behavior, rehoming may not be required. But OP, this means your husband needs to actively acknowledge that the dog is a threat to the baby\u2019s safety right now and he needs to step up and take the lead on this. \n\nYes dogs are family, but you wouldn\u2019t let family shit on the floor or try to bite your baby. He needs to decide fast if he\u2019s going to put the human beings in his life above being lazy with caring for the dog.\n\nETA gentle ESH, you\u2019ve gotta communicate this. I know you\u2019re overwhelmed but shutting down isn\u2019t going to get you closer to a fix here.

That is incompetence on whoever is walking the dog. If you know the dog has been stepping in mud, hose their feet and get an old towel to dry them before letting them in.\n\nBaby gates can be used for dogs as well. Set boundaries with the dog so they understand not to be near the baby during their playtime. You said the dog doesn\u2019t have a safe space; that is so important for animals. Invest in a kennel if you don\u2019t have one already and make it comfortable for them to go in and out of.\n\nAnimals do what animals do. If they are acting out, that is on the human.

Incompetence from the human will lead to bad behaviour.\n\nThere is no communication here or any attempt for a resolution here.

They come in a variety of price ranges and are worth the money. It won\u2019t solve all of your problems, but it will take care of a lot of the hair and dirt. Maybe get a different kind of rug to put by the doors so there\u2019s less mess when the dog comes in. Some people wipe their dog\u2019s paws, but I don\u2019t see that happening here. \n\nDog + baby: Everyone\u2019s suggestion of a behaviorist is a good idea, but that seems to be another thing that won\u2019t happen. Same with rehoming. Same with getting help from husband. So you have to figure this out.\n\nCreate a safe space for the dog. The baby should never be allowed to enter the space or interfere with it. It can be a crate or a room or giant dog bed. Just somewhere he can go and be fully away from the baby. \n\nExercise the dog. He needs more walks or ball throwing or time at doggie playcare. He\u2019s less likely to divert energy to guarding if he has spent his energy running and playing. \n\nWork on your relationship with the dog. You don\u2019t hate dogs but you have bad energy with this one because your husband hasn\u2019t been responsible about cleaning and training. None of that is the dog\u2019s fault. Do some light training with him. Sit, stay, drop it, etc. Give him lots of pats and catch him being good. Groom him! If he enjoys being brushed that will help with the dog hair and will be a bonding experience. Try to maintain a calm energy around him. They pick up on very subtle body language. \n\nWork on your baby\u2019s relationship with the dog. After you\u2019ve walked or played with the dog and he\u2019s relaxed, let your baby dump his food in the bowl or drop a treat filled Kong. If the baby throws food off the high chair, don\u2019t stop the dog from eating it. You want to be careful not to create a situation where the dog feels like he has to protect his food from the baby. It needs to be more that he sees the baby as providing yummy stuff. When walking the dog, take the baby in a stroller or carrier so the dog gets used to him without having to worry about him getting too close. Always stay within arm\u2019s reach of the baby when the dog is around and heavily supervise. Reward the dog for being chill when the baby is around. Don\u2019t only address problematic behavior. Reward the good stuff too. \n\nSee if you can find training info online or even a reputable behaviorist that would maybe do a virtual or phone consult with you. Your husband doesn\u2019t have to be involved.  \n\nIdk what to tell you about your husband problem. Y\u2019all don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re good partners right now. This can be turned around but will take effort from both of you. Even if he won\u2019t go to therapy, you can. You can also look into whether an antidepressant would be helpful. Leaving is an option, but then you\u2019re baby will probably be having unsupervised visits with him and the dog. So, maybe see if you can make it work first. I wish you all the best. NTA", "NTA.

Yes, OP doesn't like the dog hair and the mess but obviously it hasn't been a deal breaker. What IS a deal breaker is the dog exhibiting aggressive behavior towards their baby to the point that he's snapped at him when the baby is just close. Granted, this is just OP's side of the story, but if the dog wasn't acclimated to the baby's presence and is so anxious around him (whether that be from lack of trying or any efforts to do so didn't work) that Jr. just being close to him causes such a serious reaction, this is an incredibly dangerous situation. OP bringing up the hair, slobber, and mud again is just the straw that's breaking the camel's back.\n\nBecause of the dog's aggressive behavior, NTA.

First, you moved in, got married and went through with a pregnancy while being in an environment you really didn\u2019t want to be in.

Baby has a room, you have a room and the dog needs it\u2019s space. If I came barging into your space in a poopy diaper acting like a baby does and possibly throwing random things and potentially hitting you I am pretty sure you\u2019d want me as far away from you as possible. \n\nI feel bad for the dog and baby. Babies don\u2019t understand, but from a young age they need to be taught to let the dog have their space too.

Can\u2019t speak for what the brother did, but it sounds like this dog was neglected and not given its own space from day one. Much like baby, dogs are also a member of the family and should be treated just as fairly. You corner an animal and make it feel like it\u2019s in danger, it\u2019s bound to snap back.

You need to spend time with the dog bonding to it as well. I would recommend you take an obedience course with the dog and your husband.

That way you can bond with, get to know, and establish control of the dog. I'm surprised you two married knowing that you hate dogs and he loves them. The dog is picking up on your animosity and anxiety. If if doesn't learn to trust you something terrible will happen.", "ESH. Why does the dog not have a safe place to go? The dog absolutely needs a safe place to go. Not having that will just make things worse. The baby must be watched at all times when the dog is around. If the dog seems irritated, he needs to be encouraged to go to his safe place. Your son also needs to be redirected from the dog. It will take a lot of repetition, but kids will learn how to interact with pets if you\u2019re consistent. However, it\u2019s imperative that the animal have a safe place. You\u2019re both doing the dog a disservice currently. It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s had much training. \n\nAs for the mess, I don\u2019t know what type of dog it is, but that sounds like a lot of mess.

My uncle had a Newfoundland and didn\u2019t have that much of a mess. I\u2019d explore if you can keep the dog out of certain areas where the mess bothers you the most. The kitchen maybe? I\u2019d also make sure you\u2019re both contributing to the cleaning and have a regular schedule. I vacuum every 2-3 days, which makes a huge difference.

Your concerns and fears are important and need to be listened to and addressed. I have several thoughts:\n\nTHE DOG Bringing a new infant into the house can be a very stressful event for our pets. If a dog is displaying aggressive behavior towards the new infant, this must be addressed immediately. You need to find a safe place for the dog away from the child now. You might start with a temporary separation, bring in an dog behaviorist to review the situation, and train the dog (and both of you).  If training works, the dog could return home. Or you give it up - even if it's hard. But you need an outside assessment of the dogs behavior - this should not be an argument btwn you and your husband. this doesn't seem to be a new problem and it needs to be addressed immediately. Immediately.  Your husband must work towards a solution with you not ignore it. He must agree to work with the behaviorist and trainer. Breaking that ends any consideration of keeping it he dog. Not because the dog is bad but because he is s a bad owner.  . \n\n(Personally I don't think you don't like dogs, I think you don't like this dog.

Your home needs to be clean. \nNext, it sound like the dog isn't the only issue with cleaning. It's HARD to clean with a newborn and the standards or clean enough change pretty dramatically.

Acknowledge that it's hard to keep a house clean enough for a baby and work from there  \n\nYou and your husband need to determine how house cleaning is going to get done, how often, and how well. Standards must be discussed not just tasks. If you can afford a cleaning person 2-4x week for the next year, I would invest in that on top of a daily cleaning plan. Invest in a robot vacuum - mine was $90 on an Amazon sale. Get two if you have two stories. You can run it daily and it's amazing. I would add a steam mop for tile areas - it's the easiest way to clean a tile floor. Just keep the kiddo away from the mop head.

Find one that resonates with you. \n\nYOU - You've acknowledged that you may be suffering from PPD. And some of what you have written sounds like this may be part of the problem.

If neither of you are willing to do this the dog needs to go for its own good, before it's forced into a position that ends up with it being PTS.

If the classes don't alleviate the issues then you should have a serious talk about rehoming. But rehoming isn't the first option.  Also the dog is probably not being groomed properly. A professional could help there as well. \n\nMost of us don't have the amount of money in our budget to simply add all those things in out of nowhere, you are likely not any different.

Little ones don\u2019t touch or play near the dog kennels - ever - because it\u2019s the dogs\u2019 safe space. We have baby gates set up at the top and bottom of each staircase (4 in total) and the littles are never in the same space as the dogs without immediate supervision - for the safety of both the dogs and the littles. Our large dog is an absolute teddy bear but I still closely supervise every interaction. Our little dog is a cranky little jerk but loves the littles from a distance\u2026 we still supervise every interaction within arms reach. He has warned them with a growl a time or two for getting too near his safe space boundary and we reinforce the communication from him (instead of being a silent snapper and biting without warning) by telling him good boy and relocating him to his more private kennel that\u2019s where he sleeps. He hasn\u2019t bitten the kids, but will warn with a growl if he feels unsafe so that is definitely behavior to reinforce. How else are dogs supposed to communicate they are uncomfortable? We have robot vacuums on all 3 levels of the house so dog hair is harder to find that human hair from the 4 girls (and long haired boy) in our home. Our home stays very tidy, and our kids ranging from <1 to 17 all play and do things they enjoy. Our house is lived in. We all contribute to our home. Even our <1 year old helps pick up toys and hands me laundry as I fold it. Both she and our 3 year old know the word \u201cgentle\u201d when interacting with the dogs and know to not just reach suddenly toward their heads. These are all things that can be taught, but it takes time, effort, and constant attention to train dogs and tiny humans together. OP, please communicate with your husband in a healthy way about your needs so they can be met and your home can be safe for everyone that lives there.

Kicking the problem further and further down the road is how you wound up in a place where you hate your husband, want to escape, and are feeling miserable and trapped and coated in dog hair.\n\nIf your now husband couldn't keep his home clean before you married him, there was little chance or incentive of those skills magically appearing once married. Putting a pause on the relationship until he kept his own house clean on his own for a certain stretch of time would have been an excellent test, but hindsight is 20/20 and all that.\n\nThis is a complicated problem and will require a complicated solution. For one, pregnant women and new moms having a total attitude change regarding pets is very common. It's a known phenomenon. Plus, your current situation appears to have sent you spiralling into a deep funk and it may take more than getting rid of the dog to get you out.\n\nYou need to be telling your husband how much you are currently hating your life and how miserable you are. \n\nYour husband needs to be cleaning everything, listening to your concerns and taking them seriously, and working with you on coming up with active solutions to resolving the situation. That might include rehoming the dog, buying a Roomba, obedience training, getting a cleaning service, never allowing dog and baby alone together, etc. \n\nHe needs to painfully clear on the fact that there are no more chances after this.

I correct simple behaviors we dont approve of ( licking baby), and commend good behaviors (laying at the foot of babys jumper, sitting by baby at the high chair, checking on baby when they nap in the crib)\n\nThat dog was part of his family before you. You should have learned to embrace the dog before you married the man. We are stewards of animals we shelter and share our families with. They arent disposable because its inconvenient to you. \n\nExcessive dog hair is a common thing among certain breeds, long hairs and double coated dogs shed more visibly than others and more often. Our dogs shed 100% of the time. GSD are seasonal blowouts, constant shedding. \nIf you dont brush the dog or at least take it to the groomers, you are not doing it right. \n\nNow that I think about it, rehoming the dog might be a good idea, considering you cant be bothered to understand that dogs are mentally small children their whole lives, and I couldnt bare living with someone who neglected me. Thebdog might be smart, but emotionally? Its a 3 year old with a 5 second attention span. If you have caused that dog to be unsure of you by treating it poorly, it will always revert to its place of safety and comfort... it's human dad. \n\nYou can either do better, do some research on the breed, look up how to train the dog, and get it to the groomer... or continue to sit in your misery because you couldnt be inconvenienced to do it beforehand, or destroy your relationship with your partner by forcing him to give up his four legged child... which I promise you, will cause resentment. \n\nIve been a new mom with pets.

If you see signs of resource guarding and separation anxiety you need to deal with it NOW. Either get professional training or find another home for the dog.

I understand that he promised he would clean up but you know that he wouldn\u2019t stick to that because he didn\u2019t clean up after his dog before you got married. I have 3 dogs who come inside so I understand how annoying it can be. It requires daily vacuuming and wiping down surfaces. Asking him to get rid of the dog at this time is unreasonable. You knew how the dog was before you brought a child into your lives. A biting dog is a no no and the dog requires correcting whenever it acts aggressive towards anyone but especially a child. That being said, there are ways to mitigate the risk. For example, the dog needs to have a safe space where they can get away from the child. Whether it is blocking off an area for the dog, or blocking off an area for the child, keeping them separated is important. Allowing the dog a space where the child can\u2019t get to it and a space that is away from the noise and chaos is vital. Never leave the child around the dog unsupervised. If your husband doesn\u2019t supervise properly then don\u2019t leave the child alone with your husband while the dog is around. It\u2019s not fair to keep the dog locked up or away at all times, so you should come up with a schedule for times when the dog can come out and be with the family without having to interact with the child. For example, while the child is sleeping throughout the day, or when it\u2019s relaxation time for everyone. Also it sounds like your dog needs play time. You or your husband should be wearing that dog out before allowing it around your child. It has to be able to work out it\u2019s pent up energy otherwise you will continue to have tense situations as you mentioned above. Don\u2019t allow the child around the dog at feeding time because it can result in a negative outcome. Basically play, eat, and sleep, is the dog\u2019s routine. As your child gets older, you can teach it to properly play with the dog. You can integrate your child into the feeding routine. Right now, you need to teach them to both respect each other and each others spaces. If you stick to a proper routine, then eventually you can integrate the child and dog into the same space at the same time. Your child isn\u2019t too young to learn how to treat the dog, and your dog isn\u2019t too old to learn how to treat your child. It takes time, patience, and dedication, by all involved. Getting rid of the dog isn\u2019t the only option and asking your husband to get rid of it is unfair. You can\u2019t let your negative bias of the dog and the cleaning required sway your child. If you hate the dog then your child will learn to hate it too. It sounds like you made your mind up the first time you saw your husband\u2019s place and have let your feelings about that lead your opinion of the dog and that\u2019s not fair. The dog can\u2019t help how much it sheds. It can\u2019t help that your husband doesn\u2019t clean up after it. You need to have a long talk with your husband about what is expected and about setting up a schedule and routine for cleaning, the dog, and your child, so your house can run better than it is now. Giving up, as easy as it seems, isn\u2019t the answer. If that\u2019s your choice then give up outside of the home. If it seems like you have already made up your mind, then you should leave. Take your child elsewhere so you only have yourself and your child to clean up after, and your husband can stay in the house to clean up after himself and the dog. You two can go back to a dating only relationship since that seemed to work better for the two of you than residing in the same household.", "All of the people on here talking about training/teaching the child boundaries are delusional in thinking they\u2019re such great parents because their children are so smart.

Pat yourselves on the back for your superiority but this dog is going to bite the child, not \u201cif\u201d but when.

Unbelievable.", "ESH- you suck because you\u2019re not communicating although it\u2019s possible that your husband kind of knows what the problem is. Your husband sucks because he\u2019s in denial. The dog is jealous and this could turn out very badly for your son. I actually work with and show dogs. This behavior needs to be addressed. Some dogs do not like small children and if you don\u2019t have a place to put the dog, where they can have their own space, an outdoor kennel for the day or some thing, then you may need to find him a home. I know that sucks for the dog, but you can\u2019t put the kid back. The kid is here to stay and if the dog bites the child nobody\u2019s gonna want a dog with a bite history and his chances of being euthanized go up drastically. And you don\u2019t want the dog to bite the kid because bites can be very infectious, traumatizing, and can often be very severe. Because children are small, bits are often are to the face. My childhood dog that I had got when I turned nine did not like small children. She would just simply leave, go upstairs, or ask to go outside when my niece and nephew were over. But she had a place to go to get away. We were very aware of her uncomfortableness with them, and never push the situation. Little kids, because they are jerky when moving and unpredictable, can make dogs very uneasy. They\u2019re also loud and disruptive to a dog especially one who\u2019s only been around adults until now. Your husband needs to take the dog situation very seriously because he could end up with a very bad scar on his face. Good luck", "...seriously, why did you even get married in the first place??

But the safety of my kids comes first, always. \n\nYour husband needs to step the fuck up, realize that his dog is actively endangering his child, and do something about it. Whether it is keeping them separate until baby is older and better able to understand boundaries and appropriate interactions with the dog, or training the dog, or rehoming the dog; he needs to do SOMETHING.\n\nOn your part, be very communicative with him about how much the dog\u2019s mess bothers you. If he can\u2019t be bothered to clean up after this pet that is so important to him, that does not bode well for his future consideration for other things that important to you. Have a brutally honest conversation with him about your needs, set firm boundaries and what will happen if he doesn\u2019t respect them, and if he doesn\u2019t respect them, follow through with your response.

This day I was running passed the couch and the dog jumped out from behind it and knocked me to the floor and bit my face. I won\u2019t go into details I will just say my father pulled the dog off me and took it outside for a minute and came back without it and we never saw it again. I was incredibly lucky and only had a small scar on my face that has long since faded. I don\u2019t even remember this incident yet even now at 37 years old I am still terrified of large dogs.

My husband and I had to rehome our dog because he bit me twice and 3 other people and we wouldn\u2019t put our daughter at risk. His biting was 100% out of anxiety and we found a really good home for him where he\u2019s able to live a very quiet life with people who are able to give him lots of attention and training. And most importantly, they don\u2019t have kids! Sometimes parents have to make these tough decisions but involve an expert first and until you get an expert involved, you really need to keep your baby and that dog separated.

I assume op hasn\u2019t spent much time around dogs based on the way she\u2019s ~~reacting~~ speaking. IF the dog\u2019s behaviour really is as described, then the first step is to do more to make the two comfortable with one another (I highly doubt much effort has been made since op hasn\u2019t made an effort herself). Op married a man who ALREADY had a dog. Dog was there first and she knew it when they started dating, when they moved in together, when they got married, and when they decided to bring a child into the world. It sounds like op did not do much to communicate concerns about the dog at any of these stages. You can\u2019t say \u201cwe have a baby now, dog needs to go\u201d. Like it or not, dog is part of the family as much as MIL, SIL, step kids, etc. Every effort needs to be made (controlled interaction, training (for both), possibly professional training, etc), before getting rid of the dog is at all a consideration. \n\nAdditionally, this dog is someone that your husband genuinely loves, the thought of asking him to get rid of it should not be appealing to you.  Even if you don\u2019t love the dog yourself, asking your partner to abandon something/one he loves so much should still be incredibly hard for you. Of course the baby\u2019s safety is a priority, but you\u2019re skipping so many steps because you think you see a potential out.\n\nEdit: changed a world and fixed typo", "Seriously - brush the dog and/or take it for grooming.

When my wife was about 8 months along she couldn't stand Sookie and actually took her to the humane society for adoption. When I got home from work she was in tears and felt horrible about it.

At the time it felt like the right thing to do for everyone.
