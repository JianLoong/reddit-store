We moved in together one week before we got married. Before getting married, I always felt disgusted when I would visit him because his house always had dog hair everywhere. Whenever I left, I would find dog hair on my clothes, in my shoes etc... and that really annoyed me. So when we moved in together, I made it clear to my husband that I wouldn't want a dirty house, and I refuse to clean after his dog. At the time, he agreed he would clean the floors and be the one to clean after the dog. \n\nA year ago, we had our first baby boy. I am very protective over my son. As a mother, I want to make sure he is safe and has a clean home where he can play freely. Previously, when the dog has encountered babies or kids, he is always very anxious, nervous, and protective of my husband. With our baby, his behaviour is worse. Now that our baby is walking and running around the house, the dog can not find a safe space and is anxious the entire time baby is awake and walking. This past month, the dog has growled at baby when baby was walking towards him and on a different occasion the dog went in to bite baby when the baby caught him off guard and got close enough to touch him. Not to mention how jealous the dog gets anytime my husband is playing with baby. My husband was there for both of these incidents and denies them as being anything serious or of concern... I felt the opposite. \n\nThis past year has been the hardest year of my life as a first time mom. Not only do I not find a moment in the day to have a moment for myself, I definitely do not want to spend any free time I have cleaning after the dog, my husband, or baby. There is dog hair everywhere, the floors are always dirty with dirt, mud, dog drool, dog hair...etc. the carpet has a layer of dog hair on it. I find dog hair in all my clothes, my food, my cups, in my butt crack. I am so disgusted and annoyed at this point and it takes too much of my mental and physical energy to keep up. I am so unhappy. \n\nFor the past few months I've just given up. My husband has noticed and he's picking up after me. He's been cleaning the house (but not the floors) and cooking occasionally. He's doing the best he can because he sees I'm frustrated... but still it's not enough. I am really grateful for my husband and tell him that everyday. But I want the dog out of here.

But I can hear your frustration and I think it's completely valid. Your husband seems to be oblivious to a potential threat to the baby's safety (dog aggression) AND is also not upholding his agreement to clean the floors. You're carrying a lot of mental load. I agree with others who suggested that your husband should agree to hiring a cleaning service if he isn't willing or able to consistently help with this. Is it possible for you to put the pup in doggy daycare to give you a bit of a breather during the week? I would recommend having the dog in a separate location in the house if he has shown aggression towards the baby, and hiring a trainer/behaviorist may be a good idea. \n\nAlso, it's crazy to me that people are glossing over the part where the dog was aggressive towards your baby.

Makes me doubt you a bit about the aggression, feels like you're looking for an excuse to get rid of the dog because of the hair.

You would be TA if this were just about dog hair, but growling at your baby is concerning behaviour.\n\nYou might want to try meeting your husband halfway, though. Can you ask that the dog work with a behaviourist, perhaps while temporarily living elsewhere for the safety of your baby?\n\nDo try to be sensitive to the fact that you're asking him to give up a pet with whom he has, I imagine, a deep emotional bond. He would likely feel deep grief.\n\nAs a separate issue, it sounds like you are really exhausted and struggling emotionally right now. You state that you have \"given up,\" which is quite concerning.

Please consider speaking a professional, as this shouldn\u2019t feel so overwhelming.\n\nThe fact that yourself and husband disagree on the dogs behaviour suggests that we don\u2019t have the whole story - it could be that he is too relaxed or that you are too on edge.

You are a wonderful mother for protecting him. \n\nThat said - your husband came with the dog. You knew that when you got married.

You're using the baby as an excuse. \"Get rid of the dog\" is not an appropriate response to your husband's pet, which I'm sure he loves. The dog can be locked away from the child.\n\nYour husband, however, is minimising his dog's behaviour. It *is* concerning that the dog growls at a child.\n\nYou two need to talk. Tell your husband that the dog needs to be evaluated at the very least. Taken to a dog behaviourist who will be able to evaluate the dog for it's current behaviour and trainability. If the behaviourist decides the dog needs training, he needs to commit to the training for the safety of your child. If the behaviourist says the dog will never be safe around your child he needs to understand that *is* an ultimatum. If he refuses to have to dog assessed you both need to consider why that is. If he is afraid they'll tell you to get rid of the dog, then he recognises there's something wrong and has decided to ignore it. If he thinks there is genuinely nothing wrong then his judgement and should not be trusted alone with your child and the dog.", "I\u2019ll never understand couples who move in just before/after the wedding. It\u2019s like you want the marriage to be stressful from the go.", "I am going to probably be a different from many responses here and say ESH...\n\n1) I do agree with the assessment of others that the dog issue should have been taken care of ahead of marriage and having a kid. At the very least, there needed to be better communication about how much it all bothered you. That way, you could have backed out OR additional conversations and compromises could be reached. My husband had a dog (who I also considered my dog) when he lived alone, and I did end up cleaning up after it a lot. I was willing to do that, but if I hadn't been, I would have made my husband do it.  In this case, it doesn't sound like you consider the dog part of the family like I did, so the cleaning and upkeep issue one is a bigger one in your relationship. \n\n2) I also think your husband sucks here for being in denial about the dog. The dog is a ticking time bomb, and you are going to regret it if you don't take care of this IMMEDIATELY.  Dog trainers are something you can look into, but they aren't magical, so if that doesn't work, you may need to rehome the dog for the safety of the baby.  Not all dogs are compatible with small kids. Source: Traumatic personal experience involving the dog we both loved from point #1", "NTA. Kid takes priority over dog.

You asked your partner to clean up after the dog (and clean the floors) when you moved in together.

From your description of past behavior, this dog is not comfortable around kids.  And maybe training would help; but if your husband doesn't see the problem, is he going to put in the work to train the dog?  From your follow-up comments, that seems very unlikely.\n\nSo if your husband won't clean up after this dog (as he previously agreed to) and he won't put in the time or money to train it to not harm your child, you don't really have any other choices.  It's time to rehome this dog.", "Leave it to reddit to be completely unreasonable and defensive when they hear \"dog\"", "NTA.

It is a bit misleading how you worded it, because you made it seem like the growling is as bad as the hairs and your dislike of dogs, but a growling dog is just an accident waiting to happen. Even if you're always present when dog and baby are in the same room, you cannot always see it coming and definitely cannot prevent it. I do understand it might be hard for your husband, but he must understand the severity of how dangerous an aggitated dog can be right? So NTA.", "NTA. if the dog is being aggressive then it needs to go. There have been too many cases lately of dogs mauling children and it's not worth the risk.

Same here\n\nIt honestly sounds like neither you OR husband have enough experience with dogs and that this stuff is like...not basic knowledge.  Both of you need to level up your education in dog owning. Reach out to your local vet for good resources. Yes, even a big adult dog can go to puppy classes.  Most dogs are actually \\*happier\\* when they are trained well, because they are part of the pack. Right now, your dog does not know.  \n\nIt also sounds like you need a professional cleaning service, if only to reset a starting point.  And a groomer.", "Yes. You are. \n\nYou knew this dude has a family member, it came before you. You don't like the family member so you decided it's in your right to break that family to make room for you. Cuz for some reason you're more important than the family member who was already there. That's selfishness. And you not even seeing that is entitlement. \n\nYou should've just dated someone who has no pets and learned not to leave your baby around to catch an antsy dog off guard before you decided to become a mother.", "YTA. \n\nyou sound like a real blast to be around. /s", "NTA - baby\u2019s safety is number one priority.

If I lived with a dog that was showing aggression towards my baby it would be gone. I would guess that not many people on this thread have dealt with a fear aggressive dog. It isn\u2019t easy. It sounds like this dog has had some longstanding behavioral issues-OP\u2019s brother in law couldn\u2019t keep the dog because of how it interacted with his partner. Keeping an active toddler and a dog separated 24/7 is extremely difficult and stressful. Do you keep the dog constantly confined to one room or force it to live outside? Some have suggested that you might be overreacting. Here\u2019s a way to establish if that is true or not. You and hubby need to get an appointment with an animal behaviorist. These are veterinarians who have done additional training in animal behavior. If the behaviorist says the dog is a danger to your baby/should not be in a house with children, etc, then the dog needs to go. Behaviorists can also prescribe medication and recommend specific trainers and training methods. However, progress may take months or even years. Unfortunately, behaviorists are rare and most have extended wait times for appointments. See if your husband will agree to this if you both agree to abide by the behaviorist\u2019s recommendations. I would also film any concerning interactions between the dog and the baby. A trainer or behaviorist might be able to give you some insight. The hair issue should be a lot easier to fix.

And yeah, some people will come in here saying that it's not the same thing, that it's just a dog, but it absolutely is - the dog is a member of the family, and it is a living thing that is loved.    \n\nAs for the anxiety and growling, this is all pretty normal behaviour for a dog.  Dogs can't speak.  They communicate with body language and vocalizations like growling.  It is on you to teach baby to read the signs, and how to properly approach dogs - even at a year old, you can reinforce this.  \n\nAs well, your own anxiety is feeding into the dog's.  The dog has, by now, no doubt integrated you into the family, and thus feeds off your mental state.  If you tense up and worry every time the baby is anywhere near the dog, the dog will see that as a reason to tense up and worry around the baby.

That shit is reckless parenting. I dont care if the dog is your husbands responsibility, you let a baby crawl near a sneering dog. What if it bit your kid? That could kill/seriously hurt the baby, or it could force you to have to put the dog down. You should never let babies go near even calm tempered dogs, since babies have no clue how to interact with them and a dog can get irritated if the baby annoys it. \n\nWhen your kid is old enough you have to teach him to not prod/pull at the dog and to not go near its personal space.

We moved in together one week before we got married. Before getting married, I always felt disgusted when I would visit him because his house always had dog hair everywhere. Whenever I left, I would find dog hair on my clothes, in my shoes etc... and that really annoyed me. So when we moved in together, I made it clear to my husband that I wouldn't want a dirty house, and I refuse to clean after his dog. At the time, he agreed he would clean the floors and be the one to clean after the dog. \n\nA year ago, we had our first baby boy. I am very protective over my son. As a mother, I want to make sure he is safe and has a clean home where he can play freely. Previously, when the dog has encountered babies or kids, he is always very anxious, nervous, and protective of my husband. With our baby, his behaviour is worse. Now that our baby is walking and running around the house, the dog can not find a safe space and is anxious the entire time baby is awake and walking. This past month, the dog has growled at baby when baby was walking towards him and on a different occasion the dog went in to bite baby when the baby caught him off guard and got close enough to touch him. Not to mention how jealous the dog gets anytime my husband is playing with baby. My husband was there for both of these incidents and denies them as being anything serious or of concern... I felt the opposite. \n\nThis past year has been the hardest year of my life as a first time mom. Not only do I not find a moment in the day to have a moment for myself, I definitely do not want to spend any free time I have cleaning after the dog, my husband, or baby. There is dog hair everywhere, the floors are always dirty with dirt, mud, dog drool, dog hair...etc. the carpet has a layer of dog hair on it. I find dog hair in all my clothes, my food, my cups, in my butt crack. I am so disgusted and annoyed at this point and it takes too much of my mental and physical energy to keep up. I am so unhappy. \n\nFor the past few months I've just given up. My husband has noticed and he's picking up after me. He's been cleaning the house (but not the floors) and cooking occasionally. He's doing the best he can because he sees I'm frustrated... but still it's not enough. I am really grateful for my husband and tell him that everyday. But I want the dog out of here. Am I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "ESH\n\nEveryone else has explained why you\u2019re the asshole, but your husbands flippant reaction to the dog growling and almost biting the kid is also a problem here. Jealousy in animals can turn dangerous, especially when it\u2019s toward a kid. You should contact a behaviourist/dog trainer/dog psychologist to help you try and make it work between the dog and the kid.", "NAH. My unsolicited advice is 1) Get any carpet in the house replaced with vinyl flooring 2) Get one of the robot vacuums, they make mopping ones too. Set them to run two or three times a week. 3) Baby gates. Keep the dog and baby separated until the dog is trained and the baby is old enough to be taught not to \u201csurprise\u201d the dog. 4) Get the dog groomed professionally there should not be hair in your food and butt crack, although the image made me lol.\n\nThis is fixable. Will take money and work but it\u2019s all fixable. Good luck.", "INFO: have you consulted a trainer or a behaviorist?", "YTA you married him and you knew he has a dog.

If he sees the dog blatantly acting jealous, possessive and what not it should be common sense that he needs to step up and help OP take charge, not just continue to sit around and wait for others to do all the work pertaining to *his* dog and the household. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s in the wrong for wanting to keep his dog but he also shouldn\u2019t have to wait to always be asked about these things.", "They\u2019d an also look into training for the dog and something for the anxiety the dog. feels. I definitely agree that the lack of communication here is a huge issue.", "Correction, they need a certified behaviorist, dog is anxious and showing guarding tendencies around the husband. IF, and that\u2019s a big if, OP\u2019s husband is willing to fully commit to managing and changing the dog\u2019s behavior, rehoming may not be required. But OP, this means your husband needs to actively acknowledge that the dog is a threat to the baby\u2019s safety right now and he needs to step up and take the lead on this. \n\nYes dogs are family, but you wouldn\u2019t let family shit on the floor or try to bite your baby. He needs to decide fast if he\u2019s going to put the human beings in his life above being lazy with caring for the dog.\n\nETA gentle ESH, you\u2019ve gotta communicate this. I know you\u2019re overwhelmed but shutting down isn\u2019t going to get you closer to a fix here. If you\u2019re worried about him not taking your concerns seriously, set up a consultation with a behaviorist.

That is incompetence on whoever is walking the dog. If you know the dog has been stepping in mud, hose their feet and get an old towel to dry them before letting them in.\n\nBaby gates can be used for dogs as well. Set boundaries with the dog so they understand not to be near the baby during their playtime. You said the dog doesn\u2019t have a safe space; that is so important for animals. Invest in a kennel if you don\u2019t have one already and make it comfortable for them to go in and out of.\n\nAnimals do what animals do. If they are acting out, that is on the human. They are domesticated animals and have been living alongside humans for 100s of years. Incompetence from the human will lead to bad behaviour.\n\nThere is no communication here or any attempt for a resolution here. Work together instead of against eachother to learn about dogs and how to train them to be safe around babies. There are lots of articles online out there for that. Animal shelters get full of animals because of human ignorance. Is that what you want? For the dog to go to a shelter because you failed them?

Rehome the baby???\n\nESH for expecting him to be better post marriage", "There\u2019s a lot going on here. First, I think you would have gotten less hate if you\u2019d focused more on the growling and less on the dog hair. \n\nDog hair/ floors: Get a robot vacuum. They come in a variety of price ranges and are worth the money. It won\u2019t solve all of your problems, but it will take care of a lot of the hair and dirt. Maybe get a different kind of rug to put by the doors so there\u2019s less mess when the dog comes in. Some people wipe their dog\u2019s paws, but I don\u2019t see that happening here. \n\nDog + baby: Everyone\u2019s suggestion of a behaviorist is a good idea, but that seems to be another thing that won\u2019t happen. Same with rehoming. Same with getting help from husband. So you have to figure this out.\n\nCreate a safe space for the dog. The baby should never be allowed to enter the space or interfere with it. It can be a crate or a room or giant dog bed. Just somewhere he can go and be fully away from the baby. \n\nExercise the dog. He needs more walks or ball throwing or time at doggie playcare. He\u2019s less likely to divert energy to guarding if he has spent his energy running and playing. \n\nWork on your relationship with the dog. You don\u2019t hate dogs but you have bad energy with this one because your husband hasn\u2019t been responsible about cleaning and training. None of that is the dog\u2019s fault. Do some light training with him. Sit, stay, drop it, etc. Give him lots of pats and catch him being good. Groom him! If he enjoys being brushed that will help with the dog hair and will be a bonding experience. Try to maintain a calm energy around him. They pick up on very subtle body language. \n\nWork on your baby\u2019s relationship with the dog. After you\u2019ve walked or played with the dog and he\u2019s relaxed, let your baby dump his food in the bowl or drop a treat filled Kong. If the baby throws food off the high chair, don\u2019t stop the dog from eating it. You want to be careful not to create a situation where the dog feels like he has to protect his food from the baby. It needs to be more that he sees the baby as providing yummy stuff. When walking the dog, take the baby in a stroller or carrier so the dog gets used to him without having to worry about him getting too close. Always stay within arm\u2019s reach of the baby when the dog is around and heavily supervise. Reward the dog for being chill when the baby is around. Don\u2019t only address problematic behavior. Reward the good stuff too. \n\nSee if you can find training info online or even a reputable behaviorist that would maybe do a virtual or phone consult with you. Your husband doesn\u2019t have to be involved.  \n\nIdk what to tell you about your husband problem. Y\u2019all don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re good partners right now. This can be turned around but will take effort from both of you. Even if he won\u2019t go to therapy, you can. You can also look into whether an antidepressant would be helpful. Leaving is an option, but then you\u2019re baby will probably be having unsupervised visits with him and the dog. So, maybe see if you can make it work first. I wish you all the best. NTA", "NTA. I've had my child bitten by a family dog. It is terrifying and awful. Talk to your husband, see if he is willing to start picking up after the dog and actively training her to be less possessive, and see where you can go from there.", "I swear, people latch on to stuff and ignore the most glaring issues in these posts. Yes, OP doesn't like the dog hair and the mess but obviously it hasn't been a deal breaker. What IS a deal breaker is the dog exhibiting aggressive behavior towards their baby to the point that he's snapped at him when the baby is just close. Granted, this is just OP's side of the story, but if the dog wasn't acclimated to the baby's presence and is so anxious around him (whether that be from lack of trying or any efforts to do so didn't work) that Jr. just being close to him causes such a serious reaction, this is an incredibly dangerous situation. OP bringing up the hair, slobber, and mud again is just the straw that's breaking the camel's back.\n\nBecause of the dog's aggressive behavior, NTA. OP's husband should not be sweeping this under the rug because the next thing that's going to happen is that someone's going to be bitten, whether that be the baby or someone who gets caught in the crossfire (source: the nice scar I have on my face from a similar situation).", "This is ESH. First, you moved in, got married and went through with a pregnancy while being in an environment you really didn\u2019t want to be in. Second, husband needs to wake the hell up and get some training for that dog. Third, as a parent around any animal, you can\u2019t let kids invade an animals safe space. Baby has a room, you have a room and the dog needs it\u2019s space. If I came barging into your space in a poopy diaper acting like a baby does and possibly throwing random things and potentially hitting you I am pretty sure you\u2019d want me as far away from you as possible. \n\nI feel bad for the dog and baby. Babies don\u2019t understand, but from a young age they need to be taught to let the dog have their space too. And the dog doesn\u2019t know any better because no one has paid much attention to him or her to realize there needs to be some training. Can\u2019t speak for what the brother did, but it sounds like this dog was neglected and not given its own space from day one. Much like baby, dogs are also a member of the family and should be treated just as fairly. You corner an animal and make it feel like it\u2019s in danger, it\u2019s bound to snap back. That could be within 2 feet or 10 feet. No difference. \n\nAgain, ESH. You\u2019ve got PPD and you need medication and help before it gets worse.

You need to communicate to your husband you concerns and come up with a plan, resorting to rehome the dog when nothing has been done to resolve the issues is not okay. The dog should not be shedding that much, there could be an underlying health concern, an inadequate diet, and a lack of proper grooming. You seem unwilling to work as a team to make everyone more comfortable. If dog is growling at baby then you both need to take a more active role in teaching your child to respect the dogs boundaries and training the dog, invest in baby gates, keep them separate.

Some dogs just don't mix with young family. (Yes, that may well be down to training, but it was the husband's job to train the dog when he re-homed it.)", "It sounds to me like the dog is strongly bonded to your husband and is protecting him. You need to spend time with the dog bonding to it as well. I would recommend you take an obedience course with the dog and your husband. You can talk to the trainer about the behaviors that concern you. YOU should be the primary person to do the training course. That way you can bond with, get to know, and establish control of the dog. I'm surprised you two married knowing that you hate dogs and he loves them. The dog is picking up on your animosity and anxiety. If if doesn't learn to trust you something terrible will happen.", "ESH. Why does the dog not have a safe place to go? The dog absolutely needs a safe place to go. Not having that will just make things worse. The baby must be watched at all times when the dog is around. If the dog seems irritated, he needs to be encouraged to go to his safe place. Your son also needs to be redirected from the dog. It will take a lot of repetition, but kids will learn how to interact with pets if you\u2019re consistent. However, it\u2019s imperative that the animal have a safe place. You\u2019re both doing the dog a disservice currently. It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s had much training. \n\nAs for the mess, I don\u2019t know what type of dog it is, but that sounds like a lot of mess. I\u2019ve never once found dog or cat hair in my butt crack despite having two cats who shed a lot and one dog that sheds constantly. My uncle had a Newfoundland and didn\u2019t have that much of a mess. I\u2019d explore if you can keep the dog out of certain areas where the mess bothers you the most. The kitchen maybe? I\u2019d also make sure you\u2019re both contributing to the cleaning and have a regular schedule. I vacuum every 2-3 days, which makes a huge difference. If you can get cleaners to come in every week or every other week, that would be good. \n\nI do think you\u2019re an AH for demanding the dog go when neither of you have done much to support the dog. However, it sounds like the dog might be better off with someone who will take the time to train him properly.", "It sounds to me like you are having such a hard first year and I am so sorry. Your concerns and fears are important and need to be listened to and addressed. I have several thoughts:\n\nTHE DOG Bringing a new infant into the house can be a very stressful event for our pets. If a dog is displaying aggressive behavior towards the new infant, this must be addressed immediately. You need to find a safe place for the dog away from the child now. You might start with a temporary separation, bring in an dog behaviorist to review the situation, and train the dog (and both of you).  If training works, the dog could return home. Or you give it up - even if it's hard. But you need an outside assessment of the dogs behavior - this should not be an argument btwn you and your husband. this doesn't seem to be a new problem and it needs to be addressed immediately. Immediately.  Your husband must work towards a solution with you not ignore it. He must agree to work with the behaviorist and trainer. Breaking that ends any consideration of keeping it he dog. Not because the dog is bad but because he is s a bad owner.  . \n\n(Personally I don't think you don't like dogs, I think you don't like this dog. And that's ok).\n\nCLEANING  Invest in a good deep cleaning by professionals. Right now. You both have so much on your plates to do this hard work.  Your home needs to be clean. \nNext, it sound like the dog isn't the only issue with cleaning. It's HARD to clean with a newborn and the standards or clean enough change pretty dramatically. And it sounds like it's not happening. The dog is making it worse but it's not the only problem. This isn't blaming one or both of you. It's just acknowledging the situation. Acknowledge that it's hard to keep a house clean enough for a baby and work from there  \n\nYou and your husband need to determine how house cleaning is going to get done, how often, and how well. Standards must be discussed not just tasks. If you can afford a cleaning person 2-4x week for the next year, I would invest in that on top of a daily cleaning plan. Invest in a robot vacuum - mine was $90 on an Amazon sale. Get two if you have two stories. You can run it daily and it's amazing. I would add a steam mop for tile areas - it's the easiest way to clean a tile floor. Just keep the kiddo away from the mop head. There are lots of resources in the longer run for managing cleaning in the house while managing life, children, depression. Find one that resonates with you. \n\nYOU - You've acknowledged that you may be suffering from PPD. And some of what you have written sounds like this may be part of the problem.   You must be healthy. You must take care of yourself. Get a diagnosis. Get help now. This week. No excuses.\n\nYOUR HUSBAND - You and your husband are having problems communicating.

If the classes don't alleviate the issues then you should have a serious talk about rehoming. But rehoming isn't the first option.  Also the dog is probably not being groomed properly. A professional could help there as well. \n\nMost of us don't have the amount of money in our budget to simply add all those things in out of nowhere, you are likely not any different.

It's hard to be in problem-solving mode when you're feeling like that.", "But she\u2019s always hated dog hair, he committed to cleaning and now\nDoesn\u2019t \n\nAnd the dog tried to bite the kid \n\nThis is not all in her head FFS\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not saying this situation isn\u2019t exacerbating any PPD I\u2019m saying we can\u2019t say the only reason this is an issue is because OP has PPD.", "Meh? One of our dogs hates kids but we work with her. She is never alone with our kid and we make sure she always has a place to get away when needed. As a parent, it's your responsibility to create a safe space for everyone involved. Including the animals. \nOP knew this going in but doesn't seem interested in helping the dog be more comfortable in the home. She just wants it gone.", "The lady who hates dogs says that once the dog \u201cwent in to bite\u201d the baby\u2026. If the dog wanted to bite the baby, it would have.  It didn\u2019t.  I\u2019m guessing OP antagonizes the dog, lets baby pull it\u2019s tail etc. and the dog growls to try and teach the baby- since OP clearly isn\u2019t teaching the baby how to behave with animals", "If your husband is in denial about his dog\u2019s behavior, that\u2019s dangerous. Too many people will say \u201cmy dog would never do that\u201d then someone ends up getting really hurt because they can\u2019t properly assess their animals\u2019 behavior. It\u2019s not the dog\u2019s fault, you\u2019re probably right when you say the changes in the home are causing the dog to become more anxious and lash out. But your husband needs to take responsibility and work through those behaviors instead of denying that they\u2019re even happening.", "You can\u2019t just rehome a dog when they\u2019re getting older. Imagine giving your kid away when they\u2019re 4 or 5 or however old your child is. And before anyone jumps on me and says \u201cdogs aren\u2019t children\u201d you can fuck right off. I would NEVER give up my dog for adoption or rehoming it after I\u2019ve spent x amount of years with them. That\u2019s not fair to the dog. So yeah put your child in it\u2019s place and try rehoming your child.", "I have no idea why this is getting downvoted so much bc it is such key information in understanding WHY your husband is being so unreasonable here. This needs to be in the original post. \n\nHubs feels guilty about not training the dog and doesn\u2019t want to let his brother down by rehoming the dog again so he\u2019s ignoring the problem. \n\nBut the dog was displaying territorial aggression before your husband even took it in. Keeping this dog is putting your son at risk. Your husband needs to wake up. \n\nOP, please stop focusing on the hair and mud part of this because the real danger - that this dog is eventually going to bite- is getting swept under the rug (no pun intended).", "The dog snapped at your baby. Are you willing to further risk your child's safety while the dog may be getting trained? To me it would be a no brainer that it's either the dog or the husband and the dog that will be gone from the house.", "Wow. Your husband is a complete asshole. I am so sorry that he is so dismissive and neglectful to you and the dog.", "Have you told him to send the dog back to his brother or give it to someone who is more responsible sorry but the baby is more important than a dog", "How guilty will y'all feel after the dog bites that baby? I can't believe you're unconcerned about it", "He has no patience then tell him to get rid of the dog I would be mad because the brother pretty much dumped a aggressive dog on you", "Yeah, it is absolutely a lifelong commitment.  If the animal has severe agression issues, which is not the case here at all, than euthinasia or specialized care situation is appropriate.  Which is not a demand to get rid of because you don't want a dog or ita fur around, this is a whim wrapped in concern.", "With her HUSBAND", "Yes, cats. Which are vastly superior to dogs in just about every possible way and she wouldn't be having this issue with a cat instead.", "OR\n\nyou can leave and then the dog will be around good owners. It's just that easy!", "Without anything other than strong words \n\nWhich you suggest more of, as a solution. \n\nThey communicated. He committed to cleaning. \n\nThey spoke when the dog nearly bit their baby. They disagree. \n\nBut OP has to convince him to care about their kid and her?", "All three of my nephews were taught to respect the animals in our house from the moment they were old enough to learn anything. We have a fear aggressive cat who will scratch anyone who tries to touch him that isn't me, and because we were all consistent with teaching the kids, not a single one of the three kids has ever been harmed by him.", "The parents have the capacity to provide a safe space for both the dog and child. They make plenty of crates and gating systems that an area should be created to keep them apart at times the parents can't be there to monitor the child's behaviors. Many dogs are freaked out by children's unpredictable behaviors. Create an environment that works for everyone. This mom is just creating a hostile house for eveyone", ">Yeah cause a 1 year old has the capacity to know that lmao.\n\nYou can't leave them alone at that age with a dog but You have clearly never raised a 1 year old. I have 3 kids, 26, 22 and 14. I promise they all know how to act around a dog by that age! \n\nFrankly, by 6 to 8 months they knew. \n\nAgain, I wouldn't leave them alone but they most definitely knew by 1. \n\nUnderstanding how to work with dogs is ingrained into our DNA in the same way we are into theirs. \n\n30 thousand years of evolution is no joke. \n\nI think kids and adults forget as they age, assuming they weren't taught at a young age, but if you ever watch a puppy and a baby grow up together you would see that there is this instinctive understanding. \n\n**Again, the relationship needs adult supervision**, but to say kids and dogs don't get each other is misguided.", "If it doesn't have that capacity (i mean, duh, of course it doesn't), you should NOT leave the baby and dog alone together? Keep your baby out of the way of the dog if you know the dog can retaliate because of that. And teach the dog the baby is okay via exposure. \nIt's plainly ignorant and really fucking dangerous for parents to leave their infants with dogs, especially knowing the dog already IS this anxious?! I can't get over this. And then they get all surprised if the dog actually does end up biting the kid.", "Please don\u2019t underestimate the intelligence of a non verbal and developing child.", "They do actually.", "You\u2019d be surprised what a 1yo is capable of learning, amigo \ud83d\ude42", "One year olds understand \"no\". It starts simple, we aren't asking the toddler to give the dog dental surgery. \n\n...until he is at least 3.", "One year olds understand \"no\". It starts simple, we aren't asking the toddler to give the dog dental surgery. \n\n...until he is at least 3. \n\nBut also husband/dad needs to decide whether or not he is going to be fairnto his dog AND his family and step up. He should have looked into dog training the minute they found out they were pregnant, and he should be watching that dog like a hawk, when it is near the baby. No wonder OP is frustrated. Even though she signed up for having a dog and a baby and getting rid of the dog would be unfair, husband/father needs to be her PARTNER not her 2nd child.", "A one year old can understand the word \u201cno\u201d and can be redirected. No child should be left alone with a dog, so the parents should be watching them and correct the behavior.", "Ah I left out a word lol he doesn\u2019t clean adequately for sure", "The husband is refusing to find solutions. \n\nOP\u2019s solution: clean after your dog. \n\nHusband dropped that promise. \n\nOP: it\u2019s an issue that the dog is so anxious with the baby. I\u2019m worried. He nearly bit him. \n\nHusband: nah it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll just let the dog feel anxious and won\u2019t consider a gated area or any training. \n\nLike did I miss the part where OPs husband is unaware of the concerns while also being totally incompetent?!", "Because she clearly doesn\u2019t hate them so much she doesn\u2019t want to live with them. This wasn\u2019t an issue until a) husband broke his commitment to clean adequately after the dog and b) the dog posed a threat to the safety of their baby", "She tolerated the dog up until the dog became a threat to her child\u2019s safety, and her husband stopped fulfilling his commitment to clean up after it. Cleanliness aside , any dog who is a threat to small children should not be around them.", "11 for me. I was just sitting on the floor at a bday party and the cocker spaniel just walked up to me and attacked my face. No noise made beforehand, no interaction between us, nothing. Found out later the dog previously bit other people.", "I completely agree that it's a valid part of her stress. I just think that the great solutions you propose, and others, will seem more realistic and possible to her if she's feeling better emotionally.\n\nAs will everything. She's clearly overwhelmed and struggling right now, and that's what concerns me even more than the dog issue. The mental health symptoms I hear in her post are really a separate issue, and a very urgent one.", "I did not say it's the only reason. I explicitly stated that the dog's behaviour is concerning. Of course it's not in her head.\n\nI introduced the PPD as a separate issue because it is separate. She doesn't like the dog, for various valid reasons; separately, she is struggling emotionally. Both are important issues that need to be solved.", "People can also chose who to move in with.   \nHe was fine with everything, she wasn't. He's still in denial about dog needing proper training. She was aware of the possible problem and did nothing to address it before it became a problem. He still thinks there's no problem. She says something and shuts up because he gets angry.  \nDog and kid are screwed.", "She knew the husband didn\u2019t clean up after the dog not that the dog would try to *bite the baby!* In s perfect world this could be a fixable problem but Op\u2019s husband won\u2019t even acknowledge it\u2019s a problem or clean up after the dog so I don\u2019t see that happening here.", "I disagree and so does OP. She does not have to take care of his dog. Full stop.", "Their relationship preceded the dog. The dog was husband\u2019s brother\u2019s but was rehomed for displaying \u201cjealousy towards his gf,\u201d or what animal behaviorists call territorial aggression.

OP says the dog has been stressed and hasn\u2019t been able to relax since the baby arrived.\n\nThere has been no efforts to protect the dog from the baby who doesn\u2019t know any better than to invade the dogs space. \n\nThe dog and child need to be separated, and the dog needs to be trained, if not by her owner, then by a professional. \n\nObviously the baby\u2019s welfare is incredibly important, but this isn\u2019t one moment in a void, it\u2019s a year of things leading up to this.", "The baby\u2019s safety can\u2019t even be added to the discussion.

Why it wasn't talked about beforehand or a problem before a kid was introduced is beyond me.", "It's like my husband using a dish and me refusing to clean it because I didn't use it.

Full stop.", "I can\u2019t say I agree. The dog is part of the family way before the child was; the baby just roams the house freely in the dogs personal space.

There needs to be seperate spaces in the house for the dog and baby, for both of their sakes. And the dog should definitely be seen by a professional trainer to help with her quality of life as she seems to be very stressed and possessive", "That\u2019s not reasonable. OP doesn\u2019t know enough about dogs to have been able to name the behavior or predict what it would mean for the safety of a small child.

If the mum has so much of a problem with him, she can train him. They should have done it from the start, honestly. She said she hates dogs regardless. Separate rooms are a thing too.
