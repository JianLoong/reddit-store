We have two children together (6m) and (3f). \n\nShe takes care of house and babysits the kids most of the time because she's a SAHM but we evenly split chores and childcare on weekends and when I get home from work.\n\nMy wife is much more social than I am. We moved to her home state from mine because she was wanted to be closer to her parents and her childhood friends. Now, she is a lot more social than I am. She goes on 3-4 girls trips a year. I have no issues with that and I'm happy to babysit the kids full time in her absence. I'm more of a homebody anyway so I usually like to just paint in the spare room or play video games every once in a while instead of traveling out of state. I don't really take time off from work unless we do something as a family\n\nFor the past 3-4 months, I was very busy on a major project at work. I've been working 60 hour weeks and frankly I'm exhausted with the stress. So when the project was finally coming to an end, I told my wife I'm taking a day off and I won't be doing any work around the house. Of course, I'd still clean up after myself but I didn't want to do any chores or childcare on that one day. I told her that 2 weeks in advance and she agreed. I also reminded her three days before\n\nHowever, when that day came, my wife \"forgot\" about our agreement. I was in the painting room and my wife interrupted me telling me she needed me to give our daughter a bath because she spilt milk all over herself and couldn't do it because she had to wash the dishes. It was annoying but whatever, shit happens. Later on when I was playing video games, my wife tells me our son needs help for his math homework. I ask her why can't she help him herself, she said it's because she has some \"work\" to do. This work was actually her best friend coming over and chatting for an hour. This really pissed me off so after I helped my son and the best friend left, I told my wife I'm leaving the house for 4-5 hours. She asked me where I was going, I told her I'm just going to chill in the park and do whatever. But then she said needs me to help out with the chores and with the kids. I told her that today was my day off from all work including house work and it's her job to babysit the kids on this day before I left the house\n\nWhen I came back she was acting cold and called me an asshole for just abandoning her and the kids. I think she's being dramatic but when I spoke to my sister, she said parenting is a 24/7 job.

Or you'll need to go somewhere. Clearly she can't respect your needed time off when you are all at home together. It doesn't feel like a \"vacation\" that anyone is having to her at that moment. \n\nI think you are NTA. You need to have a discussion with your wife, though. If you otherwise like her, you need to talk through problems like this. Probably don't tell her she was \"dramatic.\" Remind her of the request you had to have a day off. Remind her of how many times you reminded her. And Remind her of all the girls trips she takes that you do not complain about. You are BOTH working full time. Her with the family, you at your job.

She broke the agreement you made together, then got mad that you left so she couldn't continue to rope you in on the one day you agreed you'd have to yourself.", "NTA.

It comes across as OP listening to his wifes needs and trying to meet them, even when requiering moving and giving her room to take several trips a year with her friends. \n\nWhile calling watching your own kids babysitting just irks me for societal reasons, it seems like OP and wife both use it, and they use it for when both of them are being with the kids, so it doesnt seem to be a sign of a larger problem in this instance.\n\nAll in all, unless OP is a wildly unreliable narrator (which could always be the case), its unfair of wife to say she is ok with the plan, and never let OP know that she is in fact not ok with the plan, act passive agressively and sabotaging the agreement he thought they had, and are now giving him the cold shoulder for something she agreed to do.", "NTA if your wife can also have days off.

The thing is, and you said it yourself, shit happens when you have young children and the only way you can be sure you're getting a break from it is if you're (hiring a babysitter or roping in family and) leaving the house. \n\nHere's where I think part of the issue is. You \"told\" your wife you were taking a day off, and would not be parenting that day. You \"reminded\" her three days in advance. Presumably she's been picking up the slack at home while you have been working 60 hour weeks for 3 to 4 months. At what point did you discuss with her if she could do with a break too? \n\nBecause honestly? If my husband \"informed\" me he was opting out of parenting for a day to do nothing besides sit on his hole and play computer games, when I had been doing the lion's share of work at home for 3 months, and I ended up having a bad day with the kids that day, and he moped about having to do basic parenting things and then walked out of the house in rage, I would be pretty pissed too.\n\nYou think this \"day off\" for you is equivalent to her going on a few \"girls trips\" a year, but is that her only break? Because 2 days off every 3 or 4 months is *not* a lot.\n\nAlso, she has her trips, you're working 60 hour weeks.

Being a parent itself is a 24/7 thing. So does she get breaks? Has she ever had a day off? \n\nWith the info given I would say E.S.H - more towards Y.T.A because it's your job as a parent to help, even if you needed a day off. It's called parenting not babysitting. It also seems like you had a bit of time to yourself that day too. But she also did get a break with her friend when there was work to be done.

OP does not go out, I feel like the situation is more E.S.H / NTA. OP, your self care is doing hobbies yes, but at the same time you are still looking after the kids. You guys do not have equal opportunities for self-care and that may be a problem. Just remember to not use the term babysitting next time because it's called parenting. And remember, the most important party in this situation is the kids. Remember to be a good dad to them! Good luck bro!", "YTA, for nothing more than continuing to refer to the maintenance of your children as \u201cbabysitting\u201d.

We have two children together (6m) and (3f). \n\nShe takes care of house and babysits the kids most of the time because she's a SAHM but we evenly split chores and childcare on weekends and when I get home from work.\n\nMy wife is much more social than I am. We moved to her home state from mine because she was wanted to be closer to her parents and her childhood friends. Now, she is a lot more social than I am. She goes on 3-4 girls trips a year. I have no issues with that and I'm happy to babysit the kids full time in her absence. I'm more of a homebody anyway so I usually like to just paint in the spare room or play video games every once in a while instead of traveling out of state. I don't really take time off from work unless we do something as a family\n\nFor the past 3-4 months, I was very busy on a major project at work. I've been working 60 hour weeks and frankly I'm exhausted with the stress. So when the project was finally coming to an end, I told my wife I'm taking a day off and I won't be doing any work around the house. Of course, I'd still clean up after myself but I didn't want to do any chores or childcare on that one day. I told her that 2 weeks in advance and she agreed. I also reminded her three days before\n\nHowever, when that day came, my wife \"forgot\" about our agreement. I was in the painting room and my wife interrupted me telling me she needed me to give our daughter a bath because she spilt milk all over herself and couldn't do it because she had to wash the dishes. It was annoying but whatever, shit happens. Later on when I was playing video games, my wife tells me our son needs help for his math homework. I ask her why can't she help him herself, she said it's because she has some \"work\" to do. This work was actually her best friend coming over and chatting for an hour. This really pissed me off so after I helped my son and the best friend left, I told my wife I'm leaving the house for 4-5 hours. She asked me where I was going, I told her I'm just going to chill in the park and do whatever. But then she said needs me to help out with the chores and with the kids. I told her that today was my day off from all work including house work and it's her job to babysit the kids on this day before I left the house\n\nWhen I came back she was acting cold and called me an asshole for just abandoning her and the kids. I think she's being dramatic but when I spoke to my sister, she said parenting is a 24/7 job. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
