{"id": 23463, "submission_id": "15dcgtl", "title": "AITA for telling my wife it's her job to babysit the kids and leaving the house?", "selftext": "I (35m) have been married to my wife (32f) for 7 years. We have two children together (6m) and (3f). \n\nShe takes care of house and babysits the kids most of the time because she's a SAHM but we evenly split chores and childcare on weekends and when I get home from work.\n\nMy wife is much more social than I am. We moved to her home state from mine because she was wanted to be closer to her parents and her childhood friends. Now, she is a lot more social than I am. She goes on 3-4 girls trips a year. I have no issues with that and I'm happy to babysit the kids full time in her absence. I'm more of a homebody anyway so I usually like to just paint in the spare room or play video games every once in a while instead of traveling out of state. I don't really take time off from work unless we do something as a family\n\nFor the past 3-4 months, I was very busy on a major project at work. I've been working 60 hour weeks and frankly I'm exhausted with the stress. So when the project was finally coming to an end, I told my wife I'm taking a day off and I won't be doing any work around the house. Of course, I'd still clean up after myself but I didn't want to do any chores or childcare on that one day. I told her that 2 weeks in advance and she agreed. I also reminded her three days before\n\nHowever, when that day came, my wife \"forgot\" about our agreement. I was in the painting room and my wife interrupted me telling me she needed me to give our daughter a bath because she spilt milk all over herself and couldn't do it because she had to wash the dishes. It was annoying but whatever, shit happens. Later on when I was playing video games, my wife tells me our son needs help for his math homework. I ask her why can't she help him herself, she said it's because she has some \"work\" to do. This work was actually her best friend coming over and chatting for an hour. This really pissed me off so after I helped my son and the best friend left, I told my wife I'm leaving the house for 4-5 hours. She asked me where I was going, I told her I'm just going to chill in the park and do whatever. But then she said needs me to help out with the chores and with the kids. I told her that today was my day off from all work including house work and it's her job to babysit the kids on this day before I left the house\n\nWhen I came back she was acting cold and called me an asshole for just abandoning her and the kids. I think she's being dramatic but when I spoke to my sister, she said parenting is a 24/7 job.

When your wife accused you of abandoning her and the kids, you should have asked her why she can take 3-4 trips a year to go with her girlfriends. I doubt a trip consist of one single day.

He's not lazy. He's not a deadbeat dad. He's just tired.\n\nNow, my judgment depends on if you give your wife a day to unwind herself. She also needs days off from being a parent from time to time.

Is this usual or would she do those things on a day where you hasn't asked for time off?\n\nYou're NTA because your wife takes 'time off\" from the kids 3-4 times a year to go away with her friends and she even takes time off during the day to see her friends. \n\nSo you're definitely not TA to ask for literally one day.

If I say to my wife hey are you cool if Saturday I just game all day and you watch the kids and she says yes, I assume she is going to make arrangements to keep the kids occupied, which is not difficult.

Or you'll need to go somewhere. Clearly she can't respect your needed time off when you are all at home together. It doesn't feel like a \"vacation\" that anyone is having to her at that moment. \n\nI think you are NTA. You need to have a discussion with your wife, though. If you otherwise like her, you need to talk through problems like this. Probably don't tell her she was \"dramatic.\" Remind her of the request you had to have a day off. Remind her of how many times you reminded her. And Remind her of all the girls trips she takes that you do not complain about. You are BOTH working full time. Her with the family, you at your job.

A lot of people are going to quibble over wording, but imo the only thing that matters in this case is that you asked your wife for the day off, she agreed, and you reminded her twice leading up to the day which she acknowledged. There were no emergencies or anything else that interrupted the normal schedule. She broke the agreement you made together, then got mad that you left so she couldn't continue to rope you in on the one day you agreed you'd have to yourself.", "NTA. Next time spend your day off elsewhere.

If she struggled with the schedule they could have looked at it together and found solutions. But she agreed to giving him the day off, clearly had a problem with giving him the day off, never communicated her problem and instead became what seems like a very passive agressive person for the day.\n\nConsidering they moved to her home state so she could be closer to family and friends, and he covers everything at home for the 3-4 girls trip she takes a year, this doesnt come across as OP being too demanding and taking a SAHP for granted, and wife has a support network around her as well and isnt isolated. It comes across as OP listening to his wifes needs and trying to meet them, even when requiering moving and giving her room to take several trips a year with her friends. \n\nWhile calling watching your own kids babysitting just irks me for societal reasons, it seems like OP and wife both use it, and they use it for when both of them are being with the kids, so it doesnt seem to be a sign of a larger problem in this instance.\n\nAll in all, unless OP is a wildly unreliable narrator (which could always be the case), its unfair of wife to say she is ok with the plan, and never let OP know that she is in fact not ok with the plan, act passive agressively and sabotaging the agreement he thought they had, and are now giving him the cold shoulder for something she agreed to do.", "NTA if your wife can also have days off.

Then what additionally saves you is the fact she got you to do something because she had work to do and it just happened to be her friend coming round.

The thing is, and you said it yourself, shit happens when you have young children and the only way you can be sure you're getting a break from it is if you're (hiring a babysitter or roping in family and) leaving the house. \n\nHere's where I think part of the issue is. You \"told\" your wife you were taking a day off, and would not be parenting that day. You \"reminded\" her three days in advance. Presumably she's been picking up the slack at home while you have been working 60 hour weeks for 3 to 4 months. At what point did you discuss with her if she could do with a break too? \n\nBecause honestly? If my husband \"informed\" me he was opting out of parenting for a day to do nothing besides sit on his hole and play computer games, when I had been doing the lion's share of work at home for 3 months, and I ended up having a bad day with the kids that day, and he moped about having to do basic parenting things and then walked out of the house in rage, I would be pretty pissed too.\n\nYou think this \"day off\" for you is equivalent to her going on a few \"girls trips\" a year, but is that her only break? Because 2 days off every 3 or 4 months is *not* a lot.\n\nAlso, she has her trips, you're working 60 hour weeks.

Being a parent itself is a 24/7 thing. So does she get breaks? Has she ever had a day off? \n\nWith the info given I would say E.S.H - more towards Y.T.A because it's your job as a parent to help, even if you needed a day off. It's called parenting not babysitting. It also seems like you had a bit of time to yourself that day too. But she also did get a break with her friend when there was work to be done.

Like bro that is literally a full time job.\n\nEDIT: After the info that the wife goes on girl trips a few times a year while OP takes care of them. OP does not go out, I feel like the situation is more NTA. OP, your self care is doing hobbies yes, but at the same time you are still looking after the kids. You guys do not have equal opportunities for self-care and that is a problem. Just remember to not use the term babysitting next time because it's called parenting. And remember, the most innocent party in this situation is the kids. Remember to be a good dad to them! Good luck bro!", "YTA, for nothing more than continuing to refer to the maintenance of your children as \u201cbabysitting\u201d. Bro, I was a single father for a long time, and it used to irk me so much when people said I was \u201cbabysitting\u201d my son. Pro tip: as a parent, you\u2019re not babysitting, you\u2019re raising. There\u2019s a fucking difference. \n\nAnd you are TA for thinking you are absolved from all responsibility just because you had a stressful period at work. Look man, I get it. I\u2019ve had those moments too, I\u2019ve had to ask my wife if it\u2019s okay if I take a short solo weekend trip before, just to get a minute to myself. All while offering her the same. They\u2019re very infrequent for both of us, but they\u2019ve happened. Like twice in my sons decade of life. \n\nYou are THERE.

We have two children together (6m) and (3f). \n\nShe takes care of house and babysits the kids most of the time because she's a SAHM but we evenly split chores and childcare on weekends and when I get home from work.\n\nMy wife is much more social than I am. We moved to her home state from mine because she was wanted to be closer to her parents and her childhood friends. Now, she is a lot more social than I am. She goes on 3-4 girls trips a year. I have no issues with that and I'm happy to babysit the kids full time in her absence. I'm more of a homebody anyway so I usually like to just paint in the spare room or play video games every once in a while instead of traveling out of state. I don't really take time off from work unless we do something as a family\n\nFor the past 3-4 months, I was very busy on a major project at work. I've been working 60 hour weeks and frankly I'm exhausted with the stress. So when the project was finally coming to an end, I told my wife I'm taking a day off and I won't be doing any work around the house. Of course, I'd still clean up after myself but I didn't want to do any chores or childcare on that one day. I told her that 2 weeks in advance and she agreed. I also reminded her three days before\n\nHowever, when that day came, my wife \"forgot\" about our agreement. I was in the painting room and my wife interrupted me telling me she needed me to give our daughter a bath because she spilt milk all over herself and couldn't do it because she had to wash the dishes. It was annoying but whatever, shit happens. Later on when I was playing video games, my wife tells me our son needs help for his math homework. I ask her why can't she help him herself, she said it's because she has some \"work\" to do. This work was actually her best friend coming over and chatting for an hour. This really pissed me off so after I helped my son and the best friend left, I told my wife I'm leaving the house for 4-5 hours. She asked me where I was going, I told her I'm just going to chill in the park and do whatever. But then she said needs me to help out with the chores and with the kids. I told her that today was my day off from all work including house work and it's her job to babysit the kids on this day before I left the house\n\nWhen I came back she was acting cold and called me an asshole for just abandoning her and the kids. I think she's being dramatic but when I spoke to my sister, she said parenting is a 24/7 job. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Being a parent 24/7 does not mean you never, ever get a water-cooler break.\n2. You describe a general division of labor that seems completely reasonable and fair. (I'm not hung up on you using the term 'babysitting' because you apply it equally to yourself/your wife to simply describe 'parenting'.)\n3. You note that you are happy to watch the kids solo while your wife enjoys \"3-4 girl trips a year\" (and probably plenty of other solo time while she socializes with her many local friends and family.\n4. You don't describe any times when she watches the kids solo (for you to visit your friends/family, travel, or just chill out with your hobbies).

(1) Dump one child care task on you while she entertains a friend; (2) have zero acknowledgement that she had previously agreed to give you this day for yourself and still actually expect you to help with chores and the kids.\n7. It is absolutely possible that she was tired from her extra hours of solo 'babysitting' while you were putting in your extra hours at work. But she did not convey that she needed her own break to you in any way. In fact, she simply agreed. When you reminded her of your 'day off' just a few days before, that was another opportunity for her to let you know if she needed time off too and coordinate that with you; she said nothing. (So we don't actually know if she were also burnt out; it is only considerate guessing on my part.)\n8. It's as if she has no awareness that you tackle those things solo when she's out socializing. You were not asking for a full weekend, just one day. You obliged with the first child-care task because (as you say, \"things happen\"). You even obliged with the completely avoidable 2nd child-care task she just chose to dump on you. So, she got her own 'down time' on YOUR one, rare, scheduled day off. When you decided to leave, she indirectly told you that she HAD BEEN PLANNING ON HAVING YOU HELP HER WITH CHORES AND CHILDCARE the whole time; without ever having communicated to you (1) why she felt that she should/needed to do that on this rare day off for you or (2) any immediate need for extra relief for her.\n9. You had to leave the house (not get to chill at home) in order to get away from her secret agenda to keep you busy with chores and childcare. While you were home, she intentionally dumped her work on you while she relaxed with a friend. And she's mad at you. For trying to have that planned time off for yourself.\n\nI hope you two can talk this out and get to better ground. Honestly, I think she's been happily oblivious to the downtime you enable her to have and letting you pick up her slack. I wonder if she thinks much about what you do for the family and for her.

The other instance I hear people use it is where the kids have to come to an adult event (like a wedding or something) and one parent assumes primary responsibility for watching/entertaining them.

Most everyone agrees it's challenging work, but when people are talking about how SAHPs deserve to earn the full salary of a cook, a maid, and a nanny, they've utterly lost the plot.", "> and she\u2019s thinking it will \u201conly\u201d be a moment of your help\u2026 rinse and repeat.\n\nThat doesn't explain inviting her friend over to talk.", "Agreed, personal version of hell.", "Art retreats my friend. You usually are in a nice cabin or hotel and you can eat local food and in the day you set up and paint, draw, whatever you art is. Am introverted too and it's actually not bad. It's usually small talk about art at meals. Rest of the day is for you, put those headphones in and just paint. Sometimes they do offer a demonstration, or a few lectures but those are not mandatory to attend (so take a nap)!\n\nAlso, rent a hotel room. I do it often. You can usually check in early. Enjoy the pool, relax, do whatever you want. I love bringing my Travel art kit with me and just use my room view as inspiration.", ".... Why would you ever agree to such an imbalance?
