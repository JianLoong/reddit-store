I moved into his families house with him when we were both 16 and developed a close relationship with his mom. So close to the point that I even call her mom. My husband has an older sister and a younger brother. His younger brother is married, but me and his wife never got along. We've had a lot of issues in the past (years ago) and it got really bad to the point where my husband and I moved out of his parents house and cut off contact with everyone.\n\nFast forward to present time, his brother's wife has tried to make amends with me multiple times over the years since it's been years and we both have kids now, like buying me/husband and our kids gift for Christmas, reaching out via my MIL etc. But I wasn't having any of it and refuse to have any contact with her, or allow my kids to have any contact with her kids (she has 3).\n\nMy MIL HATES that we don't get along and that every holiday she has to have two celebrations since she can't have everyone together. She tried to stay neutral and not take sides but it's obvious that she just wants her family to be together again.\n\nmy (5F) and (1F) daughters stay with my MIL from Monday-Friday while my husband and I work. They're at my MIL's house more than they're at ours. A few days ago my eldest daughter was talking to me about her week with grandma. She said her and her sister met some new friends this week and started giving the names of her 3 cousins, the ones we don't speak to. Apparently my MIL went to visit my BIL and his wife/ their kids and took my kids with them, since they're with her all the time. MIL never mentioned this to me at all, and I presume wasn't planning on telling me.\n\nSo I confronted my MIL and asked why she did this and didn't tell me? She explained that its been over 10 years and she is sick of keeping her grandkids away from each other and having this divide in the family. She said the fact that her sons don't speak has been killing her for years, and she doesn't think it's fair that my kids and my BIL's kids have never met due to some stupid drama that happened years ago. I told her I don't want my kids having anything to do with my BIL, his wife or their kids and that she needs to respect this or I will find somewhere else to leave my kids during the week. She was obviously upset about this.\n\nI was talking to my SIL (husbands older sister) and my niece about this and to my surprise they think this is kinda an AH move on my part. They said that they don't think it's fair that my kids won't get to ever build a relationship with their cousins due to some drama that happened over 10 years ago. They also said my MIL is doing my husband and I a favor buy watching our kids Monday-Friday without getting paid a cent, and that I shouldn't give her such a hard time\n\nWas this an AH move on my part?\n\nEDIT: I couldn't fit an explanation due to the word count but the drama that occurred between my SIL and I was that she used to constantly talk shit about me and make comments behind my back. One day I overheard her talking shit about me to my MIL and I confronted her. She tried to deny what she said and played that victim. Ever since then I cut ties with her and my BIL and want nothing to do with them. My MIL has always tried to stay neutral.

The lack of detail in the reason for conflict between you and SIL (which ofc you don't have to share if you don't feel comfortable), along with the fact that SIL has expressed a desire to reconcile, AS well as you seem to be downplaying your MIL's despair at the entire situation.

If your reason for them not being around was a safety issue of some kind, or indoctrination, or racism or something, I'd feel much differently. This is over catty gossip. You're also the AH for expecting MIL to not see her other relatives 5 days a week that she's watching your kids. \n\n\u2022MIL is the AH for not respecting the boundaries of the parents and not even asking or telling you about it. Keeping secrets about what she does involving your own kids is not okay. It's not her place to decide if the boundary is a valid one or not, it's not her choice what someone else's children are allowed to do. \n\n\u2022The other relatives are soft AH for only seeing that you're the AH when there are other AH's here too. \n\nAll of this seems to be happening over a lack of adults having adult conversations.

In this instance for example, you really expect her not to see her other grandkids for most of the year and control her life if you leave your kids with her (nearly every day!) - that\u2019s ridiculous.

So no one has the right to judge \n\nThe boundary was obvious and she knew she shouldn\u2019t do it \n\nMaybe going forward you may have to find new childcare", "NTA I would have been furious about the breach of trust. Get someone else to watch those kids. This woman has now become toxic and is no longer trust worthy.", "YTA. People say foolish things when they are young. It sounds like your SIL has grown up & trying to make amends. You should try growing up & accept the olive branch, otherwise you sound like an ungrateful child.", "YTA, if your MIL is giving you 5-day/wk full time childcare, and you\u2019re still acting like a middle schooler making their lives difficult just because SIL talking negatively about you a decade ago\u2026", "YTA", "So going against the grain with NTA, but I would love clairty of what the 'talk shit' entailed.\n\nYour MIL offered to watch your children, you had rules and boundaries that I would assume you would require out of any babysitter. Your MIL took your kids somewhere you clearly didn't want them to go, and had a reason to set this boundary. \n\nThis boundary is significant enough that your husband doesn't talk to his brother. Based on how most people tend to want to make their parents proud and get their approval tells me this situation may be more serious than you are letting on.\n\nThat being said; it's probably a good idea to iterate to MIL it isn't just about your kids meeting their cousins, it's that she broke your trust. And it's probably also a good idea for you to re-evalute your boundary. If you can talk to a therapist who can help you look objectively at the entire interactions it will help you know if you need to adapt or solidify your stance.\n\nI would also explain to your kids an age appropriate way for them to learn what is going on and see what their views on their cousins are and if your SIL has changed or if she was still talking bad about you to your kids. If they want contact with the cousins making it forbidden is just going to make them angry. A way for them to communicate between them (such as a video game where there are moderators) or visits with grandma without the parents (only after trust is rebuilt) would probably be the healthiest thing going forward I'd your boundary remains but your kids want to interact with their cousins", "NAH. I get it but keeping your MIL from allowing interaction between her grandkids is selfish and really not worth it.

She would not be watching them anymore. I would'nt even make it a threat.  They would already be enrolled in daycare.  I would let her be free to do whatever she wants. You don't teach my kid to keep secrets from me.  She should of told you she would be unable to watch your kids because she wants to see her other grandchildren.  Do, I think this has gone to far, yes.

You're not 16 anymore. It's time to have an adult conversation and build some boundaries but also try to repair that relationship. I'm not saying it'll be easy and I'm not saying that once you build those boundaries you won't decide that staying away from them is best.

It\u2019s not like she poked holes in your condoms or tried to fuck your husband. Sounds like she was a teenager when all this happened, it\u2019s time to let this shit go. Now yes, your MIL did overstep. But honestly, she has been WAY too accommodating of your nonsense, hosting multiple celebrations for one event. Your kids also LIVE with her basically full time and she gets paid\u2026 zero dollars for the privilege. It\u2019s pretty ridiculous that you think that it\u2019s okay to control her activities the vast majority of the time. Because again you\u2019re punishing little children who had nothing to do with this nonsense by saying that grandma can only see that set of grandkids only 2 days out of the week while the other grandkids get her 5 days a week every week.

That's the factor that you aren't accounting for. Your own kids go to school 6-8 hours a day, 5 days a week right?

If someone is doing you a favor, you don't really get to tell them how to do it unless there is an actual safety concern.\\* I might have more sympathy for OP if grandma only babysat occasionally or if the limits she wanted enforced were something small like no cookies before lunch, but she is essentially telling her MIL that she's not allowed to see the rest of her family for most of the week. That's just unreasonable. \n\nAnd OP is absolutely free to find another babysitter, no argument there. I'm not sure it's going to be as easy as she thinks, though, considering many cities have a wait of six months to a year for a spot in a qualified child care (and that's for parents that are willing to pay top dollar.)

Again sometimes CO parents make decisions that the other doesn't agree with.\n\nThe fact of the matter is the OP would be just as upset if the mother in law let them enter her house instead of taking them to the sister-in-law's house.

She knew very well that she was crossing your boundaries and dismissing your expectations as the babysitter and doing the one thing you told her you didn\u2019t want to happen. \n\nThis is not only shitty on her part, but it\u2019s also narcissistic and emotionally abusive.  She doesn\u2019t get to decide if you make amends. If she agreed to babysit knowing your conditions, then she should be held accountable for her actions. \n\nYour far better off finding different childcare providers for your children because she will definitely do it again.

This has to be a troll I can't imagine someone would be this awful.", "Right!  Like, you don\u2019t have to like someone to be around them 3-4 days a year and be civil ffs. People who make their families divide holidays/ birthdays etc without *extremely* good reasons are always TA.  \n\nA situation where your brother was having an affair with your fianc\u00e9 and now they\u2019re married, ok I get it. Even then, once it\u2019s been a decade or so, I still think it might be time to just be civil for the sake of the rest of the family. But at least that one has some merit. \n\nSomeone talked \u201cshit\u201d about you?  Sit at the other end of the table, and call it a day. The fact that she has even reached out to try to mend things, and OP is *still* acting this petty?

If the MIL was coming to the OPs home during the week to care for the kids, I might agree, but that's not happening. There are no real hours in the week outside of babysitting the OPs kids.", "I understand all of that. \n\nBut, with everything, communication is key.

I'd love to hear all about it.", "YTA mainly because you\u2019d decision doesn\u2019t just effect you I mean MIL watches you kids throughout the week which basically means she\u2019s not allowed to see the other grandkids, and is your husband allowed to see the family.", "Yeah...gaping.", "YTA she talked behind your back. I get it. That sucks and it\u2019s hurtful. She tried to make amends. That was right thing for her to do. Your reaction is to divide the families and punish the children over old hurt feelings.

You feel like you almost can\u2019t trust that your boundaries or that the well-being of your children can\u2019t be respected because of their own, personal, perceptions on life and \u201cfamily\u2026\u201d You feel livid because they can\u2019t do the simple task of keeping things separate and almost disrespected by their actions/justifications because they essentially went behind your (and your husband\u2019s) backs so the kids can \u201cget to know their family\u2026\u201d Trust me: I really do get it. I was in the same boat. Still, to this day, I am very conscious of who is allowed into our lives and why certain personality traits deserve to be kept away\u2026 \nHowever, I would say YTA (indirect) because you don\u2019t know the pain, regret and loss once that relationship is gone.  It becomes less about you and your personal fall out with these family members when your children never get an opportunity to ever have a relationship/experience with their aunt/uncle/cousins/etc. I am a bit biased now that I have experienced loss of one of these family members and although I would consider the relationship a complete wash\u2026 it did affect me (surprisingly) and I do now know how little the adversaries are compared to what my kiddos will never get to experience. \nIt does sound a lot like neutral ground, but it\u2019s very eye opening to think and know that a part of your children\u2019s life experiences/lineage has been cut short. Obviously, everyone\u2019s journey is different and the specifics can drastically range, but if there were ever a day where you can feel the slightest bit neutral about the situation then let your kids decide (very cautiously) and set them up for success by teaching them the tools they will need with certain personality types/scenarios.", "This is some P4 shit", "Definitely, YTA. Let it go sis.", "YTA. Get over yourself. Most people, like your SIL, grow up. You should try it. You owe it to your kids and MIL at least.", "NTA\n\nYour MIL knew the issues with SIL/BIL and still decided it was HER right to disregard YOUR boundaries. That\u2019s not on.

I'd be less concerned about what they're doing with their grandmother in that time and more concerned why I'm letting someone else raise my kids for like 90% of their life. That is just absurd.\n\nI understand that your work life may be demanding, but I'd drop my job in a heartbeat if it meant I had to sacrifice that much time out of my children's lives. And they're 4 and 1 years old? The time they should be forming strong bonds with their parents. Work can always wait until they're in school.\n\nAs for your mother in law taking them to see their cousins? Good on her. They need to meet the rest of their family and have every right to do so. You have no issue with dragging your MIL down over whatever conflict happened 10 years ago, but an issue with atleast hearing your SIL out after all this time? I don't know what happened between you two, but the very least you could do is hear her out and then decide whether it's something worth addressing or not, because dividing a family like that is heartbreaking and I feel sorry for not only your kids, MIL, SIL and BIL and their kids, but also sorry for you and your partner for missing out on family.", "YTA- and if I was your MIL I would have called your bluff. You think you will find someone to take care of your kids for free from Monday to Friday? What are you smoking. You think MIL is your maid who has to listen to your commands for years on end?

They thought it was hilarious! \n\nSo my mom is NC with my dads sisters, she wants nothing to do with them.  But she still sees his brother and mom, and my mom is still welcoming to my cousins.  She\u2019ll go to my cousins weddings and my grandparents anniversary party, even though the sisters are there.  She lets my cousins come visit, and she allows my siblings and I to go visit my cousins at my aunts houses (we\u2019re all adults now).  She\u2019s even allowed my dad to spend significant time this year with the sister that started the rumour because she\u2019s dying of lung cancer.  \n\nWhy? because she understands everyone else has their own connection.  It\u2019s healthier for my mom to be away from it, and she does stay away from it, but she knows it would cause harm if she never allowed her husband and kids to have a relationship with that side.  \n\nI hope OP sees this and thinks about it.
