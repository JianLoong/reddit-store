I moved into his families house with him when we were both 16 and developed a close relationship with his mom. So close to the point that I even call her mom. My husband has an older sister and a younger brother. His younger brother is married, but me and his wife never got along. We've had a lot of issues in the past (years ago) and it got really bad to the point where my husband and I moved out of his parents house and cut off contact with everyone.\n\nFast forward to present time, his brother's wife has tried to make amends with me multiple times over the years since it's been years and we both have kids now, like buying me/husband and our kids gift for Christmas, reaching out via my MIL etc. But I wasn't having any of it and refuse to have any contact with her, or allow my kids to have any contact with her kids (she has 3).\n\nMy MIL HATES that we don't get along and that every holiday she has to have two celebrations since she can't have everyone together. She tried to stay neutral and not take sides but it's obvious that she just wants her family to be together again.\n\nmy (5F) and (1F) daughters stay with my MIL from Monday-Friday while my husband and I work. They're at my MIL's house more than they're at ours. A few days ago my eldest daughter was talking to me about her week with grandma. She said her and her sister met some new friends this week and started giving the names of her 3 cousins, the ones we don't speak to. Apparently my MIL went to visit my BIL and his wife/ their kids and took my kids with them, since they're with her all the time. MIL never mentioned this to me at all, and I presume wasn't planning on telling me.\n\nSo I confronted my MIL and asked why she did this and didn't tell me? She explained that its been over 10 years and she is sick of keeping her grandkids away from each other and having this divide in the family. She said the fact that her sons don't speak has been killing her for years, and she doesn't think it's fair that my kids and my BIL's kids have never met due to some stupid drama that happened years ago. I told her I don't want my kids having anything to do with my BIL, his wife or their kids and that she needs to respect this or I will find somewhere else to leave my kids during the week. She was obviously upset about this.\n\nI was talking to my SIL (husbands older sister) and my niece about this and to my surprise they think this is kinda an AH move on my part. They said that they don't think it's fair that my kids won't get to ever build a relationship with their cousins due to some drama that happened over 10 years ago. They also said my MIL is doing my husband and I a favor buy watching our kids Monday-Friday without getting paid a cent, and that I shouldn't give her such a hard time\n\nWas this an AH move on my part?\n\nEDIT: I couldn't fit an explanation due to the word count but the drama that occurred between my SIL and I was that she used to constantly talk shit about me and make comments behind my back. One day I overheard her talking shit about me to my MIL and I confronted her. She tried to deny what she said and played that victim. Ever since then I cut ties with her and my BIL and want nothing to do with them. My MIL has always tried to stay neutral.

The lack of detail in the reason for conflict between you and SIL (which ofc you don't have to share if you don't feel comfortable), along with the fact that SIL has expressed a desire to reconcile, AS well as you seem to be downplaying your MIL's despair at the entire situation.

If your reason for them not being around was a safety issue of some kind, or indoctrination, or racism or something, I'd feel much differently. This is over catty gossip. You're also the AH for expecting MIL to not see her other relatives 5 days a week that she's watching your kids. \n\n\u2022MIL is the AH for not respecting the boundaries of the parents and not even asking or telling you about it. Keeping secrets about what she does involving your own kids is not okay. It's not her place to decide if the boundary is a valid one or not, it's not her choice what someone else's children are allowed to do. \n\n\u2022The other relatives are soft AH for only seeing that you're the AH when there are other AH's here too. \n\nAll of this seems to be happening over a lack of adults having adult conversations.

It sounds like you\u2019ve ripped this family apart permanently over something that could have been mended or outgrown. In this instance for example, you really expect her not to see her other grandkids for most of the year and control her life if you leave your kids with her (nearly every day!) - that\u2019s ridiculous.

So no one has the right to judge \n\nThe boundary was obvious and she knew she shouldn\u2019t do it \n\nMaybe going forward you may have to find new childcare", "NTA I would have been furious about the breach of trust. Get someone else to watch those kids. This woman has now become toxic and is no longer trust worthy.", "YTA. People say foolish things when they are young. It sounds like your SIL has grown up & trying to make amends. You should try growing up & accept the olive branch, otherwise you sound like an ungrateful child.", "YTA, if your MIL is giving you 5-day/wk full time childcare, and you\u2019re still acting like a middle schooler making their lives difficult just because SIL talking negatively about you a decade ago\u2026", "YTA", "So going against the grain with NTA, but I would love clairty of what the 'talk shit' entailed.\n\nYour MIL offered to watch your children, you had rules and boundaries that I would assume you would require out of any babysitter. Your MIL took your kids somewhere you clearly didn't want them to go, and had a reason to set this boundary. \n\nThis boundary is significant enough that your husband doesn't talk to his brother. Based on how most people tend to want to make their parents proud and get their approval tells me this situation may be more serious than you are letting on.\n\nThat being said; it's probably a good idea to iterate to MIL it isn't just about your kids meeting their cousins, it's that she broke your trust. And it's probably also a good idea for you to re-evalute your boundary. If you can talk to a therapist who can help you look objectively at the entire interactions it will help you know if you need to adapt or solidify your stance.\n\nI would also explain to your kids an age appropriate way for them to learn what is going on and see what their views on their cousins are and if your SIL has changed or if she was still talking bad about you to your kids. If they want contact with the cousins making it forbidden is just going to make them angry. A way for them to communicate between them (such as a video game where there are moderators) or visits with grandma without the parents (only after trust is rebuilt) would probably be the healthiest thing going forward I'd your boundary remains but your kids want to interact with their cousins", "NAH. I get it but keeping your MIL from allowing interaction between her grandkids is selfish and really not worth it.

She would not be watching them anymore. I would'nt even make it a threat.  They would already be enrolled in daycare.  I would let her be free to do whatever she wants. You don't teach my kid to keep secrets from me.  She should of told you she would be unable to watch your kids because she wants to see her other grandchildren.  Do, I think this has gone to far, yes.

You're not 16 anymore. It's time to have an adult conversation and build some boundaries but also try to repair that relationship. I'm not saying it'll be easy and I'm not saying that once you build those boundaries you won't decide that staying away from them is best.

It\u2019s not like she poked holes in your condoms or tried to fuck your husband. Sounds like she was a teenager when all this happened, it\u2019s time to let this shit go. Now yes, your MIL did overstep. But honestly, she has been WAY too accommodating of your nonsense, hosting multiple celebrations for one event. Your kids also LIVE with her basically full time and she gets paid\u2026 zero dollars for the privilege. It\u2019s pretty ridiculous that you think that it\u2019s okay to control her activities the vast majority of the time. Because again you\u2019re punishing little children who had nothing to do with this nonsense by saying that grandma can only see that set of grandkids only 2 days out of the week while the other grandkids get her 5 days a week every week.

Yes as the mother she should get to dictate who does and does not see her children. However she herself admitted in the post that the children are with her mother in law more than they are with her. That's not babysitting, that is co-parenting and sometimes the person that your co-parenting with does stuff that you don't agree with.  \n\nOP is TA  To her own children, her husband and his entire family.   All because she can't get over something that happened when she was a kid. Maybe OP can't believe that her sister-in-law outgrew it since it seems to be something she's incapable of.", "That\u2019s for sure, just saying that it\u2019s not 24hrs a day", "I could be wrong but it reads to me as if MIL literally keeps the children on weekdays and OP has them on weekends.\n\nIf it is just childcare from 8-5 on weekdays. Then, my position will completely change.", "OP stated the kids spend more time at MIL's house than at theirs and they stay with MIL Monday through Friday. If they spend 50.1% of the week with MIL over just 5 days, that means they're there 17 hours a day, which makes is extremely unlikely they're being taken home for the remaining 7 hours of the day. That's not simple babysitting. That means MIL is child rearing, raising her grandchildren for free.", "If the kids are at MIL's more than OP's, I think its 24 hours. 50.1% of a week condensed to 5 days is 17 hours a day. No one is taking a 1 and a 5 year old home for 7 hours to return them back to the same place. No way someone does that.", "The post reads Monday-Friday and talking about their week with and at grandmas. If I\u2019m speaking about my kids school I say they go Monday-Friday that doesn\u2019t mean I leave them there.", "Yeah I\u2019m going to assume Monday - Friday means what it means for most of us parents until it\u2019s clarified by the OP otherwise.", "Did you miss the part where OP says they're at MIL's house more often than OP's? That's the factor that you aren't accounting for. Your own kids go to school 6-8 hours a week, right? They don't spend more time at school than in your home because they have 16-18 hours of every weekday in their own home plus 48 hours of the weekend. So 128-138 hours out of school. OP says Monday-Friday, her kids stay with MIL and they're with her more than at OP's home."]}
