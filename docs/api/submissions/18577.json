Big deal if she gets pissed.  Better to have her pissed for whatever time frame she wants than lose your daughter. Plus how great of a wife can she be if she would get pissed over something like that.  Most women would have been throwing clothes on and racing out the door or at least shoving their husbands out the door screaming go go go so you could at least see her in her cap and gown.
