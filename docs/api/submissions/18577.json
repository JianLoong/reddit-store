Your current wife wants you away from your daughter, no loving partner would be like this if they cared remotely about you having a relationship with your daughter. Open your eyes and stop having your wife dictate how you will or won't be a father. She sucks at it.", "Why did you ask for the day off? You know, since you are claiming you didn't know it was your daughter's graduation that day.... Suspicious", "Bro you missed your daughter's birthday for a fucking *line cook* job? Jesus Christ dude you can get another one in ten minutes just knocking on a couple doors (source: was a line cook all over the USA and Latin America for over 10 years)", "Dude works in kitchens man. You can get fired and get a job two doors down within an hour. It's legitimately the easiest industry to get a job in.", "He seems narcissistic. Nothing is ever his fault, it's everyone else! Why even try when it's easier to just do nothing and blame it on someone else. I know why his ex divorced him (yes I am making that assumption).", "He's ridiculous. And you're probably right!\n\n>It really seems like he doesn\u2019t even like his daughter.\n\nHe says he loves her, but nothing about like. And I am getting very strong dislike from his text.", "yes, this is definitely a \u201cand out of nowhere, she got a divorce lawyer\u201d kind of guy.", "He already chose. \n\nHe chose his wife.", "I mean it's pretty obvious since he already chose his wife by not going to her graduation because of her", "That's not a fair question.", "By next week, some other websites will have republished this and then even MORE people will be mad at him. Ain't it grand??? lol", "That\u2019s what i was wondering. Or i could even see the mom throwing a party for her 15 or 16 year old to celebrate with her friends, and not being there because i can guarantee most 16 year olds would rather celebrate with their friends without their parents hanging about.", "I asked for her birthday off. I'm bad at remembering shit but I'm not that bad", "Emphasis on objectifying the body in terms of the labor it can produce and the resulting disparity between people with different bodies. It\u2019s a thing.", "Because she is his \"daughter\" , he has to love her or else he is the asshole to society. Nothing says he has to like her or see her as a person. Otherwise he would not let such trivial matters get in the way of him seeing her or planning to see her in the future. \n\nHe was probably glad he got the date wrong so he had a convenient excuse not to drive. \nI know I might be stretching it, but he portrays a very poor image of himself in the little amount he wrote.", "How old is new wife? Why do I get the feeling she's not much older than his daughter?", "Yes, I wanted to see him say it", "It is.  That's a totally normal question that remarried people have to face.  \n\nThe answer should have 100% immediately been \"my daughter\".  \n\nThe fact that you're fighting back on answering proves you're undeniably an AH.  \n\nWhen you became a parent your kid became the most important thing for you to be responsible for.  Your kid only recently turned 18, which meant for the last 18 years it should have been drilled into your skull that she was your primary reason for doing anything or else shouldn't have been a parent.  But you shrugged that off so easily that it's obvious you never took this seriously.\n\nYou never explained to your wife that your daughter was more important.  And it appears that's because you never did find your daughter to be important.", "Let\u2019s rephrase it then. Between your wife and your daughter, whose feelings hold more weight in situations like these?", "If your wife doesn't support you supporting your daughter, why are you with her? You messed up, it sounds like it's quite normal as well. It's her graduation. It only happens once. YTA.", "You already answered: you pick the one you fvck and your daughter doesn't care.\n\nYTA deadbeat, sperm donor, absent father.", "And yet, it is.\n\nYou picked your wife over your daughter when your spine collapsed in the face of her griping about having to drive 2 hours to her ONLY high school graduation.  Do you plan to keep picking your wife?  Because you\u2019ll completely screw your relationship with your kid if you do.", "You only don't think it's a fair question because you know the answer makes you the bad guy.", "Let\u2019s make it easier: do you choose to go to your daughter\u2019s once in a lifetime achievement or to spend a completely unremarkable day with your wife? Because it doesn\u2019t sound like there were conflicting plans. Your wife didn\u2019t have something important going on.", "No, your daughter got screwed over by your decision to choose work over her even though you had zero obligation to go in and work.", "Sounds like nothing in your life is your fault or your responsibility. Good luck with that. \n\nYTA", "I mean, if I book off work for an important event, I\u2019m not going to work. Simple as that.", "Jesus Christ dude. Take responsibility and stand up for yourself instead of blaming everyone and anyone else. YOU need to do better. How you made it this far in life blaming everyone else for your problems baffles me. Grow up.", "So by the logic of \"I need to go otherwise I'll be fired\", since the rest of the rest decided to bail on the job, were they fired??? What were the consequences for them?", "The evidence would suggest otherwise", "The entire thesis of this post is that you ARE this bad at remembering shit and you have no ability to be dependable at all, you fucking nitwit.", "So the dinner was on the actual day of her 18th birthday and you expected her to do nothing to celebrate it just because you couldn\u2019t be there?", "So your big apology/make up dinner for missing her graduation was to celebrate her birthday??? Do you not normally celebrate her birthday?\n\nI still don't get how you are mad at your daughter for still continuing with the plan even though you bailed on her, for plans you made to make up missing her graduation on her birthday.  She is still willing to meet up with you and you want to ditch her again? \n\nAlso, why the hell would your current wife be mad about you going to your daughter's graduation? I would love to hear that reasoning, if it's true, shes TA too!", "Ever heard the saying \"Want in one hand, shit in the other?\"\n\nI'd be stocking up on toilet paper, you'll probably need it with this guy.", "He didn't screw himself over, he screwed his daughter over....again.", "I would love to have some of whatever you are smoking dude.", "I\u2019ll share :)"]}
