Check all laptops.computers:phones/tablets for spyware.", "Silver lining: \n\n>He apparently told the guy I was MTF transgender (I am not, but I am an ally) and the guy got uncomfortable and blocked me ever since\n\nYou dodged a bullet there", "NTA If being homeless is what happens when you fafo, so be it. \n\nYou need to tell yourself that you owe this guy *nothing,* and you need to believe it. You dont owe him a minute, a penny, or a thought. He's only back because he has you tagged as a sucker.\n\nYou mention being an ally. Every time you weaken, go look up some trans stats for just about anything, but especially what happens when people are outed. Its not your job to be a buffer zone from his karma", "NTA.  Not paying rent was 100% enough reason to kick him out.  The last straw was just icing on the shit cake.  NTA for letting him stay homeless.", "NTA, he did this to himself. He doesn't pay rent, messy, makes inappropriate comments to you even after you told him to stop and sabotaged a relationship because he was jealous that you were seeing someone. If you let him come back he will likely escalate. He was absolutely trying to get into your pants and if he's come back after 5 months, it's probably because no one else wants his creepy ass either. If he keeps coming back see if you can get him tresspassed from the property.", "Is it just me, or do you get total Nice Guys (tm) vibes from the guy?  That he somehow decided she would be his girlfriend.  Then got real jealous when she found a potential date.  And sabotaged her.\n\nShe should let him stay homeless.  And read the niceguys sub to see what guys like him can do.", "He didn't \"violate a boundary.\" He committed a felony; the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act makes it illegal to access an Internet connected computing device in excess of your authorization.", "NTA - this jerk has no respect for anyone, HE BROKE INTO YOUR PHONE! If you let him back in, you will be the AH to yourself. The poor decisions made and wrong paths he has taken are not your problem. He\u2019s probably homeless AGAIN because of bridges he\u2019s burned. You sound like a nice person and he\u2019s the type to take advantage of that. Please do not let him back in!", "Yeah NTA and I hope you have changed the locks! Tell  current roomies/ neighbors  to be on the lookout  for this dude and get a restraining order if you can. And speaking gently, next time please trust your gut about  not letting creeps into your life on ANY  level . I know its hard when you need cash for rent Ive been there but it is never worth it to live with a creeper. The age gap and the flirty jokes were a dealbreaker for him ever moving in in the first place.", "Obviously NTA but to your comment, I mean, from a tenancy standpoint legally it might be?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

He was mad his hot roommate wouldn't date him.", "Authorized access to her phone is probably a crime. Yes, the rent is a civil case but the phone thing I guess can be a crime in several jurisdictions", "He stopped paying rent for months. A court would have evicted him and ordered him to pay what he owes. How is him being homeless the OP's responsibility?", "It's ... really optimistic to think the cops and the state prosecutor are going to care that someone temporarily took someone's phone and ruined a date.  But good luck with that.", "Again, from a legal tenancy standpoint, you are incorrect.  You can\u2019t just throw someone out if they stop paying rent without following the specific eviction process for that area.  I\u2019m not trying to be an asshole here but I\u2019m right.   It sucks.", "That's what she knows of.  He was probably looking for nudes.", "Even if he was, and found some, and posted them on RevengePorn.com, and revenge porn was illegal in OP's jurisdiction ... good luck.  My cold black cynical heart that has never had a productive interaction with the police can only wish you good luck.", "let the asshole be homeless.", "Consider this it would be a really funny prank if he was homeless NTA", "No way. Do not let him in. He's a classic user. If you lt him he will use you up.", "NTA.", "Girl no, don\u2019t let this man move back in. He is 10 years older than you and a complete AH. He is not your problem and needs to take care of himself. NTA", "let his ass be homeless. so be it.", "NTA", "NTA.  His homelessness is his problem to solve.  You don't take in a roommate that you know you can't trust!  Who knows what other stuff he'd do?  He's messy, rude, didn't pay rent consistently, inappropriate and got on your phone to look through your messages and then lied to that guy.  Tell him if he shows up at your door again you'll consider getting a restraining order.", "NTA  Do not let him set one foot in your house.  He already owes you back rent.

You're NTA NTA NTA\n\nJust make sure you're protected and that he has no means of access to your home, get cameras and all", "NTA\n\nThe homeless problem is self inflicted, he just needs to rent some place else, telling your BF that you were a male when you were born female and still are is a major issue on trust", "He\u2019s weird as fuck. You need to protect yourself. Hopefully your locks have changed, have cameras etc. don\u2019t feel bad, he did it to himself!!!! NTA", "NTA AT ALL!! Do not let him back in your home ever again", "NTA - this person is a leech", "NTA.  He made his own bed by being a complete AH.  If he has no other friends, ask yourself why that might be.  And honestly, ask yourself why you're even thinking about letting him back in.", "NTA.  I would've kicked him out a lot sooner!     He got his own self kicked out by his behavior,  you're not responsible for his living situation.", "NTA, that wasn't his concern when he sabotaged your relationship. People don't think of what it could cost them when they are being AH, and now he wants it to be your problem that he has no place to live. If you allowed him to come back, there is no telling what he would do to sabotage any future relationships. He is not trustworthy in any form, and he will probably continue to try and get you to foot his living expenses. \n\nDon't fall for his sob story or you may regret it, and it might be harder to get rid of him.", "NTA anyone who is that disrespectful of boundaries is liable to do anything imo. Wouldnt trust him with a 10 ft pole.", "OP, you got him out \"easily\" last time. If he sets foot in your house again, I guarantee he'll get squatters rights and make it impossible to get him out. I would tell him if he comes back you'll call the police for harassment. I'd also get security cameras and make sure you changed the lock.", "Doesn't matter if it would be a crime in her area anyway. Even if they wanted to prosecute, unlocking someone's phone and sending a text isn't a super easy thing to trace back to a specific person. Civil cases are almost twice as easy to win as criminal cases. Pressing charges over a text message wouldn't be worth it. The evidence likely won't come within a mile of \"beyond reasonable doubt.\" All she'd be doing is taking time out of her own life for the sake of trying (and likely failing) to get revenge on someone for ruining a date. A date with a guy who likely wouldn't work out if she's an ally of the trans community, since the sheer mention caused him to block her without so much as a conversation or a \"let's be friends.\"\n\nJustice is important. But when there's next to no chance of winning, the losses were minimal at best, and it's going to cause you extra stress revolving around someone you want out of your life? Probably not worth it. Especially not when karma's doing more than any day in court ever would.\n\nQuick PSA, though. When you're looking for roommates and you meet someone rude, obnoxious, messy and inappropriate...maybe keep up the roommate search? Obviously OP didn't realize it would get worse, but think of it this way. That asshole you're meeting is interviewing to be your roommate. This may very well be what it looks like when they're making their BEST impression. You might think you can settle and live with their chaos today, but there's a high risk it'll be much worse tomorrow.", "It's five months later."]}
