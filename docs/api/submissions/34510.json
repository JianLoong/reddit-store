I will not name my roommate out of the very little respect I still have for him, but in all honesty I wanted to kick him out even before this all happened; and, this was my final straw.   \n\n\nFor some background, I had an ad up on Craigslist in 2020 looking for a roommate because at the time I was much lower on money. He ended up applying and we met and had our arrangements sorted so that we were housed together. I didn't really like his personality but I kept it relatively to myself because of my financial situation. He was messy, almost never cleaned up after himself, he was really rude and inappropriate (making odd flirtatious comments about me even after I rebuffed his advances, but he called it all a \"joke\") to put it simply.\n\n  \nAll was normal until about 3 years after he moved in (Early-mid 2023) he suddenly stopped paying his part of the rent and had a different excuse every time, mostly things like \"I'm looking for a job!\" and such. I let it slide because I was a bit more financially stable (even though he was setting me back quite a bit). But then months had passed, and he had the same excuses and I grew tired of him. Like I said, I did plan on kicking him out regardless, but the next situation was the last straw.  \n\n\nAt the time, I was seeing some guy for a while and had a date. I really, really liked him. I was stoked, and I mentioned it once to my roommate. This was a big mistake. Behind my back while I was in the shower, my roommate somehow got the passcode to my phone correctly and WENT THROUGH IT. I don't know if he saw the texts or was planning it anyway, but he completely sabotaged my relationship with the guy I was seeing and thought it was SO hilarious.  \n\n\nHe apparently told the guy I was MTF transgender (I am not, but I am an ally) and the guy got uncomfortable and blocked me ever since. Not only did I find it absolutely disgusting that he used the LGBT as the butt of his joke, I was absolutely furious that he crossed my boundary this much because of his own jealousy. I blew up on him and kicked him out, and ever since then he has been gone, and I cut all contact.  \n\n\nThat was 5 months ago. A couple days ago, he has shown up at my doorstep with an apology. I personally do not accept this apology because what he did was utterly inexcusable, in my opinion, but he is trying to tell me he has no family, nowhere else to go, and if I don't let him stay, he will be homeless.   \nI do not plan on letting him back in with me, but I think I may be an asshole for letting him stay homeless.", "created_utc": 1704617351, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190nxcq/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_roommate_come_back/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
