It doesn't really matter if Eli is getting fewer chores (and Sasha is getting easier ones, TBH), it's that you're making your 12 year old do an I'm-prepping-for-guests level of cleaning every single day.", "I'm going to go against the grain here and say YTA for having another kid when you knew that would add more work on your other kids.", "Having a child with a disability is a very hard thing to figure out how far to push the child. I have an adult child with a disability and I completely understand. You need to set him up for success,  which means not telling him what he can't do. I bet Eli can sweep the floor,  but it will be done in a different way. He may struggle at first,  but I bet he will figure out a way to do it.", "I will actually go with YTA, not because you give them chores, but because you dont split them up evenly and give them the same allowance although the 12 year old has completly others need than a 9 year old and she also does way harder and longer lasting tasks. \n\nHow can take the dogs for a walk only  take 5-10 mins? That seams way to short, and as far as i know you should go out 2-3 times a day with dogs, or do you have a yard? Also vacuuming and sweeping is sth that takes really long, esp if you have to do it every day? In comparison to that folding some pieces of laundry and watering some plants which are really easy tasks. Also Sasha seems to have it easy, taking out garbage can be done when he laves the house, making beds? What does that even mean - do your and your other children dont make their bed? And yeah doing the dishes can take some time but i think it is still way shorter than having to walk the dogs, but yeah i depends on how extravagant your cooking is, but is also only supper.", "INFO: Aside from the chores, does your eldest daughter take on extra responsibilities to help out with her brother? It may not be about the chores. Other responsibilities for her siblings might be putting pressure on her and she may just be feeling overwhelmed. \n\nThat being said, your brother was completely out of line, and it seems like you're doing what you think works best for your household/kids.", "Dinner dishes for a family of five takes 5 minutes? Seems a bit much, and why vacuum every day?", "Maybe give allowances based on age? Same chores, but on a sliding pay scale for their ages. Ali will earn slightly more because she's older etc and maybe will feel more valuable? You don't need to tell them it's aged based", "YTA, it is ridiculous that you're having them do a lot of these tasks every single day. Kids only have so many hours of time to themselves outside of school and homework, taking that time so that your house is sparkling is ridiculous. Your house doesn't need to be sparkling, it's not Buckingham Palace.\n\nI don't think the uncle is coming from a completely right place cuz he's not coming from respect to you at all, I do think you are treating your daughter's unfairly by diminishing the value of their labor by having them do more than their brother, and then compensating them the same. There are always going to be limitations, and yes your son can't do some of those chores, but he is doing lighter labor, and it is unfair to your daughters that they have to do all of these other chores entirely because you and Eli aren't doing them, but that's just the expectation.", "Yeahhh kinda the AH. You admit that you put more on the kids as a result of having a 4th(?) child, the 3rd of which has some major physical disabilities. It may sound as though Allie is being combative against Eli, but are you sure that\u2019s the case? Not only is she being forced to do more work than she used to(even if it is easy work, as you claim), but also is doing more than her other sibling for the same take home. You, like it or not, told her when she opened up to you that she doesn\u2019t have the right to be upset by that, which is why she went to her uncle. Talk to your kids (and brother if they have a tendency to go to him) and see if there\u2019s more to it. Older kids and siblings with disabled siblings can go through a lot of stuff that\u2019s ignored thanks to the parents focusing on the new kid/ disabled kid. It\u2019s obvious that there\u2019s some equality/equity/fairness issues that are unresolved in your family. Just talk with your family.", "INFO: do any of the fathers contribute or is it just your older daughters?", "Unrelated, but please don't ask your kid to water plants every day. Every week is best for most. Every two for succulents.", "Let\u2019s refocus your question because I think you know you\u2019re out of line when it comes to the amount of chores your (quite young) children are responsible for, and are deliberately attempting to focus the attention on just your special-needs son. I appreciate that your brother is a jerk and should not have commented on this situation to your child. However: your two girls are doing too many chores. They are children, and between the two of them they have more household responsibilities than many adults. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard being in this situation, and I\u2019m not going to call you an AH, but you NEED to take a look at your household situation and make some changes, because these kids aren\u2019t just doing typical chores, they are your personal maids. That\u2019s heartbreaking.", "NTA. For those who are basically saying you're a bad mom for making them do chores...good God. They have plenty of time to socialize and study and fit in 15-30 minutes a day of contributing to the household. And they get paid? Amazing. \nLesson to teach your kids because everyone needs to know this: FAIR DOES NOT MEAN EQUAL. Some people have different needs. Evening up the playing field is not showing favoritism and your daughters need a lesson in empathy. If Eli had the same amount of chores but took twice as long to complete because of his challenges, how is that fair? It's not fair they can run and walk and have full use of their limbs. They need a change in perspective. Should they not be allowed to use their left arms cause Eli can't? If you go to dinner with friends and only get a salad, should your fair share be equal to someone who had lobster and 3 drinks? I repeat: fair does not mean equal.", "NTA, I feel like these chores seem age appropriate and not like too much. Maybe Allie and Sasha could rotate their chores once a week or something? Like in my head, vacuuming is way easier than doing the dishes, even though they take the same amount of time. If I was a kid and I ALWAYS had to do the dishes instead of a chore that I saw as \u201ceasier\u201d I would think it wasn\u2019t fair. Just as an example! Maybe some variety would help. \n\nUltimately Allie and Sasha need to understand that if Eli\u2019s mobility is limited that means he isn\u2019t currently able to do all of the same chores as them. That\u2019s not a bad thing, it\u2019s part of being part of a household. I was always told that allowances are a privilege, not a right. We all contributed to the house and were rewarded with that privilege.", "Like assuming all their chores take the same amount of time, like 20-30 minutes, it seems fair to me. Most jobs pay by the hour, not by amount of work done. \n\nMaybe if Allie wants to make extra money, offer her extra chores? Or she could go mow lawns? Or you could just not have allowance be tied to chores. I did chores growing up without any allowance, it's just what we were expected to do.\n\nNAH I think the kids are just young and don't understand that life isn't always 100% fair, and just because Eli is doing less chores doesn't mean he's not putting in the same effort. That's something they'll have to learn. Tattling to the uncle is kinda a weird move on Allie's part, tho.\n\nAlso I also don't think that's an excessive amount of chores. If you're vacuuming and sweeping daily, it's going to take way less time than if you do it every week and it builds up. Kids should have daily chores, it teaches responsibility, and 30 min is fine for those ages.", "(1.) These chores are everyday? Even the vacuuming??? Who vacuums every single day? And with a baby in the house too, doesn't the sound disturb them?  Yes, if you give some of them more chores than the others you ought to compensate them properly for it. \n(2.) Something that might be a better solution is rather than assigning specific chores to each child, make a list of individual chores with the allowance amount that would be paid for it if the kid does it. Let the kids pick from the list based on what they want each week, with a rule of needing to pick at least one, but additional chores being optional if they want more allowance. Let Eli have first pick since they won't be able to do certain chores without difficulty, so they're guaranteed to get one they can do. Anything that doesn't get picked you ought to do instead. If you notice certain chores not getting picked ever, and want to encourage the kids to do those to help, then consider increasing the allowance for that specific chore.", "NTA, you are teaching your kids to help out.   Mine do 30 min a day of chores with me.  They are 7.  One has special needs and does about half what his twin brother does in the same time.  They both work for 30 min.   Fair does not alway make it the same.  Your doing fine. Your brother needs to butt out. And your kids should be happy they only have 10 min a day of housework.", "Yta turns out a walk around the block can take 5 minutes or ten depending how often the dogs go which appearantly theres 2 so probably longer. Vacuuming could take longer depending how big the house is considering theres 5 people. Most of them are children. I'm willing to be 30 minutes ro an hour. Who watches the kids when you work? Especially since there's a baby and a disabled child. I see more red flags here then your saying. I'm willing to bet because of the baby and the disabled son they domt socialize much on top of the chores. SHE A SINGLE PARENT SO THE CARE PROBABLY FALLS MOSTLY ON THE OLDEST KID. This is gonna get worst on them. Yes you should pay the able bodied ones that are doing more then the disabled one.\n\n\n\nIn your edit about them taking 5 to 10 minutes I'm calling bs. \n\n\nNothing wrong with chores but she's leaving a lot out.", "NTA there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with having children do chores as long as there\u2019s a balance in their lives", "Info: how many times a day is she taking the dogs out", "NTA - Eli has a physical disability, you are the mother and determine what everyone is capable of. Your daughters need to understand that life is not going to be fair and it isn't like you are giving Eli no chores. Your brother is TA though, this is none of his business.", "NTA. This is how you teach your children that fairness means equity rather than equality.", "Who vacuums daily?!", "YTA - You claim the chores max out at 5-10 minutes, either you are way underreporting or your dogs are stuck in a supposedly quite small duplex for all but 5 minutes a day? \n\nAlso you aren\u2019t an AH for making the kids do chores, but they should have an equal split otherwise they will just resent each other.", "YTA\n\nThose saying this is to teach equity not equality are off. You give age-appropriate and task-appropriate allowances. What I would think fair would be:\n\nAllie- walk dogs + vacuum - allowance x\n\nSasha - wash supper dishes + take garbage out + sweep kitchen (everyone make their own beds!) - allowance x \n \nEli - water plants + fold laundry (stop taking on volunteer laundry until YOU have time do it yourself) - allowance y. He can get allowance x when he's a bit older like his sister with a few added appropriate tasks\n\nInfo: are Allie and Sasha tasked with any care duties for Eli?\n\nAnd I refrain from commenting about having another kid after knowing you need to care for a special needs child.", "YTA. \n\nWhile I understand that physically he can't do more, you also are giving him the same amount of money to do less work.  Of course they are pissed off about that.  If he has 3 chores and the rest have 5, he should get 60% of what they get", "The chores don't sound unfair to me. None of them would realistically take more than 20 minutes out of the day. NTA.", "Nta. As long as their chores are reasonable length of time and take about the same amount, I don't see a problem. I would make sure the chores aren't too time consuming.  Also, vacuuming an entire house every day is a lot, and probably not needed daily. Some of those chores don't seem like they needed to be done daily.  And every kid should make their own bed... But that's my personal opinion. I would discuss equity vs equality. It's pretty normal for a 10 year old to be focused on equality.", "YTA.\n\nThis is not about who's getting more allowance and doing less chores. This is about you having 4 children and you have turned most of them into your personal maids. Do you do anything around the house? Why do you keep having kids if you can't keep up with chores? And you just keep dumping more work on them.", "OMG what is with these Y and the Ts and the as, are kids nowadays getting terrorized by 5 to 10 minutes of vacuuming? Hell even without prompting I helped far more chores for my single mother or my grandparents without pay since I was 5 or 6 (mind you at that age it wasn't that much I could help with, like carrying a grocery bag in, throw small bag of trash away, etc). I understand the feeling of the child feeling unfair about the equal amount of work but she does need to understand her sibling can only do so much. NTA.", "NTA for the thing you're asking about. You need to teach your eldest that disability is work just to live with, or at least find a way to make this feel less unfair for her. Probably by doing what most have suggested and working your kids less.\n\nBut you are the AH for working your kids so goddamn hard. The chores themselves are fine, but every day? Especially in  what you have identified as a very small home. They're kids let them have their childhood. Way too much.", "YTA.

My brother and I had chores when we were kids, but weren\u2019t responsible for cleaning the entire house the way your kids seem to be.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for not making Eli do chores he is physically incapable of doing. That\u2019s the only thing you\u2019re N T A for, though.", "Honestly YTA for having all these kids", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain here and say YTA. Allie is right that you are being unfair, it\u2019s completely fine that you don\u2019t make Eli do as difficult of chores because he is disabled, that can\u2019t be helped, but you can give Allie and Sasha more money to make things fair. Allie, and to a lesser extent Sasha by the description of the chores, both do more chores and more physically exerting chores, and they deserve to be rewarded for that. You should treat your children with equity, not equality.", "YTA\n\nIf the disabled child is getting the same amount of money for doing less chores, then yeah you are wrong and the children see that. \n\nLess work, should equal less pay.  It is neither fair or teaching them a good lesson and what you are teaching them is not something you are wanting them to learn.", "NTA Your brother needs to mind his own business. You are their Mom and what you say is law and you don't need him undermining you.", "NTA - your brother has no idea what he\u2019s talking about. First off kids needs to understand that the world isn\u2019t fair never was never will be. To teach anyone the world is fair is misguided and plain old wrong. \n\nAll these decisions are the parents to make and nobody else gets a vote and frankly your child was a bit of an asshole by trying to get your brother to intervene but you know that. Unfortunately 12 year old girls start to figure out who they are as people and this can be quite stressful for everyone in blast range but thankfully it\u2019s usually finished detonating by about 16 it\u2019s usually then you\u2019ve completed the character building processes.

Bigger trash can? Paper products one day a week? Maybe Wednesdays are a no chore day? Instead of pushing everything to them, you might want to think of some solutions you\u2019d come up with if it was just you and the baby (keeping the original chores is fine). I think sometimes as adults we forget that kids have really long busy days during the school year. I know I personally don\u2019t feel like doing much when I get home from work and there are many days there is laundry in the dryer, dishes by the sink, trash overflowing. My family size is smaller but we\u2019re not doing those tasks everyday ever. I think it\u2019s one thing to want them to learn responsibility by doing chores and it\u2019s another to add an additional child and ask them to pick up the slack on top of what they were already doing.

I do understand Allie\u2019s frustration but think you\u2019re right not overloading Eli. Growing up, my parents gave my brother a little more money than me in our weekly allowance because he\u2019s three years older and did more than me. Maybe giving different pay for the amount of work they do would be a good idea though.", "I'd say YTA not for the chores, but for giving a child who does the least the same allowance as the ones who do more.", "NTA - These chores are not exhaustive and if they are only taking such a short amount of time AND they get an allowance then there is no harm here.

If the younger ones are doing less intensive jobs because they\u2019re younger, they should then get less allowance. \n\nMy parents always paid us $1 per year of age. So I would get $12 at 12yrs because I was doing more intensive jobs than my 6yo brother was (earning $6). We were each personally responsible for making our beds though.\n\nAlso, the work associated with volunteering shouldn\u2019t count towards someone\u2019s chores, it should be in addition to their fair share of jobs. So naturally, those volunteering should have more jobs than those not.", "OP, I understand that it's not an easy situation you're in, but it's not sustainable long-term, so what are you going to do to decrease the general workload in the house? Get rid of your pets maybe? Just... 4 children and 2 pets for a single mother is a lot. And please don't have any more children.", "Yta\n\nI agree with the children they should all get the same amount for their chores, who ever does more chores should get more chore money. \nHowever, if you would like to make it fair then explain to them that Eli gets a disability allowance. This will help explain to the kids why he doesn't have to do chores but still gets money.

But except for my first point I guess it's absolutely fine.\n1. Their allowance definitely should be adjusted to their age and shouldn't be directly tied to doing chores. Providing an age-appropriate allowance is your responsibility, doing a few chores is theirs, but it isn't a transaction. A small, equal additional tip showing your appreciation of their work would be fine imo.\n2. It's great that you make them do chores but it seems a bit excessive. Unless your dogs shed an ungodly amount, cleaning the house daily is absurd. Also it might be worth looking into bigger trash cans so you don't have to do daily garbage runs.\n3.

Maybe that could be a more fair way to do things. \n\nFor the record though, YTA for having another baby when you\u2019re clearly already overextended. Kids don\u2019t get to choose their parents, but adults get to choose who they are and how they treat the children they decided to bring into the world. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your older kids cut you off and ran for the hills the second they turn 18.", "Are you kidding me? You\u2019re telling me that vacuuming and sweeping are too much of a chore for a 12 year old? When I was 12 years old, I was cleaning the kitchen every day as well as sweeping and dusting, and that\u2019s not including cleaning a shared bathroom, picking up dog poop, keeping my room clean, and mopping when needed. Plus normal kid stuff like playing, reading, and homework! This is not an excessive amount of chores for a 12 year old, and they are not difficult tasks, especially if you do them daily. Sweeping, mopping, dusting, and vacuuming are all chores that take max 5 to 10 minutes, even in a larger home if they are maintained regularly, even if you have pets like OP says she does. It is unreasonable to assume that a 12-year-old should sit around all day and not help out the family at all. They are getting paid to do this! I didn\u2019t even get an allowance, they are very lucky. \n\nPlus, all the comments criticizing OP for having another child when she has one in a wheelchair are so ableist and rude. It would be ableist of her to stop her life and coddle her disabled child. If he struggles with movement and can only water the plants and fold laundry (harder to do in a wheelchair due to movement constraints.. oh, and also he apparently has limited function in one of his hands!!) then it is a fair distribution of chores! You wouldn\u2019t expect him to sweep or take out the garbage, but he is contributing equally in effort, which is what is important when it comes to foundational skills such as chores. Doing even a part of a chore is better than not doing it at all, and as he ages he will likely learn more skills and be able to access more things. \n\nI would recommend that, if your son is comfortable, your daughter attempts to do his chores like he does, and even try to do hers. Make her sit in a chair and (once again IF ELI IS COMFORTABLE) attempt to replicate the type of movement difficulties he has in his hand. Then, make her water the plants and attempt to fold the laundry. She will see how difficult it is, and if she doesn\u2019t, hand her a broom and make her butt-scoot around with the broom trying to sweep.

They all should be able to make their own beds, including Eli. I don't understand why folding laundry is a chore. I would think each kids laundry would be it's own load, and the kids would fold their own laundry. Allie is definitely working the hardest. She should be paid more for doing more work. Taking the garbage out and doing dishes are okay chores, but the beds make no sense and aren't equal to the work Allie is doing. Eli's chores sound like you're just giving him some uneeded chores to make him feel better. I can see why Allie is annoyed. I can easily see her feeling like her hard work is being undervalued.

Maybe he's responsible for picking up miscellaneous items around the house and putting them back where they go?

Everyone has to make their own bed, everyone has to complete one mandatory chore per day each, and then the rest of the chores they can earn money for, as in, there\u2019s a list of chores and a $$ amount attached, and if someone wants to do all the chores well that person gets all the $$ (that\u2019s just an idea - do what works for you). You could also add more to the list of things they can earn money for as well - put laundry on, wipe down surfaces, tidy common areas, make breakfast for the oldest 3 kids - whatever else you think they\u2019re capable of and needs doing around the house. \n\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to have everyone pitch in to help, and they can learn the hard way that no work = no spending money.

But a conversation with the kids definitely needs to happen and perhaps coming to a compromise of the older children getting a \u201craise\u201d. \nChildren need age appropriate chores, none of the chores you listed seem to go against that. As for Eli, he has a physical disability that prevents him from doing certain chores, you can\u2019t expect him to just \u201cwork harder\u201d. He still has chores that are appropriate to his abilities. In education we call this making modifications, he is still expected to do work but it will look different that his peers. You need to explain the difference between Equality and Equity to you children, you\u2019re 12 year old should be able to grasp the difference if explained well. \nBut what I will agree with the children here is the allowance. Older kids should be making more than the younger kid. They\u2019ve been doing chores longer, hence \u201cseniority\u201d, and their age appropriate chores may be more demanding and should be compensated as such. Again, equity not equality.

However, you should reevaluate how you\u2019re handling this situation going forward. I would encourage you to take this as an opportunity to teach Allie about knowing her worth and negotiating pay. If she wants a raise because she feels the work she is doing is worth more, she should be encouraged to ask for that instead of asking for more work or a pay cut for her sibling. I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be fair to decrease Eli\u2019s allowance or assign him more chores if he\u2019s not physically capable of them and Allie should learn the difference between what is fair and what is equitable.

The point in doing chores isn\u2019t to make money, but develop good with ethic and sense of responsibility. \n\nI would even argue it sets a bad example if you were to give in and pay your less-able child less money because you\u2019re then punishing the younger one (by reducing allowance) and rewarding the older child by increasing the allowance disparity without having done additional work. \n\nCould be a good opportunity to teach that you move ahead in life by taking initiative and working to the best of your ABILITY and not worrying about others around you", "That's a pretty mild chore list.  When you have pets, you have to sweep daily. Dishes have to get done daily. Pets have to go out and garbage cans need to be emptied. Laundry has to be done or there are no clean clothes to wear.

And that's not what she's asking judgment for anyway, it's her daughter's perception of the fairness of the chores. Which seem very reasonable for their ages. So, NAH.\n\nMy family had a different approach. There were 3 kids. We had a tally board of daily and once a week chores. Each given a dollar amount. It was based on length of time and difficulty of the task. Ex. Take out trash: $1. Dishes: $2. Clean guinea pig pen: $5.\nWe had most of the day to complete the chores and mark off the board. At 6, the kid that had done the most chores got to relax, while the other 2 did the remaining chores but had trade off to choose them. At the end of the week, the numbers would get tallied, and we would get the money as allowance.\nThere was almost never any argument about fairness, because you got paid for what you did. And the tougher chores paid more, so they were the ones we really wanted to do. I think in hindsight it was a really good system, and rewarded initiative.\n\nETA: BTW, 2 of those 3 kids were BC failures due to health issues and defective product.

You treat your kids as staff, not as your children. And they went and complained to another adult (their uncle) because apparently you don't listen to them.\n\nVacuuming the whole house, taking the dogs out and sweeping the entryway will take a 12 year old at least an hour per day, probably longer, if the dogs are taken on a proper walk. 5 minutes is not enough. Dogs need the stimulation of the outdoor environment. They are living creatures with needs, and if you can't cater to these needs, you shouldn't have a dog in the first place.

The division of labor isn't as fair as you make it out to be. Maybe have an open dialogue with all three kids and get their opinions on the division of labor.\n\nAlso, vacuuming every single day isn't necessary unless everyone is coming in covered in mud. I grew up with an abusive mother who expected what was pretty much a deep clean of the house every day once we were old enough to walk. As an adult, vacuuming once maybe twice a week is fine if you spot clean well.\n\nEdit: Also, everyone besides Eli and the 4 month old can make their own beds. That along with laundry is a chore they can do on their own and learn self-regulation and autonomy. Increasing the chore load due to your choice to have another kid is also a great way for them to resent the new baby and Eli. \n\nYou need to dial it back a bit. Talk with your kids and stop giving edicts from on high. Being part of a family means patience, understanding, compromise, and above all communication. Instead of squashing down any \"sign of resistance\" from your family unit members and teaching them that voicing their feelings and frustrations is wrong and will be ignored and punished; you could do with bucking up and being a parent to the three kids you decided to have. Don't create resentment and a \"parents vs kids\" mentality.

You say that it only takes 5-10 minutes a day. Well, I don't see how anyone could do those tasks that fast.\n\nThe real thing for me is that it has been proven that older siblings often have to take on much responsibility for their little siblings, especially when disabilities and living with a single parent comes into play. This can lead to way to much pressure on the shoulders of a literal child - that's what a 12 year old ist, even if she seems quite grown up.\n\nI also believe this issue could have been resolved if you chose to hear her out and think of her perspective.

Plus normal kid stuff like playing, reading, and homework! This is not an excessive amount of chores for a 12 year old, and they are not difficult tasks, especially if you do them daily. Sweeping, mopping, dusting, and vacuuming are all chores that take max 5 to 10 minutes, even in a larger home if they are maintained regularly, even if you have pets like OP says she does. It is unreasonable to assume that a 12-year-old should sit around all day and not help out the family at all. They are getting paid to do this!

It would be ableist of her to stop her life and coddle her disabled child. If he struggles with movement and can only water the plants and fold laundry (harder to do in a wheelchair due to movement constraints.. oh, and also he apparently has limited function in one of his hands!!) then it is a fair distribution of chores! You wouldn\u2019t expect him to sweep or take out the garbage, but he is contributing equally in effort, which is what is important when it comes to foundational skills such as chores. Doing even a part of a chore is better than not doing it at all, and as he ages he will likely learn more skills and be able to access more things. \n\nI would recommend that, if your son is comfortable, your daughter attempts to do his chores like he does, and even try to do hers. Make her sit in a chair and (once again IF ELI IS COMFORTABLE) attempt to replicate the type of movement difficulties he has in his hand. Then, make her water the plants and attempt to fold the laundry.

In the equitability panel, the tall person has no stool, the average height person has a small stool, and the short person has a taller stool. In this panel they can all see the game.

We use a wicking/breathable 100% wool insert & 100% linen duvet, then either cotton or linen fitted sheets & pillow cases. We don\u2019t use a top sheet anymore.

We do laundry every single day. Sometimes, it's even necessary to do more than one load a day to keep up. And I used to do all the dishes after dinner every day for years. One kid cleaned the table while I washed the dishes. It never seemed unfair or like I was doing more work than everyone else. And our house definitely needed to be cleaned every day, especially the entryway. My country is pretty rainy, so we would track lots of dirt in. I can't comment on making people's beds, since that's not a thing we did in my home, but everything else seems pretty reasonable to me, since that's pretty close to what my parents did and it never felt unfair then", "Exactly this, as a kid of that age, my chores were to help clean up after dinner (which everyone did together), making my bed, helping fold the laundry, and help with mopping/vacuuming, but the floor cleans and laundry were a once a week task, not an everyday one", "Honest to God in my house laundry is done every single day coz I'll do it all and the bloody baskets full again the next morning.

Plus, from having a long hair pup, even having someone do some big sloppy sweeping/vacuuming helps it not accumulate so even the \"big vacuum\" every week or two is not nearly so bad when you're moving furniture around.

It sounds like she's just trying to teach the children that everyone has to contribute to the family. I'd seriously sit Ali down and talk to her. Ask her how she'd feel doing her chores with one arm behind her back. Get up and show her how you can't sweep without two hands,  and/or would need different accommodations. But also and especially would it be fair if she got paid less to try to sweep with 1  arm! This is a parenting,  teachable moment,  and maybe OP is just a little busy managing the family with a practical newborn and can't really see the middle things til they're pointed out.
