{"id": 15403, "submission_id": "12uyro3", "title": "AITA for inviting my nephew and niece to stay with me at a nice hotel and treating them to fancy dinners, but not their older sister?", "selftext": "I (35M) recently went back to my hometown for a two-week stay. Mostly for work reasons but I also wanted to surprise my nephews and nieces cause I haven't been back in a few years.\n\nMy parents came from lower class backgrounds and worked hard to provide. I took advantage, finished school, moved abroad, and am now blessed to be in a position where money is not an issue. I'm single with no kids by choice, and make more than enough to live comfortably. I live modestly, though I have a large budget when it comes to travel, food, and socializing. \n\nMeanwhile my siblings are notoriously bad with money. My sister in particular always prioritizes wants over needs. She's always broke, no matter how much she earns. Her kids, suffered as a result, sometimes missing meals or have no running water at home cause my sister spent it all on I don't know what.\n\nBeing the cool uncle I am, I like to spoil my niblings when I visit. They're like the kids I don't have. We'd go to restaurants, theme parks, and other fun stuff they normally can't afford to do.\n\nI\u2019m cool with this. Quality food, nice hotels, and entertainment are all things I take for granted now, but it\u2019s the equivalent of a celebrity lifestyle to my niblings. It thrills me to let them experience it, and hopefully gives them the motivation to dream big.\n\nA day before my trip, I learned my nephew Dan (18M) had fought with his mom. Dan\u2019s a good kid, but my sister is toxic and verbally abusive. Anyway he left home and was staying with my uncle who lives in a tiny flat and whose bed is a thin mattress on the floor.\n\nIt didn\u2019t feel right that I had this suite at a posh hotel while my nephew was sleeping on the floor. I messaged him when I landed, and suggested he come stay with me. He could take the bedroom and I'd happily take the sofa bed.\n\nThen my niece, his twin Samantha (18F), messaged him asking where he was. I told Dan he could tell Sam he was with me (surprise!), and that she could even come over so we could have dinner together.\n\nAt dinner, Sam updated me on her life. She\u2019s a full-time student with a job, paying for her own way through uni. But she\u2019s mentally near breaking point and my sister is no help. Sam would often skip meals just so she had money to commute to work and school. At home, my sister is often yelling and screaming at someone, so it\u2019s difficult to focus on school work or relax on a rare day off.\n\nSam's school happens to be nearby, so I said she could also stay at the suite. It's quiet and she could even use the business lounge to study in peace. She and Dan would share the King bed.\n\nI scrapped my surprise idea and told my sister her kids were with me so she wouldn't worry.\n\n**Now here's where I might be an AH.**\n\nMy oldest adult niece is Bea (22F). She lives with her husband (currently away for work) and their 4yo son. When she found out that Dan and Sam were staying in a suite in a nice hotel, with a buffet breakfast every morning, and dinner at classy restaurants, she got jealous and started saying things like \"I see who uncle's favourite people are\" and \"nobody likes me since I had my baby.\"\n\nI said she could come and share the king bed if Sam and Dan were willing (they were). But I honestly didn't want to cause Bea would bring her kid and I'm not keen on sharing my space with a toddler. Also I use the suite to work when the lounge is full or closed. I'd book them a separate room if she really wanted, but the hotel's packed. Anyway, I'd be expected to compensate for transportation, food, and entertainment for her and her kid. This isn't gonna hurt me financially but I don't want to set a precedent where I'm expected to pay for the entire family tree during visits.\n\nBea left the family group chat and unfriended me after she saw pics Sam shared on Facebook. I've tried to be understanding, but it feels ridiculously petty.\n\nI never intended anyone to feel left out. I just wanted to help, but now there's conflict brewing between Bea and the twins. I don't know if I did the right thing, or if I'm an AH who could've handled this situation better.\n\nEdit: typos and edited sentences for clarity", "created_utc": 1682149739, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12uyro3/aita_for_inviting_my_nephew_and_niece_to_stay/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Huge difference between hosting teens for a few days and hosting an adult relative and her child. Bea is being both ridiculously petty and impractical.", "Hosting troubled teenagers trying to suss out their lives and survive is totally different than a jealous mom who wants some luxury. She may even need some luxury in her life, but she's not in any crisis from the narrative. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou helped your twin siblings because their situations weren't good and they couldn't afford to have even a decent place to sleep or work. There was no one providing for them and they were struggling to provide for themselves. \n\n\nBea's basically a single parent right now but she does have a husband who is working to provide already. I assume she has a comfortable and stable place currently? Regardless NTA", "Definitely NTA\n\nThe twins are two unmarried teens. \n\nShe is married with her own home to run and a toddler. She settled down young so she must behave like a mom and wife and not expect to still be treated like a teen niece. \n\nAlso, her comments about not being liked since she had a baby tells me she might be having personal issues about her life choices. Don't become a scape goat to that.", "NTA. It sounds like the oldest is being super childish and jealous.", "NTA. It\u2019s entirely reasonable not to want to share a space with toddlers.", "Bea is an adult with a husband and a kid why does she need her uncle to spoil her lmao\n\nNTA", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry she felt left out, but she is a married adult with a kid and her own home. She could have dropped in and had a nice lunch or dinner with you all, but it\u2019s wrong of her to expect the same treatment as the kids who are stuck in a crappy situation at home.  And honestly you gave them a break for a few days and some meals\u2026you didn\u2019t whisk them off for 6 months in Europe on your private yacht, her jealousy and reaction is a little extreme.", "You're NTA, but maybe try to understand her feelings. I think that the comment \"nobody likes me after I had a baby\" is telling you how she feels she is being treated (not by you but in general), and it's really not about the money. In this case this situation brought everything up to surface. \n\nI assume her mother's treatment wasn't better than it was for her younger siblings. And due to her circumstances, she probably has some issues and problems. You didn't do anything wrong, but maybe you should try and talk to her and ask her how life is going and see of she has anything on her mind. Maybe see if you can help her, not necessarily financially. People want to feel loved and cared for, that there is somebody out there still thinking of THEM. Her mother is problematic and now she's a (very young) mother herself. She's probably struggling on more ways than you think.", "NTA but your niece is the asshole.", "INFO: you came to town for two weeks and made a point to spend time with 2 of 3? you wined and dined 2 of 3. put 2 of 3 up in your posh suite. doted on 2 of 3. listened to their issues. showed them love. \n\nand you\u2019re confused why the left out one would be massively hurt? sounds like bea has an abusive mom, an uncle who doesn\u2019t care about her, and an absent husband. hopefully, she\u2019ll climb her way out. \n\nsmh. YTA", "I'll buck the trend and call YTA - but maybe for a different reason.\n\nRegarding the whole hotel thing - NTA.  As you properly note, you shouldn't be expected to provide room and board to your nibblings (didn't know that was a thing) while in town.\n\nBut where I think YTA happened is it sounds like you did NOTHING to engage with the oldest neice. You didn't reach out to her and let her know you were in town (she presumably found out via her siblings).  You apparently didn't make an effort to go visit her (and her child), meet them somewhere, or ask her to come see you.  In effect - and maybe unintentionally - but you proved her point about \"uncles favorites\".\n\nThis isn't even necessarily a money thing... She just felt excluded.  That could have easily been avoided by saying something like, \"hey, while I'm in town, I'd love to catch up with you.\" Or trying to coordinate getting all your nibblings together for an afternoon.\n\nBut if you didn't make that attempt, and then you think she's being petty, then I think you - maybe unintentionally - crossed the AH line.", "A full-grown adult married mother was upset she, and her husband, and her toddler weren't ALL invited to hang out because you decided to treat two barely not children to a good time?\n\nNTA.   \nShe must take after her mother. ;)", "NTA. \nYou did a lovely favour for the two youngest, who needed it. Bea sounds like an entitled brat.", "Clear NTA. Bea is an adult (and parent) who is acting like a jealous, spoiled, entitled child. Ignore the tantrum.", "NTA\n\nLooks like your sister is not the only one in the family who has trouble separating wants and needs.", "I think she shares living space with her husband's family. I don't think she gets along great with his parents.\n\nAnd I'm not sure where she's at financially but she doesn't have a job. She did ask for money once, so she can take her kid to the doctor. I hated saying no cause a kid's involved but that's her husband's responsibility.\n\nOverall she feels people stopped caring about her since she had her son, like not being included in conversations or outings anymore. Maybe she doesn't get that relationships can change once you move out, get married and have a kid. But it doesn't mean people don't care anymore.", "Yeah I definitely feel like she's having regrets having a kid young. No I'm not gonna fall for that cause I had multiple awkward talks with her about using protection since her mother is no use at all.", "she definitely made a mistake getting married and having a child so young", "Yeah you're right. I did tell her before she is welcome to talk to me anytime but she never did. Maybe cause I'm a guy? Maybe I should ask more? Not sure if I know how to do that without seeming too pushy, especially if she doesn't really want to talk to me.", "I laughed cause you put it so bluntly.\n\nAnd now I feel bad cause it's my niece and it seems to be the truth.", ">But where I think YTA happened is it sounds like you did NOTHING to engage with the oldest neice.

Similarly, he wouldn't have told niece about it either except she asked nephew where he was. \n\nWhile this was partially a social call visit, there is literally nothing to suggest he wouldn't have made plans to visit all of them outside this hotel shenanigan. He even says that he was excited to see and surprise his nephews and **nieces** (i.e. Sam **and Bea**). He just didn't invite her to the hotel initially, and after she found out he was gracious to enough to also let her stay with him (just not completely for free).", "full-grown adult. she\u2019s 4 years older than her siblings. and it\u2019s likely she got pregnant to get out of the abusive situation she was living in. but, yeah, bea\u2019s the worst. :/", "I think you probably could help her FAMILY in future - like the request for money for the kid, maybe the hubby is also struggling - but again there\u2019s a difference between helping an adult relative out (which she, as married mom absolutely qualifies as) and treating teens to a cool experience that\u2019s appropriate to their age.", "In the immediate situation described above, you are definitely NTA. However, it sounds like Bea went from one tough situation to another and was understandably jealous. If you have resources and care about her, try to support her in ways that help her specifically. Put a tiny bit of money aside for the kid each month? I balk at \"that's her husband's responsibility.\" That's a pretty harsh view of life. Just because she's married doesn't mean things are going well for her, or she wouldn't appreciate your support and love. That sentence sounds like its the 1950s.", "It's hard to know how to get someone to open up, but perhaps try to invite her to spend time together, if possible just her but if she isn't able to go without her baby invite them both. Building a relationship first to get the person to feel they CAN be open about themselves is more important than just asking \"hey you have anything you wanna talk about\". Spend time together, lunch, coffe, an activity or just to your house for dinner or whatever. It doesn't have to be anything fancy and big, but I really get the feeling that the comment \"nobody cares...\" shows it has nothing to do with the suite or her demanding/asking/expecting that she gets things for free. This was just the situation where she projected all of her feelings, whatever those are.\n\nBtw sorry for poor English!", "i think you may have more in common with your sister than you know", "Oh trust, I want to. And I did feel guilty after, even if the kid just had a little cold.\n\nBUT THEN I found out she, hubby, and kid went on a mini vacation a month later. And another week later I saw pics of them going out for beers. Didn't sit right with me.\n\nIf it's a life or death situation I wouldn't hesitate to help. But I don't want to be their emergency fund cause they don't wanna eat into their good time budget.", "wait!?! you didn\u2019t offer to help send her kid to the doctor. yikes. poor, bea. \n\neven my most absent uncle would never\u2026"]}
