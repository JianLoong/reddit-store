{"id": 15403, "submission_id": "12uyro3", "title": "AITA for inviting my nephew and niece to stay with me at a nice hotel and treating them to fancy dinners, but not their older sister?", "selftext": "I (35M) recently went back to my hometown for a two-week stay. Mostly for work reasons but I also wanted to surprise my nephews and nieces cause I haven't been back in a few years.\n\nMy parents came from lower class backgrounds and worked hard to provide. I took advantage, finished school, moved abroad, and am now blessed to be in a position where money is not an issue. I'm single with no kids by choice, and make more than enough to live comfortably. I live modestly, though I have a large budget when it comes to travel, food, and socializing. \n\nMeanwhile my siblings are notoriously bad with money. My sister in particular always prioritizes wants over needs. She's always broke, no matter how much she earns. Her kids, suffered as a result, sometimes missing meals or have no running water at home cause my sister spent it all on I don't know what.\n\nBeing the cool uncle I am, I like to spoil my niblings when I visit. They're like the kids I don't have. We'd go to restaurants, theme parks, and other fun stuff they normally can't afford to do.\n\nI\u2019m cool with this. Quality food, nice hotels, and entertainment are all things I take for granted now, but it\u2019s the equivalent of a celebrity lifestyle to my niblings. It thrills me to let them experience it, and hopefully gives them the motivation to dream big.\n\nA day before my trip, I learned my nephew Dan (18M) had fought with his mom. Dan\u2019s a good kid, but my sister is toxic and verbally abusive. Anyway he left home and was staying with my uncle who lives in a tiny flat and whose bed is a thin mattress on the floor.\n\nIt didn\u2019t feel right that I had this suite at a posh hotel while my nephew was sleeping on the floor. I messaged him when I landed, and suggested he come stay with me. He could take the bedroom and I'd happily take the sofa bed.\n\nThen my niece, his twin Samantha (18F), messaged him asking where he was. I told Dan he could tell Sam he was with me (surprise!), and that she could even come over so we could have dinner together.\n\nAt dinner, Sam updated me on her life. She\u2019s a full-time student with a job, paying for her own way through uni. But she\u2019s mentally near breaking point and my sister is no help. Sam would often skip meals just so she had money to commute to work and school. At home, my sister is often yelling and screaming at someone, so it\u2019s difficult to focus on school work or relax on a rare day off.\n\nSam's school happens to be nearby, so I said she could also stay at the suite. It's quiet and she could even use the business lounge to study in peace. She and Dan would share the King bed.\n\nI scrapped my surprise idea and told my sister her kids were with me so she wouldn't worry.\n\n**Now here's where I might be an AH.**\n\nMy oldest adult niece is Bea (22F). She lives with her husband (currently away for work) and their 4yo son. When she found out that Dan and Sam were staying in a suite in a nice hotel, with a buffet breakfast every morning, and dinner at classy restaurants, she got jealous and started saying things like \"I see who uncle's favourite people are\" and \"nobody likes me since I had my baby.\"\n\nI said she could come and share the king bed if Sam and Dan were willing (they were). But I honestly didn't want to cause Bea would bring her kid and I'm not keen on sharing my space with a toddler. Also I use the suite to work when the lounge is full or closed. I'd book them a separate room if she really wanted, but the hotel's packed. Anyway, I'd be expected to compensate for transportation, food, and entertainment for her and her kid. This isn't gonna hurt me financially but I don't want to set a precedent where I'm expected to pay for the entire family tree during visits.\n\nBea left the family group chat and unfriended me after she saw pics Sam shared on Facebook. I've tried to be understanding, but it feels ridiculously petty.\n\nI never intended anyone to feel left out. I just wanted to help, but now there's conflict brewing between Bea and the twins. I don't know if I did the right thing, or if I'm an AH who could've handled this situation better.\n\nEdit: typos and edited sentences for clarity\n\n~~~~~\n\nSome extra tidbits.\n\n\u2022 I have 6 cousins total. Bea, Sam and Dan, and 3 more between the ages of 3-16. All my sister's kids.\n\n\u2022 I'm primarily here for work, not leisure. I did extend my stay so I can visit my family next weekend and we'll all have a good time together then. Bea and her son included.\n\n\u2022 I'm not as wealthy as my post makes me out to be! Yeah I have a job that pays well but it's not like I'm driving around in a Bentley and live in a multi-million house. I get to enjoy the luxuries and extra spending money cause I keep things simple at home. I'm a Honda Civic, Kraft Dinner, and thriftstore deal hunter kinda guy. I choose to treat myself to good food and experiences instead. Combining my job's travel perks and my collection of loyalty cards makes it pretty easy to get room upgrades and splurge on some good eats, so I can also afford to help family. Got no kids, but I wanna leave some kinda legacy.", "created_utc": 1682149739, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12uyro3/aita_for_inviting_my_nephew_and_niece_to_stay/", "score": 689, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In this case this situation brought everything up to surface. \n\nI assume her mother's treatment wasn't better than it was for her younger siblings. And due to her circumstances, she probably has some issues and problems. You didn't do anything wrong, but maybe you should try and talk to her and ask her how life is going and see of she has anything on her mind. Maybe see if you can help her, not necessarily financially. People want to feel loved and cared for, that there is somebody out there still thinking of THEM.

Put a tiny bit of money aside for the kid each month? I balk at \"that's her husband's responsibility.\" That's a pretty harsh view of life.

You'll take some heat for letting the twins sleep in a king size bed but that's none of our business if they're good with it.  You're a good uncle to look out for your niece and nephew.", "NTA. You\u2019re nice. Not only would I not give it a second thought she wouldn\u2019t get another dime/gift from me after that behavior. She just played herself.", "NTA for all the reasons stated by other people here, but I am wondering something: you like to spoil them with luxuries which is fine I guess but you say you niece is \"mentally near breaking point\" from uni and work. Wouldn't your generosity be better spent on I don't know, help with tuition? Rent for a place for the twins so they can leave theit toxic mother?  I mean obviously you don't have to do anything but their mother is spending all money on useless things so help with actual useful stuff would make a bigger change no? Just my 2 cents.", "NTA - but feeling left out sucks. Maybe take her to dinner or lunch. Just her? If I did the math correctly she got pregnant at 17 just so she could escape. Or send her a gift just for her? I don't think it has to be huge or expensive. Even a manicure would be amazing.", "INFO: When Bea was the twins age, did you do anything like this for her?", "Nta", "NTA. It\u2019s weird that Bea got upset. She\u2019s an adult with a child and her own home.", "NTA In fact, maybe Bea should have offered her sibling(s) a place of respite when it got tough. You saw a situation and helped to resolve it. Take Bea for dinner, yes, but the need to entertain for entire stay is not necessary.", "NTA You\u2019re a damn good uncle. Bea is in an entirely different situation and is an adult. While you can\u2019t offer up the hotel to your other niece/nephew, it\u2019s just not the same for Bea as she has a child and the responsibilities of a parent. Expecting you to shoulder the cost and sharing a hotel with her and her child is just asking way too much.", "I'm here for work primarily, on the company's dime. But I did extend my stay so I can visit family next weekend. Maybe go to their favourite theme park and then have a nice dinner after.\n\nBea definitely had to help her siblings growing up. There's actually six of them in total, and the older kids took better care of each other than their own mother. After Bea moved out, it became Dan and Sam's role instead.\n\nI am helping Dan find his own place. Sam will be able to move in as well hopefully. But she's torn cause who will take care of the others?\n\nI give them all generous amounts of money every year, precisely so they don't need help paying for stuff like bus fares. Or (as in Bea's case) milk for her son. But I told them how they spend it is their responsibility cause I won't be giving them more. I want them to learn to be smart with their money.\n\nIn Sam's case, her mom (my sister) pressured her into giving up a good chunk to pay the internet bill. I gave Sam more money and told her to never loan money to my sister ever again. My sister has a full time job, and lives in my parent's house rent-free. She shouldn't need help paying the utility bills.", "If she does that, she's not getting the iPad Air she's been wanted for ages. /s\n\nThey don't know I got all of them gifts, and hers is the most expensive.\n\nEdit: Added /s for clarity.", "What did he do that was so wrong? He took in two teenagers who needed somewhere to stay vs. a grown woman with a husband, a kid and her own home. She didn\u2019t need help, she\u2019s just mad his help comes with great accommodations.", "Every year I send them all a pretty generous sum. They can use it as they like: save, spend, invest, whatever. BUT the rule is, I'm absolutely not giving them more than that until next year, so they gotta be smart about what they do with it. Guess I'm kinda trying to teach them the value of money.\n\nSam already used up most of her money. She made the mistake of loaning it to my sister to pay for the internet bill, so ofc she never saw it back.\n\nI did give in and gave her and Dan some extra cash, plus I've been buying her food for lunch.\n\nI am also helping Dan find a place. Sam wants to move out too but she's worried about the other kids (my three other niblings. I think they're 3, 7, 16 years old). My sister left the responsibility of raising her own kids to her older children, so Sam is reluctant to leave them.", "Oh she has a gift! I got her something she wanted for ages. But she doesn't know that and I haven't told her. It was supposed be part of the surprise when I go over next week.", "Last I saw Bea was when she was 17, before she had her kid. She and the twins got to stay in their own hotel room.\n\nI was also paying Bea's tuition cause her mom couldn't afford it and I reallt wanted her to finish high school.", "That's pretty much where I ended up too. I doubt things just suddenly changed for the twins. And 22 isn't long adult either.\n\nI think Bea is more feeling like the help came too late for her and could do more with acknowledgement than direct aid.", "I dont see where it even says she did run away. And right now she seems to be acting like her mom anyways, so who is to say she didnt like her home life as a teen. Or was possibly the golden child.\n\nI also dont see anything about Bea going to college or uni. If she didnt, she never exaclty needed this type of space.\n\nAnd besides all that: we dont know what OP was up to 3-4y ago. But OP sure sounds like the type of guy who wouldve been totally available to help 3-4y had Bea asked.", "You do sound like a good uncle. But your sister will be using emotional blackmail and manipulation to get the money you send as soon as she knows about it. Especially if they older ones feel responsible for the younger ones. I\u2019d bet that your sister will be either using them to guilt trip the older ones or threaten to not allow them contact once moved out. \nShe won\u2019t be using the money on bills, she\u2019ll be treating herself. Or using her money knowing sams will go to the household.\n\nIt may be worth looking to pay things direct as help rather than giving a cash allowance. That way you\u2019ll know that it\u2019s actually benefitting them not their mother. \n\nWhether it\u2019s covering rent or utilities for Dan and Sam. Or paying the bus pass itself.\nSending a basic food shop delivery once a week/fortnight, etc.", "A 22 year old with a kid is most likely not someone who was given tons of other opportunities and support.", "OP should definitely not help her in any way shape or form after this behavior. Sets a terrible precedent.", "Yeah that probably plays a factor. My sister hates me so I'm sure she talked shit about me to the kids. Maybe Bea believes them? She has no problem with me when I come bearing gifts though lol", "Keep reading OP'S comments. \n\nNot only has he been available, she has been doing the same as her mother. Wasting money on trips and beer while asking OP for money for the kids.", "So you said no to money for the doctor and then discovered a reason to justify it?", "You\u2019re acting as if they\u2019re all under the same circumstances and they\u2019re not. Bea already got out, the other two haven\u2019t. They need help, she doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s where the difference between it all is.", "you\u2019ve never lived paycheck to paycheck? and found yourself needing money for an unexpected expense. \n\nthey went out for drinks days later. and went on a \u201cmini-vacation\u201d a month later. do you begrudge them that? \n\nmy parents married young. they were paycheck to paycheck. they worked multiple jobs to take us to six flags once a year.  but they still needed help from time to time.", ">he describes her actions as petty\n\nSo do i, and i never even met her. We can see in the post why. \n\n>you\u2019re painting her as an issue for wanting attention from the one of the only positive role models in her life. \n\nI'm painting her as an issue for acting entitled to things that she's not entitled to (like staying in a luxury hotel for days or posting petty messages when she didn't get her way). \n\nAgain, if he doesn't want to spend time with her, he doesn't have to. He doesn't need a reason. She's not his daughter and as an uncle there isn't anything that morally obliges him to spend time with niece. Especially when said niece is a grown up and not a 3yo child. And that doesn't make him an asshole. Just because 2 people are related doesn't mean they need to be close. (For instance, sam often goes hungry and i didn't read about beth helping her, but she wants uncle to put her, her kid and her husband up in a luxury hotel)", "~~N T A~~ , but, I see where Bea is coming from if you refused to help her with a doctors bill for her kid (https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12uyro3/aita_for_inviting_my_nephew_and_niece_to_stay/#jh8ya12) while putting her siblings up in a high end hotel.\n\nThe circumstances are different, obviously, and I don't think you're an asshole for any of this, but it's not surprising you hurt Bea. I'd add, if you pick a fight with this with Bea rather than letting her have her feelings, you absolutely would be an asshole.\n\nEdit: Nevermind the meat is always in the comments, no question YTA if you're talking about \"If she does that, she's not getting the iPad Air she's been wanted for ages.

How lavish was the mini-vacation- are we talking a high end resort in another country, or a short road trip to a campground? And \"going out for beers\" is not some wildly lavish expense.

And while she made a lot of mistakes, she ended up turning things around as she got older. She got her BA and master\u2019s, bought her own home, and has raised four happy, well-loved children. And my folks, who were in a better financial position, set strong limits with her, but also made a point of showing the same kindness to her kids that you\u2019re showing Sam and Dan. Her oldest is in her late 20s now and still remembers fondly the toys my parents sent her.\n\nSo no, you don\u2019t have to save Bea from her current bad decisions.
