File something with the police that, as Baby\u2019s parents, you have chosen Grandma Mom to care for your child while away, and under *no circumstances* is the child to be in Grandma MIL\u2019s care. This gets ahead of the possibility of MIL starting shit, and gambling that when the police arrive the cops will just say \u201cwell idk they\u2019re both grandma and have an equal right\u201d.
