Don't want to get your stress levels up, but you're feeling might well be right.", "NTA. But why are these people getting all this information about your current life? They do not have your wife or your best interest or the grandchild's best interest at heart. \n\nGrey rock them. \n\nPlease let whoever is watching the child know these crazy people might try to come by.", "NTA\n\nThey sound very toxic and frankly have more consideration for their own wants than for the best interests of the child. \n\nI\u2019d keep them away as well.", "It was more of an imprisonment, but I agree", "Ironically, withholding a person's passport to get any labor or service from them can legally constitute human trafficking in the state I live in.", "We ended up going because they didn\u2019t start telling us that they should be the ones to watch our kid until 3 days before we went. We thought about canceling, but we were unable to get a refund on the hotel and most of the flight. My mom already booked time off and travelled down to our place to watch our kid.\n\nBut yeah, involving police or just trying to strong arm my mom into having them take our kid was our biggest fear. I can\u2019t think of any other reason for my in-laws to come up together considering their strained relationship with each other.\n\nWe were already uncomfortable with travelling that far away from our kid in the first place, and they added to that anxiety quite a bit. Luckily nothing happened, but now they are getting my wife\u2019s siblings and grandparents to tell her that she shouldn\u2019t cut her parents out of their grandchild\u2019s life.", "We started dating when I was 24 and she was 21. Now 31 and 28", "My family lives in Midwest US and her family lives in southern Canada. Though they live in a farming town while I am from a city. That is the only cultural difference between us.", "She knows they are the problem, but she spent her entire life until I got involved being controlled by them. When she ever did something to go against them, her siblings, grandparents and external family expressed their displeasure with her actions. The same thing is happening now, and she feels lost and lonely because of it.", "How so?", "In what way?", "That would have been a better choice of word actually!", "That is always what gets me too. Them doing the same thing that they feared what I would do. It gets crazier too because my wife\u2019s sister started dating a person from Columbia a few years ago. She was going to go and visit his family with him. They were also not happy about that, and tried to forbid her from going. They said that it was a dangerous place and she was going to get kidnapped there. They told her this by waiting for her to get done with work at 11:30 pm and ordering her to get into the car with them. They also brought her mom\u2019s new husband and her dad\u2019s girlfriend to pressure her into backing out on the trip. \n\nI always joke that for all of their fear of their adult kids getting kidnapped, they are oddly good at doing it themselves.", "Your wife needs to tell her mother that she has to earn her trust if she wants to be in her grandchild's life...and that every decision she has made so far has made her trust her mom less and less.\n\nShe needs to tell her mom \"this is my kid.  What I say goes.  You will respect my authority as a parent.  Period.  End of discussion.\"\n\nThat way...if her mom chooses to not have any part of the kid's life...it will the mom's choice not your wife's\n\nNow is the time to draw a line in the sand", "Is your kid still with your mom/you are still away? If so, you should contact your local police department and give them a heads up that you\u2019re concerned that an estranged relative is trying to take advantage of your travel to take your child away from the caretaker you have chosen in your absence. File something with the police that, as Baby\u2019s parents, you have chosen Grandma Mom to care for your child while away, and under *no circumstances* is the child to be in Grandma MIL\u2019s care. This gets ahead of the possibility of MIL starting shit, and gambling that when the police arrive the cops will just say \u201cwell idk they\u2019re both grandma and have an equal right\u201d. Cops are the first line of action for disputes, but they notoriously prioritize the status quo. \n\nIf you\u2019re already back, in future leave Grandma Mom with a notarized document saying she and no one else is to be caretaker for Baby.", "Its nice you have a nice relationship with her and it all worked out in the end.  And maybe you did help open her life up from her parents control\n\nBut if im doing my math right, you were 19 yo when you met a 16 yo online and when she turned 21 and you were 24, you went to see her and take her out of the country to japan\n\nIt can be seen innocently enough but you cant fault her parents for being protective of their daughter in this situation", "Wow that\u2019s not much of difference. I guess she just has a very controlling family. I don\u2019t blame you for cutting off relationship.  \nGood luck to you and your wife.  Tough situation.", "You need to talk to your wife and get her into therapy. If her family really is that controlling and they manipulated her like this, she needs some serious healing. \n\nYou need to be supportive of her and understand her dynamic with her parents and how you fit into that. Ultimately, they are her parents, so if she knows something is wrong with them, she needs to deal with them and set your family\u2019s boundaries. \n\nIt seems like your in-laws really are planning to do something - idk if it\u2019s as intense as kidnapping, though plausible. They may just invade your mom\u2019s home and impose on her. Either way, unfortunately you\u2019re going to have to postpone this trip and take care of your wife and child", "In the way of being creepy and controlling.", "16 and 19?   They could have been high school classmates, age wise.  That's not particularly problematic imo.", "They could have been, but they are internet friends, of different country.  And the parents didnt know this 19 yo who is interacting with their 16 yo", "Sure.   But the rest of the information suggests the parentd are problematic people.", "Your wife needs to learn to cut them off to a sliver of information.  \n\nThey don't need to know you're leaving the country.  \n\nThey don't need to know where your kid is.  \n\nThey don't need to know anything that doesn't directly involve them.  \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Your inlaws sound toxic.  It is not ok to allow toxic people around your children.  Cutting them off is the right thing to do until they can show they have no ulterior motives.", "NTA\n\nI mean after your trip, fine, see what happens, but absolutely no contact with your kid without you there.", "NTA, for all the reasons you have stated. These people are nutcases.", "Nta, dude, they locked up the passport of a 21 hear old adult. Nah, those ppl.gotta go", "NTA.  The ILs don't get to DEMAND anything. This is your child and your decision. If they don't want to be cut off for another 4 years they better learn to back off and stay in their lane.", "Unfortunately, that is my fault that they knew about the trip to Japan. My wife didn\u2019t want to tell them, but I am always scared that dying on a plane, so I wanted them to know that if it did happen that we wanted my brother to become my kid\u2019s guardian, and not to interfere with that. We ended up making a Will just in case.", "In another comment, OP said they started dating when he was 24 and she was 21. So the age gap is 3 years. Meaning, they met or were friends when she was 16 and he was 19. I might be wrong though.", "OP responded in another comment that there is a three-year age gap. So he would have been 19.", "19 I think. They have a 3 year difference.", "love how he's not replying to you", "So if your mom is not capable of handling that kind of a crisis, then you would be better off rescheduling", "What are your actual concerns? And are they worth the loss of the refund??", "They will interfere no matter what. Now you know this, so going forward, put them on an information diet. You wife knows her parents. Follow her lead. It's very hard for people who come from non dysfunctional families (or less dysfunctional) to fathom the amount of crazy that can come out. Telling them not to interfere will not get them to not interfere. \n\nDefinitely tell whoever is minding the child and try to get some sort of temporary (ie limited to while you are out of the country) thing notarized that gives them permission to act in the best interest for your child. Talk to a lawyer about it. \n\nYou want to be sure the grandparents don't try to come an take the child to keep the child from the grandparent you are allowing to watch the child. You're going to be on another continent.", "Because I already answered it. I was 19, and it was a friend group that played LoL. She joined because she was friends with the younger sister of one of my friends. We didn\u2019t talk outside of that group until a couple months before we started dating. Nothing about the post is about the age difference, and it would be pretty weird stretch if was a problem.", "Amitheasshole and slobbering all over yourself obsessing about age gaps, name a more iconic duo", "NTA OP, you are both too old to be informing her parents, and then arguing with them. Tell you wife no more info about trips, until after you return. You can't change their bizarre behavior, but you can change your own.", "Lol my mother always \u201cfeared\u201d I\u2019d end up in an abusive relationship. What she actually feared was me finding healthy relationships (wether romantic or friendly) and realize how badly abused I was at home. I don\u2019t believe a second they feared your wife was gonna be trafficked more that you\u2019d still her (they don\u2019t really seem to see people as object but more possession)\n\nEdit: yeah might projecting a bit tonight sorry", "This is a bot, it\u2019s stealing from u/the__riker__maneuver below", "My concerns are that they are going to keep trying take control of my kid. And I am wondering if I am an asshole blowing this out of proportion because that is what my wife\u2019s family is telling us.", "Oh, I completely agree with you. My wife had some pretty awful boyfriends before me, but for some reason they only expressed hatred for me. I think it was because I was a danger of her moving away unlike the other ones.", "Your in-laws have already committed felonies against their own daughters, there's nothing \"out of proportion\" here.", "So you're concerned that your child is going to be ... kidnapped? But you didn't reschedule because you wouldn't get your deposit back? Am I understanding that correctly?", "I think there\u2019s a lot of life experience that takes place in that age range for a lot of people. 18-19 you\u2019re leaving home for college or even if you\u2019re staying home you\u2019re looking for a career path. Vs a kid who just got their drivers license. \n\nI think 3 years when you get older is nothing, but that young it seems like a lot of experience difference. Not saying the parents are right but I could understand the concern", "They have been together for 7 years now. The parents need to move on", "He said they got together at 21 and 24. I fail to see what the issue here.", "They are older now, though"]}
