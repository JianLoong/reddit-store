I have had problems with them for years. They accused me of being a sex trafficker because me and my wife were going to Japan after meeting for the first time. We had known each other for 5 years prior from being gaming friends, and she was 21 at the time. She asked her mom if it was okay to go, and her mom said yes. Booked the ticket, and then two days later said no. They then locked up her passport to prevent her from going. We ended up married 18 months later after going to Canada to see her myself. A bunch of other fights happened for the next 6 years around them disagreeing what we were doing with our lives, where we moved to, what school she went to, where I was working, etc. \n\nI ended up cutting off contact with them 4 years ago because of all of that, though my wife kept talking to them. We ended up talking it out with her parents when we had our child two years ago. Trying to let bygones be bygones and not have awkwardness around the kid. \n\nFor our 5th year anniversary, we decided to go to Japan to celebrate, and have my mother watch the child while we were gone for a week and half. Then when my wife\u2019s parents found out, they got upset and said they don\u2019t trust my mom watching our kid because she was a drunk (they have only met my mother twice, and the one time was at my wedding where she got drunk during it). They kept insisting that my wife\u2019s mother was the one who should watch her. We said no, and then demanded to have my wife\u2019s mother at least come up to help watch my child for a day while we were gone. My wife\u2019s father then said he was also going to come up with her too. This set off some flags because my wife\u2019s parents have been bitterly divorced for 8 years, and hated being around each other but have to because they wanted to co-parent their younger children. They have also never came up together before. \n\nI have a feeling they were planning take my kid away from who we decided we wanted to watch our kid while we gone until we cut off all contact with them and told them they can\u2019t see our kid again.\n\nIt feels weird typing this out because how fake it all sounds.

I didn't want to separate my daughter from her Dad's family so I offered to send her for a visit to Ohio since I was so close to the inlaws who lived there.

They sound they're at a level of crazy where you need to make sure the kindergarden knows they can't pick your child up or even be left out of sight with your child. Don't want to get your stress levels up, but you're feeling might well be right.", "NTA. But why are these people getting all this information about your current life? They do not have your wife or your best interest or the grandchild's best interest at heart. \n\nGrey rock them. \n\nPlease let whoever is watching the child know these crazy people might try to come by.", "NTA\n\nThey sound very toxic and frankly have more consideration for their own wants than for the best interests of the child. \n\nI\u2019d keep them away as well.", "It was more of an imprisonment, but I agree", "Ironically, withholding a person's passport to get any labor or service from them can legally constitute human trafficking in the state I live in.", "We ended up going because they didn\u2019t start telling us that they should be the ones to watch our kid until 3 days before we went. We thought about canceling, but we were unable to get a refund on the hotel and most of the flight. My mom already booked time off and travelled down to our place to watch our kid.\n\nBut yeah, involving police or just trying to strong arm my mom into having them take our kid was our biggest fear. I can\u2019t think of any other reason for my in-laws to come up together considering their strained relationship with each other.\n\nWe were already uncomfortable with travelling that far away from our kid in the first place, and they added to that anxiety quite a bit. Luckily nothing happened, but now they are getting my wife\u2019s siblings and grandparents to tell her that she shouldn\u2019t cut her parents out of their grandchild\u2019s life.", "We started dating when I was 24 and she was 21. Now 31 and 28", "My family lives in Midwest US and her family lives in southern Canada. Though they live in a farming town while I am from a city. That is the only cultural difference between us.", "She knows they are the problem, but she spent her entire life until I got involved being controlled by them. When she ever did something to go against them, her siblings, grandparents and external family expressed their displeasure with her actions. The same thing is happening now, and she feels lost and lonely because of it.", "How so?", "In what way?", "That would have been a better choice of word actually!", "That is always what gets me too. Them doing the same thing that they feared what I would do. It gets crazier too because my wife\u2019s sister started dating a person from Columbia a few years ago. She was going to go and visit his family with him. They were also not happy about that, and tried to forbid her from going. They said that it was a dangerous place and she was going to get kidnapped there. They told her this by waiting for her to get done with work at 11:30 pm and ordering her to get into the car with them. They also brought her mom\u2019s new husband and her dad\u2019s girlfriend to pressure her into backing out on the trip. \n\nI always joke that for all of their fear of their adult kids getting kidnapped, they are oddly good at doing it themselves.", "Your wife needs to tell her mother that she has to earn her trust if she wants to be in her grandchild's life...and that every decision she has made so far has made her trust her mom less and less.\n\nShe needs to tell her mom \"this is my kid.  What I say goes.  You will respect my authority as a parent.  Period.  End of discussion.\"\n\nThat way...if her mom chooses to not have any part of the kid's life...it will the mom's choice not your wife's\n\nNow is the time to draw a line in the sand", "Is your kid still with your mom/you are still away? If so, you should contact your local police department and give them a heads up that you\u2019re concerned that an estranged relative is trying to take advantage of your travel to take your child away from the caretaker you have chosen in your absence. File something with the police that, as Baby\u2019s parents, you have chosen Grandma Mom to care for your child while away, and under *no circumstances* is the child to be in Grandma MIL\u2019s care. This gets ahead of the possibility of MIL starting shit, and gambling that when the police arrive the cops will just say \u201cwell idk they\u2019re both grandma and have an equal right\u201d. Cops are the first line of action for disputes, but they notoriously prioritize the status quo. \n\nIf you\u2019re already back, in future leave Grandma Mom with a notarized document saying she and no one else is to be caretaker for Baby.", "Its nice you have a nice relationship with her and it all worked out in the end.  And maybe you did help open her life up from her parents control\n\nBut if im doing my math right, you were 19 yo when you met a 16 yo online and when she turned 21 and you were 24, you went to see her and take her out of the country to japan\n\nIt can be seen innocently enough but you cant fault her parents for being protective of their daughter in this situation", "Wow that\u2019s not much of difference. I guess she just has a very controlling family. I don\u2019t blame you for cutting off relationship.  \nGood luck to you and your wife.  Tough situation.", "You need to talk to your wife and get her into therapy. If her family really is that controlling and they manipulated her like this, she needs some serious healing. \n\nYou need to be supportive of her and understand her dynamic with her parents and how you fit into that. Ultimately, they are her parents, so if she knows something is wrong with them, she needs to deal with them and set your family\u2019s boundaries. \n\nIt seems like your in-laws really are planning to do something - idk if it\u2019s as intense as kidnapping, though plausible. They may just invade your mom\u2019s home and impose on her. Either way, unfortunately you\u2019re going to have to postpone this trip and take care of your wife and child", "In the way of being creepy and controlling.", "16 and 19?   They could have been high school classmates, age wise.  That's not particularly problematic imo.", "They could have been, but they are internet friends, of different country.  And the parents didnt know this 19 yo who is interacting with their 16 yo", "Sure.   But the rest of the information suggests the parentd are problematic people."]}
