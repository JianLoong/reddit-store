I asked if John was still single, and he said he was, then he jokingly said, \"No one will have me.\" He has really low self-confidence, and I sensed he was being half serious, so I said,\" Look, you have a 10/10 personality, and you're a really good-looking guy. Anyone would be lucky to date you,\" he chuckled and thanked me, and we continued talking.
