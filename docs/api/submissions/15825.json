How would you feel if a paid employee blocked your kid from seeing their parent?\n\nMost people are focusing on tearing apart trespassing rules. My original YTA is about you blocking a mother from seeing her baby. Then saying its cool, because you received money to block that kid from its mother.", "Of course I'm assuming; you're also assuming I'm wrong? Its kind of inherent in every AITA; you fill in the blanks. Its not like any of us witness this first hand. \n\nI agree, the real estate issues are tangential. I shouldn't have fallen for the bait. \n\nIn all of this, its interesting how many people care more about property laws as opposed to the Childs interests. Apparently, blocking a mother from a child is okay...as long as we're clear about property laws.", "I understand and I totally agree with you. I don\u2019t feel comfortable preventing the wife from seeing her child. I was instructed by the husband not to let her come in or any who is not permitted on the property. \n\nI am just trying to do my job in peace, with no drama.", "I get it, you're in the middle of a crappy situation. Sometimes, that happens and we have tough choices to make. I'm not trying to attack you as a person, this is a question of whether you are an AH morally because of the situation thrust upon you. \n\nI side with the mother on this because I see it a a Bully tactic and you're the enforcer chosen by the father. He wants her to suffer and is using you to make it happen. I see why he's angry; having a spouse cheats makes a lot of people want revenge. \n\nThere is no way to avoid the drama. The only option is to tell each parent that you refuse to be their mouthpiece.", "Im not sure how right of first refusal has nothing to do with this situation.. Those are laws for real estate?\n\nAlso, those martial laws are not Canada wide, eh. I live in Ontario and we dont have the same clean marital laws you do in the Prairies\n\nBut the laws are the same for denying visitation to the noncustodial parent. However, we dont have that information, so it's hard to determine what OP can and can't do.\n\nThe nanny is preventing access to the house, not the child. But because the child is in the house, access to the child is also being prevented. The mother can file a court order to resolve this matter or call the cops and have them bring the child out. There are options, but for the parents to resolve, not OP who is stuck in the middle of this mess...\n\nPoor kid, though... must be tough listening to parents trash talk each other and fight over them as if they are some kind of trophy... at least from the sounds of it..", "OooooWeeee that's a hot uncomfortable mess. I would go with listening to the person that pays you.\nNTA", "I\u2019m so sorry you are in this situation. \n\nNTA in general. Your boss is TA. He should not be making you gatekeeper of his house and child.\n\nDepending on where you are and the legal situation between the parents, the wife may have every right to go into the house and see her child. Or she may not. You don\u2019t really know.\n\nEither way, you shouldn\u2019t be in the middle of it. You should tell them both, at the same time, that the situation is making you very uncomfortable. Your job is to look after their child and you want to focus on that. Treat this as a business problem\u2014you have a job to do and you need support from your bosses to do it.", "NTA \nAs long as the wife has been made aware of the new arrangements by the husband it is not your responsibility to make changes to the restrictions. Yes she is the mother, but she also knows her husband\u2019s schedule and they will need to learn how to coparent. We have no idea what her intentions are. The boundaries should be clear and an expectation needs to be set by the parent\u2019s with the kids what is appropriate and what is not appropriate.", "NTA Tell her that the custody situation is unclear and you don\u2019t want to be accused of assisting a kidnapping. That you love working in both places. That from here on in you need something in writing from BOTH of them to set out a schedule of whose house you should be at and when with the expectation that you will deny access to the parent who doesn\u2019t live there. Basically turn it on them as employers to give you clear instructions.", "NTA.  You are doing what your boss told you to do... What a terrible situation to be caught in the middle of.", "I think you should listen to and follow instructions from whomever gave you the baby to looked after at the start of the day. Let them work it out between themselves", "Can't you talk to your boss about taking their kid for a walk so she still gets to be with them without her entering the house? Like I get that he doesn't want her near the house, but denying a mother time with her child is awful. \n\nIn any case you're NTA.", "NTA but I don\u2019t see this as a sustainable job to work for both sides", "I don't think you're TA, but you might be better off getting a different job - or at least, saying you can only work for one half of the couple going forward", "This! Do this!", "You just do what the person paying you told you to do. \n\nThe one thing you might want to do is to have the husband tell you in writing that he is the one telling you not to let the wife in.", "Parents have legal rights to ask for access to their children from third parties. Full stop. Even if they are divorcing and other one does not want it. His instructions do not beat the legal entitlement to get your child.\n\nHusband needs court order to prevent access to kids.", "He's mostly barring access to the house because it sounds like the wife does get the toddler. But until it's settled in court, OP needs to just do as told and direct her to the lawyers so that they can settle it.", "There is enough detail to not assume\u2026.. and I try NOT to assume anything and ASK op questions if needed. Anyway, no one is ok with her blocking the child per the husband\u2019s request, but she isn\u2019t an AH for doing it. I personally would either ask for a sit down and clearly spelled out rules or find another job. This is a train wreck waiting to happen!", "Like you, I don't think OP should enforce morally reprehensible rules. Keeping a mother from her own kid is wrong; even if your boss tells you to (we're not talking about an unfit parent, OP clearly states the mother has partial access). The right thing would have been a sitdown, but that's in the past now. \n\nOP didn't ask for a sitdown. OP chose to enforce the rules her boss made up that prevents a child from seeing their mother. It was disguised as trespass rules, probably to circumvent parental rules. When I read through these posts, that's becoming a lot clearer. I was initially wrong to mention access to the home, I should have focused on child access; I mixed those up in my head and made them into a single issue (I should have ignored the trespass bait). \n\nThis train wreck has already happened. At one point do you condone a co-parent blocking access to a child? Its not like the Dad is even around; he's away with work. He is literally telling an employee he would rather the child have only the nanny...than any parent at all while he's not around.\n\nThe ship sailed on this being okay. The kid is being used in the divorce and the Nanny is participating. \n\nI have quit a job for less. I was unemployed for months, its not an easy choice and I understand the problems that the Nanny is facing financially and why she may not be able to quit.", "ESH\n\nWithout a court order you refuse a request like that.", "NTA. Whoever pays you is who you listen to. You are there to do a job, that's it. You have no input in this situation and if you are told someone is no longer welcome by your boss, that's that.", "Take it he's the one paying you? You're gonna have to do what you need to to get paid, but I'd be looking  for another job", "NTA, but honestly, you need a different job. I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with this. It will probably get worse.", "Youre stuck between a rock and a hard place. \n\nHere's the problem. \n\nThe husband is controlling. Legally he CAN NOT keep the mother from her child. \n\nLegally neither can you. \n\nIf she comes to the house and says \"Release my child to me\" she has the RIGHT and YOU can NOT stop her. You do not have parental authority. \n\nI am willing to bet the husband tells you not to let mom have the child. \n\nWithout a custody order, you are being used as a pawn to alienate the mother from her child. \n\nReach out to an attorney.", "NTA. \n\nWho is your employer? If it is the husband, then you follow his instructions. If the wife is your employer, then you follow her instructions.", "Your employer is telling you not to allow someone into his home, if you want to keep your job you need to do as he asks.  It doesn't matter if it's morally right or wrong.  No, you're NTAH, the husband and wife are.", "OP needs to calmly recite to both of them the paragraph in her post starting with her being in the middle and the child being the only priority. She summed it up perfectly.", "If she had a key, this wouldn't be an issue. But she apparently doesn't, so that's that. Of someone has to let her in, she can be denied entry.", "I'm not a lawyer but I wonder if it would be considered a constructive eviction. Still not OP's place to judge", "Still depends. If he changes the locks while she's at work, it wouldn't change her right to enter the home at all. Just because she doesn't have a key that doesn't mean she's lost any rights to enter the house. It could just mean that she's being illegally denied entry.", "NTA. You would listen to your boss in any other occupation. It\u2019s just weird that the kids involved. He could not want her in the house bc she wants to take things. It sucks all the way around for you and the kid.", "NTA, this is a horrible situation to be in.\n\nYou should not be expected to be a bouncer for your employer.\n\nAll I can suggest is that you ask your employer to clarify the current custody arrangement as it applies to you and your job. In writing, preferably. \n\nDo you have a union or professional advisor you can consult? Nannies and daycare centres have to deal with this stuff ALL THE TIME, so there must be appropriate systems.", "I don\u2019t think there is a judgement for this. I was 14 years old, left with 3 kids. I thought they were all the one mom\u2019s. Some other lady comes to the door wanting to get her kid. I said \u2018no\u2019. Suddenly I\u2019m getting multiple phone calls (from a friends mother to add pressure) that I\u2019m keeping a kid away from their Mom. I\u2019m confused, 14 years old, (and, yes, it was backwoods Iowa white trash), not knowing what to do with this kid. \nMy suggestion is get out. There is no right answer.", "NTA. Treat it like a normal job and listen to your boss.", "NTA, you are doing what your asked by your boss, the one who is paying you! I'm sorry you're stuck in the middle it sounds utterly anxiety inducing and awkward!", "NTA. So sorry that you're caught between a contentious split but you're the nanny FOR THE CHILD. When the child is at the husband's place, you abide by his wishes and the same for when at the wife's place.  You can have a discussion with the husband and wife for the ground rules until they settle their affairs but until then, your duty is continuity for the child.", "NTA. This is a crummy situation to be in. You really can't allow her in to your bosses residence. And you want to help their child weather this storm. I suggest you try planning trips to the park or special long walks so that you're respecting your bosses wishes, while allowing for a loophole that allows the child to see their mother. Explain to the mom that you will put her child first above all else and help them to get through this scary time, and to respect that she has to let you do your job as her husband demands or else you might be relieved of your duties, and then unable to help her child. Good luck.", "YTA, beucase you are defitnely supporting the abusive parent and his parental alienating campaign The moral thing for you to do is quit if you have an issue with disregarding his directive and taking his money.", "Step 1 is don't listen to reddit for legal advice. You've probably noticed that the advice in here is mutually contradictory and people are making a ton of assumptions about what the law is wherever you live, but it's all guesswork and assumption.\n\nIf you're through an agency, look to them for direction. If not, you may want to spend some time finding an attorney who will do a free or reduced price consultation.", "None of that has anything to do with OP."]}
