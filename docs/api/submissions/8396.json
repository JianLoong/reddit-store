I know that he gave money to Kai so he could quit his job and launch his own buisness. Kai has two employees and he stopped working for one years and now he works part time. \n\nMe and my husband don\u2019t have kids yet but between the two of us we have quite a lot of nephews and friends with kids so we know some things.\n\nThe one who is 5 go to preschool and the other one go part time to daycare. Luke and Kai have a nanny when needed and both their parents babysit a lot. \n\nFrom what they told us, Kai takes care of the children most of the times, (sometimes when he is working at home he has the nanny taking care of the kids when he could do it himself). They also have a routine, every week they alternate between date night and what they call \u00ab baby and me \u00bb date. For the baby and me date they take one kid every two weeks and they do an activity with him, the other one is babysat. They say that this way they can spend time with just one kid.\n\nKai also do a lot of stuff like play dates and once or twice a week he goes with the kids to a kid and me gym class.\n\nYesterday Luke was working from home so me and my husband went over to their place for tea time and Kai was telling us that the pastries they were serving were made by him and the kids during a class they went earlier were you could bake with your kids. We all took tea together and when the kids went to play we started talking more seriously. \n\nKai was talking about how he was worried at first about finding a just balance between the kids, their couple and their personnal needs but that now after two years he felt like everything was falling into place.\n\nI felt like it was easy for him to say that and I told him so. I explained that for me everything he was doing with his kids was having fun and/or having them babysat. I mean he could easily not work and take care of them and not put the youngest at daycare. Once very two weeks they go on a date and someone else take care of them. He is always taking his kids to activities and for me this is not parenting it\u2019s just having fun. If Luke wasn\u2019t here to finance everything (the activities, the nanny and his buisness) I\u2019m not sure Kai coud take care of them.\n\nAfter I said that, Kai left to go with the kids. Luke got mad at me and told me that I overstep and I had no idea how much Kai changed his life around for the kids and how he was doing everything he could to take care of them properly.\n\nIn the car my husband told me that I went too far, especially when we know how stressed and anxious Kai was when they first had the kids. I think that I was just giving my point of view and helping them for the future.", "created_utc": 1674769847, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10m3li8/aita_for_telling_my_friends_partner_that_what_he/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you have any idea how much energy it takes to watch a 3 and 5 year old? It's not possible to actually work because they require constant attention.", "YTA! Oh my God! These two people restructured their entire lives to take in 2 children! What is your actual problem? \n\nYou don't even have kids! From the sound of it they are doing absolutely amazing. All of those fun trips are a chance to teach their kids and enjoy time with them. I can not believe you actually judged their parenting. Wow. Harsh doesn't even begin to cover it.", "YTA. They sound really devoted and involved with their children. Are you really just mad they\u2019re financially in a better place and not struggling? You sound jealous.", "YTA. Really curious as to what makes you think this is in anyway appropriate. You decided to give your unsolicited opinion on a family upon hearing its going well? You literally decided to yuck their yum. Why? \n\n> I explained that for me everything he was doing with his kids was having fun \n\nHow dare a parent have fun with their child! Better ruin it.", "YTA.  It sounds to me like he's a fully present parent most of the time. It's ok to need sitters/nannies while you work, have a date, etc.  He and the kids doing classes and activities is bonding time.  You need to stay in your own lane, especially since you have no idea what goes into actually raising a kid.", "YTA.  They sound like lovely parents who are making a wonderful home for their kids.  They are making sure their kids are taken care of and loved.  Having a nanny or using daycare/preschool does not make anyone less of a parent.", "YTA\n\nThis is not your business at all. \n\nYou clearly, despite the garbage comment that you know so much because you have nieces and nephews, know ZERO about parenting. \n\nThe audacity to even for one second suggest they aren't parenting is amazing.", "YTA.\nPeople who work are still parents.\nPeople who have the resources to enrol in daycare are still parents. \nPeople who hire nannies are still parents.\nPeople who balance their intimate relationships with family responsibilities are still parents.\nPeople who love and have fun with their kids are definitely parents. \nPeople who recognise kids need to one on one time to grow are definitely parents. \n\nYou know who isn't a parent? You. \nKeep your \"advice\" to yourself and reflect on your actions. The only one who needs to improve or do better here is you.", "You don't get the act as a gatekeeper to parents from atop your high horse. They found a balance that works for them and for their children. A normal friend would be HAPPY for them but you just can't do that, can you? You had to take a dump on them.\n\nYTA and please get some kind of therapy. You need it.", "YTA. What was the point of offering this opinion? In what is this going to help them. All your doing is being a terrible friend. Kai was confiding and sharing an heartfelt milestone for them and you choose that time to shit on a nice moment. \n\nSounds like he IS parenting, he\u2019s just very fortunate to have more resources than most. Besides, he could very well just be tell you the \u201cgood\u201d and \u201ceasy\u201d moments. \n\nAlso, you have no kids? How are you to know better than him.", "YTA and WTF? You are not a parent, and that shows. Yikes. Everything you described, the juggling of schedules, the school, the kid dates, all of that? Parenting. I mean, WTF do you think parenting is?", "YTA, so damn much.\n\nHe didn't do anything wrong, said how happy he was that life was settling down again and how his worriedsweren't warranted and you, without being asked, go \"Well, it's easy for you because you ain't being a real parent\"???? Wtf is wrong with you?\n\nThey even told you that he's the one taking care of the kids most of the time. Sending your kids to daycare is beneficial to them, not a sign of a bad parent or a parent not doing his \"job.\" Hiring a nanny or asking others for help sometimes to make sure both the parents' and the childrens' lives are going as smoothly as possible is also not a bad sign. Making them have as much fun as possible with you also is great. What's your issue? That you won't be having such an \"easy\" time with your future children?", "YTA \n\nYou criticized a new family on how they are raising their kids. It sounds like the couple has either adopted or fostered two children. These kids could have come from varied backgrounds (eg. from overseas, or were abused, neglected or have special health needs). \n\nSo right now they are focused on building a bond with the kids and creating a safe home and parental relationship. So what if they use nannies and do fun activities? It takes a village. \n\nThey are also preserving their own couple relationship (which often takes a beating when kids enter the picture). \n\nSo the only comments you should make are ones of support and kudos. \n\nBTW, when will you be adopting/fostering two kids yourself?  Edit: consider calling to apologize. You were out of line.", "YT incredibly gaping A. For one thing you AREN\u2019T a parent and likely know much less than you think you do about being one; for another thing, even if you were, you would really have no right to criticize someone else\u2019s parenting arrangement like this.", "*screams* YTA!!!\n\nWhat fresh hell is this? So anyone who uses a nanny, or a frequent babysitter, isn\u2019t a parent? Or if you take your kid to activities often? Or\u2026 both of those things together?? \n\nSeriously, OP, this is one of the worst things I\u2019ve ever heard. I would have lost my mind. And kudos to Kai for still working because it\u2019s great for kids to see their parents work hard for what they have. Not that it\u2019s ANY of your business. The only way your comment would make sense is if they said the nanny always took the kids to their activities. But he\u2019s going! He\u2019s both parenting them and playing with them! Treating them and learning with them! \n\nThey\u2019re privileged, working, but still involved, parents.", "YTA - \"I've never been a parent but I know people with kids so I know a thing or two\"\n\nNo. You don't. And you don't get to gatekeep how someone else spends time with or raises their children. Nothing you've described is bad. Adopt or grow your own and then you still don't get to tell them how to parent their own kids.", "INFO:  did Kai and Luke ask for your honest appraisal of their parenting arrangements?  No?  You just dropped a big judgmental turd in the middle of lunch? Well then YTA.", "YTA! They are parents, you are not, and you gave them unsolicited advice and judgment about their parenting style. Taking your children to activities is parenting, and you also have no idea the work that goes into caring for the children when you're not around.\n\nMind your business and stop pretending you were trying to \"help\" them.", "YTA. Why even go there? Are the children happy, thriving, and cared for? And why are parenting and having fun mutually exclusive? And how is it even REMOTELY your business to comment (much less criticize) their parenting unless you\u2019re asked for advice?\n\nYou have your head so far up your ass I cant imagine you\u2019ll ever be invited to tea again! Your husband is right, you were not \u201chelping,\u201d you were being a jerk.", "YTA\n\nThey found a balance that works for them. As long as Luke and the kids are also happy, what's the issue? Would you tell a stay at home mother she wasn't parenting because she wasn't paying the bills for everything the kids do, or because one child was in daycare?", "YTA. Nothing more to add than what\u2019s been said, I just wanted to add one more vote to make sure it\u2019s crystal clear.", "YTA. I get why they still need a nanny if they are still working, doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s from home or not. And parenting is parenting, no matter how \u2018fun\u2019 the activity is. \n\nFor someone who doesn\u2019t have kids you come across incredibly judgemental. Also having nieces and nephews is not like parenting because you can give them back when it gets too much. \n\nAlso, parents are allowed to have time off from their kids, wherever it\u2019s together or they do something separate from each other. It\u2019s up to them.", "You very much did overstep. You yourself admitted that you don't have any children, all your the nieces and nephews in the world wouldn't make you qualified to tell other people how to raise children. Do you think that parents should not be trying to have fun with their children? YTA, stick to topics you're actually qualified to criticize.", "Jesus tap dancing christ..\n\n\nOh man.. not only are YTA,\n\n\nI cannot wait for the day you have to eat your words! \n\n\nMy ex SIL had so many opinions on what my daughter should and shouldn't be doing at this age or that time, etc. She thought she knew absolutely everything there was to know because ya know,  one of her friends had a kid! \n\n\nWanna guess who called me crying,  and asking questions constantly when she had her first baby? \n\n\nHow they PARENT their children is none of your business and you stepped so far over the line I'm shocked you typed this whole thing out and STILL had the nerve to ask if YTA. \n\n\nOne on one time with each individual child is super important! You would know that if you had kids though. Just because they have the money to afford a nanny doesn't mean they're not parenting.  \n\n\nThere are just so many things wrong with your whole post, but just a side note for you.. having nieces and nephews doesn't mean you know shit about parenting. Actually it means,  YOU'RE the one \"only doing fun things\". \n\nGet over yourself", "YTA- sorry but nothing this couple is doing is bad for the kids.  they are spending time with them, taking them out one on one and making sure their own relationship is solid!\n\nHaving the kids learn to cook is a GOOD thing. You come off as sounding rather jealous.\n\nWhy the heck can't parenting be fun? Why cant they go out as much as they want to learn things?", "YTA. It sounds like Kai and Luke have found a method of parenting that allows them to maintain a healthy relationship while building a healthy relationship with their kids.\nAnd you don\u2019t even have kids. Nephews and Nieces are not the same. You overstepped and as of now, are in no position to judge.", "YTA. Do you even hear yourself? Get your big fat nose out of other peoples business.", "Yta \n\nWell ok they babysit the kids quite often but \"*he could easily not work and take care of them and not put the youngest at daycare\" * is a no, like what having kids means to not work and quit everything you do to watch them? Not a lot of people would have kids then. And jesus *\"Once very two weeks they go on a date and someone else take care of them\"* so by you they shouldn't be allowed to take time for their couple? Only once every 2 weeks?\n\nAnd what they *\"only have fun time\"* ? They are taking the child to do parent/child activities, which seems good for their relationship and development, also you don't live with them, what do you know about the rest of the time of their day? And Wth would you want them to do anyway ? \n\nFor me you are just jealous of their situation and relationship with their kids.", "Yup, YTA. So much YTA. Big time. Huge. I am amazed Kai and Luke did not kick you out as soon as you were done speaking. Do not expect to be invited back EVER again.\n\nI mean. The nerve of Kai, right, arranging a date with his partner and co-parent EVERY TWO WEEKS? Twice a month, he gets one on one with his partner. Otherwise, he is working or kid-wrangling. The parent-kid gym classes, the music classes, the kid-friendly baking, all this is the work of a parent trying to keep children engaged, enriched, and safely occupied. Sure, it's fun, but that doesn't mean it (a) isn't work, (b) is what Kai would choose to do with his free time if it was just him, (c) isn't a hit to Kai's career, and (d) isn't \"real parenting.\" Do you expect this man to serve you tea and pastries and tell you nothing but the miserable parts? Just all about his struggles with bedtime, potty training, and the horrible threes? Is he supposed to confess his every parenting agony before you believe that this is work? \n\nI mean, apparently you *don't* believe parenting is work, because you think Kai could watch a pre-schooler and do his job simultaneously, a thing most employers object to.\n\nAnd yeah, without Luke's financial support, Kai probably *wouldn't* be able to do the things he does, but so what? Primary parent/primary paycheck is a really common way for couples to divide up the work they do for their families. Without Kai, Luke wouldn't be able to go to the office every day, pursue his ambitions, and support the family financially. Neither of them can do this alone.", "YTA", "YTA. You just have an outsider view of their life. Sounds like they\u2019re working to make sure the kids are well taken care of.", "YTA- nothing you mentioned is even your business. Keep your comments to yourself, especially since you have never been a parent. \n\nIf their kids are happy, safe, and healthy, then they're doing a fine job. Everyone parents differently.", "YTA - you are judging their parenting by your own perceptions of what a parent should do. You also sound very jealous about their lifestyle. \n\nParenting comes in many forms. These parents are doing a great job socialising, educating and stimulating these kids as well as making sure they are spending quality time with them.", "YTA. Work from home does NOT mean he's able to care for two kids at the same time.\nBeing an aunt or uncle does NOT mean you understand parenting", "YTA. You have no idea what it's like to be a parent. You have no kids. \n\nYou don't get to put down Kai. Side note daycare is great for kids as it exposes them to other kids. \n\nI hope they drop you as a friend. They don't need that negatively from someone who thinks they know best", "YTA\n\nYou're not even a parent so you have zero footing to criticize someone else's parenting. Even if you had kids it's not your place to tell someone else they don't meet your own standards for child rearing.", "Did they ask you for your point of view? Did they ask you to help them with their future? Nope and nope. YTA big time.", "YTA. Nobody cares about what you think. They sound like great parents, with resources to help them so they\u2019re not burnt out.", "YTA.   Even if you have kids you aren't the Parenting Police.\n\nGive opinion for you about your own life", "YTA. I think everyone has covered why.", "Judgemental much, YTA", "YTA. First of all, \u201cthey took the children under their care?\u201d Don\u2019t you mean they adopted them? Why are you trying to discredit their role as parents? You sound jealous. Does it bother you that your friend has a happy home life?", "Yta\n\nTell me you don\u2019t have kids without telling me you don\u2019t have kids \ud83d\ude44", "YTA. I find it hard to believe you would've told a straight woman she's not a real mom because her son has daycare and she goes on date nights with her husband (tf?). The only reasons you're trying to bring down Kai are that he's gay and the societal stereotype that men can't do \"real parenting.\"", "YTA I didn't read were he did anything wrong, mind your own business and stop being judgmental over nothing.", "YTA. Their life is their life and it works for them. Are the kids mistreated and miserable? Nope, then guess what, it works for them. Having 1;1 time with each other and also with each child is an awesome routine. You upset your friends with your opinion but in reality it sounds like you are a little jealous of their life.", "YTA - No one asked for your opinion yet you still felt the need to give it. Your take was not a good one and it's not down to you to police how others parent.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m curious about how you think your comments will help them in the future? \n\nSomehow Kai and Luke are both working and managing to have high-quality interactions with their children. That\u2019s actually really amazing and good for them. By the way, just because Kai has fun with his kids doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t parenting going on there too.\n\nAlso, I can\u2019t follow your logic. Kai should stay home to look after the kids that he\u2019s already having too much fun with. Is that to reduce financial pressure on Luke or for the kids\u2019 benefit? The kids have a great quality of life and giving up an income stream puts more pressure on Luke. Kai is contributing by running a business. It honestly just seems like Kai can\u2019t win with you. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to help them, you just want to see Kai be more miserable. Why is that? What\u2019s making you jealous?", "YTA - yea he\u2019s parenting his child. He\u2019s probably a better parent because he has help. It\u2019s clear that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about", "\n>Me and my husband don\u2019t have kids yet but between the two of us we have quite a lot of nephews and friends with kids so we know some things.\n\nYou know literally nothing about parenting as you are not parents.

Because you have nephews and nieces you know how to parent. Come on, lady. YTA.", "You did go to far.  Part of parenting is taking time to spend one on one with each child, making a relationship work while doing so, having nannies/child care in place for work or other things, and the list goes on from there.  There are a lot of parents out there that have their kids in activities, school, sports, and other things and then have a date night for themselves as a couple and maybe even one on one time with the kids.  It is all part of parenting.  Parenting is not only about the care of the kids--it is love, discipline, taking care of and making sure of needs, and going to school.  Preschool or child care is good for kids at these ages because they learn how to play with others and social skills.", "YTA.

I know that he gave money to Kai so he could quit his job and launch his own buisness. Kai has two employees and he stopped working for one years and now he works part time. \n\nMe and my husband don\u2019t have kids yet but between the two of us we have quite a lot of nephews and friends with kids so we know some things.\n\nThe one who is 5 go to preschool and the other one go part time to daycare. Luke and Kai have a nanny when needed and both their parents babysit a lot. \n\nFrom what they told us, Kai takes care of the children most of the times, (sometimes when he is working at home he has the nanny taking care of the kids when he could do it himself). They also have a routine, every week they alternate between date night and what they call \u00ab baby and me \u00bb date. For the baby and me date they take one kid every two weeks and they do an activity with him, the other one is babysat. They say that this way they can spend time with just one kid.\n\nKai also do a lot of stuff like play dates and once or twice a week he goes with the kids to a kid and me gym class.\n\nYesterday Luke was working from home so me and my husband went over to their place for tea time and Kai was telling us that the pastries they were serving were made by him and the kids during a class they went earlier were you could bake with your kids. We all took tea together and when the kids went to play we started talking more seriously. \n\nKai was talking about how he was worried at first about finding a just balance between the kids, their couple and their personnal needs but that now after two years he felt like everything was falling into place.\n\nI felt like it was easy for him to say that and I told him so. I explained that for me everything he was doing with his kids was having fun and/or having them babysat. I mean he could easily not work and take care of them and not put the youngest at daycare. Once very two weeks they go on a date and someone else take care of them. He is always taking his kids to activities and for me this is not parenting it\u2019s just having fun. If Luke wasn\u2019t here to finance everything (the activities, the nanny and his buisness) I\u2019m not sure Kai coud take care of them.\n\nAfter I said that, Kai left to go with the kids. Luke got mad at me and told me that I overstep and I had no idea how much Kai changed his life around for the kids and how he was doing everything he could to take care of them properly.\n\nIn the car my husband told me that I went too far, especially when we know how stressed and anxious Kai was when they first had the kids. I think that I was just giving my point of view and helping them for the future.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I am literally at my computer from 830am until 5pm when I leave to go get my kids from daycare. Having someone watch your kids or sending your kids to daycare is good parenting.

You know kids LEARN through play, right? Their \u201cjob\u201d is to have fun. That is literally how their brain is wired.

Discipline them all day???\n\nYou have SO much to learn about parenting. They\u2019re doing freaking amazing. Balance IS necessary or you get burned out and it\u2019s not good for your kids either.

God, you are insufferable. \"Oh I have nieces and nephews so I know how to parent kids\" is a joke of a statement. You aren't a parent because you aren't parenting any kids. You are babysitting. You get to send your nieces and nephews home when you are done watching them. Kai and Luke have to wake up in the middle of the night, nurse them through illnesses, and live with their kids every day. \n\nSo what if they have a nanny? Kai and Luke still rearranged their lives for their kids. That makes them good parents and what they are doing is parenting. Kai is spending quality time with his kids and not treating his kids like a set but spending quality one-on-one time with each of them. What does it matter to you that he wants to spend quality time and take them to fun places? He wants his kids to have happy memories together. You complain about them having a nanny when he works from home but working from home still means working. Honestly, Kai sounds like a great hands-on dad.

It serves many purposes: kids are entertained, parents don't have to constantly be keeping the kids busy at home, keepd them off svreens,and it helps tire the little one out for a good night's sleep.\n\nThey sound like wonderful parents.

Who the hell are you to tell them how to parent or that there doing it wrong!?! Being around kids doesn't give you the insight or the right to say things like that. Shame on you!

Exactly what business is it of yours?
