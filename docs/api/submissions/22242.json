I\u2019m a girl and they\u2019re usually just misogynistic assholes to me.\n\nWith my brother it\u2019s a bit different. They treat him like a bro until he does things they don\u2019t like. My brother\u2019s 18 now and he got into a good college. He graduated with really good grades and has an athletic scholarship on top of everything. Except the sport is \u201cgay\u201d to them so it\u2019s nothing to be proud about.\n\nMy brother also has quite a few tattoos and piercings. These friends of my sister have tattoos as well but for some reason they think my brother looks stupid. He doesn\u2019t, his are much nicer than theirs.\n\nThen to top it all off, my brother came out as bisexual. He\u2019s not ashamed of it and doesn\u2019t care if people know but he really didn\u2019t want these guys to find out. But they did. My sister swears she didn\u2019t tell them and we want to believe her, it\u2019s just that how else would they have found out? \n\nShe promised to talk to them so that they don\u2019t say any crap about it.\n\nAnyways, one of my dad\u2019s friends invited us to a dinner party. Unfortunately, one of the trashy assholes were invited as well. \n\nHe immediately started making fun of my brother for being an attention seeker. He said he finally figured out my brother, he\u2019s clearly an attention seeker. He said, \u201cthe piercings, the tattoos, and bisexual? Not even just gay\u2014but bisexual? I\u2019ve never even heard of that! Clearly you\u2019re deprived of something. I know! Want me to talk to ur dad for you? I thought he was pretty involved but your behaviour suggests the opposite...\u201d \n\nMy brother and I were kinda lost for words. Like\u2026 okay\u2026 ? My brother started laughing and I was like \u201c?? You\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about this haven\u2019t you?\u201c \n\nHe was like what no I was just uhh uhh. I responded to that with \u201cuhh uhh thinking about my brother? That\u2019s a bit\u2026\u201d\n\nThere were two girls with us that started giggling and you could just see this guy turning red. He told me to stfu before stomping off. My sister immediately rolled her eyes AT ME and said \u201chow mature.\u201d \n\nI thought that was the end of it but apparently this guy wants me to apologize to him in person and my sister keeps asking me to because I embarrassed him so it\u2019s only fair. Um?? No??

Bonus points for turning the humiliation he was trying to visit on your brother back on him.", "NTA. Great way to stand for your brother. Yo: Do not dare to apologize haha \n\nSeems both you and your brother were overcoming their comments quietly, so why the fuss on their end?", "Definitely NTA.  Homophobia is for very weak-minded people.  Your sister, however, is the AH here (and obviously her \"friend\").  What kind of sister stands up for some dumb redneck over her own little brother?  I think the whole \"low contact\" thing gets thrown around on here way more than it should, but in this case, I'd probably stay far away from her for a good long while.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry I pointed out how weirdly obsessed you are with my brother.\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA, what a clever way to just shut him down. I loved the other commenter who talked about \u201csorry for ruining you talking about your crush\u201d. So funny. \n\nBut the way your sister rolled her eyes at your comment.

He had the wedding to your brother all planned! Now however he must contend with not only other males but pesky females as well - must be a heavy weight on the poor soul.
