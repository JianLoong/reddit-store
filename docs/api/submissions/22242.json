It\u2019s only like these 3 guys that are trashy though but they don\u2019t treat my sister very kindly so idk why she hangs out with them.\n\nThey don\u2019t like me or my brother. I\u2019m a girl and they\u2019re usually just misogynistic assholes to me.\n\nWith my brother it\u2019s a bit different. They treat him like a bro until he does things they don\u2019t like. My brother\u2019s 18 now and he got into a good college. He graduated with really good grades and has an athletic scholarship on top of everything. Except the sport is \u201cgay\u201d to them so it\u2019s nothing to be proud about.\n\nMy brother also has quite a few tattoos and piercings. These friends of my sister have tattoos as well but for some reason they think my brother looks stupid. He doesn\u2019t, his are much nicer than theirs.\n\nThen to top it all off, my brother came out as bisexual. He\u2019s not ashamed of it and doesn\u2019t care if people know but he really didn\u2019t want these guys to find out. But they did. My sister swears she didn\u2019t tell them and we want to believe her, it\u2019s just that how else would they have found out? \n\nShe promised to talk to them so that they don\u2019t say any crap about it.\n\nAnyways, one of my dad\u2019s friends invited us to a dinner party. Unfortunately, one of the trashy assholes were invited as well. \n\nHe immediately started making fun of my brother for being an attention seeker. He said he finally figured out my brother, he\u2019s clearly an attention seeker. He said, \u201cthe piercings, the tattoos, and bisexual? Not even just gay\u2014but bisexual? I\u2019ve never even heard of that! Clearly you\u2019re deprived of something. I know! Want me to talk to ur dad for you? I thought he was pretty involved but your behaviour suggests the opposite...\u201d \n\nMy brother and I were kinda lost for words. Like\u2026 okay\u2026 ? My brother started laughing and I was like \u201c?? You\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about this haven\u2019t you?\u201c \n\nHe was like what no I was just uhh uhh. I responded to that with \u201cuhh uhh thinking about my brother? That\u2019s a bit\u2026\u201d\n\nThere were two girls with us that started giggling and you could just see this guy turning red. He told me to stfu before stomping off. My sister immediately rolled her eyes AT ME and said \u201chow mature.\u201d \n\nI thought that was the end of it but apparently this guy wants me to apologize to him in person and my sister keeps asking me to because I embarrassed him so it\u2019s only fair.
