He chose to chuck all the work he did raising you in the trash in order to feed his need to have sex with new people that weren't your mom. He made it worse when he stood by when his new sex buddy treated you like shit even though you didn't do anything to deserve that. You forgave him and moved on from his infidelity. He abused that forgiveness.\n\nIt's particularly rich of the wife to say she has done anything but abuse you and rob you of both financial resources (of having a two parent family) as well as emotional support and security.\n\nSo yes, you have been put in the position of having to grieve the loss of someone who is, for all intents and purposes, dead. Not only that, but you have to do that emotional labour in the most hurtful of ways. His \"death\" was a choice he made and continues to make every single day. Unlike a regular death, that's a huge amount of extra weight on you and it's really lonely work.\n\nThe most astonishing thing: he knows what he's doing because the same damn thing happened to him.\n\n\"He and his 2nd wife died trying to kill me\" would not be an inaccurate addition to your story.", "NTA. Good for you. Parents don't get to just abandon their children and pretend it is all good. You'll have even more resentment, if and when, you become a parent. My dad moved when I was about 14. It wrecked me and my sister. Destroyed our very fragile selves. I'm 28, and still deal with it. But it got worse for me once I had my son. I look at him and every day I just don't understand how my dad could ever leave me. \n\nI'm really sorry, OP. I'm sorry for all of us who's parents just dipped. It's fucked up and completely unfair. The selfishness of the parents who do this just blows my mind. \n\nIf you're not already, I highly suggest getting into some therapy. Your past will follow you forever if you don't learn how to deal with it. You deserve to be happy and not angry or sad. Therapy has helped me immensely. When I first started, I could barely talk about what happened. I repressed so much of those emotions that it bled into every aspect of my life.

Easy. \n\nI have also had people pull the \u201cbut he\u2019s your dad\u201d card on me when I mention I am NC. I don\u2019t give a flying fuck. He didn\u2019t parent me, he\u2019s not a dad.

I think it\u2019s obvious that your dad sucks, so I won\u2019t get into that. \n\nBut as someone whose dad is literally dead, like not alive anymore, parent loss is a very painful and specific kind of loss and grief (especially for someone your age). And it\u2019s not interchangeable with betrayal or estrangement or abandonment\u2014which are painful, but still not the same thing.\n\nMost people don\u2019t know how to hold space for those grieving the death of a loved one unless they\u2019ve been through it themselves. So when I meet someone who tells me their dad is dead, I\u2019m going to relate to them as someone who gets this very taboo and difficult part of my life, a part even my closest friends don\u2019t fully understand. If you tell me your dad is dead and I think I can connect with you on that level, only to find out you were conflating abandonment and betrayal with my experience, that would really fucking hurt and I would probably keep you at an emotional distance moving forward.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that what you\u2019ve been through isn\u2019t painful in its own rite, or that I wouldn\u2019t have empathy for it. And if you\u2019d been saying \u201cMy dad is dead to me,\u201d I would understand that, even if the choice of words might sting a little. But just as my dad didn\u2019t abandon or betray me by dying\u2014and conflating his death with those actions would be bad for my mental health\u2014your dad didn\u2019t actually die. And thinking of it that way is distancing yourself from what he did do, which is abandon and betray and hurt you. \n\nPretending he\u2019s dead might make it easier to deal with for now, but I think you\u2019re doing yourself a disservice long-term by using euphemisms to refer to him and the very real pain he\u2019s caused. The fact is that he will die at some point, and all the painful emotions you\u2019ve evaded by putting him in a mental casket will resurface to be dealt with. And I really don\u2019t want that for you, or anyone, because avoiding the emotional truth of your situation can and will steal years of your life. So as much as what he\u2019s done hurts to think about it now, it will only deepen and worsen with time and avoidance.\n\nAt minimum, I would ask that you start saying he\u2019s dead *to me* so that you\u2019re not misrepresenting your experiences to vulnerable, grieving people. But for your own sake, I hope you can explore other ways of framing this for yourself in therapy\u2014ways that honor what you\u2019ve been through and help you face it and integrate it so that, when his actual death comes, you won\u2019t have decades of repressed pain to contend with in addition to whatever complicated feelings his legitimate death inspires.", "NTA \nThe reason your paternal grandmother is immediately on your side is (1) because everything you have said is both valid and justified and (2) she is probably so hurt that she raised a man that turned out just like his miserable dad - your grandpa who also abandoned his family and started a new one \n\nThe sad thing is that your Dad doesn\u2019t realize what he\u2019s done, he should understand EXACTLY what you\u2019re going through and why you\u2019re angry/saying he\u2019s dead.

Tell people 'we are no contact' and if they demand an explanation etc just say 'I'm not looking for feedback about my decision.'", "And that very response you gave would be excellent for OP to use.", "The Narcissist's Prayer\n\nThat didn't happen. And if it did, it wasn't that bad. And if it was, that's not a big deal. And if it is, that's not my fault. And if it was, I didn't mean it. And if I did, you deserved it.", "No, but people might wonder what you're hiding and what else you might lie about. It doesn't matter if all the personal stuff makes it hard for you, for an outsider your words are a flippant disregard towards someone else's ability to trust you.\n\nI knew a guy like that once. Could never pin down who he was ever talking about because that stuff shifted very easily and the most important thing I took away from it was that what if one day he was talking about me?\n\nWe're not colourful background characters in someone's life we're people and that sense of detachment comes across as cold, if not a bit psychopathic. Again, we don't have to know all the odds and ends in another person's life or be expected to be told them, but there's a certain line where someone's break with reality stops being something to be ignored and can be a reason for people to create some of their own distance.", "NTA his dead to you. You should have immediately call them out and address how crazy it is they know how a phone works since they apparently didn\u2019t for years.", "Nta. Wow. I thought i would be going differently on this one. Nope. What sealed it for me (along w the graduation crap) was \"I'm a brat and ungrateful for everything they've done for me and that I shouldn't be saying that because he tried to parent as best he could.' \nUngrateful for what?!? What have they done besides abandon you? Make promises to be there then go on vacation but call & congratulate you like its nothing?  And if thats the best he/they can parent, they def shouldn't be having more kids. They are absurd. Sounds like they want $ from grandma (or something like free babysitting) & are worried she will see them for the snakes they are", "NTA. If you feel like responding, flat out ask what \u201cthey\u2019ve\u201d ever done for you, you haven\u2019t even met his new family lol.\n\nJust promise yourself that if you ever have kids you\u2019ll break the cycle and not abandon them.", "NTA block block block. Alternatively tell her to eat shit and then block.", "NTA.\nMy dad left when I was 10 and I've not seen him since (now 39). He has never called, sent cards/presents or visited after first few months and that was only to save face with his family.\n\nHe is dead to me, no idea if he is alive or not TBH. Everyone understands that, my dad is gone. Fortunately for me he was pretty useless and horrid so I'm not missing anything for you it will hurt more as you are missing a good dad. But he had his chance and chose his new wife over you. If his parents see him differently knowing the truth that's on him. You are under no obligation to forgive or forget what they have done.\n\nLive your best life, with or without them it's your choice. Do better if you choose to have kids - unlike him, you can learn from his mistakes. Enjoy your life with people that really love you.", "I'm gonna say this as someone who's dad HAS died, so you understand what it's like from the other side.\n\nESH\n\nObviously we know why your dad sucks. But you suck because yes, you're going through pain and I get that he's 'dead to you', but it's not the same. It's not the same as never being able to ask him anything again. It's not the same as having that fleeting thought of something you'd love to show him, and realizing there is no physical way you ever could. It's not the same as picking up a picture of him and realizing you'll never see his face again. \n\nThese are all things you CAN do, but are choosing not to. But saying your dad died is so different, and honestly I'm already tearing up writing this so I don't feel I can explain more.\n\nFind a different way to say it. Even \"He is dead to me\" is better. But saying he died is harmful to those of us who HAVE lost our dads.", "INFO  Just what has \"dad\" and his wife done for you(after age 15/16)\n\nDid they pay for college? Buy you a car?  Provide anything other than court ordered child support?", "\"I get fewer pitying looks when I say you died than I do when I try to explain how you abandoned me for your affair partner and chose to miss all of the milestones in the last 8 years of my life.\"\n\nNTA", "Ugh, you\u2019re describing my dad. NTA\n\nPiece of advice: Don\u2019t apologise to keep the peace. You won\u2019t feel any better. I\u2019ve been there.\n\nAlso, you should tell him how you really feel because when he gets too old you don\u2019t want to be blamed if he is sick ends up worse or \u201cmake him sick\u201d. I regret not telling my dad how I really feel and now I don\u2019t want to be blamed for his death if I actually tell how he\u2019s failed completely as a father.", "nta - you deserve better and they deserve no more chances", "NTA.

Please choose you.  Choose your happiness, your peace of mind, your self-respect, your self-worth.  Speak your truth.  Say what feels right.  And don't apologize for that.  \n\nThe dad from your childhood doesn't exist anymore.  He's gone.  Now it's time as an adult life to do whatever brings you peace and happiness.  You owe him NOTHING.  He had a beautiful chance to have the most incredible loving relationship with you - and he threw that away.  You would have loved him more than anything - but he was so selfish and toxic he didn't appreciate your love as his kid.  (Which is the sweetest love in the world.)  That totally sucks - but at least you see the truth of who he is.    \n\n\nIt's okay to stop considering his feelings, his needs and his wants.  He doesn't deserve your consideration or empathy after his years of emotional neglect and toxic non-present-parenting.  \n\n***Blocking and giving boundaries to assholes is one of the best forms of self-love out there!***  Good luck.", "NTA.

At least if hes dead people wont automatically assume hes a shit weasel. He should be thankfull for the out.\n\nNTA", "\"If that's really the best parent you can be, then you should probably abandon your new child now before they grow attached.\"", "besides her 'dad' as she knew him is dead, he is not there anymore. it's just someone else walking around in the spermdonor's body. and you're right on point, saying he is dead will get way less awkward, annoying and downright insensitive questions.", "\"this was also done before the divorce, so glad to see you're still not listening\"", "I'm sorry you're stuck with two psychos. I hope you've gotten out, or at least can get out soon. \n\nI got lucky with a good mom. It's just my sperm donor that's a real narcissist.

I think I might email my sperm donor with this at some point for a laugh.", "NTA.  Truth is a bitch and has a long memory.", "So my father abused me my entire life & about 5 years ago, I cut him off. It was easier for me to tell people that he died bc people asked too many questions if I said the truth - he was abusive and I didn\u2019t want a relationship with him. I was tired of hearing \u201coh well, he\u2019s still your dad, you should love him anyway\u201d, ya da ya da.\nHonestly, if he didn\u2019t want me telling people he was dead, he shouldn\u2019t have done allllll the horrible things he did to me for my entire life, which caused me to tell people that he was dead. \n\nAnyway, fast forward to a month ago: he actually died. so then I had to explain that he did die 5 years ago\u2026.. to me. I had grieved him and our relationship years ago, and knew that I would never speak to that man again bc there was no possibility of redemption or reconciliation.

Your grandmother is only seeing him for what he truly is now and no one can be blamed for that but him. ATP entertaining him and evil s/m is a waste of your time. I suggest sending one last message expressing the hurt he has caused you and how you are completely severely ties to him, and that if others ask where your father is you will continue to respond with \u201che is dead\u201d. Ofc this is only a suggestion and whatever you do plan to do I hope gives you piece of mind and a chance to live the rest of your life happily.", "You are not an AH for being hurt that your father has repeatedly abandoned and disrespected you.
