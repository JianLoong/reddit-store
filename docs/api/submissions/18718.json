I get why you think that- 100%- but it is misleading to claim he died when you can simply say \" we don't have a relationship\".  \" My father is dead to me\". \" We are estranged\". \nTo say someone died is going to elicit a specific type of sympathy- that of not having any control over the end of another person's biological life. You may tell someone your dad is dead and they may then say \" oh I'm sorry, my dad passed away too\" and then find that by you not being factual has made them feel vulnerable, and that you weren't honest with them. In a way, it cheapens the grief and sympathy of actual death. \nWhile it is reasonable and justified for you to choose to cut your father out of your life and think of him as you do, it's also a choice. Your father actually dying isn't a choice you made, and you don't have that power. Words matter.

I completely understand your feelings, it is fine WITHIN your family, but just be conscious of how it will land beyond the family.
