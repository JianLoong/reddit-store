However, you're leaving out a lot of background information, so all we can really see here is you're an adult, and you don't like your sibling who is a teenager, and you have no desire to be around him at all.\n\nBased strictly on that, I say NAH. You don't have any obligation towards your sibling, but your mom isn't being unreasonable asking you to help now and then while she works and does her classes.\n\nIf you have more details or you want to clarify your reasoning, I'd be willing to change my answer accordingly. Best wishes, OP.", "NTA.\n\nNot your kid, not your problem.  You don't have a relationship now and no desire to start one, and \"No.\" is a complete sentence.  You're an adult in your 20's, you have no need to justify not wanting a relationship with him and you're not an AH for not wanting one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If it\u2019s the latter, do you pay full rent and buy your own groceries? \n\nIf you are totally independent and live outside the home then NTA, but if you are still fully or partially dependant on your mother at 25, then you should be helping supervising your younger brother so your mother can improve the household finances by education.", ">my mom didn't want me to have much to do with him since she thought I would have been a bad influence.\n\nFunny how now she demands that you babysit him. \n\nAs someone who isn't interessed in her 2 years younger half sister from mom's second marriage, NTA.", "You\u2019re NTA for not wanting to watch your half brother. But you are TA for not wanting to help your mom out.", "NTA. She doesn't want you to have a relationship with your half brother, she wants you as a free baby sitter. And you don't have to do that. She should look into having a babysitter/houskeeper for the days she is not able to be there, theach your half brother to make his own food or put him in extraculicum classes so he has somewhere to go in the afternoons.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust refuse to parent HER kid.", "INFO Why does a 13-year-old need a babysitter? Sure, they can't pay bills or ~~storm the capitol~~ vote, but unless you've really screwed up, a 13-year-old should be pretty damn independent. They should be able to cook their own dinner, clean up after themselves, and call a trusted adult or 9-1-1 if there's an emergency.\n\nWhether or not you have a relationship with your half brother is another matter, but a 13-year-old shouldn't need a minder. The kid probably ignores you and goes back to doing his homework or playing video games anyway.", "The child in the post is 13.

OP had specifically volunteered the information that their mother had said that, but gave absolutely no context as to why. But that's why I gave the answer that I did, because there's so little contextual information.\n\nMy mom didn't like leaving me alone with my younger sibling when I was a troubled teen, and I know NOW as an adult that her reasons were valid, even if I didn't understand them at the time. We don't know enough about the situation to really decide what the right answer is here.", "Unless there's some kind of special needs situation going on, I guess.\n\nI have a fairly standard (on the smart/nerdy end) 12yo boy and if left unsupervised all day/evening, he will... eat Nutella when he's not supposed to, and stay up too late to play video games.", "The right answer is that op doesn't have to babysit his half brother. Since he is a bad influence, well why should he babysit her precious kid?"]}
