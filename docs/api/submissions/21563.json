And if you contribute less than $400 most of the time, it is a bargain, I suppose. That being said, I totally get your perspective. If I was paying rent that was very nearly the market standard, I would probably be less inclined to want to spend on relationship maintenance myself as the nature of it changes almost entirely. It would be different if you both agreed at the beginning and whatnot, obviously. \n\nIt all comes down to trust and it sounds as if there is not a lot of that. Kind of yikes. Hopefully it all works out.", "NTA, your arguments make sense, either you get on the deed and the \"ownership\" shares get adjusted depending on how much who will pay over the lifetime of the mortgage, or you need to find a completely new unit where both of you would be on equal footing property-rights-wise.", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn't have spent a dime renovating his place.

If you were to break up, he would retain that investment and you\u2019d have lost it. \n\nIn your shoes, I would propose this: you pay an equal amount monthly into a longterm savings account (the kind you can\u2019t easily withdraw from). So by the end of the period of living in the apartment (or at the end of the relationship) you each will have significant savings. In that way, you\u2019d be contributing to your joint future together to the same degree as he is.", "Very light YTA.\n\nYou had a chance to put your foot down and say you didn't want to be in the loop for a commitment like that in a manner that didn't let him invest in such a thing. After 10 years you should feel confident enough to stand your ground on such a lifestyle defining decision. If you split today you could claim equity in the assset despite not being on the deed in most countries due to de facto laws and you would get monetary value. It's not unreasonable to contribute, if anything you contributing is providing even more proof of equity which is not a bad thing at all.

On the other hand he sees you living with him and not paying anything as total money saving move for you. In short, you both feel taken advantage of. \n\nThe solution from this redditor\u2019s perspective: \n\n1. Buy a new place together so you can both build equity in something. Obviously this only works if you guys have long term plans to commit to the relationship, which sounds to be the case. If he doesn\u2019t agree, then that is on him, but you are offering to pay half of the mortgage in a new and maybe bigger place.", "YTA. Move out and buy/rent on your own.

You got not wanting to pay rent.\n\nIf he is purchasing a home for both of you, your input and finances count.  If you both planned to buy and he bought on his own, it's kind of a dick move and kind of validates your point just a little, but not completely.\n\nYou also should absolutely be paying rent.  Maybe not as much as he's asking for, but still you need to pay your way.\n\nYou can fix this though.  Draw up a contract where he pays you back the $5,000 should you separate.  That will give you enough to get out without having to save up or couch surf.  Get your name on the deed and mortgage.  You are contributing to that, you planned to buy together, he shouldn't balk at that.  Then agree to pay him rent or half the mortgage payment.  Do not pay for anything else for the house like repairs or new appliances.  \n\nIf you do separate, he still gets to keep the apartment, but he has to buy you out of your share.

This is how your relationship is, you\u2019re not married, your finances are separate, and you shouldn\u2019t get to live somewhere for free. \n\nIf you want a different kind of relationship, ie married with combined lives and finances, then you should talk to him about that.\n\nTBH I just don\u2019t get it when people in long term relationships make these big decisions just for themselves. \u201cVague\u201d plan to get married in 10 years when you\u2019ve already been together for 10 years?

Bottom line, he shouldn't have to be paying your bills if he doesn't want to, and he doesn't want to anymore.\n\nAccusing *him* of wanting his cake and eating it too when you've been living rent and mortgage free for over a year? Looks like you're the hypocrite there.", "Nah- because of your help with renovation you have contributed 277 per month you have been living there, that's significant.  Its reasonable to share some cost but his claim he could rent out the space is kind of wild.  He is providing a space to live- that isn't worthless even if its not ideal.   One of the above suggestions about putting the 'rent' amount into a shared savings seems like an excellent solution that solves the equity problem", "yta,.. you should help with the payments.\n\nIf you marry, then have of that studio will be yours anyway, (its not a Premarital asset yet until the morgage is fully paid), and if you dont, then you didnt take advantage of your bf supporting you and you were an adult and helped pay the bills.\n\nHe is not an ah for wanting you to chip in the expenses, I think its wrong for you to call it rent /landlord dynamics.", "YTA - simply put, youre an AH for thinking you get to live somewhere for free.", "ESH. I doubt you won't have any tenant protection but that depends on the country n region you live in. The reasonable approach would be for you to get on equity n mortgage which isn't discussed.", "YTA\n\nSounds like a load of BS on your end. You don't have \"mainly separate\" finances when he's been paying your living expenses for a year and a half. You've been freeloading and balk the second he wants you to contribute fairly.\n\nThere's so many ways to go about it fairly but you don't want that. You don't want to pay your fair share. You want him to keep paying your rent and bills. You never had to move in if you didn't want to. You chose to and you should be paying.", "YTA. You should contribute to the bills too. He\u2019s not asking for an unreasonable amount. A majority of what he\u2019s paying is not going to the equity, which is the only thing he actually benefits from. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why paying a small amount of rent each month would suddenly make it where you guys can\u2019t treat each other. \n\nI also don\u2019t understand how you thinking he\u2019s trying to make money off you when you\u2019ve been benefiting from living with him without having to pay anything for a while now.", "INFO: How do your incomes compare? Is one of you now making significantly more than the other?", "YTA. So you think you should just live for free on someone else\u2019s dime? Contribute nothing financially to the relationship? Maybe don\u2019t count on that future/marriage plan.", "I see both of your points so NAH I guess? I\u2019m not sure. \n\nHow would you feel about sharing the property tax, insurance and other costs that are not the actual mortgage? That way you would contribute. \n\nYou should also consider the legal implications. Depending on where you live he might be able to kick you out any time. So paying rent and setting up a rental agreement might give you more legal security. Also once you are a legal tenant please don\u2019t pay towards any renovations/handyman work etc as this is a landlord\u2019s duty. \n\nHow is your income? Does anyone earn significantly more than the other? I\u2019m wondering why he came up with this after 1.5 years and nit earlier so maybe something has changed. \n\nI really really understand both of you so I can\u2019t label either of you an AH. Hopefully you can come up with a solution. It could be you paying towards other expenses like tax as mentioned above. Or start a separate saving fund where you pay like 200-300 per month and any repairs or improvements come out of this fund. Just tossing in another creative solution", "Both of you have valid points. Your concern is paying for something that, in the end, you will have no claim to in the even things should go wrong between you. Have him put your name on the deed AND ON THE MORTGAGE. Then you each pay half of all utilities going forward. The downside to this is the amount of money he paid toward the mortgage before this subject came up. He would have a right to claim half of those moneys in backpayments from you.", "YTA", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain on this one, a bit. \n\nYou should pay something more than you are, but you\u2019re NTA for not wanting to pay what he\u2019s asking, especially without legal protections. If you\u2019re going to be a tenant, you need a legally binding lease. Also, as soon as you invested in the property/ added to his equity, you deserved a legal agreement detailing how you\u2019d be paid that money + any percentage increase in property value back, either at the end of the relationship, or the sale of the property. Otherwise, you should not be paying for any improvements on the property that stay with the property/ would typically be the property owner\u2019s responsibility/ increase the property\u2019s value.\n\nI will say this again for the 2nd time in 2 days: I am not against a partner who owns a home charging rent to their SO to live there. This exceeds the limits of being reasonable though. Rent has to come with a legally binding lease agreement, and should not equal more than 1/2 the monthly interest payments on the property. If a romantic partner is contributing to equity payments (or improvements) on the property, there needs to be a legally binding agreement for how they recoup that money + a percentage of the property value increase, at the end of the relationship or sale of the property. \n\nIf your BF is your landlord, he is responsible for all renovations and fixtures that stay with the unit as well. It\u2019s reasonable for him to ask you to pay more than a portion of utilities at this point. This is too much. He also owes you the money back for the renovations you paid for. \n\nHonestly, if he isn\u2019t willing to make an adjustment to reflect a fair amount, as well as get a legal agreement drafted and signed that protects the equity investments you\u2019ve already made in the property and may make in the future, I\u2019d suggest moving out. It\u2019s better spending more money on a share, and having your rights protected, live in a place where you can sleep well, and not feel like your boyfriend is milking you for more than a fair amount on a property you did not want.", "YTA. \"It feels like trying to make money off me which leaves a bad taste in my mouth\", seriously? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I would be paying half his mortgage but with no right to the home and no tenant protections\": have a discussion with him, and work on this, but I'm afraid he's the only one being remotely reasonable here.", "NTA - regardless of everything else, your last point is the only one that's relevant. He can't actually rent the place out to anyone else which ties in with your third point about him trying to make money off you. Should you be paying half of the bills? Absolutely. But you would literally be paying half of his mortgage, money that he couldn't get from anyone else, and you would have no financial stake in the property.", "A landlord usually doesn\u2019t expect you to share a bed with him in a studio.", "She paid \u20ac5000 in decoration costs, and the place was bought 1.5 years ago. That alone ends up being \u20ac277/month for the time they've lived there.", "I'm not sure I agree with your AH judgement but I love the last paragraph, such a good suggestion :)", "I\u2019d agree with you if neither party owned the place and it was just both paying rent; however, she would be helping him build equity in an asset that she has no claim to.", "Glad it wasn\u2019t just me who went straight to the calculator! Think it\u2019s worth having a proper chat and maybe getting a solicitor involved. He owns it but you\u2019ve invested. You\u2019ve been together a long time and you have different finances but if you want to stay together then you have a lot of logistics to work out. I lean to NAH. You should have worked this all out before you spent anything on the property.", "For clarification, in this country if you're a \"live-in tenant\" (the landlord lives on the premises), you have no rights at all. No entitlement to a notice period or anything like that. (And no right to privacy but that's irrelevant in a studio apartment lol).", "Right now, I make 39k and he makes 52k. Until last month I made 18k (PhD stipend).\n\nI am applying for jobs in the 60k+ range though.", "The OP splits all the other costs including repairs and contributed 5k to renovate and furnish the place. \n\nSo I think it\u2019s unfair to say she lives for free and contributes nothing.", "To clarify - yes, my income recently changed as I finished my PhD and started a job, so I went from earning a very low stipend to an ok (but lower than his) salary.", "Her concern is only valid if she\u2019s paying higher rent than she would elsewhere.", "They can theoretically just split the ownership portions unequally to reflect that he paid more.", "Sharing a bed doesn't mean you get free rent. My wife still pays half our rent bill and she shares a bed with me.", "She wouldn\u2019t have a claim to anything if she was renting a regular place either though, like a regular landlord situation. She\u2019s not ready to buy so realistically she would be paying rent somewhere, and she\u2019s getting a significant discount by living with him. She shouldn\u2019t have equity in the home, she didn\u2019t actually put money for a down payment, they have separate finances, and she is still getting a great deal. She should try living somewhere else and gaining equity on a place she didn\u2019t buy and see how that goes.", "The equity thing is always the big sticking point and I've come to think that people look at this situation one of two ways:\n\n1. What's the amount of money you are paying per month\n2. What is the impact to your net worth month over month\n\nPersonally I've come think of the latter as more fair, though the math is harder.  However much the partner who owns the place is paying towards principal on the loan each month shouldn't really be included in the calculation of what is fair because they aren't losing any value there, it's just being converted into another form.", "Which he can't make any money off of from anybody else. I mean, it's not as if he can advertise for another housemate. Can you imagine the advert \"Studio apartment, shared bathroom, shared kitchen, shared bed\"?", "No, because if she were to rent she would also be able to choose the place she's paying for. She had no say in this studio apartment.", "Surely you understand that if they were both renting, splitting rent would be fair, but the fact that the boyfriend owns the condo changes the situation drastically. \n\nImagine for instance she pays half the mortgage for several years, plus renovations which she has already paid for and the boyfriend sells the condo for a profit. Does OP get any of that profit? No. Is the boyfriend out any money other than the interest on the loan, which may be offset by the proceeds from the sale?

One where 10 years in your partner says things to you like \u201csubsidize your life?\u201d He wants to turn your relationship into a business arrangement (more than it already possibly seems to be?) imo and that\u2019s wrong. Relationships shouldn\u2019t be pennypinched. Not the question you asked, but I\u2019d be worried about the \u201cin sickness and health\u201d part of a relationship with someone who has that mindset. \n\nI think your arguments are fair. This is a studio. It\u2019s unrealistic of him to think he could have a roommate there paying that much. And turning a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship into a landlord/tenant one *would* change the dynamic. I\u2019d also feel a bit weird about paying rent to my boyfriend, let alone my boyfriend who *owned the home*. To which people would say \u201cit\u2019s not different than renting.\u201d I\u2019d rather rent. Perhaps you would too?\n\nI think, should you both decide this makes sense, splitting bills and whatnot 50/50 works. I believe the mortgage should be on him, he bought this place for himself. If he cannot afford it without a roommate, he should look into that instead of trying to make that person be you. You\u2019ve spent 5k decorating it and you have no claim to it. That\u2019s more than fair.\n\nYou\u2019re being put in a weird situation here. If you want to live with him, it HAS to be in the place he\u2019s bought, and he wants \u20ac400 a month in rent from you for it. If you don\u2019t agree to this, then you move out, which probably ends the relationship.", "Sell it and buy a bigger place together?", "The scenario you mention is exactly the trap most women fall into. They stay with a man for years in \"his\" house and then the woman gets turfed out because the man finds a younger model or the man wants to punish the woman for something she has done. In the mean time, house prices have gone up and you can no longer afford your own place without a downpayment. \n\nYou are paying his mortgage yet you are building no equity.

I feel it would be fair to clear out who owns the what, ie, the studio would be entirely HIS asset. \n\nFor this to happen I think he should owe you the approximate ~5k that you have put in (this can be done by him minusing ~300 for rent per month). Of course utilities will still be split. \n\nI do find it slightly odd that your bf opted to buy property now and is subsiding the costs by potentially charging you rent. But when you are the one who buys property this cannot be returned. \n\nI would suggest living separately (and seeing if someone would actually stay in a bunk bed with your bf which I did find hilarious). If staying separately helps your longer term goal of saving as much as possible to buy property then do that, because it feels slightly premeditated of your bf to do this. \n\nAnd also I think the bigger issue here is just your views differ in this regard. If you were the own who owned the place you probably wouldn\u2019t have charged him the rent.

I just don\u2019t understand how him buying property wasn\u2019t more of a discussion before the fact, and why he was so dead set on buying a place she wasn\u2019t interested if he did in fact want her to live with him? It\u2019s his money, but are they are or are they not trying to build a life together in their partnership, regardless of marital status? It just seems like the kind of unilateral decision making that one shouldn\u2019t be making when their planning on a future with another person. And the lack of discussion about rent and equity and how this whole thing would work BEFORE moving in just tells me these two are just flying by the seat of their pants, doing whats convenient for themselves individually without considering eachother or long term goals together. If I wanted my partner of 8 years to continue to be my partner and live with me, buying a home would be a much bigger issue than \u201cWell I like this one, I\u2019m gonna get it and you can live here or not, you don\u2019t have to like it\u2026 oh by the way pay me rent though\u201d Like wtf is this relationship?", "Wouldn\u2019t that be what we do with every landlord???", "You mean, like paying rent to a third party landlord?", "Yes but not paying any rent would be him paying for her living expenses and affording her the chance to save for a deposit for a property which he may not have any ownership over in the future. If she lived elsewhere she\u2019d be paying a lot more in rent and not saving so much for a deposit, so him supporting them both like this without any contribution from her is him possibly setting her up for a future and they might even break up before he gets any benefit from this. \n\nIt\u2019s like when I lived at home with my parents rent free in order to save money for a deposit. He is not her parent and there\u2019s no reason why he should be paying her way. \n\nIf she makes a reasonable (below market rent) contribution for her living expenses then he\u2019s benefiting by earning equity and she\u2019s benefiting from the opportunity to save the money she would have otherwise spent on market rate rent elsewhere.
