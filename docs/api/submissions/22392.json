OP owns the spot.  He can have the opinion that OP is an AH for charging.  That's fair. He can also decline and continue to park on the street.

Even a neighbor should not have to give away something that belongs to them.", "OP is under no obligation to provide his property as extra space for the neighbor to use for free.
