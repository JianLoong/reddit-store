However, we should start blaming the individuals who work for those airlines and they allow inconsiderate passengers to intimidate others into giving up their seats.

I always choose the window because I don't like to get up during the flight nor do I want to be interrupted to have to get up.

I suggest they swap with someone from the other row- they\u2019ll have more success that way.   I\u2019ve had a few people get indignant.  But I don\u2019t give in.  Don\u2019t feel bad for standing up for yourself.", "NTA and I would inform a flight attendant of this situation as well. The entitlement of some parents is beyond me.", "NTA. Odd case though, few would say the aisle seat costs less than the window seat. In other words you were getting a fair deal, didn't mind helping the little girl and so your father was butting in when there actually was no need.

If her father wanted her in a window seat, he should have paid for it.", "NTA.  Tired of entities parents.  I\u2019d never give up my window seat.

You don't need to, and shouldn't be expected to, explain *anything* outside of saying that that is your seat, end of story.", "NTA there's a reason you can reserve your seat. It's to be able to reserve your seat. The same option was available to the jerk in the aisle seat when he booked.", "NTA. WTF is up with people trying to cheap out when they KNOW they want a paid seat. Fuck those people!", "NTA the kid's dad is a total ah", "NTA- You should be sitting in  the seat you paid for, and the father was being the ass.", "NTA. Its your seat.

Check in 24 hours ahead. Get a letter /number boarding assignment.

Just sit in your assigned seat or pay extra for the window.", "NTA. The father was hoping you'd be intimidated by him and back down, or that he could shame you into conceding your seat to him. If he wanted his child to have a window seat then he should have booked one beforehand, it's that simple. I get that you might feel bad about asserting your right to your seat because standing up for yourself can feel weirdly shitty sometimes, especially if the other party acts like they've somehow been wronged. Take it from a horde of random internet strangers, you did absolutely nothing wrong, the father and his kid are the ones who behaved poorly. People do this kind of thing a lot on planes, they don't plan ahead and then try to take advantage of people who did. You'd be surprised at the kind of bad behavior some people try to get away with on flights.", "Nta! Sorry kif he really wanted his ki to have a window he should have arranged it", "NTA- flight manifests are created based on the seat listed on your ticket. You should have just gotten the flight attendant.", "NaTA it is the girls' dad's fault that she was crying", "NTA. I hate when people act like having kids entitled them to other people' s seat..", "NTA. I personally prefer the aisle seat after having once been jammed into a window seat with a huge person stuffed into the middle seat. But I can definitely understand why you would want to keep your window seat. \n\nWith the current airline model of up-charging for \"better\" seats no one is obligated to give up their seat if they paid extra to specifically pick it. \n\nI paid an extra charge to get extra legroom on a long flight (i.e., economy plus). I was in an aisle seat and someone wanted to sit across the aisle from their travel companion and asked me to switch seats with them. But they were back in the \"packed like sardines\" section of coach (also in an aisle seat), so I declined telling them I had paid extra to upgrade for the extra legroom. I could tell that they weren't happy about it (since I am short)  but tough luck. They should have booked earlier and ungraded their own seat.\n\nIt is a little tougher when they are being passive-aggressive in the same row.", "NTA After those snide comments, I would have told him he was too cheap to pay for a window seat. In a loud voice. And then suggested for $100 there is the potential for swapping. The heck with those entitled people.", "NTA. That guy could have picked that very same seat for his kid. Yet he didn\u2019t. You have the right to sit in the seat that you want and paid for.", "NTA I've been asked to swap seats a few times. I select window seat over the wing specifically because of motion sickness issues. If push came to shove and I can't have both, I pick the window seat. \n\nI had a woman with a baby next to me ask me to trade with her mom (who had an aisle seat) so that they could sit together. I had to say no to her and she was pretty frosty to me. I just can't risk making myself sick. But I have traded with others when I got a window seat out of the deal.", "Tell them if the plane crashes they identify the body by the seat number you're sitting in", "NTA   Good for you to stand up for yourself.", "We had something similar recently - a mixup with the booking (won't use that travel agent again) meant that baby and I were in one part of the cabin and my husband and young son were in a different part. The two people who were supposed to be next to me kindly agreed to swap. They lost the bulkhead extra leg room seats (I was there as baby needed the bassinet), but got the further forward section you need to pay a bit extra for and weren't sat next to a baby for more than 12 hours, so I suppose it was reasonable.", "You must not read r/talesfromyourserver.", "There are plenty of airlines that ask families with young children to board first, and it's a good thing that they do - getting everything settled with young children on an aeroplane is much easier if you've got plenty of time to do it and there are less people around (and also less bags in the overhead lockers, so the bag with the vital toys/bottles/whatever is close by). It works fine with assigned seats.\n\nIt's also possible to rearrange seats if necessary. I recently had a 12 1/2 hour flight that (thanks to mixups with the booking) had seated me and our baby daughter in a different section of the cabin to my husband and our young son. Once we'd got on the plane and to our seats we realised there wasn't another baby in the seats beside me, so asked the flight attendants if the rest of the family could swap to there. When the two people with those seats arrived the attendants asked if they'd be happy to swap and they very kindly said they would. Two flight attendants helped everyone move so it all happened very smoothly.", "Yah! Always willing to swap for an upgrade in seating.", "Oh families first is absolutely great when you either have free for all seating, or pre-booked seating. The problem is when you let families on with un-allocated seating, then the pro who booked seats, without letting the families know which seats are booked. \n\nWhat ends up happening is the families grab the \u201cgood\u201d seats, which are booked, then the people with reserved seats get on, then the families move again. All ends up taking way too long to sort out", "That does sound a mess. I've never flown on an airline that didn't allocate seats, and didn't read your comment carefully enough, sorry.", "NTA, but the dad is the asshole for letting the kid take a seat that isn\u2019t hers, and those seats do cost more. It isn\u2019t your fault she\u2019s a child, as he pointed out, and I hardly see that as an excuse for letting her have your more expensive seat.

If he wants her in a window seat, he can pay for it.", "NTA", "ABSOLUTELY NTA. if the parent wanted that seat, he should have paid for it.", "NTA.

Nope.
