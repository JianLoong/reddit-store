People choose their seats of preference for all sorts of different reasons, and they shouldn\u2019t have to deal with someone just assuming that they can sit there.", "NTA. No, what is this epidemic of people assuming they can take another person's assigned seat? The seats can have different prices, and can be selected ahead of time. The father can keep his snide remarks to himself.", "NTA\n\nThere is a lot of similar cases (children want window seat, family want to seat together) but I **never** read a story when someone asked \"Hey, we couldn't get seats we'd liked.

It's paid for. Never feel bad about this.\n\nYou seem kind. No harm in sharing the view. But do you think for a second that kid's parent would let you sit there if the roles were reversed? Absolutely not.", "Nta. You father paid for that seat so sit in it.", "You are absolutely NOT the asshole. It\u2019s your seat that was paid for. The father is the asshole for not having the common courtesy or decency to even ASK first of his daughter could sit there to look out of the window. Kids (and adults) don\u2019t get everything they want, but some shorty parents these days act as if they should just because. If the father would have waited and asked if his daughter could look out of the window for even a few minutes of the flight, a kind person (such as yourself) may have obliged and it could have been nice for everyone, but entitled asshole was the asshole to you.\nChin up, love. You are fine and everything is going to be fine. Wishing you the best.", "NTA. It's not a free seat. I travel regular and have seen enough arguments about it and majority of the time you get the seat number indicated on your ticket.", "Nta\n\nKids don't get special treatment on planes just because they want to see out the windows. They need to learn not everything will go their way sometimes. Your dad paid for that seat so sit where you are meant to on the plane and the dad of the kid can stop bullying you now", "NTA. It's your seat. If girls dad wanted a window he should have chosen one when he bought the ticket.", "NTA. its your seat. If they wanted a window seat for their kid, they should have reserved one. Dont let people bully you. Thats what he was trying to do.", "NTA. I hate when people do this. It\u2019s a child. Give them your seat that you paid for. They\u2019re old. Give them your seat that you paid for. They\u2019re crying. Give them your seat that you paid for. They\u2019re married and want to sit together. Give them your seat that you paid for. Well if you wanted it so badly you could have paid for it before. Why the hell should we pay extra and then have to give it up to someone else cuz of some sob story??", "NTA \n\nIf he wanted his daughter to have the window seat then he should have booked one", "NTA if you select your seat you have every right to sit in it", "NTA. You booked that seat, and you should get that seat. The dad expecting you to just accommodate his kid is ridiculous.", "NTA, you have to stand up for yourself", "NTA. You paid for the seat, you sit in the seat.", "Sounds like your dad was more insisted than you", "NTA don't even let them say nothing to you about it, either.  There's really nothing to discuss; it's your seat", "NTA. He didn't even have the courtesy to ask you. Arrogance should not be rewarded.", "NTA. People paid for certain seats. No one else is entitled to them. I am super claustrophobic but live literally across the country from my fam so 6+ hr flights are unavoidable. I manage the anxiety specifically by planning 2-4 hr flights with 3-4 hr layovers in between and pay extra to make sure I am in an aisle seat near front of plane for extra empty space beside me, otherwise I would be in a full blown panic attack. I cannot COUNT how many times people have called me names for refusing to cede my seat to a family or someone who feels like they deserve or need it more than me. Stand. Your. Ground.\n\nThough if you genuinely didn\u2019t care window vs aisle it might have been kind to let her keep the seat, it was certainly not an AH move not to if your dad paid extra.", "NTA the entitlement of some people!", "NTA.  Further, you should have contacted the flight attendant right away.", "NTA. You paid for that seat, it's your seat. That man was rude and had no right to try and guilt trip you into giving it to his kid.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA.\n\nThe father is well and truly the AH for thinking he's entitled enough to take what he pleases (the fact that it's for his daughter is irrelevant).\n\nIt's so simple and it comes up so often I can't believe it's still even discussed. You sit in the seat that is booked for _you_. If you ask to swap and they say no, end of discussion. Shut up and let everyone enjoy their flight.", "NTA. If he wanted the window seat for his kid he could have gotten it, either by booking earlier or paying a bit more. Instead he tried to guilt you about it. That's unfair, it probably made your flight significantly worse too, turning it around in your mind the whole time. That's why it's a dick move on his part.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
