I get a window seat to sleep. You can't do that as well in an aisle seat. I've had to ask the flight attendant to intervene to get someone to move who refused to. Once you get to an elevation or time of day there's nothing to see.", "NTA-you paid for the seat\n\nthose are how it works", "You wanted a window seat and paid for one. If he wanted the same he should have booked it. \n\nReddit is full of assholes who think they can demand what someone else paid for. NTA.", "NTA. It is never wrong to take the seat you were assigned AND paid for. The father needs to teach his child how to not be entitled.\n\nETA: ONCE my husband and I asked to switch seats on a plane. There was a boy behind behind me aggressively kicking my seat. To the point of it actually pushing me forward. We politely asked the parents to stop their child multiple times as it was hard enough to actually hurt. This happened non-stop for the first hour of the flight and even the attendants asked the parents to stop their son without us even saying anything. The row in front of us was completely empty so we asked if we could move up a row. So once we didn\u2019t use our assigned seats on a flight, however we did attempt to diffuse the situation calmly, and didn\u2019t cause any other people to relocate.", "NTA. Father is gonna raise a narcissist.", "NTA, this has happened to me. But do not argue with the person occupying your seat. Stow your bags near the seat and move to the back of the plane so other passengers could board. Then when you see a stewardess let them handle the situation.", "NTA. Airfare is expensive. Do not let someone guilt or bully you.", "NTA, I hate entitled people thinking that because they have a kid, they get special choosing powers in situations like this. Buy a window ticket or deal with the fact that you won\u2019t have a window seat. Be happy you get to even sit by your kid cuz plane tickets suck sometimes with how seating is chosen and flights get overbooked constantly.", "NTA. You sound like you don't have much traveling experience yet. There will be so much manipulativeness and emotional  blackmail trying to game you out of a better seat that you've paid premium for. Get used to it, and learn to politely hold your ground. You did great.", "NTA.", "NTA - The guy could have paid for his daughter to have a window seat just like YOUR FATHER DID FOR YOU. Why are you letting this man bully you? Please stop that, remember, your dad paid for this for you.", "Window seats cost extra money. \n\nNTA", "NTA,the child's father is teaching his child entitled behaviour. Your dad paid for that seat for you and I'm glad he made you stick for yourself.", "NTA\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a situation where a child waa given a seat away from a parent - this is a situation where a parent was feeling entitled to something they didn\u2019t pay for because they have a child.\n\nSince you wanted your window seat, it was reasonable to expect to sit in your seat.", "NTA - you bought that seat- you should sit in it.  If the guy wanted a window seat for his child he should have bought tickets earlier.", "Nta, you paid for it. What if you bought a car and someone who bought a cheaper model insisted on switching?", "NTA. If this happens again, the flight attendants are trained to handle such issues.", "Nta. I hate how entitled parents are", "NTA. Seats are assigned for a reason. You were looking forward to a window seat, you paid for window seat -- PERIOD! That father knew he was doing wrong by indulging his child. Still, I pity you having to sit next to a screaming brat.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's your seat, bought and paid for by your father.\n\nThe child's father had the same opportunity to pay for a window seat, he didn't, not your problem.", "nta", "Nta. It's your assigned seat you paid for and wanted. If kid wanted window seat, dad should have gotten one.", "NTA\nWhy people think they are entitled to things that aren\u2019t there\u2019s I\u2019ll never know", "NTA\n\nIf he wanted his kid to have the window seat, he should have bought it. Having a kid does not mean everyone else in the world pays for or sacrifices to ensure your child's happiness.", " \nNTA.  He should have paid for the seat for his child.  The fact that he expects you to give it up because she\u2019s is a kid is wrong.  I hope you held your seat and gave him a snide remark back.", "NTA. Dad is. You want a window seat for your brat, then pay for it.", "NTA. I always pick a window seat. He should have done the same for his kid.", "NTA. Not at all. He should have gotten her a window seat if he thought it was so important. Also on long flights I really like to have the window seat so I can lean against the wall and sleep. The aisle seat is not equivalent", "A dad chose a middle seat instead of putting child there and taking aisle? Things that didn't happen for $1000", "NTA.  The man took  tried to take advantage of you and he was banking on the likelihood that you'd feel guilty because it was a little girl in the seat.  Your father is 100% right.  He paid extra for the window seat for you.  If the man wanted a window seat for his daughter he should have paid for it.", "NTA I personally prefer window but isle has its own charms and I\u2019d have probably made the swap myself. But you were perfectly ok to stand your ground.", "NTA, \nMy mother (first solo trip) gave her seat up to some random guy who refused to move. When they landed, pilot told them not to move, police came onto the plane, headed for her (new) seat, asked if she was the dude and she pointed them in the right direction. \n\nNEVER get bullied into switching seats, especially if it\u2019s on you\u2019ve paid for.", "NTA. People like that dad are the worst, and he\u2019s doing a terrible disservice to his daughter. She needs to learn that she will not always get her way, and he needs to learn that if he wants a specific seat, he needs to pay for it / select it \u2014 the world does not bend around him.", "NTA. It sounds like they didn't have the excuse of wanting to sit together, which is totally understandable for someone traveling with a small child. Airlines do split up parents and children and then the parents are left begging strangers to inconvenience themselves so their five-year-old doesn't have to be alone. But this is not that.", "NTA.\n\nSo tired of folks who think they're entitled to what others rightfully paid for. PS - your father's right.", " NTA. Any distress the kid had was the result of her dad being a dirtbag. He\u2019s also a passive aggressive asshole.", "NTA if they wanted the window seat they should\u2019ve bought it. I am so sick of people pulling this on airplanes", "I\u2019ve given up my window seat to a polite stranger before but I would for this guy, he was just an entitled as trying to use his cute kid instead of his words (or money cuz he could\u2019ve just booked it) NTA", "NTA, her dad he should have bought a window seat. You could have shared to be kind tho.", "NTA!!!!  Shame on that dad for using his child to bully you into moving.  DADDY  needs to grow up!!", "NTA. You paid for the seat, you sit in the seat. Case closed. Anyone who objects isn't worth another thought.", "NTA! Absolutely NTA.\n\nThe girl's dad is a massive piece of sh*t. He should have shelled out for the seat if it meant so much.\n\nThis is a very common trick amongst stingy parents, they don't pre-book seats so the airline assigns random less desirable seats to them and they intend to use their child to score the better seats, such a despicable tactic.", "NTA. While at least he didn't offer the middle (! SOME PEOPLE DO! THAT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS!), aisle and window seats aren't interchangeable either for many people. I pick the aisle so I can get up to pee more than the average human. I don't want someone's claustrophobic window seat unless they've got a really good story for why they need the aisle.", "I've only had it happen once, not with money but with leg room.\n\nFlight got downsized and the seats were scrambled. Family of four with small children got jumbled to where one parent was separated and I was next to the other three. The person on the other side wouldn't budge on trading. The dad traded me his seat right behind bulkhead and I had all the leg room. But he was polite and apologetic and it was much better than being stuck with an antsy 5 year old who wanted a parent.\n\nI know traveling nowadays sucks and everyone is tired and sore from being stuck in airports and flying sardine cans, but it's amazing how much a bit of politeness or kindness goes.", "I think you would enjoy r/stolenseats", "Whatttt? How did that kid get through security etc without a boarding pass??", "Yeah, my husband and I refuse to pay for reserved seats, if we can't reserve seats for free, we take whatever they give us.  Most of the time they put us together, but it's NBD if they don't.", "It would have been kind if the Dad would have sat his kid in the seat he paid for.  He didn't even offer OP to pay the difference between the two seats.  If you want a window seat pay for one.", "I love southwest. They have the best prices, allowed two carry-ons and two checked bags included in the price, and I've never had a problem with their customer service, or flight attendants. You also have the option of being able to pay extra to be in the first groups of seating, and then you do get to choose your seats. It's only the people in the last groups that end up having to sit in what's left.", "You're welcome to your opinion, but you haven't changed mine.\n\nSometimes it's just alright to be nice to little kids.\n\nHave a nice day my friend.", "Worse than that, he tried to intimidate this young woman into accepting the aisle seat.", "And if he really wanted a window seat for his kid, then he should have booked one!! I hate how people fail to consider parental responsibility", "Yup. I love the window seat. But if someone asks nicely for their child to enjoy take-off I'll oblige. Mostly because that was one of the magical things about flying for me as a kid.", "Between a window seat and an isle seat the window seat is clearly the worse seat, especially on a long international flight. Much better to be able to stretch your legs and get up easier without asking two other people.", "That too. But just in general, I think it's weird to put the blame on an airline for this (even though airlines suck), instead of just blaming the people being inconsiderate.", "When we flew Southwest at Christmas we checked in right on time and still ended up in the C group. Fortunately, someone saw the 3 of us struggling to find seats together and offered to move so that at least one parent could sit with our daughter. She's a teenager and used to flying, so we didn't feel like we had right to ask. Add in the mess with all the flights home, and I don't think we'll ever use Southwest again.", "I did exactly this for my last pre-Covid international trip. It was a beautiful sunset and I was really looking forward to seeing it, but as they were coming down the aisle I saw a mom and her son talking excitedly about hoping no one was in the window seat so they could see the sunset, and of course they landed on my aisle. I could see the kid was disappointed and the mom looked like this was the rotten cherry at the end of a really bad day, so I just hopped up and offered to switch for takeoff. \n\nI made the kid tell me everything he saw as we left, though. Got my own personal little David Attenborough yelling across his mom\u2019s lap to tell me all the things he saw in the city below. It was honestly great.", "That\u2019s what I do, I don\u2019t actually want to SEE that I\u2019m off the ground.", "It depends. I prefer aisle too but I know someone who falls asleep five minutes in the air. For him window seat is a dream (in many ways ;-) . Some people feel better if they can look outside or are annoyed when flight attendants and passengers walk by them all the time.", "I prefer the window seat on long flights because I can lean against the wall and sleep. I absolutely cannot sleep in a middle or aisle.", "Yeah, getting the family seating together is the big issue.  I used to never mind that style of seating, but then they\u2019ve been adding ever more groups of pre-paid options, so you\u2019re further and further back in the priority list, so there\u2019s no way you\u2019d be able to sit with you pr family.\n\nI don\u2019t know what else to do though, it seems like other airlines have the family surcharge.  Over Thanksgiving, I had to pay close to $500 extra just so the three of us could sit together.  Granted, the biggest travel day of the year and I missed the opening day for seat selection but still.  There ought to be a better option for families"]}
