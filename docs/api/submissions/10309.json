You and your wife asked them to leave the dogs home for a change. They agreed but then brought the dogs anyway.\n\n\"thought you guys were cool with it\" appears to be a blatant lie. More like, \"thought you guys would let us get away with it.\"\n\nLeaving was entirely appropriate. Telling them to let you know when they're willing to meet up without their dogs was appropriate, too.", "Nta I\u2019d leave too.", "It does sound like a frustrating situation.  I wouldn't bring my dogs to anything like that.  I guess it's time to make new friends.", "NTA, I am a dog person, but this is so on different level. It's nice to have dog outings when everyone is on bord, but sometimes it should be about people as well. So yeah, start nit dog firendly gatherings with those friends that are on board", "NTA, your wife told them it was making both you and her enjoy this less, and they said they\u2019d leave them out of it\u2026 and then didn\u2019t, they lied because they didn\u2019t care about your feelings and thought you where both being overdramatic.", "NTA. But I have a feeling you and this friend group no longer match.", "NTA, but you are going to lose these friends. As when your peer group starts to have kids, as people\u2019s lives change and move forward, the people around them will either adapt to preserve the friendship or decide it isn\u2019t worth it. In this scenario it sounds like you are the odd couple out in enjoying brunch outings without dogs, so be prepared to have the dog couples choose each other over you.", "Friends: we won't bring the dogs. *secretly bring the dogs* \n\nOP: *sees the dogs* We are leaving. \n\nFriends: *surprised Pikachu face* But why? \n\nSeriously, what did they think was going to happen? \n\nOP, NTA. It may be time to look for new friends, because the brunch dogs have clearly shown they don't care about you.", "NTA. Some of our friends smoke so our outings often are centered around accommodating their smoking. It can be frustrating when you can\u2019t just enjoy an outing. It\u2019s especially frustrating that your friends agreed to have a dog-free day but didn\u2019t follow through with that promise. I think it was appropriate for you to leave because of that and that you knew you wouldn\u2019t enjoy it.", "NTA. it's fine to not want to do things without the dogs once in a while. And, they agreed to leave the dogs at home this time, then broke that promise. It's not OK to agree to agree to something, only to ambush you with something else.\n\nThere is a middle ground here - have some events that are dog friendly and then have some where the dogs don't come. It's not an unreasonable compromise.", "NTA find new friends. They\u2019re dog people, you aren\u2019t.", "NTA. I love my pandemic pup and dogs in general but there\u2019s a time and a place for him to be involved. Your friends are making a choice to involve their dogs to a degree where there is no compromise. That would bother me too.", "NTA, but you will lose these friends. They are NTA either.  Their interests have changed and yours haven't.  This often happens over the years.  You can decide at this point if the friendship is worth being with the dogs or not.", "NTA. You expressed the desire to have dog-free events multiple times. Leaving is appropriate, as is telling them why.", "NTA in my opinion. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re the assholes either though. Everyone has different likes and dislikes. If you\u2019re not a dog person and these people are huge dog people that have no interest in ever leaving their pups at home, it might be time to find a new group of friends that doesn\u2019t revolve their group hangouts around the pups 100% of the time.", "Why don't you start organizing your own dog un-friendly brunch with like-minded friends? \n\nNAH, you are at an age where old friendships fade as people's interests change. You think dogs ruin the vibe? Wait until the babies arrive.", "NAH - find new brunch friends", "NTA - for leaving. YTA for thinking they should leave the dogs at home - if you don\u2019t like it don\u2019t hang out with them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I assume you know that the world does not revolve around you and your day drinking. It's OK not to want to go out with dogs but you cannot expect people who like dogs and this new outing style to suddenly stop to accommodate you.", "NTA. Propose an every other time with dogs. The dogs could also be a signal that these people don\u2019t  want to drink all day anymore. Can\u2019t get drunk with your dog.", "NTA. Tricking you guys was shitty. But it looks like you\u2019ve naturally outgrown this friend group. They clearly want their group to be centered around dogs. You don\u2019t. They\u2019re TA for tricking you, but not for wanting dog-friendly activities. Just move on.", "They're allowed to like bringing the dogs, you're allowed to not. You're NTA and they are because it seems like they lied about bringing them. Unless your wife lied about asking.", "they're lying (at least in this last instance) about bringing the dogs, and ignoring OP's stated desire for a dog-free event. That's TA, not NTA.", "The friends are NTA just for bringing the dogs normally, however they are TA in this situation because they specifically lied and said they would leave the dogs and then brought them anyway.", "And that's exactly what happened after the friends lied about bringing the dogs.", "Asking doesn't make OP an asshole. Pushing after they said \"no\" to leaving them at home would have made OP an asshole. The fact that they agreed and then brought them anyway makes them assholes. Pretty simple.", "Yes, they shouldn't have lied. But just because OP would like a dog free event doesn't mean they have to comply with that.  He can choose not to attend, which is what he did.  Friends grow apart.", "NTA. I\u2019m a dog\nLover. I have always had dogs. I have a friend who is now a \u201cdog mom\u201d and her obsession with her dog and bringing her everywhere is so ridiculous and annoying. She recently didn\u2019t come to an important dinner she had RSVPd to because I asked her not to bring her dog (for good reason, as the dog that lives at the house can/will\nBe aggressive with other dogs). So frustrating.", "NTA\n\nGoing for a walk and then coffee with my friends and our dogs is a lot of fun but that\u2019s not the only social thing we do. Lying \u201coh we won\u2019t bring the dogs \u201c is really dodgy.", "Are you sure there wasn't a miscommunication about whether or not the dogs would be there? It seems weird that your friends would bring dogs even though they specifically agreed not to bring them. Was this place a favorite location by the group before dogs, or only after dogs? I only ask because since the dogs were there, it was obviously dog friendly and it seems like an odd place to meet up for your friends who said they wouldn't bring their dogs. NTA if your friends truly lied about bringing their dogs, but I just feel like there was a break in the line of communication somewhere. It could be this outing and location and activities were already planned to include dogs and they thought your wife meant an outing in the future? Idk, it just seems like too much of a jerk move out of no where, so unless you have a history with your friends being mean like this, I'd say try and figure out what happened to cause the mixup.", "If the friends don't want a dog-free event, they're totally free to respond so when OP states the desire for one. Instead, they lie and place him in the awkward position of presenting at an event they already KNOW he would choose not to attend if he had sufficient information. The 'friends' are so far down the asshole pipe they're sewage. \n\nOf course, now OP knows that the friends DGAF about the relationship, he can reassess and find better friends.", "NTA. Leaving the dogs home is not a big deal.", "NTA\nMaybe your friend group could alternate: dog-friendly outing, kid-friendly outing, adult human only outing.", "NTA for not wanting to always be around dogs. \n\nBut I consider it a lot more enjoyable than drinking and bar-hopping.", "As a dog person with two dogs that are my whole world, after my partner, NTA. Just cause they\u2019re my world doesn\u2019t make them yours. Just cause I love them doesn\u2019t mean you do. I would also not take them so many places with friends it became a problem, and will put them up if my friends want them up when they\u2019re coming over. \n\nYou might have lost this friend group, and I\u2019m sorry that they\u2019re too self absorbed to care about you.", "NTA. I'm a total dog person, but that doesn't mean he goes everywhere with me and he certainly doesn't accompany me if other friends aren't dog people. \nTime to find a new friend group; this group is heading in a different direction to you and your wife", "NTA. I love dogs and would totally be down for this. I hate kids and would definitely not be ok with hangouts constantly being child friendly. It\u2019s the same thing. You\u2019ve voiced your opinion and if no one is willing to add in some adult-only hangouts, it sounds like seeking out new friends might be in order (which sucks, I know).", "NTA!", "Nta dog parents are over doing it. They can have their catch ups but you don\u2019t have to be there fending off their slobber and fur pretending that it\u2019s cute that you have paw marks on your clothes now.", "NAH-\n\nYou have a compatibility issue. Not your fault or theirs. Find a new group or accept the new dynamic. People may have kids and that changes the dynamic as well. You can choose to deal or move on.", "Join us at r/dogfree. Unlike some dogs; we don\u2019t bite.", "Nta cut them off.", "Probably the one friend she spoke to agreed but couldn't talk the others into ditching the dogs or didn't even try.  He just figured he'd see what happened.  He found out."]}
