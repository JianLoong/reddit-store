You have to do what's right for you, you can always make another appointment with this old therapist again in the future", "First of all you need a psychologist that you feel comfortable with, that being said being a psychologist is a profession and it's very hard and important to keep a healthy divide between life and work, don't take the schedule change as a personal attack. If you can't move past that then you should stop going, or maybe you could go and talk about it and how it made you feel, it would be helpful and productive to talk about it with her and see if there's a deeper reason why you feel so affected by something so seemingly trivial.\n\nNTA", "INFO: When she told you that her next available appointment wasn\u2019t until 11/29, did you ask her if there was any way she could work you in earlier? Or did you just say \u201cok\u201d and leave feeling bad about it?", "NTA- there\u2019s other psychologists on the planet and she didn\u2019t seem to make any effort to reschedule things with you or reach out to you at all.", "NTA. She broke your trust, though it sounds like she didn't mean to. Was she apologetic? Up until that point, did you feel you were making progress? If so, reschedule and talk this out with her. If not, maybe the timing is right to try another provider. Good luck, OP!", "NAH\n\nLike you said, mistakes happen, and it hurts. And you are allowed to hurt. However, it sounds like you rather have her making time for you instead of not seeing her again? If that is so, I would consider telling your psychologists that in very clear words. If however the trust is broken too much, it might be difficult to continue with her. Which is also ok.", "NTA, at all. It's possible this was even a discreet attempt to soft-fire you as a client, which is an extremely shitty thing to do given the long wait times for therapists right now. even if it wasn't, you're right to feel that it's disrespectful.", "NTA.   You can stop being her client for any or no reason.  She is not entitled to your business in perpetuity.   In this case, she gave you bad service so you have a very good reason to find another therapist.  That being said, if you made an appointment with her, you should cancel it.", "NAH.\n\nFraming behavior around your psychologist as asshole/not asshole is not a healthy way to engage with therapy. Expecting your psychologist to hold you in personal regard with a full schedule is not that reasonable. Trying to get out of therapy or seek justification to avoid it is a very common and bad outcome of certain mental illnesses. I say this to point out that you're missing a key issue by asking things in this way.\n\nIt is possible that they communicated poorly and it's entirely their fault, but if that is sufficient to not want to go to them anymore you should be seeking new services, not focusing on quitting this one. If you do want to leave therapy, yes, you should contact them to cancel so that you don't deal with future hassle or bills for missed appointments.", "NTA you should attend therapy with someone who feels comfortable. There might be reasons it isn't feasible, though since it's her mistake, I would expect her to work late or through lunch to accommodate you the day you were there. \n\nBut, don't ghost.  Not showing up for an appointment or cancelling to close to an appointment is typically charged anyway.", "NTA you are paying for a service, she has been dismissive of your agreement. You have no obligation to have any other communication with her. It might feel good to stand up for yourself and not contact her again.", "NTA. Listen, I have been going to therapy for 15 years and I've had several different therapists. Therapy is a safe space. If you feel like your therapist is not working for you, then absolutely find another. She's not going to care long term because they know that you need to find the therapist that works for you. However, if this is the first time you found yourself unhappy with her and you just feel abandoned, keep in mind that therapists are human. They also have holidays and drama and things that take up space in their head. Perhaps she didn't notice this week, but she probably would have in a couple of weeks. It's normal to have sessions bimonthly or even monthly and it could have just escaped her notice. What I'm saying is that you need to do what's best for you, but keep in mind that everyone makes mistakes and it isn't personal, even if it feels that way. It isn't personal.", "NTA. I don't agree with others that you need to announce your departure unless it means you plan to no show to your appointment. Don't no show, just cancel, but beyond that you don't owe her anything. You're a paying customer and she needs to get her business in check.", "NAH \n\nIt was an honest mistake and her not noticing that your appointments does not mean you weren't memorable. She most likely deals with hundreds of patients each week. You can tell that she is busy due to the 2 patients there at the same time.", "This is incredibly ironic (and very sadly so) but it's very unhealthy to place so much of your sense of self worth in whether your psychologist remembers you or not.\n\nWhile she might be your one and only psychologist, she has dozens patients other than you to treat as well. \n\nDo you have a GP who referred you to this psychologist? Because this would be a great equation to ask a mental health professional... except you obviously can't ask the psychologist now, so your referring GP is probably you best second option.\n\nNAH - this isn't a Reddit question, this is serious mental health.\n\n#**EDIT TO ALL THE NTA COMMENTERS: YOU KNOW HOW IT'S HARD TO FIND A THERAPIST OR COUNSELLOR THESE DAYS?

FUCKING HELL.**", "Just text her and say you no longer wish to see her anymore and leave it at that, i feel if you just ghost her with no warning then you will be the asshole but your feelings are valid and you don't have to explain why you no longer wish to see her", "NTA. Therapy is a safe place where you\u2019re supposed to feel very taken care of, emotionally. When your therapist \u201cditches\u201d you and makes you feel like you don\u2019t matter, all the work you\u2019re doing goes down the drain. If you liked going there and made good progress, I suggest you keep your next session to talk about what happened. Most likely the patient that replaced you that day had an emergency. If you don\u2019t feel your therapy was worth jt, ghost away.", "NTA to ghost. But probably doing yourself a major disservice.\n\nTherapists are people and people inevitably do things that offend or hurt each other in relationships. If we bail any time anyone offends/hurts us then we undermine our ability to form lasting meaningful relationships. \n\nInstead use this as an opportunity for assertive communication and repair with a person who is literally trained to help you with that. Think about what you want her to know (e.g.,\u201cI understand that everyone makes mistakes but I want you to know that I felt unimportant and brushed off when you weren\u2019t able to see me the last time I came to your office. I even considered not coming back but I think we\u2019ve already done some good work together and want to see if we can use this as an opportunity to change some of my typical patterns in relationships.\u201d)\n\nThen you can think about if there is a specific ask, \u201ci was kind of dazed when you weren\u2019t able to see me in the moment and wasn\u2019t sure if there were other options to talk before today, is there a way I can contact you between sessions if I need to communicate with you in the future? Do you have any ideas about how we can repair and continue to do good work together?\u201d\n\nAnd if she is super defensive or dismissive then you have the info you need that you aren\u2019t going to be a good fit. And if she is super validating and appreciative of you communicating this then you will likely feel even better about working together moving forward, and will be better and communicating what you need from her to get the most out of your treatment.\n\nWish you the best!", "NTA.  As a professional therapist, if I had screwed up that badly on scheduling (it happens), I would have prioritized getting you in as soon as possible.  I would have also been *extremely* apologetic about my error.  If I were you, however, I would let your psychologist know that you won't be coming back. This way, you won't be charged for the no show.  \n\nAnother possibility would be to show up for the appointment and explain to her that you were hurt by the fact that she cancelled on you twice and the way that she did it.  Some good therapeutic work might come out of such a conversation.  Totally up to you and what you feel ok with.", "NTA. You need to feel comfortable with your psychologist.

Sounds like a mistake she made, and the communication around it wasn't handled great. Not everyone is super aware of schedules like that though. The therapist probably sees so many people a week, and maybe not everyone has a regularly timed appointment. They maybe just look at their calendar instead of knowing who comes in at what time by hard, even if some of them are regular appointments.\n\nIf you want to quit therapy with your current therapist though, don't 'ghost' her.

Obviously, this isn\u2019t always possible (and if the client is dangerous or threatening it\u2019s not appropriate), but that\u2019s the standard we should aspire to (especially the part about giving referrals).
