Your sister created this situation with her own behavior. It's not your responsibility to dig her out of it.", "NTA. You're just a kid yourself. This shouldn't be put on you. I hate the whole 'but it's family' argument. I'm glad your Dad is in your corner. Make sure you stand firm.", "\" I\u2019m not going to fail my classes from her mistake.\"\n\nGood for you.  NTA\n\n\"I should just get over it and help out family.\"\n\nShe should stop drinking and driving.  She created this problem.", "NTA. 3days is a very reasonable compromise. You're not leaving her in a bind. It doesn't matter what anyone has done for you, you are not obligated to help anyone. And good for you for keeping boundaries and doing what's best for you. Some of us are not good at doing that.", "NTA \n\nYour niece is not your responsibility. Your sister messed up, and thankfully no one was hurt. However, that still doesn\u2019t change the fact that you are not responsible for your niece. At the moment, she would be your mom\u2019s responsibility. And as such, it is her responsibility to find someone to care for your niece when she can\u2019t. Your focus should be your schoolwork. Refusing to watch her without pay doesn\u2019t make you \u201ca moody teenager\u201d. I think if I were you I would spend more time at your dad\u2019s since he seems to understand the issues going on at your mom\u2019s.", "NTA - I do think it is unfair that they assume you will do it indefinitely.  I think the 3 days is a nice gesture on your part and shows you are there to help.", "NTA withdraw your offer of three days based on the abuse you are getting. Stay with your dad. Focus on your education and own life", "NTA at all. So glad your dad has your back. It says alot about your mother, prioritizing free babysitting over your education. Jesus.", "NTA, where is the criticism for the sister who risked her child's life? I'm not being facetious here, I know someone who lost a child because their ex's mum drove drunk.  Their toddler was also in the car so there's some bonus trauma for her.\nGlad your dad stuck up for you OP.", "NTA.  Go back and stay with your dad full time.. if your mom takes it to court then tell them why you don\u2019t wanna be there. \nYou\u2019re 16. You have a choice if you want to go over or not. The court should take that into consideration..\nIf it\u2019s a custody thing.", "NTA, you have your own stuff to worry about.  I hope your sister can get her act together, this is really sad", "NTA you're setting up boundaries and why should you provide free babysitting because your sister chose to drive drunk", "NTA at all\n\nThey need to figure out another solution", "NTA. It\u2019s one thing if you\u2019re a paid babysitter, but sounds like it\u2019s interfering with your school work.  Hold your ground and prioritize your education, because your niece isn\u2019t your responsibility. Your mom needs to hire a babysitter. You\u2019re old enough to say you don\u2019t want to visit her, by the way, if these visits are just stressing you out. And your dad sounds like he would listen.", "Very much NTA and this family dynamic seems\u2026 interesting to say the least. You\u2019re sister fucks up and now you have to babysit her child that was removed from her, for free, just because she is family? Nope! \n\nThe child is not your responsibility - your mother should not have taken her is she did not have a plan for her care. It would be different if there were a share of the burden with other family/friends but to automatically expect you to watch a toddler everyday for nothing is unacceptable. She can put her in a daycare, have a baby sitter, ask other family as well.\n\nYour life and future should not be put on hold or compromised because they cant come up with a sustainable care plan.", "NTA\n\nThe least your family can do is take your situation into account.  You're trying to offer what support you can, but you have a life too and this ultimately is not your responsibility.", "NTA. Focus on your education. Your sister's lack of planning- irresponsibility actually- does not make it your problem. You have offered some help, the rest they have to figure out.", "NTA, this is their child not yours.\n\nHelping is fine, being used a free sitter isn't.\n\nStand your ground and don't let them bully you into accepting, you don't owe them anything OP.", "Wait, your sister got pregnant at 13-14yo? Yeah, her daycare because she continues to make VERY BAD choices is not your problem. Ffs she\u2019s not even old enough to drink legally. Your mother should be responsible for this, not you. Gtfo asap. Drunk driving with a child in the car is the effing worst omg I can\u2019t even be civil. Now I\u2019m in Reddit timeout. NTA", "NTA and don\u2019t back down. Your mom chose to assume responsibility for your niece and she needs to figure it out. It is not your problem and you have your own life to worry about. That is your priority.", "NTA, your dad is a good parent, while your mom... Well. Let's stick to you being NTA and that's all)))", "NTA\n\nNo one forced your sister to get behind the wheel while intoxicated, no one forced your sister to put her toddler into the car she was driving while intoxicated. \n\nYour sister made a huge mistake, yes. She put her child in danger while doing it too.\n\nYou are not obligated to watch her kid. You didn't help create the kid, your sister made her bed and none of it is your responsibility.", "NTA, dad has your back.  I would go live with dad and let your Mom and sister figure this out.  Your not obligated to provide free childcare.  Your mother is treating you like a built in babysitter and not holding your sister accountable for her very actions that got her child removed from her custody.  Good luck!", "NTA. Not your baby, not your problem. If I were you I just stay at your dad\u2019s house and not go to mom\u2019s if they\u2019re just going to do that to you.", "Look, sometimes family has to sacrifice to make best with what they have, so your mother and sister can sacrifice some cash to you or a babysitter. NTA", "NTA.  You do not have clean up your sisters actions.  It is one thing to watch the kids for a few hours while your mom goes to the store.  Asking you to compromise your education is not fair.", "NTA - that baby is not your responsibility in any way. Your help should be appreciated not shit on", "Nta. Stay strong. Do not let your sister's isdued affect your future. Your mother got custody - it is on her to figure out childcare.", "NTA whatsoever. You shouldn't have your education interrupted (which can directly impact your future) because your sister goofed up big time.\n\nBesides that, I really don't get why your mom is defending your sister. Driving drunk kills SO many people, and your niece was in the car when she was driving! I understand alcoholism is hell, but that's totally unacceptable. There might be some child endangerment charges coming your sister's way, so the 'temporary custody' might end up longer than you think. Putting your foot down now will prevent you from becoming the dedicated babysitter.", "NTA: I'm so glad you have your father in your corner. Babysitting or pet sitting is a systemic problem with your mother. You are not free labor. Since you're not there all the time it would be nice if she actually wanted to spend time with you instead of dictating how you spend your time.", "NTA. You're 16. Can your mom take time off? Can your dad help? Any other family on your side nearby or your niece's dad's family? You shouldn't have to fail classes. To expect a 16 year old to take care of a 2 year old, even if it were summer break and you didn't have school, is too big of an ask. There has to be another solution that doesn't involve a minor such as yourself swooping in to save the day.", "NTA", "Nta. You are still a child, you are not responsible for being a stand in mommy. Your sister and mother are adults, childcare responsibilities fall on them.", "NTA I'm not surprised in the slightest to hear yhat you live with your dad. Your mom and sister sounds like entitled AHs. If they expect for you to babysit they'd better start paying you like a babysitter. Alternatively tell them a hard no and don't babysit at all. You have zero obligation here expect to your school studies and yourself.", "NTA.  Three days are more than generous.  Why aren't your sisters chipping in?", "NTA, help for 3 days then get back to your dads. Your sisters and mom are NOT on paths you want to be on and are not supporting you to be your best self.", "NTA not your job at all, you're not the parent", "NTA. She isn't your child or your responsibility, and shoutout to dad for having your back. \n\nThat being said, 3 days might not be enough time to find a full-time sitter, and your niece is still an innocent party. Mom is desperate to keep the baby in a safe environment, and needs everyone to work together. While my gut says \"not your responsibility,\" I'd hate to think what could happen when a child doesn't get proper care.", "NTA\n\nAnd you are 100% correct that you need to take your online classes and should have a break.  Its an all around shitty situation created by your sister and everyone is in a panic mode trying to put out this fire.\n\nI would recommend changing the narrative though, something like \"Mom I'm happy to help as much as I reasonably can.  Reasonably, you agree that my classes are important, right? And reasonably, I need time during the day for them, right?  And I also need time for myself too, right?  I can take these times on these days, but how do we find a way to fill that gap?\"\n\nYou go from saying \"no\" about the times you can't to saying \"yes\" for the times you can.  The \"no\" on the times you can't is implied and you are leading her to think about someone else for those times.\n\nAs a side note: besides hiring a baby sitter another option is that many companies offer daycare services benefits and those daycare services often allow for emergencies even from people who don't use the benefit normally.  Your mom would need to contact the HR department about that.", "NTA\n\nNot your job to watch someone else's kid, but if they literally have no one else then I dont know why you wouldn't help even if you didn't want to or were busy. Not saying making concessions when people are being unreasonable is justified, but if they are really relying on you I'd just bite the bullet tbh. Not everything can go your way all the time. Don't make it the kid's problem too.", "NTA but in your mom\u2019s defense daycare/sitters right now are hard to come by or EXPENSIVE AF I pay 225 a WEEK for my 2yo (definitely not your problem tho lol)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The dreaded brain fart!", "If your mom works at a large enough company, she can take FMLA to have time to sort this out. Is it your sister's first DUI? Often for first offence she can be diverted to a court supervised recovery program. Requirements.vary by state. I know PA gives a 3 day license suspension, a 1 year ignition interlock, a drug and alcohol evaluation which then may or may not require AA meetings. A class about the dangers of driving under the influence with a visit by the coroner who brings pictures of the results of drunk driving accidents. It's expensive, it's a pia, but for non-alcoholics who made a mistake it's effective. And the offender gets to be home with their kid. Of course the complicating factor is having her kid in the car. CPS will definitely be involved if they let her have custody back. Not your circus, not your monkeys, NTA. Leave if your mom is interfering with your school. Courts have a dim view of what your mom is trying to do.", "Ohhh I was very concerned about a pregnant 14 year old who\u2019s getting DUIs already at 16!!", "My mistake"]}
