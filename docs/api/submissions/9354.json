Some of us are not good at doing that.", "NTA \n\nYour niece is not your responsibility. Your sister messed up, and thankfully no one was hurt. However, that still doesn\u2019t change the fact that you are not responsible for your niece. At the moment, she would be your mom\u2019s responsibility.

Their toddler was also in the car so there's some bonus trauma for her.\nGlad your dad stuck up for you OP.", "NTA.  Go back and stay with your dad full time.. if your mom takes it to court then tell them why you don\u2019t wanna be there. \nYou\u2019re 16. You have a choice if you want to go over or not.

Nope! \n\nThe child is not your responsibility - your mother should not have taken her if she did not have a plan for her care. It would be different if there were a share of the burden with other family/friends but to automatically expect you to watch a toddler everyday for nothing is unacceptable. She can put her in a daycare, have a baby sitter, ask other family as well.\n\nYour life and future should not be put on hold or compromised because they cant come up with a sustainable care plan.", "NTA\n\nThe least your family can do is take your situation into account.  You're trying to offer what support you can, but you have a life too and this ultimately is not your responsibility.", "NTA. Focus on your education.

Yeah, her daycare because she continues to make VERY BAD choices is not your problem. Ffs she\u2019s not even old enough to drink legally. Your mother should be responsible for this, not you.

Do not let your sister's isdued affect your future. Your mother got custody - it is on her to figure out childcare.", "NTA whatsoever. You shouldn't have your education interrupted (which can directly impact your future) because your sister goofed up big time.\n\nBesides that, I really don't get why your mom is defending your sister. Driving drunk kills SO many people, and your niece was in the car when she was driving! I understand alcoholism is hell, but that's totally unacceptable. There might be some child endangerment charges coming your sister's way, so the 'temporary custody' might end up longer than you think. Putting your foot down now will prevent you from becoming the dedicated babysitter.", "NTA: I'm so glad you have your father in your corner. Babysitting or pet sitting is a systemic problem with your mother. You are not free labor. Since you're not there all the time it would be nice if she actually wanted to spend time with you instead of dictating how you spend your time.", "NTA. You're 16. Can your mom take time off? Can your dad help? Any other family on your side nearby or your niece's dad's family? You shouldn't have to fail classes. To expect a 16 year old to take care of a 2 year old, even if it were summer break and you didn't have school, is too big of an ask. There has to be another solution that doesn't involve a minor such as yourself swooping in to save the day.", "NTA", "Nta. You are still a child, you are not responsible for being a stand in mommy. Your sister and mother are adults, childcare responsibilities fall on them.", "NTA I'm not surprised in the slightest to hear yhat you live with your dad. Your mom and sister sounds like entitled AHs. If they expect for you to babysit they'd better start paying you like a babysitter. Alternatively tell them a hard no and don't babysit at all. You have zero obligation here expect to your school studies and yourself.", "NTA.  Three days are more than generous.  Why aren't your sisters chipping in?", "NTA, help for 3 days then get back to your dads. Your sisters and mom are NOT on paths you want to be on and are not supporting you to be your best self.", "NTA not your job at all, you're not the parent", "NTA. She isn't your child or your responsibility, and shoutout to dad for having your back. \n\nThat being said, 3 days might not be enough time to find a full-time sitter, and your niece is still an innocent party. Mom is desperate to keep the baby in a safe environment, and needs everyone to work together. While my gut says \"not your responsibility,\" I'd hate to think what could happen when a child doesn't get proper care.", "NTA\n\nAnd you are 100% correct that you need to take your online classes and should have a break.  Its an all around shitty situation created by your sister and everyone is in a panic mode trying to put out this fire.\n\nI would recommend changing the narrative though, something like \"Mom I'm happy to help as much as I reasonably can.  Reasonably, you agree that my classes are important, right? And reasonably, I need time during the day for them, right?  And I also need time for myself too, right?  I can take these times on these days, but how do we find a way to fill that gap?\"\n\nYou go from saying \"no\" about the times you can't to saying \"yes\" for the times you can.  The \"no\" on the times you can't is implied and you are leading her to think about someone else for those times.\n\nAs a side note: besides hiring a baby sitter another option is that many companies offer daycare services benefits and those daycare services often allow for emergencies even from people who don't use the benefit normally.  Your mom would need to contact the HR department about that.", "NTA\n\nNot your job to watch someone else's kid, but if they literally have no one else then I dont know why you wouldn't help even if you didn't want to or were busy. Not saying making concessions when people are being unreasonable is justified, but if they are really relying on you I'd just bite the bullet tbh. Not everything can go your way all the time. Don't make it the kid's problem too.", "NTA but in your mom\u2019s defense daycare/sitters right now are hard to come by or EXPENSIVE AF I pay 225 a WEEK for my 2yo (definitely not your problem tho lol)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
