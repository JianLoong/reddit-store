You shouldn't have your education interrupted (which can directly impact your future) because your sister goofed up big time.\n\nBesides that, I really don't get why your mom is defending your sister. Driving drunk kills SO many people, and your niece was in the car when she was driving! I understand alcoholism is hell, but that's totally unacceptable. There might be some child endangerment charges coming your sister's way, so the 'temporary custody' might end up longer than you think. Putting your foot down now will prevent you from becoming the dedicated babysitter.", "NTA: I'm so glad you have your father in your corner. Babysitting or pet sitting is a systemic problem with your mother. You are not free labor.

To expect a 16 year old to take care of a 2 year old, even if it were summer break and you didn't have school, is too big of an ask. There has to be another solution that doesn't involve a minor such as yourself swooping in to save the day.", "NTA", "Nta. You are still a child, you are not responsible for being a stand in mommy. Your sister and mother are adults, childcare responsibilities fall on them.", "NTA I'm not surprised in the slightest to hear yhat you live with your dad. Your mom and sister sounds like entitled AHs. If they expect for you to babysit they'd better start paying you like a babysitter. Alternatively tell them a hard no and don't babysit at all. You have zero obligation here expect to your school studies and yourself.", "NTA.  Three days are more than generous.  Why aren't your sisters chipping in?", "NTA, help for 3 days then get back to your dads. Your sisters and mom are NOT on paths you want to be on and are not supporting you to be your best self.", "NTA not your job at all, you're not the parent", "NTA. She isn't your child or your responsibility, and shoutout to dad for having your back. \n\nThat being said, 3 days might not be enough time to find a full-time sitter, and your niece is still an innocent party. Mom is desperate to keep the baby in a safe environment, and needs everyone to work together. While my gut says \"not your responsibility,\" I'd hate to think what could happen when a child doesn't get proper care.", "NTA\n\nAnd you are 100% correct that you need to take your online classes and should have a break.  Its an all around shitty situation created by your sister and everyone is in a panic mode trying to put out this fire.\n\nI would recommend changing the narrative though, something like \"Mom I'm happy to help as much as I reasonably can.  Reasonably, you agree that my classes are important, right? And reasonably, I need time during the day for them, right?  And I also need time for myself too, right?  I can take these times on these days, but how do we find a way to fill that gap?\"\n\nYou go from saying \"no\" about the times you can't to saying \"yes\" for the times you can.  The \"no\" on the times you can't is implied and you are leading her to think about someone else for those times.\n\nAs a side note: besides hiring a baby sitter another option is that many companies offer daycare services benefits and those daycare services often allow for emergencies even from people who don't use the benefit normally.  Your mom would need to contact the HR department about that.", "NTA\n\nNot your job to watch someone else's kid, but if they literally have no one else then I dont know why you wouldn't help even if you didn't want to or were busy. Not saying making concessions when people are being unreasonable is justified, but if they are really relying on you I'd just bite the bullet tbh. Not everything can go your way all the time. Don't make it the kid's problem too.", "NTA but in your mom\u2019s defense daycare/sitters right now are hard to come by or EXPENSIVE AF I pay 225 a WEEK for my 2yo (definitely not your problem tho lol)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Oh OP you are in no way the AH", "And if their mom doesn't have the means to take temporary custody of her grandchild without forcing her teenager to do the majority of the childcare, then she doesn't have the means to take custody. \n\nThis poor baby has a mother who put her life in danger and a grandmother who wants the benefits of taking custody while forcing all of the labor of it onto her other child.", "and having unprotected sex.", "She should check the laws of her state/county. Some places allow the child to refuse visitation after a certain age.", "I think OP is 16, and with a 10-year age gap, that makes the sister 26.", "Not at all really, they say they would but they have their own life. I do as well\u2026.", "This isn't the kid's responsability. Her mother should hire a babysitter and not interfere with OP's education. Her sister should have money (i bet she doesn't pay child care, she needs the money for the next dui) to pay for babbysitting.", "I would, however my little sister lives with my mom and I don\u2019t wanna be the older sister that abandons her because of something our mom is doing.

Who is trying to finish school. Someone may want to point out to Mom that completing school is a hell of lot more important than babysitting. Or report that Mom is not the caretaker of baby. She has dumped that responsibility on a minor who is now at risk of not being to complete school as a result.", " Good luck!", "shaming someone for having a kid is out of line. shame her for being a shit mom, sure, but this comment is gross.", "This can probably be revisited. And since you're 16 your opinion might be taken into account. \n\nEspecially since you are essentially being asked to give up doing school work to watch your niece because your sister got busted for drunk driving. \n\nNot saying that you don't love your niece. But this is not your problem.", "At 16yo you are old enough to decide where you want to live or visit. If you told the judge about how your mother is parentifying you and forcing you to watch a toddler instead of letting you do your school work, that judge would absolutely not make you visit your mom.

I am sure your mom was asked if she can make it her full time job, she likely wouldnt have been given temp custody without being asked first. Your mom doesn't sound like a pleasant person and should stop using the word \"family\" to manipulate people. Even you giving 3 days a week is a lot. Your mom should take responsibility for her own decisions, just like your sister should for risking your niece's life.", " Asking you to compromise your education is not fair."]}
