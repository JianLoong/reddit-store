{"id": 26222, "submission_id": "16a7dk2", "title": "AITA for seeking $$$ from my cousin due to a drain clog caused by her?", "selftext": "I hosted a bbq on Saturday because my cousin mentioned a week in advance she\u2019d be in my area with her family because they had plans to go the waterpark.\nShe has never been to my new house as she doesn\u2019t live near & I was excited for her to see it. She has a 3 & 5 year old.\nI went all out for the bbq \u2014 even bought her kids presents cuz I never see them. She brought such a nice house warming gift & even brought plenty of drinks that she thought Id enjoy. \nHer 3 year old son is in that stage where he drools or makes a mess with his hands. I noticed they used wet wipes with him alot. I didn\u2019t notice where these wet wipes were going, didn\u2019t think much of it.\nFast forward to Monday, 2 days after the bbq, and my bf was brushing his teeth upstairs when I heard the downstairs toilet bubbling. I was like wtf?? But didn\u2019t think much of it.\nHe then hopped in the shower & I heard bubbling sounds from the laundryroom around the corner. I went to take a look & saw water with black stuff all over the floor. It was flooded.\nI quickly ran upstairs to tell my bf to turn off the shower. He went downstairs and saw the mess, let out a few curse words.\nWe called a restoration company, meanwhile cleaning all this dirty water. He confirmed its black water & that the floors need replacing. We would have to file an insurance claim with a $1000 deductible.\nThe plumber is here & was able to run a camera down. He said the clog went 6 feet down & was a bunch of \u201cpaper\u201d. He couldn\u2019t determine whether it was paper towels or wet wipes, but said it wasn\u2019t toilet paper because that breaks down. My boyfriend and I are the only ones who live here & we have never in our lives flushed paper towels. We have never had any issues and have lived here for a year. There really is no proof if these were 100% wet wipes but all evidence in my opinion points to her. I asked her if she flushed anything aside from toilet paper & she said no, but couldn\u2019t speak for her husband. And then she asked if our city pipes were smaller than her city pipes. She definitely flushes these wipes at her own house, which is why she asked that question.\nWould I be an asshole for asking my cousin to pay for at least half the deductible? The grey area is that Im pretty sure her wet wipes say they are flushable? I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t buy them. I have no kids. It\u2019s just my boyfriend and I who live in the house & we never flush anything aside from toilet paper.\nAny thoughts??

It wrecks havoc on your pipes. I think it\u2019s fair for them to as least pitch in to fix the issue they obviously caused.", "NTA.  They really aren't flushable and cities have been trying to get them to stop marketing them like that.", "I think NTA, as it's fairly common knowledge not to flush those, although not everyone seems to know that, and it doesn't help those idiots selling them say they're flushable ffs. Pulled a lot of them out of toilets when I was a plumber and that's how a lot of people learned.", "Adam Ruins Everything has an episode where they talk about flushable wipes.

I'm on the fence here, like, yes in a perfect world she would accept responsibility and offer to help pay for the damage.. Clearly though she already lied and it's extremely unlikely she's going to fess up. So if you do ask her to help financially, probably prepare for it to be a fight. How much value does peace have to you? Might have to put up a sign when guests come over. \u2639\ufe0f Sorry about your floors.", "How is it possible one DAY of flushing wipes completely clogged your sewer line? Are you sure there aren't tree roots as well?\n\nI don't flush wipes either, but it just seems crazy that one DAY of this would completely choke the system.", "I do not think it would effect your system that quick. I have flushed pads and wipes, and my period was Heavy so I was using a lot of wipes with the thick overnight pads. (Don\u2019t yell at me, i was a child and now I got the some of it figured out)\n\nI know that it can effect your system but for it to hit in one day, they would have had to flushed a few box\u2019s worth of wipes. \n\ngreat chance this was a problem before and this was the push it over but it\u2019s not completely their fault.", "It\u2019s sewage", "Me too.", "That\u2019s what I was wondering. If it was because of the wipes, most likely the system was already on its last leg", "Always fun to play in when I was a plumber haha just got all over everything like black ink sometimes, stinky black ink. Everywhere.", "Don't do it. You don't really know the cause. You can kiss this relationship goodbye if you pursue this. It is a question of what is more important, being on good terms with cousin, or $500.00.", "There is not such thing as flushable wipes.  \n\n- signed by Every Single Plumber in the World", "YWBTA. It is possible they flushed some and that contributed to an existing problem, but even if you aren't supposed to flush wet wipes, buildup takes longer than one day of flushing them. And what usually happens is it messes up the city waste collection and piping further down the line, not the piping at your house. It's much more likely you already had a partial blockage - you'd be surprised how often blockages happen even with no obvious culprit. Toilet paper is still a common jam builder when you use an excess, or when you use a thick ply like quilted, etc. My brother is a plumber and he's seen all kinds of stuff you wouldn't expect to be an issue. Piping can also shift over time or because of root growth, and that affects the flow and ability of even common materials to pass.\n\nEven without all that, the sad fact is you have no proof and they haven't even confirmed flushing any wipes at all. So you're in a tough spot. You may have to swallow this now and make a clear rule later to avoid a repeat problem.", "You've only had the house for a year it could have been from the previous homeowner. Also for everyone...even if the wipe says flushable it is NOT flushable", "YWBTA.  You have no proof.  You have a hunch.  I also think the flooring replacement is going overboard.  Since it was caught quickly, usually a thorough cleaning is all that is needed.", "NTH. You are not supposed to flush wet wipes. Regardless of what your cousin says. Those things clog pipes. Even the ones labeled \"flushable\". It is not unreasonable to ask your cousin to pay. I would want them to pay the full amount. It could be that the kids put something in the toilet. You never know. All you know is that it happened during their visit. They should be responsible for the damage. Talk to them. Last resort would be to go to court and to bring documentation from the plumber and the plumber to testify if necessary.", "Even plumbers, who make money off of stuff like this say not to flush \"flushable\" wipes.", "Yeah, unless this is a brand new house, even though they've lived there a year, they can't prove it was the cousin. Do educate them, though, because those darn thing are wreaking havoc on city and town wastewater systems all over the country.", "Sewage.  Grey water is from a shower or sink.  Black water is from a toilet.", "All it takes is one to get snagged and then it\u2019s a short time before there\u2019s more stuck along with other more unpleasant things getting caught up there.", "> Since it was caught quickly, usually a thorough cleaning is all that is needed.\n\nThis is not remotely the case with black water. The amount of time feces is on the floor is irrelevant.", "I think there was a Dirty Jobs episode where they went into the sewers and basically spent ten minutes on the issue that \"flushable\" is BS and that they are a disaster for your plumbing.  \n\nSame thing with cat litter.  My Mom flushed so many clumped cat turds down her toilet she packed her drain solid.  After an $800 plumbing bill she didn't do THAT again.  \n\nJust the lint from the washer was plugging up a 4\" drain pipe in our home.  I was getting it cleaned out every couple of years until the last guy told me to move the drain hose to the laundry sink and to zip tie a nylon stocking to the end to catch all the lint.  Works mint!", "How is it possible you know more than civil engineers and plumbers who say that wet wipes will clog pipes? They don\u2019t say it will cause problems on a system that\u2019s on its last leg. The plumbing isn\u2019t designed for it.", "Of fuck. So that's why people do that??? I have a relative that has that pantyhose set up and always wondered why. TIL. Thanks!", "I had a female roommate with really long hair, used to flush her hair clumps down the toilet. Didn't matter if it was from her hairbrush or from when she took a shower/bath (we had drain covers so these clumps could be prevented from going in the drain and put in the trash instead. Not sure how much of the plumbing issues we've had were from her hair or from tree roots in the system outside our house. Thankfully she only lived in our house for 2 years and we've had our plumbing completely cleaned/repaired/replaced since she moved out. \n\nMaybe it's because I grew up in places where city sewer was old  as well as living out in the country and there was only access to septic, but I always understood there should only ever be water, #1, #2, & toilet paper being flushed - and that's it!! \n\nOP, I don't see you being in the wrong to discuss cousin chipping in for repairs, but be fully prepared for backlash. NTA. Good luck."]}
