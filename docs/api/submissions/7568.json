When I was 6 she married her husband who's ex-wife had died weeks before (my aunt's husband was divorced and they were already engaged at the time). My aunt's husband has two sons Jax and Rocco who are 17 and 19 now but were 7 and 9 when they got married and I'm not sure how long they were together before that. My aunt's stepsons don't really like my aunt. Jax is in college now and I don't think he's really spoken to my aunt or his dad since he moved out. Rocco still lives with them but he pretty much acts like he lives alone. I hear all about this shit when my aunt and mom hang out. My aunt also has Cam who's 6 with her husband and they lost baby Paige four years ago (she was stillborn).\n\nSo anyway, it's never been hard for me to see that Jax and Rocco didn't really like my aunt and it was never hard to tell my aunt considered them her sons and not her stepsons. She'd call them her boys a lot and she used to tell people she had two sons before Cam was born and now she says she has three sons and a daughter. I remember once asking why the boys called my aunt by her name and not mom since she was always saying they were her sons. I would have maybe been 7ish at the time. She and mom told me that the boys were being grumpy and that they'd start to call her mom eventually. It was later that year I became better aware of stepfamilies because my best friend's parents divorced and she told me how she didn't see her mom's husband as her dad or second dad. So I got a better understanding. But Rocco told me a few years ago that my aunt and her husband had them in family therapy and my aunt said she wanted a more loving relationship with them but Jax and him didn't want that and always kind of planned to just keep her at a distance.\n\nThe last few months my aunt has started to realize that despite all her talk, neither of the boys give a shit about her. Mother's Day was when it started because Jax didn't call and got pissed off at his dad when he called him out a couple of days later for not calling my aunt and Rocco refused to celebrate with them and was grounded for refusing to acknowledge my aunt. Ever since she has seemed less certain and vents way more. So my mom and aunt dragged me for a road trip last weekend and they were talking about it non-stop and my mom kept assuring my aunt that she might not be their bio mom but she raised them and deep down they love her but teenagers can be insensitive and not always grateful. It started to get a lot and my aunt was like oh yeah, one day I'll be grandma and all this will be different and I told them that they should start listening to Jax and Rocco and she should work on accepting she will always be a stepmom and a mom and not just a mom. My mom and aunt were so angry with me and they told me it was an adult topic I couldn't understand and when I didn't apologize and say I was wrong, they kept being angry at me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673961919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ec7bi/aita_for_telling_my_mom_and_my_aunt_that_i_think/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not only did she get mad about it, but she proceeded to sulk and ignore me for the next three days, going out of her way to show me she was still mad about it.\n\nLesson learned: adults don't like hearing the truth.

You can't make people feel the same about you and it only hurts more when you pretend they do. I know that from experience.", "Sorry that wasn't clear. My aunt was never married before her husband. He was divorced and they'd been dating and engaged a while when his ex-wife died.", "How do you expect your aunt to \"let go\" of her husband's children and her son's step siblings? Her situation is much more involved than your \"friend\" thing.", "She needs to let go of the idea that she's their mom. She might even need to let go of the idea that she'll be known as grandma to their kids. Jax and Rocco do not care about her and don't want to make their relationship with her closer than it is. Maybe she can't let go the same way I did with the person I thought of as a friend. But every time she keeps trying to tell herself she's their mom or when she becomes invested in trying harder, she just gets hurt when they show they don't feel that way about her. Mother's Day was always forced. But it was also the first one where Rocco wasn't home and Jax didn't have his brother there so he chose to get into trouble rather than celebrate the day with her. I think that says a lot and yet I know she and my mom have still mentioned how next Mother's Day will be different.\n\nNone of this will help her. She's just fixating on this and of course it hurts her but we have to find acceptance in the truth otherwise we set ourselves up for years of hurt."]}
