She'd call them her boys a lot and she used to tell people she had two sons before Cam was born and now she says she has three sons and a daughter. I remember once asking why the boys called my aunt by her name and not mom since she was always saying they were her sons. I would have maybe been 7ish at the time.

You can't make people feel the same about you and it only hurts more when you pretend they do. I know that from experience.", "Sorry that wasn't clear. My aunt was never married before her husband. He was divorced and they'd been dating and engaged a while when his ex-wife died.", "How do you expect your aunt to \"let go\" of her husband's children and her son's step siblings? Her situation is much more involved than your \"friend\" thing.", "She needs to let go of the idea that she's their mom. She might even need to let go of the idea that she'll be known as grandma to their kids. Jax and Rocco do not care about her and don't want to make their relationship with her closer than it is. Maybe she can't let go the same way I did with the person I thought of as a friend. But every time she keeps trying to tell herself she's their mom or when she becomes invested in trying harder, she just gets hurt when they show they don't feel that way about her. Mother's Day was always forced. But it was also the first one where Rocco wasn't home and Jax didn't have his brother there so he chose to get into trouble rather than celebrate the day with her. I think that says a lot and yet I know she and my mom have still mentioned how next Mother's Day will be different.\n\nNone of this will help her.

I mean you are not an adult yet, but you are getting there and seem to have it figured out already! Being around the same age as the boys, and having a friend that was in the same situation, you obviously are more aware of what your peers perspectives are.

I smell hypocrisy here.", "NTA", "NTA but I'd keep that opinion to yourself, they obviously don't want to hear it", "NTA. You can force your own expectations on other people. It sounds like your aunt's stepsons have made it abundantly clear that they don't want that sort of relationship with her.

Their own dad can\u2019t get them to change their minds about her. They got angry because there\u2019s truth in what you said.

So, boys have less point, though I suspect they feel like dad's marriage was hasty, even though the divorce makes it unrelated, time-wise.\n\nIt does hold true that stepmother tried to erase their mother by assuming they'd instantly accept her.", "NTA but now you know to not talk about things like that to your aunt", "Why in your opinion do Jax and Rocco decide to keep her at a distance?  Why didn\u2019t they call her on Mother\u2019s Day or acknowledge her?   If I am reading your post correctly she\u2019s always treated them as though they were own flesh and blood, has she done anything to deserve being treated with such ignorance and contempt (non-contact, behaving as thought they live alone)?  It sounds that Jax and Rocco ATA.\n\nBy way way, I don\u2019t think YTA but I do think you delivered your unsolicited opinion on the matter rather bluntly and insensitively.  Your Aunt is already feeling rejected and upset, on top of which you squashed her hope for a happy outcome.  Telling her that \u2018she needs to work on accepting\u2026\u2019 implies that she is to an extent an architect of this situation and it\u2019s her behaviour that needs to change.", "Your mom is enabling your aunts fantasies about her being a mom to the boys and someday a grandma.

I\u2019m sorry that you have found yourself involved in this situation, but unfortunately it has blown up in your face.  Sometimes it turns out that being right about something can be uncomfortable and unpleasant, and in that way there are no winners here.  Your aunt is simply not yet ready to accept the truth - that they\u2019re just not that into her.  It\u2019s sad because I\u2019ve no doubt that she put a lot of hope and work into trying to cultivate those relationships.  Also, your mother probably knows this truth as well but it is still trying to spare her feelings by being tactful.  So I think that the reason that your mother is angry with you is not the same as your aunt\u2019s. This is how this will play out:  Far from you not understanding the situation on the grounds of you being too young, you are technically correct, and you know this because of your discussions with one of those stepsons.  In the fullness of time, when the second of the stepsons moves away and doesn\u2019t bother to keep in touch with her, at that time you will be vindicated.  Your aunt\u2019s decades long delusions will be exposed.  However, this is not going to be something you can celebrate.  As I said at the top, there are no winners here, and no trophy.", "NTA\n\nIt's interesting that they said it was an adult conversation you wouldn't understand. Often step-kids are teenage, when their feelings solidify about the step-parent. You can actually identify a lot more with their feelings than the adults.", "NTA. Your aunt and mother are delusional.

Of course they want nothing to do with her.", "I\u2019m super confused by these posts where people get remarried when their kids are young and they act like the step parent is a stranger. I totally understand not forcing a relationship but this person raised you and became a part of the family. From the post it doesn\u2019t sound like your aunt was unkind to them. Step parents can absolutely be parents. My step dad IS my father. What your mom & aunt were saying wasn\u2019t unreasonable. YTA for getting involved in something that isn\u2019t your business.", "Working in sales/customer service, you are spot on. Most clients just want to be listened to and appeased. Like as much as I enjoy hearing about how bad your renovation is going on your vacation home, do you want to buy this or not Carol!?", "her aunt need to realise that she won't be their mom", "Step-parents *can* be parents, yes, but trying to force a close relationship on them within a short time of their mom dying is the most effective way to make sure those kids will never feel comfortable around her. She was technically being nice, but that's the bare minimum of how anyone should treat any other person, it does not entitle her to a parent/child relationship with children who were clearly grieving and uncomfortable with her pushing things.", "Also, it's inherently \\*not\\* an adult topic considering that the aunt's problem stems from not listening to what the teenagers she considers to be her sons need out of the relationship (rather than what she as an adult wants out of it).

Again, unnecessary and unkind, and ultimately serving no purpose at all.", "Your mom was comforting your aunt lol. They don\u2019t need your negative clueless take on the situation.  YTA", "NTA. You're a wise kid. Some kids are not going to accept a step parent. And that's fine. They shouldn't be forced to. Its great that your aunt loves them and they can be her boys to her. But she will never be mom to them and she does need to accept that.", "NTA\n\nAs I've said about a million times before on stories like this, there is nothing wrong with being a stepparent.

You can not just swan in right after their mother died and be all \"I'm your mom now\".  Like, seriously?  That's messed up.", "NTA\n\nI'm from a blended family. Our stepmom didn't want US rather than us not wanting her. We had to accept it just wasn't going to happen.
