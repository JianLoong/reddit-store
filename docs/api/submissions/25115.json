I know no one is blameless in this situation, however I don't feel like I own the lions share.\n\nI've told my partners' son Chad not to ride this bike/scooter between the cars. To be clear, he has room to ride where we live, I'm just asking him to walk the bike 10 yards or so instead of riding out of the garage past the cars. He continued doing it and scratched Kates car a couple months ago. She acted like it was no big deal and said \"it's just the cost of being a parent.\" I asked her to make it a rule, no biking by the cars. She refused and told me I'm being too strict on a little boy.\n\nChad just scratched thee living fuck out of my car, like without being dramatic I could get a dime stuck in it, he also dented it. I  jumped up to check it out, when i saw it, i was instantly furious. I smacked the roof of my car and YELLED \"get your ass inside you're in a time out!!!\" at Chad, I shouted in a way they're not used to hearing from me so it was extra shocking for everyone I'm sure. Chad starts crying and Kate it livid with me saying im not her sons father and have no right to yell at him. \n\nI was angry told her \"all of this is your fucking fault, you own every bit of it. You refuse to set rules and I'm the one thats going to suffer because of it.\" we're not talking; she also never offered to pay for my car or made Chad say sorry. Am i the asshole?\n\nUPDATE: Thank you very much to every single person who replied. I never was under the deillusion that I was not an asshole in this situation. My partner just made me feel as if she had no share of the blame, and I needed another perspective if this was correct.\n\nI don't know if this relationship is going to move forward. Kate and Chad just came back from the store, and he got a new toy and gumballs for his mini gumball machine since he had \"such a rough day.\" This felt overly insulting and as if poor behavior and damage to my property were being rewarded. \n\nChad seems to forgive and forget, as young kids will. I asked him if he could forgive me and he does, he even asked if i would come outside and watch him ride his bike.....right past the cars. I kept my mouth shut because thats what his mother wants.", "created_utc": 1692550152, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wgdao/aita_shouted_at_partners_child/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yelling at a 5 year old isn't cool. \n\n\nThe problem is Kate, who wants you as a partner for herself while not allowing you to parent her child even though y'all are living together as a family unit. \n\n\nI think you need to be allowed to parent Chad inasmuch as him being a person you can stand to live with. If you're expected to bear \"the cost\" of being a parent, you have the right to set the rules as a parent.", "NTA\n\nKate refuses to set enforceable boundaries, discipline her child or pay for damages he has caused.  \n\nHe's 5 now.  Do you really want to stick around for the consequences of Kate's permissive parenting?\n\nTalk to Kate.  If she doesn't step up soon, it's time to move on, no matter how much you \"love\" her.\n\nYou deserve better than this.\n\nGood Luck", "Didn't do yourself any favors here by yelling but the bigger picture is there seems to be some compatability issues with your parenting. This will never change. Either accept it or move on. \n\nAlso as a dad that used to get mad and loud. It's not the most effective way. I can look at my son with the stink eye and get a better response than when I used to get mad.", "ESH - you know you shouldn\u2019t have yelled. I\u2019m a parent, and I\u2019ve yelled. We all do it. Just apologize to him. Your partner is a solid AH for allowing this to continue. You made a reasonable request that was ignored.", "ESH, but you\u2019re the lesser AH\n\nYeah, you shouldn\u2019t have yelled at the kid. And you should apologize to him for the yelling (but not for being angry that he damaged your car). Frankly, it\u2019s not terrible for a kid to realize that adults are people too, who get upset if you push them far enough and make mistakes.\n\nKate is the worse AH. You are absolutely correct that her parenting is terrible. She let her kid do several thousand dollars in damage to your car\u2014in a way that was entirely predictable. She didn\u2019t apologize, didn\u2019t discipline her kid, and isn\u2019t planning on paying for it. Kate does not respect you or your belongings. What happens when her kid breaks your laptop? Or a video game system? Or part of the house? How many thousands of dollars is her kid going to cost you? \n\nAlso, are you planning to have kids with this woman? Do you want kids that act like this If you have kids with her, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get. She\u2019s not going to let you set rules for kids that are yours either.", "NTA. You\u2019ve already said in multiple comments you made a mistake by yelling at Chad. I think calling losing your cool at thousands of dollars worth of damage one time abusive is a bit of overkill and that Kate should leave you immediately is just silly. Clearly everyone on here commenting as such are perfect emotional specimens and should be envied, but in my humble opinion- you\u2019re human and you\u2019ve owned it. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll learn from this. Not a red flag IMO. \nHowever, the crux of the problem here is a conflict in parenting values. A post I read recently resonated with me and said it\u2019s unfair for the step parent to be expected to provide emotional and financial support, but be banned from behaviour management. This was an entirely preventable occurrence, and I would be furious too. If I could offer some advice, I would suggest once you\u2019ve both cooled down to really communicate with each other about how this is going to work moving forward. I think you need to put forward your concerns and needs and see if you guys can get on the same page about this. If this is too hard, then perhaps therapy can help you with the strategies needed. If she doesn\u2019t want you to discipline her child, that\u2019s her choice, but it doesn\u2019t mean you have to accept it and \u2018put up with it\u2019. \nI don\u2019t think you should break up immediately, but I do worry based on what you\u2019ve said that the car is only the beginning. What message does this send to Chad about your role in his life? And what happens when something worse happens? Which given that Chad will become a teenager eventually, is likely to happen. \nUltimately, without addressing this, I fear resentment towards both Kate and Chad will escalate to the point where it may be really difficult to fix. Those are the red flags I see. I reckon you guys may be able to sort this out with some better communication and some compromises. Good luck, OP!", "esh. fundamentally you are madder at kate because she didn't support your rule and gotten Chad to follow it. kate doesn't see you as a parent to chad. but she ought to pay for the damage her child caused.\n\nyelling at a 5yo is hardly going to help.", "NTA, so many people commenting seem to think children shouldn't be disciplined by reading the comments, and have no idea how expensive cars and car repairs are. Your partner is the AH in this situation, she clearly doesn't want to set boundaries for her kid, laughing off expensive damage and refusing to use the scratches on her car as a lesson has lead to what happened. Children don't understand how expensive things are and won't get the concept of consequences for their actions if examples aren't made. \n\n\nSure, shouting at a kid isn't great, but we all got yelled at during our childhood and it helps us understand boundaries and consequences.", "NTA. It\u2019s true you shouldn\u2019t have yelled but it can\u2019t be helped in some situations.

If she can\u2019t even enforce such a simple rule on a 5 year old that kid is going to grow up to be a nightmare.", "ESH -- if you're going to be in this kids life you might want to look into conscious parenting or something. Kids need adults who keep their cool.", "ESH\n\nKate for spoiling Chad to his own detriment and you for actually being mad at Kate, but yelling at Chad. \n\nThe real issue is her lack of parenting, the cost of being a parent? That\u2019s the cost of being stupid tbh. \n\nYou weren\u2019t an asshole until you yelled at Chad, you two need to break up. \n\nWTF?", "ESH. Kid needs rules and Mom needs to set some.

She shouldn\u2019t have let the kid play there but the kid is 5. This was all on the mom and you shouldn\u2019t have taken it out on the kid at all.", "ESH. You have anger issues. Her parenting is too permissive, which is causing monetary damages and, more important, is not safe for the kid. Her \"cost of being a parent\" attitude is particularly BS, because which is it? Do *you* have to bear the cost of being a parent? If so, then she doesn't get to tell you you're not his parent and can't tell him what to do: yes, if you bear the cost, you get to tell him what to do to avoid incurring damages. If she stands by the \"you're not his parent\" thing, then she owes you the cost of the repairs, as the only parent of the child who caused the damages. Overall, maybe give some thought to how well this relationship is working out for you.", "ESH\n\nShe should have made it a rule, it was dumb of her not to. But you are a total asshole for yellimg at a child like that, their parent or not.\n\nPoor kid.", "YTA. \n\nFirst of all, what damage he caused on *her* car is her business, and if she decides it's no big deal, then it's no big deal. \n\nThe damage to your own car sucks, and is partially his fault, but at the same time, you knew he had a habit of biking there and you continued to park your car there, anyway. \n\nScolding him or even grounding him (with his mother's permission) would have been justified. Yelling and slamming things aggressively was not.", "Wow.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Your yelling and aggressive behavior (smacking the roof of the car) is not something she should allow around her child. Get anger management treatment, it is not appropriate to react that way to a five year old.\n\nETA your language was inappropriate as well.", "YTA. That is an unacceptable way to talk to a young child, especially one that is not your own. I would advise Kate to end the relationship as this is a red flag.\n\nYes she should pay for the damage her son caused to your car. And that should be the last time she interacts with you.", "YTA, don\u2019t yell at children, there\u2019s never a good reason. You clearly have some anger issues, you\u2019re verbally abusive to her child and to her?\n\nYou have no right to speak to her child that way, if you\u2019re not a father figure, you don\u2019t get to parent the child, he\u2019s 5, he\u2019ll make mistakes, he won\u2019t understand cause and effect, he doesn\u2019t understand scratched cars or what an issue that is. You\u2019re incredibly toxic, you clearly don\u2019t know how to parent. You shouldn\u2019t be with someone with a child.\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have to pay for your car, she didn\u2019t destroy it, and the child shouldn\u2019t have to apologise to an abusive asshole.\n\nYTA, no question about it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Kids need to learn that there are rules. I have 4 kids and my kids know what the rules are. Rules are in place so things don\u2019t get broken or messed up or people don\u2019t get hurt. In this case something so simple as not riding close to the cars would have protected your car and hers. In my experience, parents who let kids be kids usually have a tore up home. Messed up couches or walls all drawn on. Instead if rules like food belongs at the table or coloring belongs on paper. What\u2019s so hard about having a hard rule of food stays in the kitchen/dining room and not on the couch. For your case. What was so hard about establishing that riding is not allowed close to cars.

You can say/ yell stop riding between the cars, until you\u2019re blue in the face, but the fact you haven\u2019t explained the why and the delivery caused it to be ignored. Kate should have stepped up and explain why as well, as it\u2019s a reasonable request. You\u2019re both contradicting each other to the point the kid probably don\u2019t even know what\u2019s what.", "ESH except Chad who is a child. \n\nScaring people in order to control them is what bullies do. Yelling at kids scares them. \n\nYou\u2019re talking about Chad as if he\u2019s a fifteen year old. I\u2019m sure he has been told. He\u2019s also a five year old. He\u2019s just mastering not pooping his pants every day. You have to keep your expectations of his capacity for reason and impulse control pretty low. \n\nIt\u2019s also not clear that no riding by the cars was set down as a firm rule so it was fully an accident that happened while as far as he knew he was playing within the rules. \n\nChad was set up to fail.", "Yelling \"get your ass inside\" is so not ok. Not only did you cuss at a 5 year old you yelled it. Like yikes. Maybe some anger management and parenting classes? And if you arent allowed to parent then she needs to pay for damages. ESH. I wouldn't want you to parent my kid either.", "Honestly as a dad, you would've had to beat my ass. It's ok to be emotional but it's not okay to disrespect. \n\nNow as a man, playas fuck up to. Apologize and explain that it was a bad reaction and just do better. Not the end of the world but not anything you want to make a habit out of. \n\nYou was the asshole but you can turn it around!!!!", "Nta- you asked multiple times so nothing would happen. Something finally happened and you snapped? It fucking happens. You're not a monster for getting mad. Did you hit the child? Call him stupid? No.", "ESH for obvious reasons. But I think the larger problem here is you and Kate don\u2019t agree on your role in his life and parenting in general. Once everyone cools down you need to have a serious discussion about this.", "ESH. You took your anger out on the five year old, when really the problem is Kate\u2019s refusal to enforce simple, reasonable rules with her child. The damage to the cars was easily preventable, with no cost to the kid - he could still ride his bike once he was past them - but little kids aren\u2019t especially prone to forward thinking. Your T A for losing it at a small child. Kate is a bigger A H for setting her kid up to fail.", "ESH. Yes yelling at a 5 year old is an asshole thing to do but I think you\u2019re a justified asshole. Sometimes people on AITA think you\u2019re not allowed to lose your temper ever. That little shit fucked up your car after you explicitly gave him instructions. Does Kate refuse to ever hold him accountable?", "ESH \n\nYelling at the kids doesn't do anything but let you let out your anger and frustration on a 5 year old. Doesn't fix the situation, doesn't get him to learn, just you yelling at a child. \n\nShe's coddling him.", "NTA. Your gf is the problem. At some point she will have to unleash her son onto society, and society won't accept his behavior. Children both *need* and *want* boundaries. Instead of giving him boundaries, she's buying him toys and candy every time he does something wrong. Boy, what a shock it'll be for him 15-20 years from now, when society starts trying to corrct his behavior by--oh, I don't know--_**sending him to prison**_.", "NAH, your partner is though, she needs to set rules and boundaries for her son, not buy him treats after he damages a car. If that had been a car in the street belonging to a neighbour she would most definitely be paying for the repairs. Get your car repaired and hand her the bill.", "if you guys share expenses, but keep ur $$ separate she should absolutely pay yr car repair.", "Kate needs to pay for the repairs to your car. Also, she needs to teach him rules and consequences. A lack of rules and consequences will mess this child up as he gets older", "> NTA\n\nI agree with some of your post, but you didn't explain why you think it's OK for OP to yell and swear at a 5 year old.", "This is her house. She purchased it 2 years ago before we lived together. We do share expenses. I pay my half by covering all ultilties and then a cash/venmo payment to her for the difference in 50/50. For example, her mortgage is $1700, making my half $850; this month, the utilities ran $390, I paid them, then gave her $460 in cash. \n\nIt ends up making our actual financial split closer to 60/40 with Kate paying more. We agree to that simply because I have nor want any claim to the house should we split, and I also do all the mowing, weed eating, gutter cleaning, and general maintenance. Our banking is done completely seperate, and we don't mix money.", "If the yelling is an isolated incident, I would absolutely recommend you sitting him and Kate down, and explaining it. It will go a long, long way to apologize for your reaction, that even though what he did was upsetting, that you should not have yelled at him. I would not hesitate to tell a child my yelling was selfish and immature. Then pay attention to not letting any resentment creep through.\n\nThis isn't Chad's fault, and from your replies, you know that. Like others have said, I would immediately apologize to Chad, and then evaluate whether or not you can live by her rules. Would couples therapy be an option for you to hash out your differences with a \"moderator\"?\n\nIn an ideal world, she I'd hope she would be willing to pay for the damage if she is also not willing to share any parenting decisions with you. But I don't think I'm knowledgeable enough to comment more on what's fair between the two of you adults.", "This response shows me that you are going to be ok, shit happens just be glad it's shit you can come back from", "partners especially do not get to discipline their partner's children. but I don't think yelling is discipline, sure it would hv been better not to hv yelled, but most of us would lose it if the kid did damage after being told repeatedly not to ride bet the cars.", "OP has already stated that he sat down and apologized for his reactive yell, and explained to both the mother and the child that he felt his yelling was not okay. Emotions are a fact of life, and sometimes, you can't always control how they come out.\n\nIn fact, there are studies shown that having perfect self control over emotional outbursts can actually be a sign of an unhealthy mentality. Even gentle parenting experts like Gwenna have been known to lose their shit occasionally. This doesn't mean that he should never have authority over a child.", "Becoming a step parent is the worst thing I have ever done to myself and my personal well being. Take your messed up car and drive off into the sunset, seriously. IT DOES NOT GET BETTER and she is telling you explicitly who she is and where your needs fall on the priority list.\n\nSpelling edit.", "If you don't want kids, why are you with someone who has a child?", "Growing up many parents where I lived would move their cars to the street if they didn't want them near where kids were playing (and kept the kids running around in the driveway instead of the street).", "Hey OP, stepkid here. I have a good relationship with my stepdad and love and respect him like a second father. But he doesn\u2019t get to discipline me and never has\u2014 though because of how much I respect him, just talking to me has usually worked to resolve things just dandily.\n\nThe only reason that works is because my mother is, and has always been, an effective parent. Not overly strict, but not overly permissive either. For a stepparent to be respected and able to integrate into a household with existing kids, the bio parent *has* to step up. There is no other way.\n\nKate is not stepping up. That is not Chad\u2019s fault, but he will unfortunately grow up to suffer for being raised that way. It also means that you as a partner has no power in this relationship, because Kate does not respect your feelings or your belongings, and so does not listen when you reasonably advocate for yourself.\n\nWith respect to how this situation affects you, this is not sustainable. Even if she started listening to your concerns tomorrow, the real damage being done is caused by the fact that Kate is simply not a good parent and doesn\u2019t seem to understand what being a good parent involves. She\u2019s trying to be Chad\u2019s best friend and \u201cthe cool mom\u201d, and is failing at doing the harder aspects of parenting. \n\nBeing a stepdad with a good parent is hard. Being a stepdad with a *bad* parent is impossible.", "Time out like that doesn't work at all, ya also need to be consistent with it.
