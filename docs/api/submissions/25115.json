Yelling at a 5 year old isn't cool. \n\n\nThe problem is Kate, who wants you as a partner for herself while not allowing you to parent her child even though y'all are living together as a family unit. \n\n\nI think you need to be allowed to parent Chad inasmuch as him being a person you can stand to live with. If you're expected to bear \"the cost\" of being a parent, you have the right to set the rules as a parent.", "NTA\n\nKate refuses to set enforceable boundaries, discipline her child or pay for damages he has caused.  \n\nHe's 5 now.  Do you really want to stick around for the consequences of Kate's permissive parenting?\n\nTalk to Kate.  If she doesn't step up soon, it's time to move on, no matter how much you \"love\" her.\n\nYou deserve better than this.\n\nGood Luck", "Didn't do yourself any favors here by yelling but the bigger picture is there seems to be some compatability issues with your parenting. This will never change. Either accept it or move on. \n\nAlso as a dad that used to get mad and loud. It's not the most effective way. I can look at my son with the stink eye and get a better response than when I used to get mad.", "ESH - you know you shouldn\u2019t have yelled. I\u2019m a parent, and I\u2019ve yelled. We all do it. Just apologize to him. Your partner is a solid AH for allowing this to continue. You made a reasonable request that was ignored.", "ESH, but you\u2019re the lesser AH\n\nYeah, you shouldn\u2019t have yelled at the kid. And you should apologize to him for the yelling (but not for being angry that he damaged your car). Frankly, it\u2019s not terrible for a kid to realize that adults are people too, who get upset if you push them far enough and make mistakes.\n\nKate is the worse AH. You are absolutely correct that her parenting is terrible. She let her kid do several thousand dollars in damage to your car\u2014in a way that was entirely predictable. She didn\u2019t apologize, didn\u2019t discipline her kid, and isn\u2019t planning on paying for it. Kate does not respect you or your belongings. What happens when her kid breaks your laptop? Or a video game system? Or part of the house? How many thousands of dollars is her kid going to cost you? \n\nAlso, are you planning to have kids with this woman? Do you want kids that act like this If you have kids with her, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get. She\u2019s not going to let you set rules for kids that are yours either.", "NTA. You\u2019ve already said in multiple comments you made a mistake by yelling at Chad. I think calling losing your cool at thousands of dollars worth of damage one time abusive is a bit of overkill and that Kate should leave you immediately is just silly. Clearly everyone on here commenting as such are perfect emotional specimens and should be envied, but in my humble opinion- you\u2019re human and you\u2019ve owned it. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll learn from this. Not a red flag IMO. \nHowever, the crux of the problem here is a conflict in parenting values. A post I read recently resonated with me and said it\u2019s unfair for the step parent to be expected to provide emotional and financial support, but be banned from behaviour management. This was an entirely preventable occurrence, and I would be furious too. If I could offer some advice, I would suggest once you\u2019ve both cooled down to really communicate with each other about how this is going to work moving forward. I think you need to put forward your concerns and needs and see if you guys can get on the same page about this. If this is too hard, then perhaps therapy can help you with the strategies needed. If she doesn\u2019t want you to discipline her child, that\u2019s her choice, but it doesn\u2019t mean you have to accept it and \u2018put up with it\u2019. \nI don\u2019t think you should break up immediately, but I do worry based on what you\u2019ve said that the car is only the beginning. What message does this send to Chad about your role in his life? And what happens when something worse happens? Which given that Chad will become a teenager eventually, is likely to happen. \nUltimately, without addressing this, I fear resentment towards both Kate and Chad will escalate to the point where it may be really difficult to fix. Those are the red flags I see. I reckon you guys may be able to sort this out with some better communication and some compromises. Good luck, OP!", "esh. fundamentally you are madder at kate because she didn't support your rule and gotten Chad to follow it. kate doesn't see you as a parent to chad. but she ought to pay for the damage her child caused.\n\nyelling at a 5yo is hardly going to help.", "NTA, so many people commenting seem to think children shouldn't be disciplined by reading the comments, and have no idea how expensive cars and car repairs are. Your partner is the AH in this situation, she clearly doesn't want to set boundaries for her kid, laughing off expensive damage and refusing to use the scratches on her car as a lesson has lead to what happened. Children don't understand how expensive things are and won't get the concept of consequences for their actions if examples aren't made. \n\n\nSure, shouting at a kid isn't great, but we all got yelled at during our childhood and it helps us understand boundaries and consequences.", "NTA. It\u2019s true you shouldn\u2019t have yelled but it can\u2019t be helped in some situations. If you aren\u2019t able to parent him then his mum should and it doesn\u2019t look like she wants to.", "YTA. Yelling never helps. It\u2019s hard to remain calm sometimes, but that\u2019s really what you need to do.", "YTA you shouldn\u2019t have yelled at a child", "Dude she needs to raise that boy properly.  If she can\u2019t even enforce such a simple rule on a 5 year old that kid is going to grow up to be a nightmare.", "ESH -- if you're going to be in this kids life you might want to look into conscious parenting or something. Kids need adults who keep their cool.", "ESH\n\nKate for spoiling Chad to his own detriment and you for actually being mad at Kate, but yelling at Chad. \n\nThe real issue is her lack of parenting, the cost of being a parent? That\u2019s the cost of being stupid tbh. \n\nYou weren\u2019t an asshole until you yelled at Chad, you two need to break up. \n\nWTF?", "ESH. Kid needs rules and Mom needs to set some. On the other hand, kid is also 5, so swearing at him is uncalled for. \n\nI am a bit surprised that he is allowed to play on the road at that age without being closely supervised.", "[deleted]", "YTA - your reaction was frightening and wildly out of line.", "Esh except chad", "Yta you aren\u2019t ready to be a parent especially with your partner. She shouldn\u2019t have let the kid play there but the kid is 5. This was all on the mom and you shouldn\u2019t have taken it out on the kid at all.", "ESH. You have anger issues. Her parenting is too permissive, which is causing monetary damages and, more important, is not safe for the kid. Her \"cost of being a parent\" attitude is particularly BS, because which is it? Do *you* have to bear the cost of being a parent? If so, then she doesn't get to tell you you're not his parent and can't tell him what to do: yes, if you bear the cost, you get to tell him what to do to avoid incurring damages. If she stands by the \"you're not his parent\" thing, then she owes you the cost of the repairs, as the only parent of the child who caused the damages. Overall, maybe give some thought to how well this relationship is working out for you.", "ESH\n\nShe should have made it a rule, it was dumb of her not to. But you are a total asshole for yellimg at a child like that, their parent or not.\n\nPoor kid.", "YTA. \n\nFirst of all, what damage he caused on *her* car is her business, and if she decides it's no big deal, then it's no big deal. \n\nThe damage to your own car sucks, and is partially his fault, but at the same time, you knew he had a habit of biking there and you continued to park your car there, anyway. \n\nScolding him or even grounding him (with his mother's permission) would have been justified. Yelling and slamming things aggressively was not.", "Wow.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Your yelling and aggressive behavior (smacking the roof of the car) is not something she should allow around her child. Get anger management treatment, it is not appropriate to react that way to a five year old.\n\nETA your language was inappropriate as well.", "YTA. That is an unacceptable way to talk to a young child, especially one that is not your own. I would advise Kate to end the relationship as this is a red flag.\n\nYes she should pay for the damage her son caused to your car. And that should be the last time she interacts with you.", "YTA, don\u2019t yell at children, there\u2019s never a good reason. You clearly have some anger issues, you\u2019re verbally abusive to her child and to her?\n\nYou have no right to speak to her child that way, if you\u2019re not a father figure, you don\u2019t get to parent the child, he\u2019s 5, he\u2019ll make mistakes, he won\u2019t understand cause and effect, he doesn\u2019t understand scratched cars or what an issue that is. You\u2019re incredibly toxic, you clearly don\u2019t know how to parent. You shouldn\u2019t be with someone with a child.\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have to pay for your car, she didn\u2019t destroy it, and the child shouldn\u2019t have to apologise to an abusive asshole.\n\nYTA, no question about it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Kids need to learn that there are rules. I have 4 kids and my kids know what the rules are. Rules are in place so things don\u2019t get broken or messed up or people don\u2019t get hurt. In this case something so simple as not riding close to the cars would have protected your car and hers. In my experience, parents who let kids be kids usually have a tore up home. Messed up couches or walls all drawn on. Instead if rules like food belongs at the table or coloring belongs on paper. What\u2019s so hard about having a hard rule of food stays in the kitchen/dining room and not on the couch. For your case. What was so hard about establishing that riding is not allowed close to cars. Next it\u2019ll be your neighbors car or a strangers car and they\u2019ll be out there beating the shit out of her kid coz she couldn\u2019t establish rules for him.

I put him to bed and do nightly reading at least once a week. Pick him up from school/baby sitters/ play dates.\n\nThis isn't a weird situation where I pretend he doesn't exist.
