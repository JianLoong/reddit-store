He had this beautiful girlfriend who he stupidly cheated on and broke her heart. Her mother had called me about what my son did and I confronted him and stopped talking to him for a week then insisted that he goes to apologize to his girlfriend and her mother and to cut ties with his mistress which he did but  his girlfriend and his mother didn\u2019t accept his apology\n\n&#x200B;\n\n.Later after 2 months passed I called them in and had Jason apologize again which they still didn\u2019t accept and I understand and respect their decision my son was an asshole in this and I always reminded him how stupid he was for wasting this beautiful gem and taking her for granted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1 year  have passed our ties are non-existent but we follow each other on instagram so I see and they see what I post. Last week , Jason and I went to an Italian restaurant together we ate and had fun something we promised to always do since his father left us because his father used to take us out in this restaurant, he loved it so much and I love it too. It\u2019s what reminds us of him the most and makes us feel his soul. We took a selfie and I posted it then his ex-girlfriend called me on phone and called me a misogynistic woman for supporting a cheater that I am the reason Jason cheated on her. I didn\u2019t answer her and hung up. I never supported Jason\u2019s  actions and I never told him it is okay to cheat. I can\u2019t disown my son or cut ties with him forever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I a bad mother really for hanging out with my son ?", "created_utc": 1692661031, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xo626/aita_for_hanging_out_with_my_son_who_cheated_on/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes he's an ass for cheating but that isn't a reason for him to lose his relationship with his mother. The fact his ex has acted like this ans spoke to you this way. He is well off out of that relationship. \n\nGoing forward I would unfollow the ex and make sure she is no longer following you.", "NTA - There are very few reasons why a parent should completely cut contact with their children. Infidelity as a young adult is not one of them. Family typically comes first.\n\nThe girlfriend's unhinged reaction to insult and abuse you may also reveal the type of partner she was to your son.", "NTA. Blood is thicker then water, the ex-girlfriend is an idiot if she thinks what your son did would be enough to break a bond between a mother and a son. Especially a single mother at that.\n\nUnless she and her mum are friends of the family, you dont need to waste much more energy on this then what you already have.", "LMAO, NTA.  \n\nBut do block this girls number and on all social media.", "NTA\n\nYour son's ex is ridiculously petty, and absolutely audacious for even contacting you. I'm not saying that cheating is good, but it's certainly time for her to move on.", "I'm having trouble understanding. Your sons ex girlfriend wants you to cut ties with your only son because he cheated on her? LMAOO   \n\n\nYou're definitely NTA and it's crazy that she called out of the blue to tell you that you should.", "NTA \n\nYou are a not a bad mother. After that call, she is now a bad ex-girlfriend.", "NTA - You acknowledged and reprimanded your son for what he did. His ex has no say in what you both do, especially if in such an emotionally important occasion for you.\n\nUnfollow/block her everywhere and continue on with your life.", "NTA. It\u2019s been a year. You did what any good mother should do, and made him accountable. What he did was wrong, but theyre the assholes for even contacting you at this stage. \n\nLife goes on, and maybe she should move on. It\u2019s not your fault he cheated. He\u2019s a grow man who knows right from wrong \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA\n\nYour son is an AH for cheating but it seems like he dodged a bullet because the ex contacted you a YEAR later. He was stupid and cheated but that doesn't mean you disown someone.", "NTA - He's your son, he made a mistake and apologised. If they choose to accept it or not doesn't matter; he's allowed to get on with his life. The punishment is he lost a great girlfriend, not that they can keep harassing you both forever.\n\nWhy are you friends with these people on social media? Cut the ties and move on.", "NTA.\n\nYour son did something less than great.  You obviously weren't happy about it, but he's still your kid. They can want to cut ties with him, but they don't get to tell other people what to do and if every person who cheated (or did something morally similar in terms of hurting another person) was to be banned from family meals out, the restaurant industry would collapse.", "Good lord, these two people are ADULTS! Why are you and the ex-girlfriend's mother involved at all? \n\nI mean, certainly, tell your son you're disappointed in his behaviour and hope he's learned something, but to manage his post-cheating behaviour regarding apologies, etc., is ridiculous. \n\nHe's not a child who stole a toy; he's a man who can figure out his own business.\n\nYou're NTA for spending time with your adult son, but you're a bit of TA for being involved in the personal aspects of his life.", "No, but you really need to block them on SM if you haven't already. \n\nYour gem is not so shiny these days. She needs to stop peeking into his life. \n\nEven people who have committed crimes and been to jail have the right to move on in their lives hopefully with some humility and a resolve to do better, having paid a price.\n\nYour son abased himself before her and her mother twice. We hope he learned something. It's time to move on and she needs to also.\n\nNTA  As long as our kids are trying to grow,we should be there for them to be a sounding board for their dilemmas.", "Your NTA, he's your son. Of course you still have a relationship with him. His ex is off her rocker if she thinks you would completely disown him over what he did. Maybe if there were children involved or abuse... Yeah cheating sucks and he was wrong to do it, but it happened and their relationship is over now. The end. Lesson (hopefully) learned, and it won't happen again with new future gf. The ex needs to let you guys go now and move on with her life.", "In any breakup people around the couple tend to get silently allocated to one person or the other, regardless of reason. You cannot be allocated to your son\u2019s ex unless he did something truly unconscionable (the type of thing you go to jail for), so you\u2019re on team Son, not team Ex, by default. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for being in your son\u2019s life but you shouldn\u2019t be trying to keep contact with his ex or her family, and you shouldn\u2019t have interrupted their healing process by having your son contact them months later to apologise again. They deserve some space and to be able to forget your son in peace.", "No way an adult wrote this.", "NTA take her side over your son, she's an idiot if she thinks that going to happen.", "You shouldnt be this involved jn your sons relationships lol respect his privacy", "The ex is unhinged. Tell her to go fuck herself.", "NTA. It's unreasonable to expect you'd sever family ties with your son over that.", "NTA. What happened in their relationship has no business effecting your relationship with your son.", "Wait, why are the mothers so involved in the relationship of these two grown adults in their twenties?!", "ESH - all you parents need to remove yourself from your adult children\u2019s\u2019 relationships. This is between the two of you, not the FOUR of you.", "NTA - good for you for not involving yourself in your son's relationship,", "NTA. Your son was an AH to the girlfriend, but he's your son.\n\nWhat his ex did was completely out of line.", "ESH. The fact that you and this other mother even got involved to this level is bizarre. These are your children, sure, but they\u2019re adults. Not even like barely 18- full-on grown-ass adults. \n\nYour son is a man perfectly capable or making his own decisions, including how he deals with making a mistake. The fact that you gave him the silent treatment for a week over it, like a jilted lover is alarming. Sure, you can be disappointed in him, but, come on, he\u2019s not the first 20-something man to cheat on a girlfriend. It\u2019s a life lesson and an opportunity for him, as an adult, to deal with this on his own or to seek support from you as needed.\n\nTough talk- I think there\u2019s an inappropriate attachment between you and your son. It\u2019s perfectly understandable and normal that, after losing your partner, you are comforted by the piece of him present in your son. However, your son is a grown now, he will have his own relationships, make his own decisions and will likely do many things you won\u2019t agree with. You need to give him this part of his life to do so, and you need to try to move forward with your own. Make friends, pursue a hobby or interest, prioritize your individuality. There is a lot of support for people who are grieving and I won\u2019t sit here and pretend that it\u2019s easy, but it\u2019s important for you to start living for you again.", "YTA for for being enmeshed in his life. Organizing apologies? is he 5?\n\nButt out.", "NTA\n\nWhat your son did was terrible but the gf is completely out of line and crazy. Cheating is never acceptable but in the same vein you both are better off without the crazy ex-gf in your lives.", "Genuine question: \n\nLet\u2018s say this isn\u2018t a good reason to cut ties with your son, which at least I think it isn\u2018t.\n\nBut surely there is a point to cut ties with a human, whoever that human is or how it relates to oneself.\n\nWhere is that point? What does a human need to do to warrant a full cut off?\n\nBtw, NTA", "NTA for the dinner. Unfollow her.\nBut YTA for expecting her to forgive him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's terrible what Jason did but it's so entitled of the ex to expect you to cut off your son entirely. You made it clear you didn't support his actions.", "NTA, but I hope you\u2019ve raised a decent man.", "NTA, your son is a classless ass but it's not like he committed a serious crime on his GF's person, so asking you to literally cut all ties with him is totally unreasonable. It is (hopefully) in the past and not something he'll do again.", "NTA- if you were her mother and hanging out with the man who cheated on her and broke her heart, then yes, you would be. You are the ex\u2019s mother though, did she expect you to just call all ties with your flesh and blood because he had a mistake??", "NTA.  Your son\u2019s ex has a whole lot of audacity.   I\u2019d block her on everything and I wouldn\u2019t get that involved in another of his relationships.   The cheating should not have happened but that\u2019s your son!!  The ex has some serious issues.", "NTA. Block her. It\u2019s been a year she sounds sort of like she is unhinged. She shouldn\u2019t be looking at your social media or even caring. While your son made a mistake it sounds like he dodged a bullet. No mom should drop her son because he cheated on a GF!", "NTA. What is it with people thinking cheating makes you a less than human object worthy of shunning and abuse for life?? Yeah he shouldn't have cheated but the answer is for his gf to move on from him. It's insane that she'd think his own mother was going to disown him over this. Cheating means your significant other relationship might end. It does not mean you are never worthy of human connection ever again. I honestly would cut ties with his ex and stop getting involved in his dating relationship mistakes. He hurt her, she didn't want to forgive him as is her right, and the answer is to then have them both move on. It's absurd this is even an issue a year later.", "Oh wow. These two are a piece of work. You are his mother. You are not responsible for his actions. What do they want from you? To never be with your son again because he cheated? She needs to get real. Human beings suck. We do stupid things. We can be selfish. That doesn\u2019t mean our families need to stop loving us and being with us for mistakes. I\u2019d never expect my partners mommy and daddy to get involved in our relationship.", "NTA. He is your son. The bond between a mother and son is unconditional. Obviously, you don\u2019t condone his actions but cutting him off at all was extreme. Honestly, it sounds like he dodged a bullet with this woman however it happened. Unfriend the ex and her mother off social media and enjoy your son.", "NTA, why would she expect you to stop being a mother over this? Cheating isn't okay, but that doesn't mean you stop caring about your child?", "Did they expect you to break up with your son?", "NTA it's weird that they know what you're doing when they apparently wanted the son out of their lives", "I mean you\u2019re NTA for continuing to have a relationship with your son\u2026 but why the heck are you so involved in your adult son\u2019s relationships? \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to express to him that you are disappointed by him cheating, but the moms calling, the forced apology, the silent treatment for a week is all weird and inappropriate.", "Why are you forcing your 23 yo son to do anything? That\u2019s weird. And stop following those women on social media, you all need to get out of each other\u2019s business.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou don't have to always like your son to love him, that's why it's called \"unconditional\" love.", "NTA that's your kid. Youre supposed to have his back even after mistakes.", "NTA. Yes what your son did was pretty bad but you\u2019re his mom and you shouldn\u2019t cut him out of your life entirely for cheating in his early 20s.", "Good god lady. That\u2019s your son, of course you\u2019re NTA for spending time with him, you would be ta and a weirdo if you kept punishing him for something he did in a romantic relationship. That\u2019s not really even your business. You know who is TA? Crazy stalker ex girlfriend and her family who need to fuck off out of both your lives and social media. No one in this story has a healthy perspective on anything.", "Nta.  Geez.  We can support our children while not agreeing with their choices. \n\nMy 20 year old daughter cheated on her boyfriend. She called me crying because they broke up and she had to move back home.  We dropped everything and helped her move and she\u2019s been home for about a month now.  I don\u2019t like what she did but I still love and adore my daughter.  If anyone challenged me otherwise I would tell them to fuck off.", "NTA. He's your son. Everyone makes mistakes.", "NTA. That\u2019s your son. People make mistakes. You made him own up to his. You need to block the ex and her mom from your life.", "NTA - He is your son. Infidelity is between the two partners.\n\nThe fact that she wanted the mother to take her side against her own child is fucking insane. Block them both on Instagram.\n\nYour son comes first.", "NTA, but honestly with her attitude and her mother's attitude, I can kinda understand why he cheated on her. Not saying it was right for him to cheat (it never is the right thing to do), but maybe it was the only way for him to get out of a bad relationship. But you need to cut ties with your son's ex girlfriend. Unfollow and block her everywhere because she is going to be holding his cheating over both your heads for as long as she can contact you and try to control your relationship with your son.", "So you\u2019re  to disown your son because he did something stupid in his 20\u2019s? Honestly if his ex is so obsessive that she\u2019s calling you one year later after being cheated on and leaving him \u2026 she has some serious issues. Block her. Continue on. NTA", "nta man people are just so vindictive and cruel", "You know, I'm going to make an unpopular statement and say that if they're the type to contact you a **year later**, in spite of having no immediate ties to you, to screech about you needing to continue to punish your son for something he has actively tried to make amends for even if minorly. Than, they're probably a case of that, \"people cheat when they're abused\" scenario that always pops up in threads on the subject. After all, you don't get more clear of a bullet dodged than this.\n\nNTA", "NTA no matter how traumatic cheating is, it\u2019s completely unrealistic to ask a mother to cut ties with her son bc of it. this is something you ask of your friends not your ex\u2019s mom lol. plus you made it very clear you didn\u2019t approve of his actions.", "If the ex is still stalking him after a year that is completely unhinged. NTA but she's more of a turd than a gem.", "NTA. His relationships are not your business. Your relationships are not hers.", "NTA. You acknowledged what your son did was wrong. You told him so. You forced him to apologize more than once. You accepted his ex's decision not to forgive him. That's it. The relationship is over. It's been a fucking year. You have zero relationship with these people. What kind of an unhinged psychopath expects their cheater ex's mother to disown her own child over a transgression she had nothing to do with? That's fucking insane. Just block the girl. If this is the kind of person she is... well maybe the cheating isn't that hard to explain.", "NTA Trying to get past her mother calling. Your son may have not done the right thing by cheating. But I think he dodged a bullet. Block mother and daughter, no need to keep either in your life.", "NTA\n\n Unlike reddit's majority, i don't think that if someone cheats they should be punished for life and disowned by everyone. I mean, come on, that's ridiculous. I get that the partner would break up, but the rest of the world has no beef in this. Ultimately, he is your son while she is a stranger to you. Ofc in the end you'll always pick him over her, even if he cheated on her.", "NTA, he is family, he was an idiot, but he is still family. But I would suggest to find a friend for yourself to hang out. I know you are probably in your 40s like me and it's hard to get friends at that age, but you can't only have your kid as your friend.", "NTA. His ex is the AH. He\u2019s your son. Even if he made a mistake, he\u2019s your son, and you should be able to spend time together.", "NTA, he's your son. You can be disappointed but its doesn't change the fact he's your child.\n\n Now I can understand if it wasoonr of those situations where maybe he cheated with one of your other children's spouses but this is not it.  As you said he lost a nice girl and he's an idiot for doing it. People have to move on.", "NTA yes your son made a mistake and he hopefully regrets what he did. But a loving mother would not cut all contact with their child over this. Block the ex and her family, they are psychos", "Totally agree. A year has passed she didn\u2019t wanna accept the apology she should have moved on and healed by then. Is she so bitter that she doesn\u2019t want to let him go? The son learnt a lesson (hopefully) and is living life with his mother the most unbreakable bond in nature.", "This. This makes me wonder whether she really was a completely blameless party in their failed relationship, cheating or not. This is not a normal reaction to an ex who cheated on you a year ago.", "Thank you. I was struggling to say this.", "exactly", "No they are not friends of our family she was his collage mate.", "Not really related to the comment, but \"Blood is thicker than water\" originally the opposite of \"family first\". \"The blood of the covenent...\" meaning the bonds you intentionally form \"...is thicker than the water of the womb\" meaning your literal family.", "After time passed I didn\u2019t feel the need to block them, I was wrong.", "I was looking for this comment! Like, why there were four people in these relationships berween two adult people? (Might it be the son cheated because he wanted some relationships without moms in them? Wrong way to go about it, of course, cheating is never ok.)", "You are right I shouldn\u2019t have contacted them 2 months later we had good relationship with them so I wanted to clear the water. I regret it now.", "some people are esl bro", "I assume because she knew them when they were growing up. She said they met in college.", "Interestingly, I felt they were overly involved (insisting on apologies, etc.).  Different cultural standards, perhaps?", "You said this so well.  I was thinking this too.", "LOL! Then you\u2019ve wasted enough of your time. You\u2019re a good mum and woman. Some jilted ex-girlfriends words shouldn\u2019t bother you.", "Thats actually not true, \"blood is thicker than water\" came first as a standalone, from a fable that said \u201cI also hear it said that kin blood is not spoiled by water\", and was then used as a proverb. Its not clear where the longer version comes from, but it is seemingly just a rumour that this is the \"original\" expression. \n\n[Link](https://symbolismandmetaphor.com/blood-is-thicker-than-water-origins/)\n\n[Another link](https://auralcrave.com/en/2023/04/11/blood-is-thicker-than-water-the-full-quote-and-its-origin/#google_vignette)\n\nThe first link says the long version comes from misinterpreting these two different texts, the second one says it came from the military but it doesn't seem to have a source for that.", "Well you learn something new everyday. That\u2019s awkward believing the proverb around the wrong for 30+ years LOL!", "Just unfollow them and move on.", "I wasn\u2019t going to involve myself but her mother called me first so I felt like I had to do something", "Sorry but its actually not true see my other comment."]}
