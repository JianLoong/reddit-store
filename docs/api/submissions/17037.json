Yeah, your friend should be informed of her boyfriend's behavior, especially if she is a really close friend. But it was absurd to tell her to \"make him\" get out of your DM's when you had the power to block him. It was a situation of which she should have been informed but not dragged into (unless you were going the route of finding out what she thought so you could decide whether to cut her out of your life).\n\nI mean, this started with you making a statement that you meant to be defiant, right?

If you're going to do that, be prepared to block the assholes who come out of the woodwork to harass you.", "NTA good riddance", "NTA.

I used the logic that if my bf was being a dick to one of my closest friends, I\u2019d want to know.
