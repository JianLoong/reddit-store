It\u2019s absurd to expect her friend to control his behavior instead of just blocking him herself, bc even if her friend did try to tell him to stop there\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll listen.\n\nETA I typically don\u2019t post on social media about these kinds of things because I don\u2019t really see the point when the majority of my friends and followers already agree with me, but I have had a similar situation happen. I posted a criticism of the cops and had an acquaintance reply to the story trying to start an argument. At first I decided to engage with him on face value and answer his questions and fully explain my viewpoint, but it became very clear after a few exchanges that he was just parroting right wing bs and no amount of clear explanation or persuasion on my end was going to make a difference. You know what I did? I stopped responding, and that was the end of that. If he had continued to harrass me about it I would have blocked him. It\u2019s really not that hard to deal with assholes like that on social media unless they go the extra mile of creating new accounts or harassing you on other platforms, at which point it\u2019s legitimately harassment and you can get the authorities involved.\n\nSECOND EDIT: I just saw that OP updated her post and said this was a private account with a very small following, which is context that I think changes things. Saying \u201cunfollow if you disagree\u201d is something that I think is silly and does sort of invite assholes to argue with you on a public social media page. (I don\u2019t think this is \u201casking for it\u201d even in that case, because obviously harassment and bad faith argument is the fault of the person who is making the attack. I just personally don\u2019t post things like that because I expect from prior experience that if anyone is looking to try to get under my skin they\u2019ll use something like that as an excuse. That doesn\u2019t make their behavior okay.) However, on a private page where you expect that everyone who is following you is someone you can trust to a certain degree, I think asking folks who disagree with you on human rights to weed themselves out of that group makes a little bit more sense. \n\nI still think that OP needs to learn about the existence of the block button.

I\u2019m not justifying that it\u2019s ok for him to use the word, I don\u2019t think it is \u2026 but who the fuck knows what his understanding is of the complicated history of that word and it\u2019s usage, given that he\u2019s not from the US. Sounds like he needs to be educated, not shunned. \n\nAnd I know that OP said he \u201cdemanded\u201d an explanation for her opinion, but we have no fucking clue how he actually said it. It\u2019s possible he was actually trying to engage in a discussion to learn and understand more. I have no idea if this is how he approached it or not, all we have to go on is OP\u2019s description, which again, is why I said the guy seems like an asshole.", "Not necessarily safer, but I can understand why someone would hesitate to block.", "Then how is your diatribe relevant to this scenario, where someone overtly bigoted took offense to someone attempting to remove bigotry from their circle? If you get upset at someone saying \"I don't want to hang out with homophobes\" you have some soul searching to do.", "There\u2019s no way for white people to use the N-word without being dehumanizing. That you would openly defend it tells me all I need to know about you. You are nothing but another worthless bigot and you\u2019ll never be anything more.", ">I didn\u2019t want to get into a religious debate w him, so I texted my friend asking her to get him out of my DMs. \n\n?", "Um \u2026 no, the question is \u201cAm I the asshole\u201d. And yes, as I just explained above, I think OP and her friend\u2019s boyfriend are both the asshole for dragging her friend into this political drama that her friend clearly did not want to be a part of.", "I have too many friends & family, on both sides of the aisle who are aggressive about posting political shit online. Even my mom, who I love more than anything, and who I agree with politically on LITERALLY EVERYTHING, posts stuff that annoys me. In my opinion, she just takes it too far, and it makes me not want to follow her on social media. When I open social media I want to see how SHE\u2019S doing, as a person, as a human. I want to know what she did over the weekend, what music she\u2019s listening to these days, etc. I don\u2019t want to read the million articles she\u2019s posting from some media outlet that is inherently biased and then read her aggressive take on those issues. It alienates people. It makes me feel alienated, again, despite the fact that I agree with her! \n\nTL;DR - I get the sense that OP is the type of person who has made her political opinions her ENTIRE personality, and people like that rub me the wrong way. It doesn\u2019t matter which side of the aisle they\u2019re on, or if I think their political opinions are valuable / correct. It\u2019s just an annoying type of person to make that your whole fucking thing.\n\nAm I not allowed to feel this way?? \n\nI find the vast majority of the time when someone posts something like \u201cI support the LGBTQ community, and if you disagree you should unfollow me\u201d are just virtue signaling. It is likely not the only time OP has posted anything political / controversial. My \u201cdiatribe\u201d was literally just me seeing this scenario from her friend\u2019s perspective.", "How do you know OP\u2019s friend\u2019s boyfriend is white???? If he\u2019s from a Muslim country he is most likely not white. \n\nI\u2019m also not defending anyone (white or not) using the N word. Tell me where I defended that. I just said that assuming someone who does something wrong did so with malice is lazy. Plenty of people do wrong things because they don\u2019t know any better.", "So she texted her friend to get the boyfriend out of her DMs\u2026 after the boyfriend got in her DMs.\n\nTimeline:\n\n1) Boyfriend (third party) gets in OP\u2019s DMs\n2) OP texts friend to get boyfriend (third party) out of DMs\n\nThird party initiated.\n\nSo what is your point?", "Okay if you\u2019re going to be pedantic and argue that the question is \u201cAm I the asshole\u201d and not \u201cWho is the asshole\u201d, then why are you including the boyfriend as an asshole? Going by your version of the question, we can only judge OP and can\u2019t judge the boyfriend since he didn\u2019t make this thread.\n\nYou decided to be pedantic and then made an argument that only works if you go with my version of the question, not yours. Only my version allows for judgment of more than one person.\n\nYour comment makes no sense.", "I\u2019m genuinely just going by the standards of the subreddit \u2026 the typically responses are as follows:\n\nNTA (which means no OP, you are not the asshole here, somebody else is) \n\nYTA (which means yes OP, you are the asshole and the other people in this story did nothing wrong) \n\nESH (which usually means both OP and the person OP is referring to are the assholes) \n\nI said ESH, and you said you agreed with most of what I said BUT \u201cthe boyfriend is the problem\u201d. I\u2019m sorry if I sound pedantic, really, but my determination of ESH already included that. The whole last few back and forths have made no sense, lol, on your end as well.", "Um, no.\n\nI said the question is \u201cWho is the asshole?\u201d (This allows for zero, one, or multiple assholes)\n\nYou decided to argue the question is \u201cAm I the Asshole?\u201d (This allows for zero or one asshole, and that is only the OP)\n\nBut you also argued that boyfriend and OP are assholes.\n\nYour argument supports MY version of the question, NOT yours.", "NTA, but why didn't you block him?", "I'm going to agree with this as this was my takeaway:\n\nOP:  \"I live in a conservative place with negative views on certain groups.\"\n\nAlso OP:  shock face when someone expresses conservative and negative views about something they posted.\n\nBy all means block anyone you want but this situation is hardly surprising.", "My stepmother owns not a single thought or opinion of her own. Everything she says is a parrot of what my dad says. Now he isn't racist or homophobic so it didn't turn her into that but she could actually be those things but you'd never know because a conversation with them is like Dad: The sky is so blue today. Her: Oh yeah, it's so blue. So blue.\" My dad obviously thinks she is the greatest thing ever. I guess if that is what she had to do to steal and keep a man, she maximized the opportunity.", "Okay, but here is the thing, blocking someone while it is very easy, may also open it's own can of worms. \n\nI'm sure the friend would have responded similar once finding out that her friend blocked her BF. It may have started drama either way honestly. \n\nAnother scenario is the fact that it could make visits home awkward. \n\nLife is wild and things are seldom as simple as just a click of the button. \n\nCould the dialog have been better? Absolutely. However, at the end of the day chances are the OP probably wouldn't be in a position to socialize with the bf, had it not been for the bf dating their friend.", "Okay so... You're projecting? This is all just... Projection and guessing and making judgements based solely on your shitty relationships. Because what happened here was a guy who uses the n word and wants to debate about gay rights got mad somebody else didn't want that type of person checking in on her life. We don't even know the best friends opinions on this other than 'why was I dragged into it?'. As far as we know, OP was okay with people who didn't have her exact mindset because her friend literally didn't. They disagreed on stuff but still had each other. It was the boyfriend taking offense, not her. You're projecting your own biases. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Jesus you\u2019re desperate.", "I mean \u2026 yes I am using my own personal experiences and opinions to form a judgment about whether or not OP is an asshole. If you want to call that \u201cprojecting\u201d go for it. Everyone does this when answering in this subreddit or any other for that matter. \n\nWe can only answer AITA based on the information provided, so yeah some guesswork is involved too. That\u2019s not news, the first words of my original comment were \u201cESH - my guess is that you friend has conflicting political beliefs\u201d  and OP essentially confirmed that my guess was true with her reply, explaining that they don\u2019t talk about political stuff very often (I wonder why \ud83d\ude44) and that the last time they talked about it her friend was \u201copen minded, even if she disagreed in some aspects\u201d \n\nI\u2019m just reading through the lines here. And again, yes I\u2019m using my own experiences and opinions to inform my understanding of the situation, but everything OP said backs up my guesses as to what\u2019s happening here.\n\nEDIT - also I\u2019m not sure what \u201cshitty relationships\u201d you\u2019re referring to that you think I have. I have an amazing relationship with my mom. We talk on the phone almost every day. I love her more than anything, she\u2019s one of my best friends. I just don\u2019t like the way she acts on social media. Is that a crime?", "Desperate for what exactly? Lol your initial comment just makes no sense whatsoever. I\u2019ve clearly and articulately argued my side and all you\u2019ve done is try (and fail) to throw shade. \n\nPretty sure assuming someone\u2019s race without ANY substantiating information makes you the bigot, not me.", "NTA.", "Nta. Consider it a blessing, forget her as much as it stings and move on"]}
