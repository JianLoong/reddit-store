We were close enough for me to ask politely/as a joke; I didn\u2019t demand that she do it, I just wanted her to know what was going on. I used the logic that if my bf was being a dick to one of my closest friends, I\u2019d want to know. I assumed she\u2019d feel the same and take my side over his, but she didn\u2019t :/", "I didn\u2019t block him instantly because we had the kind of tentative friendship where everything was a joke.

Great and fantastic, welcome aboard being an ally publicly\n\nBut...\n\nYTA for roping your friend into a argument, she ain't his keeper though its pretty obv as to where her loyalties would lie right from the off. She may even agree with his position, in which case you're better off not knowing her anymore\n\nAnd...\n\nYTA for trolling Dick BF instead of blocking him, instead trying to argue/reason with him. That was NEVER going to go well....firstly he's a Dick and that was obvious, secondly he's a Dick with Religious Convictions and let's be honest, that's the worst combination of Dick. Remember ... there's no worst hate than religious love!", "All the people saying just block him, how exactly would that help?

He has independent views and opinions from you and your friend. \n\n Also why is someone wanting you to explain your views so offensive? I am sure it depends on how the question is asked.

THEN you go to your friend and demand an explanation of why she has someone this bad in her life.", "NTA- he was harassing you. If I was dating someone who was harassing a friend I would want to know and be so upset for my friend. \nYou gave her important information on what kind of person she is dating and she seems ok with it.\n        I won\u2019t be surprised if you find out he made her block you and he will probably find reasons for her to dump all her friends to isolate her so he can control her.", "NTA you asked her to get him to back off and she chose him instead of you. it's a friend you're better off without.\n\nI don't understand why you didn't just block him though.", "NTA.

(8 years is a long time for an 18 year old, it's shorter for a 40 y.o.) \n\nJust know that if you invite drama, drama will answer.

They all sound exhausting.", "Exactly this. The guy is clearly a MUCH bigger asshole, but you post a status like that because you want to get a reaction from homophobes. You can't then get all flustered and annoyed when you get a dm from a homophobe with the same energy. This is what we make fun of them for when they go out for \"liberal tears\" and end up the ones crying about how people are mean to them. Either deal with it yourself or block and move on. There was no need to start a fight then drag the friend into it.", "The simple thing to do was to have her views but not blast them on the internet. I believe that people who say things like \u201cI support XYZ unfollow me if you have a problem with it!!\u201d Are doing so to start conflict and argue with people who have differing views. \n\nTo add: this isn\u2019t about one particular topic.

My abusive ex was a racist homophobe too and I didn't say anything when he would go on his rants. My friends stopped hanging out with me because of it and then all I had was him. It was an isolation tactic.", "In your mind, how many times would a person have to use a hateful racist slur before it\u2019s okay to label them racist?

A message saying \"What are you doing with this guy?\" would have made sense. A message telling her to get him out of the OP's DMs (when the OP is perfectly capable of doing that herself) did not. I think it goes without saying that this friendship is probably a lost cause at this point,", "Yeah I understand they wouldn't have a right to get offended but human emotions are seldom so simple. \n\nThey were friends for years so they would know how each other would respond to a lot of situations. I'm sure OP thought she was doing the best thing she could at the time. \n\nThe screenshots would have probably been taken the same way as the original message by OPs friend, and then OP would have still been in the same spot they currently are in.", "I just feel bad for OP having to find out that a good friend will side with a racist homophobe over a longtime friendship. That sucks hard. Also I'm concerned for the friend as these kind of guys often are abusive misogynists.", "Oh, I agree with you. But the wording of \" control your BF\" irks, me as to why she thinks woman has to scoop up shit man is doing.", "Oh yeah, no I totally get that. I think OP probably meant that jokingly as one of their comments implied that and some people do have friendships that can joke like that. \n\nI definitely see what you mean though."]}
