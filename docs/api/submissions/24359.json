I like your style!", "NTA.  \nYou did your daughter a favour. He's 32, why's he hanging out with a 24 yo? Because he could abuse her like he did. \n\nYou're a good father.

She should see that as a red flag in her relationship, that he doesn't want her around for \"boys night\". \n\nWhy does she have to leave? She could go to a different room and not bother them, making her leave the house so they can party makes it sound more like the guy was or could have possibly been cheating. She dodged a bullet, be proud you saved her from possible abuse. Guys like that are closet DV abusers. It starts out small, and gradually gets worse as time goes on. \n\nThat also sounds very narcissistic of him.", "NTA. He kicked her out of her own home which isn't even hers. Other people's houses all the way down.\n\nBut yeah, you helped your daughter dodge a bullet there. Though you are taking it too far with requiring future permission.

Trying to control your very adult daughters' decisions through the financial power of owning the home is...gross. If her boyfriend were damaging your property, it would be your concern.  If she's deciding to spend time with her family while allowing her boyfriend privacy with his friends in their home...it wasn't your business. You were despotic, and I could see why this was a big red flag that caused him to break it off. Controlling parents are a big liability when searching for a partner.\n\nIt's also not your job to go over an adult woman's head and tell off her partner. She can take care of herself. Even if this guy were a bad decision, how on earth is she supposed to learn from mistakes and become an independent person capable of handling her own problems if you \"make excuses\" to covertly run off and handle her relationships? She gets to make judgement calls.", "Do they pay rent or is her bf living there for free? \n\nIf they don't pay rent then NTA.

Wonder what else he has done to her?", "ESH\n\nI don\u2019t understand these comments tbh. You should have spoken to your daughter first about why she shouldn\u2019t be disrespected like that and treated her like an adult. Going over her head, kicking her boyfriend out, justified or not is treating her like a child unable to make her own decisions. Then you went even further and told her she couldn\u2019t have anyone else live in the house without your permission?? She\u2019s 24 and you should have done a better job of raising her so that you could trust her to make appropriate decisions. The fact that you totally went over her head and are now threatening to also kick her out and sell the house shows why she put up with abusive and disrespectful behavior from a boyfriend. \n\nThe boyfriend also sucks for obvious reasons.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Thank God someone else sees how awful it is that this man thinks it is OK to make decisions like this without giving his daughter any personal agency. She is 24, not 14.   \n\n\nAnd people are actually telling him what a good job he did.", "> *boys' night vigilante*\n\nLove the phrasing.  Maybe OP could hire himself out to disgruntled wives and girlfriends.", "Do you not see how the ex bf making her leave for his \"boys night\" is a major red flag??? In any relationship, that screams red flag. Big. Red. Flag. \n\nShe could stay and go to another room instead. Why does she always have to leave? Why can't she join in even? Its not like she's hurting anything or anyone by being there or with them. The ex is shady af for not letting her stay. OP was within his rights as a father and a homeowner. Protecting your child from a possible abusive relationship goes a lot farther than letting him take advantage of her.", "No rent and didn\u2019t even help with groceries or utilities", "By example?", "The difference here is consent. The language used in the post is that she wasn't allowed in the house during boys' night. That doesn't sound like consent. That sounds like she was told to get out. NTA.", "8 years of difference is a big difference, there's a power imbalance. And he used it on his favour, kicking her out during boy's night. \nAnd there's young adults that are incapable of setting boundaries due to anxiety, being neurodivergent, or inexperience. And a 24 year old person lacks the experience a 32 year old person has. Don't try to justify anything. I bet you'd do the same to an unsuspecting young adult if you could.", "The boyfriend isn\u2019t even paying rent or utilities. It\u2019s not his home. This dad didn\u2019t like that a man wasn\u2019t treating his daughter right. To kick her out of a home that isn\u2019t his? She\u2019s lucky she had her dads home to go to. Her boyfriend been kicking her out of her house. Many shitty fathers would of just laughed and joked about how \u2018guys will be guys.\u2019 I find it sad that his daughter even allowed anyone to kick her out of her home and thought it was okay behavior. If she wanted a girls night and told her boyfriend go get lost would that have been okay?", "\"Making\" her leave sounds dramatic. Both my husband and I often consent to time apart with friends both in and out of the home. Unless Kate was stating some level of coercion or force was used to keep her out against her will, Dad is grossly overreacting to his daughters choice. Even if the guy is a dick... you let your kids learn from their own mistakes as long as they are safe. A 24 year old woman doesn't need Daddy to dictate what's best.\n\nIf she were posting complaining about the boyfriends behavior, it would be a very different story.", "\"Protecting your child from...\" Except that OP's daughter direct a full-grown adult who needs to be able to handle her own life and handle her own problems. If she had *asked* her parents for advice, or guidance, or help, that would have been one thing, but jumping in and *deciding for her* that something must be done \u2013 and sneaking off and doing it behind her back \u2013 is the very opposite of helping his child. You're all up in arms about Kate's bf being controlling and demanding, but *OP* is no less controlling and demanding. It's not hard to figure out what might have attracted Kate to her ex-bf: she went and found herself someone just like dear old dad.", "Good riddance. \n\nTime to have a serious talk about self respect and boundaries with your daughter.", "So the example you suggest she should follow is...

I hope she finds a way to think better of herself. She was being used and treated like trash, wow.", "ESH  \nThe bofriend kicking your daughter out - or did she prefer to spend time with you and your wife when they had boys nights? - I controlling your daughters living conditions, and removes her say in who lives there - BUT SO DID YOU!", "YTA. Your daughter is an adult and you're being super inappropriately controlling and possessive. If your daughter is unhappy with her partner having friends over, that's on her to deal with - not her father sneaking behind her back to chastise a bunch of adult men. If you let your daughter live there and move her boyfriend in, you need to respect that it's her space, and that she can make her own choices. You massively overstepped in your daughters life and relationships.\n\nYour daughter is an adult, and a full person, not another piece of your property to control and possess.
