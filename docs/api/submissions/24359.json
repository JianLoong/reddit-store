If she wants to make that kind of mistake she can fund it herself.", "Your daughter now knows that you will do for her. Once she is over that middle-aged moocher she has to realize her self worth is greater than she previously figured.", "I love you, you\u2019re my soulmate.", "Well, yeah... but I don't think that was his primary drive to do this.", "yes, they do. That's one reason they're so scary, they get insidious...", "I mean, it WAS his call to make because\u2026 it was his house\u2026? It\u2019s also his daughter\u2019s house, but it is definitely not his daughter\u2019s old ass boyfriend\u2019s house to host a gathering at??? Without his daughter??? Who hosts a \u2018boys night\u2019 in someone else\u2019s HOUSE. Wack.", "If you own the home, and never gave permission for the boyfriend to move in, it is absolutely your call to make. He may be allowing his daughter to live there, but that doesn't imply she could allow others to move on the premises without the express consent of the owner. Just like he could decide to sell the place and put them all out including his daughter. She is an adult and can certainly move into an apartment and live how she wants to (within confines of her lease agreement) there. But living in her father's place she has to follow her father's rules. As for 2nd hand info, who goes to their parents home, and sleeps on their couch by choice? When they live in the same area? Dude was kicking her out without anyplace to go so he could have boys nights with his A-hole friends. That is merciless and cruel, dude is damaged to think that is the way you treat someone, and the girl is too young to realize how messed up it is. She seems either very naive or someone that is used to being abused in relationships. Either way I hope she makes better choices in the future. \n\nNTA"]}
