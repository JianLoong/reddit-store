It\u2019s also his daughter\u2019s house, but it is definitely not his daughter\u2019s old ass boyfriend\u2019s house to host a gathering at??? Without his daughter??? Who hosts a \u2018boys night\u2019 in someone else\u2019s HOUSE. Wack.", "If you own the home, and never gave permission for the boyfriend to move in, it is absolutely your call to make. He may be allowing his daughter to live there, but that doesn't imply she could allow others to move on the premises without the express consent of the owner. Just like he could decide to sell the place and put them all out including his daughter. She is an adult and can certainly move into an apartment and live how she wants to (within confines of her lease agreement) there. But living in her father's place she has to follow her father's rules. As for 2nd hand info, who goes to their parents home, and sleeps on their couch by choice? When they live in the same area? Dude was kicking her out without anyplace to go so he could have boys nights with his A-hole friends. That is merciless and cruel, dude is damaged to think that is the way you treat someone, and the girl is too young to realize how messed up it is. She seems either very naive or someone that is used to being abused in relationships. Either way I hope she makes better choices in the future. \n\nNTA", "OP you did the right thing but your daughter won't realize that you are a good father until she is like 35", "You\u2019re not an asshole for calling out the bf, but you are an asshole for not talking to your daughter first. If YOU are trusting HER with the house, then YOU should go to HER when you have an issue with what she\u2019s allowing. It is HER responsibility to respond accordingly, and that way you treat her like an adult (which she is) by allowing her to take responsibility for her relationship and her housing. \n\nBy going to the bf, you interfered in her relationship and while he sounds like a dick and it\u2019s good they aren\u2019t together anymore, she\u2019ll resent you because of how it happened. You could\u2019ve preserved your relationship with her and possibly even her bf if you acted more maturely, like a grown up, and allowed your daughter to take initiative and responsibility in the situation. And if she isn\u2019t mature to do that, or if she\u2019s being taken advantage of, then you tell her the conditions you have in order for her to live in the housing you provide. \n\nBut unless this boyfriend is harming her or has done something alarming that requires you to step in, you should always consult your daughter first. Being a dad and being a man doesn\u2019t mean going and pissing on your territory when another guy you don\u2019t like gets you upset. Learn to communicate, maturely, and you wouldn\u2019t be an asshole at all in this situation", "NTA but this abrupt change may be difficult for your daughter as well as seeing another strong/confident individual telling her who can be in her home. It's a similar vibe from a different person, not her choice. She may need more than a brief chat about boundaries here! Coaching, mentoring, a womens group, counselling could all be offered where SHE chooses the route to go down.", "ESH except Katie. Look, the guy's an asshole but your daughter is an adult who needs to learn to handle problems on her own because one day you'll be dead. Did you even try talking to her before you took it on yourself to solve her problem? Now if she dates another asshole she's not going to tell you or her mom because you did overstep (even though you were right about the boyfriend).", "Nta. Ty for being a good dad.", "NTA. Finesse is for a situation that may be delicate. This is not a delicate situation. Your daughter. Your home. She'll thank you for it one day.", "If you didn't stand up for your daughter, no one would have. She certainly wasn't standing up for herself.\n\nAs someone who had been in a similar situation (was told to leave the place that I was paying rent on because a roommate wanted the house for herself and her boyfriend on weekends), I can assure you how unfair that is. It doesn't even feel like you live there under those conditions.\n\nAnd depending on the state, if these boy's nights involved illegal activity, you could have wound up with some serious liability on your hands. No, not worth it. Your daughter is going to dislike you for a time, so be it. \n\nI think she'll come around. Be it she has a roommate who doesn't kick her out. A different boyfriend who does treat her right. Or just that time as a single woman focusing on herself. I think she'll realize what you did for her.", "NTA ,", "NTA..  32 with a 24yr old on a control trip.  He deserved eviction and so much more..", "Nah, NTA. You were protecting her from a shitty guy taking advantage of her. Also, wth were they doing on \u201cboys night\u201d that required her to leave the house for an entire day and night? That\u2019s sus as hell.\n\nShe\u2019s heart broken now, but once she sees the forest through the trees, she\u2019ll thank you.", "NTA\n\nagree with you. It shouldn't have happened her being out of her own home.   But should have spoken to your daughter first.", "So, normally I would have considered that overstepping, but older boyfriend was living there rent free and not contributing to utilities, and picking and choosing when your daughter was actually able to be in the house? Yeah, you did her a favour. \n\nBut please do consult with your wife about how best to support your daughter in the aftermath so that she gradually realises that her boyfriend's behaviour was red-flag.", "Pretty sure the bf qas using her for him and the boys be ause as soon as he didn't have a place to hangout with the boys anymore she was dumped. NTA although I think you went to easy on them. But good on you! If your daughter can't see what a good thing you done then she is a lost cause.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you went out and ruined your daughter's relationship, while pretenfing to do something FOR HER? You were just stroking your own ego.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you like to hurt and dominatr your daughter.", "Nta. Awesome way to deal with that leech.", "Also weekly?!?!? That's a red flag as well", "NTA, awesome move dad!", "NTA, my dad would do the same for me, and I would do the same for my children if I had any!.", "Nta but I can\u2019t help but wonder how it came up between her and him. Was it \u201chey babe may I have guys night once a week here with you out of the house for a few hours?\u201d Or was it \u201con night x the guys are coming over, so you will be gone during that time.\u201d The first one sounds more cooperative and asking while the other sounds controlling. Either way though I don\u2019t disagree with you because it\u2019s your house and letting a bunch of guys you don\u2019t know come over for guys night just sounds like trouble.", "NTA", "AGREE WITH YOU.", "I think that talk would have been better before he stormed over and took matters into his own hands. How about teaching his daughter to stand up for herself rather than turning her into a pile of jelly ripe for manipulation by the first loser she encounters. She needs to be taught to recognise when she is being taken for a ride. Her father sneaking round behind her back is unhelpful.", "Age has nothing to do with being an asshole. So please stop being stupid. Don't know where you got the idea that the age gap qas the problem and everyone upvoting you needs some extra brain cells installed.", "RIGHT. 10/10", "Lack of finesse would have been walking in with a baseball bat to drive home his point. Instead of threatening dude's credit rating. \ud83e\udd23 Like a dude living in a free house is terrible worried about his 450 Credit Rating.", "Tell us how you would of handled it then? I think the dad went easy of them tbh.", "NTA. Every situation could be handled differently; hindsight works like that.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m wondering. Just how did it come about and how did she express the situation to her parents.", ">you for ruining her relationship\n\n\n\n\nIt needed to continue??", "Adults pay for their own living expenses.", "Unhelpful? He got rid of the horrible prick. Seems that he was extremely helpful.", "Tell me you're young/immature without telling me...\n\nEdit: spelling", "all things considered nope, but that is somthing the daughter should have done. but doormat vs abuser is ...", "Or old and looking to take advantage of a young person", "How is what you said even related to age gaps? You are the one who is  learly immature/ too young to understand. Let people be happy, you are the one with the age gap problem not the people happily in the relationship. No one asked for your insight on how people should be policed. Then ganging up o  them because you don't like it. Mind your own business.", "Yeah, I just hate calling people creeps..  but yes, I thought that, too.", "You're disgusting and weird.", "For what? xD letting people be happy in their relationships with out others judging them? xD you are the on that's weird.", "For justifying power imbalances and then trying to \"call me out\" when you're the one who started this ridiculous conversation. Now shoo, you make me sick.", "No one asked you to stand up for them so why are you so hurt by what other people do with their lives. And telling someone to shoo never works so I don't know why you bothered. It's the Internet, everyone is everywhere at all times and the only person that is making you sick is yourself xD", "OMG, SHUT UP. Scroll on if you don't like my comment, and stop exposing yourself as a creepy predator that's taking this too personal. And get a life while you're at it. EWWWWW. \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22", "Haha your the one who doesn't like my comments, so maybe you should scroll and get on with your life. But honestly you must have a pretty sad life if all you can do is insult and judge people that you disagree with you, you seem to be just projecting though honestly because you don't even know me, nice way to expose yourself though xD pretty sure my life is happier than yours xD"]}
