He doesn\u2019t exactly have the best track record generally so it\u2019s hard to believe him. He was also pretty horrible to my mum around the time of his leaving.

But she is an honest person whereas I am not convinced about my dad.", "your dad had many opportunities to repair and better the relationship with you, and if your mom is an important person in your life, then he did himself a disservice by damaging that relationship.   \nNow he wants to get married and he probably wants everything to be perfect, and to project an image of a good and decent parent/caregiver, without having really earned it. you're entirely within your rights not to feel right about that, and wanting to sat away from it.  \nThe relationship may be repaired in the future, i hope. but it sounsds like he has amends to make first and foremost. it also sounds like he's unlikely to walk that path, unfortunately.", "NTA\n\nBe loyal to your mom.

Cause if he has been good to you, then your mom's request to essentially alienate your dad on her behalf is really not cool. She needs therapy to address her history of abandonment because it sounds like it causes her to choose poor partners. Also her loyalty is her just being your mom. My point is, do not let adult problems impact your relationship with your dad if you have a good one. Set boundaries with him and his girlfriend that you don't mind spending time with them but your mom is never to be a topic of conversation and if they try to the visit is immediately over and then actually leave.

That is admirable, but does that extend to choosing to stay home with her instead of pursuing things like education or job opportunities? When does it stop? Is this a codependent relationship? Maybe not yet, but it has the potential to become so. You and your mother both need to be making your mental health a priority and learning coping strategies - your mother should want you to have a relationship with your father if that\u2019s what you want. She shouldn\u2019t be expecting you to choose.

Best not to assume you know the reasons why things went down.\n\nBeing polite and friendly to your dad's girlfriend is not being disloyal to your mum. This is not a war where everyone takes sides. Your dad's girlfriend is simply a woman who has brought happiness to your dad. A little bit of happiness in the world is actually a good thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If I\u2019m the mum here I\u2019ll probably not want any form of contact with these creatures.", "NTA.  Your Dad sounds terrible and you're under no obligation to meet his girlfriend.", "NTA. Da sounds like a dick.", "Your mom making you chose between her and Dad isn\u2019t great parenting to be honest. I get your mom is hurt but she should want you to have a good relationship with your Dad and that involves at least acknowledging his girlfriend. It sounds like you and mom might be enmeshed and she uses you more as a bestie then her daughter. There might be a reason why mom has a history of unsuccessful relationships.", "Calling a cancer patient a lazy cow is enough to refuse to meet her, IMO. I might tell your dad that if she apologizes to your mom that you would consider it. She will likely refuse, which tells you what kind of person she is. That's not someone you want in your life.", "This brings up so many triggers for me. Do not allow anyone to pressure you into anything. I don't blame your poor mom for the atrocious way he treated her. It's a very hurtful thing to witness. I do hope your mom gets well. Your father sounds like a real piece of work. Personally, I wouldn't see him. I wish you well.", "Imo even if it just her side of the story, it doesn't change the fact that he just left and had an affair, he abadoned both you and your mother. So his side doesn't even matter anymore.", "It's not about loyalty to mom, it's about basic human decency and who was the real parent here. Your mom stepped up. And that's that.

And I've seen too many cases on here where that's exactly what happens. At some point --- pretty soon as it's been 4 years --- your mom should be getting the therapy to stand on her own.\n\nI just get the feeling that your mom is going to expect to always come first in your life and that you're always going to put her first to the detriment of your romantic relationships.

If anyone called my mom a lazy cow, I certainty wouldn't want anything to do with them. \n\nThat said, the decision should be based on your own feelings, not what you mom wants. It sounds like part of the reason you don't want to meet her is because your mom doesn't want you to. As the child, it is not your job to protect her feelings. You are entitled to still want to build a relationship with your dad, and that may include building a relationship with his girlfriend as well. Doing so wouldn't be abandoning your mother. So while I think you are perfectly justified in not wanting to meet the gf, you shouldn't feel guilty if you ever change your mind.", "If someone called my Mom a lazy cow we would never ever be on speaking terms.

Your dad is (mumble-mumble-nasty) and doesn't deserve your attention, and his girlfriend isn't your concern.  What concerns me is your last long paragraph about your mom.  She's manipulating you.  What is \"very fragile,\" and why has she been abandoned by everyone except you?  That's all very concerning, including that you must be loyal according to her standards.  I think you and your mom both need some therapy individually.  Not jointly.  You're already questionably enmeshed.
