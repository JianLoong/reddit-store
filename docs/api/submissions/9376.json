Let\u2019s call her Amy (28F) for now.  \n\nMy wife ( 54F)  and I (56M) are very conservative in our dress and prefer traditional gender roles for ourselves.  Our daughter is in a relationship with another woman , Dee, who is quite nice.  We accept them and will happily attend the wedding.   It took some time for my wife and I to come to terms with her lifestyle, but we have grown and value Amy( and Dee as well)  in our life.  \n\nThe issue comes with the dress code.  They say NO DRESSES OR SKIRTS allowed.   Both brides will be in elegant pant suits. I suppose you could call both of them more masculine leaning.  My wife does not wear pants.  Never has, per our faith we believe it to be inappropriate. Amy can do as she pleases, we will not. \n\nMy wife and I spoke with Amy regarding the dress code for the wedding and to tell her that my wife would be wearing a dress. Amy said to wear the pant suit or not attend.  She stated that we frequently made her wear dresses as a child and teen despite knowing how opposed to them she was. She states we always claimed the dress code was the choice of the host and it was our job to wear what the host demanded.  Hence for every wedding, funeral, family reunion, etc. she was made to wear dresses as our daughter. Once she became of age she could choose her own manner of dress, but when she lived in OUR home she dressed according to the family faith and values.\n\nShe now states that since SHE is the host, she is setting the dress code for pants.  We can either obey the host and wear the proper clothing or not be allowed. My wife is absolutely livid.  I told my daughter this violates our belief and how we feel most comfortable.  I put forth that she now chooses to dress how she prefers, we should be able to dress as we prefer.   She stated the only way my wife can wear a dress is if I wear one too.  Which is absolutely ridiculous. We are all adults, you can not force adults to violate their beliefs to dress a certain way! \n\nAre we in the right that my wife should be allowed to wear a dress to this \u2018pants / slacks only\u2019 event?  Would we be wrong if she shows up in a dress anyways?", "created_utc": 1675779453, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10w2xbn/aita_forced_wedding_attire/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I strongly suggest that means you probably aren\u2019t as chill and accepting as you claim. \n\nInitially I was going to rule ESH because I\u2019m not big into things motivated by spite, but frankly, how long is a wedding? A couple of hours? Your wife can\u2019t suck up wearing pants for a couple of hours?

This is a battle that will gain you nothing and could cost you dearly. Support your kid. Don't miss out on the memory of her big day over something so trite.

You claim that your daughter is forcing you to be uncomfortable, but that\u2019s not the case. The dresscode is simply a prerequisite for attending the wedding. Of course, if you had been forced to attend the wedding AND forced to wear the clothing your daughter requests, we would indeed be talking about you doing something against your will.

Whether you choose that your beliefs with regarda to clothing are more important to you than attending your daughter\u2019s wedding, is then up to you.\nMaybe take a moment and sit back to think on why you feel that you and your wife are entitled to this special treatment?

Mainly your daughter and DIL who will have to spend the day,that is all about them and their love, explaining to guests how you and your wife are too stubborn to play along for a couple of hours, and they have to make excuses on your behalf?

Let\u2019s call her Amy (28F) for now.  \n\nMy wife ( 54F)  and I (56M) are very conservative in our dress and prefer traditional gender roles for ourselves.  Our daughter is in a relationship with another woman , Dee, who is quite nice.  We accept them and will happily attend the wedding.   It took some time for my wife and I to come to terms with her lifestyle, but we have grown and value Amy( and Dee as well)  in our life.  \n\nThe issue comes with the dress code.  They say NO DRESSES OR SKIRTS allowed.   Both brides will be in elegant pant suits. I suppose you could call both of them more masculine leaning.  My wife does not wear pants.  Never has, per our faith we believe it to be inappropriate. Amy can do as she pleases, we will not. \n\nMy wife and I spoke with Amy regarding the dress code for the wedding and to tell her that my wife would be wearing a dress. Amy said to wear the pant suit or not attend.  She stated that we frequently made her wear dresses as a child and teen despite knowing how opposed to them she was. She states we always claimed the dress code was the choice of the host and it was our job to wear what the host demanded.  Hence for every wedding, funeral, family reunion, etc. she was made to wear dresses as our daughter. Once she became of age she could choose her own manner of dress, but when she lived in OUR home she dressed according to the family faith and values.\n\nShe now states that since SHE is the host, she is setting the dress code for pants.  We can either obey the host and wear the proper clothing or not be allowed. My wife is absolutely livid.  I told my daughter this violates our belief and how we feel most comfortable.  I put forth that she now chooses to dress how she prefers, we should be able to dress as we prefer.   She stated the only way my wife can wear a dress is if I wear one too.  Which is absolutely ridiculous. We are all adults, you can not force adults to violate their beliefs to dress a certain way! \n\nAre we in the right that my wife should be allowed to wear a dress to this \u2018pants / slacks only\u2019 event?  Would we be wrong if she shows up in a dress anyways?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I could see that being dressy and lovely. \n\nThis is what that one Dugger daughter does when working at the fire house. Wears the uniform pants for safety but wraps a skirt on top.", "It doesn't sound like you understand or have attempted to make amends with your daughter for her childhood.

It's that simple.\n\nYTA if you ignore your daughter's request.", "My guy, this is a test. Which is your priority: your religious rules or your daughter? Ideally you wouldn't have to choose between them, but when your religion says her existence is wrong, she's justified in making you prove you'll put her first. With no context the dresscode would be unreasonable -- but you admit you forced her into dresses as a kid. If this is wrong, that was wrong too. \n\nIf you love her and want to stay in her life, your wife should wear the pants (or you wear the dress). This COULD be a beautiful opportunity to show you really do love and accept her.

The dress code your daughter is asking for is a about solidarity and a show of support to subvert the expectations placed on her her whole life and say \"in a world that forces women to wear dresses, I'm gonna be the one event in any of these people's lives that does the opposite because I've been told it's the hosts' rules my whole life so now they're going to come to an event I'M hosting and see how that feels!\" It's playful!  It's fun!  Extend empathy for your daughter, put yourself in the shoes she was forced to wear her whole life and wonder how you, a cis man, would have felt if YOU had been forced to wear a dress.
