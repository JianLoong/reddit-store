Let\u2019s call her Amy (28F) for now.  \n\nMy wife ( 54F)  and I (56M) are very conservative in our dress and prefer traditional gender roles for ourselves.  Our daughter is in a relationship with another woman , Dee, who is quite nice.  We accept them and will happily attend the wedding.   It took some time for my wife and I to come to terms with her lifestyle, but we have grown and value Amy( and Dee as well)  in our life.  \n\nThe issue comes with the dress code.  They say NO DRESSES OR SKIRTS allowed.   Both brides will be in elegant pant suits. I suppose you could call both of them more masculine leaning.  My wife does not wear pants.  Never has, per our faith we believe it to be inappropriate. Amy can do as she pleases, we will not. \n\nMy wife and I spoke with Amy regarding the dress code for the wedding and to tell her that my wife would be wearing a dress. Amy said to wear the pant suit or not attend.  She stated that we frequently made her wear dresses as a child and teen despite knowing how opposed to them she was. She states we always claimed the dress code was the choice of the host and it was our job to wear what the host demanded.  Hence for every wedding, funeral, family reunion, etc. she was made to wear dresses as our daughter. Once she became of age she could choose her own manner of dress, but when she lived in OUR home she dressed according to the family faith and values.\n\nShe now states that since SHE is the host, she is setting the dress code for pants.  We can either obey the host and wear the proper clothing or not be allowed. My wife is absolutely livid.  I told my daughter this violates our belief and how we feel most comfortable.  I put forth that she now chooses to dress how she prefers, we should be able to dress as we prefer.   She stated the only way my wife can wear a dress is if I wear one too.  Which is absolutely ridiculous. We are all adults, you can not force adults to violate their beliefs to dress a certain way! \n\nAre we in the right that my wife should be allowed to wear a dress to this \u2018pants / slacks only\u2019 event?  Would we be wrong if she shows up in a dress anyways?", "created_utc": 1675779453, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10w2xbn/aita_forced_wedding_attire/", "score": 1651, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I strongly suggest that means you probably aren\u2019t as chill and accepting as you claim. \n\nInitially I was going to rule E S H because I\u2019m not big into things motivated by spite, but frankly, how long is a wedding?

This is a battle that will gain you nothing and could cost you dearly. Support your kid. Don't miss out on the memory of her big day over something so trite.

You claim that your daughter is forcing you to be uncomfortable, but that\u2019s not the case. The dresscode is simply a prerequisite for attending the wedding. Of course, if you had been forced to attend the wedding AND forced to wear the clothing your daughter requests, we would indeed be talking about you doing something against your will. But, alas, this is not your situation. You have been invited to the wedding and can very simply choose to not go. Whether you choose that your beliefs with regarda to clothing are more important to you than attending your daughter\u2019s wedding, is then up to you.\nMaybe take a moment and sit back to think on why you feel that you and your wife are entitled to this special treatment? You claim you\u2019ll be uncomfortable if you don\u2019t get to assert yourselves. Have you considered the amount of people you\u2019d be making uncomfortable by showing up as you wish? Mainly your daughter and DIL who will have to spend the day,that is all about them and their love, explaining to guests how you and your wife are too stubborn to play along for a couple of hours, and they have to make excuses on your behalf? Get over yourself and your misplaced belief in the sanctity of clothing. Or don\u2019t, for that matter, and don\u2019t attend the wedding.

I would take a deep internal look at your own hypocrisy.\n\nEdit: I meant the daughter was forcing her parents as in enforcing an ultimatum, not like she had a gun to their heads.

Let\u2019s call her Amy (28F) for now.  \n\nMy wife ( 54F)  and I (56M) are very conservative in our dress and prefer traditional gender roles for ourselves.  Our daughter is in a relationship with another woman , Dee, who is quite nice.  We accept them and will happily attend the wedding.   It took some time for my wife and I to come to terms with her lifestyle, but we have grown and value Amy( and Dee as well)  in our life.  \n\nThe issue comes with the dress code.  They say NO DRESSES OR SKIRTS allowed.   Both brides will be in elegant pant suits. I suppose you could call both of them more masculine leaning.  My wife does not wear pants.  Never has, per our faith we believe it to be inappropriate. Amy can do as she pleases, we will not. \n\nMy wife and I spoke with Amy regarding the dress code for the wedding and to tell her that my wife would be wearing a dress. Amy said to wear the pant suit or not attend.  She stated that we frequently made her wear dresses as a child and teen despite knowing how opposed to them she was. She states we always claimed the dress code was the choice of the host and it was our job to wear what the host demanded.  Hence for every wedding, funeral, family reunion, etc. she was made to wear dresses as our daughter. Once she became of age she could choose her own manner of dress, but when she lived in OUR home she dressed according to the family faith and values.\n\nShe now states that since SHE is the host, she is setting the dress code for pants.  We can either obey the host and wear the proper clothing or not be allowed. My wife is absolutely livid.  I told my daughter this violates our belief and how we feel most comfortable.  I put forth that she now chooses to dress how she prefers, we should be able to dress as we prefer.   She stated the only way my wife can wear a dress is if I wear one too.  Which is absolutely ridiculous. We are all adults, you can not force adults to violate their beliefs to dress a certain way! \n\nAre we in the right that my wife should be allowed to wear a dress to this \u2018pants / slacks only\u2019 event?  Would we be wrong if she shows up in a dress anyways?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Wears the uniform pants for safety but wraps a skirt on top.", "It doesn't sound like you understand or have attempted to make amends with your daughter for her childhood.

Ideally you wouldn't have to choose between them, but when your religion says her existence is wrong, she's justified in making you prove you'll put her first. With no context the dresscode would be unreasonable -- but you admit you forced her into dresses as a kid. If this is wrong, that was wrong too. \n\nIf you love her and want to stay in her life, your wife should wear the pants (or you wear the dress). This COULD be a beautiful opportunity to show you really do love and accept her.

The dress code your daughter is asking for is a about solidarity and a show of support to subvert the expectations placed on her her whole life and say \"in a world that forces women to wear dresses, I'm gonna be the one event in any of these people's lives that does the opposite because I've been told it's the hosts' rules my whole life so now they're going to come to an event I'M hosting and see how that feels!\" It's playful!  It's fun!  Extend empathy for your daughter, put yourself in the shoes she was forced to wear her whole life and wonder how you, a cis man, would have felt if YOU had been forced to wear a dress.

The story isn't usually presented that way, though.", "I would give you a conditional YTA  \n\n\nSo, after reading the post, and reading some of your comments, there were a few things I would want to say.   \n\n\nI think you hit the nail on the head when you said in a comment:   \n\n\n>...we decided that our daughter, the human being, was more important to us and we would give an honest effort to being allowed into her life to participate as she saw fit\u2026. And exactly as she is.\n\nThat should be the attitude you should have as you approach this situation. I suspect that your strict adherence to your faith would have meant shutting your daughter out of your life. You decided not to do that. Does that make you less devout? Less worthy of God's love? No, it doesn't. Love is what God wants us to have and to share with each other, not hate. And you went with Love... That is the important part - not what your faith leader says, or the congregation, you went with what was in your heart, which was full of love.  \n\n\nHonouring a request out of Love is absolutely what God would want us to do. Your daughter is one of the people you love the most. The person whom made you reframe our own perspective. She is the person who empowered you to stand up against what your church tells you... and nothing bad happened.  She is a part of you. \n\nYes, she is taking something from her childhood and bringing it up again, painfully... but consider this an opportunity to show your progress, your love, and your commitment to her and her partner. And honestly, it will allow her to move past that sore memory in her life and become closer to you and your wife. \n\nIn the grand scheme of things, wearing a different garment for a few hours will not change how you will be seen by your God in the afterlife. Those garments are less about God and more about people maintaining control in your religion... but that is another discussion for another time.   \n\n\nI am unsure if you are Christian affiliated, but I have included two verses below about love.   \n\n\nFrom the Bible:   \n1 Corinthians 13:13 - \"And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.\" \n\nRomans 12:9-10 **- \"**Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves.\"\n\nYour daughter is a good person. Stick with her and honor her wishes. That is more important than not wearing *pants*.", "As you sow, so shall you reap.

I get that you are super religious, but there's nothing in the Bible that says how people, especially women are supposed to dress.
