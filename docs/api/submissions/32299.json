You are not obligated to do that. And the crib ask is hilarious. There are portable beds that she can purchase and send with a sitter that she may have. \n\nShe is incredibly entitled and seems very immature to be having a baby. You don't owe her anything. Her demands and controlling behavior will only get worse once the baby is born. She can be as controlling as she wants in her own house with her own baby on her own.

If you want pop and junk food that\u2019s up to you and she can just use some self control and not partake if she doesn\u2019t want it. And having baby stuff, car seat, crib, etc, in your home to babysit is your call not hers and when you babysit is up to you, she can\u2019t just dump her child on you when she feels like it.

Never heard anything like it. \nMaybe you can have a calm conversation about it and try to figure out where all this is coming from, where she got the idea that these demands are perfectly fine to make? It'll be hard but try to formulate the questions without placing blame or judgement cuz you won't get any answer then.\nMaybe, if she tries to explain, she'll realize that it's really absurd. Then you can continue from there.", "No kidding right!. But if the sister is being so ridiculous maybe hearing it from a medical expert will help because conversation obvi hasn\u2019t.", "Then your house, your rules. \n\nMy advice to you is not to have a bassinet and car seat available at your place:car either. She will take advantage of it by pressuring you or getting family to pressure you. \n\nShe\u2019s choosing to have this child not you. Just because you are going to be an auntie that does not mean taking on parental responsibilities. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA OP but please be firm with your boundaries.

I wondered if the junk food and fizzy drinks was because she has gestational diabetes along with her bizarre sense of entitlement.", "Nope, not just reducing her to her hormones. Said it was my hope that is the only reason she seemed to be crazy in her expectations. Maybe she is a narcissist regularly or maybe her body is just out of sorts because she is creating a new life.", "I feel like it\u2019s written by somebody far younger than op claims to be or OP and her sister do not talk much if at all and OP is leaving out a lot of detail", "Being pregnant with hormones does not mean someone is incapable of thinking rationally or keeping themselves in check. Yes, it's more difficult, but it is entirely manageable. So no, hormones are absolutely no excuse for someone to act this way.", "Yeah when I was pregnant I was so depressed for part of it only the fact that I was watched closely kept me alive. I never had that issue before pregnancy. A sister cried at literally everything the whole time. And then she'd get angry because she was crying over something stupid. Twice I saw her get angry enough that she was slamming stuff (it was laundry so there was no loud noise but she was folding it very aggressively)\n\nI'm not saying pregnancy makes all women crazy, but it does mess with some of us in an extreme way"]}
