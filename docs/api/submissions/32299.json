I didn't want to and never had to but my brother on the other hand would be straight in there doing it with no hesitation.

Then she resented me for not constantly checking in on her and proposed a session with her psychologist to help me better understand how I should interact with her because I wasn't meeting her needs.

Extra bases are good for a car that baby will be in a lot because there's always a risk of installation error and installing the seat every time Baby gets in the car increases the risk you will be in a hurry and make a mistake.

I get the feeling like the sister has some expectation to be able to stay in the house, which probably indicates it's a family home of some sort.
