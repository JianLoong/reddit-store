I didn't want to and never had to but my brother on the other hand would be straight in there doing it with no hesitation.

Then she resented me for not constantly checking in on her and proposed a session with her psychologist to help me better understand how I should interact with her because I wasn't meeting her needs.

And if she does, well, your whole family is pretty fucked up for letting her determine whom they invite to holidays, parties, etc. for almost 2 decades, and you're probably better off without them all (though that would be unfortunate).\n\nIf she tries to guilt-trip you or otherwise harangue you before giving up on her nonsense, either block her, ignore her, or tell her that you've already stated your position, and not to contact you again until she can behave like a grown up.  I would encourage some grace on your part, as she's probably scared as well as dealing with the emotional effects of pregnancy.  But that means you should be ready and willing to reconnect when she can be reasonable, not that you should indulge her bullshit and let her walk all over you before then.\n\nEdit. \nYou know, the junk food edict brings up another issue - why would that even be a problem?
