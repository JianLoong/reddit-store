I've gone out every other weekend since my wife gave birth. I'm gone roughly 3-4 hours, with a buddy of mine. She thinks that I should be home making dinner every single weekend because she cooks during the week, while taking care of the baby and the other kids (schools been shut down for 2 weeks due to water contamination). I work 4am-4pm. I'm home every night after work and every other weekend I stay home. She says she doesn't get breaks and she says \"I'm not even saying you can't go out but seriously, pull your head out of your fucking ass and cook dinner and take some slack off of me\". I do cook dinner- Fridays and Sundays- every week and the Saturdays on weekends I'm home. I think I deserve a Saturday. She deserves breaks too but is currently breastfeeding the baby, who won't take a bottle (we try nearly every other night). Therefore she will get breaks but right now we are at a difficult stage. Her friends of course think I'm a raging dick because when I don't work, they think I should stay home the entire time and cook and clean and take care of the kids. I'm only giving myself 1 day every two weeks but apparently this is not good enough. I shouldn't be having breaks because my wife isn't able to, in their eyes.

Life as you knew it is over. And unless you want to wind up living on a friend's couch, you need to step up and start helping your post partum wife with the household.

She doesn't get breaks, and not because she she's breastfeeding, but because you have 3 other children that she is also caring for while you're out taking your little breaks. She's doing it all and you're doing almost nothing, even when you are at home.\n\nWhat do you do for your family, aside from cook a couple days a week, when you're home? What are you doing to lessen the load of your wife? Two dinners a week isn't going to cut it, btw, that's just, sad, really. \n\nYou do not \"deserve a Saturday\", you deserve a swift kick in the ass, especially if you can't see that you're leaving your wife to do everything.  What she's asking for is a pittance compared to what you should be willing to do, without being prompted like a toddler. You shouldn't need someone to tell you this. You're a big boy now, with big boy responsibilities. \n\nI agree with her, get your head out of your ass.", "YTA. You and your wife should have equal rest time.

It's completely fine for you to get a break, but your wife should be getting a comparable break. Even with her breastfeeding the baby, you can take over everything else besides for breastfeedinf a couple hours every other weekend so she gets a similar break to you.", "YTA because you are not even discussing it with her. You are \"giving yourself\" time off as though it's only your decision. Treat her like an equal.", "YTA.

She thinks that I should be home making dinner every single weekend because she cooks during the week, while taking care of the baby and the other kids (schools been shut down for 2 weeks due to water contamination). I work 4am-4pm. I'm home every night after work and every other weekend I stay home. She says she doesn't get breaks and she says \"I'm not even saying you can't go out but seriously, pull your head out of your fucking ass and cook dinner and take some slack off of me\". I do cook dinner- Fridays and Sundays- every week and the Saturdays on weekends I'm home. I think I deserve a Saturday. She deserves breaks too but is currently breastfeeding the baby, who won't take a bottle (we try nearly every other night). Therefore she will get breaks but right now we are at a difficult stage. Her friends of course think I'm a raging dick because when I don't work, they think I should stay home the entire time and cook and clean and take care of the kids. I'm only giving myself 1 day every two weeks but apparently this is not good enough. I shouldn't be having breaks because my wife isn't able to, in their eyes.

I don't think you are the AH. You are the only one working right now. you are taking care of kids another man created and financing them or at the very least the house they live in, which is above and beyond most men. You already cook and clean on top of being the only provider ( at least for right now). 4 hours every two weeks is EXTREMELY REASONABLE. If those children are already school age that means regularly she only has to worry about the baby (Funnily enough the only one you are truly responsible for ) for 6-8 hours a day. The facts that the kids are home means they could DEFINITELY be doing chores around the house if they had the prior discipline and expectation installed in them, and its not to late to start that now. Laundry, sweeping, mopping the floor, doing the dishes. All she would have to do is tend the baby, feed the baby and cook. School age children can do every other cleaning chore and all she has to do is quality control and supervise. She is also a grown woman who already had 3 other children before this, She should know how to manage her time and set aside some time to get some rest relaxation or fun. If she doesn't pump already she should and her not think about it or planning how to do it is not an excuse, it needs to happen and its for her stress so its her responsibility to get done, you can offer advice and help but ultimately she needs to learn how to manage herself her other kids her time, her expectations and none of that has anything to do with you. And she has had 3 children before this, bottom line for her own sake she needs to teach and guide the baby to take the bottle with pre pumped milk, and delegate and teach her other kids who are more than capable how to clean up after themselves and help around the house. Unlike everybody else I wont disregard the fact that the kids you have chosen to help raise isn't an obligation but a VERY GENEROUS favor for her on your part. She is weaponizing incompetence while you work 12 hour days and pay for everything right now for kids that really are only her sole responsibility to raise and one of which you definitely are obligated to help with. She should know how to flesh out time to relax and chill, her kids live in that house and benefit from it and will one day live on there own so chores aren't just something practical for the household and EVERYBODY in now, but also life skills they need to develop for the future. You bust your but 12 hours a day. All she gotta do is involve the kids on the chores to help her own work load, focus on the baby, the kids eventually will be back in school  for 8 hours most days, and as far as cooking, if you made all the money that bought the food and spent 3/4s of the time you are expected to be awake to pay for it she should be cooking every meal, and the kids can help clean up after, Also why is she acting like she has to cook a different meal from scratch every single day, most families I know cook at max 3 days out the week making enough for leftovers for the other 4 days and then use the microwave EVERYBODY has in their kitchen. We have expected too little from women on the home front for a while now and now we have this argument to deal with. Some mothers don't even have the privilege of a man to take care of them while they are raising a child, you take care of all the needs and bills, for children that arent even yours and she is still expecting more from you, becuase she lacks the awareness to realize that is a gesture above and beyond what most men would do and she could be raising those three kids by herself doing everything she is doing right now with out someone else working 12 hours a day for her and helping with the house when they are home. If she doesn't get breaks because she needs to breast feed the baby its time for her to be her own best asset and teach that baby to feed off the bottle with prepumped milk and do what she needs to do to arrange time with friends to decompress like you took the initiative to. Any man that works 12 hours outside of the house should be doing MINIMAL chores when they get back especially if there are able bodied school age children who know what a mop broom and sponge are and how to use them, and a mother there to deligate all those tasks herself. Even when they go back to school and they free up her schedule they should have stuff to do when they come home, and build up those lifeskills for when they live on there own. At most you should empower her to realize she is in charge of the home and she has options to make things less stressful for herself and SHE needs to enact some type of initiative and explore those options.", "UNPOPULAR but NTA.
