I've gone out every other weekend since my wife gave birth. I'm gone roughly 3-4 hours, with a buddy of mine. She thinks that I should be home making dinner every single weekend because she cooks during the week, while taking care of the baby and the other kids (schools been shut down for 2 weeks due to water contamination). I work 4am-4pm. I'm home every night after work and every other weekend I stay home. She says she doesn't get breaks and she says \"I'm not even saying you can't go out but seriously, pull your head out of your fucking ass and cook dinner and take some slack off of me\". I do cook dinner- Fridays and Sundays- every week and the Saturdays on weekends I'm home. I think I deserve a Saturday. She deserves breaks too but is currently breastfeeding the baby, who won't take a bottle (we try nearly every other night). Therefore she will get breaks but right now we are at a difficult stage. Her friends of course think I'm a raging dick because when I don't work, they think I should stay home the entire time and cook and clean and take care of the kids. I'm only giving myself 1 day every two weeks but apparently this is not good enough. I shouldn't be having breaks because my wife isn't able to, in their eyes.

Life as you knew it is over. And unless you want to wind up living on a friend's couch, you need to step up and start helping your post partum wife with the household.

What are you doing to lessen the load of your wife? Two dinners a week isn't going to cut it, btw, that's just, sad, really. \n\nYou do not \"deserve a Saturday\", you deserve a swift kick in the ass, especially if you can't see that you're leaving your wife to do everything.  What she's asking for is a pittance compared to what you should be willing to do, without being prompted like a toddler. You shouldn't need someone to tell you this. You're a big boy now, with big boy responsibilities. \n\nI agree with her, get your head out of your ass.", "YTA. You and your wife should have equal rest time.

It's completely fine for you to get a break, but your wife should be getting a comparable break. Even with her breastfeeding the baby, you can take over everything else besides for breastfeedinf a couple hours every other weekend so she gets a similar break to you.", "YTA because you are not even discussing it with her. You are \"giving yourself\" time off as though it's only your decision. Treat her like an equal.", "YTA.

She thinks that I should be home making dinner every single weekend because she cooks during the week, while taking care of the baby and the other kids (schools been shut down for 2 weeks due to water contamination). I work 4am-4pm. I'm home every night after work and every other weekend I stay home. She says she doesn't get breaks and she says \"I'm not even saying you can't go out but seriously, pull your head out of your fucking ass and cook dinner and take some slack off of me\". I do cook dinner- Fridays and Sundays- every week and the Saturdays on weekends I'm home. I think I deserve a Saturday. She deserves breaks too but is currently breastfeeding the baby, who won't take a bottle (we try nearly every other night). Therefore she will get breaks but right now we are at a difficult stage. Her friends of course think I'm a raging dick because when I don't work, they think I should stay home the entire time and cook and clean and take care of the kids. I'm only giving myself 1 day every two weeks but apparently this is not good enough. I shouldn't be having breaks because my wife isn't able to, in their eyes.
