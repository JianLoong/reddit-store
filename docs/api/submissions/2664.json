And its actually traumatizing having your identity erased because it is \"easier\" for the adoptive parents. \n\nI'm going to be honest, your husband needs to spend some time healing his wounds and understanding how that would impact a child that he's adopting. He needs to learn how to separate out his trauma from an entire culture. \n\nIf your husband is not prepared to do that, then he might not be ready to be a parent.", "Are you sure it's a good idea to bring a child into your household right now given that your husband is still struggling with his own trauma?", "NTA A friend of mine was adopted from Mexico into a white household and community at the age of 8. Her family did nothing to help her stay connected to her heritage. It caused major identity issues and trauma, which led her down a not so great path for a while. She would openly lament how it pained her to no longer speak her language, that any family she still had in Mexico is forever lost because of the language and newly formed cultural barrier. Now at the age of 30, she does not have any real relationship with her adoptive parents as she holds them responsible for this trauma.\n\nErasing a child's identity, especially cultural is cruel to do. We've seen this through colonialism, even with the religious boarding schools that our indigenous american brothers and sisters were sent to up until the 80s - that didn't work out too well did it? This child will never look anything other than Mexican. And not being able to openly and freely express your culture, speak the language, eat the food, connect with others -  And as a Mexican myself I can't imagine how horribe that would feel. Also, for your husband to say that being bi-lingual is going to hurt him down the line? Stats prove that bilingualism helps the brain grow in crazy cool ways! I grew up in a spanish and english speaking household (mexican father, american mother). I'm now trilingual and my brother is cuadrilingual. We both have MBAs and international careers so...No problems there.\n\nYour husband has to go to therapy because his approach is going to cause major issues for this child down the line. Keep doing what you're doing which is learning spanish, and exploring the culture. At least you'll be doing what is right by your new kid. Watch some kids movies in Spanish (especially Coco!), cut out papel picado together, watch a Mariachi concert on youtube. Just keep doing what you're doing and don't back down. With you in this kid's corner, he'll be fine!", "YTA for starting the adoption process when you don't have this already figured out. You and your husband need to get on the same page and be a team.\n\nMy personal opinion would be that absolutely, kids should have a sense of their own culture. My basic level understanding of social work literature would say the same. But having parents who try to raise a kid with two antagonistic views of his home culture because they failed to communicate and because your husband isn't dealing with his trauma is going to be the larger issue for your son.", "NTA.

Everyone deserves a home that is not retraumatizing, including this child, your husband, and you. Best of luck.", "NTA - I think it would be more traumatizing to completely sever the kid from his culture, rather than have him in some familiar surroundings.

And it would be awesome if you could work on your Spanish too while kiddo works on English - teach each other!", "OP, first of all, congratulations on the adoption! I can tell that you care about your new son and he is lucky to have someone looking out for his best interests. It does sound like your husband is projecting, but I would tread carefully with overruling his wishes. It's important that you can come to a mutual agreement on what is best for the child in order to have an equal partnership as parents. If your husband feels you are undermining his wishes, it could just create further conflict, which may hurt your relationship with him as well as both of your relationships with your son. It might also be confusing for the child if you and your husband each have different expectations for him. I wonder if there is a way to suggest counseling for your husband, your son, or as a family as I think that may be helpful in working through past trauma and help set up your growing family for success.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nand sometimes context and know-how iareimportant; the argument that speaking multiple languages at home is confusing - it's nonsense and in fact its very useful to be able to speak several languages. When I was a child I spoke Dutch, English, French and German at home - it did not make me confused. In Europe many many many children are bilingual at least. My nieces speak Dutch, English and German fluently due to moving around and having parents of differing nationilites, my best friends child speak English, Dutch and Japanese aged 7! None of them are confused. I'd even go as far as to say being able to learn languages improves your educational chances; it improves memory, cognitive skills, more academic and work opportunities in the future the list goes on! \n\nI think this really does need resolving and perhaps your husband needs some professional help to deal with his traumatic past before it starts to impede, and perhaps are parents you need some counselling as this a big hurdle and once a child is in the mix you will face many more that you need to address as a couple so start working also on your communication, expectations\n\nI wish you all the best.", "NTA.\n\nCongratulations on adopting. You and your husband are going to be fabulous parents. \n\nYour husband can\u2019t outrun himself. I am sorry he experienced such devastating trauma from his family, but one thing EVERY parent must learn is how to break the cycle of abuse. Just because his parents were abusive, he can\u2019t use that abuse as an excuse to withhold your son\u2019s culture from him.

I think it will do him good finding a therapist that deals with those things or is also from a Mexican background.", "If he's not in therapy, then gently OP, I don't think he's in the right frame of mind to bring up a kid, especially one coming with cultural connections that are traumatizing for him.\n\nYou need to do what is right for this and any kiddo that enters into your home and that means making them feel safe if they need to use their primary language and remain connected to their culture.", "You should not be considering raising a child with this person. \n\nYWBTA if you brought a child into this relationship.", "Tough spot for you to be in. On the one hand it's fantastic that two loving people is willing to give this child a loving home. On the other hand your husband very specific trauma directly affect this child and could cause long term damage to him (maybe not). I'm torn on this.", "You and your husband didn't think fostering/ adopting a child with a Mexican background would bring up your husband or the child's Mexican background? That...I don't know what to say. \n\nAnd what on earth does having Jewish folks in the community (which you mention in A LOT of comments without need) have to do with this?", "Do you work with a couple's counselor? That might be a good avenue to explore since it's clearly linked to your husband's trauma.", "OP you really need to stop what you're doing and listen. Every minute and every day you keep this child in your home around your husband treating him this way is TRAUMATIZING this child. Telling him to stop speaking Spanish and to speak English is frankly disgusting. You are literally coddling your husband at the expense of a child who is ALREADY going through a hard time. Yeeesh YTA big time. If that was my husband he would be out. Hes 100% wrong and you need to make a serious decision asap not wait and find out and hope for bloody change.", ">hope he'll see that repeating his family's mistakes of saying we don't accept WHO YOU ARE in this house is shitty and traumatic whether it's your sexuality or your cultural identity.\n\nThank you so much for saying this! I think I'll show my husband this post.", "I hope your husband snaps out of it.", "You're not listening. Your husband's un treated trauma is damaging this child right now. Going to a Mexican pre -school will not prevent the damage that will be inflicted by having a fundamental part of you rejected by your father figure.\n\nYour husband is creating the same environment he grew up in, he is continuing the cycle of trauma and abuse. It's not ok.", "No it won't impede his English. My husband and i are from England but live in Germany and when the children were small we only spoke English with them at home except when we had friends round then obviously we spoke German, the reason being, we live in Germany so the children will automatically pick up the language. \nBoth children are fluent in both languages and you are right bilingual children do have an advantage.", "It will not and there are lots and statistics to back you up.", "I'm sorry, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions.", "It doesn't matter. He is harming the child. This placement has to stop.", "Honestly you need to be a little less optimistic and a lot more realistic. This is not an ideal placement. Obviously this is better than a lot of places he could end up but there are serious discussions you need to be having with your husband. \n\nHe needs to know that in the case he becomes overly toxic or outright neglectful you will do whatever is in the child\u2019s best interest over his. It\u2019s time to put your foot down, therapy is not an option it\u2019s a requirement.", "Take him to zona Rosa in Mexico city to show him how homophobic culture is regional and not related to Mexico", "It really is and it breaks my heart. I could go on and on about the ways I've also been estranged from my culture for slightly different reasons. After reading the other comments, I'll agree that, if your husband can't commit to change and therapy, this is not the right placement for that child.", "Sure, \u201cif.\u201d And it will likely take a lot of time. Honestly a non Mexican family could easily do a better job than your husband currently is.  You should not gamble with this child\u2019s life.  If you aren\u2019t the right fit, you aren\u2019t the right fit. Other families don\u2019t have anything to do with it.  I understand how hard it is but you must put this child\u2019s well being over your desire to have him.", "I think you\u2019ve clearly hit a nerve and regardless of what you decide (on language) I sort of feel it needs to be tackled (the trauma) sensibly.", "My son speaks and write perfectly in english because vid\u00e9o games were allowed only in english, and we did those together because i wanted to keep an eye on him. Minecraft is a great family game. Hubby is free not to talk in spanish, if it triggers him, as you should be free to learn and use it as you want. I tried to raise m'y son with this in mind - it's a poem from Khalil Gibran \nYour children are not your children.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They are the sons and daughters of Life\u2019s longing for itself.And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You may give them your love but not your thoughts,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For they have their own thoughts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You may house their bodies but not their souls,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.", "Sure is, I\u2019m fighting to learn it and my mom just dances through it which makes it even worse cause I knew she could have taught me or at least kept speaking to me in Spanish so I didn\u2019t forget", "I'm sure his parents intentions were good too.  To me, this is a come to Jesus moment. If he will not deal with his trauma he should not be raising a child.", "We've had many other successful foster placements that were brief. It's cruel to say but if this child was only a year or two longer and didn't speak any Spanish my husband would have raised him as if he was not Mexican. Although I still would have rather had otherwise our state does not have a big Mexican community, so the child would have been an outsider at school. I am making more of an effort now because the child has already shown a preference to Mexican culture and I think my husband can change.", "No but it's needed and will help us out a lot.", "That's my reasoning too. Currently if I don't put in an effort to expose him to anything Mexican outside of him he just won't naturally stumble upon it. He's currently the only Mexican kid in his class.", ">zona Rosa\n\nThat would be a great vacation but he won't agree to it. It's not Mexican culture is inherently bad, it's because the kid and my husband went through similiar trauma at the hand of their parents. Unfortunately Mexican culture now reminds him of his parents and he assumes Mexican culture will remind the child of his parents.", "That is a beautiful poem. Thank you for sharing. It should be the motto of any parent because there is no envisioning what they will be like, only doing your best and hoping they turn out well. \n\nI am learning Spanish but haven't had time for actual lessons and have been using duolingo.", "op its not appropriate for your husband to raise this child. your surety that your husband can change means nothing. he does not want therapy. he does not want to change. he is already putting his own bullshit onto a child who does not need it. again - *its inappropriate for your husband to be raising this child*", "NTA\nBut I don\u2019t think this is the best home for that particular child. \n\nNot because of you, but because of your husband.", "I can only imagine how difficult and lonely it is for your son to be removed from everything that is familiar to him and not even being able to speak his own language with anyone. I  think you are great for what you are doing and it's sad that your husband's trauma is stopping him from seeing that he in turn is traumatising an already traumatised child. I wish you all the best and hope that your husband can someday heal from all that his family has put him through. Sending love to you all.", "Is it bullshit or deeply rooted trauma?"]}
