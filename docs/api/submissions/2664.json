And its actually traumatizing having your identity erased because it is \"easier\" for the adoptive parents. \n\nI'm going to be honest, your husband needs to spend some time healing his wounds and understanding how that would impact a child that he's adopting. He needs to learn how to separate out his trauma from an entire culture. \n\nIf your husband is not prepared to do that, then he might not be ready to be a parent.", "Are you sure it's a good idea to bring a child into your household right now given that your husband is still struggling with his own trauma?", "NTA A friend of mine was adopted from Mexico into a white household and community at the age of 8. Her family did nothing to help her stay connected to her heritage. It caused major identity issues and trauma, which led her down a not so great path for a while. She would openly lament how it pained her to no longer speak her language, that any family she still had in Mexico is forever lost because of the language and newly formed cultural barrier. Now at the age of 30, she does not have any real relationship with her adoptive parents as she holds them responsible for this trauma.\n\nErasing a child's identity, especially cultural is cruel to do. We've seen this through colonialism, even with the religious boarding schools that our indigenous american brothers and sisters were sent to up until the 80s - that didn't work out too well did it? This child will never look anything other than Mexican. And not being able to openly and freely express your culture, speak the language, eat the food, connect with others -  And as a Mexican myself I can't imagine how horribe that would feel. Also, for your husband to say that being bi-lingual is going to hurt him down the line? Stats prove that bilingualism helps the brain grow in crazy cool ways! I grew up in a spanish and english speaking household (mexican father, american mother). I'm now trilingual and my brother is cuadrilingual. We both have MBAs and international careers so...No problems there.\n\nYour husband has to go to therapy because his approach is going to cause major issues for this child down the line. Keep doing what you're doing which is learning spanish, and exploring the culture. At least you'll be doing what is right by your new kid. Watch some kids movies in Spanish (especially Coco!), cut out papel picado together, watch a Mariachi concert on youtube. Just keep doing what you're doing and don't back down. With you in this kid's corner, he'll be fine!", "YTA for starting the adoption process when you don't have this already figured out. You and your husband need to get on the same page and be a team.\n\nMy personal opinion would be that absolutely, kids should have a sense of their own culture. My basic level understanding of social work literature would say the same. But having parents who try to raise a kid with two antagonistic views of his home culture because they failed to communicate and because your husband isn't dealing with his trauma is going to be the larger issue for your son.", "NTA.

Everyone deserves a home that is not retraumatizing, including this child, your husband, and you. Best of luck.", "NTA - I think it would be more traumatizing to completely sever the kid from his culture, rather than have him in some familiar surroundings.

And it would be awesome if you could work on your Spanish too while kiddo works on English - teach each other!", "OP, first of all, congratulations on the adoption! I can tell that you care about your new son and he is lucky to have someone looking out for his best interests. It does sound like your husband is projecting, but I would tread carefully with overruling his wishes. It's important that you can come to a mutual agreement on what is best for the child in order to have an equal partnership as parents. If your husband feels you are undermining his wishes, it could just create further conflict, which may hurt your relationship with him as well as both of your relationships with your son. It might also be confusing for the child if you and your husband each have different expectations for him. I wonder if there is a way to suggest counseling for your husband, your son, or as a family as I think that may be helpful in working through past trauma and help set up your growing family for success.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nand sometimes context and know-how iareimportant; the argument that speaking multiple languages at home is confusing - it's nonsense and in fact its very useful to be able to speak several languages. When I was a child I spoke Dutch, English, French and German at home - it did not make me confused. In Europe many many many children are bilingual at least. My nieces speak Dutch, English and German fluently due to moving around and having parents of differing nationilites, my best friends child speak English, Dutch and Japanese aged 7! None of them are confused. I'd even go as far as to say being able to learn languages improves your educational chances; it improves memory, cognitive skills, more academic and work opportunities in the future the list goes on! \n\nI think this really does need resolving and perhaps your husband needs some professional help to deal with his traumatic past before it starts to impede, and perhaps are parents you need some counselling as this a big hurdle and once a child is in the mix you will face many more that you need to address as a couple so start working also on your communication, expectations\n\nI wish you all the best.", "NTA.\n\nCongratulations on adopting. You and your husband are going to be fabulous parents. \n\nYour husband can\u2019t outrun himself. I am sorry he experienced such devastating trauma from his family, but one thing EVERY parent must learn is how to break the cycle of abuse. Just because his parents were abusive, he can\u2019t use that abuse as an excuse to withhold your son\u2019s culture from him.
