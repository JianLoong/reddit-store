It's *your name*. It's not about what your mum wants and it isn't about your parents' compromise either. It's about - and only about - your sense of personal identity and how you want to be known. Stand firm.", "NTA Your name, your choice. Quite frankly I also think your dad's choice in names is much better than your mom's. And the formality of a name really does absolutely nothing and people do not care. Your mom needs to stop obsessing and being so rude.", "NTA but your mom sure is. How terrible for her to tell you she hates your name, especially when you love it. After asking whether Grace might be a more professional name and seeing if you wanted to change it, and you refusing and letting her know your feelings, she should have kept her own feelings about it to herself. \n\nLet her know it makes her sad that you don\u2019t like your name, but you do like it, and anything more said on the subject will only keep hurting you and won\u2019t make you change your mind.

Her request is bizarre and not that it matters for the sake of the argument but Gracie is an amazing name, one of my favorites. Please tell her this is no longer up for discussion and you won\u2019t tolerate her criticizing your wonderful name. Her time to fight this was before you were born, and that ship had long sailed. It is never rude to insist someone stop harassing you.", "NTA. It's your name and you like it exactly as it is. That is all that matters. If she had objections, she should have said something at your birth to your father.", "NTA", "NTA. I feel your pain. My mom tried to come to me when I turned 18 to tell me I HAD to change my middle name to the one she picked out for me, which I didn't receive when I was born because my dad refused, as it would have made my name well over 30 characters long and was hyphenated. She said if I didn't she would sue, because as my mother she had fill rights over naming me. (she does not, she's just delusional and mentally ill)\n\nTell your mother you'll only change your name if she changes hers to something you pick. Then, use the same excuses she did as to why you won't change yours.", "NTA.  And she chose Beatrice?  Apologies to anyone with the name, but yikes.

Your name is pretty, OP.", "NTA - Moms can be overbearing and relentless at times, so it\u2019s important to stand up for yourself.  I also think your mom needs to grow up.", "NTA. It\u2019s your name, and it\u2019s weird to ask you to change it.\n\nI\u2019m really curious if she always planned on trying to convince you and your brother to change your names! I assume your youngest brother is too young to change his name, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see once he\u2019s 18!\n\nAlso, as another commenter said, you dad definitely picked better names!", "I had concluded NTA after reading only four words. The rest of your post only confirmed it. You're an adult. Your mom made an agreement with your dad that now she wants to go back on. Your name is not inappropriate. Your dad is still in the picture. Mom has had her opportunity to express her opinion. \n\nI like the suggestion by another commenter that you counter any more pressure by your mom by telling her that she should change her name. Additionally, what do your siblings who were named by your mom think of this situation? They could further the pressure on you mom to drop this subject by suggesting that they change their names.", "Tell \"Mom\" you hate the term \"Mom\" and that you'd prefer her to be called \"egg-donor\".

Ignore her. And good on your dad for supporting you.", "So NTA.", "NTA. Your mom is bitter she didn\u2019t have control over all the kids\u2019 names. She needs to chill.

If she disliked your name so much as she says she does, she should\u2019ve done something about it 19 years ago. Not now when you\u2019re an adult. And she\u2019s also barking at the wrong tree because she should be holding her grudge against your dad; not you. Not that she should be holding a grudge at all, because that ship sailed away a veeeery long time ago. Oh and also. Her name choices aren\u2019t really that good. Aside from Elizabeth, all of the names on her list are awful and I low key feel sorry for your brother Richard. Stand your ground and shut her down :) Gracie is a lovely name. It\u2019s not like your dad named you Apple or Honeyblossom or something like that..", "I mean primarily it is and it annoys me that she can't accept that I love my name. But I also think it's kind of crappy to try and go around her and dad's compromise too.", "So do I! I've often thought I was glad to be born second and mom won on my sister because I hate all the names mom would have chosen for me.", "It is and I love my name. That's why it's so frustrating to have her be like that.", "Thank you. I questioned whether I was or not because I was annoyed and figured maybe I was too harsh with mom. I love my name too!", "She did! She also had Martha, Agatha, Vivienne, Esther and Elizabeth all as girl name contenders. So I was always so glad I got lucky and had dad name me.", "This is the comment I was looking for! Sounds like dad had much more interesting ideas when it came to names! I like Nico too!!", "Thank you! I love my name.", "I feel like she did always think she could get us to change our names or that we'd naturally want more \"grown up names\" (which I think is ridiculous but anyway) with age and would be embarrassed by the cute names we have. If anything it worked the other way and my other two siblings don't like to use their full names.", "I think she hoped to change my mind (and my youngest brother's mind) down the road. She knew dad would not be okay with names he hated/disliked being used and then being told he couldn't use any that he liked. But if mom had a problem with following the agreement she should have found another way to compromise.", "I can totally understand. If I had your siblings name's I would hate them and probably just go by Bea or Rick or some sort of nickname", "My niece\u2019s middle name is Grace and we all call her Gracie so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Weird!

I would too!", "My sister is actually just Bea or Bizzy Bea to those of us super close to her. She'll always be Beatrice to my mom though.

You said in a comment the brother she named, Richard, goes by his middle name with everyone not at home but is afraid to go by anything but his first full name at home due to your mother's reaction.

When are you going to change it?\"", "NTA - Why is your mum so against the name Gracie?", "NTA.  Yes, you should care that she hates your name and harasses you because it is abusive behavior.

Tell her ma'am is more formal and appropriate for a woman her age.", "NTA your mother has a very weird fixation with the name. That\u2019s her issue.", "NTA. It\u2019s your name and she agreed to it.

NTA.\n\nINFO: Are your parents still married?", "NTA i think you and Nico got lucky with your names, its kinda bizarre she agreed to this compromise with your dad about alternating names and yet she refuses to accept, and its cruel and mean of her to show her hatred dor your name so loudly\n\nPerhaps she should start giving a damn that YOU like YOUR name and stop disrespecting you and your opinion on your name", "Right? Jesus I see many, many future posts about Mom in r/entitledparents", "Jumping on top comment with the standard naming advice I gave myself while picking my kids names. They might not keep the name forever and you need to respect when they tell you what their preference of name is. Sounds like mom was *really* hoping OP would be someone who rushes to change it and she is salty that dad picked a name OP finds fits her. Mom is the AH for continuing to bring it up.", "People in this post are being really shitty about other peoples\u2019 names. Pro-tip: Prefacing something with \u201cApologies, but\u201d doesn\u2019t make it inoffensive or OK to say. Beatrice is a lovely name, as is Gracie. Don\u2019t turn into OP\u2019s mother while seeking to condemn her (also shitty) actions.", "Your mom has some serious issues with boundaries and entitlement."]}
