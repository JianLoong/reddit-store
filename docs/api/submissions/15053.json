{"id": 15053, "submission_id": "12pqzwg", "title": "AITA for getting scholarship for my girlfriend's son and not my niece?", "selftext": "My boss gives out a scholarship every year for a high school senior who is a relative to an employee. It's very informal. Basically just have to tell my boss about the kid. If there's more than one kid's name put forward my boss will pick based on whose the best academically. Not many employees have relatives in high school though, so there's usually no competition. When I first learned about this perk years ago I told my brothers and sisters about it and that I could put their names forward. I just asked them to remind me. They both have a lot of kids and I find it hard to keep track of what grade they're in.\n\nMy girlfriends son (Eric) is a senior this year. He's planning to go to college next year, so I brought up my works scholarship to him. No other employees had any high school senior relatives, so my boss gave Eric the scholarship.\n\nNow my sister recently reminded me that her daughter (Camille) is graduating and to tell my boss. When I told her that Eric already got the scholarship for this year she was really angry. She believes I should have checked with her or our brother to make sure that none of their kids were graduating before I offered this to Eric. My brother agrees with this and thinks it's pretty shitty that Camille is the only one who's not going to get the money when all her other siblings and cousins got it and she was in their words \"promised\" this scholarship. \n\nFurthermore my sister pointed out that Camille is a better student academically than Eric. Also that Camille is actually family who I have know her whole life. Eric is not since me and his mom are not married and we don't live together. That's true, but only because she and I don't believe in marriage. We just don't live together right now because Eric's high school is too far away from my work. While I only  met Eric a little under 3 years ago I have a much better relationship with him than with Camille. I'm not his dad, but we do stuff together all the time. If I'm being honest had I known Camille was a senior I think I still would have leaned towards getting the scholarship for Eric. Even though he's not technically family he feels more important to me.", "created_utc": 1681754556, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pqzwg/aita_for_getting_scholarship_for_my_girlfriends/", "score": 376, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t think it sounds like you intentionally excluded your niece. NTA", "NTA... You advised your family to give you the heads up.  They did too late. It is a nice perk, but your sister shouldn't have counted on it.  What if you had lost your job?  The kid needed a college fund, and then any extra would have just made things easier.  The niece should be made aware it wasn't your fault.  Maybe she could try for the scholarship next year.  My son is 17, and I have had this college thing on my mind since before he was born.  I don't expect my siblings to take care of applying for scholarships for me/my son.  BTW if this makes them mad then you need to tell them off because it sounds like they should be very thankful that you were able to help the other kids.  Very ungrateful...", "Your sister should have reminded you earlier in the school that your niece is now a senior.", "NTA.  The deadline was coming up, and she knew it.  She could have reminded you sooner.  You aren't a mind reader, and you say you're not close.  For all you knew, she had a full ride scholarship and Mom would have been offended at the thought of her kid needing money.", "NTA.\n\n>When I first learned about this perk years ago I told my brothers and sisters about it and that I could put their names forward. I just asked them to remind me\n\nWhere does it say you \"promised\" anything? You told them about it and you asked them to remind you; no one reminded you so you gave it to Eric. Not your fault they didn\u2019t do the one thing you asked of them", "NTA, they aren't entitled to the scholarship. They should've made a better effort to remind if, especially since they seemed to be banking on it.", "It\u2019s one thing to be disappointed. But acting like an entitled ingrate is another thing. Eric makes sense. You\u2019re closer to him, and his finances are likely to impact yours, even if you and your girlfriend don\u2019t pull your money. Because a scholarship for him means she has to pay less toward his school, she will have more to save or spend. I wouldn\u2019t forward the names of any nieces and nephews if any remain until someone thinks you and apologizes. NTA", "NTA- how big of a scholarship is this?", "Your sister snoozed and lost out? No biggie to me. Bad timing on her part. NTA. (She should have reminded you at the beginning of this school year - not the end. I only say it because I have a boat load of nieces and nephews and I don't always have my finger on the pulse of what they are doing. I have kids of my own that get more attention and management.)", "Nta sis should have told you sooner. Sucks but is what it is. I got no scolerships to anywhere and life still goes on so sister should stop acting like her daughters life is ruined", "Am I the only one thinking that submitting any extended family you feel like is really taking advantage of OP\u2019s boss\u2019s generosity? Your siblings have too many kids for you to really keep track of but you\u2019re asking your boss to pay for their college? Honestly this whole family sounds very entitled.", "NTA  Your family sounds like they think this scholarship belongs to them. They can't expect that it will just wait for them until they decide to demand it. Did you or the company 'promise' her the money? Or was just your siblings making an assumption. Sounds like the latter. \n\nYou were kind to help so many of their children, and now you helped one of your own. If Camille is better scholastically, she can apply for other grants and scholarships as well. \n\nBTW, huge kudos and thanks to your company and boss for offering this.", "NTA you said to remind you they didn\u2019t and where too late. Good luck to Eric", "NTA. Since your boss said it was okay to nominate your gf's son. Your family waited until after the award date, so that's on them. \n\n*Changed due to new information that the boss said son of gf was also eligible.", "Are you able to get her the scholarship next year?", "NTA because of this.  \n\n>I just asked them to remind me. They both have a lot of kids and I find it hard to keep track of what grade they're in.\n\nBut this is still kinda shaky. I can see how Camille thought she could bank on the money.  I can see how her mom and dad may have thought that a few months before graduation is enough notice.\n\nBut I do think the responsibility is on them to follow through with you in a timely manner. \n\nWhat would you have done if two kids in the family graduate the same year? Would you have relied on who's stronger academically? Because if yes, and you were reminded of Camille in time, then it works out in her favor. Now if you chose not to submit her name in that situation, so that Eric wins, then Y T A.", "Hum NTA - you offered and they didn\u2019t remind you. It is not like reconstructed family isn\u2019t a thing. Or is it like - get in line, I was here first. \nInteresting concept which if anything show how they perceive your girlfriend and technically your step son.", "NTA. She should have told you. Am I wrong? I though that at this point in the school year..shouldn't seniors already be seeking out scholarships/financial aid for college?? IDK I graduated in 2003.", "NTA- if some else in your company put a family member up for the scholarship the same year she may not have got it anyways if her name was submitted. Therefore your siblings should not rely on this scholarship to pay for their children\u2019s education because it\u2019s not a guarantee. \n\nSecond, it\u2019s your work places scholarship. You\u2019re the employee. So it\u2019s ultimately your decision to put forward who you choose for the scholarship. If you\u2019re siblings want to take advantage of that, then they should apply for a job there and advocate for their own kids that you don\u2019t even have much of a relationship with.\n\nThird, in regards to your relationship with your nieces/nephews, it\u2019s awfully generous of you to put their names forward at all. By you stating that you didn\u2019t know she was graduating this year, I\u2019ll also assume you didn\u2019t get an invitation to her graduation. Mighty bold of them to feel entitled to the scholarship money when they don\u2019t care enough to invite you to important milestones events of the children that you\u2019re financially supporting.", "NTA, she shouldn\u2019t expect that scholarship from you, but I can see why she is upset. Overall, you are not the asshole", "NTA. It is YOUR job perk. Your job is not something for  your family to be entitled too.", "NTA if you're not close enough to her to know she's graduating, she isn't close enough to you to expect a scholarship from your boss.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Telling a family member about your child\u2019s graduation less than 2 months before and expecting a scholarship handout is ridiculous. Most scholarships have significantly earlier due dates for applications than that. If they were so concerned, they should have mentioned it last summer or fall at the latest.", "NTA", "Info : Eric is not your son. Isn\u2019t this scholarship for relatives? Or do they allow girlfriends\u2019 sons under a special clause ? Just curious to the conditions.", "Oh no, unpopular opinion coming up... YTA. I  think it was a pretty crappy thing to do, considering that's your niece that you've known all her life especially if you've put other nieces and nephews forward for it before... I hope she isn't  feeling bad about herself that her uncle remembered her siblings or cousins in previous years but forgot about her. Your boss is cool though!", "YTA. I call BS you don't know your nieces and nephews ages or atleast if they are in high-school. Your sister calling was her telling you your niece wanted the position,  just like you told them to tell you...\n\n\nEdit: Based on your comments you are definitely the Asshole. You gave the scholarship to all her older brothers and sisters and cousins yet not her. That's just so shitty to do.", "Yeah YTA here as you promised something to your family but didn't come through. Not knowing their grades etc just means your at best a mediocre uncle. \n\nEven if their reaction was poor, it's about your niece and your family.", "YTA. Seriously? Did you literally forget she exists?  Every other kid in your family got this money?  That\u2019s super shitty of you. \n\nShe must feel really special knowing she\u2019s not only the loser you forgot about, but also has to take take an extra 8k in loans at what, 8%,10% for private loans? \n\nAny chance she can get next year\u2019s scholarship given how loosey goosey it is?\n\nThis will ultimately cost her a small fortune.", "Yta, if this is a deliberate attempt to hurt your nuece, then good job I guess. Her kind uncle helps all her brothers and sisters get a scholarship, along with her cousins, but then just skips her and then presumably continues in the future to help her younger siblings and cousins. It's fine though, as he simply forgot she existed. \n\nAt least put some money aside for her therapy ffs, as there's no way this isn't leaving her with issues", "Kinda NTA because she didn't tell you soon enough but YTA for not knowing your own niece is graduating.", "[removed]", "NTA. You told them keep you informed. Sounds like they were a little late. Kind of hard for you to promise something you're not in charge of.

A simple call to your family before submission could have done the deal. You probably didn't give them a deadline. Just said to remind you, and they did.", "\"Promised\" the scholarship? That is not how things work.", "All the kids older than Camille have.

NTA. Your family can\u2019t expect that your boss is going to fund all of their kids education.. pretty sure on some years other employees will submit their own kids or relatives, so its not guaranteed. Your boss might also terminate the scheme or you might change your job. Your siblings should have prepared by saving up for their kid\u2019s college funds, apply for other scholarships or accept taking out the loan. \nAnd if you consider yourself Eric\u2019s stepdad or feel that he is important enough then he is your family member and it\u2019s not their place to ridicule that. If Camille would have hanged out with her uncle more, the uncle would\u2019ve known when she graduates. They have only themselves to blame.", "His boss is obviously in control and can choose not to pay out the scholarship or change the terms if he doesn\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t think the OP is lying and pretending he\u2019s got like 6 kids or something. \n\nYou sound the kind of person who gets mad at people for taking the vacation or sick leave because \u201coh no you\u2019re taking advantage of the business!\u201d", "So the kid who is for all intents and purposes his stepson should lose out?  What??", "I guess kind of, but also kind of not. By the time I came into his life Eric was old enough that he didn't need or want another parent. So I've never pushed into that roll.  That's said he is the closest thing I have to a kid of my own and I love him.", "Nope not on him. When I was applying for scholarship for school it was on me to do the reminding and submitting the paperwork. He told both his siblings they needed to remind him if they have someone graduating and they waited too long. They had no way of knowing other people would be submitted and he submitted someone who is like a son to him. He does not have to be close to his family. I am not close to mine for many reasons. This is all on the siblings for taking him for granted. Keep in mind he had saved them thousands over the years.", "Where did it say OP promised them anything? OP told them about, said he would forward their name if they reminded him. They reminded him way too late and the scholarship went to someone else", "That can go both ways lol. They could\u2019ve called OP like he asked but they chose to do it when it was too late", "Also what if there had been other kids' names put forward and one did better academically than the niece? Cue the sister pitching a fit even when her child was actively considered and rejected based on the same reason as other kids.", "I can barely even remember the details and obligations of my own life. It\u2019s almost a guarantee you will be disappointed by me, if you assume I will remember anything at all.", "You have already helped them immensely. What if he was actually your stepson?

Just because you are not married does not invalidate the relationship you have with Eric.", "The word \u201cusually\u201d means only that, not a guarantee.\n\nIf there were multiple names submitted by employees, your boss would have chosen one who deserved the scholarship the most. What would your sister have done in that case?\n\nAlso, if I wanted a scholarship for my kid, I\u2019d inform you the minute my daughter started her senior year or even in the summer vacations before start of the academic session. Your sister is lazy and entitled. NTA", "NTA, If you consider him close to your biological kid and you LOVE him- he deserves the scholarship! What if your biological child and niece graduated the same year?  Relationships matter... Family is not always DNA.", "And that's totally valid. A step parent role is a lot different than a standard parent role (I was a step parent so I get it) but you've still gotta put the kid first.

It only makes sense that as he's the closest thing you have to your own kid that he would benefit from your work scholarship.", "Except this kid. This kid won\u2019t get jack. She goes into debt.

At no point in the last two years did you never heard her discussing college visits, majors, senior pictures, graduation parties etc.? These things are mutually exclusive and the idea that it slipped you mind just doesn\u2019t jive.\n\nFurther, you know what you did. Per your own story, your boss would have picked the strong acedemic candidate, aka not Eric. So you ensured he wouldn\u2019t have competition so the lesser, he, though lesser deserving based on your bosses criteria, would win it.\n\nJust own it. Just say look, I\u2019ve been with Eric\u2019s mom throughout his high school career, and she\u2019s moving in together upon graduation. It felt right that he should get it this year.
