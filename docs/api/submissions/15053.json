{"id": 15053, "submission_id": "12pqzwg", "title": "AITA for getting scholarship for my girlfriend's son and not my niece?", "selftext": "My boss gives out a scholarship every year for a high school senior who is a relative to an employee. It's very informal. Basically just have to tell my boss about the kid. If there's more than one kid's name put forward my boss will pick based on whose the best academically. Not many employees have relatives in high school though, so there's usually no competition. When I first learned about this perk years ago I told my brothers and sisters about it and that I could put their names forward. I just asked them to remind me. They both have a lot of kids and I find it hard to keep track of what grade they're in.\n\nMy girlfriends son (Eric) is a senior this year. He's planning to go to college next year, so I brought up my works scholarship to him. No other employees had any high school senior relatives, so my boss gave Eric the scholarship.\n\nNow my sister recently reminded me that her daughter (Camille) is graduating and to tell my boss. When I told her that Eric already got the scholarship for this year she was really angry. She believes I should have checked with her or our brother to make sure that none of their kids were graduating before I offered this to Eric. My brother agrees with this and thinks it's pretty shitty that Camille is the only one who's not going to get the money when all her other siblings and cousins got it and she was in their words \"promised\" this scholarship. \n\nFurthermore my sister pointed out that Camille is a better student academically than Eric. Also that Camille is actually family who I have know her whole life. Eric is not since me and his mom are not married and we don't live together. That's true, but only because she and I don't believe in marriage. We just don't live together right now because Eric's high school is too far away from my work. While I only  met Eric a little under 3 years ago I have a much better relationship with him than with Camille. I'm not his dad, but we do stuff together all the time. If I'm being honest had I known Camille was a senior I think I still would have leaned towards getting the scholarship for Eric. Even though he's not technically family he feels more important to me.", "created_utc": 1681754556, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pqzwg/aita_for_getting_scholarship_for_my_girlfriends/", "score": 667, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is a nice perk, but your sister shouldn't have counted on it.  What if you had lost your job?  The kid needed a college fund, and then any extra would have just made things easier.  The niece should be made aware it wasn't your fault.  Maybe she could try for the scholarship next year.  My son is 17, and I have had this college thing on my mind since before he was born.  I don't expect my siblings to take care of applying for scholarships for me/my son.  BTW if this makes them mad then you need to tell them off because it sounds like they should be very thankful that you were able to help the other kids.  Very ungrateful...", "Your sister should have reminded you earlier in the school that your niece is now a senior.", "NTA.  The deadline was coming up, and she knew it.  She could have reminded you sooner.  You aren't a mind reader, and you say you're not close.  For all you knew, she had a full ride scholarship and Mom would have been offended at the thought of her kid needing money.", "NTA.\n\n>When I first learned about this perk years ago I told my brothers and sisters about it and that I could put their names forward. I just asked them to remind me\n\nWhere does it say you \"promised\" anything? You told them about it and you asked them to remind you; no one reminded you so you gave it to Eric. Not your fault they didn\u2019t do the one thing you asked of them", "NTA, they aren't entitled to the scholarship. They should've made a better effort to remind if, especially since they seemed to be banking on it.", "It\u2019s one thing to be disappointed. But acting like an entitled ingrate is another thing. Eric makes sense. You\u2019re closer to him, and his finances are likely to impact yours, even if you and your girlfriend don\u2019t pull your money. Because a scholarship for him means she has to pay less toward his school, she will have more to save or spend. I wouldn\u2019t forward the names of any nieces and nephews if any remain until someone thinks you and apologizes. NTA", "NTA- how big of a scholarship is this?", "Your sister snoozed and lost out? No biggie to me. Bad timing on her part. NTA. (She should have reminded you at the beginning of this school year - not the end.

I have kids of my own that get more attention and management.)", "Nta sis should have told you sooner. Sucks but is what it is. I got no scolerships to anywhere and life still goes on so sister should stop acting like her daughters life is ruined", "Am I the only one thinking that submitting any extended family you feel like is really taking advantage of OP\u2019s boss\u2019s generosity? Your siblings have too many kids for you to really keep track of but you\u2019re asking your boss to pay for their college? Honestly this whole family sounds very entitled.", "NTA  Your family sounds like they think this scholarship belongs to them. They can't expect that it will just wait for them until they decide to demand it. Did you or the company 'promise' her the money? Or was just your siblings making an assumption. Sounds like the latter. \n\nYou were kind to help so many of their children, and now you helped one of your own. If Camille is better scholastically, she can apply for other grants and scholarships as well. \n\nBTW, huge kudos and thanks to your company and boss for offering this.", "NTA you said to remind you they didn\u2019t and where too late. Good luck to Eric", "NTA. Since your boss said it was okay to nominate your gf's son. Your family waited until after the award date, so that's on them. \n\n*Changed due to new information that the boss said son of gf was also eligible.", "Are you able to get her the scholarship next year?", "NTA because of this.  \n\n>I just asked them to remind me. They both have a lot of kids and I find it hard to keep track of what grade they're in.\n\nBut this is still kinda shaky. I can see how Camille thought she could bank on the money.  I can see how her mom and dad may have thought that a few months before graduation is enough notice.\n\nBut I do think the responsibility is on them to follow through with you in a timely manner. \n\nWhat would you have done if two kids in the family graduate the same year? Would you have relied on who's stronger academically? Because if yes, and you were reminded of Camille in time, then it works out in her favor. Now if you chose not to submit her name in that situation, so that Eric wins, then Y T A.", "Hum NTA - you offered and they didn\u2019t remind you. It is not like reconstructed family isn\u2019t a thing. Or is it like - get in line, I was here first. \nInteresting concept which if anything show how they perceive your girlfriend and technically your step son.", "NTA. She should have told you. Am I wrong? I though that at this point in the school year..shouldn't seniors already be seeking out scholarships/financial aid for college?? IDK I graduated in 2003.", "NTA- if some else in your company put a family member up for the scholarship the same year she may not have got it anyways if her name was submitted. Therefore your siblings should not rely on this scholarship to pay for their children\u2019s education because it\u2019s not a guarantee. \n\nSecond, it\u2019s your work places scholarship. You\u2019re the employee. So it\u2019s ultimately your decision to put forward who you choose for the scholarship. If you\u2019re siblings want to take advantage of that, then they should apply for a job there and advocate for their own kids that you don\u2019t even have much of a relationship with.\n\nThird, in regards to your relationship with your nieces/nephews, it\u2019s awfully generous of you to put their names forward at all. By you stating that you didn\u2019t know she was graduating this year, I\u2019ll also assume you didn\u2019t get an invitation to her graduation. Mighty bold of them to feel entitled to the scholarship money when they don\u2019t care enough to invite you to important milestones events of the children that you\u2019re financially supporting.", "NTA, she shouldn\u2019t expect that scholarship from you, but I can see why she is upset. Overall, you are not the asshole", "NTA. It is YOUR job perk. Your job is not something for  your family to be entitled too.", "NTA if you're not close enough to her to know she's graduating, she isn't close enough to you to expect a scholarship from your boss.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Telling a family member about your child\u2019s graduation less than 2 months before and expecting a scholarship handout is ridiculous. Most scholarships have significantly earlier due dates for applications than that. If they were so concerned, they should have mentioned it last summer or fall at the latest.", "NTA", "Info : Eric is not your son. Isn\u2019t this scholarship for relatives? Or do they allow girlfriends\u2019 sons under a special clause ? Just curious to the conditions.", "Oh no, unpopular opinion coming up... YTA. I  think it was a pretty crappy thing to do, considering that's your niece that you've known all her life especially if you've put other nieces and nephews forward for it before... I hope she isn't  feeling bad about herself that her uncle remembered her siblings or cousins in previous years but forgot about her. Your boss is cool though!", "YTA. I call BS you don't know your nieces and nephews ages or atleast if they are in high-school. Your sister calling was her telling you your niece wanted the position,  just like you told them to tell you...\n\n\nEdit: Based on your comments you are definitely the Asshole. You gave the scholarship to all her older brothers and sisters and cousins yet not her. That's just so shitty to do.", "Yeah YTA here as you promised something to your family but didn't come through. Not knowing their grades etc just means your at best a mediocre uncle. \n\nEven if their reaction was poor, it's about your niece and your family.", "YTA. Seriously? Did you literally forget she exists?  Every other kid in your family got this money?  That\u2019s super shitty of you. \n\nShe must feel really special knowing she\u2019s not only the loser you forgot about, but also has to take take an extra 8k in loans at what, 8%,10% for private loans? \n\nAny chance she can get next year\u2019s scholarship given how loosey goosey it is?\n\nThis will ultimately cost her a small fortune.", "Yta, if this is a deliberate attempt to hurt your nuece, then good job I guess. Her kind uncle helps all her brothers and sisters get a scholarship, along with her cousins, but then just skips her and then presumably continues in the future to help her younger siblings and cousins. It's fine though, as he simply forgot she existed. \n\nAt least put some money aside for her therapy ffs, as there's no way this isn't leaving her with issues", "Kinda NTA because she didn't tell you soon enough but YTA for not knowing your own niece is graduating.", "[removed]", "NTA. You told them keep you informed. Sounds like they were a little late. Kind of hard for you to promise something you're not in charge of.

NTA. Your family can\u2019t expect that your boss is going to fund all of their kids education.. pretty sure on some years other employees will submit their own kids or relatives, so its not guaranteed. Your boss might also terminate the scheme or you might change your job. Your siblings should have prepared by saving up for their kid\u2019s college funds, apply for other scholarships or accept taking out the loan. \nAnd if you consider yourself Eric\u2019s stepdad or feel that he is important enough then he is your family member and it\u2019s not their place to ridicule that. If Camille would have hanged out with her uncle more, the uncle would\u2019ve known when she graduates. They have only themselves to blame.", "His boss is obviously in control and can choose not to pay out the scholarship or change the terms if he doesn\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t think the OP is lying and pretending he\u2019s got like 6 kids or something. \n\nYou sound the kind of person who gets mad at people for taking the vacation or sick leave because \u201coh no you\u2019re taking advantage of the business!\u201d", "So the kid who is for all intents and purposes his stepson should lose out?  What??", "I guess kind of, but also kind of not. By the time I came into his life Eric was old enough that he didn't need or want another parent. So I've never pushed into that roll.  That's said he is the closest thing I have to a kid of my own and I love him.", "Nope not on him. When I was applying for scholarship for school it was on me to do the reminding and submitting the paperwork. He told both his siblings they needed to remind him if they have someone graduating and they waited too long. They had no way of knowing other people would be submitted and he submitted someone who is like a son to him. He does not have to be close to his family. I am not close to mine for many reasons. This is all on the siblings for taking him for granted. Keep in mind he had saved them thousands over the years.", "Where did it say OP promised them anything? OP told them about, said he would forward their name if they reminded him. They reminded him way too late and the scholarship went to someone else", "That can go both ways lol. They could\u2019ve called OP like he asked but they chose to do it when it was too late", "Also what if there had been other kids' names put forward and one did better academically than the niece? Cue the sister pitching a fit even when her child was actively considered and rejected based on the same reason as other kids.", "I can barely even remember the details and obligations of my own life. It\u2019s almost a guarantee you will be disappointed by me, if you assume I will remember anything at all.", "You have already helped them immensely. What if he was actually your stepson?

What would your sister have done in that case?\n\nAlso, if I wanted a scholarship for my kid, I\u2019d inform you the minute my daughter started her senior year or even in the summer vacations before start of the academic session. Your sister is lazy and entitled. NTA", "NTA, If you consider him close to your biological kid and you LOVE him- he deserves the scholarship! What if your biological child and niece graduated the same year?  Relationships matter... Family is not always DNA.", "And that's totally valid. A step parent role is a lot different than a standard parent role (I was a step parent so I get it) but you've still gotta put the kid first.

These things are mutually exclusive and the idea that it slipped you mind just doesn\u2019t jive.\n\nFurther, you know what you did. Per your own story, your boss would have picked the strong acedemic candidate, aka not Eric. So you ensured he wouldn\u2019t have competition so the lesser, he, though lesser deserving based on your bosses criteria, would win it.\n\nJust own it. Just say look, I\u2019ve been with Eric\u2019s mom throughout his high school career, and she\u2019s moving in together upon graduation. It felt right that he should get it this year.

(That might just be me though) I wanted to say e-s-h but Camille however OPs technically not wrong here.", "I'd have likely put a girlfriend's kid up for the scholarship as well, dependent on the length and type of relationship with the kid and mother \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "I mean sounds like your boss already gave you the money for Eric/formally made the award official. So it sounds like they missed the deadline?\n\nBut it also sounds like if your sister has reminded you in time, you never would have even pit your niece\u2019s name in the pot to ensure your stepson got the award. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for your sister to diminish your relationship to your current girlfriend who sounds like your long-term partner. And the things she said are pretty mean when she\u2019s describing Eric and relationship to him.\n\nScholarships are not guaranteed. Some ting your sister would do well to remember. But also sounds like you\u2019d be willing to rig it for your stepson by refusing to submit your niece\u2019s name all together from your last paragraph \n\nKind of sucks overall because both kids are related to you in some way and should equally have been given a chance to stand on their own merit, not who you liked better\u2014something that it really sounds like you wouldn\u2019t even do to begin with \n\nESH", "YTA for not knowing that your niece was graduating and not putting her name in.", "NTA.   But why did you tell her Eric got the scholarship?    You should have just said , oh sorry!  You\u2019re too late!  They already awarded it to someone.", "I think your mistake was in telling them that it was Eric you put in. So much simpler to tell them that the boss already chose someone because they didn't tell you sooner.\n\nAnd what are they going to do in future years if <gasp> other people have children graduating in the same year as they do? What if it turns out that some other kid is smarter than theirs? What if <clutch my pearls> your boss decides your family has gotten the scholarship so many times that he's gonna give it to Joe's kid even though his biggest academic achievement was coloring inside the lines?\n\nYour siblings (and niblings) need to be a little less sure about this money.", "NTA. You asked them to let you know and they didn\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t matter who got it. It\u2019s not your responsibility to remind your siblings they need to ask.", "NTA\n\nSounds like Camille didn\u2019t apply for the scholarship she wanted", "Shoulda just said you would talk to your boss, and then tell your siblings your boss chose someone else.", "NTA. \n\nYour family has put you in a situation that you don\u2019t deserve. They are acting entitled for being related to you. You did exactly what you said you do. For your nibbling\u2019s & your girlfriends children. \n\nYou\u2019d siblings are acting entitled. \n\nThe decision is not even up to you.", "NTA: If the parents had done this correctly they would have measured their expectations rather than rely on them. It sounds like they\u2019ve basically told the children they are guaranteed $8k and leading up the whole thing will have made sure to factor that in. The niece probably thought it was a given based off her parents. They should have always made it clear it wasn\u2019t a definite and prepared accordingly. Any upset of hers lies firmly on the parents poor management of it. \n\nIf they don\u2019t calm down and apologise, based off your lack of relationship, and their reaction I wouldn\u2019t support them anymore. If it\u2019s even three previous children, you\u2019ve helped them with $24k. Let one of the local high school children get it, they will probably be actually grateful. \n\nI would defend Eric to them though. The whole blood thing is a pretty low and standard family manipulation. They obviously don\u2019t respect your partner or your relationship with her son. I\u2019d tell them they might be related to you, but he is your family.", "NTA. I think it is entitled that they feel that Camille was \"promised\" the scholarship. There are other scholarships out there.", "HA\n\nNTA.\n\nYour siblings are entitled and ungrateful.", "Well you remind them to tell when the kid is going to college but she didn't do this... She knew that her daughter was finishing high school but she wait until the very end to talk about this? Her problem..\n\nNTA", "OP mentions in the comments that all the other kids before Camille were benefited. They should be grateful for the huge favor OP did to them for the older kids.", "OP didn't give out the scholarship to the other kids though. It was based on a lottery system and they got picked by 1. not having a ton of competitors that year, 2. having the highest GPA of all the applicants that year and 3. applying for it before the deadline. You also forget that this kid is the closest thing OP has to his own kid and he does love and value him. While it sucks that Camille doesn't get the scholarship her siblings and cousins got, there are other scholarships out there.", "The last time I saw her was probably around 5 years ago when I last visited. I don't live near them, so I don't hear much about these things.\n\nI wasn't trying to make an excuse though as I admitted in the end of my post I still would have chosen Eric given our relationship.", "It is not his job to take care of their kids. That includes reminding them about this stuff. Also if they don\u2019t live close and they truly have that many kids? He\u2019s got his own life, it doesn\u2019t revolve around his niblings school schedule. He\u2019s literally giving them free money and all they have to do is remind him before the deadline. They didn\u2019t. This is on them. And shame on you for making this his fault.", "OP says it was $8K", "You know for most things in life (free or not) you are under an obligation to meet the minimum requirements. In this case it was calling to remind him. That\u2019s on her parents. \nFor instance, I don\u2019t ever just show up at the doctors office on a busy day and DEMAND they see me bc I called them when I was parking to let them know I\u2019d be there, or trying to move into an apartment without signing any paperwork and just expecting they\u2019ll leave the keys by the door, etc)", "That sounds like their parents' problem, not OP's.", "Lol so the PARENTS GETTING FREE MONEY shouldn\u2019t even have to keep track of one date and make one phone call for it? He\u2019s not their nanny or personal assistant\u2026 if they want the scholarship, the least they can do is remind him before graduation.", "out of sight out of mind", "I think my boss maybe would have made an exception if there wasn't another coworkers relative graduating next year, but I found out there is.", "Lmao that\u2019s her parents problem. They knew that they had to remind him before a certain date and they didn\u2019t. If anyone needs to pay for therapy it\u2019s her parents who literally failed her.", "He hasn\u2019t seen his niece in 5 years", "Why lie? He hasn\u2019t done anything wrong and trying to cover it up makes it seem like he has and was attempting to be underhand.", "to be fair though op did seem to have made that promise.:", "Yup. They should put all the money OP saved them towards Camilles tuition. Problem solved.\n\nNTA she should have reminded OP atleast twice. Once at the start of the school year and once when scholarship applications usually start getting accepted.", "There is zero evidence to suggest it was after the deadline.", "How do we know April wasn\u2019t normally early enough?", "Not everyone worships their niblings. I have 11 of them and couldn't tell you any of their birthdays.", "No, OP only said that they would put the names in for consideration,  if reminded.", "omg. I luv you! Move over, I'll join you.", "And what if it was one of the other employees kids who got the scholarship instead, are we still gonna hate on OP, or are we going to see how entitled OP\u2019s siblings are for foolishly \u201cpromising\u201d their kids scholarships that aren\u2019t guaranteed to be theirs. He hasn\u2019t even seen his niece in 5 years since they live far apart, and I doubt his siblings have made effort on their ends to meet given how they acted to finding out this news.", "That would be different, out of OP\u2019s control. \n\nAnd as he never had any intention of submitting her name, he could have at least given her a heads up so she could have had a few years to pick up a second job. She doesn\u2019t have enough time to make up that kind of cash.", "Yeah he could have, but he didn\u2019t know she was graduating this year.", "No, he clearly said in the comments he was never going to submit her name over the gf\u2019s kid.\n\nI really hope the the extended family can scrap up some cash for the kid.", "They should be able to. Maybe from the over $24k they have saved he has already aided in getting towards their children\u2019s education. He doesn\u2019t even have a relationship with them. They literally contact him to collect their money. He\u2019s chosen to help someone akin to his son. He can\u2019t help if the parents are leeches who chose to expect free cash every year rather than be actual adult parents and prepare in case it didn\u2019t work out and measure their kids expectations. It was never a guarantee.", "The fact that your sister even has to ask you to \"check\" if any of their kids are graduating is pretty telling.  For any kids I happen to approach while visiting with their parents, my standard small talk is typically what grade they're in, and if they're in high school, asking about post-HS plans.  \n\nThe fact that you didn't even remember your niece is a senior despite sharing the same grade as your gf's kid speaks volumes about the relationship you guys share.\n\nOf course you'd want to provide for what is essentially your step son. Good on you", "ESH. You told your siblings to remind you when their children were seniors, but your sister apparently advised you too late about your niece. However, you created the expectation with your family that you would always put up your nieces and nephews for the scholarship, which has been a long-standing tradition.  Now you're in a relationship and you consider yourself closer to your gf's son, so you don't bother looking out for your family anymore? Did you really forget about Camille being a senior or did you want to curry favor with your girlfriend and her son? You acted a little shady and are justifying it after the fact and your siblings are acting a little entitled. The fair thing to do would have been to put both up for the scholarship and let your boss decide.", "YTA.\n\nYour niece must think you really hate her. She has better academics, and (legally) Eric isn't a relative so technically shouldn't even be eligible.", "YTA\n\nyou chose your dick over your family because you're just incredibly self-obsessed. the fact that you don't know how old youe nieces and nephews are says you care about no one but yourself.", "You\u2019re a good man. NTA", "How much is this scholarship?", "NTA, and having taught advisory to high school kids, I will note that I was telling them in the fall to double check on any scholarships they thought they\u2019d qualify for and to make a checklist of the deadlines.  It\u2019s their job to go after funding, not their parents\u2019 responsibility, and not yours.\n\nIt\u2019s also not your responsibility to chase down a potential scholarship recipient.  It is incumbent upon them to chase down the scholarship themselves.  That means Camille herself should have called you several months ago. THAT\u2019S what you tell her parents.", "NTA\n\nShe wasn't promised anything. Her parents just assumed that she would get it. If they really wanted her to have it they would have remembered it instead of having to be reminded of it.", "NTA. Also you never promised the scholarship. You said you would put them forward, they all sound very entitled.", "NTA that's basically your son at that point. They expected you to do it which makes it so much worse. What's so great about finding a partner is that you wsnt to be with that person. You're stuck with family no matter how shitty they are. You're not an asshole.", "look you did nothing wong but at the last when u said hes more important to u thats a bit bs cause u've known him less than 3 years and u've known ur neice all her life. are you just saying this so ur gf wont break up with you? just asking out of respect sir", "NTA \nI think it\u2019s nice that you made your family aware of this benefit. I also think that you informed them of what was needed in order to receive this benefit. It\u2019s not your responsibility to remind or ask and while that would\u2019ve been simple to do their kid is their responsibility.", "INFO: \"I have a much better relationship with him than Camille\" - Who's fault is that? Did you put in any effort to have a relationship with your niece?\n\nAlso, I'd go NTA if not for your last thoughts... that you'd basically rig the contest and cut out your neice to benefit Eric, even though she is a better student.\n\nIt just sounds like you a prioritizing a friend/lover's kid over family but trying to explain it away so you don't have to fully admit it.\n\nI mean, it's also suspect you can't even remember you neice is graduating this year... which leads me to believe that you put little effort into really knowing her anyway", "NTA. Sounds like Eric is family though! :)", "That has happened several times, twice with my own kids. My sisters and I all had kids over a period of just a few years.", "There is a LOT of assumption here. Do you usually assume the worst in people?", "It is amazing to me how you didn't give a thought about how his stepson would feel... The kid OP actually has a relationship with.\n\nSure, this will suck for Camille. But Eric is a person too. He also deserves that money.", "He can\u2019t actually give it to anyone. He can give their names to his boss who makes the actual determination.", "I was going to write a clever comment but somehow can\u2019t remember it", "Not like I can do anything if the worlds ending anyway, may as well sit back and have a drink", "Someone he sees as a son getting a scholarship over his niece isn't a bad thing lmao."]}
