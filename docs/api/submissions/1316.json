To a point where we would play board games, card games ect in spare time. Go to their house to watch UFC, parties, UFC at pubs ect. Believing we're friends. \n\nI'd always be around to cover teaching kickboxing, submission wrestling, and gi bjj classes. I even taught  a load of classes to keep the gym open when they went on vacation a couple times. Cleaned mats, bathrooms ect. Even had scheduled classes of my own to teach at one point. An avid competitor for their gym. My medals decorate a fair chunk of wall. I'd travel with other students to coach them when the owners couldn't. Because of all this I haven't had to pay to train in the last 8 or 9 years. Not exactly sure but I honestly can't remember when I last paid for membership. \n\nSince covid shut down a lot of gyms training tapered off. They even loaned me spare mats to set up in my home during covid. \n\nA few things happened: \n\nMy SO stopped training there due to.... Issues. My SO fought for them as an amateur on fight cards. My SO felt their training was becoming limited by the number of classes they were also teaching for them. So my SO chose to stop training with them and train at another gym. After a couple years away my SO had since taken a fight and won under the new coaches just recently. Until that point they had no idea my SO was still training or had another amateur fight. And they haven't even mentioned it to me, said to say hello or congrats. \n\nWe had a baby near the end of the covid. The baby is 9 months. So my time is taken up from being a gym rat. \n\nAnother student who is at odds with me skill wise took over teaching as frequently as I use to due to my life. \n\nWe're private people. Like nobody knew we had begun dating for over a year, that we got married, or even knew we had had a child. So I never told anyone my SO was still training. \n\nI got back into competition in Aug. After a long lay off. Trained a lot, for free, to lose weight and sharpen up. I did pretty good for 3 years off. Since I've trained 4 times in the last 2 months.\n\nCome Nov I sign up for a class in the morning. I go to recheck the class time in the evening and I'm no longer signed up and I need to buy membership. Then get a message from one of them saying my year membership was up, it's been 6 months since they renewed it, and cause we aren't exchanging teaching for membership I need to buy one. \n\nAITA for feeling I shouldn't have to pay after nearly of decade of not and for inviting their students to train free at my house in my spare time? I have no proof, but I feel it's for my SO training elsewhere and me supporting them doing that and not telling them. Like it's their business. I'm not scratching their back anymore. But after so long suddenly I need to pay my dues just after my SO publically announces their success after a lot of adversity achieving that goal.", "created_utc": 1667594169, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym9ome/aita_for_thinking_i_shouldnt_pay_to_train/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I started training BJJ 15 years ago with my son and wife. Mostly for the son, but since we were there every night, the wife and I started getting on the mat too. Giving you my background because I am very familiar with your situation regarding your relationship with the owners. I had my own key to the dojo in case we wanted to train when normal hours were not open. So my judgment is YTA. But softly. It\u2019s easy to feel you are more family than customers after being there so long. So when you put the personal feelings aside and bring it back to a customer/owner relationship and since you are no longer trading your teaching time for gym dues, you should pay.", "YTA.  \nThey stated you were no longer getting a free membership because you were no longer teaching classes there. That makes perfect sense. You are no longer business partners.", "YTA\n\nBusiness is business. They have a business to run.", "YTA\n\n\nThe benefit for being in business with them was you didn't need to pay for a membership.\n\n\nYou are no longer in business with them so now you got to pay.", "YTA. You got a free membership in exchange for working and giving classes there. Now that you're no longer working or giving classes there, you need to pay for a gym membership.", "Alright this I feel hold the most weight so far. I had a key too lol", "Exactly"]}
