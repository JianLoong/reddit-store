{"id": 10769, "submission_id": "11ad5ik", "title": "AITA for refusing to send money to help my older half sister anymore?", "selftext": "My older half sister has asked me, once again, to send money to her so she can support her kids, my nieces. At first, for the first few months, I did. But today, I\u2019ve put my foot down and stopped, much to the dismay of her mother, who is angry that I am refusing to support my sister any longer. But I have my reasons.\n\nSo for some background, before my dad moved to the US, he had kids in his home country of Trinidad who we sort of stayed in contact with through phone calls, so I always knew about them but we weren\u2019t as close as my siblings who I share a mom and dad with as we only talked like three times a year. We lived completely separate lives. The eldest is my half sister, who\u2019s six years older than me [20f]. They grew up in a poor part of Trinidad, won\u2019t specify, and as much as my dad would send money back, without a father figure and much money they struggled. As a result, they didn\u2019t make the smartest life choices - especially my half sister. At first, I didn\u2019t understand why my parents, as much as they loved/liked her, thought she wasn\u2019t the smartest. As I grew older, I understood.\n\nMy sister had her first child at sixteen to an older man, so for that I can\u2019t fault her as it was a bad situation. Though she had the choice to finish education, she dropped out and took care of her kids full time and didn\u2019t work, relying on the support of her mom, the child\u2019s dad, sometimes my dad and the community. She then, keeping in mind she doesn\u2019t work, went on to have three more kids with I don\u2019t know who. All are old enough to go to school. However, even with the community help, it\u2019s not enough and they\u2019re struggling. A few months ago, we reconnected through social media and we began talking. After a few weeks, she swallowed her pride and asked me to send money back. Me, while not making much money (I\u2019m a student but I work part time) but having enough spare income, agreed and I sent the US equivalent of $70. She was happy. After a month, she asked again. I sent it. After a month, she asked again - you see where I\u2019m going with this. The issue is, with the increased cost of living, I\u2019m not able to do this anymore as I don\u2019t have enough money to spare anymore. The money that I can send back won\u2019t be enough, they\u2019ve told me this. She\u2019s upset at this, and so is her mother. At first, I did feel obliged to help but when I couldn\u2019t anymore, I had to stop. They have this misconception that everyone in America is wealthier, so they have more money to give. I tried to clarify that this isn\u2019t my situation, I come from a paycheck to paycheck family and support myself with no help from them at all. They also don\u2019t understand my frustration at her not getting a job to support herself, they\u2019re saying she needs to focus on her kids as they\u2019re young. Simultaneously, I also understand that they\u2019re struggling badly and raising four kids as a single mother isn\u2019t easy. They insist I\u2019m being selfish and that I should continue sending money to them.

I\u2019m from Trinidad and at one point worked in a school, and unfortunately, I\u2019ve seen a lot of situations like this, with single moms having many kids and refusing to get a job. \n\nThing is, when it comes to minimum wage jobs, there are always vacancies available (my friends applying to minimum wage jobs get called back frequently). So it\u2019s not impossible to get a job and make an income. \n\nTbh, I think it\u2019s a mentality. I remember at one point my neighbor and his family were barely making it by, and his wife still refused to get a job. \n\nAt this point, if you continue to give her money, you\u2019re not helping her, you\u2019re enabling her.", "NTA - You did what you could and she should be grateful. You have a big heart but you need to take care of yourself and your family first.", "NTA. You don't owe anyone your money.", "NTA.  It is fundamentally kind of you to want to help her, but you cannot afford to supplement her income, nor should you be expected to on a long term basis.  Don\u2019t allow your sympathy for her circumstances to make you into a human ATM.  She is angry that you set a boundary, but her anger is misplaced.  You\u2019ve done more than you should have for her as it is.", "NTA. She's a mooch and will take advantage as much as you let her.", "NTA.  You do not owe any duty to support her. None.  Stop and take care of your own situation.  Do not listen to what others say.  pull back and make sure you are taking care of yourself first.", "NTA I am really sorry you're half sister is in a situation that isn't pleasant, but this is a situation of her own making. Bailing her out for the last how many months has done nothing! She takes money from you but she does nothing to better herself. Admittedly I don't know damn thing about Trinidad, but I find it hard to believe that there's not something she can do while the kids are in school to make some money? I mean they have the internet right? Can't she do some of these online jobs? Even the ones that don't pay that much...it's better than nothing!\n\nI also feel this way about my friends who are supporting distant family in other countries. Handouts are only a good idea if the person receiving them is making an effort to better their situation. By your statements she's not, and she doesn't plan on it. You don't owe her children support. In fact one could argue that the longer you do support them the more they'll come to rely on it, so it would be better to cut it off now.", "INFO: How did you reconnect? Did you reach out to her or vice versa? In either case NTA but if she reached out to you, you maybe be being used", "NTA. Other people are not entitled to your stuff, whether or not they are family. I lend my sister money because I know she'll pay it back when she can. I wouldn't lend her money if she didn't.", "NTA. You have no obligation to send her money, and you have have no obligation to explain yourself. If you are asked again to send money, simply answer, \"No.\" Do not explain why.

Wake up and put a stop to it", "NTA - you helped a great deal, your half sister should have said thank you for helping when you could, but I understand it is no longer possible.

And this is even worse. While yes, she is family, she\u2019s also someone who doesn\u2019t seem to be in your life, as well as someone who seemed to have a hand in her own misfortune\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to strain your relationship with her, tell her you\u2019re struggling somewhat and can only send her very small amounts occasionally. (I know this is unethical, but sometimes it needs to be done to avoid family drama)", "If you, and your family want and are in a position to help financially, offer to pay for services, like education for your sister, childcare if she's studying or working etc. If she wants to better the life of her children than she needs to put effort in, and if she puts in the effort and there's services that would benefit her then that's where you can help. Do Not pay the money direct to her. Pay the school, childcare, whatever, direct. If she gets angry, she gets nothing. But don't do this to your own detriment. There's an old saying \"give a man a fish, he eats for a day: give a man a fishing pole he can sustain himself\". Giving your sister cash is a short term benefit, paying so that she can better herself is an investment. Again, only if you and your family can afford it. It may be something that you revisit when you've working and self sufficient.", "NTA.  This is another situation where you could be setting yourself on fire to keep her and her kids warm.  Inflation in the US is crazy so just stand your ground and don\u2019t send her any more money.", "NTA. I think the only reason she reconnected with you was so she could get you to give her money.", "NTA- You didn't knock her up why are you responsible for supporting her and her kids. Your parents should send the money if they are so concerned or maybe send some birth control and job applications so she gets the hint.", "You actually have done more than most people would already \n\nIf you haven't got it you haven't got it. \n\nIt's not as if you are rich and blowing them off; you have no obligation to lose your place or go hungry for her. She should hit the dads up for money or take them to court.\n\nNTA", "Nta..\n\n Not your kids not your problem.", "NTA,I'm also from Trinidad,the $70 US you sent is the equivalent to 475.25TTD thats enough money,but your half sister should be going after the father of her kids for child support.", "NTA. You need to take care of yourself first. They are not your children. Sister needs to learn how to take care of her children herself.", "Your 14. NTA.", "Can confirm. Have the same issues with spouse's family. Nothing will ever be enough.", "She reached out first now that I think about it, as she contacted my mom saying she wanted to speak with us (me and my other siblings) more. One of the first things she mentioned was money issues when we first spoke :/", "He is struggling \n\nIt's not a lie", "Pretty sure OP is 20 and half sister is 26.", "Classic mooch. I bet every family member of all her exes has been hit up the same way \n\nShe may actually pull down more than you\n\nEdit for NTA", "And that still doesn\u2019t make the OP an AH\nI\u2019d give money to a struggling neighbor before I gave to a long lost family member I haven\u2019t seen in years", "There's a whole industry of this on the web.", "NTA for not sending her money but I don\u2019t think you really understand the reality of her situation. There is such a stigma about asking for birth control in Trinidad it\u2019s unreal. I had a teenager ask me if they can you Saran Wrap in place of condom last year. \n\nI can remember a time I. The country when girls had to have their parents permission to get birth control. Likewise women needed their husbands permission to get their tubes tied or to go on birth control. Of course a lot of that has changed, but it takes much longer for attitudes, stigma, and ignorance to change.", "NTA. Lighting yourself on fire doesn't keep other people warm for long.", "You do understand that she *only* made contact with you so that she could demand money from you?\n\nWatch how fast she drops contract with you when you stop sending money. \n\nNot compete lack of contact though - she will intermittently get back in touch until she is thoroughly sure you will never send money again. \n\nSending occasional money is the worst option. Each bank transfer you make will cause 3 years of occasional texting from her to see if she can get a repeat performance.", "Being from Trinidad and immigrating I see this from a different perspective.  The biggest question I have is why didn't OP's dad apply for papers for his daughter he left behind, he's had 20 years to do so.  Maybe the sister would have had a different mentality if he'd done so.  Many Trinidadian men move to America and start new lives have new families and salve their conscience by sending a fist full of US dollars back home and because of the exchange rate, they think they're doing something.\n\nI mean OP NTA for not wanting to send money but I suspect the biggest AH here is daddy."]}
