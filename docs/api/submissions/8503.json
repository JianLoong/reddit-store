My wife (37F) and I have two 8 and 9 year old daughters. \n\nMy SIL rightfully is very concerned with caring for their son.

My nephew was with my brother. Somewhere in the conversation, she mentioned how she was being very careful and was going to avoid giving her son any potentially allergenic food like peanuts or citrus fruit until he was a few years older. She said her pediatrician advised her to do that.\n\nI remember from back in the day that both my wife and our kids' pediatrician had recommended for us to introduce these food categories into their diet as soon as we could, because it reduced the chances of them developing allergies later on. I mentioned this to my SIL. She laughed and loudly commented that her pediatrician sure knew a lot more than I did and he was very experienced and that I had it wrong. Suddenly everyone's attention was on us.\n\nNow my wife is a doctor. She is a specialist but she literally lives and breathes medicine. So since she was already looking at us, I asked her if giving peanuts and other potentially allergic food categories earlier was medically advised. \n\nShe went on to explain the pilot studies, previous views, the mechanisms and etc. Mentioned how this idea my SIL mentioned was now no longer considered standard and even cited several recent articles that indicated indeed, introducing them earlier was a much better idea and supported by evidence. \n\nMy brother thanked her and said it was good that they found out soon enough. I thought that was the end of it. As we were leaving however, my SIL told me I had been rude and embarrassed her in front of my wife. \n\nThe next day my mother also told me I had been very rude to my SIL and undermined her and that I should make it up to her and my brother. \n\nWas I in the wrong here?", "created_utc": 1674898891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nbac8/aita_for_unintentionally_embarrassing_my_sil/", "score": 478, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

All you did was give her good information, which she should have been appreciative of for the sake of her child. Instead, she focused only on her feelings. I would probably attempt to clear the air, though, just so future family gatherings aren't awkward.", "NTA, I am all in favour of being polite and holding one's views for a private moment later if they disagree politely too.

But due to that advise pediatricians saw an unprecedented rise in children being diagnosed with food allergies and ended up reverting back to introduce your child to them early.\n\nSo NTA especially since your wife actually knows what she was talking about.
