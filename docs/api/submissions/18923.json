This is what happened:\n\nA few years ago my brother got divorced. As part of that his ex-wife was ordered to pay him spousal support because of the laws in our province/country about income differences between divorcing couples. If he was to move in with a girlfriend or get married the spousal support would end. He did move in with his girlfriend over a year ago but he officially told his ex-wife and the court system that he was living at my house. (Just to be clear, my brother and I haven't lived in the same house since he was 18 and I was 14 and he's never lived in my house). I don't know how his ex-wife found out or how it came out but she took him back to court over it because the spousal support was something like $5600 per month and he was supposed to get no more if he moved in with someone else. I had to testify in court that my brother has never lived in my house. My brother is mad because he begged me to say he did live here. He flat out told me he lied to the court system because he hasn't worked since the divorce went through and he didn't want to lose the support payment. No way I was going to lie in court. I believe in helping family but not if it means breaking the law. In this case the court already had a copy of the lease he signed for his apartment so they would have known I lied. But my brother and some other people (my mom, one of my sisters, my uncle etc) are mad that I told the truth in court even though my brother asked me not to.\n\nSo I have to ask: AITA for telling the truth despite what my brother said? I would have thought the answer was obvious but I'm getting so much flack, and not just from my brother.

You did the right thing 1000%", "NTA\n\nThere are circumstances where I would lie for one of my brothers. Testifying under oath in a courtroom is not one of them.", "I'm not lying in court for anybody. You get in trouble for that.

No one should be that selfish to ask you to lie in court. Does he expect you to accept the consequences of lying just so that he can have some free money? What would your brother or family have done if you got caught? Probably nothing I\u2019m guessing! Tell your family that if they are so concerned with your brother stealing money from his ex wife that they should allow your brother to list their address instead", "Oh, hell no you are not the AH. You did the right thing.", "NTA. When it is something to do with the court system, it is NEVER a good idea to lie to cover up for someone, even if it is your brother. He\u2019s the one who decided to lie. Will he help you if you get into trouble for covering for him (Because you can also get sued for this). Of course, he won\u2019t.\n\nTo everyone who criticise you, I would tell them to mind their own f-ing business.", "NTA.

Your brother is committing fraud and you would be an accomplice to it. He and all these other family members are wrong. You should never perjure yourself either.

He owes her a lot of money and should be paying back every cent that he was not entitled to.\n\nYou've got morals... they don't.", "NTA \n\nur brother was just being weirdly greedy, ... and stupid. He could have just not lived with his gf and it would all be fine \n\nInfo request was the gf he lived with the mistress??", "NTA.\n\nYour brother on the other hand, is clearly one. And so is the rest of the family for enabling this self-centered, lazy ass man to take advantage of his hard working ex-wife.", "If you had lied, and the truth came out, you could have been arrested for perjury, and the penalties for that can get fairly serious.  Expecting you to lie for him in a court of law goes WAY beyond what even family can expect from one another. Your brother is a lazy, dishonest parasite, and deserves no sympathy. Anyone who agrees with him... are wrong.  Again, perjury is a big deal.  NTA", "NTA Favors cease when the law is involved.", "NTA  \n\n\nThe situation was already shitty when he used your address without your permission, but then he wanted you to commit perjury, and a pretty obvious one, without any good reason? It's time he stopped blaming other people for his problems and deal with it.", "NTA - so your brother perjured himself and expected you to do the same? Just for money? Heck no, you are NTA. He made his bed (and not in your apartment!), so he has to lie in it. Lie being the key word.\n\nLots of people can stick their noses in someone elses business. Too bad your bro can't get $5600 per month for doing nothing. Time to grow up, get a job and move on with life with his new gf. Loser people tend to pull people down to their level (sorry to use harsh words, but I think you know this is true).", "NTA,\n\nI\u2019m all for having family back in certain situations. But breaking the law is definitely not one of them. I just can\u2019t grasp how your family thinks you should\u2019ve committed perjury.  Good on you for doing the right thing", "NTA. You wouldn't be anyway, but they have proof that he's been living somewhere else, so it would have been *especially* stupid for you to lie. Your family is full of idiots.", "NTA they aren\u2019t the ones that would have suffered the consequences of being charged with perjury. I bet none of the people who are calling you an AH would have lied for him either if they were in your place.", "No. Ignore anyone who tells you otherwise. Your brother made his bed, now he has to lie in it.  If laws are the same as where I live , lying in court could have gotten YOU in legal trouble. So   don't even pay any attention. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA omg are you the only one in your Danilo with morals?", "NTA - lying to a court is not something you should ever do!", "INFO: did he inform you at the time that he was telling the court and his ex that he was living at your place? Did you give him your permission to do so?\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t be TA in either case, lying to a court in his behalf would be crazy. But maybe it would give some insight into where the reactions from the family are coming from.", "NTA - with or without you, the court would know. Your brother is a loser living off his ex\u2019s money. He needs to stop lying and living off someone else\u2019s money. Absolutely disgusting behavior and I can see why he\u2019s divorced.", "Nta. In the UK that's classed as perjury. A very serious crime that can have serious repercussions. You can't set yourself on fire to keep others warm", "NTA. Ask your mom and sisters )and anyone else who is mad you didn\u2019t lie) if they would be willing go to jail for perjury for lying in court.", "I have no clue.\n\nIt's called perjury here too and there is jail time as well.", "He had a job the entire time they were married, but he quit once the spousal support order came through. I don't even think he saved much of it which is wild to me.", ">scam his ex wife technically out of 5K$\n\n$5600 **per month**.

It feels insane that I even have to ask if I'm wrong.", "I don't understand exactly what her job is but she works as a scientist in the nuclear industry. Before the divorce my brother was an auto glass repair technician (he installed or replaced windshields). My understanding is that there was a formula based on both their incomes to determine the spousal support.", "He hasn't had a job since he got divorced. He isn't working at the moment, though right now that's the least of his problems.", "Her job is a scientist of some kind in the nuclear industry. My brother used to be an auto glass technician.", ">was the gf he lived with the mistress??\n\nNo, my brother only met her more than a year after the divorce became final. The divorce was not because of infidelity on either side.", "In your family\u2026 I don\u2019t know where Danilo came from or how to edit.", "So, he would be ok with you going to jail, while he just gets cut off financially? He's not much of a brother and I don't see any of your other family standing up for him in court on the chance they would go to jail. Your brother is some kind of stupid for signing a lease for another place and trying to say he lives with you.", "NTA. You did the right thing. You were ordered to appear as part of a subpeona and he had lied to the court. He committed a crime and expected you to commit one too.", "Did he just expect to live off her forever and never work again? You did the right thing don't let him make you feel bad because he's got to get a job n not live off others!", "Exactly, the audacity of the brother and the family too blaming OP is ridiculous", "Holy crap that's a lot of money in spousal support.  She must be on big bucks to be paying that.\n\nI hope your brother is forced to pay back every cent of that money.", "Ignore them. They are idiots. If they want to get jailed, it\u2019s their choice.

You did the right thing.", "Ask all these people if they\u2019d have been cool with you going to jail for perjury. Were they going to pay your bail and get you an attorney? No? Because that\u2019s what would\u2019ve happened since they already had evidence with the lease signed by your brother. \n\nNTA.", "Your mother is a surprising member of those voices. I would tell her that she must think so little of you if she thinks you should sit inside a jail cell just to 'save' your brother - which, as you pointed out, would have been utterly pointless because they already had the lease proving he wasn't living with you. So your mother wants you to basically go to jail for no reason. NTA.", "Oh my mistake. I thought he was now working. Well, he\u2019s definitely in a load of trouble that\u2019s for sure. You did the right thing and anyone that says otherwise doesn\u2019t seem to realize or care about the consequences", "I have no clue. The spousal support wasn't ordered for life so I don't know what he was going to do.", "Sounds to me like he wanted to live off his ex and his current gf since he moved into her place.", "Bum off the next girl, presumably.", "I don't believe his current girlfriend has a job, but I could be wrong on that. I'm not 100% sure if she has an income of her own."]}
