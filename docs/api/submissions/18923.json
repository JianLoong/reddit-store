If he was to move in with a girlfriend or get married the spousal support would end. He did move in with his girlfriend over a year ago but he officially told his ex-wife and the court system that he was living at my house.

I don't know how his ex-wife found out or how it came out but she took him back to court over it because the spousal support was something like $5600 per month and he was supposed to get no more if he moved in with someone else. I had to testify in court that my brother has never lived in my house. My brother is mad because he begged me to say he did live here. He flat out told me he lied to the court system because he hasn't worked since the divorce went through and he didn't want to lose the support payment. No way I was going to lie in court. I believe in helping family but not if it means breaking the law. In this case the court already had a copy of the lease he signed for his apartment so they would have known I lied. But my brother and some other people (my mom, one of my sisters, my uncle etc) are mad that I told the truth in court even though my brother asked me not to.\n\nSo I have to ask: AITA for telling the truth despite what my brother said?

He made his bed (and not in your apartment!), so he has to lie in it. Lie being the key word.\n\nLots of people can stick their noses in someone elses business.

I was only asked two questions. First, if my brother has lived with me since X date, and second if my brother had asked me if he could use my address to lie to the court. The answer to both was no and I answered truthfully.\n\n>If so, does he have to pay last year's spousal support amount to ex wife? Will he go to jail for lying to court?\n\nI don't know.
