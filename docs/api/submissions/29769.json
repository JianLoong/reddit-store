But there is a consequence to that: Now the family doesn't know why OP was such a hard-ass about drinking. That makes it difficult for them to understand why OP behaved the way they did, which probably explains their reaction. Again, there is nothing wrong with that because we already established OP is under no obligation to explain, but then OP has to accept that they're never going to understand.\n\ntl;dr: OP is in the right for being a hard-ass and is under no obligation to explain themselves, but that means the family doesn't understand and will react accordingly.", "No", "I think most people do understand the difference between wine and coffee.", "Yeah their comment in brackets is suspicious.\n\nBut question, why must it be on their own dime? Are you in the USA? Is that why? I mean people who are addicted to cigarettes, or sugar and inevitably get ill or cancer from smoking/eating, their treatments are paid for by the government where I live. And cigarettes+sugar are more of a choice than addiction to alcohol. If it saves a life, then I say it's worth the investment in treating it", "it would depend on the level of unacceptability that we're talking about here having a glass of wine is okay graffitiing my walls and pissing on the carpet is not. there is a stark difference between those behaviors", "No problem!", "The fact that the OP was just grabbing take out and she was already drinking wine implied this was well into the evening, possibly late at night. And he just booted her after she'd been drinking. And for her to be staying with him for a week means she probably doesn't live anywhere near there, and quite possibly doesn't know anybody else in town. If she doesn't have a car, she might be SOL for getting anywhere else that night. And even if she does have a car, she shouldn't be driving if she was drinking wine. But that's probably exactly what happened. He kicked her out when she might not have had a viable, safe option for anywhere to go for that night, and (while possibly tipsy or even drunk) she took a drive to find a motel or a long, long drive home. \n\nThe least he could have said was \"plan to be out in the morning.\" Again, his throwing her out so suddenly is an over reaction. She's not blameless either, but having THAT level of inflexibility, especially about something that likely had zero negative impact on the OP, is what makes a lot of people assholes.\n\nBreaking a rule in such a minor way shouldn't give the rule imposer carte blanche to impose whatever punishment they damn will please. The infraction had already happened, and wasn't apparently hurting anybody. The goal at that point is to make sure it doesn't happen again, and there's absolutely ways to do that without kicking her out immediately.", "Oo you got me, the two things I used to make a comparison are not literally the same thing.", "Mate that\u2019s subjective I have a mate that wouldn\u2019t give to shits about people drawing on his wall.

He had a clear, defined boundary and she chose to violate it.  \n\nActions meet consequences.  Sucks to be her but then again I like wine and would've picked somewhere else to stay.  She wanted to stay for FREE AND have her way.  She not only boundary stomped, she doubled down...Its OP's damn house!  At that point of her \"no\",  I would've been like \"Then B get the F outta my house!\"  Forget whatever time of night it was.  You want to disrespect me like that,  I won't give a damn about you!

In my opinion, she threw herself out.", "She was wrong for doing it but having a glass of wine in someone's apartment seems like a pretty simple and easy to make mistake and it seems like you may have reacted in a bit of an asshole way.", "NTA.\n\nYour house, your rules, simple as that.
