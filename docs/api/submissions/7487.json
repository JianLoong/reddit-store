For some reason, he really dislikes his best friend's (Daniel's) girlfriend, Lila. \n\nI don't exactly get the reason for his dislike, my guess is that Aiden and Daniel were kind of outcasts in high school and Aiden adapted this \"us against the world\" view with his only friend. Lila on the other hand is a very lively, outgoing, bubbly girl with tons of friends.\n\nAiden's newest reason to dislike Lila is that Daniel plans to take her to an all expenses paid trip abroad. He was ranting to me about Lila being a gold-digger and using Daniel for his money.\n\nI tried to tell him that Daniel taking his girlfriend on a vacation doesn't make said girlfriend a gold-digger, but Aiden couldn't be reasoned with.\n\nIt bothered me so much, especially since my family took Aiden to countless vacations free of charge back when we were still in university. I mean 15+ vacations, mostly to different countries.\n\nI pointed out to Aiden that he came to plenty of vacations with me and my family,  but he said that was different, because he only came for me, so that I have more fun with him there with me and we build shared memories.\n\nI asked him why is what Daniel and Lila are doing any different. Daniel can afford to take Lila with him, he will have more fun with her there and they will make wonderful shared memories. If that makes Lila a gold-digger, he must be a gold-digger too, by his own standards.\n\nAiden got mad at me and said that he is extremely disappointed and hurt that I look at him like that. He got really offended and now seems to think that I actually accused him of being a gold-digger instead of just trying to show him the error in his reasoning.\n\nWas I wrong for trying to draw a parallel between him and Lila? I didn't want to make him feel bad for coming with us on those vacations, I loved having him there. Do I owe him an apology?

The situations are actually pretty similar.", "NTA sometimes the truth hurts and people don't like looking in the mirror.", "NTA - it seems like your bf really hates that someone else takes his friends attention, its very similar in my opinion and you did a good job relating. If you're going to hate someone, at least have a good reason lol", "NTA Aiden seems determined to dislike Lila and can't be reasoned out of it. I think you can say that you don't believe he's a golddigger and you loved having him with you on your holidays without offering an apology. There's no reason for you to be sorry you made a very reasonable point and he is choosing to twist it into an insult so he doesn't have to acknowledge he is wrong.", "Spoiler alert: Aidan is into Lila.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your comparison is spot on. A bit mean but valid.", "NTA, it's a fair comparison in that a free trip was provided for both Aiden and Lila.\n\nWhat I do think you need to do in this situation is dig into *why* Aiden can't be happy for his friend. And I would gently caution him because if he keeps having issues with Lila, its going to drive a wedge between him and Daniel.", "NTA.\n\nHe is being very hypocritical.\n\nYou didn't accuse him of being a gold digger. You said if she is a gold digger for this reason that that means YOU are calling YOURSELF a gold digger.\n\nHe has a very unhealthy attachment to his friend if he is not happy for him for finding love and living his best life with that person.\n\nHe gets to have love (with you) but is against his friend having the same thing?", "NtA. It's the same. Your family paid for him but now Daniel pays for Lila, different pockets but in the end neither Lila or Aiden are paying for their vacation.\n\nCould Aiden like Lila a bit and therefore be jealous? Or like Daniel? Why care if Daniel is with Lila, as long as he's happy.", "NTA. your boyfriend seems to have an unhealthy attatchment to his mate, he sounds jealous.", "NTA I can't get over your boyfriend claiming that he only went on free international vacations for you. I mean first of all, the audacity to asse you can only have fun with him there....(yes, I'm sure you have fun with him, but am also pretty sure you can have fun on a vacation with your family without him and there are memories the two of you can build that don't require free vacations)\n\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think he'll realize his hypocrisy but I also don't think you need to apologize. I would keep an eye out for more pink flags though, his actions to isolate his friend and him turning himself into the victim after you tried pointing out his hypocrisy are setting off my manipulation warning sirens.", "NTA.  You're right.  You're not accusing him of being a gold digger - you're trying to show that Lila is NOT a gold digger.  He's all twisted up and grasping at reasons to dislike Lila.", "NTA. He was being a screaming hypocrite. You were only pointing out the reality of the situation. If he doesn\u2019t like that, he has a lot of looking in the mirror to do.", ">He got really offended and now seems to think that I actually accused him of being a gold-digger instead of just trying to show him the error in his reasoning.\n\nHe got your reasoning, he's just digging in because he doesn't want to admit he's wrong, so now he's trying to redirect the argument to make you feel guilty. He just wants to be able to complain further about Lila with you sitting there offering encouraging words.\n\nHis dislike of Lila is unreasonable, so trying to use reason and logic to get him out of his dislike of her isn't going to work.\n\nNTA, but I don't thin any arguments are going to convince him otherwise.", "NTA something something glass houses something something stones", "Nta completely fair comparison", "NTA. You brought up a fair point and he couldn\u2019t handle it. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe him an apology. \n\nWhy is he so fixated on Lila though?", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re right though. Going off his logic, then he is a gold digger. You and your family took him on plenty of vacations, so again going off his logic he is using you and your family for y\u2019all money. \n\nObviously, I\u2019m not actually saying he is doing that but it just makes no sense how he calls Lila a gold digger for accepting the all expense paid vacation from Daniel but yet he went on a bunch of vacations with you and your family. The hypocrisy is strong with this guy", "NTA. Aiden is extremely jealous of Lila and likely is attracted to her. Younger guys can sometimes take on this bully mentality against girls that they like but can never actually have. She could be the most perfect girlfriend in the world and he would still find something bad to say about her. He should come to terms with his behavior before he starts obsessing over Lila and her relationship.", "NTA your argument is sound and Aiden is turning it around on you because he\u2019s embarrassed he got caught out with his faulty and misogynistic logic. \n\nThis antipathy towards Lila is quite worrying though. Either there\u2019s something about her that you don\u2019t know, or, and I hate to be one of those redditors but do you think he\u2019s possibly overcompensating? There\u2019s something more to this than meets the eye in my opinion.", "NTA. I\u2019m guessing Aiden is either into Daniel or Lila.", "It seems to me like Aiden is jealous for Daniel spending more time with his girlfriend, and that leading to him spending less time with Aiden. This could mean that he's subconsciously looking for reasons to be angry at Lila or disliking her, he could be seeing her as an obstacle to his friendship with Daniel. Kind of ironic considering he has a girlfriend too. (This is my interpretation, though, and I could be wrong).\n\nNTA, anyway. It seems that he misinterpreted the comparison. I think you should try to explain to him that it was meant to prove that Lila is not a gold digger rather than accusing him of being one.\n\nThe logic would be sort of like \"if you're not a gold-digger, then that means neither is Lila\".", "Hell no you\u2019re NTA. He\u2019s literally doing what his bestie\u2019s gf is doing, accompanying her SO on a trip. He\u2019s just upset that his bestie is being \u201ctaken\u201d by his gf. Like, it\u2019s okay for me to have a gf but you can F**k off and be single for me bro!", "NTA. Some people just can\u2019t be reasoned with.", "NTA. OP\u2019s bf thinks gold diggers can only be female. He\u2019s a male so he was sacrificing to go on vacations.\n\nMy other theory is he always pitied that friend was an outcast and depended on bf being his only friend. He is jealous that the friend has someone else now.", "NTA. \n\nSomeone else commented they think your boyfriend might have a thing for Lila\u2026 I don\u2019t agree. If anything, he seems jealous of her, and her relationship with Daniel - does he maybe have a thing for his best friend and doesn\u2019t (or is unable to) realise it?", "NTA, but I suspect that your boyfriend has a thing for Lila.", "NTA - but it is concerning to me that your boyfriend refuses to see reason, even when presented with it in a fairly easy to understand parallel involving him and his own lived experiences. Even worse, when you try to show him this reason, he starts gaslighting you to make it seem like you need to apologize to him. And that\u2019s not even getting into how bizarre it is that he has such a (seemingly) unfounded hatred of his best friend\u2019s gf. Nothing in this interaction seems okay to me. If this is representative of your relationship (and maybe even if it isn\u2019t), I would have questions.", "NTA\n\nIt's a valid point.\n\nI suspect your boyfriend's problem with Lila is that he's got a little crush.", "NTA. You made valid points.", "I don't think you owe him an apology. I get what you are saying here.", "NTA. He's a misogynist.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to show him that he is overlooking some of the same things that he is doing.  You were trying to show him that he needs to lay off her because he was being a hypocrite.  I really hope he isn't like this in other situations where he cannot acknowledge the error of his ways.  Have you asked him if he has any other reasons for his feelings about her? Could there be things he hasn't told you that his friend has mentioned?", "NTA.  Aiden\u2019s got some hangups.

Gaslighting is \" a form of psychological manipulation in which the abuser attempts to sow self-doubt and confusion in their victim's mind.\" It's a mild form of gaslighting, but Aiden is still causing OP self-doubt by trying to convince her that she called him a gold-digger, and OP is now even considering giving him an apology. It's not as bad as a lot of gaslighting examples, but it still counts", "Yeah, the whole thing was setting off red flags.
