For some reason, he really dislikes his best friend's (Daniel's) girlfriend, Lila. \n\nI don't exactly get the reason for his dislike, my guess is that Aiden and Daniel were kind of outcasts in high school and Aiden adapted this \"us against the world\" view with his only friend. Lila on the other hand is a very lively, outgoing, bubbly girl with tons of friends.\n\nAiden's newest reason to dislike Lila is that Daniel plans to take her to an all expenses paid trip abroad. He was ranting to me about Lila being a gold-digger and using Daniel for his money.\n\nI tried to tell him that Daniel taking his girlfriend on a vacation doesn't make said girlfriend a gold-digger, but Aiden couldn't be reasoned with.\n\nIt bothered me so much, especially since my family took Aiden to countless vacations free of charge back when we were still in university. I mean 15+ vacations, mostly to different countries.\n\nI pointed out to Aiden that he came to plenty of vacations with me and my family,  but he said that was different, because he only came for me, so that I have more fun with him there with me and we build shared memories.\n\nI asked him why is what Daniel and Lila are doing any different. Daniel can afford to take Lila with him, he will have more fun with her there and they will make wonderful shared memories. If that makes Lila a gold-digger, he must be a gold-digger too, by his own standards.\n\nAiden got mad at me and said that he is extremely disappointed and hurt that I look at him like that. He got really offended and now seems to think that I actually accused him of being a gold-digger instead of just trying to show him the error in his reasoning.\n\nWas I wrong for trying to draw a parallel between him and Lila? I didn't want to make him feel bad for coming with us on those vacations, I loved having him there. Do I owe him an apology?

The situations are actually pretty similar.", "NTA sometimes the truth hurts and people don't like looking in the mirror.", "NTA - it seems like your bf really hates that someone else takes his friends attention, its very similar in my opinion and you did a good job relating. If you're going to hate someone, at least have a good reason lol", "NTA Aiden seems determined to dislike Lila and can't be reasoned out of it. I think you can say that you don't believe he's a golddigger and you loved having him with you on your holidays without offering an apology. There's no reason for you to be sorry you made a very reasonable point and he is choosing to twist it into an insult so he doesn't have to acknowledge he is wrong.", "Spoiler alert: Aidan is into Lila.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your comparison is spot on. A bit mean but valid.", "NTA, it's a fair comparison in that a free trip was provided for both Aiden and Lila.\n\nWhat I do think you need to do in this situation is dig into *why* Aiden can't be happy for his friend. And I would gently caution him because if he keeps having issues with Lila, its going to drive a wedge between him and Daniel.", "NTA.\n\nHe is being very hypocritical.\n\nYou didn't accuse him of being a gold digger. You said if she is a gold digger for this reason that that means YOU are calling YOURSELF a gold digger.\n\nHe has a very unhealthy attachment to his friend if he is not happy for him for finding love and living his best life with that person.\n\nHe gets to have love (with you) but is against his friend having the same thing?", "NtA. It's the same. Your family paid for him but now Daniel pays for Lila, different pockets but in the end neither Lila or Aiden are paying for their vacation.\n\nCould Aiden like Lila a bit and therefore be jealous? Or like Daniel? Why care if Daniel is with Lila, as long as he's happy.", "NTA. your boyfriend seems to have an unhealthy attatchment to his mate, he sounds jealous.", "NTA I can't get over your boyfriend claiming that he only went on free international vacations for you. I mean first of all, the audacity to asse you can only have fun with him there....(yes, I'm sure you have fun with him, but am also pretty sure you can have fun on a vacation with your family without him and there are memories the two of you can build that don't require free vacations)\n\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think he'll realize his hypocrisy but I also don't think you need to apologize. I would keep an eye out for more pink flags though, his actions to isolate his friend and him turning himself into the victim after you tried pointing out his hypocrisy are setting off my manipulation warning sirens.", "NTA.  You're right.  You're not accusing him of being a gold digger - you're trying to show that Lila is NOT a gold digger.  He's all twisted up and grasping at reasons to dislike Lila.", "NTA. He was being a screaming hypocrite. You were only pointing out the reality of the situation. If he doesn\u2019t like that, he has a lot of looking in the mirror to do.", ">He got really offended and now seems to think that I actually accused him of being a gold-digger instead of just trying to show him the error in his reasoning.\n\nHe got your reasoning, he's just digging in because he doesn't want to admit he's wrong, so now he's trying to redirect the argument to make you feel guilty. He just wants to be able to complain further about Lila with you sitting there offering encouraging words.\n\nHis dislike of Lila is unreasonable, so trying to use reason and logic to get him out of his dislike of her isn't going to work.\n\nNTA, but I don't thin any arguments are going to convince him otherwise.", "NTA something something glass houses something something stones", "Nta completely fair comparison", "NTA. You brought up a fair point and he couldn\u2019t handle it. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe him an apology. \n\nWhy is he so fixated on Lila though?", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re right though. Going off his logic, then he is a gold digger. You and your family took him on plenty of vacations, so again going off his logic he is using you and your family for y\u2019all money. \n\nObviously, I\u2019m not actually saying he is doing that but it just makes no sense how he calls Lila a gold digger for accepting the all expense paid vacation from Daniel but yet he went on a bunch of vacations with you and your family. The hypocrisy is strong with this guy", "NTA. Aiden is extremely jealous of Lila and likely is attracted to her. Younger guys can sometimes take on this bully mentality against girls that they like but can never actually have. She could be the most perfect girlfriend in the world and he would still find something bad to say about her. He should come to terms with his behavior before he starts obsessing over Lila and her relationship.", "NTA your argument is sound and Aiden is turning it around on you because he\u2019s embarrassed he got caught out with his faulty and misogynistic logic. \n\nThis antipathy towards Lila is quite worrying though. Either there\u2019s something about her that you don\u2019t know, or, and I hate to be one of those redditors but do you think he\u2019s possibly overcompensating? There\u2019s something more to this than meets the eye in my opinion.", "NTA. I\u2019m guessing Aiden is either into Daniel or Lila.", "It seems to me like Aiden is jealous for Daniel spending more time with his girlfriend, and that leading to him spending less time with Aiden. This could mean that he's subconsciously looking for reasons to be angry at Lila or disliking her, he could be seeing her as an obstacle to his friendship with Daniel. Kind of ironic considering he has a girlfriend too. (This is my interpretation, though, and I could be wrong).\n\nNTA, anyway. It seems that he misinterpreted the comparison. I think you should try to explain to him that it was meant to prove that Lila is not a gold digger rather than accusing him of being one.\n\nThe logic would be sort of like \"if you're not a gold-digger, then that means neither is Lila\".", "Hell no you\u2019re NTA. He\u2019s literally doing what his bestie\u2019s gf is doing, accompanying her SO on a trip. He\u2019s just upset that his bestie is being \u201ctaken\u201d by his gf. Like, it\u2019s okay for me to have a gf but you can F**k off and be single for me bro!", "NTA. Some people just can\u2019t be reasoned with.", "NTA. OP\u2019s bf thinks gold diggers can only be female. He\u2019s a male so he was sacrificing to go on vacations.\n\nMy other theory is he always pitied that friend was an outcast and depended on bf being his only friend. He is jealous that the friend has someone else now.", "NTA. \n\nSomeone else commented they think your boyfriend might have a thing for Lila\u2026 I don\u2019t agree. If anything, he seems jealous of her, and her relationship with Daniel - does he maybe have a thing for his best friend and doesn\u2019t (or is unable to) realise it?", "NTA, but I suspect that your boyfriend has a thing for Lila.", "NTA - but it is concerning to me that your boyfriend refuses to see reason, even when presented with it in a fairly easy to understand parallel involving him and his own lived experiences. Even worse, when you try to show him this reason, he starts gaslighting you to make it seem like you need to apologize to him. And that\u2019s not even getting into how bizarre it is that he has such a (seemingly) unfounded hatred of his best friend\u2019s gf. Nothing in this interaction seems okay to me. If this is representative of your relationship (and maybe even if it isn\u2019t), I would have questions.", "NTA\n\nIt's a valid point.\n\nI suspect your boyfriend's problem with Lila is that he's got a little crush.", "NTA. You made valid points.", "I don't think you owe him an apology. I get what you are saying here.", "NTA. He's a misogynist.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to show him that he is overlooking some of the same things that he is doing.  You were trying to show him that he needs to lay off her because he was being a hypocrite.  I really hope he isn't like this in other situations where he cannot acknowledge the error of his ways.  Have you asked him if he has any other reasons for his feelings about her? Could there be things he hasn't told you that his friend has mentioned?", "NTA.  Aiden\u2019s got some hangups.

Gaslighting is \" a form of psychological manipulation in which the abuser attempts to sow self-doubt and confusion in their victim's mind.\" It's a mild form of gaslighting, but Aiden is still causing OP self-doubt by trying to convince her that she called him a gold-digger, and OP is now even considering giving him an apology. It's not as bad as a lot of gaslighting examples, but it still counts", "Yeah, the whole thing was setting off red flags.

His years of being an \u201coutcast\u201d grew into a hatred for people that were seen as \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201ccool\u201d.

This may be something related to trauma but it\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m sure he hated being judged for being an \u201coutcast\u201d so it\u2019s wrong to do the same to someone else because he doesn\u2019t understand it or has misconceptions about her. It\u2019s a toxic unhealthy mentality he needs to get over. His feelings toward Lila could also mean he\u2019s scared she\u2019ll change Daniel to be more \u201cnormal\u201d and he\u2019ll adopt those traits and friends and he\u2019ll be the only \u201coutcast\u201d left. \n\nYou really need to have a sit down with him about this. He needs therapy regardless of which reason it is. Even if it\u2019s neither which I doubt, that level of disdain is coming from some kind of trauma response. I\u2019d also remind him that romantic is love is different than their kind of love, and Lila being in Daniel\u2019s life doesn\u2019t make him unimportant. That being said if he keeps pushing distance between him and Lila because of whatever weird shit is going on it WILL cause problems with Daniel and with Aiden being the perpetrator of that situation and Lila the victim, he\u2019ll likely chose Lila.", "The only difference here would be that it's her parents money , not hers.

Daniel is currently making more than Aiden so when HE got the popular girl, it HAAAAAAD to be the money \ud83d\ude12\n\nAt the end of the day, there are men who love gold diggers. Even if she WAS, it\u2019s not Aiden\u2019s gold being dug & Daniel doesn\u2019t seem to mind, so why does he even care?!?! \n\nNTA.", "Sounds an awful lot like Aiden is projecting his own insecurities on Lila and got upset that you called out his double standard.  I hope the guy gets the help he needs, or learns to help himself, to get out of whatever rut he seems to be in.  You're definitely NTA, and there's a deeper problem here that requires a conversation with your boyfriend before rifts start opening up as a result.  (source: my own life experience)", "NTA. He's gaslighting you.", "NTA", "NTA but kinda shitty. When someone's angry and ranting, reason won't work. Let them get it out, prevent any bad decisions, then get to the root of things. If he hates Lila, just ask him for the truth. Keep digging enough and you'll find it.", "NTA", "Your bf is into her.", "NTA. But your bf is jelous.", "NTA\n\nHe didn\u2019t like when the mirror turned in his direction. Truth hurts.", "NTA. He only got mad because you called him out and he knows you\u2019re correct.", "NTA - it sounds like he\u2019s more motivated by misogyny than intelligence", "Nta but my husband would be so proud of you lol. He loves it when I fight back with him (debate wise) and I can use his own words against him. It frustrates him because I'm right and he even tells me he has no legs to stand on.", "I think an important distinction is whether the gf is the one making the dude or pushing the dude to do it... Just going along on a trip with someone else paying doesn't make one a gold digger.", "NTA. Also get a new bf.", "NTA. Sometimes the ugliest thing to look at is a mirror.", "NTA, you are never an AH for pointing out someone being a hypocrite. He needs to grow up and learn to deal with inconsistencies in his views like a mature adult.\n\nIt is also very clear he dislikes her because he views her as a threat to the friendship, even if she ain\u2019t.", "NTA He has a weird obsession with his friend\u2019s relationship and he needs to step back and start staying in his own lane. On another note: why is it ok for him to dish it, but god forbid you call out his hypocrisy.", "NYA.\nSounds like Aiden has a thing for Lila.\nSorry OP \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA, he is jealous of the gf.", "NTA. Is he jealous?", "Just tell him the truth: you didn\u2019t call him a gold digger, just a hypocrite.\n\nIn all seriousness, there are a lot of red flags here. Jumping straight to her being a gold digger because she had one trip paid for is straight up misogynistic, not being able to see his hypocrisy is worrisome for similar disagreements in the future, and immediately switching to playing the victim when you surround him with facts\u2026\n\nIs this really someone you want to be with? You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. \u201cHey this person is horrible because X\u201d \u201cwe\u2019ll you\u2019ve also done X, so I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re horrible\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re saying I\u2019m horrible? You\u2019re hurtful and offensive\u201d\n\nI genuinely hope that once things calmed down he apologized and came around to see your point. Anything less would be a dealbreaker for me personally.\n\nNTA", "Definitely NTA, it sounds like maybe your boyfriend is a little jealous? But also he\u2019s just unreasonable. 15+ vacations that he went on with your family? He really shouldn\u2019t be saying anything at all. You\u2019re NTA, he should dig deep and figure out why he\u2019s really bothered by it. Does he want to be the one Daniel takes on vacation?", "That first part you mentioned caught my eye too. Like, sir, have you tried getting over yourself? Dude sounds way over the top and self centered with multiple things. OP is NTA", "So did you insult or thank the autocorrect??", "I\u2019m sure he is terrified that he is going to loose his (seems like his only) friend, now his only coping mechanism is to rant and find fault with his girlfriend. Imagine what his reaction would be if he finds another guy friend", "Or just hear me out it could be he's feeling jealous of Lila not because he has a crush on Daniel but because he feels left out and like he is losing his best/only friend", "NTA. Aiden is reaching dizzying new heights of irrationality on this one. Good luck with him, hopefully he grows out of his current mindset.", "Gold digger say what \ud83d\ude02 dude just exposed himself", "I've taken my partner on a few vacations because they're unable to work full time like I do. I bring them because I would rather experience things with them than alone. I think this is entirely normal. And you're NTA.", "NTA Sounds like Aiden is in love with his best friend", "NTA, but you should take notice of how he is behaving and treating others right now; it's only a matter of time before you encounter the whiny, sexist hypocrisy. \n\n# As the great Maya Angelou said: *'When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.'*\n\nLearn from this because it doesn't seem like he has.", "Nta, he just doesn't like her and is looking for a reason to validate his dislike, even unreasonable ones, and irritated when his argument gets picked apart so he becomes defensive and attacks to distract from the fact that his argument was invalid to begin with.", "NTA. It\u2019s ok when he does something but not her. He\u2019s a hypocrite", "Well as THE MAIN CHARACTER in both OP and Daniels life, surely everything he gets is only his just dues. How dare Lila try to take time, energy and money from Daniel that should be headed his way!\n\n/s", "I think you're right. I've seen this dynamic play out with male friends before and it isn't sexual. Sis straight men aren't exactly raised to engage with their feelings well or understand them thoroughly. He probably is used to be the most important person in his best friend's life and hes it is very specific way as a duo. Lila, and everything she represents in his mind threatens to upend his worldview.\n\nOP called him out in a very calm and logical way and he lost his mind. Jealousy is rarely completely logical. And I don't blame him for feeling it even though it's a logical, we can't help what we feel. But we can help how we act and it says a lot that not only is he being a jerk about this woman but he is trying to make a misogynistic trope out her for no reason other than she's happy and well-adjusted.", "I wouldn't call it being snobby, but more like pre-rejecting people who fit certain criteria (popular, bubbly, materialistic, etc), to defend your ego against being rejected. \n\nRemember, if you attack a person before they \"attack\" you, you won't get slapped by the pain of rejection. \n\nOPs description sounds like a cognitive schema built on numerous negative experiences in childhood and teenage years - being not one of the \"popular kids\" and treated in certain ways. \n\nWhat's insidious about these schemas, is that they guide what you see about people and situations, and fit everything that comes in that aimed framework. \n\nI don't think we'll get an update, but my bet is on Aiden keeping his pattern and failing to learn from criticism.", "More likely people associate intelligence with the kind of clever things they know. So they think people whove made the same choices are intelligent. \n\nThis CAN present as sexism or misogyny but it also can present as just looking down on every profession that doesnt use the same skills. \n\nAs an easy example for me, im an accountant and ive seen electricians look downon accountants because they took an easy job where they dont create anything even though they need them to make sense of what theyre doing. And ive seen accountants look down on electricians becaude theyre blue collar workers who are working with their hands even though they need them to complete stuff in their house/office. \n\nIts a whole my clan/your clan thing.", "NTA\n\nBut, take a hard look at this guy who feels it's perfectly fine to casually throw around the word 'gold digger'. If he's using that word on Lila, he's definitely THINKING about it with regards to you as well. Right now, you're probably measuring up as 'not a gold digger' in his head. BUT, considering the arbitrary nature of his 'judgement' it's only a matter of time before you 'slip' and become his definition of a gold digger too.\n\nAlso, words like gold digger are not only huge red flags for misogyny, but they're also a pretty solid indicator that he's slipping into the more toxic areas of the 'internet manosphere' like red pill and the like. Be very careful when you break up with this one.", "Not only a gold-digger but also childish as hell. NTA", "NTA. He should remove the log in his eye before looking at the speck in other's. He did exactly what lila is doing. I guess it is different from lila because she is a female and he is male. Typical double standards when it comes to gender. Men and women do the same thing and women are judged harshly. An aggressive woman at work is emotional and bitchy but a man is driven"]}
