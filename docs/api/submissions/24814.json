She\u2019d say too many carbs and then be elbow deep in our snacks 5 mins later haha", "I remember that post. The audience was very riled up over that one LOL", "That\u2019s ridiculous. I have a thing like that but it\u2019s funny. My boyfriend and I are drinkers, we love our vodka. Whenever I\u2019d grab the bottle and start opening my soda chaser, he\u2019d take the bottle and get his drink first. He would do it like EVERY time. Last week he went to do that and I gripped it between my knees and told him no way, not this time, you always do that. He started busting up laughing, I guess he\u2019d been doing it deliberately to see how long it would take me to notice or react lol. That\u2019s just who gets a shot first, not going out of his way to steal and/or ruin my shit. The post you spoke of, the cupcakes especially, duuuude. I\u2019d have made her remake them, straight up.", "Didn\u2019t she try to claim it was either a family tradition or just something that EVERYBODY did as a cultural thing? I seem to recall thinking it was something she saw her mom do to her dad\u2019s food and grew up thinking it was just a common thing.", "I remember that one. That girl was crazy pants!!", "If you can find that one again I\u2019d love to give it a read! I tried searching but came up empty handed", "What the hell. How do people become so entitled and oblivious to other people.", "This is exactly what my husband would say \ud83e\udd23", "I never said it was ok but it\u2019s like Pringles .. you can\u2019t stop once you start", "Getting into the real issues in this reddit thread.", "But they were perfect?! lol I haven't had mcdonald's fries on forever but i love this post.", "This.\n\nTo me it seemed indicative of something bigger than just a snack. Like, my stuff is my stuff but your stuff is also my stuff...", "I think it absolutely depends on her intent. Does she just mean it as \"I'm your partner and we share\" and maybe she'd have no problem if he did the same thing? \n\nLike, maybe in her mind \"I got a sundae and you got fries and we can share together\"\n\nMight just need a convo from OP like \n\n\"I just got fries and wanted my snack to myself and if you said you'd nab a few, I'd have ordered a bigger one\"", "This post is supposed to be somewhat whimsical. I think others can relate to my situation.", "That's a cute thing between your bf and you. It is liked by both of you and also enjoyed. It's consensual, and you are having fun doing it ! No one seemed annoyed by it.", "I think she said it was NORMAL and a sign of LOVE for a couple to do. I remember something about culture too.", "My dad used to take bites off my moms plate. Sometimes she\u2019d be saving \u201cthe perfect bite\u201d for last and he\u2019d steal it. I\u2019m surprised it took her as long as it did to divorce him lol. He is so selfish in many ways. I\u2019ll share my food but the person has to ask first or I get really defensive haha", "Totally, didn't she 6 deep mental issues, tho. Something regarding food?", "Ever had a perfect batch of McD's fries?  Wouldn't be surprised if they started a war.", "According to the post, they were.", "Exactly my thoughts. It's more than just being entitled to his food. It's kinda of power play.", "LOL, cool story, bro.", "There's at least 1 AITA post a day about food or at least it feels that way \ud83d\ude09", "Agreed. The moment someone says \"stop\", you stop. That's life and Y T A if you don't stop"]}
