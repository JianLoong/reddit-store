{"id": 25120, "submission_id": "15wk9bc", "title": "AITA for leaving my wife at a party/going away solo when she was making me late?", "selftext": "throwaway\n\nMy (28) wife (27) graduated medical school in 2021. They had a graduation party since everyone was vaccinated, but it was pretty small due to a recent outbreak there. You could only bring 1 guest and you had to socially distance again.  \nHer medical school decided to invite the pandemic graduates to this years graduation event. They planned this all out pretty last minute, only giving 3 weeks notice that it was happening. But my wife was very excited about it. She gets paid crumbs and works long hours as a resident, so I get why she wanted to relax and have fun.  \nThe issue is that I had a huge work trip the next day, that had been planned for months. I don't travel a lot for work so they went all out to make this comfortable, and I had a lot riding on it (if I didn't do well I would probably be fired, but if I did well there were 2 open positions I could be promoted to). My wife wanted to come with me, so my company comp'd her flight and we were going to make a vacation out of it after my presentations. We were flying out the night of the party to ensure I made it on time for the meetings the next day. I told my wife we shouldn't go to the re-do event since we had to fly out and it would be very tight.  \nShe insisted we go, since the party started at 3pm and our flight left at 9pm. But the gala was 1.5 hours away from the airport. We made a plan to leave at 5:30pm, pack everything in our car beforehand, so we could go straight to the airport.  \nBut by 530 she just started saying goodbye. I told her we needed to leave ASAP but she said no, we don't have to be 2 hours early for our flight, etc. Around 6pm this guy from med school (who had a crush and asked her out multiple times) grabbed her hand and pulled her to another table. I went up to them and told him he needed to back off. He said I needed to treat her better and let her 'enjoy herself'. I looked at my wife, but she ignored me.  \nAt that point I decided I wasn't going to try and convince her to stick to her word anymore. I told her I was leaving for the airport and took our car. There was a ton of traffic and security was a mess, so I only had a few minutes to spare before getting on the plane.  \nShe texted me horrible things. I never responded/engaged.  But she kept texting me how I was horrible and don't understand what it's like to have COVID ruin a huge moment for you. I disagree...she still had a graduation party, it's not my fault she didn't get to dance? I don't see what the huge deal was and conversely think she didn't understand that this would cost me my job if I missed the flight. And since I make up around 70% of our income in a HCOL area, we would essentially be homeless.  \nWe've been on tense terms since this happened in June. She brings it up a lot and is recommending therapy so I can \"learn how to behave in a marriage\", but I don't think we need it since she's the one who caused this whole problem in the first place and should take accountability for that first.  \nBut am I way off here?

If it's habitual, I'd leave. If this is the first time, do marriage counseling to see if having a third party back you up gets through to her.", "NTA.

If not, I don't understand why you stay with her.", "NTA\n\nIf my spouse had almost sabotaged my career and blamed me for their juvenile desire to party instead of stick to a pre-approved plan, I would end my marriage. Her behaviour and insistence that you are in the wrong are despicable. Is this the way you want your wife to behave in your marriage? Like necessities such as *your job* are second to her fleeting wants to dance? What happens next time she pulls this crap?\n\nEdit - I just realised your wife had money spent on her by your job that she squandered by not coming on the trip. How did your bosses react to her disrespect? They won't forget she did this, and they will act accordingly in the future.", "NTA. You told her you were leaving for the airport, she didn't respond and didn't come? You guys also made detailed plans about when to leave and why.\n\nYour work trip is financially important and if you do end up going to therapy together, you'll probably find that your side gets more support than you're expecting.\n\nShe was also pretty disrespectful by ignoring you when some dude made snide comments about how you treat your wife.

If you want to continue being married to her this needs to be dealt with, or you both will let the resentment build. Do you know what happened after you left, how did your wife handle you leaving her? I hope she didn't do anything in anger that she can't take back, but it is obvious that you two can't communicate with each other and need some help in that regard.", "NTA\n\nYou have established *beforehand* when you would leave.\n\nShe didn't leave on time.\n\nShe let a dude who had a crush on her interfere with the pre-established plans.\n\nShe would have made you both miss the flight, and you would have probably lost your job.\n\nYour wife is an AH. I wouldn't want her to be my doctor if she acts like that.", "NTA, 2 hours is cutting it close for a flight and she thought you had plenty of time to spare?", "Nta.

Sorry but your wife was and is acting like a spoiled child. She probably hooked up with the guy from med school as well. There is little doubt he was in her ear the whole time about the way you were mistreating her and feeding her drinks. BTW. Did you get the promotion?", "NTA but maybe therapy will actually have her understand her own emotions. You can bring up your side and the therapist might be able to communicate to her how you feel so she understands, that being late will adversely affect both of you as you are in a partnership.

It definitely seems like it\u2019s causing stress in your relationship.", "NTA she is immature and needs to grow up and realize the responsibilities of a job. And not risk her husbands job over a dance. If she knew beforehand that she wanted this she should have told you and made arrangements to solve it like an adult.", "NTA.\n\nI mean I know it's flippant to just say \"divorce\", but to me, this wouldn't be about the flight, but about the blatant disregard for something very important to you, and that was agreed on. I would be humiliated with work too that they paid for her flight and she didn't bother going. And then she ***doubled down***, and instead of apologising, is still saying this is your fault?\n\nMaybe there are some details you are not sharing here, but if what you describe is accurate, I would walk away from the relationship. The blatant disregard for your needs is the aspect that would make me end the marriage.\n\nI would go to couples counselling and explain all of the above, with a mediator.

I'd be re-thinking the whole relationship TBH.", "Did he get the promotion", "NTA. You compromised by going to the party, with the agreement that you'd leave on time.

You only had minutes to spare, so if you would have waited any longer, you obviously would have missed the flight.  You told her you were leaving, and then what happened?

But I also have some HUUUUUGE questions. Because there are things here that don't make sense. For example, You went to the airport and got on a plane without your wife.

Ya'll're 27/28? Sounds like you both needed your events, & didn't want to say no or couldn't think of anything besides \"do all the things/do none of the things.\" Ex: you could've left that night, she could've joined you after your mtg. Then you'd get to focus and she'd get the party/celebration she wanted/needed. Both needs are valid, but you can't always do it all. \n\nAlso - for ppl saying she's selfish or immature - she was in college, straight thru, for how long? And right into residency? That 1) is exhausting and 2) doesn't give time for real-world social development that other jobs might (truly not a diss, but just different experience, you could say). So, I mean, maybe, but if so it's a valid place to be, in that way.\n\ntl;dr sounds like you wanted to do all the things together, and have each get what they wanted/needed (which is good) - but the time/space continuum will not be ignored.

The clock hits 6, wife is flirting with another man. OP leaves.\n\nHow was OP not clearly communicating here? His wife is a doctor so she should understand schedules. She agreed to a plan then fucked it up.", "It is a warning if he waited for her to catch up. But he doesn't say that.", "Not sticking up for her. ESH means they're both AHs. Also OP is refusing marriage counselling which is clearly in need for their relationship."]}
