But it doesn\u2019t really sound like she is bugging you about it, she just invited you all. I\u2019m sure she has always wished her family could visit her where she lives regardless of the shower. Honestly it seems like you just need to decide how close you want to be with your sister. If you aren\u2019t really interested in cultivating a close relationship it makes sense why you wouldn\u2019t want to spend the money and time to travel there.
