We have always said we wanted a wedding in October because we are both wh*res for fall. We found a venue and were looking at potential dates (basically choosing which Saturday), they only had openings 3 out of the 4 Saturdays in October. We were between the 2nd and 3rd week, so we asked the venue coordinator what he recommended. He said the \u201cpeak\u201d weekend for the flowers (the venue is a garden) would be the 3rd weekend of October, so that\u2019s the one we went with. We let my family know via group chat that we had a date, and we put a payment down that day. My sister in law (44F) says \u201chey, that\u2019s on my birthday!\u201d And I thought, \u201coh, that\u2019s funny!\u201d And that was it, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, my mom (64F) says she got a call from my brother (43M) that my SIL was upset that we were moving forward with our wedding on her birthday.  She said she was most upset that my fianc\u00e9 and I would share our anniversary with her birthday in the following years, rather than upset she\u2019d have to spend a birthday at our wedding. She said, \u201cin our family, birthdays are a big deal.\u201d\n\nWhat really pissed me off was that she said \u201cyou\u2019re choosing between a human and some leaves\u201d (she\u2019s had 3 weddings - she knows how much of a headache finding a venue is)\n\nAt this point she is expecting us to change the date to the other available weekend. Typically, I would. However, my SIL has made a pattern out of this. Anytime someone celebrates something, she conveniently becomes ill or something happens where the attention becomes all about her. When I got pregnant, she stopped talking to me for a year because she was struggling with infertility. And I had to be the one to \u201cmend the bridge\u201d (to a fight I never started!). I don\u2019t want to enable this behavior by accommodating what I would say is unreasonable expectations. I don\u2019t want my entire wedding to become accommodating her. \n\nAnd before you ask about my brother, he has codependency issues and will never push back against her, so she essentially runs the relationship and my brother follows. \n\nTLDR; will I be the ahole if I don\u2019t change my wedding date from my SIL\u2019s birthday to the week before, even if I was able to?\n\nINFO: I did not realize the date we chose was her birthday until when she told us afterwards.

A) despite the fact that my brother had been married to his wife for 2 years, we had no idea when her birthday was and B) they never would have asked us to change our wedding date. Why? Because NO ONE sits down with a calendar to pick a wedding date to make sure it doesn't fall on a potential wedding guest's birthday!\nFrom the beginning of this post it was obvious the SIL is the jerk even without the added info about her SIL's drama. The SIL can decide not to attend, celebrate another day, or to celebrate before the wedding.  Normal sane people don't lose their crap because their birthday coincides with someone's wedding day.  Normal, sane people hear that and say, \"hey, that's on my birthday. Cool!\"\n\nKeep your wedding date.

There's just too much of a possibility for future conflict for my liking. In 5 years, she'll be turning 50, and you'll have your 5 year wedding anniversary. Both are milestones. It's a huge possibility for conflict if she wants to have a 50th birthday celebration with all of her family, but of course, you'll want to be doing something for your anniversary.
