We have always said we wanted a wedding in October because we are both wh*res for fall. We found a venue and were looking at potential dates (basically choosing which Saturday), they only had openings 3 out of the 4 Saturdays in October. We were between the 2nd and 3rd week, so we asked the venue coordinator what he recommended. He said the \u201cpeak\u201d weekend for the flowers (the venue is a garden) would be the 3rd weekend of October, so that\u2019s the one we went with. We let my family know via group chat that we had a date, and we put a payment down that day. My sister in law (44F) says \u201chey, that\u2019s on my birthday!\u201d And I thought, \u201coh, that\u2019s funny!\u201d And that was it, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, my mom (64F) says she got a call from my brother (43M) that my SIL was upset that we were moving forward with our wedding on her birthday.  She said she was most upset that my fianc\u00e9 and I would share our anniversary with her birthday in the following years, rather than upset she\u2019d have to spend a birthday at our wedding. She said, \u201cin our family, birthdays are a big deal.\u201d\n\nWhat really pissed me off was that she said \u201cyou\u2019re choosing between a human and some leaves\u201d (she\u2019s had 3 weddings - she knows how much of a headache finding a venue is)\n\nAt this point she is expecting us to change the date to the other available weekend. Typically, I would. However, my SIL has made a pattern out of this. Anytime someone celebrates something, she conveniently becomes ill or something happens where the attention becomes all about her. When I got pregnant, she stopped talking to me for a year because she was struggling with infertility. And I had to be the one to \u201cmend the bridge\u201d (to a fight I never started!). I don\u2019t want to enable this behavior by accommodating what I would say is unreasonable expectations. I don\u2019t want my entire wedding to become accommodating her. \n\nAnd before you ask about my brother, he has codependency issues and will never push back against her, so she essentially runs the relationship and my brother follows. \n\nTLDR; will I be the ahole if I don\u2019t change my wedding date from my SIL\u2019s birthday to the week before, even if I was able to?\n\nINFO: I did not realize the date we chose was her birthday until when she told us afterwards.

The SIL can decide not to attend, celebrate another day, or to celebrate before the wedding.  Normal sane people don't lose their crap because their birthday coincides with someone's wedding day.  Normal, sane people hear that and say, \"hey, that's on my birthday. Cool!\"\n\nKeep your wedding date.

We\u2019ve known a few tidbits about her provided by OP and we could have seen this would be an issue coming a mile away. She should have just gone on a subreddit for complaining about AH in laws.  It\u2019s the feigning surprise and the defensive comments further explaining distaste for the SIL that made me call her out as a pot-stirrer. NOT a full blown AH, mind you. \n\nWe are in a subreddit dedicated to dissecting situations about whether or not someone did an AH thing, right? It\u2019s not called \u201cSomeone was an AH to me, do I have a right to be upset?\u201d I thought I was adding to the discourse.", "To be fair, it seems that she was following the advice given to people struggling with infertility, which is to remove yourself from the situation and if need be step back from relationships with people who might trigger you e.g pregnant family members.\n\n\nWhat she said is vile and awful, so she's definitely the AH there. But cutting you off while you were pregnant and new mother is likely more for her self preservation then about you and she doesn't owe you anything for that.", "And you shouldn\u2019t, that\u2019s so gross of her to use those words to describe you simply having a baby. But she sounds absolutely sad and miserable, you don\u2019t have to one-up her. I\u2019m honestly curious why birthdays are such a big deal to her because it doesn\u2019t seem like she has real support from her family since she\u2019s desperately seeking it from you and your brother\u2019s side.", "Trust me, it comes across loud and clear that you all don\u2019t like her.  I get it. You\u2019re totally entitled to that and not liking someone doesn\u2019t make you an AH. But her having feelings also doesn\u2019t make her an AH. How people react is a different story.", "You have such bad faith in me. And it\u2019s interesting to see how some people cling to my information and call it \u201cdefensive\u201d when really, I\u2019m correcting false assumptions (made by you and others) on a topic I\u2019d really like clarity on. Not everyone is gonna agree who the AH is and sure I may seem spiteful because I have a mountain of experience with this person and frankly yes, she\u2019s exhausting. The only reason I tolerate her at this point is because I love my brother. I wasn\u2019t feigning surprise that she was upset - I knew she was a drama queen, but yes, me and my whole family were surprised that she had the gonads to tell us with a straight face \u201cit hurts my feelings that your wedding is on my birthday\u201d because none of us found that as a reasonable excuse to reschedule the wedding. Especially for a woman 17 years my senior.", "No, she doesn\u2019t owe me. But if I had to make a very abrupt change like that to a relationship I cared about, I\u2019d at least let them know that it\u2019s happening and why. And I wouldn\u2019t use their brother as a hostage in the situation.", "Dude yeah. Also, she has no relationship with her dad and a nearly-estranged relationship with her mom.", "No one said her having a feeling made her a potential AH.", "Would you? I don't know. People struggling with infertility are hurting and I think people do weird things when they're hurting to self soothe.\n\n\n>And I wouldn\u2019t use their brother as a hostage in the situation.\n\n\nIt's his infertility too. Maybe the distance was a mutual choice by them as a couple? Maybe he decided he needed to support his struggling wife? Maybe he found it a difficult experience himself?\n\nHonestly, I don't want to defend her. She sounds like a lot and it definitely sounds like there is a lot of history between your family and her. But I did want to defend people in similar situations who step away from triggering relationships in order to preserve their own mental health. I'd let it go, you got to be a mother and have a baby and she is deeply unhappy without either.", "So consider this- she has no one to really celebrate her bday with except her husband, she wanted you all to join her last year and can tell she annoys everyone, and you just ensured that you and your husband will NEVER celebrate a birthday with her, because it will always be your anniversary. Not your problem, but it sounds lonely AF. I think she\u2019s trying to create a redo family, is failing, and I would guess that probably throwing a tantrum was the only way to get listened to as a kid based on her behavior now.", "She has 3 children already.", "You\u2019re making yet another assumption - none of us ever show her that we\u2019re annoyed with her (except my senior citizen dad). We have bent over backwards for her, so yeah, this feels like it could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back when it comes to our patience with her. She\u2019s a middle aged woman - this is not acceptable behavior. And that\u2019s from someone still in their 20s", "I've had many friends marry on my birthday or birthday weekend. Which is in October lol\n\nAnd my attitude was ooo a party I don't have to pay for and cake! Sign me up!\n\nNTA and congrats", "NTA. She can stay home.", "The only way YWBTA is if you cave to her demand.\n\n1. Birthdays are for children. \n\n2. No date belongs to anyone just cos they were born then. Just ask all those born on Christmas day.\n\nTo borrow that favourite reddit quote I would say to her. \"This is the date wedding is on. Your invitation is not a summons if you don't want to then don't come.\" In all honesty sounds like it would be better if she isn't there.", "Oh man, are you my sister? My FBIL's sister basically said she was going to disown her brother because the date they picked for the wedding is on her birthday, because it was the only day in the season they wanted at a venue that worked for them. Now mind you, said FSIL lives in San Francisco, so even IF the date was moved, it's not like things would make any difference as far as people showing up.", "NTA. Only the couple getting married gets to dictate something as important as that. You can\u2019t please everyone. She sounds like she would hate the other weekend because the trees will be orange but not red that weekend.", "NTA, she has no say in this. If she doesn't like it, she doesn't have to attend, doing you a big favor anyways \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA. Don\u2019t invite your bro or his wife they\u2019ll just ruin your day.", "If she\u2019s the type to want to steal the spotlight, I\u2019d be prepared for how you\u2019ll deal with it if she comes and then makes a big effort to get everyone to sing Happy Birthday to her in the middle of your reception. Will she spend the whole event pointing it out to everyone? \n\nNTA, but it might be worth thinking hard about what sort of behavior she\u2019d stoop to, and considering changing things if you think she\u2019ll use this on the day to pull focus and you hate the idea of dealing with that. It stinks to even consider giving in to her, so seriously discuss having a friend who can be assigned to divert her or a strategy for keeping her on the sidelines.", "NTA.  Lots of things can coexist with birthdays.  I share one with my cousin, also an aunt and uncle's wedding anniversary.  SIL is being ridiculous about this!", "NTA. Tell her that her *next* wedding can be on *your* birthday.", "If someone booked their wedding on my birthday I'd tell them what a great day they picked and that I demanded a birthday hug at the party.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She sounds like a drama queen. What is she going to do if you get pregnant & your child is born on her bithday? Demand that the doctors put the baby back in because she doesn't want anyone to share her birthday? Enjoy your wedding and don't invite her.", "We got married on my SIL\u2019s birthday (also didn\u2019t realise), which is also our shared other SIL\u2019s wedding anniversary. Makes for great celebrations. I\u2019m constantly astounded at people who think any one day (or G-d forbid, a week or month or year) should be set aside for them and them alone. NTA but SIL sounds insufferable. I\u2019d suggest a special iced birthday cake at your wedding, with a few extra years tacked on for good measure.", "NTA - though would caution you if SIL has a tendency to make things about her you may want to just consider a different date or ways to keep her at arm's length to mitigate her a$$holyness to ensure she doesn't intentionally sabotage your day.........", "NTA it was two of my guests birthdays at my wedding so we got gifts for both if them and thanked them for sharing in our day.", "NTA, next time she mentions it, just sweetly tell her that you\u2019ll miss her presence at your wedding.", "NTA don\u2019t change the date.\n\nMake a faux show of her birthday at the event. Thinking gaudy flowers given to her on the day, a balloon, huge light up badge with her birthday age.  Get the bridesmaids and page boys sing happy birthday to her, and a child\u2019s birthday cake etc\n\nAn Autumn wedding sounds blissful.  My Grandparents were winter fans and got married on Christmas Day with snow around the churchyard and everyone wrapped up in stylish coats.", "NTA.  OP, it sounds like your sister in law is a classic narcissist.", "Wheel out a grocery store ice cream cake next to the big wedding cake.", "She sounds like she'll be getting married a fourth time eventually and OP won't have to worry about her ever again.", "My brother married a woman whose first name is the same as mine, and she took his surname so we both have the same name. I always tell people he married her to annoy me.", "Yeah I wouldn't want to spend any of my anniversaries with my SIL", "I got married on my dad's birthday. During our father/daughter dance, he said it was the best birthday he ever had.", "We did a courthouse wedding on a Friday and a reception/ party on the next day. MIL' s birthday.

You\u2019re not close enough to have remembered it was her birthday when booking the wedding. If she doesn\u2019t want to spend her birthday at a wedding, and has explicitly said this, don\u2019t invite her. There would be drama if she was invited, by your own account. So spare yourselves. If she\u2019s been married three times already, it\u2019s not likely you\u2019ll have to put up with her forever. Tell your family that you don\u2019t want to hear any third party reports of how sad SIL is. If they want to enable her nonsense, they can listen to her. You don\u2019t have to.\n\nI hope you have a long and happy marriage and a lovely wedding.", "I wonder if the SIL is more upset because she\u2019d want to have a big birthday bash where she\u2019s the center of attention. But OP having an anniversary on that day (even if OP isn\u2019t even there) takes away from her being the center of attention", "My thought is that if you didn't know her birthday when you set the date -- how much of a big deal can it have been so far? I mean, if you'd been going to a big birthday bash for her every year, you would have known about the conflict. Of course, I'm sure she'll try to make you make a fuss over her birthday from now on, but how awesome that you'll have an anniversary dinner or out-of-town trip as an excuse not to go? \n\nNTA. Your SIL is controlling. No one can rescue your brother except him. It sucks, but you can't change it.", "That must be a wonderful memory", "He sounds like a fun person.  And I think I vibe with his outlook.  Frankly, if my brother got married on my birthday, my first thought would be, \"Well, neither of us has a valid excuse to forget the other's celebration date!\"\n\nI think it would be OK to share this type of special day.  The only time I would not want to share would be if my birthday was on Christmas.  Those kids always get shafted AF on presents.", "My dad's gone now - I cherish it.", "Not the point of this post, but as someone with a Christmas birthday, that's not always the case. We celebrated my birthday on the 26th and my parents were very clear to my family that birthday presents weren't to be wrapped in Christmas paper. Also, once I got older I started combining the two if I wanted something more expensive. \n\nAlso, my aunt thought it wasn't fair I only kinda got one day, so she would take out magazine subscriptions for me (I'm old lol) so that way I'd get a small present each month.", "Call him and lay all of this out.\n\nTell him you need to talk to your brother - not the mediator.
