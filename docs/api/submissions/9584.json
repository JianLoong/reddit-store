We have always said we wanted a wedding in October because we are both wh*res for fall. We found a venue and were looking at potential dates (basically choosing which Saturday), they only had openings 3 out of the 4 Saturdays in October. We were between the 2nd and 3rd week, so we asked the venue coordinator what he recommended. He said the \u201cpeak\u201d weekend for the flowers (the venue is a garden) would be the 3rd weekend of October, so that\u2019s the one we went with. We let my family know via group chat that we had a date, and we put a payment down that day. My sister in law (44F) (my brother\u2019s wife) says \u201chey, that\u2019s on my birthday!\u201d And I thought, \u201coh, that\u2019s funny!\u201d And that was it, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, my mom (64F) says she got a call from my brother (43M) that my SIL was upset that we were moving forward with our wedding on her birthday.  She said she was most upset that my fianc\u00e9 and I would share our anniversary with her birthday in the following years, rather than upset she\u2019d have to spend a birthday at our wedding. She said, \u201cin our family, birthdays are a big deal.\u201d\n\nWhat really pissed me off was that she said \u201cyou\u2019re choosing between a human and some leaves\u201d (she\u2019s had 3 weddings - she knows how much of a headache finding a venue is)\n\nAt this point she is expecting us to change the date to the other available weekend. Typically, I would. However, my SIL has made a pattern out of this. Anytime someone celebrates something, she conveniently becomes ill or something happens where the attention becomes all about her. When I got pregnant, she stopped talking to me for a year because she was struggling with infertility. And I had to be the one to \u201cmend the bridge\u201d (to a fight I never started!). I don\u2019t want to enable this behavior by accommodating what I would say is unreasonable expectations. I don\u2019t want my entire wedding to become accommodating her. \n\nAnd before you ask about my brother, he has codependency issues and will never push back against her, so she essentially runs the relationship and my brother follows. \n\nTLDR; will I be the ahole if I don\u2019t change my wedding date from my SIL\u2019s birthday to the week before, even if I was able to?\n\nINFO: I did not realize the date we chose was her birthday until when she told us afterwards.

The SIL can decide not to attend, celebrate another day, or to celebrate before the wedding.  Normal sane people don't lose their crap because their birthday coincides with someone's wedding day.  Normal, sane people hear that and say, \"hey, that's on my birthday. Cool!\"\n\nKeep your wedding date.

We\u2019ve known a few tidbits about her provided by OP and we could have seen this would be an issue coming a mile away. She should have just gone on a subreddit for complaining about AH in laws.

Not everyone is gonna agree who the AH is and sure I may seem spiteful because I have a mountain of experience with this person and frankly yes, she\u2019s exhausting. The only reason I tolerate her at this point is because I love my brother.

Also, she has no relationship with her dad and a nearly-estranged relationship with her mom.", "No one said her having a feeling made her a potential AH.", "Would you? I don't know.

Maybe the distance was a mutual choice by them as a couple? Maybe he decided he needed to support his struggling wife? Maybe he found it a difficult experience himself?\n\nHonestly, I don't want to defend her. She sounds like a lot and it definitely sounds like there is a lot of history between your family and her.

Ignore her needy nonsense and enjoy your wedding.", "Did this at my wedding but not for petty reasons. My best friends birthday was our wedding day. He was in the wedding party and didn't say word. We surprised him during the reception right before cake by bringing out a big bowl of his favorite dessert, banana pudding, from his favorite place and sang happy birthday to him. Its something we all think back kindly on, except for the wedding planner stealing his leftover pudding which is still angry about lol.", "My parents had their 40th anniversary last year. Their anniversary is in June and I got married in April (it means the year of their 50th will be mine and my husband\u2019s 10th, which is kind of fun). A month or two before my wedding, I texted my aunt (mom\u2019s sister) in a tizzy, saying I did not have the brain space to plan anything, but did she think my parents would want a big party? I didn\u2019t think they would (it\u2019s not really their style), but I didn\u2019t want them to think I had forgotten. If they wanted something, I would need my aunt to help. My aunt said she would find out (she said she would be subtle, but I found out from my mom months later that she had a few glasses of wine one night and basically blurted the whole thing out, lol). Turns out they didn\u2019t want a party and all was fine. My uncle and his wife had a milestone anniversary on or around my brother\u2019s wedding. They were more than happy to spend it celebrating a new marriage. This is how reasonable people act.", "I think that other poster even used the wording that birthdays are a big deal which is a bit of an interesting coincidence", "I don\u2019t think they\u2019d ever line up like that, thankfully! When we get married she\u2019ll be turning 46", "You should totally go ahead with the wedding date. If she's on her third wedding at age 44 there'll be a fourth not involving your actual family that you don't need to worry about.", "She\u2019s a narcissist of the highest degree", "The thing about anniversaries is that nobody but the couple really cares about them- maybe your parents and, 20+ years from now, your kids, but that's about it. It's hardly a problem to share one with a birthday or any other holiday.", "This is the part no one is paying attention to - the fact that she never came straight to me or my fianc\u00e9 about it.", "Please read the new edit on this thread", "Asking your vips if there are any conflicts on a proposed day is EXTREMELY common practice. Parents, grandparents, siblings, bridal party. It's not surveying the whole guest list, it's making sure the people most important to you can be there. As the wife of the brother, SIL's conflicts become the brothers conflicts. Whether a birthday counts as a legit conflict is debatable, but imo it is rude to schedule a date without checking with your vips first.", "YOu don't need to know how she feels. It is a date you want. If she doesn't like it, she can skip and sulk. \n\nDo not VALIDATE her and her \"emotions,\" she just wants to be right and have her way 100%.\n\nYou lives and SEPARATE from their lives, you don't have to do anything you don't want to do. She can shut up and mind her own business.", "Of course OP is NTA - my comment was response to another comment saying OP validates SIL\u2019feelings. She didn\u2019t.", "My youngest the day before his brother's BD. At the stroke of midnight, he had the band play Happy Birthday. It was pretty cool. The brother was very happy.", "It is in some places.  Where I live, one week is the difference between peek leaf foliage and leaves dying and falling off the trees. JS", "NTA. \n\nI personally would change the date just to avoid a conflict IF I could do so without losing my venue. To me, it reads like your SIL is going to make this a fight every year, and that's something I wholeheartedly would be trying to avoid like the plague. If I would lose my venue, I'd just tell her that I tried to change and couldn't. Get over it or don't. \n\nWith that being said, even if you don't try to change it (regardless of whether it can be done), you're still not in the wrong. It's your wedding date that was agreed upon by you and your SO. Plus, kinda weird for her to tattle to mommy instead of just talking to you about it.", "NTA! \n\n\u201cOh man, I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t realize that when I booked.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we understand it\u2019s just some leaves and two humans, so if you want to spend your birthday elsewhere we won\u2019t be offended.\u201d \n\u201cMan what a bummer. Should I still send an invite?\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s one day. She can put on her big girl panties and either politely decline to attend and celebrate her birthday, or she can come and celebrate YOUR day and celebrate her birthday another day. Not at your wedding.", "NTA.  Don't change your wedding date for her.  If you do that, you'll set a precedent where she'll demand you change something else.  God forbid you get pregnant again and your due date is on her birthday.  I bet she'd demand that you either get induced to have the baby early, or \"you have to hold that child in an extra couple of weeks, so we don't share *my* birthday!\"\n\nMy sister's rehearsal dinner was on our second cousin's birthday, she was turning 14 (she's now in her 20s).  When it came time for dessert, they wheeled out a special birthday cake for her and everyone sang \"Happy Birthday.\"  My second cousin wasn't upset that she had to have her birthday party on a different weekend because of my sister's wedding (she was a bridesmaid) and had told us to not do anything extra to acknowledge her birthday, so she was surprised by the birthday cake.  My second cousin was acting more like an adult than your SIL is, and she was *fourteen!*", "NTA. Go ahead with everything as planned. People like her need pushback from the real world to ground them... and your brother isn't going to do it. She needs to witness ppl not centering their world around them. Mute her however you want and enjoy your wedding.", "Birthdays are \"a very big deal\" in her family yet her own brother didn't even notice the matching date when scheduling his wedding.\n\nI'm guessing that SIL is a bit extra.\n\nNTA. Please don't change your wedding date for this monumentally self absorbed and boring person.", "Absolutely NTA. My husband and I are currently helping plan our friends wedding, which happens to fall on my husband's birthday. If you have any ounce of maturity you understand that birthdays come every year and wedding dates (hopefully) only happen once.", "NTA sounds like you'll have less people to pay for.", "NTA. This is - I\u2019m just going to say it - stupid and entitled. I\u2019d say she sounds like a toddler but that\u2019s insulting to toddlers", "NTA and your soon to be sister in law needs to f right off. No one has cirrected this behavior so she thinks its perfectly fine. Keep your date and just dont invite her. I am sorry that means your brother wont go but she is pull soemtbing at your wedding reguardless of the day its on.", "My SIL and BIL got married on my brothers birthday.   They had a special birthday cake for him and all the guests sung happy birthday to him.  He was thankful but not pleased!", "[removed]", "NTA. My parents got married on my uncle's birthday. A couple decades later a nephew was born also on that day. My father was coincidentally born on his parents' wedding anniversary. My birthday is three days away from a major holiday (typically celebrated through a weekend, so people nearly always have family/party plans). I don't think anyone has suffered some lasting trauma from sharing a birthday with another special event. If I do something for my birthday I pick a different weekend. One year out of 80ish your SIL spends her actual birthday at a party that isn't about her? Big deal. She needs to grow up.", "NTA ignore her.", "NTA\n\nIt's a birthday. It's not that big of a deal. I would never tell someone they couldn't get married on my birthday. Is such a weird thing to gatekeep.", "NTA. Seriously, I would expect a 5 year old to throw a temper tantrum about someone \u201cstealing\u201d their birthday, not a grown ass women in her mid-40s. SIL can fuck right off.", "She shared her feelings, you can share your feelings. Now that we're done with that, she can stfu.", "NTA however I find it weird that your fianc\u00e9 didn't remember it was his sister\u2019s birthday", "NTA, but the problem is the SIL is going to overtake your wedding and make every person know the day is HER BIRTHDAY. Get ready to hear her talk about it the whole time", "NTA.\n\nIgnore this woman. When her birthday is has absolutely nothing to do with when you should choose to pick your wedding.\n\nFrankly, unless it's 21 or 100 I can't figure out why any adult makes any big deal about a birthday whatsoever.", "NTA. My nephew was born on my anniversary, should I have told my sil to hold off another 24 hours so that I wouldn\u2019t have to share the date?  My parents got married on my cousins birthday.
