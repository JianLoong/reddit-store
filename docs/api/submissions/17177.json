Because of that I have more time I generally help my sister and brother in law out with the kids a lot. I\u2019ve even spent weeks living at their house helping with the kids.

My high school friend was getting married as well as my cousin. Each would have a celebration on Saturday and Sunday respectively. So we attended on Saturday with my sister and other family on at my cousin\u2019s wedding from the morning till late afternoon then I went with my friends to our friend\u2019s wedding in the evening. It was hectic but I managed. My sister did mention that she had a wedding out of state on Sunday but did not ask me to help with the kids. \n\nOn Sunday morning, as I was getting ready for my cousin\u2019s celebration (I planned to be there for three hours, then cross over to my friend\u2019s celebration at noon), my sister called me and asked that I go pick up the children and drop them off at my parents house then continue with my plans. She had already left them in the house and told them I would come for them. \n\nI told her I couldn\u2019t do it. My day was already jam packed and I was struggling to be present for both my cousin and friend on their special days. Adding a two hour return trip would not be possible. I suggested that she reach out to our parents as they would be free at 11am. She agreed and I didn\u2019t think about it again. \n\nShe now confronted me saying I truly hurt her feelings by refusing to take the kids and she always expects me to help when she needs it cause I\u2019m her only sister and should always be the first one to help. She also claims I put my friends and social events ahead of the kids who need me. \n\nI thought that that it\u2019s unfair to expect me to cancel my social engagements in order for her to attend hers.

They're not your kids and, presumably, your sister knew you had additional plans for the day.", "NTA.  \n\n\nYour sister seems to rely on you to care for the children at the level of co-parenting -- which means, they are your first priority, always.    \n\n\nWhile that may be a real thing in some situations, it's not in yours.   It's time to lay down some specific boundaries.", "NTA.  Those aren't your kids.  If your sister wants to guarantee your time she should pay you for it.  Otherwise the time you give is at your discretion you're her sister not her servant. She should be grateful you're helping at all.", "NTA.  It's unreasonable for your sister to think you're the on-call babysitter and housekeeper.  It doesn't matter that you don't have a job right now.  Time to set some boundaries.", "NTA  - 'YOU\" truly hurt her feelings?....entitlement at it's finest. Continue to remain true to your commitments.\n\nSet and keep clear boundaries. She focuses on guilting and disrespecting you.  Not a shred of gratitude was expressed in the past several years. Your willingness to accommodate may have brought out the worst in her but do not take responsibility for her negligent parenting and demeaning treatment of you. \n\nShe had both a live-in nanny and 'on demand' sitter who did not require a background check or compensation. The audacity of her behavior defines an ahole.  Continue to thrive. You matter regardless of the BS she dishes out.", "Katherine Heigl, is that you?\n\nBut seriously, NTA. \n\nIt sounds like you have been very kind and supportive. She shouldn't just assume and expect you to help. And she shouldn't leave her children unattended!", "NTA but at this point, it's fair to say she took you for granted, and was irresponsible in doing so. I get that you love the kids. But at this point, you may have to step back from being her go to for everything kid related.", "NTA. She should have planned in advance- asking someone to drop their plans to accommodate her lack of planning is totally inappropriate. Also, at 13 I was definitely babysitting other kids- why on earth couldn\u2019t they stay alone for a little while while she was gone?!\n\nYou are not their parent- and you should make it clear to your sister from now on you need at least 3 days advance notice (if not a week) to babysit. Expecting you to take responsibility for her kids is ridiculous.", "NTA at all.\n\nIf she wanted you to adjust your plans, she should have asked in advance. Surprising you with a request to add a two-hour errand into your busy day was a total AH thing for her to do.\n\nYou've apparently been to generous up until now, because she expects you to drop everything whenever she wants you to take care of her kids.\n\nThe fact that she would leave them alone at home prior to speaking to you says it all. She had no idea that you might refuse. She is taking advantage of you and took it for granted that your prior plans didn't matter.", "NTA. She already knew your schedule, told you hers and never asked for help (probably because you had JUST delineated explicitly why she would have been told NO can do) yet she needlessly and senselessly left them home, called you after the fact, and is mad you didn\u2019t derail your own plans to adjust for this?  Nope. Not even close. She could have skipped on whatever wedding she was going to.", "NTA 100% \n\nIt sounds like your sister believes she's entitled to your time. It's illegal to leave kids alone like that in most places, as well. She's risking a police call.", "NTA\n\nYour sister has started taking your help for granted. She is no longer making plans for childcare because she is assuming that you will take over whenever she needs it. While it's fine for you to be willing to help, you need to set some boundaries now that this is becoming an expectation rather than being seen as a favour. \n\nYour sister put her plans ahead of her kids and expected you to put her kids ahead of your plans. *Not Cool!* \n\nI'd suggest sitting down with her and letting her know what you are and are not willing to do and how much notice you require in future. Then let your parents know as well since they seem to think you don't have a life of your own.", "NTA.  Just apologize\u2026.I am sorry that you have grown to expect me to drop my plans to help with your children but this is my fault for not establishing boundaries.  From this point forward I will allow you and your husband to parent your own children.   I will step back from helping with the kids for one full month.  After that time we can go back to occasional pick ups of the kids in case of emergencies, but that is it.  You don\u2019t get to berate me or guilt me into helping.", "nta. i\u2019m curious; do you always expect your sister to help you? how often does she help you? how much of her time is spent helping you? how often does she cancel her own events so you can attend yours? food for thought. the answer will not change my judgement. she failed to plan ahead, she acted as if she was entitled to your time and effort. she is not. that is a gift you have given her in the past, and i would think twice about being so generous in the future.", "NTA.
