Clearly her love language is in giving things.  However, you are right.  If you and your husband can't remotely afford to give the kinds of gifts they can, it's not helping the kids at all.\n\nI would say she is not the AH --- except for the fact that you **told her** to cut down on it.  And she didn't listen.  That makes her the AH here.\n\nIf she wants to give money to your kids, maybe ask if she can put most of the money she'd spend on the gift into a college fund for the kids.  So she can still buy your kids things --- things that are on a par with what you could afford --- and benefit the kids' futures at the same time.", "NTA. It's a difficult situation but you did talk to your sister about it and she continued to do what she wanted. I her that it wasn't malicious but she still broke a boundary that you clearly set for her. You have nothing to apologise for.", "ESH. You failed to explain this well to your kids, and at the same time your sister had no intution and sense for your feelings and your situation. Not sure about this whole situation and if its even real, what sister would buy coats for her nieces that cost more than the rent, for a family thats on food stamps or just struggling?", "Single father here, with an 11yo son. Things are tight for me too. And I had similar issues with my ex-MIL. It\u2019s hard, I know. And you are definitely NTA. \n\nIt sounds like your sister is living vicariously through you with the kids. She wants to spoil them like they are her own, so understand that it\u2019s coming from a good place, a place of love. \n\nI don\u2019t know the exact conversation you had. And I know that you had to be firm, set the boundaries and tell her to stop breaking them\u2026 is it possible that\u2026 out of frustration and that feeling of inferiority\u2026 that you may have been a bit harsh this time? \n\nDo not apologize for setting boundaries, or being firm with a person who has a hard time accepting those boundaries\u2026 but if you look back at it with a clearer mind and realize that there was a more tactful way, then apologize for that\u2026 and explain that you were frustrated cause she hasn\u2019t listened to you in the past.", "NTA I get that she is trying to help out, but you have to parent them and you are trying to raise them to understand the financial reality that you live in and they are not learning the value of money if things are always given to them. I'd apologise for upsetting her but suggest things like her putting into a collage fund instead. Or how about taking them out somewhere and use the money to have a life  experience with them. It would be far more valuable than material junk.", ">She said she was disappointed in me and asked me to not disturb her wife anymore unless I apologised.\r  \n\r\n\nProblem solved - her wife (your sister) doesn't want any interaction with you unless she's allowed to buy your kids expensive gifts.\n\nCalmly explain to her wife that if she cannot simply enjoy family time, and has to make it about expensive gifts, then her choice to judge family time \"not worth the effort\" is regrettable but you accept it.\n\nNo, you're not the asshole. I am in this position with my nephew - I either don't buy anything or make the gift \"from everyone\". The fact I'm using my higher salary to buy things is completely invisible - I would *never* put parents in the position of your sister is placing you in.\n\nBut then again, I don't need children to specifically view me as \"better\" than their parents. That's the only motivation for her behavior, it's the only reason why it would be upsetting if she were deprived of the ability to attribute expensive gifts to herself.\n\nThe fact she has that unnatural need to be viewed as wealthy by children is not your fault, although she's sure making it your problem.", "NAH. Have you ever thought that giving is her love language? Also, have you ever thought that maybe she knows that you aren\u2019t as well off so she\u2019s spoiling your kids to spoil you? I lost my dog last year and got a new puppy, and last Christmas multiple people got me dog toys, treats, etc. I could have taken it as I wasn\u2019t being a good dog \u201cparent\u201d but figured they knew I was having a hard time and were covering the treats so I could cover the essentials. So, their plan was to take care of me. \nThat being said I could see where you might be a bit resentful, but you can absolutely teach the kids about how treats and special things are just that, special. And they wouldn\u2019t be as special if you have them every day. Maybe work with your sister on more reasonable expectations like seeing a movie or going out to eat instead of pricey items, or work with her to identify things that the kids would get the most use/enjoyment out of so she can still gift without making you feel like what you provide isn\u2019t good enough. But don\u2019t ice someone out who clearly cares about your kids.", ">My sister is a very sensitive  .. person\n\nOnly about her own emotions.  Where your emotions are concerned, she's as sensitive as a brick.\n\nNTA", "Honestly, I think it\u2019s making you feel inferior. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having a rich relative who is generous. In fact, it\u2019s better than one who doesn\u2019t do anything for their niblings. I can see that AITA now\u2026my sis is loaded and gives my kids cheap shit. \n\nYour kids are old enough to understand that Aunties don\u2019t have kids and love spoiling them every now and again, but they should realize that you don\u2019t have that kind of budget for luxury items, so they need to keep this in perspective and not demand things, even from Aunties. \n\nHow is this \u2018harmful\u2019 exactly? \n\nSorry but YTA.\n\nAnd also\u2026using your kids as leverage and threatening to cut her off in that slick way you did makes you the real ah here.", "Definitely NTA.", "YTA. Your sister wants to buy your kids expensive gifts they can\u2019t otherwise have, because she can, she enjoys it, and she thinks they do too. You threatened to cut her access to the kids if she didn\u2019t stop being generous to your kids. She apologized and said she\u2019ll stop. She was hurt by your threatening approach about not letting her spend time with them (which in my view clearly reflects your own insecurities about money). She agreed to your terms but was hurt and sad about what you said and how you said it, and she told her wife. Her wife thought surely you wouldn\u2019t have been so harsh with your sister if you knew you hurt her so much, so she told you that and asked you to apologize to your sister. Did I get that right?  How are you not TA?", "NTA. You could say that you're sorry she took your request as something hurtful, but it was a request you won't be backing down on because they're you're kids and it's YOU that has to cope with the fall-out.\n\nShe is literally trying to buy affection and maybe a bit of control over you, although I wouldn't say that. This never goes well. Tell her that giving gifts is lovely, and you appreciate it very much. But kids wreck things and fight over things and get jealous and expect the same again. So gifts should be cheap and cheerful unless you've sanctioned something bigger.", "YTA. I want to say you're not the asshole. I really do, but... You kinda are in this situation. I know it's hard, especially the kids behavior, but... Kids spend more time with you than they do their aunt. It's your responsibility to teach them that they don't always get what they want, and that their aunt getting them stuff is a special treat.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are overreacting, but understandably given the psychology of human beings, and weren't an ass. She just wants to share wealth with the family.\n\nI think it is harsh to deny your kids nice things because you are embarrassed about not being able to provide them, though; you should want your kids to have them. I would just explain the situation, and make them understand that the gifts you give them are smaller but full of love, that you won't always be able to get them big aunty's gifts, and that this is okay. Then just raise them with love; they'll understand, will get to enjoy expensive things, and your relationship as their parents will still be one of the strongest bonds.", "Teensy tiny YTA. When you sat down to draw that very reasonable boundary, which you had every right to draw, it doesn't look like there was any acknowledgment on your part of her kindness, thoughtfulness or generosity. After all, it seems she was spoiling your kids out of love. Her intentions were good, even if the result was not.\n\nUnfortunately your approach acted like she was doing something malicious and took her to task, which was a fairly insensitive way to draw the boundary given that there was no ill intent.\n\nI do think a small apology would be in order.", "YTA. You went wrong twice\n\n>   I explained to her exactly how this was affecting my kids, how it made them feel inferior \n\nWe all know it unfortunately made you feel that way.  Had you explained ie ADMITTED that in a sincere fashion this conversation may have gone much better\n\n>   otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t want her to spend a lot of time with them \n\nSo you would punish everyone by depriving each other of family, essentially blackmailing her and holding your kids hostage", "YTA because of they way you\u2019ve gone about it. This is more about you than your children. I sense that you feel some kind of guilt or shame at not being able to afford these things for your children, and it\u2019s manifesting against your sister. Your sister is child free, has disposable income, and wants to spoil your kids! While setting boundaries is ok, it sounds like you firmly shut down all gift giving without even acknowledging that what she was doing was out of love for her nieces and nephews. A more reasonable boundary might be that these gifts be restricted to occasions (birthday, Christmas, Easter, for my life\u2019s example, but whatever gifting holidays you practice) rather than it being a gift bonanza whenever auntie drops by.", "Nta but why wouldn't you apologize, it's your sister after all", "NTA, she was asked to stop before and kept doing it. Your sister and her wife didn't respect your wishes.", "YTA. I think you feel bad that you can\u2019t afford these things. Aunties are supposed to spoil kids. I think you have a great sister. You have not done a good job explaining to your kids that these are treats and they need to say thank you and appreciate them.", "NTA, I don't really think your sister is T A either. Your SIL giving you an ultimatum like that is pretty shitty though. Obviously you don't have to apologize to your sister, the way you brought up your concerns seemed pretty reasonable. You should definitely have a discussion with your sister to let her know you didn't mean to hurt her feelings. Let her know that the way your SIL talks to you is unacceptable too, she doesn't get to dictate whether or not you get to talk to your sister.", "NTA.\n\nYou set a reasonable boundary and it\u2018s important for your children not to get everything, especially when they have to rely on someone else for it.", ">how it made them feel inferior and made thrm expect too muc\n\nYou realise these are mutually exclusive?\n\nYTA. This is about you feeling inferior, but that feeling is about you, and its yours too process and deal with. Don't give excuses based on your children. My brother and I were fortunate to have an aunt and uncle who every birthday and Christmas for us good quality clothes. They were higher quality than what my parents could afford, but it meant we always had something smart or hard wearing etc if needed. My Parents were super grateful, as we're we.", "NAH...but you shouldn't have even brought up the possibility of not seeing the kids.  That was pretty harsh and probably wording for if she did it again after you set such a clear boundary.  You're allowed to set boundaries and limits.  While I agree with some people that the one being made to feel inferior is you, I don't think that makes you an AH.  YOU are the one who sees the changes in your kids, though, and if you don't think their aunt spoiling them is healthy, that is ABSOLUTELY your choice.", "NAH. You asked her to cut back, you didn't ask her not to buy gifts. Cut back isn't a clear instruction, so she's not an AH for buying a gift for your daughter after this initial conversation. \n\nYou're not an AH for setting boundaries on what you find acceptable for your children. \n\nBut you're depriving your children of nice things because you can't be bothered to work through the short patch of expectation this has caused in your kids. It is new for them, and it has confused their sense of money, but you just teach them that. And then they can have nice things and understand the  value of money... win win.", "NAH\nI was this aunt.  I genuinely meant well and because  I didn't live close to my niece and nephew, each time I visited, I showered them with whatever gifts they wanted.  My sister resented it and hid the gifts or showed disdain. I felt very hurt by what felt like rejection of how I expressed my love.  The final straw was when i got my 6yr old niece a very fine beautiful wool coat which i thought would be kind to her eczema prone skin and my sister just left the coat in the wardrobe never to be worn. That was 12 yrs ago. We came to an understanding, my unrestrained gifting has since been limited to birthdays and Christmas and literally never had any conflict since. Give it time, space and talk when everyone is calmer. If it means apologising just to enable the dialogue, then do it. I have a wonderful relationship with my niece and nephew which doesn't involve gifts or money.", "IMO no one's the asshole here.\n\nYour sister has good intentions (but i also think the whole crying thing was a little much) and i understand your POV as well(you don't want your kids to be spoilt and take you for granted). It will be good if you talk to your sister again and tell her to bring gifts only on special occasions. Set some sort of boundaries (even if she makes a fuss about it).\n\n\nBut also make sure your kids don't take you for granted because at the end of the day you're the one taking care of them", "YTA. The gifts don\u2019t make your kids feel inferior\u2026they make YOU feel inferior. Work on yourself.", "NAH it sounds like you discussed your concerns with her in a sensitive way, you didn\u2019t say not to bring gifts, and she probably didn\u2019t realize the effect it was having. But your sister is also not the asshole for buying gifts for her niblings. If she refuses and continues to do so she would be venturing into that territory but given what\u2019s happened here I don\u2019t think either of you are assholes. Just that she\u2019s sensitive. Limiting her contact with them if she continues to do so seems a bit harsh but idk how else you reinforce the boundary. \n\nI would apologize she was hurt by your comment but reiterate that this is important to you.", "I was going to say no AH until I read this part \n\n*I explained to her exactly how this was affecting my kids, how it made them feel inferior*\n\nNo .. it doesn't make your kids feel inferior. It makes **you** feel inferior. \n\nSo therefore my final judgement is soft YTA.", "YTA you have to teach your children that is not ok demand gifts to people, and don't project your insecurity to your children.\nYou are are lucky enough to have a sister that can afford to buy stuff to your children that you can't buy, even if that things are not necessary if you had the money you would buy these things too for your children or hers", "NAH\n\nYour sister is doing something lovely and although I understand your concern about not being able to afford those items yourself, it is a pity that you can't let your kids enjoy being spoilt a bit from their aunt. \n\nYou all mean well here and I'm sure you can work out how to have a mature conversation with the kids about it whilst letting them enjoy their aunt who spoils them occassionally.", "What\u2019s a DH?", "YTA. Your kids are old enough to understand people have different budgets. And their aunt has more disposable income so she afford to splurge while you can\u2019t because you have lower paying jobs and are raising a family. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault. But it doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s making your kids feel inferior I. It feels like you\u2019re the one feeling inferior. Which you shouldn\u2019t. You do what you can and that\u2019s great. It depends on the frequency of those gifts too. If it\u2019s once in a while or for a special occasion then great you can explain to your kids that\u2019s it\u2019s a treat. If it\u2019s once a week or something very frequent then maybe ask her to space out the gifts so they\u2019re not spoiled. But make sure she feels appreciated for even thinking of her niblings.", "Great catch!

What I meant is the aunt isn't the one who's around the kids all the time, so if they are behaving poorly it's not entirely her fault and OP should take some responsibility for it. \n\nMaybe a good solution would be for OP to ask sister to put the money they would have spent on gifts in to a college fund or something?", "Eh.
