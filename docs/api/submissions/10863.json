Clearly her love language is in giving things.  However, you are right.  If you and your husband can't remotely afford to give the kinds of gifts they can, it's not helping the kids at all.\n\nI would say she is not the AH --- except for the fact that you **told her** to cut down on it.  And she didn't listen.  That makes her the AH here.\n\nIf she wants to give money to your kids, maybe ask if she can put most of the money she'd spend on the gift into a college fund for the kids.  So she can still buy your kids things --- things that are on a par with what you could afford --- and benefit the kids' futures at the same time.", "NTA. It's a difficult situation but you did talk to your sister about it and she continued to do what she wanted. I her that it wasn't malicious but she still broke a boundary that you clearly set for her. You have nothing to apologise for.", "ESH. You failed to explain this well to your kids, and at the same time your sister had no intution and sense for your feelings and your situation.

Things are tight for me too. And I had similar issues with my ex-MIL. It\u2019s hard, I know.

She wants to spoil them like they are her own, so understand that it\u2019s coming from a good place, a place of love. \n\nI don\u2019t know the exact conversation you had. And I know that you had to be firm, set the boundaries and tell her to stop breaking them\u2026 is it possible that\u2026 out of frustration and that feeling of inferiority\u2026 that you may have been a bit harsh this time? \n\nDo not apologize for setting boundaries, or being firm with a person who has a hard time accepting those boundaries\u2026 but if you look back at it with a clearer mind and realize that there was a more tactful way, then apologize for that\u2026 and explain that you were frustrated cause she hasn\u2019t listened to you in the past.", "NTA I get that she is trying to help out, but you have to parent them and you are trying to raise them to understand the financial reality that you live in and they are not learning the value of money if things are always given to them.

It would be far more valuable than material junk.", ">She said she was disappointed in me and asked me to not disturb her wife anymore unless I apologised.\r  \n\r\n\nProblem solved - her wife (your sister) doesn't want any interaction with you unless she's allowed to buy your kids expensive gifts.\n\nCalmly explain to her wife that if she cannot simply enjoy family time, and has to make it about expensive gifts, then her choice to judge family time \"not worth the effort\" is regrettable but you accept it.\n\nNo, you're not the asshole. I am in this position with my nephew - I either don't buy anything or make the gift \"from everyone\". The fact I'm using my higher salary to buy things is completely invisible - I would *never* put parents in the position of your sister is placing you in.\n\nBut then again, I don't need children to specifically view me as \"better\" than their parents. That's the only motivation for her behavior, it's the only reason why it would be upsetting if she were deprived of the ability to attribute expensive gifts to herself.\n\nThe fact she has that unnatural need to be viewed as wealthy by children is not your fault, although she's sure making it your problem.", "NAH. Have you ever thought that giving is her love language? Also, have you ever thought that maybe she knows that you aren\u2019t as well off so she\u2019s spoiling your kids to spoil you? I lost my dog last year and got a new puppy, and last Christmas multiple people got me dog toys, treats, etc. I could have taken it as I wasn\u2019t being a good dog \u201cparent\u201d but figured they knew I was having a hard time and were covering the treats so I could cover the essentials. So, their plan was to take care of me. \nThat being said I could see where you might be a bit resentful, but you can absolutely teach the kids about how treats and special things are just that, special. And they wouldn\u2019t be as special if you have them every day. Maybe work with your sister on more reasonable expectations like seeing a movie or going out to eat instead of pricey items, or work with her to identify things that the kids would get the most use/enjoyment out of so she can still gift without making you feel like what you provide isn\u2019t good enough.

I can see that AITA now\u2026my sis is loaded and gives my kids cheap shit. \n\nYour kids are old enough to understand that Aunties don\u2019t have kids and love spoiling them every now and again, but they should realize that you don\u2019t have that kind of budget for luxury items, so they need to keep this in perspective and not demand things, even from Aunties. \n\nHow is this \u2018harmful\u2019 exactly? \n\nSorry but YTA.\n\nAnd also\u2026using your kids as leverage and threatening to cut her off in that slick way you did makes you the real ah here.", "Definitely NTA.", "YTA. Your sister wants to buy your kids expensive gifts they can\u2019t otherwise have, because she can, she enjoys it, and she thinks they do too. You threatened to cut her access to the kids if she didn\u2019t stop being generous to your kids. She apologized and said she\u2019ll stop. She was hurt by your threatening approach about not letting her spend time with them (which in my view clearly reflects your own insecurities about money). She agreed to your terms but was hurt and sad about what you said and how you said it, and she told her wife. Her wife thought surely you wouldn\u2019t have been so harsh with your sister if you knew you hurt her so much, so she told you that and asked you to apologize to your sister. Did I get that right?  How are you not TA?", "NTA. You could say that you're sorry she took your request as something hurtful, but it was a request you won't be backing down on because they're you're kids and it's YOU that has to cope with the fall-out.\n\nShe is literally trying to buy affection and maybe a bit of control over you, although I wouldn't say that. This never goes well. Tell her that giving gifts is lovely, and you appreciate it very much. But kids wreck things and fight over things and get jealous and expect the same again. So gifts should be cheap and cheerful unless you've sanctioned something bigger.", "YTA. I want to say you're not the asshole. I really do, but... You kinda are in this situation. I know it's hard, especially the kids behavior, but... Kids spend more time with you than they do their aunt.

I would just explain the situation, and make them understand that the gifts you give them are smaller but full of love, that you won't always be able to get them big aunty's gifts, and that this is okay.

This is more about you than your children. I sense that you feel some kind of guilt or shame at not being able to afford these things for your children, and it\u2019s manifesting against your sister. Your sister is child free, has disposable income, and wants to spoil your kids! While setting boundaries is ok, it sounds like you firmly shut down all gift giving without even acknowledging that what she was doing was out of love for her nieces and nephews. A more reasonable boundary might be that these gifts be restricted to occasions (birthday, Christmas, Easter, for my life\u2019s example, but whatever gifting holidays you practice) rather than it being a gift bonanza whenever auntie drops by.", "Nta but why wouldn't you apologize, it's your sister after all", "NTA, she was asked to stop before and kept doing it.

That was pretty harsh and probably wording for if she did it again after you set such a clear boundary.  You're allowed to set boundaries and limits.  While I agree with some people that the one being made to feel inferior is you, I don't think that makes you an AH.  YOU are the one who sees the changes in your kids, though, and if you don't think their aunt spoiling them is healthy, that is ABSOLUTELY your choice.", "NAH. You asked her to cut back, you didn't ask her not to buy gifts. Cut back isn't a clear instruction, so she's not an AH for buying a gift for your daughter after this initial conversation. \n\nYou're not an AH for setting boundaries on what you find acceptable for your children. \n\nBut you're depriving your children of nice things because you can't be bothered to work through the short patch of expectation this has caused in your kids. It is new for them, and it has confused their sense of money, but you just teach them that. And then they can have nice things and understand the  value of money... win win.", "NAH\nI was this aunt.  I genuinely meant well and because  I didn't live close to my niece and nephew, each time I visited, I showered them with whatever gifts they wanted.  My sister resented it and hid the gifts or showed disdain. I felt very hurt by what felt like rejection of how I expressed my love.  The final straw was when i got my 6yr old niece a very fine beautiful wool coat which i thought would be kind to her eczema prone skin and my sister just left the coat in the wardrobe never to be worn. That was 12 yrs ago. We came to an understanding, my unrestrained gifting has since been limited to birthdays and Christmas and literally never had any conflict since.

If she refuses and continues to do so she would be venturing into that territory but given what\u2019s happened here I don\u2019t think either of you are assholes. Just that she\u2019s sensitive.

However, are you sure that\u2019s its your kids who are feeling inferior and not you? If so, it\u2019s a bit selfish of you to deny your kids occasional nice gifts (like a coat or make-up) because you aren\u2019t the one who can provide them. Also - be careful not to look a gift horse in the mouth. Childfree aunts and uncles with large disposable incomes can be a huge help. It would be hypocritical for you to tell her to knock it off now\u2026if you\u2019re only going to come back later and ask for help with something.", "YTA. Due to your jealousy, you are forbidding your kids from having nice things. She is bringing no strings attached, expensive gifts - you should be happy, not sad.\n\nAlso, if you cannot afford nice things, don\u2019t make 3 kids. Make one but be able to afford nice things.", "\"It make them feel inferior and made them expect too much\" \n\nNo. It's making YOU feel inferior because you can't spend that type of money so say that like it is. \n\nLook, I 100% understand where you are coming from. Because I can't always afford to buy my kid expensive shit and my mom (he's her only grandchild) will spend hundreds or even a couple thousand on him during holidays, birthdays and random visits. Does it hurt me a bit that I can't be the one to do that? Yes, but why should my kid miss out on all those great things just because I can't buy them for him, if others can and are willing and happy to do it? \n\nI had a conversation with my child last holiday season (he is 6) and explained to him that the expensive presents came from grandma and aunty (because me and my husband are Santa) and that he has to be grateful but not spoiled. That is okay to enjoy his presents but not to expect presents like this 24/7. He understood and now if I say I can't afford it he'll say something along the lines of \"when I'm big I'm gonna work for a lot of money and I'm gonna get me one and get papi one too and you can share!\" (His dad is his favorite person) and that just melts my heart because it shows me I am raising a polite, kind and understanding child. So if my 6 y/o can understand this (trust me I sat for days looking for the right words so he would get it, he is a child and I have to break things down to his level of understanding) so could your children. \n\nSo NAH in my honest opinion. She is the fun aunty that everyone wishes they could be. You are a concerned mom. But no one here is really being an asshole.", "NTA. I'd steer her towards saving college funds for the kids or maybe taking them in trips or experiences rather than blowing it on expensive toys. Where's a kid going to wear a $2k coat to? She drops a bomb in your life then leaves.\n\nKids need to learn that they can't have everything they want, that budgets are real. Do they get an allowance? The last thing you want is for the kids to turn into spendtrifts chasing after the most expensive thing to keep up with the Joneses. \n\nYou also just have to be more comfortable saying No to them.

Sister is old enough to stand up for herself though SIL actions makes me wonder about the dynamics of their relationship.", "NAH. I understand your point of view, but it strikes me that there's a simpler solution: when your kids start asking for shit you can't yourselves afford, tell them to ask their aunt.\n\nEither she'll buy them what they want, and the kids will be happy, or she'll realise that she's opened Pandora's (money)box, and cool it.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my family went from one extreme to the other. I remember the Christmas where we got stockings almost as long as we were tall stuffed with presents, **plus** then my dad wheeled us out a bicycle each. He had a carphone in like 1987. We had a boat even though we didn't actually live near the water.\n\n2 years later, everything was different. He lost his sizeable manufacturing business and ended up working for our neighbour's fencing business, we lost the boat, my mother ended up driving a car from the Sixties that had rear seatbelts crudely added with exposed bolts. They had to sell the house they'd built less than 5 years before and move us to another state when a friend offered my dad a job in his old industry.\n\nI'm not kidding when I say it took my parents 20 years and a lot of hard work and good fortune to get back to the point where they could buy a home again.\n\nI say all that to say this: your kids having stuff you can't afford doesn't mean they'll grow up not understanding the value of a dollar, thinking you're lesser compared to your sister and her wife, or whatever you're worried about.\n\nThat's going to come down to you making sure they understand that life is different for different people, they should be grateful for whatever they get from whomever they get it, and the importance of those who have much being generous to those who have little.\n\nI'm grateful to the friend who gave my father a job that allowed him to return to his industry (though I was miserable about having to move at the time, not understanding it at all). I'm grateful to my uncle and his friend for agreeing to invest the startup capital for my parents' new business a few years down the line.\n\nThese weren't even entirely altruistic gestures - the friend got a lot of great work out of my dad, and in fact the new business my parents started involved them buying part of his. My uncle and his friend did very well when the business eventually sold to a multinational, considering they were silent partners who did no work.\n\nSo, I understand you're concerned about the way your kids are acting now, but I think the better thing to do is to teach them to understand that these things can happen for them because of their aunt's generosity, and to be appropriately grateful that this is even possible.\n\nIdeally, if they understand the situation properly, it will mean they grow into adults who are willing to do the same for their relatives, should they have the opportunity.", "YTA \n\nThis isn\u2019t about how your kids feel, this is about how this makes you feel.

Then it has educational and social value but they won\u2019t become materialistic.", "soft YTA because the problem is not the children's reactions but yours.

I wonder if your sister might consider doing something slightly different for your kids, buying gifts which are in line with what you could afford as parents but putting the difference into some sort of trust fund/account for the kids to access when they turn 18?
