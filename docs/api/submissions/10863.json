(Her wife works a high-end job and she's a very big spender).\n\nShe would bring expensive clothing items like purses, dresses or makeup products for my daughter, games for my son, sometimes electronic devices. It is confusing for my kids because they have been acting differently since she has been doing this. They push for items and ask for things way out of our budget. My husband and I have to explain every time how we can not afford things like their aunt. I asked my sister before to cut back but she hasn't really listened too much.\n\nThis time she brought my daughter a coat that was worth double my rent. I asked her to come in the kitchen and told her that she should cut back on these gifts. I explained to her exactly how this was affecting my kids, how it made them feel inferior and made thrm expect too much, I also told her it was harmful and asked her to please stop getting them gifts that were this expensive, and that otherwise, I wouldn't want her to spend a lot of time with them.\n\nShe told me she just wanted to make them happy and apologised. I thought that was the end of it. At night I get a phone call from my SIL (my sister's wife) saying I had really hurt my sister emotionally with tbe way I put things, that she cried when she got home. She said she was disappointed in me and asked me to not disturb my sister unless it was to apologise.\n\nEdit: This is also partially why I am so over this. My SIL is a pretty chill person overall. She would be the calmer person even in the most stressful situation. However, when there is even a small problem between my sister and I she loses all that chill energy and inserts herself into the issue. Problem is, my sister is all for it. I don't even know at this point\n\nMy sister is a very sensitive and emotional person but I don't see what I did wrong here?

Clearly her love language is in giving things.  However, you are right.  If you and your husband can't remotely afford to give the kinds of gifts they can, it's not helping the kids at all.\n\nI would say she is not the AH --- except for the fact that you **told her** to cut down on it.  And she didn't listen.  That makes her the AH here.\n\nIf she wants to give money to your kids, maybe ask if she can put most of the money she'd spend on the gift into a college fund for the kids.  So she can still buy your kids things --- things that are on a par with what you could afford --- and benefit the kids' futures at the same time.", "NTA. It's a difficult situation but you did talk to your sister about it and she continued to do what she wanted. I her that it wasn't malicious but she still broke a boundary that you clearly set for her. You have nothing to apologise for.", "ESH. You failed to explain this well to your kids, and at the same time your sister had no intution and sense for your feelings and your situation.

Things are tight for me too. And I had similar issues with my ex-MIL. It\u2019s hard, I know.

She wants to spoil them like they are her own, so understand that it\u2019s coming from a good place, a place of love. \n\nI don\u2019t know the exact conversation you had. And I know that you had to be firm, set the boundaries and tell her to stop breaking them\u2026 is it possible that\u2026 out of frustration and that feeling of inferiority\u2026 that you may have been a bit harsh this time? \n\nDo not apologize for setting boundaries, or being firm with a person who has a hard time accepting those boundaries\u2026 but if you look back at it with a clearer mind and realize that there was a more tactful way, then apologize for that\u2026 and explain that you were frustrated cause she hasn\u2019t listened to you in the past.", "NTA I get that she is trying to help out, but you have to parent them and you are trying to raise them to understand the financial reality that you live in and they are not learning the value of money if things are always given to them.

It would be far more valuable than material junk.", ">She said she was disappointed in me and asked me to not disturb her wife anymore unless I apologised.\r  \n\r\n\nProblem solved - her wife (your sister) doesn't want any interaction with you unless she's allowed to buy your kids expensive gifts.\n\nCalmly explain to her wife that if she cannot simply enjoy family time, and has to make it about expensive gifts, then her choice to judge family time \"not worth the effort\" is regrettable but you accept it.\n\nNo, you're not the asshole. I am in this position with my nephew - I either don't buy anything or make the gift \"from everyone\". The fact I'm using my higher salary to buy things is completely invisible - I would *never* put parents in the position of your sister is placing you in.\n\nBut then again, I don't need children to specifically view me as \"better\" than their parents. That's the only motivation for her behavior, it's the only reason why it would be upsetting if she were deprived of the ability to attribute expensive gifts to herself.\n\nThe fact she has that unnatural need to be viewed as wealthy by children is not your fault, although she's sure making it your problem.", "NAH. Have you ever thought that giving is her love language? Also, have you ever thought that maybe she knows that you aren\u2019t as well off so she\u2019s spoiling your kids to spoil you? I lost my dog last year and got a new puppy, and last Christmas multiple people got me dog toys, treats, etc. I could have taken it as I wasn\u2019t being a good dog \u201cparent\u201d but figured they knew I was having a hard time and were covering the treats so I could cover the essentials. So, their plan was to take care of me. \nThat being said I could see where you might be a bit resentful, but you can absolutely teach the kids about how treats and special things are just that, special. And they wouldn\u2019t be as special if you have them every day. Maybe work with your sister on more reasonable expectations like seeing a movie or going out to eat instead of pricey items, or work with her to identify things that the kids would get the most use/enjoyment out of so she can still gift without making you feel like what you provide isn\u2019t good enough.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with having a rich relative who is generous. In fact, it\u2019s better than one who doesn\u2019t do anything for their niblings. I can see that AITA now\u2026my sis is loaded and gives my kids cheap shit. \n\nYour kids are old enough to understand that Aunties don\u2019t have kids and love spoiling them every now and again, but they should realize that you don\u2019t have that kind of budget for luxury items, so they need to keep this in perspective and not demand things, even from Aunties. \n\nHow is this \u2018harmful\u2019 exactly? \n\nSorry but YTA.\n\nAnd also\u2026using your kids as leverage and threatening to cut her off in that slick way you did makes you the real ah here.", "Definitely NTA.", "YTA. Your sister wants to buy your kids expensive gifts they can\u2019t otherwise have, because she can, she enjoys it, and she thinks they do too. You threatened to cut her access to the kids if she didn\u2019t stop being generous to your kids. She apologized and said she\u2019ll stop. She was hurt by your threatening approach about not letting her spend time with them (which in my view clearly reflects your own insecurities about money). She agreed to your terms but was hurt and sad about what you said and how you said it, and she told her wife. Her wife thought surely you wouldn\u2019t have been so harsh with your sister if you knew you hurt her so much, so she told you that and asked you to apologize to your sister. Did I get that right?  How are you not TA?", "NTA. You could say that you're sorry she took your request as something hurtful, but it was a request you won't be backing down on because they're you're kids and it's YOU that has to cope with the fall-out.\n\nShe is literally trying to buy affection and maybe a bit of control over you, although I wouldn't say that. This never goes well. Tell her that giving gifts is lovely, and you appreciate it very much. But kids wreck things and fight over things and get jealous and expect the same again. So gifts should be cheap and cheerful unless you've sanctioned something bigger.", "YTA. I want to say you're not the asshole. I really do, but... You kinda are in this situation. I know it's hard, especially the kids behavior, but... Kids spend more time with you than they do their aunt.

I would just explain the situation, and make them understand that the gifts you give them are smaller but full of love, that you won't always be able to get them big aunty's gifts, and that this is okay. Then just raise them with love; they'll understand, will get to enjoy expensive things, and your relationship as their parents will still be one of the strongest bonds.", "Teensy tiny YTA. When you sat down to draw that very reasonable boundary, which you had every right to draw, it doesn't look like there was any acknowledgment on your part of her kindness, thoughtfulness or generosity. After all, it seems she was spoiling your kids out of love. Her intentions were good, even if the result was not.\n\nUnfortunately your approach acted like she was doing something malicious and took her to task, which was a fairly insensitive way to draw the boundary given that there was no ill intent.\n\nI do think a small apology would be in order.", "YTA.

This is more about you than your children. I sense that you feel some kind of guilt or shame at not being able to afford these things for your children, and it\u2019s manifesting against your sister. Your sister is child free, has disposable income, and wants to spoil your kids! While setting boundaries is ok, it sounds like you firmly shut down all gift giving without even acknowledging that what she was doing was out of love for her nieces and nephews. A more reasonable boundary might be that these gifts be restricted to occasions (birthday, Christmas, Easter, for my life\u2019s example, but whatever gifting holidays you practice) rather than it being a gift bonanza whenever auntie drops by.", "Nta but why wouldn't you apologize, it's your sister after all", "NTA, she was asked to stop before and kept doing it.

Your SIL giving you an ultimatum like that is pretty shitty though. Obviously you don't have to apologize to your sister, the way you brought up your concerns seemed pretty reasonable.

That was pretty harsh and probably wording for if she did it again after you set such a clear boundary.  You're allowed to set boundaries and limits.  While I agree with some people that the one being made to feel inferior is you, I don't think that makes you an AH.  YOU are the one who sees the changes in your kids, though, and if you don't think their aunt spoiling them is healthy, that is ABSOLUTELY your choice.", "NAH. You asked her to cut back, you didn't ask her not to buy gifts. Cut back isn't a clear instruction, so she's not an AH for buying a gift for your daughter after this initial conversation. \n\nYou're not an AH for setting boundaries on what you find acceptable for your children. \n\nBut you're depriving your children of nice things because you can't be bothered to work through the short patch of expectation this has caused in your kids. It is new for them, and it has confused their sense of money, but you just teach them that. And then they can have nice things and understand the  value of money... win win.", "NAH\nI was this aunt.  I genuinely meant well and because  I didn't live close to my niece and nephew, each time I visited, I showered them with whatever gifts they wanted.  My sister resented it and hid the gifts or showed disdain. I felt very hurt by what felt like rejection of how I expressed my love.  The final straw was when i got my 6yr old niece a very fine beautiful wool coat which i thought would be kind to her eczema prone skin and my sister just left the coat in the wardrobe never to be worn. That was 12 yrs ago. We came to an understanding, my unrestrained gifting has since been limited to birthdays and Christmas and literally never had any conflict since.

But your sister is also not the asshole for buying gifts for her niblings. If she refuses and continues to do so she would be venturing into that territory but given what\u2019s happened here I don\u2019t think either of you are assholes. Just that she\u2019s sensitive.

They can also understand that there are people better off financially than your family. It\u2019s your job to teach this. Your 10 and 12 yos behavior changes probably have more to do with being 10 and 12 than with the gifts they\u2019re receiving\u2026 that\u2019s just the current outlet.

(12f and 10m are literally my least favorite parenting years by gender yet) Sister should take you request to heart. Has she always shown love by giving? She can definitely tone it down and this isn\u2019t a hurtful thing to ask of her. But asking she stop giving entirely might be asking her to stop showing she cares.", "NTA - They are your kids so you get to make the decision. However, are you sure that\u2019s its your kids who are feeling inferior and not you?

Also - be careful not to look a gift horse in the mouth. Childfree aunts and uncles with large disposable incomes can be a huge help.

Make one but be able to afford nice things.", "\"It make them feel inferior and made them expect too much\" \n\nNo. It's making YOU feel inferior because you can't spend that type of money so say that like it is. \n\nLook, I 100% understand where you are coming from. Because I can't always afford to buy my kid expensive shit and my mom (he's her only grandchild) will spend hundreds or even a couple thousand on him during holidays, birthdays and random visits. Does it hurt me a bit that I can't be the one to do that? Yes, but why should my kid miss out on all those great things just because I can't buy them for him, if others can and are willing and happy to do it? \n\nI had a conversation with my child last holiday season (he is 6) and explained to him that the expensive presents came from grandma and aunty (because me and my husband are Santa) and that he has to be grateful but not spoiled. That is okay to enjoy his presents but not to expect presents like this 24/7. He understood and now if I say I can't afford it he'll say something along the lines of \"when I'm big I'm gonna work for a lot of money and I'm gonna get me one and get papi one too and you can share!\" (His dad is his favorite person) and that just melts my heart because it shows me I am raising a polite, kind and understanding child. So if my 6 y/o can understand this (trust me I sat for days looking for the right words so he would get it, he is a child and I have to break things down to his level of understanding) so could your children. \n\nSo NAH in my honest opinion. She is the fun aunty that everyone wishes they could be. You are a concerned mom. But no one here is really being an asshole.", "NTA.

The last thing you want is for the kids to turn into spendtrifts chasing after the most expensive thing to keep up with the Joneses. \n\nYou also just have to be more comfortable saying No to them.

I understand your point of view, but it strikes me that there's a simpler solution: when your kids start asking for shit you can't yourselves afford, tell them to ask their aunt.\n\nEither she'll buy them what they want, and the kids will be happy, or she'll realise that she's opened Pandora's (money)box, and cool it.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my family went from one extreme to the other. I remember the Christmas where we got stockings almost as long as we were tall stuffed with presents, **plus** then my dad wheeled us out a bicycle each. He had a carphone in like 1987. We had a boat even though we didn't actually live near the water.\n\n2 years later, everything was different. He lost his sizeable manufacturing business and ended up working for our neighbour's fencing business, we lost the boat, my mother ended up driving a car from the Sixties that had rear seatbelts crudely added with exposed bolts. They had to sell the house they'd built less than 5 years before and move us to another state when a friend offered my dad a job in his old industry.\n\nI'm not kidding when I say it took my parents 20 years and a lot of hard work and good fortune to get back to the point where they could buy a home again.\n\nI say all that to say this: your kids having stuff you can't afford doesn't mean they'll grow up not understanding the value of a dollar, thinking you're lesser compared to your sister and her wife, or whatever you're worried about.\n\nThat's going to come down to you making sure they understand that life is different for different people, they should be grateful for whatever they get from whomever they get it, and the importance of those who have much being generous to those who have little.\n\nI'm grateful to the friend who gave my father a job that allowed him to return to his industry (though I was miserable about having to move at the time, not understanding it at all). I'm grateful to my uncle and his friend for agreeing to invest the startup capital for my parents' new business a few years down the line.\n\nThese weren't even entirely altruistic gestures - the friend got a lot of great work out of my dad, and in fact the new business my parents started involved them buying part of his. My uncle and his friend did very well when the business eventually sold to a multinational, considering they were silent partners who did no work.\n\nSo, I understand you're concerned about the way your kids are acting now, but I think the better thing to do is to teach them to understand that these things can happen for them because of their aunt's generosity, and to be appropriately grateful that this is even possible.\n\nIdeally, if they understand the situation properly, it will mean they grow into adults who are willing to do the same for their relatives, should they have the opportunity.", "YTA \n\nThis isn\u2019t about how your kids feel, this is about how this makes you feel.

NAH", "**INFO: What is your current habit for saving for your kids\u2019 education?** An occasional expensive gift on a birthday or holiday is one thing, but a random fur coat for one child that is worth twice your rent is way too much, imho. I understand the generous spirit, but I think there needs to be some healthy guidelines \u2014 and that is ultimately your choice as parents, no one else.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should necessarily cut her off completely, as that will just breed resentment all around. I don\u2019t even think you need to limit her overall spending *IF* there\u2019s an agreement that everyone respects. There is not a one-size-fits-all solution here. \n\nMaybe have a requirement that all gifts over $20/$50/$100 in a month or outside \u201cnormal\u201d gifting holidays (whatever makes sense for your family) must have an accompanying \u201cdonation\u201d of an equal amount to their college fund? And probably they need to also get your approval beforehand \u2014 no more surprise coats. It may at least cut the lavish gifts in half, and if not then at least they will have some extra money saved for college, trade school, or maybe even a down payment on a house\u2026the things that can actually make a huge difference in their life.\n\nDefinitely contact an accountant on the best way to send up those types of accounts, and you want to make it easy for family to contribute. I think my parents set some up for their grandchildren. If this isn\u2019t obvious, NEVER TOUCH THAT MONEY. I believe it\u2019s a special account similar to a retirement account with restrictions of withdrawals (but don\u2019t quote me on that). I believe there are tax benefits, too, or at least the recipient doesn\u2019t have to pay taxes once they get it? Again, please look into it. It\u2019s NOT a regular savings account.\n\nI\u2019ve definitely heard of parents making a conscious effort to not just buy toys and junk for gifts, as that all adds up over time. Toys especially can essentially be a waste of money a lot of the time, and a lot of it just ends up in the landfill. Many parents make contributions to college accounts, buy books and education gifts, take them to museums and zoos, etc. I agree that you don\u2019t want to raise entitled spoiled brats, and you need to proceed carefully so they don\u2019t blame everything on you. I think there is a happy medium to be found, and I hope you do!\n\nAs it stands, I\u2019m actually going to vote ESH because it sounds like there\u2019s a lot of necessary communication and boundaries that are simply not being done or made here. This is probably a relatively common occurrence for parents, and a good family therapist/counselor may be a good source of advice.\n\nPS: I heard something in a documentary that has stuck with me over the years. She said one way you can spot financial trouble is seeing a home filled with many \u201cthings\u201d (like toys, stuffed animals) but relatively few pieces of [quality] furniture. I\u2019m butchering the reference, but I think of the concept often.

Basically, homosexual uncles and aunts are \u201cbiologically predisposed to help raise the offspring of their siblings and other relatives.\u201d They will display altruistic behavior towards the offspring of their siblings. So, your sister isn\u2019t trying to harm your children, but wants to show her support and love, albeit in a way that you cannot.\n\nAdd on that she is dual income no kids (DINK) and one of her love languages is most likely gifts, this is her display of love and support. For her to find out that this is unwelcome and harmful is definitely not going to feel good. This is how she knows how to show she cares and she is only 24, so let\u2019s assume her parenting skills are minimal at best.\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely right that your kids are behaving differently when they are given expensive things. Child psychologists and sociologists see adverse effects in giving extravagant gifts to children in that excessive gifts can give the child a sense of entitlement from getting something they have not earned, and gives them the idea that material wealth is all you need [(source)](https://www.pd.co.ke/lifestyle/should-parents-give-extravagant-gifts-to-children-96760/?amp). Also the excessive gifts are usually an attempt to make up for not being able to spend enough time with the children. You should definitely be concerned about this and try to curb this behavior.\n\nSo the AH behavior in your part is not being able to see that your sister is young, dumb and full of cash. You also threatened to cut her out of your kids life. She is currently upset because there is a dissonance between the intent and effect of her actions \u2013 trying to show love but causing harm.\n\nYou should definitely apologize, but also thank her for her generosity. She\u2019s trying her best but is misguided and needs to understand why, and she should be spending more time with the kids, not less.

They wanted to give something tangible the kids could see and play with to remind them their aunt/uncle/grandparents care about them. \n\nImagine if your less wealthy family members (paycheck-to-paycheck) asked you to stop giving gifts to their kids, but instead contribute to their rent or grocery bills? It would probably feel similar to what his wealthy family members felt. \n\nYou probably should have let your husband have that conversation with his family. He knows them better and could have navigated their expectations better. For example, suggesting they buy investment stocks for the kid's birthdays to teach them about money and saving. And let Christmas still be fun gifts. Or some sort of compromise between saving for the future and fun gifts."]}
