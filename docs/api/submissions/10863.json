Clearly her love language is in giving things.  However, you are right.  If you and your husband can't remotely afford to give the kinds of gifts they can, it's not helping the kids at all.\n\nI would say she is not the AH --- except for the fact that you **told her** to cut down on it.  And she didn't listen.  That makes her the AH here.\n\nIf she wants to give money to your kids, maybe ask if she can put most of the money she'd spend on the gift into a college fund for the kids.  So she can still buy your kids things --- things that are on a par with what you could afford --- and benefit the kids' futures at the same time.", "NTA. It's a difficult situation but you did talk to your sister about it and she continued to do what she wanted. I her that it wasn't malicious but she still broke a boundary that you clearly set for her. You have nothing to apologise for.", "ESH. You failed to explain this well to your kids, and at the same time your sister had no intution and sense for your feelings and your situation.

Things are tight for me too. And I had similar issues with my ex-MIL. It\u2019s hard, I know.

She wants to spoil them like they are her own, so understand that it\u2019s coming from a good place, a place of love. \n\nI don\u2019t know the exact conversation you had. And I know that you had to be firm, set the boundaries and tell her to stop breaking them\u2026 is it possible that\u2026 out of frustration and that feeling of inferiority\u2026 that you may have been a bit harsh this time? \n\nDo not apologize for setting boundaries, or being firm with a person who has a hard time accepting those boundaries\u2026 but if you look back at it with a clearer mind and realize that there was a more tactful way, then apologize for that\u2026 and explain that you were frustrated cause she hasn\u2019t listened to you in the past.", "NTA I get that she is trying to help out, but you have to parent them and you are trying to raise them to understand the financial reality that you live in and they are not learning the value of money if things are always given to them.

It would be far more valuable than material junk.", ">She said she was disappointed in me and asked me to not disturb her wife anymore unless I apologised.\r  \n\r\n\nProblem solved - her wife (your sister) doesn't want any interaction with you unless she's allowed to buy your kids expensive gifts.\n\nCalmly explain to her wife that if she cannot simply enjoy family time, and has to make it about expensive gifts, then her choice to judge family time \"not worth the effort\" is regrettable but you accept it.\n\nNo, you're not the asshole. I am in this position with my nephew - I either don't buy anything or make the gift \"from everyone\". The fact I'm using my higher salary to buy things is completely invisible - I would *never* put parents in the position of your sister is placing you in.\n\nBut then again, I don't need children to specifically view me as \"better\" than their parents. That's the only motivation for her behavior, it's the only reason why it would be upsetting if she were deprived of the ability to attribute expensive gifts to herself.\n\nThe fact she has that unnatural need to be viewed as wealthy by children is not your fault, although she's sure making it your problem.", "NAH. Have you ever thought that giving is her love language? Also, have you ever thought that maybe she knows that you aren\u2019t as well off so she\u2019s spoiling your kids to spoil you? I lost my dog last year and got a new puppy, and last Christmas multiple people got me dog toys, treats, etc. I could have taken it as I wasn\u2019t being a good dog \u201cparent\u201d but figured they knew I was having a hard time and were covering the treats so I could cover the essentials. So, their plan was to take care of me. \nThat being said I could see where you might be a bit resentful, but you can absolutely teach the kids about how treats and special things are just that, special. And they wouldn\u2019t be as special if you have them every day. Maybe work with your sister on more reasonable expectations like seeing a movie or going out to eat instead of pricey items, or work with her to identify things that the kids would get the most use/enjoyment out of so she can still gift without making you feel like what you provide isn\u2019t good enough.

I can see that AITA now\u2026my sis is loaded and gives my kids cheap shit. \n\nYour kids are old enough to understand that Aunties don\u2019t have kids and love spoiling them every now and again, but they should realize that you don\u2019t have that kind of budget for luxury items, so they need to keep this in perspective and not demand things, even from Aunties. \n\nHow is this \u2018harmful\u2019 exactly? \n\nSorry but YTA.\n\nAnd also\u2026using your kids as leverage and threatening to cut her off in that slick way you did makes you the real ah here.", "Definitely NTA.", "YTA. Your sister wants to buy your kids expensive gifts they can\u2019t otherwise have, because she can, she enjoys it, and she thinks they do too. You threatened to cut her access to the kids if she didn\u2019t stop being generous to your kids. She apologized and said she\u2019ll stop. She was hurt by your threatening approach about not letting her spend time with them (which in my view clearly reflects your own insecurities about money). She agreed to your terms but was hurt and sad about what you said and how you said it, and she told her wife. Her wife thought surely you wouldn\u2019t have been so harsh with your sister if you knew you hurt her so much, so she told you that and asked you to apologize to your sister. Did I get that right?  How are you not TA?", "NTA. You could say that you're sorry she took your request as something hurtful, but it was a request you won't be backing down on because they're you're kids and it's YOU that has to cope with the fall-out.\n\nShe is literally trying to buy affection and maybe a bit of control over you, although I wouldn't say that. This never goes well. Tell her that giving gifts is lovely, and you appreciate it very much. But kids wreck things and fight over things and get jealous and expect the same again. So gifts should be cheap and cheerful unless you've sanctioned something bigger.", "YTA. I want to say you're not the asshole. I really do, but... You kinda are in this situation. I know it's hard, especially the kids behavior, but... Kids spend more time with you than they do their aunt.

I would just explain the situation, and make them understand that the gifts you give them are smaller but full of love, that you won't always be able to get them big aunty's gifts, and that this is okay.

This is more about you than your children. I sense that you feel some kind of guilt or shame at not being able to afford these things for your children, and it\u2019s manifesting against your sister. Your sister is child free, has disposable income, and wants to spoil your kids! While setting boundaries is ok, it sounds like you firmly shut down all gift giving without even acknowledging that what she was doing was out of love for her nieces and nephews. A more reasonable boundary might be that these gifts be restricted to occasions (birthday, Christmas, Easter, for my life\u2019s example, but whatever gifting holidays you practice) rather than it being a gift bonanza whenever auntie drops by.", "Nta but why wouldn't you apologize, it's your sister after all", "NTA, she was asked to stop before and kept doing it.

That was pretty harsh and probably wording for if she did it again after you set such a clear boundary.  You're allowed to set boundaries and limits.  While I agree with some people that the one being made to feel inferior is you, I don't think that makes you an AH.  YOU are the one who sees the changes in your kids, though, and if you don't think their aunt spoiling them is healthy, that is ABSOLUTELY your choice.", "NAH. You asked her to cut back, you didn't ask her not to buy gifts. Cut back isn't a clear instruction, so she's not an AH for buying a gift for your daughter after this initial conversation. \n\nYou're not an AH for setting boundaries on what you find acceptable for your children. \n\nBut you're depriving your children of nice things because you can't be bothered to work through the short patch of expectation this has caused in your kids. It is new for them, and it has confused their sense of money, but you just teach them that. And then they can have nice things and understand the  value of money... win win.", "NAH\nI was this aunt.  I genuinely meant well and because  I didn't live close to my niece and nephew, each time I visited, I showered them with whatever gifts they wanted.  My sister resented it and hid the gifts or showed disdain. I felt very hurt by what felt like rejection of how I expressed my love.  The final straw was when i got my 6yr old niece a very fine beautiful wool coat which i thought would be kind to her eczema prone skin and my sister just left the coat in the wardrobe never to be worn. That was 12 yrs ago. We came to an understanding, my unrestrained gifting has since been limited to birthdays and Christmas and literally never had any conflict since.

If she refuses and continues to do so she would be venturing into that territory but given what\u2019s happened here I don\u2019t think either of you are assholes. Just that she\u2019s sensitive.

Because I can't always afford to buy my kid expensive shit and my mom (he's her only grandchild) will spend hundreds or even a couple thousand on him during holidays, birthdays and random visits. Does it hurt me a bit that I can't be the one to do that? Yes, but why should my kid miss out on all those great things just because I can't buy them for him, if others can and are willing and happy to do it? \n\nI had a conversation with my child last holiday season (he is 6) and explained to him that the expensive presents came from grandma and aunty (because me and my husband are Santa) and that he has to be grateful but not spoiled. That is okay to enjoy his presents but not to expect presents like this 24/7. He understood and now if I say I can't afford it he'll say something along the lines of \"when I'm big I'm gonna work for a lot of money and I'm gonna get me one and get papi one too and you can share!\" (His dad is his favorite person) and that just melts my heart because it shows me I am raising a polite, kind and understanding child. So if my 6 y/o can understand this (trust me I sat for days looking for the right words so he would get it, he is a child and I have to break things down to his level of understanding) so could your children. \n\nSo NAH in my honest opinion.

I understand your point of view, but it strikes me that there's a simpler solution: when your kids start asking for shit you can't yourselves afford, tell them to ask their aunt.\n\nEither she'll buy them what they want, and the kids will be happy, or she'll realise that she's opened Pandora's (money)box, and cool it.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my family went from one extreme to the other. I remember the Christmas where we got stockings almost as long as we were tall stuffed with presents, **plus** then my dad wheeled us out a bicycle each. He had a carphone in like 1987. We had a boat even though we didn't actually live near the water.\n\n2 years later, everything was different. He lost his sizeable manufacturing business and ended up working for our neighbour's fencing business, we lost the boat, my mother ended up driving a car from the Sixties that had rear seatbelts crudely added with exposed bolts. They had to sell the house they'd built less than 5 years before and move us to another state when a friend offered my dad a job in his old industry.\n\nI'm not kidding when I say it took my parents 20 years and a lot of hard work and good fortune to get back to the point where they could buy a home again.\n\nI say all that to say this: your kids having stuff you can't afford doesn't mean they'll grow up not understanding the value of a dollar, thinking you're lesser compared to your sister and her wife, or whatever you're worried about.\n\nThat's going to come down to you making sure they understand that life is different for different people, they should be grateful for whatever they get from whomever they get it, and the importance of those who have much being generous to those who have little.\n\nI'm grateful to the friend who gave my father a job that allowed him to return to his industry (though I was miserable about having to move at the time, not understanding it at all). I'm grateful to my uncle and his friend for agreeing to invest the startup capital for my parents' new business a few years down the line.\n\nThese weren't even entirely altruistic gestures - the friend got a lot of great work out of my dad, and in fact the new business my parents started involved them buying part of his. My uncle and his friend did very well when the business eventually sold to a multinational, considering they were silent partners who did no work.\n\nSo, I understand you're concerned about the way your kids are acting now, but I think the better thing to do is to teach them to understand that these things can happen for them because of their aunt's generosity, and to be appropriately grateful that this is even possible.\n\nIdeally, if they understand the situation properly, it will mean they grow into adults who are willing to do the same for their relatives, should they have the opportunity.", "YTA \n\nThis isn\u2019t about how your kids feel, this is about how this makes you feel.

I understand the generous spirit, but I think there needs to be some healthy guidelines \u2014 and that is ultimately your choice as parents, no one else.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should necessarily cut her off completely, as that will just breed resentment all around. I don\u2019t even think you need to limit her overall spending *IF* there\u2019s an agreement that everyone respects. There is not a one-size-fits-all solution here. \n\nMaybe have a requirement that all gifts over $20/$50/$100 in a month or outside \u201cnormal\u201d gifting holidays (whatever makes sense for your family) must have an accompanying \u201cdonation\u201d of an equal amount to their college fund? And probably they need to also get your approval beforehand \u2014 no more surprise coats. It may at least cut the lavish gifts in half, and if not then at least they will have some extra money saved for college, trade school, or maybe even a down payment on a house\u2026the things that can actually make a huge difference in their life.\n\nDefinitely contact an accountant on the best way to send up those types of accounts, and you want to make it easy for family to contribute. I think my parents set some up for their grandchildren. If this isn\u2019t obvious, NEVER TOUCH THAT MONEY. I believe it\u2019s a special account similar to a retirement account with restrictions of withdrawals (but don\u2019t quote me on that). I believe there are tax benefits, too, or at least the recipient doesn\u2019t have to pay taxes once they get it? Again, please look into it. It\u2019s NOT a regular savings account.\n\nI\u2019ve definitely heard of parents making a conscious effort to not just buy toys and junk for gifts, as that all adds up over time. Toys especially can essentially be a waste of money a lot of the time, and a lot of it just ends up in the landfill. Many parents make contributions to college accounts, buy books and education gifts, take them to museums and zoos, etc. I agree that you don\u2019t want to raise entitled spoiled brats, and you need to proceed carefully so they don\u2019t blame everything on you. I think there is a happy medium to be found, and I hope you do!\n\nAs it stands, I\u2019m actually going to vote ESH because it sounds like there\u2019s a lot of necessary communication and boundaries that are simply not being done or made here. This is probably a relatively common occurrence for parents, and a good family therapist/counselor may be a good source of advice.\n\nPS: I heard something in a documentary that has stuck with me over the years. She said one way you can spot financial trouble is seeing a home filled with many \u201cthings\u201d (like toys, stuffed animals) but relatively few pieces of [quality] furniture. I\u2019m butchering the reference, but I think of the concept often. I\u2019m definitely in the camp of wanting fewer, but nicer, things\u2026and it\u2019s definitely something that takes WORK for me, and I\u2019m far from perfect.", "NTA, and neither is your sister. Your sister's wife meant well, but she's the AH here. You had a conversation with your sister in which you asked her to stop her behavior. Your sister apologized and said she would stop. The end, no drama.\n\nSister is emotionally sensitive. I am too, and I cry over *everything.* It's not an exaggeration, emotional impacts just make me cry, sooner or later. So sister held it together and then when she got home to her private residence with only her spouse, she cried and said her feelings were hurt. She confided in her wife-- as one typically would when they feel distress.\n\nOf course the wife should take your sister's side. Wouldn't you be upset if the situation was reversed and your husband took your sister's side? The wife presumably felt bad that her wife was upset and-- this is the AH bit-- called you to tell you that you suck. She should have stayed out of this and supported her wife quietly. She should have let the two of you continue working this out. It's annoying that she inserted herself into the situation, but when things have blown over a bit talk to your sister and tell her you were a little surprised the wife got involved. Say you thought you two had talked everything through, but encourage your sister to talk directly to you about her feelings.\n\nAlso, cut your SIL a little slack. It's hard to see the person we love upset and do nothing. She wanted to protect the person she loves.", "ESH. You seem to be jealous of your sisters wealth. She needs to learn to tone it down. \n\nBe appreciative that she wants to be involved and enjoys spoiling your kids. Maybe suggest that she starts taking the for experiences instead of gifts (aunts day for the art museum/zoo/theater) or start an education fund for each kid that she can throw money into when she wants to spoil them. But jeez, learn how to say thank you. Learn how to have the talk with your kids.", "NTA\n\nWell kinda.  Don't think the kids feel inferior though. Entitled maybe if they push you guys for things you can't afford.\n\nBeen there done that. Had to tell parents to stop or else would cut down time with them. Why because they had my DD saying she deserves it, to work harder because she wants it, even demanding from us and others what she wanted. \n\nShe was old enough to understand the difference but as a kid didn't care.\n\nTook her not getting things anymore from them and lots of talks and years for her to grow up enough to stop acting that way. She still got stuff but we put a dollar amount to how much they could buy per event. Now, she is an adult who understands money and what we did for her and is thankful. \n\nSo can't blame sister for how they act or feel so dont put that on her but can blame for not respecting you and the not to keep buying those things.", "I\u2019m going with YTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like your kids feel inferior but that you do. You feel bad you can\u2019t give them these things so you want them to not be able to get them at all. You could teach your kids that some people have more money than others and that auntie can afford those things but because you guys have more mouths to feed, they can\u2019t get those things regularly. They\u2019re going to grow up learning about wealth differences eventually. This is a great time to learn and also be grateful they have an aunt who loves them and is willing to get them those things when she can. If nothing else, you could\u2019ve at least been more kind when asking her to stop. You didn\u2019t even say thank you. She\u2019s clearly coming from a place of love.", "NTA you asked her politely to stop because its giving unreasonable gift expectations to your kids", "YTA you are jealous your kids get fancy gifts and you feel inferior because you cannot afford expensive things.", "YTA\nMy son was the first child, nephew, grandchildren for on mine and his father's side so he's been incredibly spoiled all his life. At no time ever was I bothered by the things he was given, quite the opposite in-fact. I was thrilled I didn't have to spend what I couldn't afford. This has less to do with your childrens reactions and more to do with your personal feelings. Your daughter can have a coat twice your rent as long as it fits her. You can teach her how to keep it up and emphasize how grateful everyone is for Auntie. You're doing fine. Your kids are fine without the things you cannot afford, but you should try to stop them from having nice things because you feel a way about not being able to provide them those nice things yourself.", "NTA\nYou need to have a proper chat with your sister about this. If she wants to spend lots of money on the kids then maybe she could set up a  educational fund for each of them and let her know what your budget is for your children and ask her yo spend within that limit. You also need to sit your children down and explain income and expenses to them so they don't keep asking fir expensive things.", "YTA. I would never put my pride before my children having nice things. If someone bought my children things that I couldn\u2019t afford, I\u2019d first and foremost be happy for my kids and grateful to that person. Sure maybe I\u2019d wish I could afford those things, but that would be the least important part of the equation. My kids come first.", "It\u2019s your job to teach your kids. If you teach them to be grateful that they have someone in their lives who loves them and can spoil them this way, and that most people wouldn\u2019t be able to afford these kinds of gifts, they could learn gratitude instead of entitlement. You don\u2019t do that because these gifts make you feel inferior. Not the kids, you. YTA.", "The way you did it, YTA.   \nYou\u2019re missing a great learning opportunity!  If Sis wants to spend $ on the kids, give her a framework she and the kids can work with. Include rules such as:    \n1. You must offer each kid the same predetermined amount that you will spend.    \n2. No surprises- collaborate with each kid on what they actually want and help them weigh the pros and cons of different options (one item vs. several less expensive ones, quality, usefulness, etc.).    \n3.  If there\u2019s any amount of their allotment left unspent, it is put into that child\u2019s piggy bank or a savings account with a plan to save up for something specific (child-chosen).", "YTA - why take away you're kids one avenue to experience things they otherwise can't, I'm not seeing how it affects your kids negatively, it affects YOU negatively.", "NAH, except maybe your SIL. Your sister is allowed to feel mildly upset over this and unless she was specifically intending to sick SIL on you, then she can express that upset to her wife. And you're of course, fully within your rights to ask what you asked.", "NTA. When my kiddos were young, I definitely overdid Christmas, as did the grandparents. One Christmas, when my oldest was 5, he opened at least 30 packages from mom, dad & all the relatives. He looked up at me, and asked-is that all? I was horrified. I then told all of the relatives that going forward, they were welcome to gift books, savings bonds, or cool tshirts from a vacay or their local area. I got a little push back, but then they realized it was so much easier. My parents did tend to gift one expensive gift for a birthday, and that was okay. Also now, I wish I had started an education acct (instead of the savings bonds). Both of my adult sons are amazing men, and I am so proud of them!", "NTA - you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I\u2019d definitely talk to her though because she was trying to be a nice aunt. \n\nMaybe suggest something more helpful like a college fund.", "I\u2019d start telling the kids exactly how much the gifts cost and then selling them with the children\u2019s permission and buying them a new gift and then putting the rest in a savings account for them.", "NTA.  I would also start selling them on eBay.  Money is better than useless crap.", "As a kid, I would've loved this aunt with all my life. Not because I felt like I was being bought but because it showed she actually cared. You're literally complaining that your sister that loves your kids and made a decision to treat them to something they otherwise would've never had to experience. I understand you can't afford it, but you're just acting like a jealous bitch to them because you can't do it for them. I'm sure you give them plenty of positive experiences within your budget but to treat your sister this way for trying to make your kids happy is just stupid.", "Yes exactly OP should bring her kids gift which are more than rent and next time gift them homelessness.", "I was going to say this...I understand her viewpoint, but it sounds like she worded it poorly. Also, a better angle would have been something like 'I love that you love the kids and spoil them, but it sets unrealistic expectations for them....can you save the big gifts for their birthdays and Christmas'?", "NTA. I would consider suggesting that instead of constantly showering then with material items, she not only dial it back, but put the difference into something lasting like a college if she still feels compelled to spend these levels on them.", "It is generally an AH move to give material possessions to children that the parents don't want you to give. So even if people think the OP is an AH, it should at least be an ESH situation. I don't understand the YTAs either.", "SIL asked for an apology, not to continue with the gift giving.

Let's go REALLY, unbelievably low. $600? You don't give a 12 or under year old a $1200 coat, and that's being overly generous.

If your sister isn't showing off or doesn't mention the cost, why do you feel the need to know it? \nIt seems like you have lots of insecurities when it comes to the financial difference between you and your sister. YTA, at some point you will have to teach your children about difference in finances, their friends will have things you cannot afford, what will you do then?

Rich and poor is relative to your social group, and if the OP's family mainly associate with people in their own financial level, the children probably used to think of themselves as \"normal\" not \"poor\". Then the rich aunt started with the over-the-top expensive gifts, and the kids started expecting them, and the parents had to explain to them that their family isn't as well-off as their aunt's. I doubt these children, who don't sound deprived to begin with, even thought they didn't deserve nice things, untill their parents had to explain to them that they can't afford luxury items.", "I'm wondering if the family is in subsidized housing. Rent can be very cheap if that is true.  When I worked with a nonprofit, some families were paying $100 a month in rent, in an expensive American city.", "Also, I'm calling BS on the coat that's DOUBLE their rent. You usually don't get over 1k unless it's a limited collection or really high-end designer. It's kind of crazy to think that the sister would drop that on a 12 year old that has a high likelihood of growing out of it. Maybe I'm wrong, but also if I was the sister I'd do something like this to send you a message that your out of touch emotionally with your children.", "OP clearly stated that her children weren't behaving well as a result if the gifts.\n\nThat is a completely reasonable reason to ask someone to stop giving kids presents.", "We have no idea how much rent is. I worked with families in subsidized rent programs who paid $100 in rent. A $200 coat isn't way out there for a good winter coat, unfortunately, especially with inflation.", "Giving your twelve-year-old niece a coat that is worth double her parents rent is not normal aunt/Uncle behavior.

Her parents are aware of the price that I paid for it, and I have offered to help them find similar things if they would like. They're OK with me being the one to give her big ticket items because it frees up money  Through the year for her needs and I can just get her big gifts on birthday and Christmas", "I understood this stuff when I was 5, it's not that hard?

I wouldn't need to do that, because any gifts to my kids would have to go through me first, and I would either allow the gift or not.  Otherwise, the gift is going back with strongly worded message.
