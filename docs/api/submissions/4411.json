{"id": 4411, "submission_id": "zi00fp", "title": "Update: AITA for introducing my boyfriend's parents as \"Grandma and Grandpa\" to my son?", "selftext": "People still seemed interested in my post about introducing my boyfriend Jay's parents to my son as \"grandma\" and \"grandpa.\" I thought I would update everyone on what happened. Immediately when I realized I was in the wrong, I called Jay and apologized for what happened. He told me he needed some space and wanted to take a break. I ended up calling his mother as well and apologized profusely. His mother forgave me and after I explained my reasoning said she didn't hold it against me. However, in retrospect, I think she was only being nice to me knowing her son was going to end the relationship. \n\nSpeaking of, Jay ended the relationship. I decided to take the advice given here about sitting down with jay and getting on the same page about our relationship. I also saw some of the comments here about taking a break = relationship ended, so I called Jay and told him that I wanted to talk sooner rather than later about this. We met yesterday, and while I feel our talk went well, It was really obvious to me that Jay was done with the relationship. He said that, while he always knew that me and my son were a packaged deal, he had not decided at that point if he was truly going to take on the \"dad\" role for my son. He felt like my interpreting his niceness and acceptance of my son as a fatherly role was a red flag for him overall, especially because we had never talked about it at all. He said that the real problem he had was me deciding that his parents were grandma and grandpa, without even talking to him about it. My original refusal to apologize and expecting him to as well were part of it as well. There are other things he brought up that I feel are beyond this issue anyway, so I'm going to leave them out. Many of the criticisms left on my original post lined up with what he said, so I can really say for certain I messed up big time. I apologized, But I knew there was really no hope of saving this so I didn't push when he said he felt like we should end the relationship. \n\nOverall, my last post made me realize that I really need to work on my own expectations for my partner and how he will fit into my son's life. I also really need to work on my own communication skills.", "created_utc": 1670697830, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zi00fp/update_aita_for_introducing_my_boyfriends_parents/", "score": 285, "replies": ["WOW -- You did some hard work and I applaud you for this.

Sorry to hear it was such a tough lesson.", "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z64yd5/aita_for_introducing_my_boyfriends_parents_as/)!", "Well, time to start anew then. And I guess this serves as a life lesson to not assume things about people\u2019s motivations.\n\nBut if it makes you feel any better, I think if \u201cJay\u201d really wanted a relationship with the genuine \u2018you\u2019, that would include the part of you that is your son. Not excusing how you messed up, because you did, but for the next time, you should look for someone who is willing to be that father figure to your son; because it is quite clear that you value that.", "Live and learn, don't jump in head first to the deep end. Let a relationship evolve and don't make assumptions about things you and your partner haven't discussed.", "Ooof! AWKWARD!\n\nI was a single mom and feel empathy.  You want to give your child what you think they're lacking.  I didn't get married until I was 36 and my son was 9.  I thought I was old and it was my last opportunity.  It is the single biggest regret of my life and my son's.  My ex-husband never bonded with my son and it was 6 years of misery for everyone.", "That post made me cringe so hard I turned inside out. thanks for the update OP, glad a lesson was learned. Please don't set up your kid for disappointment again.", "Thank you for the update.  I'm sorry this one didn't work out for you,  but congratulations on doing the hard work and introspection you needed to do to own your part in why\n\nMay you and your son find every happiness,  with or without the component that compliments, rather than completes, your team. You're already complete,  all on your own.", "Congrats on apologizing, i know that must be hard sometimes. This was a great lesson and going forward you will make better choices after taking a moment to think them through. Hopefully you will find someone who will fell in love with you and wanted to be a good fatherly role to your son, after all you two are package which isn't bad. Wish you all good moving forward.", "I remember your original post and I have to say I think you are an incredibly big person and it really gives me hope to see someone learn and grow. Your son is lucky to have you as a role model, and you two will find someone who is ready to be there for him and who will be lucky to have you both too", "It\u2019s my favorite thing to see people realize they were wrong and focus on not repeating those mistakes in the future.", "I'm glad you learned your lesson. Boundaries are so important. \n\nYour boyfriend wasn't a bad guy at all but I think you jumped the gun and that's what made him bail.. and I really don't blame him.  Btw there are many great supportive step dads out there who end up not taking the place of the child's living parent. They don't step into the role as father but step in the role as supportive adult\n\nI think it's a good idea to make sure you have babysitters in place so the next time you can have a relationship progress a little while before introducing your child into the mix. But I think a little break from dating over the holidays it would be good", "I'm glad you're taking lessons from this, but I'm just hoping that you take some time to actually be single. If you are rushing to find a husband and a father you're looking to fit a position not find a partner. \n\nYou should pause if you're in that place, and when you're ready wait a while before even introducing them to your kid and trying to fit them into your kid's life. Cuz it sounds like part of the problem here was that he was around too early and that's what led to the boundary getting confused", "As an Internet stranger who sees so many people, virtually as well as in person, unwilling to admit to their own faults, it\u2019s refreshing to see someone open to admitting there\u2019s room for improvement and change. All the best and stay humble!", "That's good for both of you. Now you can go on and find someone that's more in tune with what you want. I think it's great to just stay single and not rush into anything. Your son needs good role models, not necessarily a \"father figure\". Male relatives and friends that are kind and honest will work.", "Without sounding too harsh...this is probably the best outcome.. your ex had no intention of becoming a father figure for your son...and its your son who you should be putting first.\n\nTake some time away from the dating scene...and concentrate on you and your son.", "Op I recomend you to go to the stepparents sub\n\nPeople in this sub, sometimes, are too delusional and think that everything is black or white and thats not the case... \n\nIn that sub, you can read about the REAL experience of being a stepparent and learn from them.", "It is so gross that he had given it even a single thought to not take on a \u201cdad role\u201d to a child he\u2019d been with since they were 2.5 years old. Was he just going to ignore him for the next 14 years? Count your blessings.", "I applaud your honesty and self realization. Growth is always, at minimum uncomfortable, at worst, painful. Good on you.", "Good. \n\nAnd perhaps work on knowing the actual definitions of grandma and grandpa so you don\u2019t mess up in future.", "I'm not taking any sides here just curious.\n\nWhy did he stay with her for a year and a half if he wasn't that serious about her? Especially having a kid. How do you date a parent for that long and still not know if you want to be a step parent? This seems bizarre to me. Lots of people are starting to talk about marriage and a future a year and a half in. I'm so confused why she was so in the wrong here.", "Way to go, OP, you learned a lot, are being honest with yourself, and I bet you'll find someone who suits you more than Jay.", "Best of luck OP! I know this is hard and hurts but you are doing the right things to move forward. I'm really proud of you. And though losing this relationship hurts now, you are learning a lot from it, so I'm willing to bet that your next relationship has the potential to be really amazing after this.", "Live and learn girl. It sounds like you truly listened to everyone's concerns and are willing to work on expectations. Good for you.", "I'm so sorry that things played out for you the way they did. I guess I was hoping for a fairy tale ending for you. An old song goes \"Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, start all over again.\" Best of luck going forward.", "Please do not introduce a male figure \"partner\" to you son until you know deep in your heart that the individual is A) committed to you 1000% and B) committed to knowing and accepting your child as a package deal. If you get any reflags saying otherwise then they do not get to interact with your child.\n\nIt's unfair to introduce potential father figures to children only to have them waif away causing more hurt and sadness for your offspring :(", "I don't think yta for that assumption tbh, yeah you should have talked to him first to see if you were on the same page but who stays with a women with a child that long and has no idea of the roll he wants to play in yours and your child's life. I don't think he was intentionally leading you on but I don't think he loved you either to have not even given it any thought or consideration and still be in a relationship with you", "I am sorry your relationship ended. I do believe you and Jay were might not meant to be together. Your expectations were not on the same page and probably not even in the same book or in the same library. I hope the talk can help you with healing. I hope you will find a man that fits right in your life. Just don\u2019t let anyone in without a reason. Or a talk (but you know that now). Good luck for you in the future.", "I agree 100%. OP, good for you. You're learning and growing, which is the best all of us can do.  Kudos to you!", "All of this. Everyone makes mistakes. Not everyone learns from them. Don\u2019t beat yourself up, OP.", "What keeps coming to my mind is \"He's just not that into you\".  It may have zero to do with the child.  Jay was always in a more casual state of mind than OP.  Saying \"I don't want to be a dad\" may be true or an easy out.", "I would say to take this advice with caution if OP is reading it. For example, discussing the matter on the first date or on a dating app and expecting a positive soon after is a big ask. \n\nMost people will need to reflect. It may not be what they had in mind when they were looking for a partner, and that's okay. Honestly, wouldn't it be better knowing someone had given the idea some good consideration? Its a separate commitment, and that's why so many people wait to introduce their children.", "I don't think he wanted to exclude the son at all - a child calling your parents Grandma and Grandpa dials everything up to 11 and it was without prior discussion. That's a big leap\n\nIt's like a couple dating for two or three months and a woman spotting engagement rings in a shop window and telling her date which one she would like. It's not like he doesn't want to be with her but dang that's fast", "Yep. When kids are involved you need to have these serious discussions before telling your child to call someone their grandparents. Glad OP realises now", "Same. I hope their child isn\u2019t too confused", "They had only been together a year and a half.", "Yeah, and that\u2019s a possibility. For all we know, Jay regretted having a priority around his partner being another human being, and/or that he truly found out in that moment that he would prefer a more casual setup. \n\nAnd I totally get it from his view, if I can guess. It\u2019s difficult to walk into a relationship when the other person has a kid, and where, in the most ideal situation in respects to the kid\u2019s wellbeing, a strong priority is to raise this human being. You have to be in a certain mindset to be, and want to be, the other figure in a child\u2019s life; it\u2019s not for everyone. I am currently Jay\u2019s age, and although I want to be a dad one day, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be ready for a while still.\n\nBut yeah, overall, I just hope that OP finds what she\u2019s looking for in a potential partner, but **also, especially** not to just assume any man that gets along with you will be ok being the grown-up to a tiny human, especially at 25.", ">It may have zero to do with the child. Jay was always in a more casual state of mind than OP.\n\nIf this is true, then I think Jay does bare some (not all, but some) of the blame for introducing his parents to OP and her child at all.", "Naturally, you don\u2019t slam the \u201csingle mom\u201d schtick out on the table on the first date; that seems to be rather deep information that can wait as the person potentially develops interest in *you*. Of course, the opposite, of \u201chiding your kids\u2019 existence\u201d entirely, also seems like a bad idea because some people will simply never want to be near a kid ever.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure, from this experience, they\u2019ll exercise caution on shoehorning their kid\u2019s place into a potential future. I don\u2019t exactly know what you are expecting them to do with what I said? \ud83e\udd28", "Which would make the kid 2.5 when they met.", "OP and Jay were in completely different phases of their life - OP was significantly older than Jay who would have been 23 years old when he started the relationship - perhaps his first significant relationship and if he went to college, then it started just about when he graduated.\n\nReally based on OP's update and her growth and understanding, there really are no assholes here.\n\nBeing nice to a kid that you don't have any responsibility for is a fun thing to do - expecting a 23 or 24 year old guy to understand all of the ramifications and not get involved with a woman with a child - I don't think it is either OP or Jay's being assholes - just at very different stages and looking for very different things.\n\nIn my experience 29 year old women are generally starting to think about settling down permanently - more so than guys in that age group and more so than a 23 year old guy who generally isn't thinking about marriage and parenting at all.", "Perhaps.  You have give people some grace. They're both really young and at 29/ 25 it takes these kinds of situations to really drive home the importance of communication. \n\nWe're all out here trying to do our best and sometimes you gotta eat a shit sandwich.", "Come on, no matter how the situation goes, some people on here always find a way to put the blame on the man. It's getting old. There was absolutely no reason why OP should've addressed his parents as Grandma and Grandpa. That was a major overstep for anybody.", "It read like the advice was to go out looking for a potential father figure by searching for those who are keen from the bat. \n\nAlso, I'm CF and if single I would respect someone who came out on the first date with something like 'I've got a 4 year old boy at home. If that's not something you're looking for, let us just enjoy a good meal. If you're open to seeing me more, you have my number and we'll take things slow.'\n\nThat would work in general for OP's situation aswell. \n\nWaiting until a few dates in and them bringing up the child when you think they're attached to *you* is callous IMO. You could be wasting someone's time, they could genuinely like you, and then there is this big commitment they don't see being part of their life. \n\nI know a few people that have been tricked into liking people that way, not just about children but one guy didn't tell a friend until she'd fallen quite hard that he lives away for half the year.\n\nIf you've got something big, upfront is best.", "You can date someone for a year and a half with a kid and be nice to said kid but not ready to go into full dad mode. Stuff like that takes time. Plenty of folks don\u2019t even begin to talk marriage at a year and a half.", "4 years older is hardly \"significantly older\" and \"what the average person in X age group wants\" is irrelevant, because you are dating a specific person, not an average. I actually agree with your point that they were in completely different life stages, but I don't think 23 is too young to know what dating someone with kids means. He knew that he was dating a mother, he knew he was getting involved in a child's life. He wasn't an ah, but he was thoughtless and hopefully this will serve as a wake up call for him as well as the OP.", "I remember hearing about this woman telling her boyfriend that she doesn't have a child but a \"dog\". When he fell in love with her and wanted a future, she told him that her \"dog\" was really her daughter and she didn't want to lose him because he was CF and she hoped he'd eventually love the child. He left her because of her dishonesty. Some parents are so desperate that it's sad.", "My bad I thought you were questioning the math \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nThat said, it is weird to me that they would be in a relationship for a year and a half and never have a conversation about where it's going? If one person has a kid, that's something that's typically talked about early to establish how involved the other person wants to be, what the parent's priorities are, I've never dated a parent but my friends on dating apps who have ALL talk about that within a few months. \n\nBut OP did say she needs to work on expectations and communication, it seems like she didn't understand common protocol for dating as a single parent.", "Single parents date everyday, they aren't getting married to all of them. Besides that, the real issue is how she introduced his parents to her child. That was cruel and she should have known better.", "I think the real issue was just allowing your child to think of 2 people as his grandparents without discussing it before with the people involved. Insanely awkward thing to do and OP realises that now"]}
