{"id": 4411, "submission_id": "zi00fp", "title": "Update: AITA for introducing my boyfriend's parents as \"Grandma and Grandpa\" to my son?", "selftext": "People still seemed interested in my post about introducing my boyfriend Jay's parents to my son as \"grandma\" and \"grandpa.\" I thought I would update everyone on what happened. Immediately when I realized I was in the wrong, I called Jay and apologized for what happened. He told me he needed some space and wanted to take a break. I ended up calling his mother as well and apologized profusely. His mother forgave me and after I explained my reasoning said she didn't hold it against me. However, in retrospect, I think she was only being nice to me knowing her son was going to end the relationship. \n\nSpeaking of, Jay ended the relationship. I decided to take the advice given here about sitting down with jay and getting on the same page about our relationship. I also saw some of the comments here about taking a break = relationship ended, so I called Jay and told him that I wanted to talk sooner rather than later about this. We met yesterday, and while I feel our talk went well, It was really obvious to me that Jay was done with the relationship. He said that, while he always knew that me and my son were a packaged deal, he had not decided at that point if he was truly going to take on the \"dad\" role for my son. He felt like my interpreting his niceness and acceptance of my son as a fatherly role was a red flag for him overall, especially because we had never talked about it at all. He said that the real problem he had was me deciding that his parents were grandma and grandpa, without even talking to him about it. My original refusal to apologize and expecting him to as well were part of it as well. There are other things he brought up that I feel are beyond this issue anyway, so I'm going to leave them out. Many of the criticisms left on my original post lined up with what he said, so I can really say for certain I messed up big time. I apologized, But I knew there was really no hope of saving this so I didn't push when he said he felt like we should end the relationship. \n\nOverall, my last post made me realize that I really need to work on my own expectations for my partner and how he will fit into my son's life. I also really need to work on my own communication skills.", "created_utc": 1670697830, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zi00fp/update_aita_for_introducing_my_boyfriends_parents/", "score": 4265, "replies": ["WOW -- You did some hard work and I applaud you for this.

I'm sorry this one didn't work out for you,  but congratulations on doing the hard work and introspection you needed to do to own your part in why\n\nMay you and your son find every happiness,  with or without the component that compliments, rather than completes, your team.

Boundaries are so important. \n\nYour boyfriend wasn't a bad guy at all but I think you jumped the gun and that's what made him bail.. and I really don't blame him.  Btw there are many great supportive step dads out there who end up not taking the place of the child's living parent. They don't step into the role as father but step in the role as supportive adult\n\nI think it's a good idea to make sure you have babysitters in place so the next time you can have a relationship progress a little while before introducing your child into the mix. But I think a little break from dating over the holidays it would be good", "I'm glad you're taking lessons from this, but I'm just hoping that you take some time to actually be single. If you are rushing to find a husband and a father you're looking to fit a position not find a partner. \n\nYou should pause if you're in that place, and when you're ready wait a while before even introducing them to your kid and trying to fit them into your kid's life.

All the best and stay humble!", "That's good for both of you. Now you can go on and find someone that's more in tune with what you want. I think it's great to just stay single and not rush into anything. Your son needs good role models, not necessarily a \"father figure\". Male relatives and friends that are kind and honest will work.", "Without sounding too harsh...this is probably the best outcome.. your ex had no intention of becoming a father figure for your son...and its your son who you should be putting first.\n\nTake some time away from the dating scene...and concentrate on you and your son.", "Op I recomend you to go to the stepparents sub\n\nPeople in this sub, sometimes, are too delusional and think that everything is black or white and thats not the case... \n\nIn that sub, you can read about the REAL experience of being a stepparent and learn from them.", "It is so gross that he had given it even a single thought to not take on a \u201cdad role\u201d to a child he\u2019d been with since they were 2.5 years old.

Especially having a kid. How do you date a parent for that long and still not know if you want to be a step parent? This seems bizarre to me. Lots of people are starting to talk about marriage and a future a year and a half in.

I know this is hard and hurts but you are doing the right things to move forward. I'm really proud of you.

Not everyone learns from them. Don\u2019t beat yourself up, OP.", "What keeps coming to my mind is \"He's just not that into you\".  It may have zero to do with the child.  Jay was always in a more casual state of mind than OP.  Saying \"I don't want to be a dad\" may be true or an easy out.", "I would say to take this advice with caution if OP is reading it. For example, discussing the matter on the first date or on a dating app and expecting a positive soon after is a big ask. \n\nMost people will need to reflect. It may not be what they had in mind when they were looking for a partner, and that's okay. Honestly, wouldn't it be better knowing someone had given the idea some good consideration? Its a separate commitment, and that's why so many people wait to introduce their children.", "I don't think he wanted to exclude the son at all - a child calling your parents Grandma and Grandpa dials everything up to 11 and it was without prior discussion. That's a big leap\n\nIt's like a couple dating for two or three months and a woman spotting engagement rings in a shop window and telling her date which one she would like. It's not like he doesn't want to be with her but dang that's fast", "Yep. When kids are involved you need to have these serious discussions before telling your child to call someone their grandparents. Glad OP realises now", "Same. I hope their child isn\u2019t too confused", "They had only been together a year and a half.", "Yeah, and that\u2019s a possibility. For all we know, Jay regretted having a priority around his partner being another human being, and/or that he truly found out in that moment that he would prefer a more casual setup. \n\nAnd I totally get it from his view, if I can guess. It\u2019s difficult to walk into a relationship when the other person has a kid, and where, in the most ideal situation in respects to the kid\u2019s wellbeing, a strong priority is to raise this human being. You have to be in a certain mindset to be, and want to be, the other figure in a child\u2019s life; it\u2019s not for everyone. I am currently Jay\u2019s age, and although I want to be a dad one day, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be ready for a while still.\n\nBut yeah, overall, I just hope that OP finds what she\u2019s looking for in a potential partner, but **also, especially** not to just assume any man that gets along with you will be ok being the grown-up to a tiny human, especially at 25.", ">It may have zero to do with the child. Jay was always in a more casual state of mind than OP.\n\nIf this is true, then I think Jay does bare some (not all, but some) of the blame for introducing his parents to OP and her child at all.", "Naturally, you don\u2019t slam the \u201csingle mom\u201d schtick out on the table on the first date; that seems to be rather deep information that can wait as the person potentially develops interest in *you*. Of course, the opposite, of \u201chiding your kids\u2019 existence\u201d entirely, also seems like a bad idea because some people will simply never want to be near a kid ever.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure, from this experience, they\u2019ll exercise caution on shoehorning their kid\u2019s place into a potential future. I don\u2019t exactly know what you are expecting them to do with what I said? \ud83e\udd28", "Which would make the kid 2.5 when they met.", "OP and Jay were in completely different phases of their life - OP was significantly older than Jay who would have been 23 years old when he started the relationship - perhaps his first significant relationship and if he went to college, then it started just about when he graduated.\n\nReally based on OP's update and her growth and understanding, there really are no assholes here.\n\nBeing nice to a kid that you don't have any responsibility for is a fun thing to do - expecting a 23 or 24 year old guy to understand all of the ramifications and not get involved with a woman with a child - I don't think it is either OP or Jay's being assholes - just at very different stages and looking for very different things.\n\nIn my experience 29 year old women are generally starting to think about settling down permanently - more so than guys in that age group and more so than a 23 year old guy who generally isn't thinking about marriage and parenting at all.", "Perhaps.  You have give people some grace. They're both really young and at 29/ 25 it takes these kinds of situations to really drive home the importance of communication. \n\nWe're all out here trying to do our best and sometimes you gotta eat a shit sandwich.", "Come on, no matter how the situation goes, some people on here always find a way to put the blame on the man. It's getting old. There was absolutely no reason why OP should've addressed his parents as Grandma and Grandpa. That was a major overstep for anybody.", "It read like the advice was to go out looking for a potential father figure by searching for those who are keen from the bat. \n\nAlso, I'm CF and if single I would respect someone who came out on the first date with something like 'I've got a 4 year old boy at home. If that's not something you're looking for, let us just enjoy a good meal. If you're open to seeing me more, you have my number and we'll take things slow.'\n\nThat would work in general for OP's situation aswell. \n\nWaiting until a few dates in and them bringing up the child when you think they're attached to *you* is callous IMO. You could be wasting someone's time, they could genuinely like you, and then there is this big commitment they don't see being part of their life. \n\nI know a few people that have been tricked into liking people that way, not just about children but one guy didn't tell a friend until she'd fallen quite hard that he lives away for half the year.\n\nIf you've got something big, upfront is best.", "You can date someone for a year and a half with a kid and be nice to said kid but not ready to go into full dad mode. Stuff like that takes time. Plenty of folks don\u2019t even begin to talk marriage at a year and a half.", "4 years older is hardly \"significantly older\" and \"what the average person in X age group wants\" is irrelevant, because you are dating a specific person, not an average. I actually agree with your point that they were in completely different life stages, but I don't think 23 is too young to know what dating someone with kids means. He knew that he was dating a mother, he knew he was getting involved in a child's life. He wasn't an ah, but he was thoughtless and hopefully this will serve as a wake up call for him as well as the OP.", "I remember hearing about this woman telling her boyfriend that she doesn't have a child but a \"dog\". When he fell in love with her and wanted a future, she told him that her \"dog\" was really her daughter and she didn't want to lose him because he was CF and she hoped he'd eventually love the child. He left her because of her dishonesty. Some parents are so desperate that it's sad.", "My bad I thought you were questioning the math \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nThat said, it is weird to me that they would be in a relationship for a year and a half and never have a conversation about where it's going? If one person has a kid, that's something that's typically talked about early to establish how involved the other person wants to be, what the parent's priorities are, I've never dated a parent but my friends on dating apps who have ALL talk about that within a few months. \n\nBut OP did say she needs to work on expectations and communication, it seems like she didn't understand common protocol for dating as a single parent.", "Single parents date everyday, they aren't getting married to all of them. Besides that, the real issue is how she introduced his parents to her child. That was cruel and she should have known better.", "I think the real issue was just allowing your child to think of 2 people as his grandparents without discussing it before with the people involved. Insanely awkward thing to do and OP realises that now", "You definitely made the situation really awkward and uncomfortable with the grandparent situation. I'm sure the parents were super uncomfortable. BUT -\n\nI think I'll get hate for this, but honestly I consider your ex to an AH in general to the situation.\n\n1.5 years is way too much time for a guy to be dating a single mom and spending time in a fatherly role to your son without him having decided if he was ok being a step-father and wanting to be with a single mom. That's especially true for a young child and no father in the picture.\n\nYou need to be very clear with future dating partners what you are looking for and that you are a package deal.", "I\u2019m sure this hurts but hopefully it\u2019ll help you grow and find an even better relationship", "I really appreciate how you've handled this, and yourself.

You have great qualities.", "You learned, grew, and will be wiser in the future; I wish you the best of luck going forward.", "It says a lot about your character that you took this hard message on board and grew from it. A lot of people would still be stomping their feet and defending their actions. If this is how your kid sees you handle setbacks, he\u2019s got a great role model. All the best to both of you!", "This is so refreshing to see- most AHs delete when it becomes obvious they're the AH, so it's nice to see someone who took input to heart. I'm sorry about your relationship, hopefully this allows you to be better prepared for these situations in the future.", "Good for you on using this to learn.

I wish you all the best.", "Well, this is not acting like an asshole. This is acting like a mature, sensible, positive person. You are setting a very good example for your son by admitting to your faults and striving to do better. It's a great thing.\n\nI am truly sorry to hear that your relationship is over. That really stinks. But I hope that even better things are in your future and your son's future.\n\n You are not an asshole!", "Well done I know this would have been hard to write. In future it should be a conversation early on with men you date that there will be an expectation of step-parenting if there is a long term future between you. Never introduce your son to someone you date who isn\u2019t on board with that.\n\nIt is much harder to date as a single parent, but as long as you\u2019re upfront about what you are looking for, it will weed out the people who are not right for you or wasting your time. It goes without saying your son has to be priority throughout your romantic endeavours.", "Wow, I\u2019m proud of you, OP.  You messed up, owned it, dealt with the fallout, and are making adjustments for the future.  That takes a great deal of maturity.  I\u2019m sorry the relationship didn\u2019t work out but I think your partner is still out there.  Good luck!", "Wishing you and your son all the best.

I read and commented on your original post. Reading this update is spectacular! You're on the right path, keep at it! <3", "Mad respect for you OP on the personal growth", "Any update on your son? Because frankly the damage done to the relationship by introducing them as grandparents is so secondary to the damage done to your son being told he people are his grandparents when they\u2019re not.

I think one thing OP needs to realize and has hopefully learned from this is that having a kid just slows the relationship down. At least, it should. The guy isn\u2019t just getting to know you. He\u2019s getting to know you AND your child. Part of deciding if he wants a serious relationship with you is also deciding if he wants kids\u2014and wants one immediately. And you both have to try to navigate this without getting your child\u2019s hopes up too high too soon. And all of that has to be settled before you start introducing his family as a permanent part of your child\u2019s life. \n\nIt just takes time. And that\u2019s okay! OP, you will find someone to love and cherish you and your son, but you need to realize that a whirlwind romance would not be in your son\u2019s best interest. Take your time with future guys. Make sure you know who they are and how they will treat you and your baby before you start calling them family. It will be slow, but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be good. The best loves are built brick by brick into a solid foundation that will last a lifetime.", "It's actually simple and there's nothing complicated about this mess. His parents never met the child, she barely knows his parents and she didn't tell the bf how she planned on introducing her child to his parents. That would weird anyone out, also parents stay in relationships without getting married everyday. She should have talked to Jay first. She was wrong.", "Agreed. She was the AH for that specific situation, but 1.5 years is way too long to be with a single mom who had a 2.5 year old when you met (and is now 4) and not know if you want to be his step-father.", "Lmao", "You missed the entire point. OP barely knew his parents and her child never met them. In what world would it be ok to refer to them as Grandparents especially since they never talked about marriage or telling her ex bf beforehand?

That\u2019s wild too me", "I cringe over stuff I said half an hour ago. C\u2019est la vie.", "This made me laugh....& I understand.", "Learning is a life long experience.", "Omg it's like this is what happens when you don't communicate and assume.", "There's a (fairly reasonable) double standard when it comes to step-parents of minor children. They are expected to love the children and take on a parental role. The children aren't required to love them or see them as parents. \n\nThis is reasonable because it's the adult's choice if they want to get into a relationship that is going to require them to act as a parental figure to kids. It's much less the child's choice if they want a stepparent. \n\nHaving the boyfriend be prepared to act in the role of a father figure to the kid doesn't mean that either OP or the boyfriend would be pushing the kid to accept the boyfriend as a replacement father.", "They don't live together. He is most likely not contributing financially to raising the kid, he is unlikely to be the emergency contact for school/daycare, he's not responsible for taking off work if the kid is sick or arranging his work schedule to make it work with kid drop off/pick up, he's likely not organizing birthday parties and playdates, etc. \n\nI have friends who have consistently seen my kids grow up and that doesn't make them anywhere near being parents. From the kid's perspective, a boyfriend who doesn't live with mom probably ranks on the same level as any of mom's friends she sees regularly. \n\nObviously, the mom needs to be thoughtful about how she's raising her kid and what ideas she's putting in his head about family and there is lots of room to mess things up at this age.", "It seems when she introduced the kid to his parents as \u201cgrandma and grandpa\u201d she pushed her narrative.  It\u2019s seems in this the feed the step parent could when been with the spouse for 20 years and it\u2019s ok to not look at them like a parent but the bf in this case is being questioned for a 2 years relationship and he not ready for the title weight of step parent. I don\u2019t think she or he is wrong. I just noted a double standard.", "Jay did you a favor. He clearly wasn't ready or wanting to take a role as step-dad. And it seems based on this reaction of his, he was on the way out the door anyway.", "I just don\u2019t understand when people with kids start dating people who don\u2019t want to take on a fatherly role. This would be cleared up for me on the first date.", "Wow you are a rockstar.  You learned a lesson.  And are now a better person for yourself, your child, and everyone else around you.  You didn't lose a relationship, you gained a valuable insight on yourself.  I applaud you.", "Hugs!  It's all  a part of learning.  Very mature of you.", "Congratulations on some incredible self awareness. Best of luck to you. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. It just seems that you weren\u2019t on the same page. It happens. Maybe you jumped the gun a little bit, but sometimes, you just don\u2019t know, until you\u2018re in the middle of a relationship. It takes time . Don\u2019t beat yourself up over it. Move on, let it go. He wasn\u2019t the right guy. You\u2019ll find the ONE.", "Some relationships are lessons, some are blessings!\n\n\nGood on you for your growth. \n\n\nI'm sure you'll take the lessons you've learned into the next relationship you have, and it will be more long term and serious because of it.\n\n\nI wish you and your son the best OP \u2764\ufe0f", "You did mess up, but honestly bullet dodged. I couldn\u2019t imagine being as young as your son, growing up with an adult who wanted no parental role on my life. Sounds like your needs just weren\u2019t compatible, and that\u2019s OK.", "This is so sad. I'm sorry this mistake cost you so much but I'm glad will inform your future behavior. We get stronger through adversity.", "That's some incredible personal growth. I'm sorry it didn't work our with Jay, but you are really awesome how you have learnt from this. I wish more people had this ability to take criticism and use it to be more awesome.", "I\u2019m just worried for your don. I hope he didn\u2019t get too attached to the idea of your ex\u2019s parents being his grandparents.", "I came to say that in our culture older people after a certain age, no matter your relationship to them is addressed as Grandpa and Grandma", "Sometimes you get to learn things the hard way. It sucks and you have my sympathy but it sounds like you used this as a learning experience which is great.", "I didn't even read your original post, but it sounds to me like you have swallowed some big chunks of truth about yourself. Well done. I'm sure that you won't make the same mistakes again.", "True, this is a typical Reddit IATA thing, seeing everything one dimensional and black and white, when a real life situation is very rarely that. OP made a mistake but so did her ex boyfriend.", "I can't imagine dating as a single parent is easy. OP made a mistake that cost her, but in the end we're only human. I hope she has better luck next time.", "If I remember correctly he\u2019s rather young (25 or younger ) so his age probably had something to do with his line of thinking. He wasn\u2019t looking to settle down, even though he was dating a single mom.

You the OP's ex or something?", "Even worse", "Thank your lucky stars. Why would you want to be with someone who doesn't love your son as a son?  You don't need someone wishy washy like that in your life. He would be a terrible influence on your son. Find yourself a good man who will love you and your son. There are men out there who will love him as if he were their own. That loser Jay can find himself someone else too.", "Thank you for the update! I think it takes a lot of self awareness to recognize and accept you made a mistake but you can also choose to look at it as a much needed lesson  so that you dont make a similar mistake with another partner with whom you'd like to take it to another serious level. Dont dwell on this lesson as you probably already learned what you had to learn from it. Seems you are on the right track and taking your time to really reflect on how you can come out being a better person/mother out of this.", "Not at all! I introduced my daughter to my husband's (then boyfriends) parents as grandma and grandpa because all the children called them that. They thought it was endearing.  If they don't,  they may not make good \"step\" grandparents in the future.\nMy inlaws used to brag my daughter was their \"Bonus Grandchild\" because she came potty trained, able to dress herself and was ready to enjoy and love without any work!", "Good for you.

It takes even more to reach out and apologize after time has passed.\nI can see you had some personal growth and did a lot of thinking about what you need to work on and what you want in life.\nI wish you the best. And a good partner, who will be the person that you and your son need.", "Congrats on apologizing to them and thank you for providing us with an update! It seems like you really understand where you went wrong and that you and Jay were able to have a mature conversation as adults. Your post here is very mature and I was happy to see the learning experience here.", "This would have been hard for me to judge because in my culture you would call older people grandma and grandpa or uncle and aunty regardless of relation, even if they were just the next door neighbor. Their many cultures that are like they too, so I couldn't see why it was crossing the boundary, but I guess I'm a western lens that's very different since you don't call someone so familiarly as a sign of respect. Western culture can be so weird to me at times because there are so many boundary rules that are specific that western society.", "meanwhile in the dating section of reddit.....\n\n\n\nsingle mothers: why won't men date single mothers?? \n\n\n\n\nAnswer: this topic is example of why. \ud83e\udd23 \n\n\n\ni am going to start linking to this topic whenever i see single mothers complaining about how men won't date them.", "proud of you for growing op! hopefully one dey you\u2019ll find someone who is excited to be a father for your son!", "Even then, if you are wishy washy on something that important, maybe bring the girlfriend to meet your parents, but not the kid.

An adult chooses to become a step-parent and navigate how they feel about things, and in two years it should have been a conversation for both OP and ex.\n\nBUT, the kids are never assholes for being kids.", "Agree"]}
