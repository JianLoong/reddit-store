{"id": 4411, "submission_id": "zi00fp", "title": "Update: AITA for introducing my boyfriend's parents as \"Grandma and Grandpa\" to my son?", "selftext": "People still seemed interested in my post about introducing my boyfriend Jay's parents to my son as \"grandma\" and \"grandpa.\" I thought I would update everyone on what happened. Immediately when I realized I was in the wrong, I called Jay and apologized for what happened. He told me he needed some space and wanted to take a break. I ended up calling his mother as well and apologized profusely. His mother forgave me and after I explained my reasoning said she didn't hold it against me. However, in retrospect, I think she was only being nice to me knowing her son was going to end the relationship. \n\nSpeaking of, Jay ended the relationship. I decided to take the advice given here about sitting down with jay and getting on the same page about our relationship. I also saw some of the comments here about taking a break = relationship ended, so I called Jay and told him that I wanted to talk sooner rather than later about this. We met yesterday, and while I feel our talk went well, It was really obvious to me that Jay was done with the relationship. He said that, while he always knew that me and my son were a packaged deal, he had not decided at that point if he was truly going to take on the \"dad\" role for my son. He felt like my interpreting his niceness and acceptance of my son as a fatherly role was a red flag for him overall, especially because we had never talked about it at all. He said that the real problem he had was me deciding that his parents were grandma and grandpa, without even talking to him about it. My original refusal to apologize and expecting him to as well were part of it as well. There are other things he brought up that I feel are beyond this issue anyway, so I'm going to leave them out. Many of the criticisms left on my original post lined up with what he said, so I can really say for certain I messed up big time. I apologized, But I knew there was really no hope of saving this so I didn't push when he said he felt like we should end the relationship. \n\nOverall, my last post made me realize that I really need to work on my own expectations for my partner and how he will fit into my son's life. I also really need to work on my own communication skills.", "created_utc": 1670697830, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zi00fp/update_aita_for_introducing_my_boyfriends_parents/", "score": 2052, "replies": ["WOW -- You did some hard work and I applaud you for this.

You want to give your child what you think they're lacking.  I didn't get married until I was 36 and my son was 9.  I thought I was old and it was my last opportunity.

I'm sorry this one didn't work out for you,  but congratulations on doing the hard work and introspection you needed to do to own your part in why\n\nMay you and your son find every happiness,  with or without the component that compliments, rather than completes, your team.

Boundaries are so important. \n\nYour boyfriend wasn't a bad guy at all but I think you jumped the gun and that's what made him bail.. and I really don't blame him.  Btw there are many great supportive step dads out there who end up not taking the place of the child's living parent. They don't step into the role as father but step in the role as supportive adult\n\nI think it's a good idea to make sure you have babysitters in place so the next time you can have a relationship progress a little while before introducing your child into the mix. But I think a little break from dating over the holidays it would be good", "I'm glad you're taking lessons from this, but I'm just hoping that you take some time to actually be single. If you are rushing to find a husband and a father you're looking to fit a position not find a partner. \n\nYou should pause if you're in that place, and when you're ready wait a while before even introducing them to your kid and trying to fit them into your kid's life.

All the best and stay humble!", "That's good for both of you. Now you can go on and find someone that's more in tune with what you want. I think it's great to just stay single and not rush into anything. Your son needs good role models, not necessarily a \"father figure\". Male relatives and friends that are kind and honest will work.", "Without sounding too harsh...this is probably the best outcome.. your ex had no intention of becoming a father figure for your son...and its your son who you should be putting first.\n\nTake some time away from the dating scene...and concentrate on you and your son.", "Op I recomend you to go to the stepparents sub\n\nPeople in this sub, sometimes, are too delusional and think that everything is black or white and thats not the case... \n\nIn that sub, you can read about the REAL experience of being a stepparent and learn from them.", "It is so gross that he had given it even a single thought to not take on a \u201cdad role\u201d to a child he\u2019d been with since they were 2.5 years old.

Especially having a kid. How do you date a parent for that long and still not know if you want to be a step parent? This seems bizarre to me. Lots of people are starting to talk about marriage and a future a year and a half in. I'm so confused why she was so in the wrong here.", "Way to go, OP, you learned a lot, are being honest with yourself, and I bet you'll find someone who suits you more than Jay.", "Best of luck OP! I know this is hard and hurts but you are doing the right things to move forward. I'm really proud of you.

Not everyone learns from them. Don\u2019t beat yourself up, OP.", "What keeps coming to my mind is \"He's just not that into you\".  It may have zero to do with the child.  Jay was always in a more casual state of mind than OP.  Saying \"I don't want to be a dad\" may be true or an easy out.", "I would say to take this advice with caution if OP is reading it. For example, discussing the matter on the first date or on a dating app and expecting a positive soon after is a big ask. \n\nMost people will need to reflect. It may not be what they had in mind when they were looking for a partner, and that's okay. Honestly, wouldn't it be better knowing someone had given the idea some good consideration? Its a separate commitment, and that's why so many people wait to introduce their children.", "I don't think he wanted to exclude the son at all - a child calling your parents Grandma and Grandpa dials everything up to 11 and it was without prior discussion. That's a big leap\n\nIt's like a couple dating for two or three months and a woman spotting engagement rings in a shop window and telling her date which one she would like. It's not like he doesn't want to be with her but dang that's fast", "Yep. When kids are involved you need to have these serious discussions before telling your child to call someone their grandparents. Glad OP realises now", "Same. I hope their child isn\u2019t too confused", "They had only been together a year and a half.", "Yeah, and that\u2019s a possibility. For all we know, Jay regretted having a priority around his partner being another human being, and/or that he truly found out in that moment that he would prefer a more casual setup. \n\nAnd I totally get it from his view, if I can guess. It\u2019s difficult to walk into a relationship when the other person has a kid, and where, in the most ideal situation in respects to the kid\u2019s wellbeing, a strong priority is to raise this human being. You have to be in a certain mindset to be, and want to be, the other figure in a child\u2019s life; it\u2019s not for everyone. I am currently Jay\u2019s age, and although I want to be a dad one day, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be ready for a while still.\n\nBut yeah, overall, I just hope that OP finds what she\u2019s looking for in a potential partner, but **also, especially** not to just assume any man that gets along with you will be ok being the grown-up to a tiny human, especially at 25.", ">It may have zero to do with the child. Jay was always in a more casual state of mind than OP.\n\nIf this is true, then I think Jay does bare some (not all, but some) of the blame for introducing his parents to OP and her child at all.", "Naturally, you don\u2019t slam the \u201csingle mom\u201d schtick out on the table on the first date; that seems to be rather deep information that can wait as the person potentially develops interest in *you*. Of course, the opposite, of \u201chiding your kids\u2019 existence\u201d entirely, also seems like a bad idea because some people will simply never want to be near a kid ever.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure, from this experience, they\u2019ll exercise caution on shoehorning their kid\u2019s place into a potential future. I don\u2019t exactly know what you are expecting them to do with what I said? \ud83e\udd28", "Which would make the kid 2.5 when they met.", "OP and Jay were in completely different phases of their life - OP was significantly older than Jay who would have been 23 years old when he started the relationship - perhaps his first significant relationship and if he went to college, then it started just about when he graduated.\n\nReally based on OP's update and her growth and understanding, there really are no assholes here.\n\nBeing nice to a kid that you don't have any responsibility for is a fun thing to do - expecting a 23 or 24 year old guy to understand all of the ramifications and not get involved with a woman with a child - I don't think it is either OP or Jay's being assholes - just at very different stages and looking for very different things.\n\nIn my experience 29 year old women are generally starting to think about settling down permanently - more so than guys in that age group and more so than a 23 year old guy who generally isn't thinking about marriage and parenting at all.", "Perhaps.  You have give people some grace. They're both really young and at 29/ 25 it takes these kinds of situations to really drive home the importance of communication. \n\nWe're all out here trying to do our best and sometimes you gotta eat a shit sandwich.", "Come on, no matter how the situation goes, some people on here always find a way to put the blame on the man. It's getting old. There was absolutely no reason why OP should've addressed his parents as Grandma and Grandpa. That was a major overstep for anybody.", "It read like the advice was to go out looking for a potential father figure by searching for those who are keen from the bat. \n\nAlso, I'm CF and if single I would respect someone who came out on the first date with something like 'I've got a 4 year old boy at home. If that's not something you're looking for, let us just enjoy a good meal. If you're open to seeing me more, you have my number and we'll take things slow.'\n\nThat would work in general for OP's situation aswell. \n\nWaiting until a few dates in and them bringing up the child when you think they're attached to *you* is callous IMO. You could be wasting someone's time, they could genuinely like you, and then there is this big commitment they don't see being part of their life. \n\nI know a few people that have been tricked into liking people that way, not just about children but one guy didn't tell a friend until she'd fallen quite hard that he lives away for half the year.\n\nIf you've got something big, upfront is best.", "You can date someone for a year and a half with a kid and be nice to said kid but not ready to go into full dad mode. Stuff like that takes time. Plenty of folks don\u2019t even begin to talk marriage at a year and a half.", "4 years older is hardly \"significantly older\" and \"what the average person in X age group wants\" is irrelevant, because you are dating a specific person, not an average. I actually agree with your point that they were in completely different life stages, but I don't think 23 is too young to know what dating someone with kids means. He knew that he was dating a mother, he knew he was getting involved in a child's life. He wasn't an ah, but he was thoughtless and hopefully this will serve as a wake up call for him as well as the OP.", "I remember hearing about this woman telling her boyfriend that she doesn't have a child but a \"dog\". When he fell in love with her and wanted a future, she told him that her \"dog\" was really her daughter and she didn't want to lose him because he was CF and she hoped he'd eventually love the child. He left her because of her dishonesty. Some parents are so desperate that it's sad.", "My bad I thought you were questioning the math \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nThat said, it is weird to me that they would be in a relationship for a year and a half and never have a conversation about where it's going? If one person has a kid, that's something that's typically talked about early to establish how involved the other person wants to be, what the parent's priorities are, I've never dated a parent but my friends on dating apps who have ALL talk about that within a few months. \n\nBut OP did say she needs to work on expectations and communication, it seems like she didn't understand common protocol for dating as a single parent.", "Single parents date everyday, they aren't getting married to all of them. Besides that, the real issue is how she introduced his parents to her child. That was cruel and she should have known better.", "I think the real issue was just allowing your child to think of 2 people as his grandparents without discussing it before with the people involved. Insanely awkward thing to do and OP realises that now", "You definitely made the situation really awkward and uncomfortable with the grandparent situation. I'm sure the parents were super uncomfortable. BUT -\n\nI think I'll get hate for this, but honestly I consider your ex to an AH in general to the situation.\n\n1.5 years is way too much time for a guy to be dating a single mom and spending time in a fatherly role to your son without him having decided if he was ok being a step-father and wanting to be with a single mom. That's especially true for a young child and no father in the picture.\n\nYou need to be very clear with future dating partners what you are looking for and that you are a package deal.", "I\u2019m sure this hurts but hopefully it\u2019ll help you grow and find an even better relationship", "I really appreciate how you've handled this, and yourself.

You have great qualities.", "You learned, grew, and will be wiser in the future; I wish you the best of luck going forward.", "It says a lot about your character that you took this hard message on board and grew from it. A lot of people would still be stomping their feet and defending their actions. If this is how your kid sees you handle setbacks, he\u2019s got a great role model. All the best to both of you!", "This is so refreshing to see- most AHs delete when it becomes obvious they're the AH, so it's nice to see someone who took input to heart. I'm sorry about your relationship, hopefully this allows you to be better prepared for these situations in the future.", "Good for you on using this to learn.

I wish you all the best.", "Well, this is not acting like an asshole. This is acting like a mature, sensible, positive person. You are setting a very good example for your son by admitting to your faults and striving to do better. It's a great thing.\n\nI am truly sorry to hear that your relationship is over. That really stinks. But I hope that even better things are in your future and your son's future.\n\n You are not an asshole!", "Well done I know this would have been hard to write. In future it should be a conversation early on with men you date that there will be an expectation of step-parenting if there is a long term future between you. Never introduce your son to someone you date who isn\u2019t on board with that.\n\nIt is much harder to date as a single parent, but as long as you\u2019re upfront about what you are looking for, it will weed out the people who are not right for you or wasting your time. It goes without saying your son has to be priority throughout your romantic endeavours.", "Wow, I\u2019m proud of you, OP.  You messed up, owned it, dealt with the fallout, and are making adjustments for the future.  That takes a great deal of maturity.  I\u2019m sorry the relationship didn\u2019t work out but I think your partner is still out there.  Good luck!", "Wishing you and your son all the best.

I read and commented on your original post. Reading this update is spectacular! You're on the right path, keep at it! <3", "Mad respect for you OP on the personal growth", "Any update on your son? Because frankly the damage done to the relationship by introducing them as grandparents is so secondary to the damage done to your son being told he people are his grandparents when they\u2019re not.

Maybe you just didn\u2019t include it because it\u2019s too personal, which would understandable, but I hope there\u2019s been some restorative work there.", "Good on him for choosing what is best for himself and ending things. Good on you for using this as a chance for doing some self reflection and gaining some self awareness.

I think one thing OP needs to realize and has hopefully learned from this is that having a kid just slows the relationship down. At least, it should. The guy isn\u2019t just getting to know you. He\u2019s getting to know you AND your child. Part of deciding if he wants a serious relationship with you is also deciding if he wants kids\u2014and wants one immediately. And you both have to try to navigate this without getting your child\u2019s hopes up too high too soon. And all of that has to be settled before you start introducing his family as a permanent part of your child\u2019s life. \n\nIt just takes time. And that\u2019s okay! OP, you will find someone to love and cherish you and your son, but you need to realize that a whirlwind romance would not be in your son\u2019s best interest. Take your time with future guys. Make sure you know who they are and how they will treat you and your baby before you start calling them family. It will be slow, but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be good. The best loves are built brick by brick into a solid foundation that will last a lifetime.", "It's actually simple and there's nothing complicated about this mess. His parents never met the child, she barely knows his parents and she didn't tell the bf how she planned on introducing her child to his parents. That would weird anyone out, also parents stay in relationships without getting married everyday. She should have talked to Jay first. She was wrong.", "Agreed. She was the AH for that specific situation, but 1.5 years is way too long to be with a single mom who had a 2.5 year old when you met (and is now 4) and not know if you want to be his step-father.", "Lmao", "You missed the entire point. OP barely knew his parents and her child never met them. In what world would it be ok to refer to them as Grandparents especially since they never talked about marriage or telling her ex bf beforehand?

Sure, it\u2019s a big leap, but if every time someone tried to explore attitudes in a relationship always got this explosive of feedback regardless of past history, then we\u2019d all have a rough time.", "Shit, I cringe over stuff I said last week.", "I'm cringing about stuff I'm probably about to post right now.", "Me too though it is getting better and not worse, thankfully. \n\nI entered into what can only be called pathological cringing about 6 years ago when I realized (mid fight with SO) that I was a total asshole and had been my whole life. Years and years of conversations, arguments and issues came rushing back and I looked like I had Tourettes on some days. \n\nTo be in mid life and learn you have been *that person* more than not is painful AF. \n\nI wish I had had OPs openness.", "I still think OP should get more than 95% of the blame and should do most of the reflecting going forward, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ridiculous to say that introducing a significant other and her child to parents is a sign that you view the relationship as serious", "This would have been avoided if \"old-fashioned\" manners had been followed. But the \"Me! Me! Me!\" generation thinks those are stupid. Welp. Now she learned why those manner were a thing. Manners have always been about making the other person feel comfortable by not acting like a self-centered and oblivious AH.", "That\u2019s pretty much what the advice I gave originally was saying anyway. Being upfront that, yes, she has a child, and with any hope, this other person will be fine with being the stepdad. \n\nOf course, a child is extensive baggage, but it\u2019s a lot better to approach it rather than just drifting into relationships despite being with the goals you want out of it, but being point\u00e9d with what you are looking for in time. Just like practically any other relationship baggage/topic/preference.", "I think the issue is the ages of the four years in terms of the stage of life - especially since the older person had a child which meant they were probably developmentally in a different stage than someone who had just graduated from college and had minimal experience with the \"real world\" - first apartment; first real job; first significant relationship - all important milestones of someone in their early 20's.\n\nIf the boyfriend was 29 and OP was 34 then they would probably be closer aligned in terms of their life experience and milestones.\n\nI guess we will agree to disagree since I don't think a lot of guys in their early 20's would be thinking about the psychological aspects of playing with their girlfriend's toddler especially since no one except OP thought of the relationship as being that serious including OP's sister.", "\"He knew that he was dating a mother, he knew he was getting involved in a child's life.\"\n\nYes he knew that, but there is a wide ocean between being involved with a single parent and taking on a role of the other parent, and being involved with a single parent but just being their S/O and not taking on a parental role. \n\nTheir is no universal way to be involved with a single parent. \nSome single parents might not want their S/O to take on a significant role in the child's life. \n\nThat is the key. \n\nI think the main issue is OP making the decision for them without talking to them. \n\nIf my partner and I go out to eat and my partner orders food for me without asking I would be upset, EVEN if they ordered exactly what I wanted/planning to order. The problem would be taking the decision away from me not necessarily the actual decision they made.", "But viewing the relationship as serious is not the same as viewing your parents and grandparents to that child. \n\nThat is the issue not about how serious the relationship was or was not.", "You still don't refer to them as \"Grandma and Grandpa\" until invited.

She learned and won't make this mistake again.", "Not always, some families are close and just want to know who their kids are spending time with.\n\nBut yes, some people put more weight on it. \n\nDepends on how he's set the tone, to be honest. Clearly, it didn't match how OP thought as he seemed to be on the same page as his parents.", "That's the other thing.\n\nIf the thing they're hiding isn't enough to be a deal breaker, the fact they hid it can typically well be.", "Lmao, nice topic for therapy.\n\n\u201cSo my mom called me a dog in order to get a man\u2026.\u201d \ud83e\udd72", ">That\u2019s pretty much what the advice I gave originally was saying anyway.

Instead of expecting the person to be fine with it, realistically it would be a case of people that are open to the idea, or at least are willing to reflect on what OP's expectations are.\n\nThe advice made it seem like OP shouldn't settle for anything less than someone being fine with being a stepdad when told.", "Yeah sure, it can take time to absorb that expectation and really get to what it means. That seems to be what she has learned from this experience with Jay.\n\nBut at the end of the day, she really shouldn\u2019t settle for less in a long-term committed partner, and if someone is with her, full-well knowing about the child and still wanting to be with her, and then actively antagonises/neglects/bullies her child for being present, then that\u2019s failing the child and that is, to me, what my biggest worry would be if I was in her shoes. Of course it will take time to come around to it. But if they just can\u2019t, that\u2019s incompatibility right there.", "Well done OP, good for you. \n\nIf I can offer some advice, have you had a look at the freedom project? It will help you in the long run, in terms of relationships.", "Thanks for the update. I think it is so important for single moms not to introduce every person they date to their kids. If you\u2019ve been together for a few years, okay. But asking every person to take on some kind of parenting role is a lot for the person you\u2019re dating and even worse, could traumatize your child if they\u2019ve gotten attached and then you and the person break up. I had a fiend who did this like three times. Her kids were crying to me after one breakup and said they were tired of getting to know \u201cnew dads\u201d. It was heartbreaking and I ended our friendship over it.", "Congratulations, what's happening to you is emotional growth and maturity. Hopefully you have many more moments, though not as rough as this one, in your future. It's a great feeling to become more self aware and, for lack of a better term... actualized. Therapy might be a nice next step in the coming year. And maybe just be single and date yourself for a while. Don't worry about a \"partner,\" just focus on you and your kid.", "Well done OP! I wish you luck for the future Hun!", "I'm incredibly proud of you for how you handled your mistakes, and I believe your son has a good mother. Keep looking forward and working on communication.\nMy best tip for it is learn to communicate with yourself first ! Be able to have a conversation in your head about what you want and how to ask for it. You're doing great :)", "I applaud you for your candor. I'm sorry it didn't work out, but I'm glad you can move forward having learned", "This is so nice. Overstepping boundaries happens, and if there's anybody out there who's never been The Asshole I haven't met them and I'm pretty sure I don't want to, because they're probably insufferable. You handled all that feedback like a champ, and now you're setting yourself up for a better experience next time, just like growth is supposed to work. It's impressive, and I hope there's some comfort in that.", "Gold Medal for being a cool person who can hear criticism, reflect and grow.  Wow.  I am really impressed.", "I think it's too bad Jay wasn't ready for a more serious relationship because you seem like a pretty good partner in how you're empathetic and introspective.\n\nI think if I were a single parent, I would consider not introducing someone I'm dating to my child until it was clearly serious and then I wouldn't live with that person unless my child seemed ok with it.\n\nSome people claim single parents shouldn't date at all until the child is grown, but I think you can put your child's welfare first while still having a relationship.", "OP it will happen someday. Honestly, this breaks my heart for you.  You didn't mean to be disrespectful to anyone, and it sounds like you were in love with an AH. \n\nI have to say I think you dodged a bullet.  His families reaction after your mistake is so extreme.  You have dated for two years!!!!!! That's a long time to be in a relationship with a single mother.  I call my friend's kids my nieces and nephews. I also call my friends my sisters..etc. etc. Their reaction is so extreme it shows me they did not want their son (grandson) dating someone with a kid.  F*ck them! This isn't the 1950s and he was wasting your time. Love will come but until then give your baby a hug from me.", "I think single parents get so used to making executive decisions for their household without needing to consult another adult that it's common for them get into the habit of keeping that energy in every other aspect of their lives. Even with the last conversation you had with Jay, he had asked for space, you decided a conversation should happen sooner rather than later, so you made the executive decision to override Jays boundary and arrange a time to chat. \n\nDon't be too hard on yourself. We all have these moments where we have a rude awakening & realise we have to change or qualities to work on. Taking the first step is the most important thing.", "Good job", "Sounds like you learned a lot from this, so good on you for listening and understanding the issues. Hope you find a partner in the future that is a good fit for you and your family.", "I think maybe some things were not meant to be and I'm glad you can see this rationally.\n\nYou already saw him as a father figure for your son when he was not even prepared to be a father.

You should  be proud of yourself because you accepted the criticism, apologized, and are going to be working on your communication skills and setting expectations.

I wish you and your son the very best.", "I know thins is an update and you didn\u2019t ask but this has shifted my vote to ESH for the previous situation. \n\nHe knew your son was a package deal and \u201chadn\u2019t decided\u201d as to whether he would take on a fatherly role?! \n\nYou overstepped. You reflected and apologized. Awesome. \n\nHe showed you that he was even less committed than he\u2019d let on and that is on him", "It\u2019s certainly a social faux pas but it\u2019s not at all a crazy thought to jump to. It\u2019s crazier that in all this time he hasn\u2019t thought about whether or not he wants to \u201cstep into the dad role\u201d - you\u2019re dating someone who has a kid, what the fuck did you expect would happen? Like\u2026 was he benefitting off you in some way or is he just clueless? \n\nGood luck getting back out there. Be choosy as hell.", "Wow, bro was with you for 2 years and got to know your son, introduced you to his parents and didn't know if he was serious? I'd say you're better off without that loser. Let him screw around a few more years and then miss the boat on an actual relationship. Feel bad for you and your son tho.", "Obviously OP learned her lesson but I do feel like her ex was kind of ridiculous.

Based on comments OP shared from her sister in the original post, even the sister didn\u2019t think it was serious. \n\nWhen I was a single mom, I casually dated one guy for 2.5 years. The difference was I knew I wasn\u2019t serious with him and did not introduce him to my kids.

Bringing a significant other who already has a child/children to \"meet the parents\" without intent to eventually take on a serious role in the child's life is very fucked up. He strung you along, and fucked with your heart.\n\nJay said that he hadn\u00b4t decided to take on that role, not that he wasn\u00b4t going to eventually. Perhaps Jay introduced the kid to his parents planning on taking that role in the forseeable future and ease up his own family to it, but OP\u00b4s haste messed the whole plan up.", "There's a HUGE gap between ignoring a child and taking on a dad role. My step mom was more like an aunt than a mom. She had and exercised limited authority over us but still showed us love and took care of us. My dad was the same way with her daughter. Everyone was happy with the dynamic.", "When I first read OP's original post, I did wonder if this was a well defined \"relationship\". Even though OP said they had been together for 1.5 years, every single person in OP's post, other than OP, seemed to think that their relationship wasn't that serious - BF, OP's sister, and the BF's parents, included.", "Yeah, this is the bit that pushed the original post to ESH.  OP made some assumptions and mistakes, but seriously, who gets into a long term relationship with a single mother and doesn't stop to think what that means in terms of their relationship with the kid(s)?  *Two years* down the track and he's only **now** realised he doesn't want to be part of the kid's family, and only because of an offhand comment from OP?\n\nThe good thing that comes out of this is that OP isn't sinking any more time into a relationship with someone so self-absorbed he never even thought about if he wanted the sort of relationship she thought he was looking for.

OP was in the wrong in that particular instance but I really feel sorry for her.", "Agree with you!  I like OP!
