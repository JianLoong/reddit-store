My brother is 32 but has only just dealt with the shit he went through as a kid from people who a) thought he was a lot older than he was and had expectations of him that he didn't/couldn't meet, and b) thought he was intimidating/aggressive when he was, in fact, the *total* opposite.\n\nSo yeah, your ex is already a *massive* AH for giving your son a complex about his size, but is doubly so that he's now wanting to punish him for something that reads to me like he hasn't actually done?\n\n~~NTA~~ \\[Edit\\] Changed to YTA after you provided more info on what it was Nico actually did.

A potentially innocent party and soneone with no bearing or control over Jess's behaviour. That's not protecting Bailey. That's perpetuating the problem. And you encouraging it/approving it is wrong.

He is innocent. This is bad advice. Nico is just a bully.", "There was some teasing", "On the matter of the instilling that he can be intimidating due to height, and size, I think it may have been phrased poorly in the post. Being taller and bigger than most other people is something you have to be aware of  as how people perceive your actions are effected by that, regardless of your intentions. Thus being aware of how you can be naturally intimidating is important so that you can take steps to ensure you don't cause distress to anyone else (speaking from experience, being 6ft 2 and bigger).\nAnd on the bullying, Nicos heart was in the right place, but he went through the wrong person. The person he targeted wasn't involved, he was the brother of the bully. He is not responsible for policing his sisters actions, his parents are and so he should be left out of it.", "OP wrote that her son and friends at least teased that kid.", "Because Nico is bullying the wrong person.
