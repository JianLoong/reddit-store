Besides, Nico didn't actually bully him, instead he gave him a warning. \n\nThe school has some audacity to get involved when no help with given to Bailey when she needed help. I would put in more complaints about this.", "NTA. It would be weirder if he didn\u2019t say anything. The school didn\u2019t protect your daughter so her brother stepped in.\n \nWhen I was in elementary school I was bullied and hit constantly by a guy in my class and when I reported it, my parents were told that his parents were going through a bad divorce and nothing really happened. Then my big sister came back from boarding school, waited at the gates for us and beat the crap out of him, he never spoke to me again. It really takes a village.", "All Nico did was tell Jess's brother to make the bullying stop?  Why are Jess's parents telling you to \"stop\".  It would seem something more than a conversation of \"stop bullying or else\" occurred.", "NTA Firstly \"my ex has always instilled in him that due to his height and size he can be intimidating\" who da fuck says this to a kid???? I mean I kind of, sort of, don't really get it to an extent but like you make kids feel body positive not  the other way around. Wrong lesson your ex is teaching him right there.\n\n Secondly \" + Nicos size that it\u2019s just unacceptable\" dudes on the wrong fucking wrong track here\n\nThirdly sounds like he stood up to someone as opposed to really bullying them? \n\nAlso not 100% clear on this all of this as you've not written completely clearly. So apologies if I've misunderstood.", "I understand now why he became your EX.\n\nNTA", "Nta but \"you did a good thing protecting your sister, now you must make sure you don't take it too far and become the problem. Tell the boys you're sorry and as long as they leave your sister alone there are no hard feelings.\"", "NTA.\n\nThere may be other issues at play here, as in why did it have to come to this instead of you pushing the school, Jess and/or her parents to stop your daughter's bullying. But for not punishing your son for what amounts to protecting his little sister? No, of course you're not in the wrong.", "NTA.... Nico did NOT bully Jess' brother, he just offered to return the favor. To tell him that he's going to treat him the exact same way that Jess was treating Bailey.... People, people.... Dig out your dictionary please.\n\nHe didn't threaten Jess' brother, he warned him. There is a difference.\n\nHear me out here.... Why does the bully never get in trouble? Because noone sees what they are doing until the one being bullied reacts. Your son just reacted on behalf of his sister.", ">my ex has always instilled in him that due to his height and size he can be intimidating\u2026I know Nico has a lot of resentment/shame because of this.\n\nI'm just gonna say that, as someone whose brother was always bigger and taller than his peers, this kind of thing can be HUGELY mentally damaging to a child and can cause problems well into adulthood. My brother is 32 but has only just dealt with the shit he went through as a kid from people who a) thought he was a lot older than he was and had expectations of him that he didn't/couldn't meet, and b) thought he was intimidating/aggressive when he was, in fact, the *total* opposite. \n\nSo yeah, your ex is already a *massive* AH for giving your son a complex about his size, but is doubly so that he's now wanting to punish him for something that reads to me like he hasn't actually done?\n\nNTA", "NTA Nico is not supposed to look out for his little sister? Good for him.", "NTA, he was protective of his little sister, how could you punish him for that?", "NTA, big bro used bigness to protect little sister when adults wouldn't", "YTA.\n\nNico sounds like his heart is in the right place, but he is going about this horribly.  So this guy (Jess' brother) is totally innocent in all of this, but your son is threatening him for his sisters actions?  And you are ok with this.  It doesn't matter if nothing happened yet, but he is threatening an innocent kid for literally no reason.  You definitely need to step in here and punish him.", "NTA - Nico is a amazing big brother, the school dont care about her , glad she have a brother", "YTA. What exactly did Jess\u2019 brother do?", "Yta. Nico didn't confront the bully or protect Bailey in the moment. Nico bullied the bullies brother and threatened to continue. A potentially innocent party and soneone with no bearing or control over Jess's behaviour. That's not protecting Bailey. That's perpetuating the problem. And you encouraging it/approving it is wrong. Focus on getting Bailey the help she needs without turning nico into a selfrighteous bully. His intent doesn't matter when his delivery was completely wrong. Sounds like the only decent parent in this scenario is nicos dad and stepmom.", "YTA, your son and his friends bullied a kid that hast nothing to do with the situation, other than being jess' brother.\nFells a bit like family liability.", "NTA.  In another neighborhood it would be called street justice.  I personally think it's a good thing the big brother is looking out for his little sister.", "NTA. I have a brother, he was bullied. He was Baileys age when they jumped him: threw his shoes in the bin and punched his face. Did those bullies get punished for assaulting my baby brother? No, and I couldn't do anything about it. I see nothing wrong with what Nico did, bullies deserve to rot in hell.", "NTA Unfortunately he was placed in a situation that the school forced him to stand up for his sister. \nHe did the right thing in an awful situation without taking it too far. Bullies sometimes only respond to strength. You could have a look at assertiveness training and self defence for Bailey so she has the skills to stand up for herself when Nico\u2019s not around.", "ESH, bullying is never the answer, and a bully is normally always bullied at some point, so chances are someone else will just get bullied more somewhere down the line.", "ESH but Bailey. Your son shouldn\u2019t even be in the situation he was in. But then he could have decided to talk to the brother about the problem instead of threatening him.", "NTA. From your description it sounds like Nico *threatened* to bully the other guy but didn't actually go through with it. And the threat worked: Jess stopped bullying Bailey. Nico should get a pass on this occasion. Just as long as he never makes the threat again for any less noble reason than protecting his sister.", "Nta. He sounds like a great big brother.", "YTA\n\nSo your kid is bullied, to a point where your other kid feels the need to step in in a fairly childish way. Meanwhile, you do no parenting at all apparently, by not protecting one and no teaching the other", "NTA - Nico's a good bro, this is actually kinda sweet. I don't think it even counts as bullying tbh. As long as Nico doesn't continue to \"bully\" the guy after he's stopped picking on Bailey then I see no problem here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Blame th school op", "Nta that's not being a bully. That's protecting his sister.  My brother straight up decked a kid who has hassling me and my parents didn't punish him.", "NTA- he used his bulk in a good way. I wish all bullies could be stopped so easily. He didn\u2019t pound the dude, just told him to make his sister stop or he\u2019d do something about it.

Keep up the good work.", "NTA - the school wouldn't solve the problem, so Nico did. If the school and Jess's parents don't like what Nico did, they should have handled the issue sooner\n\nWhy would you punish your son for protecting his sister?", "NTA.  He is just sticking up for his family.  Since the school wont do anything, he stepped up.  as long as the other kid stops bullying, nico wont bully either, right?  Sounds fair to me", "YTA. So we're going after bloodlines like medieval Scotland now?", "YTA. 2 wrongs don\u2019t make a right. \n\nThe outcome may be favorable for Bailey, but doesn\u2019t make it overall applaudable", "NTA! You tried doing what is right and that didn\u2019t work. Your son makes it stop. Give him an extra good Xmas present", "NTA something needed to be done", "NTA if the school and Jess's mom had done their jobs it wouldn't have got to this. Tell Nico he is a good person and brother, ok knock off the teasing now, but your ex should be shamed for the way he treats Nico. Not acceptable to body shame a boy or girl.", "No! Why the hell is the school contacting you about Nico bullying a kid but did nothing when Bailey is the victim? NTA. Nico protected his little sister.", "Considering the ages, it\u2019s probably 2 different schools.", "Except Nico is bullying the wrong person, Jess was the one who was bullying his sister, and Nico was bullying Jess' BROTHER. He is innocent. This is bad advice. Nico is just a bully.", "There was some teasing", "On the matter of the instilling that he can be intimidating due to height, and size, I think it may have been phrased poorly in the post. Being taller and bigger than most other people is something you have to be aware of  as how people perceive your actions are effected by that, regardless of your intentions. Thus being aware of how you can be naturally intimidating is important so that you can take steps to ensure you don't cause distress to anyone else (speaking from experience, being 6ft 2 and bigger).\nAnd on the bullying, Nicos heart was in the right place, but he went through the wrong person. The person he targeted wasn't involved, he was the brother of the bully. He is not responsible for policing his sisters actions, his parents are and so he should be left out of it.", "OP wrote that her son and friends at least teased that kid.", "Because Nico is bullying the wrong person. Jess' brother is innocent and hasn't done anything wrong, it sounds like he has never even met Nico's sister.", "Its amazing I had to scroll so far to find this. \n\nThe brother is totally innocent.  I'm guessing the brother has as much control over Jess as Nico has over Bailey.  They probably aren't even in the same school", "As I said I\u2019ve tried taking to the school, to the parent and nothing has stopped", "But he didn\u2019t bully Bailey his sister did. And he was basically threatened to stop Jess or he has to suffer the consequences of Jess\u2018 actions and that is not fair. Who says Jess would even listen to her brother? He could have told Jess to stop or her brother to tell her to stop but without threatening (and going through) with bullying and innocent third party.", "So your larger physically intimidating popular son AND his friends basically ganged up to confront and \"tease\" on a smaller less popular boy who's only \"crime\" is being related to an actual bully. And you still don't see that as a problem. You're parenting skills are rife in hypocrisy and you suck\nEdited to add the school needs to address the entire group and punish them all including your ringleader BULLY son", "He needs to be disciplined for the teasing .... But not for warning Jess' brother about treating him the same way she treated Bailey. He should apologize for the teasing at the very least then.... If you don't discipline him for the teasing then YTA. Warning someone is one thing, teasing is a whole different ball game.", "Interesting choice of word...teasing.  so....bullying....  nico and his friends bullied him.  A group with more power making mean spirited remarks.", "Right? I'm all about protecting family...but going after and potentially traumatizing another kid to do it is just wrong. nicos mommy is a shitty parent who's teaching nico it's okay to be a bully as long as he can manufacture an excuse because the end justifies the means.", "The best response to everyone\n\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t bullying, he is defending. Something he wouldn\u2019t have had to do if all the involved grownups had done their roles.\u201d\n\nNTA", "You may want to clarify that in your post.  All you say is \"the school hasn't done anything\".  That isn't terribly clear in the post that you spoke to the school or just expected them to step in.  You don't mention talking to the other parent at all", "But he was not defending...he just retaliated by ganging up with his friends on a smaller less popular boy who wasn't the actual bully. So by your logic if I don't like something you do I should round up my posse and target one of your family members? Nico bullied an innocent boy."]}
