Nico is just a bully.", "There was some teasing", "On the matter of the instilling that he can be intimidating due to height, and size, I think it may have been phrased poorly in the post. Being taller and bigger than most other people is something you have to be aware of  as how people perceive your actions are effected by that, regardless of your intentions. Thus being aware of how you can be naturally intimidating is important so that you can take steps to ensure you don't cause distress to anyone else (speaking from experience, being 6ft 2 and bigger).\nAnd on the bullying, Nicos heart was in the right place, but he went through the wrong person.

Nico\u2019s social status tells me he could\u2019ve simply told that kid what was happening and that would\u2019ve been enough. It\u2019s not uncommon for bullies to come from dysfunctional families. If Jess hated her brother she could\u2019ve easily used the situation to get Nico to do her dirty work by doubling down on bullying your daughter. There\u2019s a real chance that Jess\u2019 family pressured her to fallback on her bullying to highlight your son\u2019s bad behavior and to put Nico in the worst light possible. You are not exercising good judgement especially at a time when your son is applying to college and exists at a time with tons of anti-bullying laws & zero-tolerance policies. You\u2019re teaching your son to play checkers instead of chess he\u2019s practically an adult. If your son was being mean to that child online there are TONS of cyberbullying laws that could come down on him.\n\nEdit: If your son is applying to college you better pray this doesn\u2019t bite your son in the ass.

Kid never bullied her friend again. Sometimes you need to stand up for someone or for yourself in a way that's appropriate. Obviously I don't condone things like bringing a weapon to school or bullying someone online or extensively in any way but firing back with words or hitting back when you're being hit is a normal response proportionate to the situation as a kid. And giving a warning to back off when it comes to a younger sibling or friend is natural.\n\nEdit: after rereading it sounds like Nico might be bothering the Bully's older siblings. I think it kind of depends on a lot more details and just how he spoke to this person.

If the girl bullying Jess was doing it because of a shitty home life, then her brother likely suffers the same but doesn't bully people to try and cope.
