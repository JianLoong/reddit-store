While I grew up an only child, my wife has one sister, Jamie (23f), who is a graduate student at a university. \n\nJamie needed a place to stay after she and her long-term boyfriend (6-ish years) broke up. My wife and I offered to let her stay in our guest house temporarily while she gets back on her feet. A week had gone by when she started to act way out of character. \n\nShe would go out overnight without telling my wife or I where she was or who she was with. Which, I am aware that she is an adult but it is super concerning when I leave for work in the morning and I have no idea where she is. I really was just worried for her safety. I mentioned this to my wife and she said that she would talk with her.\n\nOver the span of the next two weeks she had at least five different guys over, and I had a confrontation with one guy after I caught him leaving, and when I asked him who he was he ignored me and ran to his car. \n\nWhen I asked Jamie about this, she laughed it off that he was \"just a friend\"  but insisted that he was harmless. I told her I don't like her bringing random guys to my home all the time. Then she said that he wasn't a random guy but that she would just start spending the night at their places again, instead. \n\nI told Jamie that she needs to calm down with the guys, and said that she isn't going to fix her problems banging a bunch of other dudes (as a joke). She got super mad at me and said that it wasn't any of my business. I said that if she wants to continue staying with us for free that she should be more considerate and that I am just trying to look out for her.\n\nJamie went to my wife and told her about how I \"chased the guy down\" and that she feels like I'm just making up rules to \"shame\" her. Now, we are not allowed to talk to each other and all communication is going through my wife, who thinks that I was super out of line for what I said.\n\nThe way I see it is that Jamie is a guest, living in our guest house for free and all that I really care about is that she isn't out getting herself killed and that she isn't bringing sketchy guys over. I feel like I am not asking a lot and I feel like this is being blown out of proportion, even if the joke was insensitive.  \n\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1677036033, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118njh2/aita_for_confronting_my_sisterinlaw_about_all_of/", "score": 1981, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Guess what: women have been trained from birth to do everything they can to avoid bad men, and they learn early on that enjoying life (including sex) means risk. Like driving a car, there are inherent risks to enjoying life when there are bad men out there. You are trying to forbid her from driving because you worry about her crashing. Women are way more experienced than you at putting on their metaphorical safety belts and looking both ways. Women need to live their lives.\n\nSo here is what you are going to do, OP! You are going to apologize.

And you handled it badly. \n\nYou are then going to apologize for not having talks about overnight guests before she moved in. You are going to reiterate that you care about your SiL and the tough time she is going through, and you are going to ask what she thinks is reasonable in terms for the number of overnight guests per week as a compromise. You are going to say that you will stay out of her business if she is gone for the night, and while it is never ever required she can check in with your wife if she wants to, but only if it makes her feel more safe (not for you to feel more safe). Ask her if she feels safe on the property, and offer to look into buying cameras for doorways around your home but only if she feels comfortable.

Dude...you really haven't learned not to come between your Wife and her little Sister yet?    Then you basically insult her to her face?  I hope your couch is comfy. I agree that she shouldn't be running a brothel out of your guest house, but that's something you discuss with your Wife and let her handle it.\n\nHow would you expect her to act at 23 after a six-year relationship?  She is experiencing single life at an age where she can go clubbing for the first time in her life. You're lucky your Wife isn't going with her!", "So you were pissed off that she was spending the night at their houses and then she started bringing them over instead and that pissed you off?

Let me make sure I understand this...\n You get mad because your adult SIL was out of the guest house she's staying in overnight. Doing whatever she wanted to do. \n\n You then get mad when - as a solution to your weird creepy obsession with where she is at night - she decides to have people come to her.  So she doesn't go out. Per your request. \n\n You then get mad at people coming over because for some reason, you think it's your business who your SIL sleeps with.

And while you're at it, apologize to your SIL.", "YTA.  You're absolutely in your rights to say you aren't comfortable with a bunch of strangers coming over, but the fact you've gone so far as being concerned about her promiscuity is where the problem lies.  Hopefully she can get on her feet quickly and move into her own place where you won't be in her business.", "Going against the masses here, but NTA. She's a guest. You have a right to feel secure in your home. You have a right to worry about a guest/family bringing folks that can't even talk and then run off. \n\nYou tried to communicate and she went off the rails versus having an actual conversation like the \"adult\" she's supposed to me. She can feel offended, repressed or whatever. Doesn't mean she gets to act like an ass.\n\nI had a roommate do that shit. She was living as a guest long term. Barely asked for anything from her. But when she started sleeping with different men in the room next to my baby, I said nope. Was not comfortable with a parade of people I don't know to trust wander through MY place. \n\nSo, she can't follow a security request that makes things feel unsafe? Ask her to leave. She is family, sure\nShe's also a guest paying nothing and risking a lot of things not hers. Talk with wife first naturally, don't be a tyrannt, but its your house too. You should get to feel safe and feel things are safe. If wife supports the sister over you, go be someplace safe.

You need to step back and leave her alone.", "YTA, slut shame much. You don\u2019t need to have any input how sil heals from he past relationship. She was 17 the last time she was single and obviously missed out on fun. Maybe ex was not satisfactory and she needs to blow off steam. Have some real sexual experience.

God forbid someone gets hurt; he may end up being legally responsible for any injury. Depending on what his county or state laws are regarding property insurance, she could be putting him at risk by even being there herself much less inviting strangers over. Not to mention that he doesn't know these these men. How can SIL guarantee these men are not a threat to him and his wife? She can't. \n\nOutside of that, I'd say OP is the AH in how he is handling it and his comment to her about it.
