While I grew up an only child, my wife has one sister, Jamie (23f), who is a graduate student at a university. \n\nJamie needed a place to stay after she and her long-term boyfriend (6-ish years) broke up. My wife and I offered to let her stay in our guest house temporarily while she gets back on her feet. A week had gone by when she started to act way out of character. \n\nShe would go out overnight without telling my wife or I where she was or who she was with. Which, I am aware that she is an adult but it is super concerning when I leave for work in the morning and I have no idea where she is. I really was just worried for her safety. I mentioned this to my wife and she said that she would talk with her.\n\nOver the span of the next two weeks she had at least five different guys over, and I had a confrontation with one guy after I caught him leaving, and when I asked him who he was he ignored me and ran to his car. \n\nWhen I asked Jamie about this, she laughed it off that he was \"just a friend\"  but insisted that he was harmless. I told her I don't like her bringing random guys to my home all the time. Then she said that he wasn't a random guy but that she would just start spending the night at their places again, instead. \n\nI told Jamie that she needs to calm down with the guys, and said that she isn't going to fix her problems banging a bunch of other dudes (as a joke). She got super mad at me and said that it wasn't any of my business. I said that if she wants to continue staying with us for free that she should be more considerate and that I am just trying to look out for her.\n\nJamie went to my wife and told her about how I \"chased the guy down\" and that she feels like I'm just making up rules to \"shame\" her. Now, we are not allowed to talk to each other and all communication is going through my wife, who thinks that I was super out of line for what I said.\n\nThe way I see it is that Jamie is a guest, living in our guest house for free and all that I really care about is that she isn't out getting herself killed and that she isn't bringing sketchy guys over. I feel like I am not asking a lot and I feel like this is being blown out of proportion, even if the joke was insensitive.  \n\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1677036033, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118njh2/aita_for_confronting_my_sisterinlaw_about_all_of/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like driving a car, there are inherent risks to enjoying life when there are bad men out there. You are trying to forbid her from driving because you worry about her crashing. Women are way more experienced than you at putting on their metaphorical safety belts and looking both ways. Women need to live their lives.\n\nSo here is what you are going to do, OP! You are going to apologize. Your apology is going to include the fact that you didn\u2019t realize you had so many issues to work through about recognizing your SiL as an adult with an adult lifestyle, and about some of your prudishness around what is happening. And you handled it badly. \n\nYou are then going to apologize for not having talks about overnight guests before she moved in. You are going to reiterate that you care about your SiL and the tough time she is going through, and you are going to ask what she thinks is reasonable in terms for the number of overnight guests per week as a compromise. You are going to say that you will stay out of her business if she is gone for the night, and while it is never ever required she can check in with your wife if she wants to, but only if it makes her feel more safe (not for you to feel more safe). Ask her if she feels safe on the property, and offer to look into buying cameras for doorways around your home but only if she feels comfortable.

Or is it because you\u2019re trying to control her? Would you be upset if Jamie was a guy bringing girls home, or if Jamie brought other girls home?", "YTA\n\nShe\u2019s single; she can stay out and sleep with who she wants. You\u2019re making up excuses to keep tabs on her and it\u2019s weird tbh. \nI can appreciate not wanting random men at your home, as long as it\u2019s because you\u2019re not comfortable with strangers and not just you being a judgemental dick about her sex life.", "YTA Being a bit creepy/obsessive about you\u2019re SIL. She isn\u2019t into you.", "Jokes are funny.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t funny. That was your honest intention blurted out in a moment of anger, let\u2019s be honest with ourselves.\n\nStill, I\u2019d be a bit upset with random dudes walking about my house without my knowledge.\n\nESH overall, but a little extra YTA for the lame attempt at covering your words\u2026. Joke. Sure it was.", "YTA - if you don\u2019t want her bringing guys over, that is understandable but dude she is an adult! If she wants to stay out all night she doesn\u2019t owe you any explanation or information. It\u2019s none of your business! Monitoring her comings and goings is a bit creepy.", "YTA.  If you and your wife are making new rules regarding houseguests for her sister, be clear with her about them. No need to slut shame her though. That's just creepy from a BIL.", "YTA - she\u2019s an adult, you shouldnt have offered to let her stay in your guest house if you were going to try and police her behavior.", "ESH. \n\nJamie shouldn\u2019t be having random guys in your home.   \nYou shouldn\u2019t be policing Jamie\u2019s sex life. She\u2019s an adult.  \nRe whether she should tell you if she\u2019s home at night\u2026 only if you are also preparing meals for her, or established beforehand that she would.", "ESH\n\nYou don\u2019t get to dictate her life and what she decides to do with it just because she\u2019s living under your roof. TBH you sound kinda creepy but I\u2019ll save that for another day.\n\nShe should also be considerate about bringing random dudes to your home, there are too many weirdos out here.", "MYOB  She can do the whole team in the end zone and you don\u2019t get to say fk all.\nYTA", "YTA. You get upset because she stays the night, so she brings people over. You get upset because people are brought over, (understandle tbf since you don't know them,) but then she says okay and that she will just go back to going to their houses, you slut shame her? Is she just not allowed to do anything in the hopes that you don't get upset? She is 23, not 15. Again, I totally get not wanting them in your house, but you are also upset she goes and stays the night.\n\nETA: I just saw that she isn't in the main house, but instead the guest house. I can still maybe understand not wanting random people over. However, that makes the whole being upset over her being out late, even stranger. Why should that matter? While I'm not going to assume you have a thing for her or anything, you do seem strangely obsessed with her sex life. Maybe you should take a step back and ask yourself why?", "YTA. She\u2019s a grown woman. You\u2019re mad if she has guys stay the night then you\u2019re mad if she stays the night at their house. Seems like that would solve your problem of strangers being in your house but you\u2019re still mad. Why are you policing her vagina? It\u2019s weird and creepy.", " Both of you are TA.  SIL should not bring random people to your home/guesthouse and you shouldn\u2019t shame her for who she sleeps with.  Maybe you all need to sit down like adults and come up with some ground rules.", "Here are my thoughts. If she is inviting people over who she knows personally, then I would argue that you should leave her alone. What is she supposed to do? Ask you every time she wants to bring a friend over, something could happen at a moments notice. If she is inviting strangers over, that is a different story. \n\nAlso, if she is out of the house (even if it is for long periods of time) that is no big deal. She is not in your house, so it is none of your concern.", "ESH. She is inviting people in your home without permission and you for trying to control her life choices", "NTA.  Most likely she met these guys online and is bringing them onto your property.\n\nI would not be happy with that either.  But she came up with a solution- she will just stay over at all these guys places.  Problem solved.", "Yes, YTA, just because op believes that if his sil moves in, that means she's his daughter now", "Right o.", "Yes to all of this. Hell. I think if you sat all involved parties here (minus extraneous men) over some mimosas, iced tea, & pancakes - you\u2019d have this all worked out for OP before sundown.", "You are correct. She should move out.", "But why? SIL already said ok to not bringing them over anymore. She's fine going to their place. How is that not ok?", "She intimately knows five different guys to bring overnight in one week? It sounds like these are one night stands. You just don\u2019t get that luxury if you are living off of someone else. Obviously he is wrong for not wanting her to go out and restrict her, but it\u2019s still his property.", "She can do whatever in her own place. Not in someone's guest house.", "it's a separate house it's not like she's bringing them into his house", "And they aren't even in OP's home. A guest house is a separate residence. It's super weird that he's keeping such close watch on what she does, when she's home, how many people and who they are...like how does he know it was five *different* guys unless he's been creeping?", ">Why do you know just how many guys are coming in and out?\n\nit's hard not to notice different cars around the guest house before I leave for work, that's all.", "Its a guest house - why should she need permission?", "I think you have to keep in mind OP is an only child. Not saying he's socially inept, but he probably doesn't know how to talk to Jamie specifically without either being an overbearing big brother, or treating her like the guys (hence the gross joke).", "Yeah, but it\u2019s just as much his wife\u2019s house, too.", "Everyone loves to act like \u201crandom men\u201d are so scary but it\u2019s the ones who know you who are most likely to kill you.", "She's still a guest. NOT an owner, guests should know not to overstep.", "But she tried not having anyone over, and he complained about that, so she's doing what he asked in the first place.", "Guest house*", "Its not even actually his home. She's in the guest house.", "OPs house:\n\n\u201cWife can you tell your sister that Reddit said we both suck here.\u201d", "But she was staying out at their houses originally and OP got on her for that too. He's creepy and controlling. She's young and newly single. He needs to stay in his lane.", "I mean, he does get a say in who stays overnight at his house though right? But her sex life, no. I wouldn\u2019t want random dudes staying overnight at my place either.", "His property is his business. He is in the right.", "She was doing that. He got annoyed that she was staying out and forbid it. That's when she started bringing them back to the guesthouse out back.", "Wouldn't that make him the AH then? Cuz the issue is that he commented on her sex life. She agreed to go over to their place instead.", "She tried that.  He slut shamed her and made his wife pressure her to stay home.", "Different cars in the driveway would be a good indicator, and he mentions he tried to get the name of one of them before they got in their car and drove off.\n\nNot saying you're wrong, just saying it wouldn't be hard to notice random cars in your own driveway, or notice when your SIL car hasn't been there since the day before.", "Is your property. She needs to be respectful if she\u2019s not she hast to go. NTA. You need to tell your wife either her sister starts showing respect because she\u2019s living in your guest house for free or she needs to go. Now if you did have siblings, I\u2019m pretty sure the same rules would apply to them.", "I apologize, I didn\u2019t see the part about it being a guest house. I read it as \u201cin our house.\u201d Editing my comment!", "Because she's a GUEST. In someone's GUEST house. Decorum, manners, education... some nerve....", "I'm an only child too. I get not really understanding how siblings deal with boundaries & personal conversations.\n\nBut that's exactly why I wouldn't say anything directly no matter how worried I am genuinely. I'd bring it up to my partner.", "Uhm, ok? Good to know. Thanks. I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s relevant to my comment\u2026 but go off, I guess.", "She tried going elsewhere. She was shamed for that.", "How is she overstepping? He didn't want her staying out all night, so she adapted and brought the guys home instead. Then the first time he brings this up with her, he  sl**t shames her and is confused as two why what he said/his weird possessiveness of his ADULT sister-in-law is inappropriate. \n\nHe manufactured this situation through his own meddling", "GUEST* house", "Guest house or not it\u2019s still his home", "Just because it\u2019s separate from the main house doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not their home. It\u2019s their property, their belongings, and they are responsible for it.", "I didn\u2019t see the bit about that first part but I agree 100%", "This - she was originally going out to meet up with her male friends until OP started monitoring her movements and encouraged her to stay home.\n\nSeems like he might just be trying to be helpful/protective, but based on the context we have it seeks like he is being controlling to an inappropriate degree given their relationship.", "So she\u2019s not allowed to have sex? Because she wasn\u2019t bringing them to his house and that was a problem but now she is and she\u2019s \u201cdisrespecting his house\u201d. Get a grip.", "[deleted]", "After a week or more of staying she could be considered a tenant with rights but regardless of that OP is being really weird and controlling about the people she has over. Banning her friends and whoever from going when it\u2019s a separate guest house just shows that he has no respect for her as an adult in the first place.", "Absolutely. He handled this the wrong way and needs to apologize to them both. Can't imagine how annoyed his wife must be by this whole situation.", "I\u2019m agreeing with you? But go off I guess lmao", "Guest house that is likely fully furnished and may have sentimental things in it\u2026 The issue I have isn\u2019t Op worried about strangers on his property - is is with the decision to slut shame someone and feel like they have a right to control when she comes home etc", "They\u2019re random to him, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re random to her", "So if she were hosting a book club would OP still get to dictate who comes and goes?", "If that\u2019s the case I\u2019ve very clearly read your comment in the wrong context and apologise. :)", "Right - this isnt about the guests, its about controlling what she does.", "You\u2019re right about that", "His home", "Right. Which is why I also ruled Op is TA. My overall impression is that his real concern is policing her sex life (however \u201cwell intended\u201d he thinks he\u2019s being) and not actually worried about the property.\n\nTBH if his main motivation is her safety then he would WANT her at the guest house. Because if it\u2019s concern for her well being and she is choosing to numb the pain with sex hookups then it would be better for it to happen where she can scream or run for help if one of them is creepy or sketchy!", "That he is letting her use. But answer the question - what does OP get to dictate?", "Yeah, he gets to dictate whether she brings guests to his property, whether for reaming or reading. This isn't hard."]}
