Hide it in an empty tub of butter or something so you can keep it in the fridge without her noticing?

But why do u keep the chocolate in the fridge? Just keep it in your room. Doesn\u2019t need to be stored in the fridge\u2026.", "NTA.\n\n Talking as someone from your sister's perspective. \n\n I was trying to slim down for the military. I was eating chicken or fish and lettuce and that's it. Sometimes Celery if the craving for snacking got too high. \n\n And I was fucking miserable. \n\nBecause every time I open the fridge it would be full of things I couldn't have. Full of things that I used to love and enjoy.  Sometimes I'd have to leave the kitchen or I would find myself eating it.\n\n That's not my parents fault, that's not my brother's fault but at the time I had a little to no self control.  I know that I can't expect them to cater to me. So I didn't and I let them do what they wanted. And mentally I was going nuts. \n\n Every time I walked into the kitchen I felt like gorging myself on the food there. I had been fantasizing about bread or pudding cups or f*cking Apple sauce. It was so difficult, not to just grab one and eat it. Because it was right there. \n\n  Well my diet went over October 31st. And it was Halloween and my parents love giving out candy on Halloween so we had 4 bags of f*cking candy.  My dad kept saying Hey what's the harm just have one piece it'll be fine.\n\nI had to munch through an entire bag of celery, new bag mind you, just to get the want to crunch out of my system. And then it was just fantasies about the f*cking candy.  I was delusional.  \n\nI felt like crying all the fucking time because here I was surrounded by things that I can't eat but so badly wanted. \n\n==\n\n Well anyway I stuck with it and dropped a 100 pounds in 4 months. ( Life circumstances hit and I couldn't join the military). \n\n Long story short: I'm no longer on that diet but holy moley, it was very very taxing on my control.  And it was so very tempting to just take out my stress on my family.", "NAH. A wedding is an important milestone for many people and the pressure to look your best to feel your best is probably at the height for an occasion like this. With all of the decision making of a wedding, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s facing decision fatigue so when she opens the refrigerator and sees something she wants but knows she shouldn\u2019t have, it breaks down her willingness to resist it by just a little. And sometimes when you\u2019re trying to refrain from eating something, it\u2019s as if your brain thinks about it more.\n\nThis is NOT an excuse for her to be mean or dictate your choices. It was not nice for your sister to accuse you of sabotaging her on purpose. Many people here are saying she\u2019s an adult and it\u2019s her problem but from your post/comments it sounds like you come from a caring family and that you want to support your sister. You\u2019re not random strangers who happen to live together. Being a family means you look out for one another even if there are sometimes some minor inconveniences on your part.\n\nIf you\u2019re eating small portions and then you\u2019re good for a week or two it seems like you don\u2019t eat much chocolate all that frequently. Would it be difficult to purchase chocolate only when you\u2019re craving it and refrain from purchasing the bars that would have leftovers? Are there smaller ones you can buy single servings of like those Lindt Lindor chocolate balls? The brown paper bag idea also seems like an inexpensive resolution. If small inconveniences on your part would be a great help to her, it might be worth it to show your support in that way.", "YTA because you keep chocolate in the fridge", "NTA. I mean, yeah, you\u2019re a monster for how you eat chocolate, but NTA because your sister has no willpower.", "Nta, it's on her to learn self control, if she can't do that it's not on you", "NTA But it would be considerate to just keep the chocolate in your room. If you do not have own room, in own cupboard or something. Not necessary a duty to do so, just being considerate.\n\nShe is being a bit controlling here and she is possibly not thinking straight out of hunger. So, as I said, no duty.", "NTA.  She wants to pretend she has no responsibility for her own actions here.  You\u2019re not shoving the chocolate down her throat or anything, so she\u2019s just making excuses why it won\u2019t be her fault if. she ends up eating something she wants to avoid.", "NTA- The problem is not your chocolate. The problem is her lack of self-control and discipline. She's being selfish and you should ignore her. A few squares of chocolate wouldn't wreck her diet anyway. She just hates that you have the ability to eat in moderation and she resents not being able to gorge herself.", "NTA. She can dictate what does or doesn\u2019t get kept in the fridge in her own house.", "I\u2019m torn on this because you can just put the chocolate in your room, unless you live in an extremely hot climate. Chocolate doesn\u2019t go bad the way milk does. Or maybe you can hide in a bag of frozen veggies in the fridge or something like that. When you put it in front of her face it does seem a little like you\u2019re doing it on purpose. On the other hand, she doesn\u2019t have the right to dictate what you eat. I would say that kind of ESH, though not very much.", "We don't know what kind of diet she is on, she might recovering from binging disorder or have overeating issues which would mean that yes, candy bars are dangerous because they can trigger a binge. I had overeating issues and the only way that worked was just banning this stuff from the house. Now I am a bit better but I still have to hide and lock away certain foods FROM MYSELF because I cannot be trusted.", "It depends on what sister is suffering from, like if she had anything akin to binging disorder than it's a dick move. It doesn't sound like she does, but if she did it would understandable for the family to ban certain foods from the house.", "yeah NTA but definitely find a way to hide it away. Chocolate branding is designed to be crave-worthy and appetising. A little biscuit tin or a plastic bag could be the easiest way to solve this issue. \n\n[and yes, your sister should have more self control, but if say, your sister was allergic to or traumatised by a certain foodstuff, I'd give the same advice. You shouldn't _have_ to tiptoe around your sister, but you certainly _could_.]", "However do talk about your sister in depth about the last suggestion! If she doesn't want any snack or junk food in the house because she has some eating issues this offer might not work out well for her.", "Can you put it in a box?", "If sister had a disorder OP probably would've mentioned it, all they said was she was on a diet due to the wedding, so the only disorder I can tell is selfishness or being a bridezilla", "They are presumably family who loves each other and live in the same.house.", "I wouldn\u2019t go without chocolate for 7 months so my sister didn\u2019t have to look at it while on a diet.", "Chocolate doesn't need a fridge? I mean if you're keeping it for long periods of time but a few months it does not need a fridge at all. I am a pastry chef who has dealt with a lot of chocolate. I'm surprised this is even an issue, keep it in your room. Seems simple.", "Hide it in the freezer. I'm sure she doesn't open that door that often.", "Unless you are in a really hot climate, chocolate does not have to be refrigerated.  Keep it in your room.  In a pest proof container (Tupperware, Rubbermaid, lots of brands) it should be fine for several months.", "Do you have siblings? I have four and Im a middle child. Yeah, all of what you said is true. She DOESN'T need to to anything. I get that. But maybe she doesn't want to start something and end up NC over something as stupid as a candy bar. Maybe she's trying not to be petty and to keep the peace with her sister.", "Former binge eater here as well\u2026the fact that OP\u2019s sister can\u2019t interrupt her behavior by telling herself \u201cthat chocolate is OP\u2019s\u201d seems like there\u2019s a bigger issue than just chocolate and a wedding.", "But here's why what you said about temptation bothers me. My youngest sibling (16m) is an alcoholic. When I go and visit my family, ane want any type of alcohol, I have to hide it. It can't put it in the kitchen fridge. Why? To keep the 16 year old away from that temptation. He will absolutely steal it if he can find it. \n\nNow, I shouldnt HAVE to hide alcohol, since I'm 27 and he should be able to resist the temptation. Right? I shouldn't have to inconvenience myself when he should be able to control his urges, right? He's 16, he shouldn't even BE an alcoholic, right? \n\nI could go to my mom and tell her all that. Or demand that he just NOT steal my alcohol because its my fridge too and its my stuff. Is that gonna work? I'll give you one guess. \n\nMy mom has a mini fridge in her room and keeps her door locked because he will steal any alcohol or weed he can when she isnt home. \n\nSometimes with siblings, its best to pick your battles, and do whats best for you and not escalate the situation.", "Lmao \u201cstart something up and end up NC.\u201d Now who\u2019s being ridiculous?\n\nYes. I have siblings. And like I said, I\u2019d put the candy bar somewhere discreet in the fridge and tell her not to go looking for it. Her getting married is great, but I\u2019m not responsible for her weight loss plan. If my sibling would be willing to go NC over a fucking chocolate bar, then let her. This is ridiculous. Getting married doesn\u2019t make you special. And parents capitulating to such entitled behaviour is what creates toxic dynamics where everyone has to be the \u201cbigger person\u201d and adjust their behaviour around the *irrational* sibling. \n\nLike I said. I think getting a damn fridge is a fine idea if you want a fridge for your snacks, but it\u2019s a ridiculous way to \u201cpick your battles\u201d if all you want to do is have a chocolate bar.\n\nI would also like you to explain to me how having her chocolate bar tucked discreetly in the fridge could, in any way, be described as \u201cpetty.\u201d", "It\u2019s. A. Chocolate. Bar."]}
