If there\u2019s chocolate in the house, it\u2019s bought by me. \n\nI like chocolate. I don\u2019t eat it a lot, but I do like it sometimes. It can take me a while to get through a chocolate bar.

I don\u2019t buy a lot either - just a bar at a time. \n\nMy sister told me it\u2019s fine if I eat chocolate like normal people do (she\u2019s referring to the fact that it doesn\u2019t take most people a month to eat a bar of chocolate) but since I take so long it\u2019s hard for her to resist because she sees it in the fridge everyday.  \n\nI ask her what she would like me to do. Whether she would like me to buy those individually wrapped chocolates and not an entire bar. She said no, she would like me to stop keeping chocolate in the house until her wedding, like our parents agreed to do as well. \nShe said I can eat it outside of the house, but she doesn\u2019t want it inside at all. \n\nI told her that\u2019s a bit unfair and that I don\u2019t agree.

I\u2019ve always eaten chocolate like this but she\u2019s never had an issue with it.

Your sister has no right to demand that you change your eating habits. Also she has no right to eat your chocolate even if she gets crazy cravings. That's your property.

Chocolate does not typically need to be in the fridge unless you live in a really hot country I guess... Could you keep the chocolate somewhere else? Hide it somewhere? Hide it in an empty tub of butter or something so you can keep it in the fridge without her noticing?
