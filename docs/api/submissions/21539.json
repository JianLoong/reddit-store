That way nobody ends up being hurt, you can grow your career in other places if it doesn't work out", "I won\u2019t call you an asshole. You won\u2019t be one either way.\n\nHowever, I do think it\u2019s better to tell him. He might want to know he has a psyco girlfriend, and he might even break up with her which would be a win for him. \n\nBy the way, my experience is people who send these kind of texts are very vindictive besides just jealous. If a ridiculous rumour suddenly spreads about you, don\u2019t look far for the source\u2026", "People seem to disagree but YTA. \n\nSomeone you consider a friend is I'm a relationship with a toxic person and you know this and have the proof. But you rather keep them in the dark (because you have no idea if he knows this is how she behaves). \n\nSo you rather risk your friend staying in a toxic relationship just to build up your twitch numbers.  You're using him and that's messed up", "Are you sure it's his GF? Maybe you should ask him--do you know a so and so? I got a bizarre text from her today. NTA", "YWBTA if you don't tell Mike. You say he is your friend. At this point you are lying by omission. His gf sounds unhinged, but what happens next has to be up to him.", "NTA\n\nThe gf clearly has some serious issues so having a conversation with your friend about it should be the first priority. If you tell him about it he won\u2019t necessarily cancel the collaboration you guys had planned, but it will give him a serious wake up call and some thinking to do about his relationship because the girlfriend\u2019s behavior is just unacceptable and wrong. \n\nIf all goes well then hopefully you\u2019ll get a chance to explain to the girlfriend that you do not pose as a threat and your simply a friend with no other interests. Who knows, maybe after you get to know her you\u2019ll gain a new friend, but before that can happen, talk. To. Your. Friend. He needs to know! Hope everything goes well with your friend and your dreams of being a big streamer!", "YTA \n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t you tell Mike? She threatens you and your first thought is your career? What about what she could do to Mikes if she threatens other people? You\u2019re the AH for putting your career and clout above Mike, you don\u2019t deserve to ride his coattails tbh. \n\nYou need to tell him and tell him you understand if he doesn\u2019t want you in the show anymore to keep the peace at home, however this is alarming as she has no reason to act this way toward me you and you hope she hasn\u2019t done that to others he tried to work with in the past and in the future.", "Don\u2019t give in to the gf for her insane demands, but you should let him know prior. You are scared he will think you are using him for clout, but you ARE using him for clout. Let him know about it and see what happens, but don\u2019t abuse your friendship with him for exposure only to immediately afterward reveal such horrible news to him. It will definitely come across as you clout chasing", "Drama will ensue if you wait until after the collaboration.  Although, drama is going to happen with that gf anyway.  If you value the friendship (which may provide other opportunities in the future), tell him what his crazy gf is doing now, not later.", "NTA for feeling the way you do however you should really speak to him about the situation before the collaboration. I know it\u2019s important to you but if the only reason you\u2019re not telling him is because he might not want to collaborate anymore then it is almost like you\u2019re using him for clout.  And like you said, if he finds out after the collab it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll lose a friend.", "YWNBTA if you said something to him about it, but you can walk a fine line by the way you tell it. You could ask him if he was aware that his gf had your number. Tell him that you think she doesn't approve of the two of you communicating and she told you that over text. Ask him kindly if there was anything you might have done to give his gf the idea that you were interested in him and apolgize if you had. (Put it back on her that way)\n\nYou don't have to go into details about the level of the texts at this point. Just be \"concerned\" that you may have somehow offended/worried her. The rest will come out when he asks her about it and it won't be on you.", "I don\u2019t think pretending it didn\u2019t happen is going to make this go away, and you\u2019re correct in thinking it will make you look like you\u2019re using Mike if you wait til after the show to tell him. You\u2019re also telling the Girlfriend it\u2019s okay to harass and i intimidate women who are being completely with your boyfriend.\n\nScreenshot the text with the number and text it to him, saying, \u201cHi, Mike, this is awkward but if my significant other was sending texts like this to you I would want to know. I\u2019m not sure if either of you have the wrong impression, but my interest in you is just creative and professional", "YTA.\n\nYour friend's gf is fucking unhinged and making threats. He needs to know this and so do the police.\n\nBut you're sitting on it because \"exposure\".\n\nJesus fucking Christ...", "NTA. \n\nIt isn't your responsibility to tattle to Mike about his GF's harassment if there's nothing in it for you in terms of doing so (before OR after the show, to be honest). It is your right to take him (the person you are interacting with) at his word about whether he wants to interact with you and to ignore random covert threats from people you haven't even met. If were ever to find out on his own and bring it up with you -- which I doubt he'd do since he'd probably be super embarrassed to discover she was doing this -- you could just say you ignored them because you didn't feel like their relationship problems were your business.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your problem.  \n\nYou\u2019re not doing anything wrong - it\u2019s almost a business arrangement.\n\nIf his gf has an issue, she can take it up with her boyfriend.  It\u2019s very telling that she\u2019s trying to intimidate you rather than air her problems with him. \n\nStay out of it, don\u2019t get involved in her drama.", "YWBTA Your friend deserves better from you and from his stalker.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He should know what's going on and she clearly has a lot of issues. You WILL be using him to intentionally hide it only until after he does something for you.

There may be steps the both of you need to take to protect yourselves. You would absolutely be an asshole to keep this from him. And you waiting until after the show to tell him would just prove that you are using him to bump your numbers and don't actually give a damn about him. If you actually care about his safety and your own, tell him now.", "This is what I'm thinking. Streaming can sometimes come with stalkers, in which case he should absolutely be made aware of this person.", "Just curious, your whole comment is saying how she should tell her friend.

You\u2019d be the AH. \u201cMike\u201d may not have any idea his GF was acting immature and territorial.

However with this girl acting a fool it\u2019ll be hard to gain the \u201cright\u201d exposure after she starts on her bullshit. I\u2019d personally tell your friend and show him the proof of her going nuts on you. If he\u2019s really your friend he will know that the accusations are unfounded and hopefully take your side. Be a decent person, even when it means losing what you\u2019ve worked so hard for.", "YWBTAH\u2026assuming that the number that contacted you is his GF at all, keeping this alarming behavior from your friend is not ok. he needs to know what he\u2019s getting himself into, what he chooses to do with the information is up to him. and if this person is being fr, that could put not only your safety at risk but others too cuz your probably not the first person they\u2019ve threatened and most likely won\u2019t be the last. i truly hope everything goes how u want it to\u2026stay safe :)"]}
