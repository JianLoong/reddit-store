Let\u2019s call my coworker Pam (not her real name) Pam has been working with me for a few months now and it\u2019s really clear that she doesn\u2019t know how to think on her own. Her mom still packs her lunch and she drives her to work when it rains. Now Pam does not have any sort of disability or delays. She is very much able to do everything on her own but has been coddled her whole life. Now her mother has gotten a job offer in another country. Pam has mad it clear she doesn\u2019t want to move and will be staying here if one of her older siblings adopt her. \n\nShe had 3 older siblings (45,42,37). Pam is the youngest and was adopted from another country at the age of 3.   \n\nI told her that it\u2019s so sweet that she will be living with a sibling, but I asked her what she meant by adopting her since she is 26 and the legal age is 21. She says that she needs to be adopted to stay because who\u2019s going to take care of her since her mom is leaving. I asked her to explain\u2026 this woman doesn\u2019t pay any bills. She has no idea how to cook for herself or live on her own. I asked her if there\u2019s a reason why she can\u2019t live on her own. She told me that it was too hard and it\u2019s better if someone just takes responsibility for her. I told her that the only way they can \u201cadopt her\u201d is if she releases her rights to her siblings and the court would have to determine if she is incapable to be on her own. She told me \u201cthat\u2019s fine I don\u2019t want to be responsible to be on my own.\u201d I asked why she has a job then, and she basically told me she works to fund her shopping lifestyle. She has the latest phone, gets the newest purses, always comes to work with a $7 coffee, and has really nice clothes. I asked why she doesn\u2019t just budget her money better so she can live on her own. She looked at me like I was crazy\u2026 I flat out told her that her siblings would not be smart for adopting her because there\u2019s no reason to be adopted. This made her mad and she reported me to HR. I now have to write an apology memo and submit it to her by Tuesday. Now I\u2019m thinking I should have stayed out of it, but this girl has no idea how the world works.

That\u2019s just about the worst age to be adopted: old enough to understand, too young to communicate effectively, peak emotional intensity, no control over what is happening to her. So it is plausible that she is damaged by early trauma. I have a niece adopted at that age, a sweet girl with a job and apartment, and moving her to independence has been pretty nearly a full time job for her parents for the last decade. Every successful step is celebrated and she is making progress, but if they didn\u2019t stay in there she would fall apart. It\u2019s not her fault. \n\nYou are N T A because she asked, you answered.

Fully functional adults can be adopted. This usually happens for emotional reasons, since legal custody isn\u2019t the point. But it is also possible that she has been legally ruled in need of long term guardianship. \n\nIt is unlikely that her mother broke her by coddling her. More likely, she\u2019s doing the best she can with a hurt child who grew into a dysfunctional adult. The family can decide how to best assist her when mom moves. Your opinion on that is best kept to yourself.

She is so spoilt her own mother is so done with looking after her she\u2019s moving to another country to get away from her and she still expects others to run around after her. If her mother wanted to continue to look after her she wouldn\u2019t have looked for jobs in other countries, she made it deliberately unappealing to her daughter knowing she won\u2019t move.

Atp it's on coworker/coworkers family to improve their personal dynamics.", "Adopting a 26 year old doesn\u2019t make you responsible for taking care of them though. Unless there is something we don\u2019t know about Pam.", "I don't think it's unreasonable to point out that there might be potential legal complications of what Pam was talking about. And I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for clarification when Pam was talking to OP about a really unusual life situation. But the attitude of \"Then why don't you just budget better?\" to someone who has clearly never had to worry about budgeting before in her life and therefore hasn't learned the skills to do that is fucking useless and insulting. It's like saying \"why don't you just drive to work?\" to someone who has never touched the steering wheel in their life. It's a way oversimplification of a problem, that glosses straight past whatever anxieties and sense of dependency that anyone in a situation like Pam's would have, and for that I'm going to call OP TA.", "This is probably a bit different for my job because I'm a dog groomer and the girls in our shop are very much a team but... we know a lot about each other and basically no conversation topic is off limits lol. Politics(which we fortunately all agree on), how we feel about the stupid shit each other does, etc lol. This person sounds overly sensitive and like they only keep yes men in their life and people like that are beyond help. Unless her parents and siblings set her straight she's going nowhere in life and she'll probably end up homeless or some rich old man's trophy wife. Idk why her coworker even tried to say anything but I do think this person needs to hear it more often \ud83d\ude06", "I don't think what OP has described falls under the legal requirements of a hostile work environment. Being an adult who prefers to live as a dependent is not a protected characteristic. And nothing OP said makes it unsafe for Pam to continue working there. \n\nSure, many employers will reprimand you for not keeping the peace. But that doesn't make this a hostile work environment under the legal sense.", "Yes. This comment section is a wreck.", "OP asked. She didn't \"dump on\" OP.", "Me either. But if that saves her job so be it. I am not even sure I know if this scenario is made up because it is ridiculous.", "It\u2019s sad and weird to me how many people think a 26 year old who truly believes she needs a legal guardian is just coddled and lazy and not possibly delayed/neurodivergent/mentally unwell", "I feel sorry for you that your manager is that disrespectful and that you don't understand how or why you deserve better.", "Shouldn\u2019t you also not vent about something personal enough at work you\u2019d take offense to someone responding to you ?\n\nLike do you just want your coworkers to act as silent receptors to your venting?? Most people will try and have a conversation , to ease the awkwardness of someone emotionally dumping on them , and that often turns into advice.", "In some companies, HR\u2019s overarching policy is CYA.  Their involvement is really not determinative of whether a complaint has any substantive merit.  Making OP write an apology letter - exactly what my first-grader and his classmates are made to do by their teacher when one six-year-old steals another six-year-old\u2019s crayon without asking - is consistent with this.  \u201cPlease give us documentation for the file to prove that we took action on this matter.  You know.  Just in case we have to answer a future subpoena.\u201d", "Why?", "It\u2019s 100% some soft US paper towel people stuff. Here we just have to acknowledge that some people just need to be strictly work conversations Pam seems like one of those.", "I always thought it was Everyone is Shitty Here. Close!", "It\u2019s defined in the subreddit sidebar/voting rules officially \u201cEveryone Sucks Here\u201d but equally shared holery is pretty funny. Haven\u2019t heard that one before.", "I like that it\u2019s funnier than the original meaning \ud83e\udd23", "Because not everything is a result of mental health issues. Sometimes people are really just that lazy/entitled/coddled.", "I would agree, however it looks like OP dug into Pam's story more than Pam originally offered. Like Pam complained about moving or needing to be adopted and OP kept asking why. \n\nIf Pam were asking for advice, then OP is NTA. If pam was just casually venting then ESH (because it's a weird, personal topic to bring up at work).", "Pam was offended when told she basically had to learn to be an adult and be responsible for her own life", "If you don't feel comfortable telling a coworker that you did not want their advice, and you need mediation, that's the job of HR", "You\u2019re not wrong and the downvotes are weird", "I think we can agree on that! \n\nI get a little hair trigger on this sorta thing cause I\u2019ve been like trapped at my desk before by people who just love to overshare about topics I really don\u2019t want to know.", "Same here, cant believe this shit happens. HR is for work problems not oh no so and so wore the same top as me today \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "If it\u2019s not evident that she has a disability, I doubt HR would scurry over to OP and disclose Pam\u2019s medical issues to a co-worker who committed the heinous offense of expressing an opinion.  I mean, I don\u2019t know.  I\u2019m not an employment law practitioner or anything (I don\u2019t even have an academic interest in it); I\u2019m just having a hard time seeing why HR chose to get involved in this situation. As this is being told from OP\u2019s POV, however, I guess it\u2019s entirely possible they\u2019re omitting some key facts that might not be in their favor.", "\n>I'm brave enough to tell you that you don't have the right to advise me on my life. \n\nAnd? She can still decide how to live her life. \n\nYou can listen different opinions on any subject and still stick to yours. Or are you so fragile that no one can say anything about your life to you? Even when you are wrong?\n\nI still don't understand why this is an HR matter. Around here it wouldn't be. No one was mistreated, i just see a conversation about life.  C'mon dude let's be real be adopted at 26 by your brother????", "It's was not unsolicited. From the moment u share something with other people u should expect a normal reaction, like normal people. If u don't want advice or judgement, my etiquette says u should start that way. Something on the lines of \"I need to vent\".\n\nI can't see it any other way. If the coworker doesn't want to discuss it why bring it up on the 1st place.", "Agree. Adoptees also can sometimes have very bad boundaries due to adoptive parents sharing their entire life story with randos their entire lives, making it seem like we need to explain ourselves to anyone and everyone. Some of us just pick up on the bad boundaries and don\u2019t even realize it until we address it in therapy.", "Me too and I have been the Pam, wondering why my coworkers are looking at me like I'm speaking a foreign language.", "Of course you say \u201cthat dress is ugly\u201d", "I've also noticed that some people, when they find out my nephew is adopted, will ask him outrageously personal questions even though they hardly know him. Fortunately his parents shut it down and taught him how to shut it down himself, but it's so creepy!", "They can\u2019t use her disability as a reason to punish OP if literally no one at work but possibly HR and the family know she has a disability. Though it sounds like a heck of a place to work.", "Still wouldn't fly. Insulting your coworker's appearance by calling what they're wearing ugly won't fly in a workplace", "I don\u2019t care, it\u2019s called my opinion. If you\u2019re that fragile keep your opinion based questions to yourself.", "I genuinely do not give a fuck how you feel about some imaginary person's dress, I'm telling you how the real world works. If your job is less important than some useless insults, that's your business, I don't care if you want to be unemployed. Stop treating everything like a personal attack, it makes you look defensive"]}
