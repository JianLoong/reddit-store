I have a niece adopted at that age, a sweet girl with a job and apartment, and moving her to independence has been pretty nearly a full time job for her parents for the last decade.

However while she doesn\u2019t understand how the world works, you don\u2019t understand how adoption works; your \u201cinformation\u201d on adult adoption is wrong. Fully functional adults can be adopted. This usually happens for emotional reasons, since legal custody isn\u2019t the point. But it is also possible that she has been legally ruled in need of long term guardianship. \n\nIt is unlikely that her mother broke her by coddling her. More likely, she\u2019s doing the best she can with a hurt child who grew into a dysfunctional adult. The family can decide how to best assist her when mom moves. Your opinion on that is best kept to yourself. You should apologize for overstepping, because apologizing is always the right call when we unintentionally hurt someone.", "YTA- she's an idiot, really not prepared for life, and her parents set her up for failure and/or abuse. I've met ppl like her, and the partners they attract (or family member willing to take over) aren't usually very nice. Despite all of that, it wasn't your place to say anything about it, especially not in the middle of work. Let her make her choices, and what happens happens.", "NTA. Should you have just stayed out of it? Yeah, probably. But she did consult you about this, and everything you said was right. You having to write an apology over this makes me wonder what kind of narrative she spun to HR.", "NTA-u spoke truth she didn\u2019t want to hear-can\u2019t believe u got in trouble for this-but guess that\u2019s the stupid world we live in now", "ESH ONLY because it wasn\u2019t your place to say but I wouldn\u2019t speak to her again about anything non work related. \n\nYou are 100% right. She\u2019s is capable of having a full time job, admits she does it just so she can go shopping, clearly able to manage personal hygiene,  travelling, fully capable of holding conversations and doing day to day tasks, she is just spoilt. She is so spoilt her own mother is so done with looking after her she\u2019s moving to another country to get away from her and she still expects others to run around after her. If her mother wanted to continue to look after her she wouldn\u2019t have looked for jobs in other countries, she made it deliberately unappealing to her daughter knowing she won\u2019t move. Many people who have mental health issues and can function like that are fully able to take care of themselves but it\u2019s clear she just doesn\u2019t want to. Her parents have done her a disservice and haven\u2019t taught her to stand on her own. \n\nLife is hard, I can\u2019t stress how hard it can be especially if you struggle with mental issues but they are YOUR issues. There\u2019s nothing wrong with asking for help but it is 100% your responsibility to take care of yourself. If you are capable of doing what she does, then you are capable of taking care of yourself. Its a tough lesson to learn but she\u2019s going to have to learn to do it. Her siblings would be fools to continue enabling her. Do I hate having to do all the mundane \u201cadult\u201d responsibilities? Yes of course I do, who doesn\u2019t? But the fact of life is that you have to.\n\nStay well away and any personal conversations she starts reply with \u201cI am sorry but unless it\u2019s work related I do not wish to continue this conversation\u201d and if she does report her.", "NTA.... And I'll tell you why... Because she needs to hear it..\nYeah you gotta write an empty apology.... But id be applying to other jobs... And just quit... And if you say \"2 week notice\".  Will they give you two weeks if you're gonna be fired?... No so just find another job and just at the end of business the day before you start the new job just turn in your stuff to hr and leave... You owe them nothing.", "INFO: How do you she doesn't have any disabilities?", "NTA the co worker's family is . This poor girl is going to be so lost when siblings spouse get sick of her and kick her out.", "YTA for the unsolicited and harsh advise. Everything you said was true but she didn\u2019t ask you what you thought she should do. Give her an apology and let life chew her up and spit her out. She\u2019ll learn quickly that no one is going to be willing to cater to and coddle her like her parents unfortunately she\u2019ll find out the hard way", "Not your circus. Her adoptive family failed to teach her how to survive in the world without them. To me, that's abusive. They skipped teaching her how to be independent.\n\nIt's not of your business. Leave her and her existence alone. It doesn't affect your work in the slightest. Let her use her money how she pleases. Stick to talking about work only, from now onwards.", "NTA \u201cI apologize you\u2019re a very lazy human and want to pass on your responsibilities to someone else\u201d sounds like an acceptable one to me. Thank god we don\u2019t have an HR, it be apology letters every day \ud83d\ude02", "INFO: Did she open up to you or did you volunteer your opinion?", "Most never want to grow up.  Let her learn.", "NTA. You didn't walk up to her and hand her this information. She started a conversation with you about it. It's fine for people not to enjoy every conversation that they have. That wasn't harassment and it was inappropriate of her to go to HR for it. It's also inappropriate of HR to ask you to write an apology letter about it. However, I'm wondering about your statement that she doesn't have any disabilities. Disabilities can be invisible, and the way she behaves and thinks isn't typical.", "YTA because you should have stayed out of it. It's literally none of your business and affects you in no way. It's flat out insane though and you are right. HR is ridiculous for making you apologise. This is the kind of thing you just watch from a distance while enjoying your popcorn. I hope you let us know if she does indeed get adopted by one of her older siblings and they start driving her to work in the rain.", "Justified asshole. I probably would\u2019ve wanted to do the same thing, but when it comes down to it, it\u2019s not your business. That unfortunately puts you in the  YTA category. \n\nShe is an entitled fool, so I suggest you just sit back with popcorn and watch it unfold. Just keep your mouth closed.", "Nta, she's going to find out quick that's not how the real world works. Glad someone finally told her the honest truth, but looks like she won't belive it", "Best avatar", "She sounds like a worthless person indeed. At 26 she needs a sugar daddy, not an adoption.", "*politely change the subject and immediately report her to HR for infringing on your professional space.  Take that mama\u2019s girl! Apology time!", "True about maybe they don't want your feedback.  But gow about if you don't want feedback don't vent to me?  Sorry, I had to vent. ;)\n\nI would have had a tough time not getting involved in this because it's just bizarre.  Like, did I hear what you said correctly?  Why would you do that?  What happens when your caretaker dies?  It would be like being sucked into a weird wiki article that keeps linking to stranger stuff.\n\nI get that this is a work environment and standards are different but the op needs to find out exactly why she is being made to apologize.  This other person has such a weird entitlement issue that I would be sure to check the accuracy of her statement to hr.  Course just apologizing, learning from the experience, and then just not engage with this person again may be the best/easiest response in the long run.", "Wrong. The coworker clearly came to her to consult. You can't ask someone for their opinion and then get insulted when they deliver.", "winning answer.", "Yeah there's a way to address awkward vibrating about other people's lives without going into the reality of how you think they should live.  The professional response would be \"oh... really? You don't say... So I'm just curious, why? Oh...I see. Well all the best and hope that works out for ya!\"", "Probably just going by what the coworker said herself. She had said she just didn\u2019t want to be responsible for herself and only works to find her lifestyle. If she does have any delay or disability she is discrediting it by openly admitting that she just doesn\u2019t want to be responsible for herself. That is how I perceive it.", "This is the answer I was looking for. My autism wasn't diagnosed until I was 38 years old and even then people who learned of my diagnosis kept responding with, \"Well, but you're BARELY autistic, right?\" Their perception was that I must not be significantly disabled because I was very bright and articulate.\n\nThe truth was that I was unable to live independently until I was over 30 years old. And even after that, I needed significant supports. And until I got my diagnosis, we really didn't even understand WHY I struggled so badly with so many things. \n\nYou cannot tell from looking at someone, or from the fact that they have a job, that they \"aren't disabled\" or \"don't have any deficits\".\n\nOP mentions that she was adopted as a young child. Many adoptees have trauma, and developmental deficits due to attachment disorders, early abuse or malnutrition, or all kinds of other issues that OP wouldn't have thought of, that can affect them well into adulthood. Beyond that, some of the most brilliant people I know struggle with learning and developmental disorders that make it difficult for them to live entirely independently, though you'd never know it if you were just their work colleague or a casual friend.", "The problem is they are co-workers AT WORK. When you are at work, you cannot be Honest McBrutal unless you want to be fired. When people ask you about their politics, religion, or issues that you're going to be brutal on, change the topic. It's for your own good.", "You're forgetting that OP has no right to speak to a coworker this way and, in fact, most employers, especially in the US where I'm a manager, would be required to reprimand OP for being a dingus because it creates a hostile working environment, even if you mistakenly think OP was ok to do this. \n\nI would also do it willingly because this is not in any way acceptable or appropriate in a place of employment. If she was my friend, I'd have read her to filth, but God forbid one of my employees acted like OP at work, they'd probably lose their job over it.", "\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25", "It depends on how much she shared unsolicited by OP, imo.", "Especially since the advice about adult adoption is totally wrong. Source: adopted adult who was adopted without releasing rights or being ruled incompetent in any way. Adult adoption will sever the parental relationship between the coworker and her mom, but that\u2019s it.", "Everyone sucks here.", "Everybody sucks here", "Shouldn't both be reported in this scenario? The person sharing inappropriate conversations seems to be at fault as well...\n\nIt's a tough world out there, lots of unintended mine fields .", "The best response would have been to either listen silently if op doesn\u2019t mind, or to redirect the conversation back to work related matters.\n\nIf this hadn\u2019t happened at work I would see no problem, but since it did I suggest people live by the rule of keeping personal and professional separate. Even when someone else fails to do so", "I feel there\u2019s a possibility that this person is not really capable of understanding the give-and-take nature of a conversation. So they\u2019re essentially just describing their situation, but they were probably surprised that someone pointed out that they weren\u2019t really looking at it in a healthy way. \n\nI feel like you and I are similar, this would drive me insane as well, especially because I am myself an international adoptee, but I also have grown to realize that you really just have to let it go. I\u2019ve never in my life encountered a time when someone was happy that I elbowed in with my opinion like OP.", ">  The coworker clearly came to her to consult.\n\nCan you quote that part of the OP, please?", "It's actually not clear that Pam was asking for advice. There are simply things I don't discuss at work because people like OP will try to give unsolicited advice. OP doesn't seem to recognize venting or chitchat.", "You're missing the key part of \"coworker\" that indicates a workplace was involved. \n\nI can say to a coworker \"do you hate me for my skin color\" and I am violating HR policy. If they say yes, they are also now in violation.\n\nEdit to also say, nowhere did OP say the coworker requested consultation. That makes OP wrong as a friend or a coworker.", "The person never asked OP for their opinion though. She was venting about her situation, not looking for advice.", ">I asked her what she meant  \n>  \n>I asked her to explain\n\nHow is it clear that the coworker came to OP to consult?  I read it as the Pam was wittering on and OP decided to ask a lot of questions and then started in making comments.", "Where does OP make that clear?", "If you read the post, you will notice most of the details came from OP's decision to ask additional, very personal, follow up questions to Pam's initial statement.", "Thanks!", "I always read it as Equally Shared -Holery. Can never remember what it actually means.", "Hey no need to be mean, they were just asking a question, and I don\u2019t know what the rest of us did to deserve that!\n\n/s", "If I don't have safe, happy, people on my team, they aren't going to do their best.", "Exactly this. I had a coworker, long before I became a manager, who would vent to me about his marriage because I was kind enough to listen, but I never agreed or not with anything he said, and especially never gave input. \n\nHe thought I was agreeing and asked me to testify during his divorce, but because I recognized boundaries, I said I didn't know anything other than what he told me, which wouldn't help in court, and that was that. He didn't ask twice. Nobody got insulted, though my work life was getting stressful hearing about it from him, but I try to let people I like vent. Had he asked for advice, I may have given it, but since I wasn't married I'd have been limited given that I, like OP, didn't have enough context of my own to really contribute.", "I am not in the US. It doesn't work like that where I'm from. But if what you say is true, then shouldn't the adopted coworker also write an apology memo to OP? \ud83e\udd14", "We didn\u2019t see the interaction to see what kind of social cues were going on.  It could\u2019ve been awkward prying, or a regular conversation with some unusual subject matter.  In text form, the questions seem to logically follow from the information shared.", "Right? I hadn\u2019t even commented yet, and I\u2019m being told I suck!\n\n/s", "it\u2019s just so weird how people seem to do better in supportive, professional environments, isn\u2019t it?\n\ni\u2019ve seen so many people start power-tripping because \u201cthey\u2019re the boss now\u201d and it\u2019s like, congratulations duder, you played yourself. my work experience has been one long object lesson in the fact that usually the most easily-replaced person on a team is\u2026 the manager, and that\u2019s usually the best bang for the buck repairing a dysfunctional environment.", "Hey can you come and be my manager? Or at least give them lessons on how to be one?\n\nMine seem to bounce between complete ineptitude and zero caring.", "No because OP is not part of a protected class being insulted.\n\nEdit to clarify, neither is the coworker, so the person who feels targeted and attacked for their lifestyle is going to come out on top. \n\nAn apology letter is hardly a punishment for something that is hardly more than OPs poor judgement in what topics to discuss at work.", "Yes, but whatever the situation it's clear that very little of what was shared by the co-worker was unsolicited. OP deliberately solicited a great deal of personal information and then gave their co-worker unsolicited advice.", "When you know, you know.\n\nLol.", "It ain't an easy job. That's not an excuse though. All you can do sometimes is pay it forward, learn your lessons from them, and don't repeat their mistakes without acknowledgement or apology when the time comes that you will make them.\n\nIf you think they're just a little daft, but might actually take feedback well, check out the HBR guide to managing up."]}
