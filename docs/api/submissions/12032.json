Her mom still packs her lunch and she drives her to work when it rains. Now Pam does not have any sort of disability or delays. She is very much able to do everything on her own but has been coddled her whole life. Now her mother has gotten a job offer in another country. Pam has mad it clear she doesn\u2019t want to move and will be staying here if one of her older siblings adopt her. \n\nShe had 3 older siblings (45,42,37). Pam is the youngest and was adopted from another country at the age of 3.   \n\nI told her that it\u2019s so sweet that she will be living with a sibling, but I asked her what she meant by adopting her since she is 26 and the legal age is 21. She says that she needs to be adopted to stay because who\u2019s going to take care of her since her mom is leaving. I asked her to explain\u2026 this woman doesn\u2019t pay any bills. She has no idea how to cook for herself or live on her own. I asked her if there\u2019s a reason why she can\u2019t live on her own. She told me that it was too hard and it\u2019s better if someone just takes responsibility for her. I told her that the only way they can \u201cadopt her\u201d is if she releases her rights to her siblings and the court would have to determine if she is incapable to be on her own. She told me \u201cthat\u2019s fine I don\u2019t want to be responsible to be on my own.\u201d I asked why she has a job then, and she basically told me she works to fund her shopping lifestyle. She has the latest phone, gets the newest purses, always comes to work with a $7 coffee, and has really nice clothes. I asked why she doesn\u2019t just budget her money better so she can live on her own. She looked at me like I was crazy\u2026 I flat out told her that her siblings would not be smart for adopting her because there\u2019s no reason to be adopted.

It's not like your went out of your way to discover how this girl is financing her life and if she doesn't want advice she shouldnt dump her problems to coworker.

Yes, it was. Does this make you an asshole? Absolutely not!", "NTA you shouldn't have responded but then your coworker shouldn't have dumped on you. You meant well.

An adult doesn't need to be declared gravely disabled to be adopted. Usually adult adoption is either a symbolic act or used as a way to guarantee inheritance. You described a conservatorship. That may be what she meant, and she just didn't know the word for it.", "YTA\n\nDo I think she needs to be adopted? No, I think she meant to say, she needs a legal guardian or something?\n\nBut her family arrangement isn't important to you, as long as she isn't abused", "Yta\n\n\nShe clearly has problems.

No.", "Soft YTA, but I get where your coming from.", "YTA\n\nyes you are correct in what you said but she was just venting at the office and not asking or wanting an opinion or advice.

Even if you were her doctor, you are not  a team of specialists  so you do NOT know.  \n\nEven you are lawyer with adoption specialisation you  better not be her lawyer after you told us all that.\n\nFor some people  adoption signifies family.

Either way though, just because you personally do not see anything on the surface, that does not at all mean there isn't something beneath. There are so many hidden disabilities, and being someone who has hidden disabilities, most untrained people could also look at me and say there is nothing wrong.\n\nEspecially if she's told you that it's \"too hard\" for her to live by herself, that should be a massive hint to you that something isn't quite right as most fit adults are fine living by themselves.", "YTA because none of this is your business.
