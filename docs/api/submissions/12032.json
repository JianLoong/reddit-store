I have a niece adopted at that age, a sweet girl with a job and apartment, and moving her to independence has been pretty nearly a full time job for her parents for the last decade.

However while she doesn\u2019t understand how the world works, you don\u2019t understand how adoption works; your \u201cinformation\u201d on adult adoption is wrong. Fully functional adults can be adopted. This usually happens for emotional reasons, since legal custody isn\u2019t the point. But it is also possible that she has been legally ruled in need of long term guardianship. \n\nIt is unlikely that her mother broke her by coddling her. More likely, she\u2019s doing the best she can with a hurt child who grew into a dysfunctional adult. The family can decide how to best assist her when mom moves. Your opinion on that is best kept to yourself. You should apologize for overstepping, because apologizing is always the right call when we unintentionally hurt someone.", "YTA- she's an idiot, really not prepared for life, and her parents set her up for failure and/or abuse. I've met ppl like her, and the partners they attract (or family member willing to take over) aren't usually very nice. Despite all of that, it wasn't your place to say anything about it, especially not in the middle of work. Let her make her choices, and what happens happens.", "NTA. Should you have just stayed out of it? Yeah, probably. But she did consult you about this, and everything you said was right. You having to write an apology over this makes me wonder what kind of narrative she spun to HR.", "NTA-u spoke truth she didn\u2019t want to hear-can\u2019t believe u got in trouble for this-but guess that\u2019s the stupid world we live in now", "ESH ONLY because it wasn\u2019t your place to say but I wouldn\u2019t speak to her again about anything non work related. \n\nYou are 100% right. She\u2019s is capable of having a full time job, admits she does it just so she can go shopping, clearly able to manage personal hygiene,  travelling, fully capable of holding conversations and doing day to day tasks, she is just spoilt. She is so spoilt her own mother is so done with looking after her she\u2019s moving to another country to get away from her and she still expects others to run around after her. If her mother wanted to continue to look after her she wouldn\u2019t have looked for jobs in other countries, she made it deliberately unappealing to her daughter knowing she won\u2019t move. Many people who have mental health issues and can function like that are fully able to take care of themselves but it\u2019s clear she just doesn\u2019t want to. Her parents have done her a disservice and haven\u2019t taught her to stand on her own. \n\nLife is hard, I can\u2019t stress how hard it can be especially if you struggle with mental issues but they are YOUR issues. There\u2019s nothing wrong with asking for help but it is 100% your responsibility to take care of yourself. If you are capable of doing what she does, then you are capable of taking care of yourself. Its a tough lesson to learn but she\u2019s going to have to learn to do it. Her siblings would be fools to continue enabling her. Do I hate having to do all the mundane \u201cadult\u201d responsibilities? Yes of course I do, who doesn\u2019t?

Disabilities can be invisible, and the way she behaves and thinks isn't typical.", "YTA because you should have stayed out of it. It's literally none of your business and affects you in no way. It's flat out insane though and you are right. HR is ridiculous for making you apologise. This is the kind of thing you just watch from a distance while enjoying your popcorn.

I probably would\u2019ve wanted to do the same thing, but when it comes down to it, it\u2019s not your business.

Well all the best and hope that works out for ya!\"\n\nEdit to fix autocorrect.", "Probably just going by what the coworker said herself. She had said she just didn\u2019t want to be responsible for herself and only works to find her lifestyle.

And even after that, I needed significant supports.

I avoid talking to anyone about anything but work for this reason because if they take it wrong suddenly you\u2019re the problem", "I\u2019m sorry you came to me with an issue and didn\u2019t like my advice. \n\nNTA.", "Prob why her mom is moving overseas", "To me it sounds very likely that she has an issue or disability of some sort.", "OP is the one that asked the questions and inserted their opinion where it wasn't wanted. All the coworker did was answer the questions. That's not dumping on someone.\n\nIf you don't want real answers, then don't ask prying questions.", "At first she wasn't rude. However when she said this \n\n>I asked why she has a job then, and she basically told me she works to fund her shopping lifestyle. She has the latest phone, gets the newest purses, always comes to work with a $7 coffee, and has really nice clothes. I asked why she doesn\u2019t just budget her money better so she can live on her own. She looked at me like I was crazy\u2026 I flat out told her that her siblings would not be smart for adopting her because there\u2019s no reason to be adopted. \n\nThat is rude and unacceptable in a work environment.\n\nAlso you cannot assume someone is or isn't neurodivergent or not", "Fuck that. She needs to hear it and clearly no one else in her life is telling her. NTA", "So this woman was right to go to HR over this?", "Being spoiled and entitled isn't a developmental disability.", "How do you know that all AH's in this sub don't have mental conditions that makes them behave like an AH.  You go with the info you have on the post.", "If it's in the US you don't need any circumstances for adult adoption, you can just do it because you want to.", "This. And reddit is full of this crap.", "Sooo. Don't ask opinions about it if u don't want them.", "It's more this sub, than reddit in general. If you're on the webpage, there's a voting guide on the right-hand side with the definitions.", "I know. It bothers me so much that it's not EHTA (Everyone Here's The Asshole). It would be so much more intuitive", "You can always ask, but just so you know as well, sometimes subreddits have information available about their specific sub, such as rules (acceptable concent, etc), references, similar subreddits, and also sometimes lists of acronyms that are commonly used throughout. :) Just play around with the sub info, sometimes you'll be able to find FAQs there.", "If I went to my manager because my coworker stated an opinion regarding the information I had told them about myself my manager would laugh in my face and rightfully so.", "Would you do anything about the over sharing that preceded the advice?", "Agreed. It's an odd relationship, coworkers are close to us but not chosen. I guess people do their best to deal with it, screwups happen.", "Whatever. I would be so pissed off if some nitwit subjected me to her innermost thoughts while I was trying to get my job done. It would be nice to assume that a supervisor might redirect the chatty over-sharer.", "She is willing to  explain she has difficulty with daily life skills and does not hide it, which sure sounds like functional disability.  If from a  recognised  cause or not. \n\nWillingness  to have important decisions made for her at  that age when  working (and not lazy at all)  would  mesh with  a need for help.", "You\u2019re wrong. OP could have said they don\u2019t feel comfortable giving feedback on personal matters.", "Idk, this not appropriate imo. They were talking about something OP had already made a silent judgement on, it should have stayed silent. He has no idea what this woman does at home and whether she\u2019s coddled or not is really not something OP should have asked about. And it was a \u201cWHY is coddled\u201d not \u201cIS she coddled\u201d. I\u2019m not saying OP is wrong but it\u2019s not their place to really say out loud that they are judging how a coworker spends their money and free time. The adoption too. It\u2019s kinda weird, but it\u2019s one of those convos you smile and nod through. OP was judgmental  and condescending. This is a workplace. How she spends her money is NONE of OP\u2019s business and counting a coworkers coins and questioning how they live is never appropriate. That said, the punishment is weird too I think. I feel like a forced apology is like what\u2019s the point. Maybe she asked for one idk. Seems more appropriate to file formal documentation with acknowledgment that it will result in more documentation and/or termination if OP continues to make coworkers uncomfortable.\n\nI do not see where OP was asked to give their opinion. She started a conversation about her chosen family, and I see OP transitioning into expressing their judgments and then to say \u201cyou need to know how the world works\u201d. Her world works different I guess and she wasn\u2019t asking for OP to explain anything let alone *how the whole world works*. How condescending!\n\nFirm YTA for me.\n\nEdit - just noticed at parts I presumed OP\u2019s gender. Sorry! I tried to do the they thing but noticed a few \u201chis\u201d\u2019s.", "What? OP was the one asking questions. And then inserted their opinion where it wasn't wanted.", "Op describes  a 26 year old who is  gainfully employed  who says that they have  not yet mastered many basic life skills and whose family  apparently think she  needs adult guardianship of some kind...              \nWhy would she  need to hear anything negative?", "HR thought so, so yes", "Something about all these responses wasn't settling right with me and I wondered why, but you put it beautifully. I was adopted and have autism. My adoptive brother also has autism and was diagnosed basically as soon as he could be. Meanwhile, I went undiagnosed until seventh grade (which is relatively \"early\" compared to your case, but far later than I probably should've been diagnosed.)\n\nTo me, Pam doesn't seem to be spoiled, as OP seems to imply, but rather, naive or unaware. This is something I commonly experience, both as someone who grew up quite sheltered and as someone with autism. Not to say for certain that Pam has a disability, but it's not a good idea to assume she's just been spoiled or whatever.\n\nSorry OP, I think YTA here. I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say you might've genuinely wanted to help, but the workplace isn't the place for that, and honestly, sometimes it's just better to nod and agree.", "No. That's probably some US work environment. Around here, EU, people discuss all types of matters in a healthy way. If they don't want to talk about it then they don't. \n\nThis was not some random harassment made behind coworker knowledge. It was her that talked about it.", "What way? US workplace laws are.... Well what they are. This was not some bully talk. The coworker was the one that initiated this.\n\nIm in the EU, and i doubt HR would even say anything to me. They would tell the coworker that if she doesn't want opinions then don't ask for them. This was not bully or unsolicited advice.\n\nIf any manager or boss tried to fire me over this, well they couldn't.", "Geeze-- lose their job?? I would never want to work for a company that would so arbitrarily fire someone for something so minor", "You\u2019re forgetting that if you don\u2019t want someone to tell you their option don\u2019t start talking to them about something.", "You are the one making assumptions. You should judge on the info you have on the post. Every AH here could have some kind of handycap.", "True, I should have said \"can benefit from\"", "It is and it's frequently spammed here.", "Finally,  I've been trying to figure it out for ages!  Thankyou", "That's true but what does esh mean?", "Only if I was told it was bothersome, and the OP had asked Pam to stop. It sounds like OP was more nosy than bothered.", "I don't think venting about your life to a coworker is inappropriate if you know them. But if someone did in a way that was at all unsettling, upsetting, etc, to me, I would ask them to stop, not tell them how I feel about their life. \n\nIf they keep going, THEN it's a problem. \n\nOP was the only one in the wrong here. Does Pam need help? Absolutely. But is Pam doing anything worth reprimand, no.", "What some people will discuss in the break room is wild. And what done other people will feel empowered to comment on is more so. I've had great experiences with coworkers who are still dear friends, but since leaving food service? I don't tell anyone at work anything and I don't give anyone my opinion unless directly asked for it. \n\nFood service coworkers are like the people you've seen battle with. Every \"real\" job has been more like high school than the actual high schoolers I trained for weekend cashier shifts.", "Is Pam a member of a protected class?  OP indicates she\u2019s not disabled or \u201cdelayed\u201d or anything. She was adopted from a foreign country, but OP didn\u2019t say anything that was hostile or offensive about her origins.  I\u2019m confused as to what HR policy was violated here?  \u201cI told an actual adult with whom I was having a non-work related conversation that she can live independently and not be adopted by her older sibling\u201d violates what workplace rule?  How is it discriminatory?  How does it create a hostile work environment?  How is it sexual or any other type of harassment?  How is it racist/sexist/ageist/ableist, etc?  I\u2019m not sure what country this took place in, so I guess it\u2019s possible that there\u2019s a country where if you initiate a personal conversation that elicits an inoffensive opinion that you happen to dislike, that violates the sacred rule of not hurting your infantilized, delicate feelings.  Maybe!  Anything\u2019s possible.  This sure would not violate any sort of HR rule in my country.", "I'm confused why you think this is comparable to racism, could you explain?", "So you talk to me about something and don't expect input. Are you for real. If u want to vent go to a doctor or a priest", "You can't make people feel like shit because you don't agree with how they live their life.", "Where do you work? I want to make sure never to work there. This is not how polite society actually works.", "I like that better tbh, its funny", "That definitely works, too.", "Everybody sucks here /s", "Fair enough.", "In the US the phrase \"creating a hostile working environment\" is king. Pam didn't ask for input, so giving it was not appropriate.\n\nYou don't have to think it's hostile, but if Pam does, that's how it works.", "Well adopted from a foreign country means she\u2019s an immigrant to the country that she and OP are in, so that could be a protected class.", "You can't \"make\" someone feel something. The babied coworker was sharing personal info with OP, and logically that implies that she's open to comments about those issues (otherwise, don't share). \n\nAnd putting someone out of their means of surviving (job) bc of one supposed offense is WAY more problematic than some silly child getting her feelings hurt. She can't cry to mommy anymore, so she goes to HR. It's vindictive and mean. And HR shouldn't coddle such nincompoops\n\nETA: At most, HR should have advised OP not to opine about personal matters with this person again.", "Yes it is. That's the polite way. If someone talks to me about something I will reply. Same way around, if i talk to someone about something I expect their input.\n\n OP said nothing wrong or offensive. And if coworker didn't like what was said, well bad luck, next time don't ask.", "Yes she did. And that only works that way in the US. \n\nSo you say something to another person and expect them to not speak... Only in the US I'm sure.", "?? ?? ?? So if I go up to a coworker and start talking about weird stuff do I also get to report someone to HR if they don't react positively because I'm an immigrant ?? ?? ??"]}
