I'm doing well in all my other classes so it might not be that big of a deal. \n\nOn Friday, I needed to leave the room because I was getting really bad anxiety and I wanted to go for a walk. So I told the teacher I had to use the bathroom, and he said I could go at lunch and just carried on with the lesson. I tried sitting through it but I was getting heart palpitations and about to have an anxiety attack so I asked again. He told me to stop distrusting the class and my friend tried to stand up for me and told him that I needed to leave, but he told her to be quiet too. \n\nAt that, I just stood up and walked out. I didn't say anything, I just went for my walk.

I was about to do that but my friend, (who apparently walked out too to make sure I was alright) came up to her and basically told her to leave me alone. We both ended up getting in trouble, but my friends and I are planning to talk this out with a counselor sometime next week.

The teachers who respected students and allowed them to leave as needed were always respected by the students in return in my experience. You\u2019re there to learn, not be held prisoner. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this. Definitely speak to the counselor", "NTA. Of course the teachers will back each other up even if they don\u2019t entirely agree with the way it was handled.

Teachers are less likely to say no to that.", "NTA.  The teacher should be fired.  Denying access to basic necessities like water and bathroom breaks can lead to medical problems.  Beyond that, this is school, not prison.  It's OK to be courteous and INFORM the teacher when you need to leave class.  But the teacher making you ask and then denying????   WTF\n\nNot sure what country you are in, but in some countries if they tried to confine you to a certain room for a specific set time, that would be unlawful arrest.  And the teacher could be facing felony charges for that.\n\nEven in a school environment, you do have rights.  You are expected to attend class, sure.  That's part of the deal.  But not being able to leave briefly when needed?  Foul.\n\nIf I was your dad, I would be after the teacher's creds.  That is, I would fight until that teacher was unemployed and unemployable.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGet some therapy. Leaving class to wander around will just make you fail.", "NTA. I had a teacher who had an unearned grudge against me. \n\nDo not stand for it. Get your parents to complain, schedule meetings with the principal/dean, just don\u2019t let it continue. You\u2019re a kid, and you shouldn\u2019t be having to deal with some old jerk in school.", "NTA - sounds like our science teacher...he made a giant rock as his hallpass so it could be heard being dropped and the student who dropped it could be ridiculed upon returning to class...he finally had to get rid of it because the only way to keep it from getting bacteria in the bathroom was to put it in the sink and a student dropped it while picking it up and broke the sink", "I know it might be difficult but honestly the best thing to do would be to just take a deep breath and talk to this teacher honestly and with no agenda. Just try to be nice, respectful and see what the teacher has to say while also explaining yourself. \n\nTrying to build a good relationship is always a good first step.", "They are responsible for their kids and called to account for them. (You can get roasted if the kid gets into trouble.) BUT, not letting someone go to the restroom in high school is ridiculous. And you're right - just a power trip that they can validate by saying, they are required to account for their students and their behaviors.", "It depends on the school, I think. In the school I teach at we are explicitly told by the administration not to let students go to the bathroom without adult supervision under any circumstances, but that\u2019s because we have a history of students intentionally peeing on floors, punching holes in walls, vaping or even bringing alcohol into the restrooms, and even at least once where two students attempted to have sex in the bathroom. And this on top of all the more mundane \u201ckids who are just trying to get out of class\u201d kind of stuff. I can\u2019t speak for all schools I guess, but in our case, damn right we don\u2019t let our students \u201cleave as needed\u201d, they unfortunately lost that privilege when some of them took advantage of it to do wildly inappropriate things, and in order to prevent those things and attempt to maintain a healthy and safe environment we had to crackdown on it. Might be similar at OPs school for all we know, I don\u2019t especially trust a teenager to present a fair and unbiased account of what happened.", "my friends and I are talking to someone about this next week, so hopefully that helps. I don't really want to get my mom involved because she is a little overprotective and I don't want her overreacting.", "I don't think this teacher will even hear me out at all", "We had one walk right out the back door in the middle of the day. She ducked out because she had a pass to go to the restroom. Her teacher most definitely got reamed for that.  He was in way more trouble than that kid was. Not fair but CYA is just part of the job. \ud83d\ude02", "Maybe in this case a little overreacting is needed. You get failing grades although you do the work and he ignores your anxiety problems. I am a mother, and I would sail into your school like a battleship and solve the problems with this teacher once and for all.", "There's no such thing as \"overreacting\" in this case. You need to tell your mother. You honestly should have done so already. I don't mean that harshly. I'm saying it with great concern. Your mom, she's your best advocate. I promise. My mom went to battle with teachers like that on my behalf, and won, multiple times! Go talk to your mom! Trust her to have your back.\n\nEdited for clarification.", "Good for you! It\u2019s not often that one sees many teenagers asserting their independence. If it works out for you, you\u2019re golden. If it doesn\u2019t, take your lumps and move on. \n\nSome teachers place a high value on class control to the point where they want to control bodily functions. Personally I think it\u2019s silly to treat young adults that way. But I\u2019m not your teacher and I know nothing about your school policies.\n\nHere\u2019s a hint: when you\u2019re discussing this teacher avoid at all costs that this teacher dislikes you. You don\u2019t know that and you cannot prove it. If you do mention it, it will make you seem immature and you won\u2019t be taken seriously. When you\u2019re explaining your issue, talk only about yourself, your anxiety, and your potential of disrupting the class. Talk about the facts as they happened and never voice your opinion. \n\nNTA", "Your mom has more juice in this situation than you do. Use the juice. It works. Principals do not want to wrangle angry parents. Trust me.", "That's a possibility, but you don't know until you try. Just try to be open minded in the conversation and see what happens", "Maybe I'll try that, but I think I'll speak to the counselor first.", "Do NOT try to talk to the teacher on your own. Talking one on one is for people who deserve your trust. This teacher clearly does not. Talk to the counselor, talk to your mom. Make use of witnesses and advocates to keep yourself safe. \n\nI'm proud of you for *respecting your own need* to manage your anxiety.\n\nYou are NTA."]}
