Teachers are less likely to say no to that.", "NTA.  The teacher should be fired.  Denying access to basic necessities like water and bathroom breaks can lead to medical problems.  Beyond that, this is school, not prison.  It's OK to be courteous and INFORM the teacher when you need to leave class.  But the teacher making you ask and then denying????   WTF\n\nNot sure what country you are in, but in some countries if they tried to confine you to a certain room for a specific set time, that would be unlawful arrest.  And the teacher could be facing felony charges for that.\n\nEven in a school environment, you do have rights.  You are expected to attend class, sure.  That's part of the deal.  But not being able to leave briefly when needed?  Foul.\n\nIf I was your dad, I would be after the teacher's creds.

(You can get roasted if the kid gets into trouble.) BUT, not letting someone go to the restroom in high school is ridiculous. And you're right - just a power trip that they can validate by saying, they are required to account for their students and their behaviors.", "It depends on the school, I think. In the school I teach at we are explicitly told by the administration not to let students go to the bathroom without adult supervision under any circumstances, but that\u2019s because we have a history of students intentionally peeing on floors, punching holes in walls, vaping or even bringing alcohol into the restrooms, and even at least once where two students attempted to have sex in the bathroom. And this on top of all the more mundane \u201ckids who are just trying to get out of class\u201d kind of stuff. I can\u2019t speak for all schools I guess, but in our case, damn right we don\u2019t let our students \u201cleave as needed\u201d, they unfortunately lost that privilege when some of them took advantage of it to do wildly inappropriate things, and in order to prevent those things and attempt to maintain a healthy and safe environment we had to crackdown on it. Might be similar at OPs school for all we know, I don\u2019t especially trust a teenager to present a fair and unbiased account of what happened.", "my friends and I are talking to someone about this next week, so hopefully that helps. I don't really want to get my mom involved because she is a little overprotective and I don't want her overreacting.", "I don't think this teacher will even hear me out at all", "We had one walk right out the back door in the middle of the day. She ducked out because she had a pass to go to the restroom. Her teacher most definitely got reamed for that.  He was in way more trouble than that kid was. Not fair but CYA is just part of the job. \ud83d\ude02", "Maybe in this case a little overreacting is needed. You get failing grades although you do the work and he ignores your anxiety problems. I am a mother, and I would sail into your school like a battleship and solve the problems with this teacher once and for all.", "There's no such thing as \"overreacting\" in this case. You need to tell your mother. You honestly should have done so already. I don't mean that harshly. I'm saying it with great concern. Your mom, she's your best advocate. I promise. My mom went to battle with teachers like that on my behalf, and won, multiple times! Go talk to your mom! Trust her to have your back.\n\nEdited for clarification.", "Good for you! It\u2019s not often that one sees many teenagers asserting their independence. If it works out for you, you\u2019re golden. If it doesn\u2019t, take your lumps and move on. \n\nSome teachers place a high value on class control to the point where they want to control bodily functions. Personally I think it\u2019s silly to treat young adults that way. But I\u2019m not your teacher and I know nothing about your school policies.\n\nHere\u2019s a hint: when you\u2019re discussing this teacher avoid at all costs that this teacher dislikes you. You don\u2019t know that and you cannot prove it. If you do mention it, it will make you seem immature and you won\u2019t be taken seriously.

Talking one on one is for people who deserve your trust. This teacher clearly does not. Talk to the counselor, talk to your mom.

I think you need to speak to your parents about this. You should not have walked out of class. Sometimes we need to interrupt our thinking pattern so that we don't spiral downward. You'll learn about that in counselling. It will really help.", "If this is really what's happening where other students can go and you can't then what the others have said of finding a teacher/counselor/adult you trust is the way to go about it.\n\nThat said, I have my doubts it's exactly like this. I teach at a university and while we don't have restrictions on leaving class I can point to at least 4 or 5 cases just this semester where the student is telling me something they think is true that very clearly provably is not.\n\nI'm not saying these students, or you, are lying but something that they (or you) think is true actually is not.\n\nSo because of that, I am giving a mild ESH.", "NTA but talk to your parents.", "ESH. Him for all the reasons that are obvious (denying students a bathroom break is a huge problem). You for lying. You didn't want to go to the bathroom, you wanted to go for a walk and were caught doing that, and the situation spiraled from there. You need to get it on record that being able to take a break is required for your mental health. Can't advocate for yourself because of your anxiety? Then you need to get your parent/guardian to do it.", "NTA tell your parents so they can help you advocate for yourself. Sounds like he\u2019s picking on you anyway so may as well bring it up with the school now", "NTA, i would get your parents involved in this heavily and the past behavior of the teacher by marking you down for having an unknown vendetta against you or your family and asking him to prove the marks he gave you in front of the principal get your graded papers with you for a proof along with the blatant bias he shows against you in class. Ask your friends if they would be willing to talk about it. \n\nInfo: were your parents in this school too when they were kids or did they have an argument with this professor after you started?", "Yes, treatment for anxiety is important. But OP is in a stressful environment and denied coping mechanisms. I am an adult and have accommodations at my university where I can walk out of class whenever I need because my health comes first. All the therapy in the world will not help if OP is not allowed to cope. Stepping out for a bit to get your breathing under control is not going to turn someone into a delinquet.\n\nOP, if you're currently being treated for anxiety, whether by a primary physician or a therapist or any other doctor, see about getting medical accommodations. Your doctor will likely have to fill out some forms for the school, but it will allow you to get the care you need.\n\nAlso, your teacher is on one hell of a power trip. Definitely rope your parents into it. You're probably not the first student he's done this to, and you likely won't be the last unless he is stopped. Take it to the principal. He cannot dock your grade because he feels like it, especially not if you have been performing well.", "I teach secondary school (UK) and can say it's not always as simple as \"Teachers who don't let the kids go to the bathroom are power tripping\".\n\nIf I allowed every single kid who asked to go to the toilet to leave the class. I'd end up with half my students vanishing every lesson. \n\nObviously special considerations have to be made for some students and some situations where they do need to go to the toilet. But letting everyone go whenever they want would make the class vanish sadly, lol.", "That is ridiculous. Honestly if you cannot trust nearly adult people to go to the restroom then just a put a frickin bathroom in the classroom like they do in elementary school. Don't punish the innocent people who just have to pee! (Or poop, or be sick, or use a tampon)", "You were having an actual medical incident and the teacher was more interested in playing power games. You absolutely need to bring your parents in on this. This teacher needs another adult telling him how things are. He'll never listen to you, that's not why assholes like him become teachers. He's there for the power fix. Your mother may seem to overreact, but in this instance you need that on your side. Your teacher is bullying you and sabotaging your education and future. He's earned an overreaction.\n\nNTA.", ">\"I am an adult and have accommodations at my university where I can walk out of class whenever I need because my health comes first.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWIth a doctor's note, that is fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Also, your teacher is on one hell of a power trip. Definitely rope your parents into it. \" .. The teacher is doing THE RIGHT THING. It is THEIR responsibility to make sure student's do not wander the halls but participate in class. IF the teacher allows otherwise, he might risk to lose their job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"He cannot dock your grade because he feels like it, especially not if you have been performing well.\" .. He can, and he should - attendance is a part of the grades. **So UNLESS OP produces a doctor's note, he needs to stay in class, and the teacher needs to enfoce attendance.**"]}
