You said the teacher doesn't let you go to the bathroom, which is bad.

Your teacher sounds like a jerk, but if you're constantly interrupting class to go for walks and wander around, something tells me you might be exaggerating what he does.\n\nIf your anxiety is really so bad you need to disrupt everyone, you need to be taken out of school and put into protective custody.

The teacher is an asshole for not allowing every student to go to the bathroom when they ask.  We shouldn\u2019t be teaching children that they don\u2019t have a right to bodily autonomy.

What does the situation look like?\n\nA student asks a few times to go to the bathroom and is refused. The student abruptly leaves the classroom and when the aide checks on them, they don't find the student in the bathroom, they find them taking a walk. This makes it look look like the student just wanted to take a walk and makes the teach look right in refusing them.\n\nIs the teacher right? No, not at all. Refusing to let a student leave the room is ridiculous and they're a total ass\n\nIs OP right? Trickier. They have legitimate reasons for their behavior, but the teacher and aide don't necessarily know that, so if you look at what they did without that insight it looks like they were disobedient and disruptive. I've never been in a school that was okay with kids roaming the hallways while class was in session. \n\nOP has the option of getting it on record that sometimes they'll need to leave abruptly so they're covered, accepting punishment whenever it happens, or if they leave the room claiming they need to go to the bathroom then that's where they need to go.", "Then deal with the students who vanish?

Teacher wondered why my daughter and several others kicked off. The worst thing about the whole situation is this teacher is female, she should know better. They all walked out and reported the teacher firstly to pastoral but also to the headteacher. My daughter and her friends didn\u2019t get in trouble, thankfully. The school actually called parents to apologise, but as far as we know nothing happened to the teacher. This is a uk high school.", "They aren\u2019t nearly adults.

It\u2019s not as big a deal as you are making it out to be. Plus having designated class bathroom breaks are pretty normal for elementary students (we have kids between the ages of 5-13), so I don\u2019t see why this is such an issue. \n\nAs for \u201cdetention to people who don\u2019t follow the rules\u201d You realize it\u2019s not that simple right, that comment just shows you have very little idea how discipline and class management work. 1 - we usually don\u2019t even know who\u2019s doing it, this isn\u2019t a surveillance state, we don\u2019t have cameras watching everyone all the time, and certainly wouldn\u2019t have any in the restroom, so we only would figure out when we walk in later and someone has peed on the wall or the bathroom reeks of pot or something along those lines. 2 - detention doesn\u2019t even work, the students who get those kinds of consequences simply do not care, they grumble when they get it but it doesn\u2019t stop them from doing whatever they were doing again. Preventative measures where we don\u2019t let the problem begin in the first place are better than reactionary ones where we try to harshly punish students after the damage is done. 3, even if detention did work, it\u2019s not as simple as you think to assign one, especially at our school, there is a significant amount of red tape and a whole process before we can give a student any consequence more serious than a lunch detention, which is basically nothing.", "Less disruptive", "Yep if the school rules say teenagers cant go to the toilet during class and the teacher lets them, the teacher is in trouble and it will be used against them. Im a teacher, I think students should be able to go to the toilet and I try to let them go sneakily but if they get caught its my butt on the line.

This is an inner city free charter school where most of the students come from very poor and often broken homes. Where a significant quantity of the students have been expelled or otherwise unable to fit into multiple normal public schools.\n\nAs in a lot of our students are very extreme on the \u201cbehavior\u201d side of things. They aren\u2019t bad kids but they don\u2019t really know how to act appropriately in a school environment. If we let them leave the classroom without supervision they can and have run around the building slamming doors and walls of other classes, used alcohol and drugs, gotten into fights with one another, or simply just left the room and never came back - which in itself is a massive safety concern when no one knows where the student is. All things that disrupt their learning and often disrupt the learning of other students.\n\nNot all the students are like that of course, but enough are that we cannot afford to play around with this kind of thing, for the safety and education of themselves and all the other students that would otherwise not have a safe and calm learning environment.", "Even if you have that (IMO ridiculous) rule, it's not as if the teacher can prevent a student from walking out of the school?", "You need to get your parents to take you to the doctor to get a prescription and a diagnosis for your heart issues as well as a a therapist for your anxiety.

Also see if a fellow student can help you in that class maybe.", "NTA and get your parents involved.", "NTA", "Can your parents step in? As a teacher, it drives me crazy when students are not allowed to use the restroom, it's a health hazard and we all need breaks throughout the day. NTA.", "You might understand better if you knew the chaos and damage they do to property, to themselves and to others when they do leave supervision.", "As a high school teacher ill say two things. Firstly, you are right.not letting kids go to the toilet is unsafe but also never helps control a class in the long run as you are not liked or respected. But secondly if you are a new teacher or managing behaviours not your thing then it can be really unsettling having kids come and go, especially if they insist on high fiving/disrupting on return right when you are getting some traction. It annoys me when people say the teacher just trying to do job is powertrip or hostage. Its NOT A WEIRD HIGH its trying to maintain control, although sometimes poorly.  Especially when they themselves would hate to stand in front of a class. Ill lastly add i did casual teach at a school where there was no out of class allowed. Emergency toilet only at the office. Thats not the teachers fault.", "Anxiety  can get you to feel  like suffocating.  There is no air in the room.\n\n\nAs such going  out isn't  a choice  but a necessity  in order not to get a full mental  breakdown. \n\nOp doesn't go on walks,op  goes out to reduce the anxiety  and use diffrent methods to calm down  and get back  to normal  as soon as posible. \n\nSo no op is NOT an ah for leaving.", "You never had anxiety  or at least  not really  strong one did you?\n\nIt feels like you can't get  enough air ,you suffocate  and need  to leave the room  to go somewhere else  to avoid a mental breakdown. That's  not  A WAlk but a NECESSITY  like MEDICINE.", "Then maybe they belong at an alternative school? My IBS didn\u2019t stop just because I was in a classroom and me informing my teachers I needed to leave was out of respect, I wasn\u2019t asking. Kids shouldn\u2019t be prevented from leaving just because other kids have behavioral issues.", "Tell your mother before  your anxiety  gets even worse due to the ah teacher.  This is a case where your  mom  is the best person  to tell  you are being  bullied and discriminated against.  Please let her know  asap. Nta", "Then that's less standing for administrative supports. That's too bad because I'd love to see someone advocate for this student.", "Yes. I have anxiety. Millions of people have anxiety. Most of us manage to do so without the excessive coddling of expecting to disrupt everyone's work and put more stress on an overworked employee by just going off to wander around.\n\nStuff like this has an impact. When one person uses their anxiety to justify selfish or reckless behavior (and as others have pointed out, the teacher is responsible for the child and can't have them just wandering around), it makes it harder on the rest of us. People take us less seriously and ignore our needs more.\n\nOP failed to cope and that has consequences.", "The supports generally get outsourced to the local public school, then. (Property taxes pay for public schools, so public schools have to provide the service minutes after a student is deemed to have a need.) BUT, since the OP didn't indicate traveling school relationships - its likely not a part of the deal.", "Op is still  a minor  and  maybe doesn't  know any other  means to cope. Op tried the best possible  to reduce  the anxiety  =get out of the classroom and the teacher  is an AH .", "He specifically does not let them go to the bathroom but the rest of the students can. It was not mentioned that OP frequently leaves class. But if they do, they should make sure they have the accommodations to ensure they can. And never did OP mention that grades were docked for attendence. Usually teachers have a separate 'assignment' that grades attendance.", "The teacher didn't get into trouble because they were following the rules they had been told to follow.\n\nIn my school, we've just started locking all the toilets during lesson time, except for 1 set for students with a medical pass.\n\nIf I let my students out of the classroom to wander around the school unsupervised, I get a bollocking.\n\nI have to deal with kids like your daughter arguing with me all the time and it gets old fast and is massively disruptive to the learning of all the other kids in the room, not to mention makes me feel miserable. It's not my rule. It's a stupid rule, but I get grief if I break it. Go to the toilet at break time, just like I have to!", "That's terrible, and I absolutely think that should have been grounds for firing the teacher if it was corroborated that they said that.\n\nPersonally I always allow female students to use the restroom due to their additional requirements; unless I have reason to believe they are trying to skip lessons.\n\nIt's sad that teachers have to make that judgement call. In a perfect world I would just let anyone who asks to go to the loo to go; but far too many students would abuse that trust to skip classes so sometimes you simply have to say no.", "That's not high school and not exactly relevant then.  I would say the 6-8th grade could possibly b more relevant, they still need to learn boundaries and consequences and if they need to be watched so badly, I agree with just putting a bathroom in the classroom.", "No. I was in a PreK-8 back then. In high school round these parts they just suspend you, (in building or out of building,) for such a thing - unless you are a special needs student. Special needs student staff have slightly different expectations. But, the high schools here have security and many of the elementary schools really don't.", "Tl;dr version: targeting actual wrongdoers and holding them accountable is too hard. Collective punishment of the whole student body is way easier.", "16 is old enough to know how to cope without putting stress on others. Maybe OP has been taught poorly or hasn't had enough life experience to know, but age isn't an excuse.\n\nAnd no, that wasn't the best route possible. The best route possible wouldn't have put so much strain on an overworked employee. Not to mention, the OP admitted to lying about needing to go to the bathroom. Maybe this is habitual.\n\nThe teacher is an AH and so is OP.", "Ah, that makes more sense", "Have you ever has the anxiety  so bad you just didn't  get enough air? I did  and in order to get to think I had to remove the reason and when I finally  could  I started using the coping mechanism. \nAlso at the private  school  with only 8 students  in class there is no 'poor overworked  employee '  , sorry.", "They don't known how to act in a classroom environment and therefore they should have all agency removed, because it would be unreasonable to try actually helping them. #Murica\n\nI know that's not your fault, and it's decisions made by suits and lawyers, but holy smokes is it infuriating. Teachers don't get paid enough to contain all this cognitive dissonance.", "Yes, I have. And I developed coping mechanisms that didn't put a ton of stress upon other people because I understood that my anxiety is my responsibility.\n\nBut the OP never said they felt that, so you're just projecting.\n\nAnd it doesn't matter the circumstances. The teacher is still responsible for the student and their job is adversely affected by the OP deciding to disrupt class and wander around and hiding it with lies."]}
