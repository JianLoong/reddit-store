At first it wasn\u2019t to bad just the kitchen being messy and she always cleaned it up but she\u2019s been having parties recently and the house rn is a mess from her last one last night. One of the conditions for staying home alone was that A\u2019s older sister will drop in from time to time to make sure everything is ok and we aren\u2019t dead so who shows up this morning after the party? A\u2019s big sister and while I was sitting on the couch there was a bong left outside on a table that u could clearly see through the window and when A\u2019s sister asked if it\u2019s mine I said no it\u2019s B\u2019s and she had a laugh with her bf and left. When I went back into my room almost immediately A came in and started asking about it because she heard everything from her room she asked if I took the blame for the bong and I said no. She proceeded to flip out saying that they already know I smoke but don\u2019t know her bf smoked so I should have taken the blame for the bong. (My parents do not like me smoking in the first place and would have probably screamed at me if I had taken the blame). I told her none of this was my fault and that she should have been more careful but she didn\u2019t listen to me and kept saying that I should have taken the blame. \n\nAnd I just want to know I\u2019m I the asshole?
