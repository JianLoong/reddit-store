What does your dad say about this.", "NTA.\n\nThat is crazy for her to not set a specific rent amount, and to demand/require that you pay half of every check to her. It is sad when you see parents taking advantage of their children like this.", "Your mom is not setting you up for success by making such an extravagant purchase and expecting you to foot the bill. NTA", "NTA\n\nIdeally, you need to sit down with your parents and have a discussion about what would be a fair rent/board and what proportion of the utilities you should pay.  You would want to enter this discussion with a clear idea of both what your own place would set you back, and what sort of \"discount\" you expect for the lowered privacy and freedom that comes with living in your parent's house rather than your own place.\n\nYou may well find that $500 a week - room, board and utilities - is a pretty sweet deal.\n\nYou may find that it's not.  Get the facts before you try to have the discussion.\n\nThe problem is that a person whom you could have this discussion with *probably* wouldn't have signed away nearly half your paycheck without asking then guilt tripped you for having a problem with it.\n\nFirst port of call needs to be your father.  How does he feel about the situation?  What was his reaction to your mother signing a car lease/loan that she couldn't afford?  What does he think a fair rent/board/utilities would be?\n\nI mean, your second sentence says you live with your parents, but nowhere in your post is a word about your father.  Is he absent?  Does he even know about any of this?  Does he just agree with whatever your mother says?  Is he just sick of your mother's financial incompetence and happy to make her decisions your problem?\n\nI suspect that any productive discussion with your parents about this will only occur from a position of power.  By which I mean that you have the power to walk away from any deal you think is unfair.  Like, *right fucking then.*\n\nSo get a clear idea of what exactly it's going to cost you to get a place of your own and move there with no assistance from your parents.  Make sure you are in a position to do that.\n\nEnter into a discussion with both your parents about what is a fair rent/board.\n\nDo not be drawn on the subject of the car.  You had no input into the decision to buy that car; you have no responsibility for it.  Same with the bed.  \n\nHave some arguments ready as the discussion becomes more contentious:\n\n1. \"Yes, I know you're my parents, but you are - if we come to an agreement - also going to be my landlords and I your tenant.  I want to clearly establish a fair landlord/tenant relationship *precisely because* I don't want it to negatively affect our parent/child relationship.\"\n2. \"This is a discussion about what is a fair room and board for me to pay while living here.  It is only a discussion about that.  Would you be bringing up \\[your mother's car payments or whatever nonsense they tried to deflect with\\] if you were trying to rent my room to a stranger?\"\n3. \"I really appreciate all the things that you two have done for me as my parents.  However, if you are going to itemise things you did for me as parents and try to put them on a bill now that I'm an adult, I think it's probably best if I just move out before my respect and love for you is permanently damaged.\"\n4. \"I cannot accept that deal and still have respect for myself; you raised me better than that.  Were I to accept your deal, I would end up resenting you and that's the situation I most want to avoid.  It's becoming clear to the only way for us to transition to the adult phase of our parent/child relationship is for me to move out on my own.\"\n\nGood luck.", "Time to move out dude", "Nope she wants you to be her ATM & pay for her new car ?", "NTA but at most you owe market rent for a bedroom, plus utilities and food.

Move out into your own apartment", "Time for your own place.. you would have your privacy and no guilt of..\" what would she do with your room\"?? \n\nFfs that's the lamest excuse.. you are not her ATM. \n\nI can see contributing to the groceries,  and a small amount $200-250  for the month towards electric and water.. but hell no to giving half of your paycheck.. \nThat's ridiculous.", "Just move out, it will solve a lot of issues, and you might gain a new appreciation for your mom and the things that were done for you. Don't be nasty or be mad, just find a place of your own. Good luck", "NTA  \nYour mother is trying to take advantage of you, I don't understand parents who do this to their kids. $2000 a month is crazy. Half that should be more than enough. If she keeps you on a tight budget she's forcing you to stay - and she can keep collecting from you!!", "NTA, making your parent's car payment for them is crazy person behavior. As is buying a car on a lunatic expensive payment because she thinks she can just take the money from her son. \n\nWhat actually needs to happen is a transparent discussion of what the HOUSEHOLD expenses cost and what a reasonable share would be. The car is not a household expense, it's a her expense, and it's her responsibility. Honestly you probably shouldn't even do that, because sticking around is going to encourage and validate this behavior. What you should be doing is moving out.", "Nah, she's taking advantage of you. Your name has to be on the car as co-owner I'd she intends for you to pay off her car.\n\nTime to move out.", "Cheaper to find your own place to live.. she bought the car with the intent of you paying for it.. it\u2019s time you fly the nest and let parents care for themselves.. $800 car payment is stupid.. don\u2019t let her rope you into doing this. You have graduated time to get out and find your own place.", "Speaking as a parent who has 3 adult male children living with me. I live on a budget and encourage my kids to save all their money so they can buy their own homes.

They are grateful for the ability to save. But I would never go out and buy a new car that I\u2019d depend on my kids to pay for. What if they all decide they\u2019ve got a big enough down payment and decide to leave? You are NTA and you are not obligated to pay that much.

It's too awkward when she sees you as a piggy bank.", "NTA You didn't get a job to buy her a car. Pay what you were originally going to or find out what renting a room in your area goes for. If you can get a better deal somewhere else than your mom wants to charge, you can point out that she can either get something or nothing  and you are looking for fairness here. Don't let her guilt trip you on you still living with them. That was their choice as parents to set you up for adulthood. If they did it for a payday then tough for them. BTW what does your dad/ other parent say?", "NTA For 2k you could possibly live on your own. Without the bother of dealing w roommate drama.\n\nDo no do that. It is not your responsibility to pay for your mother's lifestyle choices. If she couldn't've afforded the car without your help, she shouldn't've gotten it.\n\nThere will always be some expense she'll want you to cover.\n\nNEVER pay more than your equal share of the housing expenses.", "Absolutely not!!! Don\u2019t you dare give her that money! This was her choice to live above her means. She cannot depend on the money you contribute. Yes, paying some of the bills could be helpful because you are staying there but it is absurd  to be asking you for you to pay that much! Run! The guilt tripping will never stop. This seems to be a very toxic relationship. You need boundaries.", "This. OP, I would not pay your mom anything, save up a couple paychecks, and move out.", "OP needs too be careful they don't bite the hand that feeds. Mum is being unreasonable asking for car payments but OP not contributing anything as they have been is unreasonable too. It's mum's house and OP could be thrown out of it just as easily as they can move out on their own. They need to sit down and work out something fair.", "Right? My thoughts exactly. Your money is your money. If your mom wants you to contribute tell her you\u2019ll pay for groceries every 2 weeks and put money toward the power and water bill.

And I would move out at the earliest possible convenience.", "I suspect that OP could couch surf with friends if AH mom persists.", "She only bought it when she knew what his salary would be too.

We\u2019re putting most of it into her Roth IRA.", "Yeah especially saying that they want to contribute, but not that much. Plus the saving for their car.
