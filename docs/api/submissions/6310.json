I hate to be this person but yall were married and regardless of her intentions she could have just signed up for loans to go to college and in the end you'd still be on the hook since youre married... I think you learned a HARD lesson about prenups and are mad about it so you're projecting that onto her character... I get being hurt but it's not like you agreeing or disagreeing would have stopped college marriage has it's downsides...Now as for child support I have a sneaky suspicion about what's actually happening... youre too vague... Frankly unless your kids are like 16 and up the court doesn't give a single fuck where they want to go, many judges for many years have sent kids off to parents they didn't want to stay with. I'm getting the feeling youre intentionally leaving out information that makes you look bad to skew everyone into agreeing with you.... It  seems before the arrangements were made for what was fair and good for the kids... Now it seems like maybe between two peoples insanely high hospital bills, a likely single income, and loss of income due to covid the agreements seem to always be in your favor... Seems like mom had to maybe get a not as good lawyer or doesnt have one at all and youre capitalizing off that and utilizing court systems to get revenge for what you feel is her past wrongs to you... \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn short... I think you both suck at parenting or coparenting and need to think about your kids not what you can do legally to hurt each other... And mom should still have to pay child support BUT if her income has truly changed mom shouldn't be left with nothing... you saying too bad so sad about a decrease you could tell the courts youre okay with is not only petty but proves my point yall are horrible at coparenting and compromising", "When her time sharing was cut, did the child support adjustment also reflect her change in income? I mean, you are NTA for not caring about her or her family, but if you know that her child support obligation exceeds her ability to pay, but you are forcing her to pay it anyway just for revenge, then you are being a little bit of an asshole. Because you would be unnecessarily cruel to people that really weren't involved in the issue between you and your Ex. It sounds like karma has done a pretty thorough job of getting her back already.\n\nIf you are not relying on the child support, why not offer to suspend payments and just let the arrearage accrue?

It would be better for all of you if you managed to stay calm and collected in response to her unreasonable demands, if you responded, however insincerly, that you are sorry for her difficulties, but that you need to prioritize your own sons, not their half siblings.

Both Dad and Mom can attend common functions regarding E, sit next to each other and be okay! E also compares our coparenting to her friends that have custody battles and huge fights.

Maybe extend an olive branch, talk to your ex and her spouse and see if you all can pan out a way to coparent, in a healthy manner. That would also be a good time to discuss child support.
