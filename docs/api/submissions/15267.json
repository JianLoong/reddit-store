Carl is part of the group I play DND with. He's been dating Cora for 10 years.\n\nI'll say upfront I don't like Cora, she is stuck up and looks down on us nerds. I have tried to be friendly and get to know her, but she just ignores me and stays glued to her phone or talks only to Carl. Carl says she is shy but really great once you get to know her. To spare his feelings I never told him I don't like Cora, I didn't think my opinion mattered, I see her rarely anyway.\n\nOur group plays once a week, this is the only time Carl does anything on his own, he used to play with another group but quit to have more time with Cora. Last year she started complaining about him going out to play instead of taking her on a date. We even moved the game from Friday to Wednesday (which was hard) because it sounded like she really wanted Fridays to be their special date night. Cora was happy for a few days and then the following week she was complaining again about Carl going out. So the issue is not the day of the week, just that she doesn't want Carl to spend time with friends.\n\nThis is when Carl started looking unhappy and saying things like he didn't see a future for them. I tried to stay neutral because I felt biased by my dislike of Cora, but secretly I was hoping they would break up. Then he stopped talking about ending their relationship and shortly after they were engaged. He didn't complain about Cora wanting him not to go to DND night any more. I thought they had talked it out and come to some agreement.\n\nHowever shortly after, the problems returned. On Xmas she gifted him dance lessons that were on the same day/time as our games. Carl says she means well, and after they're married and start a family he won't have any time for his hobbies.\n\nCarl skipped this week's session due to Cora again. I told Adam (mutual friend) I was done mincing words and next time I see Carl I'm going to tell him I don't think Cora is right in trying to control all his time or his hobbies, and he should think whether he really wants to marry her.\n\nAdam didn't agree, said Cora might be jealous of me and it's a dick move to mess with someone else's relationship. (Adam doesn't think Cora has reason to be jealous, just it's how she might see it.)\n\nTo be clear I don't have any romantic attraction to Carl and I'm already in a relationship with another man. Carl is a great person but not my type. I just can't stand to see my friend so miserable and I want a frank talk with him. I don't necessarily want them to break up but I think the current situation is untenable for Carl. If the genders were swapped and it was a big burly man trying to stop his petite girlfriend from having any outside interests and meeting with her friends, it would be a huge red flag.

If he works a lot, spends a lot of time with his family, barely sees Cora and on top of that goes for weekly hangouts with friends I can see why she is complaining, especially if they are planning kids soon.

My dad never gave up his hobbies with 3 kids. Nor my mom with 2. Many of my friends have kids, some of them area already adults, they didn't give up their hobbies. This is absolutely an unhealthy, controlling relationship. Unfortunately, if you bring it up you'll almost certainly come out the other side looking like an asshole, even though you're just trying to look out for your friend, and D&D party member (which might be bigger for me, because it's a struggle to get a group a lot of the time).", "Sorry YTA and you\u2019re too involved in Carls situation, friend or not.\n\nFirst of all, Carl and Cora have been together for 10 years. I can\u2019t tell if you\u2019ve know him longer or not. \n\nRegardless, you\u2019re convinced she doesn\u2019t like you and looks down on you \u201cnerds.\u201d But she\u2019s probably getting the same vibe from you. Perhaps you tried to be her friend but obviously that didn\u2019t work out. That\u2019s okay, you\u2019re clearly two different people, but you sound like you resent her for that. It\u2019s pretty obvious you wish Carl had gotten with someone \u201cnerdy\u201d who fit in better with his friends and had no issues with his heavily time consuming hobby. Sorry, she doesn\u2019t have to mesh with you or your hobbies, she\u2019s dating him, not you. And you likely don\u2019t mesh with hers either.\n\nAlso, it sounds to me like your group meets up every week in the same day? I\u2019m not too surprised she got tired of her partner being busy every single Friday for hours on end. Frankly being commited to a day *every single week* is like, kind of a lot for most couples to be okay with. Although keeping it on the weekdays makes it a bit less intrusive, the fact is that\u2019s a high expectation. Some couples make it work, maybe the other person enjoys the alone time or schedules something of their own. But it\u2019s a little different if attendance is *mandatory*. I\u2019m vaguely familiar with D&D though, and I assume you can\u2019t really play without him. So as a group, if Carl can\u2019t make every session, then you need to sit down with him and discuss either kicking him out of the group or creating a second campaign that meets maybe once a month. Not go nuclear and hold an intervention under the guise of being concerned for your friend. He\u2019s an adult, if his partner does not appreciate how much his hobby is detracting from the relationship ship, then it\u2019s up to him to decide if he wants to keep the relationship or the hobby.\n\nI\u2019m also not especially surprised if Cora doesn\u2019t like you if your friend confides in you about his relationship issues. Frankly I think it\u2019s downright inappropriate to discuss relationship issues or vent like that to others when the second person in the relationship isn\u2019t even there to defend themselves, but especially to do with those of the same sexual orientation. Whether you have a boyfriend or not, it\u2019s the principle of the matter, and it\u2019s weak willed of him since your clearly going to be on his side and act like an echo chamber.\n\nBtw, I\u2019m a social person that bounces between being girly and being nerdy. And let me tell you, just as I\u2019ve watched popular people be assholes to nerds, nerds also have a huge chip on their shoulder towards the non nerds. Fact is hobbies like DND and Magic have ruined relationships because they can require a lot commitment. Sounds like Carl is realizing this and prioritizing his relationship, you might not like it but it\u2019s his choice and there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with it. \n\nThe biggest fact is that Cora and Carls relationship is 100% between them and you have NO business being involved. Maybe he decides to eventually break up and pursue a relationship with someone whose hobbies align with his own. Maybe he appreciates their differences and is simply a bit sad to cut back on D&D. Either way, not your business.", "He knows the score.  They've been together for a long time and this has been an issue for a long time.  He has to decide whether keeping peace in his relationship is more important than staking out a boundary to protect his friendships.  The friendships probably lose - especially if you push the issue.  YWBTA if you interfere.\n\nThat said...  Folks, if your SO is out there once a week playing D&D or something similar - leave them alone about it.  It's about as harmless as harmless can get.", "This is the most tactful way of voicing your concern, and probably the only one that won't automatically put him on the defensive.", "Yes I am friends with Carl outside the group. We message in private mostly about games and our hobbies. It's nothing I wouldn't show my boyfriend, or that I wouldn't want Cora to see. He confided in me (and another friend \"Barry\") when he thought his relationship was on the rocks, and about some other personal issues with his family. Not sure if that gives me any standing though.", "Thank you, I think this is exactly what I needed to hear. Most people are just saying I'm into Carl therefore I am the asshole, so I was thinking since I'm not into Carl then OF COURSE I'm not the asshole. It doesn't help I have people private messaging me and telling me to blow Carl, people are disgusting, glad I used a throwaway.\n\nAnyway with this comment and a few others I'm seeing how I can be not into Carl AND ALSO the asshole. I am still concerned that I'm not good at being subtle and if I ask Carl how he's doing he'll just say he's fine and we'll go nowhere. But I see your point.", "Thank you for your perspective. Our friend Adam is our DM and he has two young daughters, so I understand how much work goes into juggling all that and work and hobbies. Some friends manage that, others haves decided they want more time with their family and that's okay. I'm just concerned about him saying he won't have time for hobbies or friends at all, and overall seeming unhappy. I see how the nuclear option won't help any.", "I'm fairly certain he spends most of his time with his gf.  They don't live together but she doesn't like her flatmates so she's often at his place in the evenings. He works long hours. He doesn't have friends outside our group (he did but isn't in touch with them any more). He's low contact with his family due to a stained situation. I would say that Carl is closest to me and another friend Barry, due to the fact he confided some things with us. You're the second person who asked, typing this has me concerned that Carl doesn't have friends outside our group.", "I'm sadly aware of how marriage works. I'm 32, aside from Carl I have 3 other friends getting married this summer. I've also been spending less time with friends and more with my SO in the last couple years. I had a bit in my post that I had to cut due to length, where I said I'm concerned because Carl is the only one of my friends who doesn't seem happy about this upcoming wedding. It could be like someone said that he is mostly happy and just wanted to vent about the negative side.\n\nThis is a stupid example but bear with me. A few years ago, when I didn't know Carl very well, I bought a new boardgame and played with him. I told Carl I loved that game and asked him if he'd liked it. He said he had fun as well. I was overjoyed and over the next few months I often suggested we play that game. Much much later, when we got to know each other better, I learned that he doesn't like boardgames of that genre. He confessed he didn't like the game at all but kept playing because the rest of the group liked it. I'm afraid his relationship might be like that boardgame, that he might not say the truth even if he's not happy. He's the kind of person who always wants to present a happy face.", "Honestly I don't know how to go about it. My first got feeling was to be confrontational, which I see now won't help anyone. Right now I'm thinking I should not say anything, except maybe ask how he's doing.", "I agree completely with this. Carl and Cora have been together for 10 years; he knows what she's like, and if he cannot stand up for himself, that's his problem.", "This is great news! If you\u2019re in a long term relationship then becoming controlling over your SO is OK!  No need to bother worrying about your friends if they get cut off from all others! Just stay out of your friends lives and wish them the best in their abusive relationships!  /s\nCarl is already getting cut off.  LOL", "English is not my first language and I was struggling with summing up the situation. I did say in the post that I don't necessarily want him to break up but I'm more concerned that he's unhappy. I got a lot of nasty comments assuming I want Carl for myself, so I wish I lied and said I was a male friend, lol. But I think you are right, in my head I wanted to push him in the direction I think is best of him. He has to make his own choices.", ">you clearly like Carl as more than a friend\n\nOh, come on.", "You are free to believe what you want and downvote this into oblivion. You're wrong. If you can't understand the idea of a man and a woman being platonic friends and not wanting to fuck, I'm sorry for you. I agree with some other commenters who have called me TA for fair reasons but this is laughable.", "You do not think dnd is important but we are his only friend group. Even without the game, I am concerned about him isolating himself.", "I don't think she is abusive in that way. Carl went low contact with his family ages ago due to a conflict with his stepfather. He told me some details, his girlfriend was not involved.", "In general, I would stay out of my friends intimate issues. I'd offer to lend an ear, but wouldn't give my opinion unless specifically & directly asked for. Because I generally never have a full picture of the situation, I am only vented to. You are friends only with Carl & are already biased  against Cora. Can you trust that Carl gave you the full picture of what he is feeling? Or have you been vented to when he needed moral support ?\n\nI agree with u/G1Gestalt that if you decide to talk about it with Carl, then you need to frame it as being concerned about your friendship relation as opposed to blaming Cora.\n\nAfter all, if he stayed with her for 10 years - & yourself you said they don't seem to have an abusive relationship - then there is love between them.", "Stay out of it.", "yeah, you're not the AH for being concerned about a friend's happiness and how someone is treating him. don't listen to that.\n\nhere's the thing though-- if you tell him what you've observed about cora and how you feel about what she's doing, he's probably going to marry her anyway. even if he doesn't get defensive or actually agrees with you on some of it and you have a good conversation, that's going to affect your friendship because he'll always know you hate his wife and disapprove of his choices.\n\nalso, relationships are different to the people in them. there are a lot of things you probably don't know about cora and her schedule and how she treats him when they're alone. maybe he's kind of lamenting the death of his single life before marriage and kids become a thing, but he can only ever vent about that with you guys and he's actually mostly happy about the change. you're only ever getting one side of it.\n\nif he just says he's fine, i think it would be okay to ask how he and cora are doing, if they've set a date for the wedding, or just say since he hasn't been around to play as much, you just wanted to check in and make sure he's okay because he's your friend and you care about him. apparently that's not a thing guys hear a lot. good luck either way!", "Yea having children only exasperates current relationship issues. They will never ever fix a situation.", "Would it be possible to do different type of meetup without playing games and try to include her as well? Maybe different enviroment will improve the situation and he will not end up as isolated. This sounds like he is forced to make a hard choice between you guys and her.", "Write down first what you want to say and practice it with someone else. When you do have a talk, it will help you not 'attack' him. Make it a talk about your feelings and that you feel like your friendship with him is dying (leave his fiance out of it if you can).", "you\u2019re making a lot of assumptions about cora\u2019s behavior based on the narrative of a biased party. there\u2019s no information on what other friends carl has, what other activities he engages in, etc. it\u2019s one friend\u2019s one opinion on one activity.", "You should stay out of it. You may not be privy to the whole situation. Unless he directly asks to talk about it then you are fine.", "I think I took this part of of my post because of length. We do other activities, we often have dinner together or go out. We have tried to invite Cora as well but she rarely comes along. I don't think she has many friends either and I get she feels isolated and wants to spend time with Carl. I remember one dinner at Adam's house where me and Adam's wife were trying to find out her interests and make small talk, and Cora sounded just bored. I'm not great at making small talk but Adam's wife is very chatty and even she was struggling. Only last weekend I asked Carl and Cora if they wanted to have dinner with me and my SO but they said no. Same with an invite to a bbq and pool party, and I know for sure that Cora isn't skipping that to avoid me because I'm not going, I'll be out of town.", "Carl has no other friends. I would say me and another friend Barry are closest to him rn. He had a couple other friend groups he used to hang out with, but he quit most of them during lockdown. I know he spends most evenings and weekends at home with Cora (we text each other). He goes to the gym a couple of mornings a week before work. It would be a different issue if this was just one activity of many, I'm concerned he's isolating himself.", "I\u2019m going to say NAH. You have legitimate concerns for your friend, though I don\u2019t think framing them as \u201cI think you should break up for your fianc\u00e9e\u201d is going to be helpful. You\u2019ve clearly identified patterns of concerning behaviour in his partner, and he expressed serious worries before suddenly preparing to commit himself to her for life. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019d be TA for talking to him. But going in with the agenda of breaking them up is likely to cause a lot of backlash. I\u2019d start a conversation by telling him you have some concerns and that you wanted to talk to him about them to hear his side of things, because as an outsider you know you don\u2019t have the full story. Then go from there.", "I literally lost my best friend to a relationship like this. It started out with us not being able to spend time with him over little things, then she got jealous that he had more friends than she did and she cut him out of our lives piece by piece. She did the same thing with his family (as per his younger brother who I am also friends with) and they have lost all hope of ever getting him back as he is \"a lost cause\". To make matters worse my friend makes quite a good living and supports his gf 100% financially as she has been unable to hold down a job (ever) and given that they are common law and her mother is a divorce lawyer there is a very good chance he would be paying spousal support to her for the rest of his life if he ever did decide to break up with her. I don't know if he is trapped in actuality or if I am just trying to find reasons for my own mental health, but she has cut him off from the entirety of his support network, so it sure seems like he is from where I am sitting.\n\nI wish I had talked to him about what he was getting himself into before it was too late. Don't make my mistake.\n\nNTA", "Welp.\n\nThere's plenty of good advice here. I think people are getting you on a good track.\n\nIf it helps, no matter what you do this is probably going to turn out badly. So, don't worry too much.", "No judgement from me, I think you're in a tough spot, but as a fellow D&D player Cora making you guys reschedule your game night was a huge AH move. Especially since she continued to be upset about it after you switched to Wednesday night. You moved heaven and earth for her and she still wasn't happy.\n\nI agree it sounds like she's being controlling. Maybe she just doesn't like D&D or maybe she wants Carl to be completely focused on her. It's hard to say without more info. I understand your concerns, though.", "YTA.   You do realize you're going to either terribly damage or lose your relationship with Carl if you do this, right?", "YWBTA if you said anything like that to him.  You can try something like \"the group  misses you, and hopes you can come to DND more often\" or you could try arranging something like a group dinner on another night or so, so Carl can spend time with friends.\n\nBut he's an adult and you can't offer the UNSOLICITED advice that he should dump his fiancee.", "Eh... I hear you.  She sounds kinda... insufferable.  It's not healthy not to have your own hobbies.  I've been married tens years, and my husband plays D&D.  I crochet, garden, or read. I can't imagine having him up my butt all the time.  He would eat my snacks.  My father was telling me he and his brother used to be super tight... they did everything together.  Untill Uncle Rick got married.  But, this is not a battle you are going to win. Most you can do is wait it out and let him know ya'll are there for him.", "Honestly, once a week sounds like a lot and I would be annoyed as a spouse too. Hobbies and personal self care are important but you don\u2019t know their relationship and what he may be missing at home by playing hours of DND every week. I\u2019d say YWBTA if you said something. He\u2019s an adult and it\u2019s his relationship.", "100% this. I can't tell you the number of times I didn't like someone's partner, and they ended up married to them, and still are. I still don't think these people are happy with their partners, but I don't think I could have said anything to change it. What I DID do was point out SPECIFIC concerns. \"It seems like BLANK doesn't like you going out with your friends. Is that true, or am I getting the wrong vibe?\" \"Wow. It seems like he got really angry about something so small. Is he normally like that? Are you okay with that?\"\n\nOP, you'll get a lot further opening a door to a potential problem and seeing what they say verses just having an issue with their partner.", "You know of the struggle! :)\nAll jokes aside I understand that priorities change, our group lost two other members in the past few years due to marrying, children, other priorities. But, they all seemed happy and so I am happy for their new chapter in life. With Carl I am concerned he's not happy at all. I kind of wish I'd not mentioned DND at all in post because I get the sense some people are dismissing my concerns because they think oh it's just a silly game. But it's his hobby and a source of joy and we are his friends. I will do my best to set aside my personal opinion and support him, even if it means not saying anything.", "I wish Cora would get along with our group. We have tried to include her and invite her to dinner and other outings but she rarely comes. The few times she is there, she barely talks to us and is glued to Carl. Carl said she is shy. I'm shy myself and I've tried to find mutual ground but I've got nothing. I think she's also lonely and doesn't have many friends. To be clear she is acting the same towards other people in the group, so I don't think she is just freezing me out because she doesn't like me, she's aloof with everyone.", "And then all hell breaks lose if you step on a land mine. But chances are someone is going to step on one.", "Just realized, I never voted in my post up there, NTA. I would try to have a conversation with him about him, and if he's happy with it. He was ready to leave and then suddenly wasn't. Sounds like he's miserable, but doesn't know how to get out.", "Sounds like there's not much love; just that they've both settled for the familiar. \"Baby, you're pretty much the best of my available options. Let's get married.\""]}
