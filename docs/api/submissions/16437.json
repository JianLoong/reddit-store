Heck even people in their 30\u2019s live with their parents. She\u2019s right, apartments are expensive. Houses are expensive. People are going homeless because of the rent crisis going on right now! Why don\u2019t **you** have a job if you want to live together? The onus shouldn\u2019t be on her alone. And it sounds like you\u2019re not listening to what she needs, either.\n\n**You** need to grow up, not her. You sound selfish, immature, and condescending. You\u2019re definitely not ready for a mature relationship.", "YTA my dude. Her trying to help her mom pay off a mortgage by working a full time job is mature af. She's dmart not wanting to waste her money on rent. \n\nAs for not wanting to go to campus, yeah, I can see how online classes are better with a full time job, but maybe you can be a nice guy & try to include her in light social activities to make her feel more comfortable on campus. Good luck!", "I know exactly what she needs. A new boyfriend.\n\nYTA and you should grow up", "YTA\n\n\nShe is not dependent on her parent. She has different views than you. It is as simple as that. You two are very different people. Just because she is living with her mother doesn\u2019t mean she is immature. Living with your parents or getting an online education isn\u2019t ideal for you and the opposite isn\u2019t ideal for your girlfriend. That doesn\u2019t mean either of you is immature. It just means that you two aren\u2019t exactly the most compatible people. \n\n\nYou two seem to be in different phases in your life and it is better to call it off now when you know it\u2019s going to be a problem in the present as well as the future.\n\n\nEdit:typo", "YTA. You accused your girlfriend of being immature because she has social anxiety. Social anxiety is a mental disorder - it has nothing to do with maturity.\n\nFurthermore, your girlfriend is being very mature and responsible about finances. It's incredibly expensive to rent pretty much anywhere, and with you both being in college, it's likely you'll both have pretty limited income. Have you even bothered to look at what kind of options you have and how much it costs? Do you even know if you *can* afford to live together in your own place?\n\nYou seem to be confusing maturity with independence here - she's splitting costs with her mother. She's not independent. However, she's working full time and going to college as well as making smart financial choices -- all signs of significant maturity.\n\nOP, you have reported exactly *zero* signs of your own maturity. You might be able to say living on campus is some kind of independence, but TBH, that depends on how your tuition/room & board is being paid.\n\nAlso, I find it weirdly bizarre how you've made your girlfriend out to be weirdly or super dependent on her mom. Your girlfriend lives at home, sure, but she's also *nineteen*. Most nineteen year olds live with their parents these days.", "It sounds like you think she\u2019s staying home because she\u2019s reliant on her mother, but her reasons may actually be more financial. Maybe her mom can\u2019t make ends meet on her own. Maybe your girlfriend or her her mom needs help with something else that your girlfriend hasn\u2019t shared with you. She\u2019s not immature, she just has different priorities and needs than you.

You have different priorities in life.  That doesn\u2019t make her immature (and it doesn\u2019t make you more mature than her).  You want and value different things.  She\u2019s happy with her living situation and making choices that support it, which\u2026is a mature thing to do.  Living according to your own priorities rather than the societally expected progression takes maturity and security and faith in yourself.  It\u2019s easier to give in to social expectations, peer pressure, and FOMO.\n\nIt sounds like April may need therapy to help with her anxiety, but that\u2019s not being immature, that\u2019s having a mental illness.  And that\u2019s assuming that you\u2019re right in saying that the reason she\u2019s doing college online is her anxiety; it sounds like that might be an assumption on your part.  I can\u2019t tell.", "YTA \\~ she should never had dated you", "'You're not giving me what I want, so you're immature!' says the toddler. Go on, stamp your foot.\n\nYTA.

She is 100% in the right in terms of economics and maturity to prefer a house & mortgage over rent. \n\nINFO: who is paying your tuition?

She is also right it's a terrible time to rent if you can live with your parent while going to college do it.", "YTA.\n\nBeing dependent on her parent would mean she would be living off of her mothers money and it seems like she fends for herself. Getting a place in this economy would also not be too terribly smart.\n\nYou are the one who needs to grow up. Honestly, I don't get how you think you're grown thinking you need to move in with someone just to prove that you're in a relationship. Are you planning on marrying her ? She's being smart about not moving in with you, financially and personally.\n\nYou are essentially having a full grown tantrum bc she doesn't want to move in with you.

A relationship is about two people both bringing out the best in each other and buildings a happy life together. You\u2019re calling her names and completely disregarding her wants and needs because your wants come first. Or at least that\u2019s how it sounds. \nHonestly you\u2019ve got a lot of growing up and maturing to do so maybe you should be single for a few years. The human brain isn\u2019t fully developed until you\u2019re about 25 so maybe give yourself some time.", "Why do you think that haranguing and insulting her is going to make her want to live with you? You sound like a terrible boyfriend, you have no empathy for her, no interest in her responsibilities. YTA", "YTA you insulted her. So you have different views and different goals, that's no reason to belittle her by telling her to \"grow up\" when she *is* being grown up. You say she's introverted and suffers from social anxiety, but you don't give any evidence of such claims. Plenty of people do classes online. It's a time *and* money saving choice, especially if she's working full time and lives in the suburbs where there's a decent commute to campus.\n\nYou're trying to rush things. That's pretty immature. Maybe she's not the one that needs to grow up.", "YTA I can\u2019t believe you even had to ask???", "YTA\u2026 from what this says she\u2019s staying at home to contribute financially so they can keep their house. How is that her being dependent on her mom?\n\nIn person school isn\u2019t for everyone. Anxiety effects different people in different ways. If your not willing to support your girlfriends health, maybe she should rethink this relationship. Don\u2019t be surprised when she decides she can find someone who supports her choices.", "YTA - if you dislike her as much as you sound like you dislike her, why are you even with her? I don't even know that I believe she has social anxiety, tbh, I think you just like to talk down about her. But, if she does truly have social anxiety, telling her to grow up is in no way helpful. So what if she wants to stay with her mom a little longer? She's only 19. She doesn't need you pushing her to live her life in a way she doesn't want to live it. Is she really introverted? Or does she just want to go to college online? Even if she is, so what? Introverted just means you get tired being around people for an extended period and prefer to be alone. Nothing she's doing sounds terrible, in fact, helping her mother pay off the house sounds smarter than moving in with you. I think you're what she's not comfortable with, probably because you're so pushy and derogatory, tbh", "YTA and she\u2019s 1000% right in saying you\u2019re the one who needs to grow up, and I might add, respect her fucking right to live her life as she wishes, regardless of how inconvenient it is to your sex life since this is obviously your motivation.", "YTA. I hope she dumps your ass.", "YTA\n\nYou whine about wanting her to grow up... \n\nYou two are world's apart in maturity levels but newsflash, I ain't talking about you being the mature one.", "YTA. I can see how you\u2019re frustrated because you want different things, but she\u2019s probably right you\u2019re too young to live together. It might be best to move on from her because this doesn\u2019t seem like an issue that will just solve itself", "Yta, this sounds like a *you* problem. You're still pretty young, too. Perhaps it's time to do some growing up of  your own.", "YTA", "So your wants/needs are more important than hers? You're demanding she leaves her comfort zone because you want to live together?

Why don\u2019t you get a job and a apartment yourself for you both to live in? Why is that her responsibility? Aren\u2019t you the immature one not working as she would have to support you? After all she\u2019s doing both studying and working full time where as you\u2019re just a student. She\u2019s got way more experience being an adult than you, she\u2019s working her ass off to get by and set herself up for the future by paying for the house. She\u2019s not dependent on her mother, she\u2019s investing in the house and paying the damn bills. What have you done recently? How much money do you bring in? I hope she reads this. Yta", "YTA.

It is entirely reasonable for her to still love with her parents.  And it\u2019s inappropriate for you pressure her into a relationship step she has told you she is not ready for.", "YTA and you show your immaturity by thinking being an adult is a linear progression of events (face to face college, leaving home, shacking up with a partner, cutting parental strings etc.) There are multiple reasons why the things she does may play out to be the smarter options in life.\n\nYou and your girlfriend are growing apart. Maybe this relationship is at an end. And you know what? That's OK. It happens often, especially at your ages. If it's not already too late, you two need to sit down and have a discussion about what you both want and what a future together might look like.\n\nWhat's not OK is belittling, insulting and pressuring your girlfriend for not reaching milestones you believe equate to maturity.", "YTA. She is far more put together and sensible then you are.", "YTA, she is 19, not 25. It's normal to still live with (one of) your parents at that age, especially when you are still studying. Being an adult is making wise financial choices, like saving money and not moving out while renting is very expensive.

A great deal for him!", "It\u2019s actually roughly between 25-30 and if there is trauma in childhood it can continue developing into your 40\u2019s", "19 is so young to move in with a romantic partner.  I never would have considered it at that age.  It is super good for people to live alone or with roommates and experience living in the world alone - which is what he should be doing right now, instead of relying on a romantic partner.  She clearly has an adult plan for her life and knows her own boundaries.    Living together is a huge step and is difficult on a relationship- you should never pressure someone into that.", "Mature disagreement involves accepting the other person\u2019s viewpoint may differ from yours without insulting or guilt tripping. Your words act like something is wrong with your gf for disagreeing with you. That is where you are the asshole and the immature one.", "You asked if you were the asshole, we answered. You are, and that's what we're treating you like.", "You asked if you're the asshole, bro;  either you always understood that you might be facing the music, or you honestly thought that you were blameless and this entire forum was going to validate your shitty judgement.\n\nIf the first: take your own advice and grow up. Own the mistake, because it won't be your last, and try to do better next time.\n\nIf the second: leave, because you're not going to get the answer you want.", "This is literally a direct answer to questions you asked", "Telling someone to \u201cgrow up\u201d when they don\u2019t move in with you isn\u2019t a disagreement. Don\u2019t act like a monster and people won\u2019t call you one.", "OP thinks mom is going to a retirement home because she\u2019s just so ancient at 65 /s. This child has no idea what the world is like and just wants to pressure his girlfriend into paying out the ass for some overpriced city apartment when she\u2019s repeatedly said she\u2019s not ready to live together at two years and doesn\u2019t want to or likely can\u2019t swing the rent for something like that.", "Lol, I'm pretty sure it would be the other way around.", "Rely on you for what you're unemployed with no mention of how you were gonna pay your share of rent on this \"grown up\" apartment.", "That makes sense!", "You\u2019re the one who needs to grow up if you think giving up a mostly/fully paid off house for a rented apartment is a wise financial investment. Your immaturity and lack of real life experience is shining through. Do you work full time? If not, how do you even intend to split things 50/50 if you were to live together?", "Her mom is 65. If she doesn\u2019t have any medical issues, that\u2019s entirely too young for living in a retirement home in this day and age.", "Oh boy. \u201cAdvanced age\u201d?", "You suuuuuck dude.

Here's hoping you grow out of it.", "I suppose it\u2019s up to the individual what they want.
