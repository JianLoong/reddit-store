Heck even people in their 30\u2019s live with their parents. She\u2019s right, apartments are expensive. Houses are expensive. People are going homeless because of the rent crisis going on right now! Why don\u2019t **you** have a job if you want to live together? The onus shouldn\u2019t be on her alone. And it sounds like you\u2019re not listening to what she needs, either.\n\n**You** need to grow up, not her. You sound selfish, immature, and condescending. You\u2019re definitely not ready for a mature relationship.", "YTA my dude. Her trying to help her mom pay off a mortgage by working a full time job is mature af. She's dmart not wanting to waste her money on rent. \n\nAs for not wanting to go to campus, yeah, I can see how online classes are better with a full time job, but maybe you can be a nice guy & try to include her in light social activities to make her feel more comfortable on campus. Good luck!", "I know exactly what she needs. A new boyfriend.\n\nYTA and you should grow up", "YTA\n\n\nShe is not dependent on her parent. She has different views than you. It is as simple as that. You two are very different people. Just because she is living with her mother doesn\u2019t mean she is immature. Living with your parents or getting an online education isn\u2019t ideal for you and the opposite isn\u2019t ideal for your girlfriend. That doesn\u2019t mean either of you is immature. It just means that you two aren\u2019t exactly the most compatible people. \n\n\nYou two seem to be in different phases in your life and it is better to call it off now when you know it\u2019s going to be a problem in the present as well as the future.\n\n\nEdit:typo", "YTA. You accused your girlfriend of being immature because she has social anxiety. Social anxiety is a mental disorder - it has nothing to do with maturity.\n\nFurthermore, your girlfriend is being very mature and responsible about finances. It's incredibly expensive to rent pretty much anywhere, and with you both being in college, it's likely you'll both have pretty limited income. Have you even bothered to look at what kind of options you have and how much it costs? Do you even know if you *can* afford to live together in your own place?\n\nYou seem to be confusing maturity with independence here - she's splitting costs with her mother. She's not independent. However, she's working full time and going to college as well as making smart financial choices -- all signs of significant maturity.\n\nOP, you have reported exactly *zero* signs of your own maturity. You might be able to say living on campus is some kind of independence, but TBH, that depends on how your tuition/room & board is being paid.\n\nAlso, I find it weirdly bizarre how you've made your girlfriend out to be weirdly or super dependent on her mom. Your girlfriend lives at home, sure, but she's also *nineteen*. Most nineteen year olds live with their parents these days.", "It sounds like you think she\u2019s staying home because she\u2019s reliant on her mother, but her reasons may actually be more financial. Maybe her mom can\u2019t make ends meet on her own. Maybe your girlfriend or her her mom needs help with something else that your girlfriend hasn\u2019t shared with you. She\u2019s not immature, she just has different priorities and needs than you.

You have different priorities in life.  That doesn\u2019t make her immature (and it doesn\u2019t make you more mature than her).  You want and value different things.  She\u2019s happy with her living situation and making choices that support it, which\u2026is a mature thing to do.  Living according to your own priorities rather than the societally expected progression takes maturity and security and faith in yourself.  It\u2019s easier to give in to social expectations, peer pressure, and FOMO.\n\nIt sounds like April may need therapy to help with her anxiety, but that\u2019s not being immature, that\u2019s having a mental illness.  And that\u2019s assuming that you\u2019re right in saying that the reason she\u2019s doing college online is her anxiety; it sounds like that might be an assumption on your part.  I can\u2019t tell.", "YTA \\~ she should never had dated you", "'You're not giving me what I want, so you're immature!' says the toddler. Go on, stamp your foot.\n\nYTA.

She is 100% in the right in terms of economics and maturity to prefer a house & mortgage over rent. \n\nINFO: who is paying your tuition?

She is also right it's a terrible time to rent if you can live with your parent while going to college do it.", "YTA.\n\nBeing dependent on her parent would mean she would be living off of her mothers money and it seems like she fends for herself. Getting a place in this economy would also not be too terribly smart.\n\nYou are the one who needs to grow up. Honestly, I don't get how you think you're grown thinking you need to move in with someone just to prove that you're in a relationship. Are you planning on marrying her ? She's being smart about not moving in with you, financially and personally.\n\nYou are essentially having a full grown tantrum bc she doesn't want to move in with you.

A relationship is about two people both bringing out the best in each other and buildings a happy life together. You\u2019re calling her names and completely disregarding her wants and needs because your wants come first. Or at least that\u2019s how it sounds. \nHonestly you\u2019ve got a lot of growing up and maturing to do so maybe you should be single for a few years. The human brain isn\u2019t fully developed until you\u2019re about 25 so maybe give yourself some time.", "Why do you think that haranguing and insulting her is going to make her want to live with you? You sound like a terrible boyfriend, you have no empathy for her, no interest in her responsibilities. YTA", "YTA you insulted her. So you have different views and different goals, that's no reason to belittle her by telling her to \"grow up\" when she *is* being grown up. You say she's introverted and suffers from social anxiety, but you don't give any evidence of such claims. Plenty of people do classes online. It's a time *and* money saving choice, especially if she's working full time and lives in the suburbs where there's a decent commute to campus.\n\nYou're trying to rush things. That's pretty immature. Maybe she's not the one that needs to grow up.", "YTA I can\u2019t believe you even had to ask???", "YTA\u2026 from what this says she\u2019s staying at home to contribute financially so they can keep their house. How is that her being dependent on her mom?\n\nIn person school isn\u2019t for everyone. Anxiety effects different people in different ways. If your not willing to support your girlfriends health, maybe she should rethink this relationship. Don\u2019t be surprised when she decides she can find someone who supports her choices.", "YTA - if you dislike her as much as you sound like you dislike her, why are you even with her? I don't even know that I believe she has social anxiety, tbh, I think you just like to talk down about her. But, if she does truly have social anxiety, telling her to grow up is in no way helpful. So what if she wants to stay with her mom a little longer? She's only 19. She doesn't need you pushing her to live her life in a way she doesn't want to live it. Is she really introverted? Or does she just want to go to college online? Even if she is, so what? Introverted just means you get tired being around people for an extended period and prefer to be alone. Nothing she's doing sounds terrible, in fact, helping her mother pay off the house sounds smarter than moving in with you. I think you're what she's not comfortable with, probably because you're so pushy and derogatory, tbh", "YTA and she\u2019s 1000% right in saying you\u2019re the one who needs to grow up, and I might add, respect her fucking right to live her life as she wishes, regardless of how inconvenient it is to your sex life since this is obviously your motivation.", "YTA. I hope she dumps your ass.", "YTA\n\nYou whine about wanting her to grow up... \n\nYou two are world's apart in maturity levels but newsflash, I ain't talking about you being the mature one.", "YTA. I can see how you\u2019re frustrated because you want different things, but she\u2019s probably right you\u2019re too young to live together. It might be best to move on from her because this doesn\u2019t seem like an issue that will just solve itself", "Yta, this sounds like a *you* problem. You're still pretty young, too. Perhaps it's time to do some growing up of  your own.", "YTA", "So your wants/needs are more important than hers? You're demanding she leaves her comfort zone because you want to live together?

Why don\u2019t you get a job and a apartment yourself for you both to live in? Why is that her responsibility? Aren\u2019t you the immature one not working as she would have to support you? After all she\u2019s doing both studying and working full time where as you\u2019re just a student. She\u2019s got way more experience being an adult than you, she\u2019s working her ass off to get by and set herself up for the future by paying for the house. She\u2019s not dependent on her mother, she\u2019s investing in the house and paying the damn bills. What have you done recently? How much money do you bring in? I hope she reads this. Yta", "YTA.

It is entirely reasonable for her to still love with her parents.  And it\u2019s inappropriate for you pressure her into a relationship step she has told you she is not ready for.", "YTA and you show your immaturity by thinking being an adult is a linear progression of events (face to face college, leaving home, shacking up with a partner, cutting parental strings etc.) There are multiple reasons why the things she does may play out to be the smarter options in life.\n\nYou and your girlfriend are growing apart. Maybe this relationship is at an end. And you know what? That's OK. It happens often, especially at your ages. If it's not already too late, you two need to sit down and have a discussion about what you both want and what a future together might look like.\n\nWhat's not OK is belittling, insulting and pressuring your girlfriend for not reaching milestones you believe equate to maturity.", "YTA. She is far more put together and sensible then you are.", "YTA, she is 19, not 25. It's normal to still live with (one of) your parents at that age, especially when you are still studying. Being an adult is making wise financial choices, like saving money and not moving out while renting is very expensive.

You think it's immature to do online college and live with your parents at 19. That's a far more sensible plan so not immature.\n4. She feels the current financial situation is not the best time to be making plans for living with someone. She's also not wrong on that.\n5.

If you want a girlfriend that will move in with you go find her. But don\u2019t you dare discourage April.  \nLiving on campus is not the be-all-end-all mark of maturation you think it is.  Staying home and helping a parent keep the house is mature. Having a full time job WFH AND going to school online full time at NINETEEN is impressive and mature.

She is working *and* going to school and helping out with the household bills! I wasn't doing that at 19! You need to evaluate the situation as a whole.

It\u2019s funny how he\u2019s looking down on her for not having her own place yet, whilst he\u2019s living on campus and likely having everything provided for him by the school.", "The random, Reddit assigned name of \"Dependent Ranger\" just fits OP so well", "It wasn\u2019t always that way, but the practice of moving out of your family home really started after WWII. Many soldiers who severed were able to hit to college under the GI bill when they probably never had the chance to before. And that led to better job opportunities and more money. That, the baby boom, and the creation of the suburb with affordable housing led to the advertising of owning your own home and starting your own family units.", "I\u2019ve been seeing that mentioned around here and I think that\u2019s way better. Like why leave if you\u2019re not ready and prepared to do so??? Just to fit in? And why do parents not like their kids and want them gone as fast as possible? It\u2019s wild.", "100%. I\u2019m 27 and still happily live with my mom, and my cousins on my Greek side are in their 40\u2019s and live with their parents. Family is family. Hyperindividualism is a silly American concept that my family never understood as immigrants. Hell, my grandparents on the other side of my family were both 25 and living with my grandfather\u2019s parents in 1940.", "It really is a thing in the States.\n\nMy husband and I are judged immediately when we say we live with his mother & grandmother. His mom had him late in life (40s) and she's on disability, so is Grandma. We moved in with them after we got married to help them out with things around the house, everything from laundry to cooking to cleaning, lawn maintenance etc.\n\nI work full time and my husband takes care of them full time. We also pay them rent and help with groceries, bills etc. because taking care of family means a lot to both of us & they badly need the help.\n\nOnce it's apparent we're living there to take care of aging family the tune of those judging usually changes but like... why does it have to be that way for you to not hate the idea of someone being in the same dwelling as their immediate family and being happy? Lol why does it bother people so much? I don't understand it. I had a shitty home life growing up and wish I was close enough with my family to be like OP's gf & mom.", "It all makes sense now. I'm in my '50s and still enjoy watching cartoons!  \n\nI'm not ashamed, I'm proud. If we were together now, we could all join hands, and sing the title sequence from Phineas and Ferb!", "God damnit. That last part got me bad", "I'm going by the same information that everyone else has here, and that's the way it was sounding.", "And that's fine, but at some point, you have to stand on your own two feet. Not to mention, if you're going to enter into a relationship, either side needs to know they can count on the other. But whichever.", "Is this dude for real? Does she have health problems or does he think 64-65 is one foot in the proverbial grave? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "tbf, there's nothing childish about cartoons other than a societal opinion.", "I\u2019m in my 30s, my parents are in their late 50s, and we all love Phineas and Ferb! Hooray for summer vacation \ud83d\ude09", "Can I substitute the Bunny of Seville?", "\"Aren't you a bit *old* to be watching Phineas and Ferb?\"\n\nu/KPinCVG: Yes. Yes I am.", "CS Lewis -\n\nWhen I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.", "No, that sounds like an issue with reading comprehension on your part.", "We don't have a lot of information, though. We have OP claiming she's a big mommy's girl but no actual examples of how she is one, just OP saying she \"never wants to let her go,\" which could mean anything. Could it mean she's too dependent on her mother? Sure, but honestly, it could also mean that OP doesn't like them having a close relationship. \n\nI think we can say OP is somewhat of an unreliable narrator, given his attitude toward this particular issue. He, at 20, is pushing his 19 year old girlfriend into moving in with him soon and clearly doesn't view her reasons for doing so as reasonable. But I'm sure we can all recognize that two college students still in their very early 20s would struggle to find an apartment within their budget, so the gf presents a rational reason for not being ready to move out of her house with her mom.", "She\u2019s 19. Working full time. And going to school. It sounds like she\u2019s actually incredibly capable of standing on her own two feet. And with all of that under her belt already, heck I\u2019d even count on her! She\u2019s still young and so is OP. 19 is very very young to consider moving in with a partner. And she\u2019s right, rates are high these days! He dismisses her real anxiety about leaving the house and taking online classes as just her \u201cstaying with mommy\u201d but she seems to be making the best that she can out of the cards she\u2019s been dealt. It\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s close with her mom considering her dad wasn\u2019t around. I think OP is fine to be bummed about her not wanting to live together. But reducing how she\u2019s managing her life to being just a \u201cmommys girl\u201d is a little cruel", "Honestly, it just seems like HES the one who\u2019s immature. I get it, I was also a privileged kid whose parents paid for them to live on campus, and at 19 it seems like getting out of your parents house is the height of independence, and it was important to me then. Saving on rent and enjoying spending time with your family sounds totally reasonable to me now, in my 30s.\n\nEdit to add: and I\u2019ll tell you right now at 19 I lived on my own and wasn\u2019t close to as responsible as the girlfriend sounds.", "Whoa are you kidding me \ud83d\ude24 In this climate having a paid off house is an amazing, rare thing. Especially if that's something she anticipates at 19 years old. Your girlfriend is remarkably mature and intelligent. You should listen to her because it's you who lacks maturity. \n\nAnd for the record moving in together this early on in your life is probably a bad move. Especially for her, since you seem extremely ignorant about how the world works. & that's okay, because you are 20. But definitely understand that you are immature.", "Wow, referring to a solid house in this economy as suburban and boring because it's not near enough bars? Now *that's* mature! /s", "You're calling your girlfriend immature for helping and having a shared goal with her mom with regards to housing, yet dismiss her home as \"boring\". See the hypocrisy here? Your gf has more responsible concerns then her house not being fun enough.", "Man imagine wasting mass amounts of money on apartment living when you can possibly live in a paid off house because said house is too \"suburban and boring.\"\n\nSounds like you're the one with some growing up to do.", ">I don\u2019t like her house. It\u2019s too suburban and boring.\n\nAre you for for real? You turn your nose up at a perfectly good house because you think it is *boring*? In this economy? YTA and immature as hell", "This is not said enough", "I am a grown adult who named her cats Phineas and Ferb.", "But do you also love Spyro? Because Spyro is cool asf", "Durrhurr...durrhurr...actually, it sounds like you women are doing the usual and siding with the other woman, no matter what. But since I'm no kissass, I still say op is NTA. Fortunately, I also don't base my personal value on a little number in the corner, so downvote away.", "Living in a house as opposed to an apartment means more responsibility, which we know OP is not mature enough to handle as he expects GF to move in and take care of everything.", "Retirement home. ROFL.\n\nMaybe adult communities, but not nearly of age for a retirement home. Good grief.", "You rock! \ud83d\udc95", "Is this one of those \u201cusername checks out moments\u201d?

Hell, a lot of countries are trying to push it above that because people are living longer and healthier. 65 is not ancient, you're just a baby", "Be honest are you pushing her to live with you so she could pay most of the bills cook and clean for you? Be honest WHY you want to live together. to me, it doesn\u2019t sound like you give a flying fuck about this girl besides just wanting an apartment in the city and not affording it or being approved for it on your own. Yes I\u2019d rather live with my mother than a freeloading probably gross 20 year old who is judgmental and doesn\u2019t like my mother. You\u2019re dead weight. Hope she drops you soon", "Advanced age of 65\u2026 my mom is 63 and still working a pretty physically demanding job, my dad is 62 and retired and goes golfing once or twice a week. They still live and maintain the good sized home we grew up in. No retirement homes in their near futures.\n\nMy grandma moved into one a couple of years ago? At 86.", "\u201cOnly\u201d two years but you think your gf is u reasonable for not wanting to uproot her life and finances to live with you already. Which is it?", "My grandma lived in her own until she was 94. 65 is not ancient!", "And you have the audacity to call your gf immature? \ud83d\ude05", "How. The fuck. Do you not. Know this shit. AFTER TWO YEARS TOGETHER? YTA for that in addition to the issue at hand.", "JFC.", "PERFECT RESPONSE HONESTLY", "Hold my calls. Gotta go box up my 94 year old great aunt and take her to the nursing home.", "dude literally, he sounds exactly like the type of un-chill redditor who would start cussing at a stranger unprovoked then try to pretend he was totally chill", "Only two years and they're only 19 and 20. Moving in together when you've been together for two years in your late 20s or early 30s would be totally normal. Moving in together when you're that young and still in school isn't something that should be expected.", "It's more likely OP is a baffon and assuming 65 is \"ancient\" - you should read his other comments and you'd come to this conclusion too."]}
