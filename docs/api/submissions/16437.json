Heck even people in their 30\u2019s live with their parents. She\u2019s right, apartments are expensive. Houses are expensive. People are going homeless because of the rent crisis going on right now! Why don\u2019t **you** have a job if you want to live together? The onus shouldn\u2019t be on her alone. And it sounds like you\u2019re not listening to what she needs, either.\n\n**You** need to grow up, not her. You sound selfish, immature, and condescending. You\u2019re definitely not ready for a mature relationship.", "YTA my dude. Her trying to help her mom pay off a mortgage by working a full time job is mature af. She's dmart not wanting to waste her money on rent. \n\nAs for not wanting to go to campus, yeah, I can see how online classes are better with a full time job, but maybe you can be a nice guy & try to include her in light social activities to make her feel more comfortable on campus. Good luck!", "I know exactly what she needs. A new boyfriend.\n\nYTA and you should grow up", "YTA\n\n\nShe is not dependent on her parent. She has different views than you. It is as simple as that. You two are very different people. Just because she is living with her mother doesn\u2019t mean she is immature. Living with your parents or getting an online education isn\u2019t ideal for you and the opposite isn\u2019t ideal for your girlfriend. That doesn\u2019t mean either of you is immature. It just means that you two aren\u2019t exactly the most compatible people. \n\n\nYou two seem to be in different phases in your life and it is better to call it off now when you know it\u2019s going to be a problem in the present as well as the future.\n\n\nEdit:typo", "YTA. You accused your girlfriend of being immature because she has social anxiety. Social anxiety is a mental disorder - it has nothing to do with maturity.\n\nFurthermore, your girlfriend is being very mature and responsible about finances. It's incredibly expensive to rent pretty much anywhere, and with you both being in college, it's likely you'll both have pretty limited income. Have you even bothered to look at what kind of options you have and how much it costs? Do you even know if you *can* afford to live together in your own place?\n\nYou seem to be confusing maturity with independence here - she's splitting costs with her mother. She's not independent. However, she's working full time and going to college as well as making smart financial choices -- all signs of significant maturity.\n\nOP, you have reported exactly *zero* signs of your own maturity. You might be able to say living on campus is some kind of independence, but TBH, that depends on how your tuition/room & board is being paid.\n\nAlso, I find it weirdly bizarre how you've made your girlfriend out to be weirdly or super dependent on her mom. Your girlfriend lives at home, sure, but she's also *nineteen*. Most nineteen year olds live with their parents these days.", "It sounds like you think she\u2019s staying home because she\u2019s reliant on her mother, but her reasons may actually be more financial. Maybe her mom can\u2019t make ends meet on her own. Maybe your girlfriend or her her mom needs help with something else that your girlfriend hasn\u2019t shared with you. She\u2019s not immature, she just has different priorities and needs than you.

You have different priorities in life.  That doesn\u2019t make her immature (and it doesn\u2019t make you more mature than her).  You want and value different things.  She\u2019s happy with her living situation and making choices that support it, which\u2026is a mature thing to do.  Living according to your own priorities rather than the societally expected progression takes maturity and security and faith in yourself.  It\u2019s easier to give in to social expectations, peer pressure, and FOMO.\n\nIt sounds like April may need therapy to help with her anxiety, but that\u2019s not being immature, that\u2019s having a mental illness.  And that\u2019s assuming that you\u2019re right in saying that the reason she\u2019s doing college online is her anxiety; it sounds like that might be an assumption on your part.  I can\u2019t tell.", "YTA \\~ she should never had dated you", "'You're not giving me what I want, so you're immature!' says the toddler. Go on, stamp your foot.\n\nYTA.

She is 100% in the right in terms of economics and maturity to prefer a house & mortgage over rent. \n\nINFO: who is paying your tuition?

She is also right it's a terrible time to rent if you can live with your parent while going to college do it.", "YTA.\n\nBeing dependent on her parent would mean she would be living off of her mothers money and it seems like she fends for herself. Getting a place in this economy would also not be too terribly smart.\n\nYou are the one who needs to grow up. Honestly, I don't get how you think you're grown thinking you need to move in with someone just to prove that you're in a relationship. Are you planning on marrying her ? She's being smart about not moving in with you, financially and personally.\n\nYou are essentially having a full grown tantrum bc she doesn't want to move in with you.

A relationship is about two people both bringing out the best in each other and buildings a happy life together. You\u2019re calling her names and completely disregarding her wants and needs because your wants come first. Or at least that\u2019s how it sounds. \nHonestly you\u2019ve got a lot of growing up and maturing to do so maybe you should be single for a few years. The human brain isn\u2019t fully developed until you\u2019re about 25 so maybe give yourself some time.", "Why do you think that haranguing and insulting her is going to make her want to live with you? You sound like a terrible boyfriend, you have no empathy for her, no interest in her responsibilities. YTA", "YTA you insulted her. So you have different views and different goals, that's no reason to belittle her by telling her to \"grow up\" when she *is* being grown up. You say she's introverted and suffers from social anxiety, but you don't give any evidence of such claims. Plenty of people do classes online. It's a time *and* money saving choice, especially if she's working full time and lives in the suburbs where there's a decent commute to campus.\n\nYou're trying to rush things. That's pretty immature. Maybe she's not the one that needs to grow up.", "YTA I can\u2019t believe you even had to ask???", "YTA\u2026 from what this says she\u2019s staying at home to contribute financially so they can keep their house. How is that her being dependent on her mom?\n\nIn person school isn\u2019t for everyone. Anxiety effects different people in different ways. If your not willing to support your girlfriends health, maybe she should rethink this relationship. Don\u2019t be surprised when she decides she can find someone who supports her choices.", "YTA - if you dislike her as much as you sound like you dislike her, why are you even with her? I don't even know that I believe she has social anxiety, tbh, I think you just like to talk down about her. But, if she does truly have social anxiety, telling her to grow up is in no way helpful. So what if she wants to stay with her mom a little longer? She's only 19. She doesn't need you pushing her to live her life in a way she doesn't want to live it. Is she really introverted? Or does she just want to go to college online? Even if she is, so what? Introverted just means you get tired being around people for an extended period and prefer to be alone. Nothing she's doing sounds terrible, in fact, helping her mother pay off the house sounds smarter than moving in with you. I think you're what she's not comfortable with, probably because you're so pushy and derogatory, tbh", "YTA and she\u2019s 1000% right in saying you\u2019re the one who needs to grow up, and I might add, respect her fucking right to live her life as she wishes, regardless of how inconvenient it is to your sex life since this is obviously your motivation.", "YTA. I hope she dumps your ass.", "YTA\n\nYou whine about wanting her to grow up... \n\nYou two are world's apart in maturity levels but newsflash, I ain't talking about you being the mature one.", "YTA. I can see how you\u2019re frustrated because you want different things, but she\u2019s probably right you\u2019re too young to live together. It might be best to move on from her because this doesn\u2019t seem like an issue that will just solve itself", "Yta, this sounds like a *you* problem. You're still pretty young, too. Perhaps it's time to do some growing up of  your own.", "YTA", "So your wants/needs are more important than hers? You're demanding she leaves her comfort zone because you want to live together?

Why don\u2019t you get a job and a apartment yourself for you both to live in? Why is that her responsibility? Aren\u2019t you the immature one not working as she would have to support you? After all she\u2019s doing both studying and working full time where as you\u2019re just a student. She\u2019s got way more experience being an adult than you, she\u2019s working her ass off to get by and set herself up for the future by paying for the house. She\u2019s not dependent on her mother, she\u2019s investing in the house and paying the damn bills. What have you done recently? How much money do you bring in? I hope she reads this. Yta", "YTA.

It is entirely reasonable for her to still love with her parents.  And it\u2019s inappropriate for you pressure her into a relationship step she has told you she is not ready for.", "YTA and you show your immaturity by thinking being an adult is a linear progression of events (face to face college, leaving home, shacking up with a partner, cutting parental strings etc.) There are multiple reasons why the things she does may play out to be the smarter options in life.\n\nYou and your girlfriend are growing apart. Maybe this relationship is at an end. And you know what? That's OK. It happens often, especially at your ages. If it's not already too late, you two need to sit down and have a discussion about what you both want and what a future together might look like.\n\nWhat's not OK is belittling, insulting and pressuring your girlfriend for not reaching milestones you believe equate to maturity.", "YTA. She is far more put together and sensible then you are.", "YTA, she is 19, not 25. It's normal to still live with (one of) your parents at that age, especially when you are still studying. Being an adult is making wise financial choices, like saving money and not moving out while renting is very expensive.

I think she\u2019d be smart to cut you loose so you can live your on fun campus college life and she can live her life the way she wants to.", "YTA\n\n> I still love her but sometimes I wonder if we\u2019re drifting apart in terms of maturity.\n\nYeah she's growing up and being responsible, working full time while studying ***and*** helping pay off a mortgage.  \n\nMeanwhile you're complaining about her loving her family too much. \n\nShe's way outpacing you in maturity.  It's good that you're worrying about it because maybe you'll wise up.  \n\n> I think she needs to mature and grow up\n\nWhich of you is working full time and paying a mortgage again?\n\n>  I told her that she needs to grow up and realize that she\u2019s an adult now and she can\u2019t rely on her mommy forever.\n\nYou're the one stomping your feet like a child because you don't get your way.  She's taking care of her mother, not dependent on her.  You're the immature one here. \n\n> She said I\u2019m the one who needs to grow up because she isn\u2019t going to accommodate everything for me and she\u2019s literally working her ass off to support college for herself, bills, and splitting costs with her mom.\n\n100%", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re telling her that she needs to grow up when she has a full time job as is doing college courses, just because she is a bit dependent on her Mom and wants to help support said Mother, while you\u2019re just upset because you want to live together with her?\n\nYou\u2019re the one who needs to grow up, here, especially since you\u2019re asking 'should I have not dated someone so dependent on their parent'. Honestly, she deserves someone better than you.\n\nAlso, anxiety is not something you 'grow up' from, and if anyone needs to grow up here, it's you.", "YTA and she seems to be adulting just fine, thank you very much. She's got a full time job, full time schooling, paying the bills and getting shit done. There's nothing wrong with her living with her mom, especially since she is contributing to the household. You're being unreasonable and impatient. She's 19, there's no reason for her to rush into poverty and struggle.", "You\u2019re the immature one.\n\nYou want her to pay for something that she don\u2019t need when she is clear in her goal and is working toward it. \n\nAlso she is 19 so not exactly a fully build adult", "YTA, and you\u2019re seriously projecting here, because one of you is definitely more immature and it isn\u2019t her.", "I'm wondering if he wants her to move in with him so badly because she works full time and, you know, can pay for everything.", "She is also only 19, when I was 19 I was really not ready to live on my own. 19 might be legally a adult, but your brain isn't mature until you're between 20 and 25.", "I'd veto that. I think guilt tripping your girlfriend into moving in with you early actually is immature.", "Yeah. His need seems to be to save money on rent, tone done the chores by half at least and show off his relationship on campus.", "Honestly, it sounds like her mother is reliant on her, maybe physically. OP mentioned in a comment that she may be going into long term care soon. I get the feeling she wants to stay with her mom to have a little more time with her before she's possibly gone.", "Why do people on the internet act like you\u2019re some monster over a disagreement with a person?", "I don\u2019t like her mom very much so no. I wanted us to have an apartment in the city, but she told me she wanted to get her life together before living with eachother. But I have no desire to live with her mom.\n\nThere\u2019s a possibility her mom might go into a retirement home and she can have the house to herself, but I also don\u2019t really like her house and I prefer apartments.", "In another comment OP admits that he doesn\u2019t like her mom, and wouldn\u2019t even want to move into the house that girlfriend is helping with the mortgage (with her full time job, which she has as well as college!! I can\u2019t get over that this d-bag has the balls to call her immature) because it\u2019s too \u2018suburban and boring\u2019.\n\nI wish his GF would write in so I could tell her to just throw the whole man away.", "Yeah, I\u2019ve already given judgement in another post, but man is this guy starting to sound really sus. \n\nI mean, what\u2019s more grown up than having a full time job, paying bills and helping with a mortgage? \n\nI know I wasn\u2019t nearly that mature when I was 19!", "I think you're right there and even then that makes his gf much more mature than him as she's got her full-time job...", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I\u2019m worried she might end up unnecessarily relying on me by then.", "You obviously haven't read any of his comments, this guy is a total bag of trash", "That would be NAH", "Yeah, OP gives huge freeloader vibes", "Right? I don\u2019t think OP understands adult relationships. He\u2019s putting his partner down because\u2026 she is living with her mother and helps pay rent, but is \u201ctoo old\u201d at all of 19 years of age to be doing so? Give me a break.", "This is seriously what I\u2019m starting to suspect.", "It\u2019s not that you disagree, it\u2019s that you act like an entitled prick and make her feel bad because of it.\nBuy your own apartment, asshat", "They tend to when you\u2019re acting like an entitled asshat", "You literally asked should you have never dated her\n\nAre you a monster?\n\nOr is it only wrong when you are the victim?", "It\u2019s not that you disagreed.  It\u2019s that you responded to the disagreement by belittling and insulting your GF. \n\nYou know, the sort of thing that awful boyfriends do.", "Because you didn't have a disagreement.  You tossed insults.\n\nDisagreements don't include insults.  Fights do.  \n\nIf this is how you \"disagree\" with people on the regular then you're extremely immature.", "God, you never stop sinking yourself by trying to rise up, don\u2019t you", "INFO: Does her mother own the house? \nBy contributing is she (as well as being a good daughter) ensuring that she\u2019ll be on the property ladder? If so do you see how this is a better investment of money than paying rent? \n\nAdditional INFO: is this thing of her mother going into a retirement home something likely to happen soon, that is, is her mother\u2019s health not great? Is she in a sense (I don\u2019t necessarily mean as carer) taking care of her mother?", "I really hope your gf sees this post.\n\nYTA", "So you don\u2019t really your girlfriend, her life, her goals, or her living situation\u2026.\n\nBut if she\u2019d only change everything about herself you\u2019d be happier?\n\nYTA", "You should definitely have a discussion. People waste years of their lives because they wait for their partner to make a move and it never happens.", "I'm gonna guess the mom can tell he is a shitty boyfriend", "Right? At 19 I didn't even have it together enough to go to college!", "She has a full time job and goes to college, what do you do, mister \u201cextroverted\u201d?", "What the hell are you going on about? She has a full time job and she\u2019s doing college and she\u2019s paying bills and helping her mom with the mortgage!! How much more responsible is she supposed to be? \n\nYTA\n\nUnless you want to support this woman in the massive tasks she has - by being a good boyfriend rather than separating her from her only living family member - leave her the f alone.", "Sounds like it would be the other way around. Info: what kind of job do you have that would pay the rent on an apartment in the city and who pays your bills now?", "Condescending much?", "I don\u2019t frickin know man", "I did have a discussion. She told me she doesn\u2019t mind eventually living with me in her house if her mom ever moves out but I don\u2019t like her house. It\u2019s too suburban and boring.", "I'm sure OP would have mentioned if he had a (full-time) job as well. Probably might even have pointed out how much more he makes to emphasize how she might become too relying on him.\n\nThe vibe I get is that he's a professional son, paid by his parents, so he doesn't really have to think about housing costs and other expenses yet.", "How can you not know? This is your girlfriend of multiple years?! Do you just have no interest whatsoever in her life? You are 100% TA", "She's literally told you she doesn't like apartment living and doesn't want to move out of her house. Stop trying to make her into the person you want her to be. \n\nYou're starting to sound like a freeloader who NEEDS her in order to move into a nice apartment in the city. \n\nWhat is your current living situation like?", "You don\u2019t know if the house is rented or owned?", "Tell her how you actually feel. You guys don\u2019t sound compatible. Find a chick who isn\u2019t already invested in a house you hate and wants what you want then, if you can\u2019t stand her having different goals. Her mom needing to go into a retirement home at her age is actually a big deal. She\u2019s going through things you\u2019d never even think of having to deal with right now and you\u2019re calling her immature. Come on, my dude. Just be completely honest. She doesn\u2019t need to be strung along with your pressure on top.", "That might be a problem, she\u2019s emotionally tied to that house.
