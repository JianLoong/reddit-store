We were school buddies, college friends, my parents love him, we\u2019ve vacationed together many times. Taylor is a very affectionate person, kind, thoughtful guy.\n\nThree years ago me and Anne (31F) started dating, and now I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s the love of my life. Brilliant woman all around. We\u2019re getting married next January.\n\nThe Conflict: After a long and thoughtful conversation, my fiance voiced her concerns about inviting Taylor to our wedding. Basically, she had two main reasons for asking him that: 1. Dress Code: Taylor is a 30 year old punk. He wore a dress to our prom. You know , that kind of guy. 2. Taylor is dating a guy. Which is NOT the problem. But his partner is also very flamboyant.\n\nAnne wants a very minimalist, quiet, calm, wedding, because she struggles with anxiety and ADHD. So, that was her request.\n\nI talked to Taylor the next day, and I told him about Anne\u2019s concerns. Tay said \u201cdo you think I\u2019m gonna show up in a white dress?\u201d and laugh about it, but I told him he needed to promise he would respect the dress code. Black tuxedo for the guys\u2026 that was the code.\n\nI got a little caught in the moment so maybe I was harsher than I should\u2019ve been. I told him to \u2018man up\u2019 and to \u2018act his age'. I said some stupid stuff like \u2018people laugh about you, you want to be a joke?\u2019.\n\nHe said \u201cSure, no problem\u201d and the next day he declined the online invitation. He keeps telling me \u201cwe\u2019re good\u201d and everything is okay, but the situation it\u2019s bothering me.\n\nI love Tay, but I know he can be difficult. My group chat with my family is burning because they don\u2019t understand why he will not be there, and our friends' group chat is dead since the news dropped.

It\u2019s cruel. \n\nIf I was Taylor I wouldn\u2019t attend your wedding either. You need to apologize and take responsibility for being a prick if you have any chance of maintaining this friendship. Though idk why Taylor would want to.", "YTA\n\nFirst of all you show how intolerant you are of him expressing himself and him being comfortable in the clothes he wears. Then you go and use a gendered term, \"man up\" to a gay man who likes wearing dresses - so he needs to be a man and wear a tuxedo or he's not invited to your wedding. And you tell him to grow up, so you're saying that his gender expression is childish. And then you told him that he was a joke. You then say you love him. You don't love him. You'd only love the version of him that was a straight guy in a suit. That's not who he is, and you can't accept him the way he is.\n\nI'm not sure why this guy is even still speaking to you, because you're not the type of person I would want as a friend.", "YTA...\n\nYou could have just left it at \"We would love you to be there with your parner but ask that you please respect the dress code for our special event\" but instead you insulted your friend, told him he's a laughing stock, and implied that \"everyone laughs at you, you're a joke\".  You were a real asshole to someone you say you love and who is such a good friend.\n\nI'm surprised he told you that it's OK, because I bet it's NOT OK. and you should expect Taylor to distance from you and likely cut you out of their lives, because now you've shown him what you really think.", "YTA. You \"love him\" so much that basically told him he's a clown and that you are embarrassed of him, great friend you are, surely hope nothing is out off line for you and your dear fiance.", "Either you're leaving information out or you went from zero to sixty very quickly.  From your description,  you told your friend that your fiancee was afraid he was going to upstage her on her wedding day,  he made a lighthearted joke about it and your reaction was to insult him. In the end,  you and your fiancee got what you wanted - no risk of him or his boyfriend inflicting their flamboyance on your wedding day. YTA", "YTA. He said he would dress appropriately and then you insulted him.", "YTA.\n\nOne of her main concerns is that Taylor is dating a man. You heard that and thought \u201cthis is the person I want to marry?\u201d\n\nHow can you call someone your best friend but marry someone who judges them for being who they are? \n\nThe potential dress code issues are all red herrings. You are choosing your fianc\u00e9e, and by doing so are agreeing with her view that Taylor having a boyfriend is problematic.\n\nTaylor knew this immediately. You two are good because Taylor now knows exactly where he stands. He\u2019s done.", "YTA and let's be real here. You chose to say 'man up' because he wears dresses and you think that makes him less of a man.", "YTA. You could have asked nicely.\n\nInstead, you insulted him, belittled him... and you expected him to be ok with it ?", "YTA and I think you know it. That's your best friend and you telling him to \"man up and act his age\" sounds like you didn't like his true self through all the years you've been friends.\n\nI appreciate you recognizing your wife's concern and sorting it out with your friend but the way you did it was just not it. He probably felt unwelcomed and felt bad about himself. Ur an ass for that.", "YTA. You basically shit on who Taylor is as a person... his personality, the things he enjoys, the way he looks,  really just insulted everything about him. Of course he won't come to your wedding and I'm betting that \"burning up\" family chat would result in more people not coming if they knew just how judgmentally you treated someone you claim to care about. Same with the friends' chat.\n\nGo ahead, post both places exactly what you said to him. See what happens.", "Of course YTA. The only AH thing Taylor is doing is staying friends with you because it is incredibly disrespectful to his partner. \n\n\nYou want him to \"act his age,\" but accepting yourself for who you are and being kind to other people are way more mature traits than calling someone a \"punk\" and \"that kind of guy\". \n\n\nYou are a disgusting, bigoted homophobe who is not secure in what masculinity is.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s gay\u2026 it\u2019s just that he\u2019s GAY gay\u2026 you know?

Now read that back and ask yourself how you don\u2019t know that YTA. enjoy your white bread life with Anne, may there be no color or joy. You know, minimalist.", "YTA the friend group chat isn\u2019t dead, they started a new one without you.", "YTA. \n\nRealize that you are asking your friend to *NOT* be their authentic self at your wedding.\n\nAlso, \u201cman up\u201d is a toxic masculinity \ud83d\udea9", "YTA.  You really don't understand that it's not OK to tell a gay man who wears dresses to \"man up???\"  WTF?  And what does any of this have to do with his age?\n\nThis guy's supposed to be your best friend and you're being bigoted, shallow, and judgmental.", "YTA.\n\nYou and your fiancee need to agree on a guest list.  There are lots of ways to go through that decision-making process, and it would be fine not to invite him for whatever reason if you both agreed.\n\nAnd certainly, if you have a friend that doesn't seem to understand a dress code, then you can remind him what \"formal\" means.  After that it would be up to him whether to accept or decline your invitation.  And up to you to decide whether to have him removed from your wedding based on what he decided to wear.\n\nBut nowhere in there do you have a right to INSULT him and then be surprised if he doesn't want to come to your wedding.", "YTA - surely one of the things you love about Taylor is his uniqueness, but you want him to stifle himself for your wedding.  You assumed that he doesn't know the difference between going all out for a prom or a nightclub and a wedding.", "YTA, time to say bye bye to that friendship!", "YTA, you could've shown you were serious about the dress code without calling him a childish joke that people make fun of behind his back. What made you choose to be so cruel to someone you claim to care about?", "YTA, sounds like you used your fianc\u00e9s request to treat your \u201cfriend\u201d like a punching bag. No part of what you said was necessary. It\u2019s how I would talk to someone I hated more than I\u2019ve ever hated anyone.", "YTA. You guys are sending beaucoup microaggressions his way, telling him that his self-expression, including being not straight, is a problem for you. He needs to find friends who accept him for who he is.", "Inviting gay men does not automatically mean the wedding will not be calm and quiet, and if your fiance is thinking gay people = chaos and disturbance then she is a homophobe, or has homophobic family that she caters to.", "YTA, but I'm happy to know the cure for adhd has been found and it's been men in tuxedos all this time.", "YTA and your fianc\u00e9 is homophobic, concerned that a flamboyant guy is going to steal her thunder? \n\nAlso, he wore a dress to prom. How many years ago was that exactly? \n\nYou and your fianc\u00e9 both judged him for something that happened over 12 years ago. \n\nSounds like you two are the ones that need to grow up.", "I have ADHD and anxiety too\u2026but it doesn\u2019t make me homophobic nor is it an excuse to be.

Then again, it doesn't seem like you were too hard to manipulate.", "YTA dude.\n\nyou were fine with asking him to respect the dress code. he is, after all, a 'kind, thoughtful guy'. i've no doubt he would have respected it knowing it was important to you.\n\nwhy did you have to insult him? as a gay man, this can't be the first time he's been told he's not manly enough, that he'll grow out of it...\n\nas a queer man: i *know* this isn't how you intended it. but what you said is so so reminiscent of the things homophobic people say to gay men.\n\nit's gotta be pretty horrible to hear from a friend you've had forever.", "Wait, you think Taylor is difficult? YTA.", "Yta.  You could have reasonably brought up the dress code and informed him that the wedding was going to be conservative and low key. After saying blackbtux that should have been the end of it. Instead you continued into made a personal attack with insults and judgement. Making him and his partner feel unwelcome. I hope you enjoy your bland vanilla wedding with your  equally judgemental \"maybe\" love of your life because it's going to cost you more relationships going forward", "YTA. Not for asking him to adhere to a dress code, but for being unnecessarily cruel and homophobic.", "Someone definitely needs to man up in this situation. And it\u2019s not Taylor, YTA.\n\nThe reason the group chat is dead is because you\u2019re not in the new one.", "YTA you could have stopped at telling him the dress code, he most likely would have respected that but no you had to go all toxic masculinity and homophobic on him and lash out, also the fact your soon to be wife doesn\u2019t want him there or is wary of him going because he\u2019s \u201cpunk\u201d and \u201chis partner is flamboyantly gay\u201d reeks of homophobia, adhd and anxiety doesn\u2019t give her the excuse to be homophobic. You sir are a bad friend and Tyler and his bf deserve better, who needs enemies with \u201cfriends\u201d like you.", "Maybe your precious fianc\u00e9e is a bigot, have you thought about that? Though I get the feeling that you yourself are quite judgmental because of the way you describe Taylor. A simple \"mind the dress code\" would've sufficed but no, you had to insult him and his choices. He's not difficult, he just doesn't want to put up with your bullshit. And your fianc\u00e9e doesn't want guests, she wants props. Both of you sound insufferable and maybe Taylor is starting to realize it. YTA.", "Your fiancee can't stand people deviating from gender norms because of her... anxiety and ADHD???\n\nHm! That's not a symptom I've heard of before! \n\nShe's an AH for being so intolerant of your friend. YTA for not standing up for him, and double for insulting him yourself. \n\nPut this in perspective. Taylor has been your best friend \"since forever,\" in your own words. Anne has been in your life for three years. Why are you prioritizing her discomfort (and the flimsy reasons she gave for it) over your friend?\n\nEdit: thanks for my first awards, guys <3", "YTA - wow. You said all that you said and you think HE is the difficult one.\n\n\"I love you man, just don't be... all of this... at my wedding.\"\n\n\"You just pointed at all of me.\"\n\n\"Yes, all of that.\"", "YTA - Can you take a step back for a minute and see the full picture of what happened? You decided to use your wedding invitation as an excuse to tell \"Tay\" that you find his punk life-style and his flamboyant boyfriend embarrassing, childish, and a joke. You came across horribly judgmental and unkind. I'm happy that Tay respected himself and his boyfriend enough to decline. You really showed your ass here and likely ruined a very important relationship.", "YTA \n\nYou told him to \u201cman up\u201d, seriously?\n\nYeah, wave goodbye to that friendship.", "You say you don't have a problem with his gayness but you mention that he wore a dress to your prom, like that's was a bad thing. His fiance is flamboyant and you don't have a problem with it, but you made a point of telling him to tone down himself for your wedding, and then you use the words \"man up\"? \n\nYeah, YTA. It's your wedding, and you can decide how people dress, but this person is your friend, and from what you said, it sounds like this might be more about latent homophobia that the vibe of your wedding. This is what I call \"diet homophobia \" you don't have a problem with the gays as long as they're not rubbing their gayness or their flamboyance in your face. \n\nAnd don't use your fiance's ADHD as an excuse, people with ADHD are bothered by the environment. Their own clothes, loud noises and other stimulants, but I've never heard of a person with ADHD being bothered by another person choice of dress. \n\nIf the clothes really bother you that much, it's your wedding and you can decide how people dress, but ask yourself why your friend gayness and flamboyance bothers you.", " Sir. I, too, am medicated for and struggle with ADHD and anxiety. It does not make me a bigot. As soon as Taylor\u2019s boyfriend was described as flamboyant, I knew Anne was an AH.", "YTA, you told him to \"man up\" and that people laugh at him??

You've just made it very clear to Taylor that you don't respect him or his choices, so it's not surprising at all that he's not coming to your wedding. Consider it possible that you've lost him as a friend period. \n\nAlso, what do these things \n\n>Anne wants a very minimalist, quiet, calm, wedding, because she struggles with anxiety and ADHD.\n\nhave to do with each other? Sounds like she's just entering the \"everyone needs to look exactly the way I want them too for my wedding pictures, nothing else is allowed\" phase of bridezilla-dom. Tuxedos aren't \"minimalist\".", "YTA for the way in which you spoke to Taylor.\n\nAs for the dress code, you and your other half have the right to have a dress code for guests who wish to attend; equally, people you invite have every right to say \u2018no thanks\u2019.", "YTA and so is your fianc\u00e9. I am also someone who has ADHD and Anxiety and I wouldn\u2019t give a damn about who wears what at my wedding or anywhere else. It sounds like your fianc\u00e9 does not like your friend at all, whether she is actually homophobic or not remains to be seen. You say you think she\u2019s the love of your life but she might not be. I\u2019m betting your relationship with your childhood friend is permanently fractured if not already dead and buried. If your fianc\u00e9 is getting between you and your friend, you have a problem and if you side with your fianc\u00e9 who you\u2019ve known for three years, you\u2019ve got a bigger problem especially since you\u2019re not sure she is totally \u201cthe one\u201d. \n\nI think you and your fianc\u00e9 owe your friend an apology but who knows if he\u2019ll accept it. I wouldn\u2019t blame him if he didn\u2019t.", "While dress codes are a thing, it\u2019s usually indicated on the invitations, i.e., white tie, black tie, cocktail, casual, etc. You went about this completely wrong and were unnecessarily cruel to your so called best friend. \n\nYTA.", "YTA, it sounds like you were very disrespectful to your friend. Telling him that people laugh about him, really? That's really mean and not something a friend should say. All you had to do was tell him the dress code and he could either agree to it or not.", "YTA and you and your bride sound horrible to be around. I wouldn\u2019t go if I were your \u201cfriend\u201d", "YTA - You made it abundantly clear that although he was invited, 'Taylor' as you know him, is not welcome.", "YTA. You are welcome to set the terms of your wedding, and other people are allowed to decline the invitation if they don\u2019t feel comfortable going. \n\nAlso, if he\u2019s been your best friend forever, how come neither you nor your fianc\u00e9 have accepted him the way he is yet?", "What horrendous things to say to a supposed friend.", "YTA, bordering on this is fake. You're pretty sure you're marrying the love of your life? You call your best friend a joke (sneakily horrible thing to say to someone), and you think you aren't the AH? You want a calm, minimalist wedding, and your dress code for guests is black tux? Unless you're screwing over your guests, that kind of dress code implies that your wedding isn't going to be minimalist.", "YTA. Weddings usually have dresscodes so theres no problem with that. Even personally asking your friend to please stick to the dresscode and telling him It's important to you that he sticks to said dresscode is completely fine. What wasn't fine and what makes you an asshole is completely roasting your friend for the way he usually dresses. You went way, way to far there for absolutely no reason.", "YTA. You could have told him the dress code and dropped it but you decided to go in on him and insult him. Also, anxiety and ADHD.... I have both. My best friend is flamboyantly gay and it absolutely does not bother me so her excuse is definitely null. You're both TA.", "YTA - The only people being difficult here are you and your fianc\u00e9. People are not required to attend your wedding. And when you insult them, they usually choose not to. And when you insult and disparage one person, other friends will often come to their defense. Nobody wants to celebrate an AH. So congrats - sounds like you and your fianc\u00e9 are going to have a very quiet and calm wedding. \n\nJust a tip - maybe focus less time on your friend's fashion choices and more time on figuring out whether your fianc\u00e9 is actually the love of your life? Because most people want to be more than \"pretty sure\" before they decide to get married.", "YTA\n\nYou Insulted him.

Two, he did man up.  He had enough self respect to not go to a wedding where he wasn't welcome at.\n\nHe literally wasn't difficult, you didn't even give him a chance to be the \"kind thoughtful guy\" you claim he is.  You just assumed he'd be a dick and troll and ruin your wedding unless you put him in his place.", "YTA.\n\n> Anne wants a very minimalist, quiet, calm, wedding, because she struggles with anxiety and ADHD.\n\nYeah, no.  Someone who wants a quiet, calm wedding does not go out of their way to start drama over your LGBT guests showing up to the wedding as themselves, and they *certainly* don\u2019t blame that on \u201cADHD.\u201d  Kinda like you don\u2019t get to blame Tay for reassessing the friendship after you told him how *you* really feel about him and his approach to life.

You have known him practically your whole entire life so you know what his style and personality is. You\u2019ve claimed to accept him the way he is, yet his best friend, whom is more like family just shamed him because his fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t like his style and wants a certain dress code, that he joked about.  Did he outright deny wearing a tux? \n\nWhile she\u2019s not wrong, neither is Taylor for deciding not to attend the wedding where he\u2019s required to wear something he\u2019s not interested in wearing, or feels unwelcome as himself. Not to mention why would he want to celebrate the day with you when you are being so rude, mean and discriminatory towards him?\n\nAt the very least you owe him an apology. Even better would be to quit dictating what people wear to your event. Their presence should be enough. The aesthetic is not what shows they love you. If he\u2019s good enough for you in real day to day life, and worthy of sending the invitation to, then he should be able to be himself without judgement or criticism from you at your wedding too.

You can have a nice calm wedding for your fiance without having to put your friend in an uncomfortable situation. If the guy wants to show in a black sober dress, it shouldn't bother your fiance's anxiety and ADHD. Unless, of course, the issue is not the minimalism, it's the fact that a guy wears a dress. I'm sorry, but if that bothers her, it has nothing to do with any type of mental issue, your fiance is just intolerant. If this is the case, I don't see how can she be brilliant all around tbh. \n\nI think the best case scenario here is to accept your friend is not going to the wedding. You (as a couple) don't accept him how he is and obviously you have some sort of resentment towards him that you let out now.

What poise!   \n\n\nNow, there is a risk that this is also some form of passive-aggressive stuff\u2026 But from what I can see here, it seems like his silence is truly to give OP some space to figure his shit out. He seems to understand that weddings can be stressful and that the outbursts from OP were likely caused by this and what sounds like probable homophobia from the fianc\u00e9e.   \n\n\nI have ADHD, and the majority of my friend group is Neurodivergent in some form or another. I \\*do\\* understand that sometimes anxiety manifests in the desire to control other people. I can see how she would be extremely nervous about her wedding looking in a certain idealized way. I don\u2019t care at all about weddings in general, and I don\u2019t understand why everything has to be \\*Just so.\\* But it seems to be a thing. You want those pictures to be perfect, perhaps with a certain uniformity and rhythm. You want to stand out in your dress and having everyone else dressed in a bland way can certainly make that possible. So, I mean, sure it could not be homophobia and simply this anxiety-driven need for control. However, we also need to remember that we cannot use our mental health issues to control and oppress others.   \n\n\nIf OP is hoping to be a good husband, this would be a time to have a bit of a discussion with her. \u201cHey, honey, I understand you want the guests to look a certain way, but what would be the worst that can happen if Taylor showed up in a pink suit?\u201c And then they can walk through scenarios and find possible solutions, like excluding Taylor from (some) pictures, having him sit somewhere further from the bride and groom while dining, etc. As as partner, it isn\u2019t healthy to cave to all demands based on the other partner\u2019s mental health issues. And it is important to maintain other friendships, so it is also your job to protect said friends and make sure your partner doesn\u2019t overstep into their worlds.   \n\n\nI would also remember that it is important to avoid drama. DO NOT go to your friend passing on a message from your partner. If you are not on board or uncomfortable with what your partner wants that will affect your friends and family, you need to discuss that with your partner. Once you reach an agreement, then you go to your friends and family and say things like \u201cWe would prefer that everyone come dressed in jeans and a T at the dinner party,\u201c or \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t make it to Friday poker anymore. I prefer to stay home with my partner that night.\u201d (even if you wanted to go to poker, but your partner has issues with it, and you decided that it was worth giving up poker to accommodate your partner).  \n\n\nSo, it seems Taylor is being absolutely great about this. Go talk to him. Apologize for saying awful things (and they are absolutely awful). Tell him why you said them (homophobia can be buried in the unconscious \u2014 just something that we exist in, for example). Tell him how you have examined things and how you will Do better in the future. And invite him to the wedding again if you can in any way convince your Fianc\u00e9e to allow some variation in clothing. Even if I didn\u2019t dress flamboyant (and I DO), I would NEVER spend hundreds of dollars renting a tux for one day among friends. So consider that it is possible money is also an issue here.", "\"I'm not homophobic I just don't wanna see it\" OP is definitely one of those types.

I thought she was a bridesmaid?\" and they have to answer \"That's her there, I made her wear a wig and take out her piercings and she's squinting because I didn't allow her to wear her glasses, that's why she's completely unrecognizable.\"\n\nBut yeah I think there's likely some prejudice going on with this one, not just focus on aesthetics.", "Much of time, people are getting absolutely no thrill out of attending somebody's wedding.

We can infer things from the text and make assumptions about actual behavior to give the benefit of the doubt, but going purely on what OPs written, it seems the issue isn't behavior but simply that he wears a dress and his male presenting partner also dresses 'flamboyantly'.

Taylor is never going to be able to speak to him again without wondering if OP is also laughing at him behind his back, and how much misogynistic homophobic man-up bullshit would be pouring out of his mouth if there weren\u2019t social consequences. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the kind of damage you can apologize your way out of.", "This hurts my heart for Taylor just reading it.  How horrible to find out a \"friend\" for so long feels this way about you.", "Really? I was very grateful when someone I didn't consider a friend told me about some bullshit some people I did consider to be my friends were talking about me behind my back, and even worse to me were the people that didn't talk shit themselves, but didn't warn me that I trust the wrong people either.", "You know the worst part, in my mind the you know people laugh about you thing means your best friend probably sat there and listened and did nothing to defend you against that behaviour.  He did not and does not have his best friends back. \n\nAlso the flamboyant shit had me getting my dander up too it screams hostility to his boyfriend.", "I'm a trans man, and Taylor *shouldn't* forgive OP. He's the kind of ugly nobody needs in their life. I only wish OP hadn't been so much of a coward that he hid his true feelings for a fucking decade. What a chode.", "I caught that pretty sure, too, and thought it very odd.. They're getting married next month and he's only \"pretty sure\"? They've been together for 3 years, most of which was pandemic times? I have a feeling if we ever get an update on this one, it will be a friendless guy in a loveless marriage. And he'll have only himself to blame.", "And OP is 100% queerphobic as well since he's still hung up on his friend being a \"man in a dress\" from 15 years ago.", "Ya I'm ADHD and riddled with depression and anxiety. Me and my SO both bend gender norms. They are 30 and wear loads of punk/alt clothes both male and female stuff. I'm almost 29 and have struggled with expressing myself my whole life. I dress pretty androgynous but when I'm feeling confident I wear my pretty and frilly dresses.\n\nBeing ND doesn't make you a bigot. Your assholery does. I've been told to \"man up\" and my SO always jumps in to tell people off. I'm also fairly lucky because I have a decently sized package, and my SO loves throwing it in people's faces when they say dumb shit like that, 95% of the time it shuts them up in the \"manhood\" department. \n\nI'm lucky my SO is my voice when I can't find the strength to speak up for myself.", "The only thing that would *sort of* make sense is if she has more Conservative family members and she's worried about rustling some jimmies. \n\nBut that's still a shit excuse. Would explain the thinly-veiled homophobia if that's the sort of crowd she was raised in. \n\nAnd just to reinforce: OP, YTA. 100%. If I were in Taylor's shoes, I'd be cutting you out of my life real quick. Your phrasing was completely unnecessary.", "I\u2019m so sad for Taylor. He was probably completely blindsided. Although, it\u2019s entirely possible hints of OP\u2019s attitude were trickling out, but this was the first time he did something this egregious.", "She's the one making a requirement of a gendered dress code, sounds like she's homophobic too, and in that is an AH", "As a queer woman with ADHD and anxiety, I\u2019m just so thankful to be married to a hetero man so he can keep me on the straight and narrow. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d get through the day otherwise. /s", "Me too, I\u2019m almost personally offended that they\u2019d use the disorders that I also have as an excuse for homophobia", "'We also only invited our white friends, cause we're minimalists'", "I have never felt so seen in my entire life as this comment makes me feel.", "I read that as \u201cI can\u2019t even gay attention\u201d", "Pls do, I will vibrate threateningly in the meantime.", "If I could upvote this multiple times.

Taylor doesn\u2019t need friends like these.\n\nOp, you and Annie are definitely the flaming A H. Yup YtA.", "All of this. My thought was he could still follow the dress code and wear a formal dress that follows the dress code. \nShe/he don\u2019t want a man in a dress at the wedding.", "And the cherry on top, \u201cman up.\u201d", "The was a big red flag before we even got to the drama red flags. lol Engaged to someone you\u2019re not even sure about.. Who tells on themselves like that?! \ud83d\ude06", "Like if he's not sure, why is he marrying her?", "I noticed this too. Reminds me of the woman who recently said her relationship with her husband was \"quite close\". Jeez.", "I have the full spectrum of anxiety disorders and told friends to wear \"whatever makes you feel good\" to my wedding.  People did not disappoint - formal, punk, 80s style, sequins, disco - it was a riot and I loved it.\n\nThis reads more to me like OP's fianc\u00e9 is more interested in conformity and not having their flamboyance stand out or draw attention.", "And Taylor handled it really well. I\u2019m sure it was an awkward conversation, yet he managed \u201cDo you think I\u2019m going to show up in a white dress?\u201d Which was funny! OP could have laughed, said \u201cMaybe! But, no, seriously, I told my fianc\u00e9 I\u2019d make sure everyone was clear on the dress code. See you there!\u201d Done. Easy. Crisis averted. \n\nBut I suspect someone would have found a reason to shit on Taylor and his partner anyway because that\u2019s what OP did when Taylor responded in a totally normal, good-natured way to being treated like a child. I think he knows what you wear to a wedding with a black-tie dress code.", "It's giving \"it's ok just don't rub it in my face that you're gay\"", "It\u2019s super crazy to me that this is OPs life long best friend. And he\u2019s marrying this woman after 3 years. And he\u2019s willing to tell his best friend not be himself because my fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t like it. \n\nI would have dumped that girl as soon as she stared being incompatible with my lifelong best friend. But I guess OP deserves his fianc\u00e9", "It\u2019s very homophobic.", "Are you lgbtq?", "But, but, but Taylor wore a DRESS to PROM!! He's THAT guy!!! This is all about Op and his fiancee's homophobia. They don't want his gay friend to embarrass them with their eccentricities.\n\nIf it were just about the wardrobe he would have explained the dress code and left it at that. Anyone with an ounce of common sense would understand a bride wants to be the focus on her wedding day. She doesn't want competition by any of the attendees. There was no need for the \"man up\" comment.", "Don't you know? All gay people show up to every event in full drag with all the sparkles....yeah she's definitely got some homophobia to work through. They're the types that have gay friends so they think it excuses those types of thoughts.", "I can kinda see your point here. The way OP worded it does make it sound a little homophobic. Why specify that the dude's partner is also a dude? Could have just left it at \"Taylor's partner is also rather flamboyant\". Even having \"Taylor's boyfriend\" would have landed better with me", "Queer here, I have seen some crazy shit worn to weddings (think prosthetic breasts, nothing but a sheer top over them). *Most* of the time, this is done at weddings where the couple is a-ok with it, but I know 1 person (there\u2019s always that one person) who is very much contrarian to the extreme, 50/50 chance (s)he\u2019d either wear a white dress or a Canadian tuxedo (all denim). Although unlikely, it is possible OPs friends boyfriend is this extra. Either way though, OP still botched this entirely.", "Came here to post that snippet too. Absolutely REEKS of homophobia", "Plus Anne wanted to not invite Taylor and his partner, which is exactly homophobic, without ever having to say it out loud.", "Exactly and his wife didn't even want him there already because of the whole you can tell issue :/", "1. The dress code is what you and your fianc\u00e9e make it. Nothing and nobody but you and your fianc\u00e9e are making it mandatory for men to wear a tuxedo. \n2. You are telling him to \"man up\", but it sounds like you are telling him and his partner to \"straighten up\".  Declining your invitations, and not flat out telling your family and friends why, is the most civil way for Tayler to handle your demands. He has the high ground here. He could have been a lot less civil and I, for one, would not call him an AH for doing so.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nBy the way you spoke to him you clearly have some unresolved issues. Anger because he gets attention you don't? Perhaps some unspoken homophobia you don't want to admit to yourself let alone anyone else?\n\nYour response was very childish, hateful, and plain nasty. If I were him this friendship would be done. You can't undone the things you said and the underlying bs that goes with it.\n\nI highly doubt he is dumb enough to believe your behavior was because of your fiance's anxiety. I say that as someone who has been doctor diagnosed for decades with anxiety.", "And i bet the first message on that one was \"can you believe this asshole?\"", "They are absolutely on a new chat.", "this. i have no other words. the nail's head was hit.", "That was my first thought when I read that too!!", "The funniest thing is Taylor sounds like the one handling this like a mature adult. Not starting shit on the phone call, by all accounts not starting drama and shit in the social group. \n\nSounds like he heard years of resentment from the OP pouring out like one of those stupid \"we're not kids anymore\" scenes between best friends in movies, just so much worse and in real life. \n\nHe made the right move fucking off, it sounds like OP didn't want him there in the first place.", "\"we're good\" =/= \"It's okay\"\n\nGuaranteed taylor has written off OP as a friend.", "Oh come on now, he didn\u2019t imply that everyone laughs at him and he\u2019s a joke at all.

What kind of arrogant, disrespectful, AH speaks that way to someone they claim to consider a close friend?\n\nYTA, OP. Congratulations on ending a lifelong friendship over your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s bigotry and prejudice.", "Yeah.\n\nIf someone I'd been friends with for ages came out of the blue and basically told me I was a joke to everyone, I would delete their number and never speak to them again.\n\nThere is no age when you magically become a button-down, no-fun-allowed adult. It happens when you let the bastards grind you down.\n\nTaylor sounds fuckin awesome. OP, though, not so much.", "YTA\n\nTell me what you really think about me without really telling me what you think of me. \n\nI'm straight but not generally the manliest guy in the room. If a so-called friend told me to butch it up and that other people laughed at me behind my back, that would be the end of our friendship.", "To borrow from someone else's joke above:\n\nNarrator:  Taylor did, in fact, have a problem.", "I regret that I have but one upvote to give to this comment.", "I\u2019m genuinely surprised OP is even friends with a member of the LGBTQ community considering he\u2019s marrying a bigot.", "Cause OP is just as much of a queerphobe as his bride is. Dude's still got his panties twisted over a \"man wearing a dress\" 15 years ago.", "Right? The guy wore a dress to prom, so obviously he doesn\u2019t respect any formal event? OP needs to grow the fuck up.", "I wonder how many ppl in the group chat are gonna back out of the wedding too", "Yes it makes the fiance the \"bad guy\" because it says it's fiancee's important need.  OP should have said \" hey, it important to fiancee and I that everyone respects the dress code.\"  But then OP went way beyond that point and off the deep end. \"Man up\"?  That's a direct punch at Taylor being gay and dressing flamboyantly from time to time.  Thinking as much as OP says Taylor's his good friend, OP does have a problem with Taylor being gay and doing things, dressing certain ways --- probably way less obvious than wearing a prom dress --- and doesn't want to fess up to his own discomfort with Taylor.      OP was too pointed and hurt Taylor about something that is who Taylor is.  Yes, it's okay to expect everyone to abide by a wedding dress code, but OP went way beyond letting Taylor know that he expected Taylor to follow the dress like everyone else.  I think OP was worried Taylor would comply with the wedding dress code by wearing a compliant dress....\nTaylor is OP's friend yet he said very hurtful things.  YTA.", "Even beyond what he said, it\u2019s the meaning behind them. \u201cI\u2019m not okay that you\u2019re yourself; don\u2019t act gay around me; I have no respect for you as a person.\u201d Those are the subtexts and are even less forgivable.", "Oh no, you misunderstand! They\u2019re invited, *but\u2026* they have to stand on opposite sides of the room at all times, they\u2019re not allowed to make eye contact, and if there\u2019s any slow dance whatsoever, they *will* have to remain sitting down. Can\u2019t have \u201cthe gays\u201d dancing in front of the homophobic relatives! /s\n\n(To clarify, just in case: I am being 100% sarcastic. I\u2019m bisexual, I\u2019ve got ADHD, and OP and his fianc\u00e9e are being homophobic as hell. OP is totally TA here.)", "That's even assuming they're invited since how they getting \"very minimalist, quiet, calm\". My thought is just elope, its very minimal, quiet and calm.", "I just straight up didn't understand what he meant by \"that kind of guy\", then read Taylor has a boyfriend and went \"oh...oh no...\"", "Exactly. We don't really know. All I know is OP seems like a dick, and either was unnecessarily mean to his friend, or omitted vital information in this post.", "Honestly I think expecting someone to change their hair or take their piercings out for a wedding is also over the top.
