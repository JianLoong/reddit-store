We were school buddies, college friends, my parents love him, we\u2019ve vacationed together many times. Taylor is a very affectionate person, kind, thoughtful guy.\n\nThree years ago me and Anne (31F) started dating, and now I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s the love of my life. Brilliant woman all around. We\u2019re getting married next January.\n\nThe Conflict: After a long and thoughtful conversation, my fiance voiced her concerns about inviting Taylor to our wedding. Basically, she had two main reasons for asking him that: 1. Dress Code: Taylor is a 30 year old punk. He wore a dress to our prom. You know , that kind of guy. 2. Taylor is dating a guy. Which is NOT the problem. But his partner is also very flamboyant.\n\nAnne wants a very minimalist, quiet, calm, wedding, because she struggles with anxiety and ADHD. So, that was her request.\n\nI talked to Taylor the next day, and I told him about Anne\u2019s concerns. Tay said \u201cdo you think I\u2019m gonna show up in a white dress?\u201d and laugh about it, but I told him he needed to promise he would respect the dress code. Black tuxedo for the guys\u2026 that was the code.\n\nI got a little caught in the moment so maybe I was harsher than I should\u2019ve been. I told him to \u2018man up\u2019 and to \u2018act his age'. I said some stupid stuff like \u2018people laugh about you, you want to be a joke?\u2019.\n\nHe said \u201cSure, no problem\u201d and the next day he declined the online invitation. He keeps telling me \u201cwe\u2019re good\u201d and everything is okay, but the situation it\u2019s bothering me.\n\nI love Tay, but I know he can be difficult. My group chat with my family is burning because they don\u2019t understand why he will not be there, and our friends' group chat is dead since the news dropped.

It\u2019s cruel. \n\nIf I was Taylor I wouldn\u2019t attend your wedding either. You need to apologize and take responsibility for being a prick if you have any chance of maintaining this friendship. Though idk why Taylor would want to.", "YTA\n\nFirst of all you show how intolerant you are of him expressing himself and him being comfortable in the clothes he wears. Then you go and use a gendered term, \"man up\" to a gay man who likes wearing dresses - so he needs to be a man and wear a tuxedo or he's not invited to your wedding. And you tell him to grow up, so you're saying that his gender expression is childish. And then you told him that he was a joke. You then say you love him. You don't love him. You'd only love the version of him that was a straight guy in a suit. That's not who he is, and you can't accept him the way he is.\n\nI'm not sure why this guy is even still speaking to you, because you're not the type of person I would want as a friend.", "YTA...\n\nYou could have just left it at \"We would love you to be there with your parner but ask that you please respect the dress code for our special event\" but instead you insulted your friend, told him he's a laughing stock, and implied that \"everyone laughs at you, you're a joke\".  You were a real asshole to someone you say you love and who is such a good friend.\n\nI'm surprised he told you that it's OK, because I bet it's NOT OK. and you should expect Taylor to distance from you and likely cut you out of their lives, because now you've shown him what you really think.", "YTA. You \"love him\" so much that basically told him he's a clown and that you are embarrassed of him, great friend you are, surely hope nothing is out off line for you and your dear fiance.", "Either you're leaving information out or you went from zero to sixty very quickly.  From your description,  you told your friend that your fiancee was afraid he was going to upstage her on her wedding day,  he made a lighthearted joke about it and your reaction was to insult him. In the end,  you and your fiancee got what you wanted - no risk of him or his boyfriend inflicting their flamboyance on your wedding day. YTA", "YTA. He said he would dress appropriately and then you insulted him.", "YTA.\n\nOne of her main concerns is that Taylor is dating a man. You heard that and thought \u201cthis is the person I want to marry?\u201d\n\nHow can you call someone your best friend but marry someone who judges them for being who they are? \n\nThe potential dress code issues are all red herrings. You are choosing your fianc\u00e9e, and by doing so are agreeing with her view that Taylor having a boyfriend is problematic.\n\nTaylor knew this immediately. You two are good because Taylor now knows exactly where he stands. He\u2019s done.", "YTA and let's be real here. You chose to say 'man up' because he wears dresses and you think that makes him less of a man.", "YTA. You could have asked nicely.\n\nInstead, you insulted him, belittled him... and you expected him to be ok with it ?", "YTA and I think you know it. That's your best friend and you telling him to \"man up and act his age\" sounds like you didn't like his true self through all the years you've been friends.\n\nI appreciate you recognizing your wife's concern and sorting it out with your friend but the way you did it was just not it. He probably felt unwelcomed and felt bad about himself. Ur an ass for that.", "YTA. You basically shit on who Taylor is as a person... his personality, the things he enjoys, the way he looks,  really just insulted everything about him. Of course he won't come to your wedding and I'm betting that \"burning up\" family chat would result in more people not coming if they knew just how judgmentally you treated someone you claim to care about. Same with the friends' chat.\n\nGo ahead, post both places exactly what you said to him. See what happens.", "Of course YTA. The only AH thing Taylor is doing is staying friends with you because it is incredibly disrespectful to his partner. \n\n\nYou want him to \"act his age,\" but accepting yourself for who you are and being kind to other people are way more mature traits than calling someone a \"punk\" and \"that kind of guy\". \n\n\nYou are a disgusting, bigoted homophobe who is not secure in what masculinity is.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s gay\u2026 it\u2019s just that he\u2019s GAY gay\u2026 you know?

Now read that back and ask yourself how you don\u2019t know that YTA. enjoy your white bread life with Anne, may there be no color or joy. You know, minimalist.", "YTA the friend group chat isn\u2019t dead, they started a new one without you.", "YTA. \n\nRealize that you are asking your friend to *NOT* be their authentic self at your wedding.\n\nAlso, \u201cman up\u201d is a toxic masculinity \ud83d\udea9", "YTA.  You really don't understand that it's not OK to tell a gay man who wears dresses to \"man up???\"  WTF?  And what does any of this have to do with his age?\n\nThis guy's supposed to be your best friend and you're being bigoted, shallow, and judgmental.", "YTA.\n\nYou and your fiancee need to agree on a guest list.  There are lots of ways to go through that decision-making process, and it would be fine not to invite him for whatever reason if you both agreed.\n\nAnd certainly, if you have a friend that doesn't seem to understand a dress code, then you can remind him what \"formal\" means.  After that it would be up to him whether to accept or decline your invitation.  And up to you to decide whether to have him removed from your wedding based on what he decided to wear.\n\nBut nowhere in there do you have a right to INSULT him and then be surprised if he doesn't want to come to your wedding.", "YTA - surely one of the things you love about Taylor is his uniqueness, but you want him to stifle himself for your wedding.  You assumed that he doesn't know the difference between going all out for a prom or a nightclub and a wedding.", "YTA, time to say bye bye to that friendship!", "YTA, you could've shown you were serious about the dress code without calling him a childish joke that people make fun of behind his back. What made you choose to be so cruel to someone you claim to care about?", "YTA, sounds like you used your fianc\u00e9s request to treat your \u201cfriend\u201d like a punching bag. No part of what you said was necessary. It\u2019s how I would talk to someone I hated more than I\u2019ve ever hated anyone.", "YTA. You guys are sending beaucoup microaggressions his way, telling him that his self-expression, including being not straight, is a problem for you. He needs to find friends who accept him for who he is.", "Inviting gay may does not automatically mean the wedding will not be calm and quiet, and if your fiance is thinking gay people = chaos and disturbance then she is a homophobe, or has homophobic family that she caters to.", "YTA, but I'm happy to know the cure for adhd has been found and it's been men in tuxedos all this time.", "YTA and your fianc\u00e9 is homophobic, concerned that a flamboyant guy is going to steal her thunder? \n\nAlso, he wore a dress to prom. How many years ago was that exactly? \n\nYou and your fianc\u00e9 both judged him for something that happened over 12 years ago. \n\nSounds like you two are the ones that need to grow up.", "I have ADHD and anxiety too\u2026but it doesn\u2019t make me homophobic nor is it an excuse to be.

Wow...... who needs enemies with friends like you?\n\nYou and your fiance (who you only *think* may be the love of your life???) deserve each other.

Then again, it doesn't seem like you were too hard to manipulate.", "YTA dude.\n\nyou were fine with asking him to respect the dress code. he is, after all, a 'kind, thoughtful guy'. i've no doubt he would have respected it knowing it was important to you.\n\nwhy did you have to insult him? as a gay man, this can't be the first time he's been told he's not manly enough, that he'll grow out of it...\n\nas a queer man: i *know* this isn't how you intended it. but what you said is so so reminiscent of the things homophobic people say to gay men.\n\nit's gotta be pretty horrible to hear from a friend you've had forever.", "Wait, you think Taylor is difficult? YTA.", "Yta.  You could have reasonably brought up the dress code and informed him that the wedding was going to be conservative and low key. After saying blackbtux that should have been the end of it. Instead you continued into made a personal attack with insults and judgement. Making him and his partner feel unwelcome. I hope you enjoy your bland vanilla wedding with your  equally judgemental \"maybe\" love of your life because it's going to cost you more relationships going forward", "YTA. Not for asking him to adhere to a dress code, but for being unnecessarily cruel and homophobic.", "Someone definitely needs to man up in this situation. And it\u2019s not Taylor, YTA.\n\nThe reason the group chat is dead is because you\u2019re not in the new one.", "YTA you could have stopped at telling him the dress code, he most likely would have respected that but no you had to go all toxic masculinity and homophobic on him and lash out, also the fact your soon to be wife doesn\u2019t want him there or is wary of him going because he\u2019s \u201cpunk\u201d and \u201chis partner is flamboyantly gay\u201d reeks of homophobia, adhd and anxiety doesn\u2019t give her the excuse to be homophobic. You sir are a bad friend and Tyler and his bf deserve better, who needs enemies with \u201cfriends\u201d like you.", "Maybe your precious fianc\u00e9e is a bigot, have you thought about that? Though I get the feeling that you yourself are quite judgmental because of the way you describe Taylor. A simple \"mind the dress code\" would've sufficed but no, you had to insult him and his choices. He's not difficult, he just doesn't want to put up with your bullshit. And your fianc\u00e9e doesn't want guests, she wants props. Both of you sound insufferable and maybe Taylor is starting to realize it. YTA.", "Your fiancee can't stand people deviating from gender norms because of her... anxiety and ADHD???\n\nHm! That's not a symptom I've heard of before! \n\nShe's an AH for being so intolerant of your friend. YTA for not standing up for him, and double for insulting him yourself. \n\nPut this in perspective. Taylor has been your best friend \"since forever,\" in your own words. Anne has been in your life for three years. Why are you prioritizing her discomfort (and the flimsy reasons she gave for it) over your friend?", "YTA - wow. You said all that you said and you think HE is the difficult one.\n\n\"I love you man, just don't be... all of this... at my wedding.\"\n\n\"You just pointed at all of me.\"\n\n\"Yes, all of that.\"", "YTA - Can you take a step back for a minute and see the full picture of what happened? You decided to use your wedding invitation as an excuse to tell \"Tay\" that you find his punk life-style and his flamboyant boyfriend embarrassing, childish, and a joke. You came across horribly judgmental and unkind. I'm happy that Tay respected himself and his boyfriend enough to decline. You really showed your ass here and likely ruined a very important relationship.", "YTA \n\nYou told him to \u201cman up\u201d, seriously?\n\nYeah, wave goodbye to that friendship.", "You say you don't have a problem with his gayness but you mention that he wore a dress to your prom, like that's was a bad thing. His fiance is flamboyant and you don't have a problem with it, but you made a point of telling him to tone down himself for your wedding, and then you use the words \"man up\"? \n\nYeah, YTA. It's your wedding, and you can decide how people dress, but this person is your friend, and from what you said, it sounds like this might be more about latent homophobia that the vibe of your wedding. This is what I call \"diet homophobia \" you don't have a problem with the gays as long as they're not rubbing their gayness or their flamboyance in your face. \n\nAnd don't use your fiance's ADHD as an excuse, people with ADHD are bothered by the environment. Their own clothes, loud noises and other stimulants, but I've never heard of a person with ADHD being bothered by another person choice of dress. \n\nIf the clothes really bother you that much, it's your wedding and you can decide how people dress, but ask yourself why your friend gayness and flamboyance bothers you.", " Sir. I, too, am medicated for and struggle with ADHD and anxiety. It does not make me a bigot. As soon as Taylor\u2019s boyfriend was described as flamboyant, I knew Anne was an AH.", "YTA, you told him to \"man up\" and that people laugh at him??

You've just made it very clear to Taylor that you don't respect him or his choices, so it's not surprising at all that he's not coming to your wedding. Consider it possible that you've lost him as a friend period. \n\nAlso, what do these things \n\n>Anne wants a very minimalist, quiet, calm, wedding, because she struggles with anxiety and ADHD.\n\nhave to do with each other?

Tuxedos aren't \"minimalist\".", "YTA for the way in which you spoke to Taylor.\n\nAs for the dress code, you and your other half have the right to have a dress code for guests who wish to attend; equally, people you invite have every right to say \u2018no thanks\u2019.", "YTA and so is your fianc\u00e9. I am also someone who has ADHD and Anxiety and I wouldn\u2019t give a damn about who wears what at my wedding or anywhere else. It sounds like your fianc\u00e9 does not like your friend at all, whether she is actually homophobic or not remains to be seen. You say you think she\u2019s the love of your life but she might not be. I\u2019m betting your relationship with your childhood friend is permanently fractured if not already dead and buried. If your fianc\u00e9 is getting between you and your friend, you have a problem and if you side with your fianc\u00e9 who you\u2019ve known for three years, you\u2019ve got a bigger problem especially since you\u2019re not sure she is totally \u201cthe one\u201d. \n\nI think you and your fianc\u00e9 owe your friend an apology but who knows if he\u2019ll accept it. I wouldn\u2019t blame him if he didn\u2019t.", "While dress codes are a thing, it\u2019s usually indicated on the invitations, i.e., white tie, black tie, cocktail, casual, etc. You went about this completely wrong and were unnecessarily cruel to your so called best friend. \n\nYTA.", "YTA, it sounds like you were very disrespectful to your friend. Telling him that people laugh about him, really? That's really mean and not something a friend should say. All you had to do was tell him the dress code and he could either agree to it or not.", "YTA and you and your bride sound horrible to be around. I wouldn\u2019t go if I were your \u201cfriend\u201d", "YTA - You made it abundantly clear that although he was invited, 'Taylor' as you know him, is not welcome.", "YTA. You are welcome to set the terms of your wedding, and other people are allowed to decline the invitation if they don\u2019t feel comfortable going. \n\nAlso, if he\u2019s been your best friend forever, how come neither you nor your fianc\u00e9 have accepted him the way he is yet?", "What horrendous things to say to a supposed friend.", "YTA, bordering on this is fake. You're pretty sure you're marrying the love of your life? You call your best friend a joke (sneakily horrible thing to say to someone), and you think you aren't the AH? You want a calm, minimalist wedding, and your dress code for guests is black tux? Unless you're screwing over your guests, that kind of dress code implies that your wedding isn't going to be minimalist.", "YTA. Weddings usually have dresscodes so theres no problem with that. Even personally asking your friend to please stick to the dresscode and telling him It's important to you that he sticks to said dresscode is completely fine. What wasn't fine and what makes you an asshole is completely roasting your friend for the way he usually dresses. You went way, way to far there for absolutely no reason.", "YTA. You could have told him the dress code and dropped it but you decided to go in on him and insult him. Also, anxiety and ADHD.... I have both. My best friend is flamboyantly gay and it absolutely does not bother me so her excuse is definitely null. You're both TA.", "YTA - The only people being difficult here are you and your fianc\u00e9. People are not required to attend your wedding. And when you insult them, they usually choose not to. And when you insult and disparage one person, other friends will often come to their defense. Nobody wants to celebrate an AH. So congrats - sounds like you and your fianc\u00e9 are going to have a very quiet and calm wedding. \n\nJust a tip - maybe focus less time on your friend's fashion choices and more time on figuring out whether your fianc\u00e9 is actually the love of your life? Because most people want to be more than \"pretty sure\" before they decide to get married.", "YTA\n\nYou Insulted him.

Two, he did man up.  He had enough self respect to not go to a wedding where he wasn't welcome at.\n\nHe literally wasn't difficult, you didn't even give him a chance to be the \"kind thoughtful guy\" you claim he is.  You just assumed he'd be a dick and troll and ruin your wedding unless you put him in his place.", "YTA.\n\n> Anne wants a very minimalist, quiet, calm, wedding, because she struggles with anxiety and ADHD.\n\nYeah, no.  Someone who wants a quiet, calm wedding does not go out of their way to start drama over your LGBT guests showing up to the wedding as themselves, and they *certainly* don\u2019t blame that on \u201cADHD.\u201d  Kinda like you don\u2019t get to blame Tay for reassessing the friendship after you told him how *you* really feel about him and his approach to life.

You have known him practically your whole entire life so you know what his style and personality is. You\u2019ve claimed to accept him the way he is, yet his best friend, whom is more like family just shamed him because his fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t like his style and wants a certain dress code, that he joked about.  Did he outright deny wearing a tux? \n\nWhile she\u2019s not wrong, neither is Taylor for deciding not to attend the wedding where he\u2019s required to wear something he\u2019s not interested in wearing, or feels unwelcome as himself. Not to mention why would he want to celebrate the day with you when you are being so rude, mean and discriminatory towards him?\n\nAt the very least you owe him an apology. Even better would be to quit dictating what people wear to your event. Their presence should be enough. The aesthetic is not what shows they love you. If he\u2019s good enough for you in real day to day life, and worthy of sending the invitation to, then he should be able to be himself without judgement or criticism from you at your wedding too.

You can have a nice calm wedding for your fiance without having to put your friend in an uncomfortable situation. If the guy wants to show in a black sober dress, it shouldn't bother your fiance's anxiety and ADHD. Unless, of course, the issue is not the minimalism, it's the fact that a guy wears a dress. I'm sorry, but if that bothers her, it has nothing to do with any type of mental issue, your fiance is just intolerant. If this is the case, I don't see how can she be brilliant all around tbh. \n\nI think the best case scenario here is to accept your friend is not going to the wedding. You (as a couple) don't accept him how he is and obviously you have some sort of resentment towards him that you let out now.

Color me skeptical this is about the dress code only.", "Which is not to say that the partner being flamboyant *isn't* seen as a problem, but if that was the *full extent* of the problem then there would be no need to have specified the partner's gender.\n\nAfter all, a woman can wear an outrageously flamboyant and wedding-inappropriate outfit just as easily as a man can.", "I'd guess the ADHD thing is more about obsessing over what the guests would/could wear and having that cause stress and anxiety before the actual wedding. Sounds like she was looking for confirmation/peace of mind that Taylor + partner would follow the dress code.", "Yep. He gave himself away.", "Well that triggers his wonderful bride\u2019s anxiety, you know? Because apparently we\u2019re calling homophobia \u201canxiety\u201d now. \ud83d\ude44", "Which makes me wonder if op knows and just doesn't care? His best friend is gay, certainly something had to come up regarding homophobia in their relationship? I've dated guys and generally within the first few months any type of racism or homophobia presents itself by then", "Ding ding ding!", "I'm all aboard the ADHD and anxiety train. That excuse reeks of bullshit to me.\nOP and his fiance deserve each other.\nHopefully none of their children deviate from what they consider to be \"the norm\" or that poor child will have all individuality crushed out of them by the time they're 10.\n\nYTA.", "Having a \u201cminimalist\u201d wedding and also requiring tuxedos is very strange.", "Same here \ud83d\ude02 in fact I would have been looking forward to it even more just to see what my new husbands flamboyant best mate was gonna wear tbh", "I know right? I'm usually so worried about what I'm wearing that I can't be bothered to worry about how others look.  I find it ironic that this guy is trying to use his fiance's adhd and anxiety as some kind of excuse for them being such a holes. Stupid things like \"dress codes\" can really aggravate ADHD and anxiety for me (it's hard enough just to get there on time, but i also gotta worry about wearing really specific clothes?).", "Generally we are too focused on how much everyone must hate *us* and what we are wearing.", "Because it was presented as a negative and a reason to be concerned about Tyler\u2019s presence.", "Yes, this. \n\nBut also my point was more specifically that whether or not she has ADHD and anxiety, caring about the aesthetic of your wedding and how pictures will look is a choice, not something you need to do in order to function on your wedding day as a result of your mental illness.", "She\u2019s using that as a cover for her bigotry", "Because it's unexpected, against social norms for a cis male (gay or not) to wear a dress. Sure, people do it. and more and more are social/ gender norms  being stretched and broken down but still, it's somewhat \"quirky\" by definition.", "That\u2019s pretty quirky to me. Maybe google the definition of quirky.", "The attention should be on the bride and groom, why is that homophobic? If the guy can't act and dress like a grown up to his friends big day then maybe he shouldn't go. I guess OP did say it the wrong way, but calm down man... if he was a homophobe they wouldn't have been friends for so long.", "There's a difference between saying everyone needs to dress formally vs singling out the best friend of your soon-to-be-husband and saying 'you, guy who wears dresses which threatens stupid gender norms, don't come to the wedding unless you wear pants'", "Sure she can. Blaming it on \"anxiety and ADHD\" instead of just owning that you care about the aesthetics of your wedding in pictures and taking whatever flak people want to give you for that is what's silly.", "Then she can put the dress code on the invitation for everyone.", "Is that what she\u2019s doing?", "I wondered if anyone else caught that! Like shouldn\u2019t you be sure sure before you propose?!?", "\u201cYou\u2019re too flamboyant\u201d = \u201cyou\u2019re gayness is annoying and I want to control how you carry yourself\u201d = homophobic.", "Fiance is making OP view his bf differently because she's a homophobe. All these years, going on family vacations, everything is fine but now fiance is probably making small comments about how OPs bffs gay actions make her \"anxiety\" (homophobia) flare up. OP is just a dummy letting a cruel person manipulate him.", "Because she is a homophobe? OP, by extension, is one too obviously.", "Oh, I didn't get all of those meanings. I just figured that OP knew his friend best because with over a year before the wedding he'd already decided that his friend absolutely would upstage OP at his own wedding. I'm glad OP told the world who he is.", "Thats the feeling I get too. Why go full on jerk for no reason ?", "\u201cOh sure, i\u2019ll wear a black tuxedo. I\u2019m also gonna dye my hair neon pink, wear all of my rings and chains, and swap out my septum ring to the biggest, most outlandish bull piercing you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d", "Full goth glam!", "i sincerely hope that you're right about that. i know i tend to take toxic comments like that to heart even when i pretend it's fine, so i really hope that's not the case for taylor.", "\u201cI support the gays but do they really have to flaunt themselves everywhere\u201d (said \u201cgays\u201d are just go for a walk holding hands)\n\n(Sarcasm intended)", "Yeah totally, queer people make me so freaking anxious and it really triggers my attention deficit disorder. I just see a queer person and my brain freezes up! /s", "LOL yes. Even a cheap tux is expensive to rent. A tuxedo is the furthest thing from minimalist", "I'm just confused why she wouldn't use that as an excuse about them both if that's her issue though. Not sure why I'm being downvoted for not understanding \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yeah, I think we are saying the same thing!", "Oh absolutely", "Wearing a dress and/or punk clothing isn't mutually exclusive from \"acting like a grown up\".", "You assume only he was asked to dress appropriately meanwhile if they want a minimalist wedding I'm sure everyone was notified about that but they wanted to make sure about OP's best friend because of his nature. OP approached it in a totally wrong way tho and was unnecessarily hurtful", "We don't know the bride so I don't get why you have the need to give her your diagnose", "I'm pretty sure she did. Idk how to quote on phone but it said she wants a minimalist wedding so I'm pretty sure all guests are notified abouf it", "Hmm. Interesting.", "Because then she\u2019d have to own up to being bigoted.", "Well, i\u2019m not a fan of bridezilla who want to control people\u2019s outfit but being grown up also mean to know when and where you can or can\u2019t wear type of clothes. You don\u2019t wear punk clothes in your office full of white collar..", "In a wedding setting, with a very specific dress code, yes it is.", "You're missing the bigger point here. Even if they reminded everyone else on the list to dress formally, the problem is that OP and his fianc\u00e9 have issues with the fact that Taylor wears dresses. Or, he used to, at least. It's not clear, because OP only mentions one instance from years ago. But, regardless, there is an issue here regarding gender expression and the fact that OP has a problem with a gay man in a dress. The way OP talks about Taylor makes that clear.", "I'm not giving her a diagnosis. I'm arguing that, whether or not she has ADHD and anxiety, those things are not the reason why she wants men to wear tuxedos to her wedding. She wants them to wear tuxedo because she thinks they'll make for better picture in her mind and not take attention away from her. That's fine, but also not the same thing as being unable to function on the day of your wedding unless people are wearing specific things as a result of your mental illness. And as such, she should own that she has those preferences and let the chips fall where they may.", "Then what\u2019s the problem? The friend said he would dress accordingly.", "Having a dress code and asking someone who is known to dress flamboyantly to respect it does not make OP an AH.\n\nThe way he went about asking, by calling \"his closest friend\" a joke and telling him to \"man up\", does, however.", "Why not? I work in an office where people wear pretty non-traditional workwear including men in dresses and punk-adjacent attire. No one says anything about it, it's almost like it's only a big deal if you're offended by it. \n\nBut again, my point here is that Taylor dressing punk or in dresses isn't mutually exclusive from acting grown up. Just because it doesn't jive with OP's dress code doesn't mean it's not grown up.", "He wasn't planning on \"punk\" clothes. He may have been planning on an appropriate black tie evening gown. \n\n\nBilly Porter dresses appropriately for the red carpet at the Oscar's.", "No actually, the \"very specific dress code\" and \"dressing like a grown up\" are too different things.\n\nOP and his fiance are free to have any dress-code they want, including that excludes some of their friends. But when you have a \"very specific dress code\" that includes \"no men in dresses\" and you yell at your friend to \"man up\", you run the risk of alienating that friend and losing the friendship. Not specifically because you asked him to wear a tux to your wedding, but because he was singled out and judged and it was made very clear to him that you and you fiance don't respect him.", "I don't see it like that. It's the same as you expect straight or any woman to not come to a wedding in a white dress to a wedding and if you know someone has a tendancy to do that, you'll try to check did they plan to do it", "> She wants them to wear tuxedo because she thinks they'll make for better picture in her mind and not take attention away from her. \n\nI think it\u2019s even simpler than that: she wants the male-presenting guests in tuxedos because any deviation from the standard male wedding uniform makes her uncomfortable.  She can\u2019t blame that on anxiety or ADHD, either.", "They assumed he wouldn't and all OP needed to do was ask him in a nice way. He definitely went overboard for no reason which makes him TA imo", "I'm guessing OP knows friend well enough to not believe him", "Those aren't even remotely the same things at all, though. No one should wear a white dress because that's general wedding custom, etiquette, whatever you want to call it. Telling men they have to wear suits is giving all the toxic masculinity vibes. You wouldn't tell women that they have to wear dresses would you? It's 2022, get over that gender norm crap.", "This too, for sure.", "General wedding custom is to not upshine the bride. A man in a dress would do that. And no where in the text it says they tried to stop him strictly from wearing a dress, it was just listen as an example. It referred to all flashy clothing from my understanding.", "Again, that's some toxic gender role crap. But at the end of the day all that matters is that OP has shown his friend that he's homophobic and has issues with who he is/how he presents himself. I doubt the friendship is going to recover.", "A man in a dress will only upstage the bride in a room full of homophobes who care about men being in dresses. If OP and his fiance have family and friends who are more about gendered-dressing than they do about celebrating the wedding, that sounds like a them problem, not a Taylor problem.", "I don't understand why are we pretending men wearing dresses is normalized. It really isn't, at least not yet", "Well is he dressing how they feel comfortable presenting themselves, or dressing to make a statement against the dress code? Two very different outcomes and attitudes in those, and the latter can be disruptive."]}
