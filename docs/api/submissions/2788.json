{"id": 2788, "submission_id": "z00ue6", "title": "AITA for shutting down family\u2019s suggestions about parenting - especially about hitting my kids?", "selftext": "\nSo me (26 M) and my girlfriend (24 F) have been together long enough now that the family is asking when we\u2019re going to start thinking about kids. We\u2019re probably a few years off yet because we want to be a bit more secure financially and get married first, but we\u2019ve talked about it a lot and how we want to raise our kids. \n\nMy mum (56) is the oldest of our parents and she is also in the worst health, and is just genuinely eager to be a grandparent, so while she brings it up the most, we don\u2019t mind too much. The biggest problems are my Stepmum (52) and Sister-in-Law (34). \n\nBoth are really opinionated people at the best of times, and yesterday at a family meal the topic of kids came up and we somehow got onto the topic of discipline. Which is when my Stepmum dropped the bombshell that not only does she think hitting your kids is perfectly fine, but that I will do it. \n\nNow I don\u2019t know where she\u2019s got this idea from, because as a kid who was pretty regularly beat by my mum, I am thoroughly against it. I never want my kids to fear me or dread coming home because there\u2019ll be a belt waiting for them.\n\nShe goes onto say about how it\u2019s the only thing that works sometimes and that it didn\u2019t do her or my stepbrother any harm, which is a lie because everyone around that dinner table has been to or needs therapy, and getting hit as a kid probably didn\u2019t help. \n\nNow I work in education, so dealing with behaviour (I am a behaviour lead in my school as well as a teacher) without hitting kids is probably 40% of my job. My girlfriend also works in education. So I think we can keep our cool and manage not to hit our kids out of frustration, so why would we choose to do it? \n\nI told her under no circumstances would I hit my child. I explained that I would reason with them why their behaviour wasn\u2019t acceptable and follow that up another tactic such as removing privileges if that didn\u2019t work. When my SiL asked what if they were too young to understand reason, I pointed out that in that case they were probably too young to understand why you\u2019re hitting them. \n\nThen things got a little messy. My Stepmum did the \u2018under my roof, my rules\u2019 spiel, implying she would hit my kids if they misbehaved, which really got my back up. So I said \u2018Anyone who I trust to look after my kids hurts them, I\u2019ll do the same thing to them, 10x harder\u2019 which didn\u2019t go down well. \n\nWhen she responded that she wouldn\u2019t look after them then, I said that was fine, it\u2019ll just add more grandchildren to the list of ones she isn\u2019t allowed to see which was a bit harsh (but I think justified) considering my brother\u2019s ex won\u2019t let her see their daughter. At that point my dad changed the topic of conversation, but it left a bit of a cloud over the evening. \n\nTLDR: AITA for standing my ground on how I want to raise my future kids and pointing out consequences for anyone who tried to punish them physically?", "created_utc": 1668940215, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z00ue6/aita_for_shutting_down_familys_suggestions_about/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But please don't leave her unsupervised with any future child, I doubt she'll remember this conversation if the kid does something she doesn't like.", "NTA. Your kid, your rules. She also threatened to physically harm your child and you shut that down. I\u2019d be livid about that and withhold her privileges to see them too.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA. Be proud of yourself for standing your ground. Your reaction is totally justified--I would be angry too. Wouldn't trust someone like that to be around my kids alone tbh", "Of course you're NTA. Sorry to hear about your upbringing but glad it won't filter down to your own children when they arrive.", "NTA.\n\nkeep your future children away from these people, under no circumstances should step mum and sil (or anyone who agrees with them) be left alone with the kids!", "NTA. If you advocate loudly for hittung children, you didn't \"turn out fine.\"", "NTA.  I\u2019ll never understand these people who insist that being hit didn\u2019t harm them.  Hitting kids teaches them that violence is an acceptable response to anger or frustration and a good problem solving tool.  The folks I\u2019ve known who have or had issues with getting physical beyond kindergarten were all hit as kids.  Violence begets violence, with stunning predictability.", "NTA. I was also physically abused my my mother and lived in constant fear, it\u2019s the reason I refuse to have kids. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s their house their rules, it\u2019ll still be your child. I would let them know that if they were to lay a finger on your child you would have no hesitation in filing a police report and restricting their access through the courts, tell them you\u2019d be willing to take out a restraining order if it came down to it. If a child is too young to understand reasoning they\u2019re certainly too young to process why they\u2019re being hit by an ADULT. Don\u2019t feel bad about the type of parent you want to be and for standing your ground on these issues, you sound like you\u2019ll be an amazing father.", "NTA \n\nIt's justified to limit access to kids if she can't be trusted around them. And it's totally fine to tell her everyone that tries to do that to kids will get the same just 10 times as hard. \nIf she doesn't think it's okay to be disciplined by physical violence as an adult, she should be able to understand why it's just as wrong doing so to a kid.", "NTA. Your priority as a parent is protecting your kids (even the hypothetical ones.) You now know where those relatives stand on what they believe is acceptable with a vulnerable child. And they now know that you do not find their ideas acceptable. \n\nHonestly? If I had kids, I would not allow them near anyone who thought hitting a kid is a good way to discipline them. It does far more harm, than good. It\u2019s not worth the long term affects on the child\u2019s self esteem, their body autonomy, your relationship with them, etc.\n\nAs a child who was spanked by my mother, it really did nothing to stop my behaviour\u2026. I just became sneaky and secretive. It did stop me from communicating with her, and our relationship is distant. We talk, but it\u2019s not meaningful, because I don\u2019t feel as though I can trust her.\n\nNTA. You\u2019ll be a good dad, when the time comes.", "INFO This is an argument about disciplining imaginary children?", "Bloody hell, not only on at you about kids but also how she would discipline them if they were in her care....terrible behaviour. NTA at all. When you have kids, how you raise them, who you visit is down to you and your partner. I don't blame you for what you said, they noth sound very hard work and quite unpleasant.  You can have strong opinions without being overbearing, rude and interfering.\nHave to say I'd be distancing myself from them and even more do if I was pregnant", "Nope nope nope NTA. I'm sure you know about the body of research around corporal punishment. Stand your ground. At least you know now who to not send your kids to.", "NTA\n\nGood for you\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nI'm 55 yrs of age. I have never hit my children. They are respectful, lovely young adults. \n\nStay your course and don't let ANY of those grandparents look after your children unless you trust them 100%\n\nA few home truths never hurt anyone. Especially not when it comes to assaulting children. Because thats what hitting children is. Assault. If people did what they do to children to adults?  They'd be arrested and charged with assault.

I knew a guy with your stepmoms mentality, though he believed it was because the Bible said, etc.", "JFC you are so NTA.", "NTA. There is no reason why you should think that you are", "NTA\n\nThank you for stopping the cycle of abuse. Kids should be disciplined but not beaten, and if they're too young to know reason their def too young for a spanking. Op, the important thing is if your kid does something wrong you correct their behavior. This could be taking privileges, making them apologize, giving them a lecture, giving them an extra chore, community service....\n\nYou weren't too harsh with what you said. Now you know who you can and can't let watch your kids.", "INFO: is hitting children not against the law where you live?\n\nApart from that: obviously very good that you are adamant about this. And yes, don\u2019t let them near your hypothetical future kids, what is wrong with them?", "NTA-  you were protecting them against the promise of abuse which you\u2019ve had to do before they even exist.  Who can blame you?", "NTA but also I'd avoid these conversations and shut down discussions about you two having kids, as it will make people like your stepmother think they have a say in anything you do regarding parenting. Set the boundaries now in terms of what you will discuss with them unless you want to deal with nonsense like them visiting as soon as the baby is born or interfering in other decisions.", "NTA. Good for you.", "NTA. But spanking is OK for children.", "My dad was quite the believer in harsh physical punishment. My husband\u2019s father was the same way. We promised each other we\u2019d never hit our kids. We stuck to that promise. Our kids are now in their 30\u2019s and both are doing well in life. If somebody can\u2019t discipline a child without physically assaulting them, they shouldn\u2019t be a parent.", "You do realize someone could be violent without being raised violently, right?", "Yup at least 2-3 years from existing.", "Exactly what I was thinking. The children don't even exist and they are already arguing about it.", "Unfortunately in England, smacking your kid is fully legal as long as it is a \u2018reasonable punishment\u2019. Banned in Scotland and Wales though so hopefully it\u2019s not a million miles off here.", "Most cases it stems from somewhere. Almost all serial killers had abusive childhoods.", "That was my thought, too. It's almost like she's looking forward to the discipline part of being grandma the most. I would never leave my child with her if I were you. That's....creepy af.\n\nNTA. I was spanked (beat). Reasoning and intelligent conversation would have educated me without needlessly breaking my spirit. I was a quiet, joyful, compliant child. There was no need for abuse. Now I deal with crushed self esteem, boundary issues, trust issues and all kinds of other nonsense. It's a fight daily to be courageous about things that others do without thought.\n\nI raised my son without spanking. He is nearly 22, and he has an amazing head on his shoulders. I took the time to talk to him intelligently, even as a toddler. I took time to instill wisdom, rather than fear. If the point of spanking is to teach, then children have to be taught. Consistently. Scaring the hell out of them and physically hurting them instills fear and demands compliance/submission, but how does that help them to think for themselves and make good decisions when their parents are not there? Isn't the point of parenting to work ourselves out of a job? \n\nParenting takes (among other things) love, wisdom, kindness, compassion, patience, devotion, humility, understanding, vulnerability, communication, tenderness, and time. It's not supposed to be 18+ years of bullying and beating children, and then throwing them out while expecting them to \"do you proud\". How? All they know is fear and obedience.\n\nIt sounds like y'all have thought this through very well and you'll be great parents one day-- when you're both ready!", "Not every abused kid grows up to be an asshole or a monster, and tossing out \"most serial killers were abused\" whenever talking about abusive childhoods doesn't help the misconception that abuse victims often become abusers. \n\nSource: not a serial killer, haven't even punched another human in my entire life, despite growing up abused in all the ways."]}
