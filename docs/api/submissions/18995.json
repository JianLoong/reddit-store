It seems like your father is just as tired of it as well.  I wonder if anyone ever spoke to the grandmother about her constant complaining.", "NTA. The dinner was about you, and grandma didn't get it. It seems like your dad is even taking a stand with you, which tells me a lot about this situation. I'd stay with your friend for a little bit, and let mom calm down. Maybe dad will talk some sense into her, but time is obviously needed here.", "ESH except for your dad. You shouldn't have said what you did in front of your grandparents. Your grandmother shouldn't have made an occasion that should've been celebrating your achievements about her. Your mother shouldn't have railroaded your concerns in the first place. She talked about respect but they showed you none. Your dad is the only good guy here.", "NTA. My mother was like your grandma and it sucked going out with her. We tried to avoid restaurants, but if we couldn\u2019t, we\u2019d apologize to the staff ahead of time and tip very well. Let your mom calm down a bit and talk to her in a few more days/weeks.", "NTA for you except the \"see that why i did not wanted them here\"\n\nThe granny is embarrasing.

You mom might need to think if she would be okay if her or her relatives behave entilted to any dinner ?", "NTA.

Younger siblings shouldn't deal with this bullshit either.", "NTA\n\nIt's always annoying to eat out with entitled diners. You went there for a good time but ended up hearing someone complain the whole time. I don't blame you for leaving.", "NTA - hard part of being a kid is you are stuck in a situation. You have nowhere to go.   \n\nYour fads probably sick of your mom and grandma's attitude as well. In this situation- he could step up even more. I'd have a talk with him about wanting to be comfortable in your own home and ask him to do something about it.  He is choosing to just let you go and stay status quo. (I have a kid your age and am saying it from my perspective). In this situation I blame your dad more than anyone. As he probably sees the truth", "NTA your grandma is a narcissist and your mom is either an enabler or a narcissist too. I think you dad is just as over the situation as you.
