I hope you can find a way to make up with her before you go.", "Let's get to basics. It was Gran who ruined things not OP. If she'd behaved all would have been well. Is she getting the blame from mom? No", "YTA - families have weird quirks. Cutting someone out bc they are high maintenance at restaurants \u2014 before you\u2019ve ever even talked to them about it - is absurd. \n\nCongrats on your graduation - now go home.", "NTA!\n\nI\u2019m sorry you got in trouble for calling it like it is, but I am very glad you\u2019re being supported by your dad. Family can be sooo awful sometimes. I am glad you are getting out of there soon!", "NTA\n\nYour grandma is a joke. I\u2019m sorry you have to go through this.", "Nta. Is good that your dad understands you. I recently had my graduation and the day of my ceremony,my mom became like a little girl, in spanish berrinchuda.  She called my grandma and told her about how expensive my dress was and yeah first time ever on an expensive dress bc I wanted to be special, but she said it in a tone like \"IT WAS SOOOO EXPENSIVE, GUESS HOW MUCH\"Then I told her she shouldn't say stiff like that expressing how exp3nsive it was, and told her all my aunts are gonna know about it and talk about it, like gossip. She then started tearing up saying I called her a gossip girl, I didn't say to her but her sister, like!?!? In the end, she didn't give me a hug for graduating and didn't come eat with us. I think it was peaceful without her there, now we are in no speaking terms, only talk to her when I have to.", "This reminds me of my paternal grandmother. She is also a pain in the arse when it comes to eating out. When we go to a Mexican restaurant she wants to totally redo the ingredients for her meal like replacing the corn tortilla with a flour one even when the waitress says no substitutions. She will quite literally make a scene. And when it's time to leave she will ask for a doggie bag for the chips and salsa. By that time we are thoroughly embarrassed \ud83d\ude14 by this behavior. So my parents refuse to take her out to places we frequently eat at because it's so bad. \n\nOP you are NTA. I can totally relate.", "Bready?! The eff is that.\n\nNTA", "Grandma's issue was that she wasn't the center of attention \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42", "It just seemed like she was looking for something to complain about. No matter what the waitstaff did she would always find an issue with it.", "If you're looking for other suggestions, English Muffins make great burger buns.", "Yes.  I don't f*** with anyone who is handling my food.", "Honestly, even sending food back for something minor is tolerable if they're at least polite about it. I usually don't, but an \"I'm sorry, this is overcooked/undercooked/has an ingredient I asked for without\" is at least respectful. The grandma was not respectful, even a little bit.", ">You shouldn't have said what you did in front of your grandparents\n\nI'm curious: why not?", "Nope. NTA.", "The patty was too meaty, as well!  \n\nDon't get me started on the onions!", "Indeed. And this is why reasonable people ask questions like \"What type of bun is the burger served in?\" before ordering the damn meal. But grandma is not even slightly reasonable, evidently.", "[removed]", "Yup.

That ... doesn't sound great.", "Why doesn\u2019t your mum tell the waiter before not to put lemon to avoid the whole fiasco and complaining", "That's not a hate of lemon. That's a love of complaining/anger", "My partner also hates lemon. So he always tells the server he doesn't want it when he's ordering. Your mother sounds like a trial :(", "There's actually a lot of research about how full of bacteria those lemon wedges usually are.  So that's actually a very good thing to not get them.", "The burger was also too burger-y.", "Even if someone is a dyed in the wool asshole, not pissing off the people handling your food is just smart.", "Yippie guilt trip time!", "Don't forget the water!
