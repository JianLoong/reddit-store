Is good that your dad understands you. I recently had my graduation and the day of my ceremony,my mom became like a little girl, in spanish berrinchuda.  She called my grandma and told her about how expensive my dress was and yeah first time ever on an expensive dress bc I wanted to be special, but she said it in a tone like \"IT WAS SOOOO EXPENSIVE, GUESS HOW MUCH\"Then I told her she shouldn't say stiff like that expressing how exp3nsive it was, and told her all my aunts are gonna know about it and talk about it, like gossip. She then started tearing up saying I called her a gossip girl, I didn't say to her but her sister, like!?!? In the end, she didn't give me a hug for graduating and didn't come eat with us. I think it was peaceful without her there, now we are in no speaking terms, only talk to her when I have to.", "This reminds me of my paternal grandmother. She is also a pain in the arse when it comes to eating out. When we go to a Mexican restaurant she wants to totally redo the ingredients for her meal like replacing the corn tortilla with a flour one even when the waitress says no substitutions. She will quite literally make a scene. And when it's time to leave she will ask for a doggie bag for the chips and salsa. By that time we are thoroughly embarrassed \ud83d\ude14 by this behavior.

She surveys us and the room and decides what problem she wants to create.

This was your day and they made it all about them. Looks like your dad has your back and your mom is heading the same way as your grandma. Your dad seems as though he's had to put up with their crap for so long and is really tired of it know. Don't be surprised if they split up. Your dad is a good man", "NTA it seems the Apple doesn\u2019t fall too far from the tree with your mom and grandma", "NTA, it's not an \"attitude problem\" if you disagree with your family members or if you call out their poor behaviour. I had a similar situation so I can tell you what worked for me, ymmv bc every parental relationship is unique. \n\nIf you want to continue interacting with them, I would suggest that when you have a problem with what they are doing, that you make an effort to phrase your problems in as neutral a way as possible. Instead of \"this is exactly why I didn't want to come,\" you could say \"you are being rude to the wait staff - it is embarassing me and i'm not having fun at a dinner that is supposed to be about me.\" I know it's hard\nto talk this way to your parents and not every relationship permits it, but directness can be a powerful and shocking tool in these situations. And it's hard to argue against someone saying they aren't having a good time.\n\nRegarding the neutral present/tense phrasing vs calling back to previous conversations - this takes out any historical element - ie: remembering past disagreements on the subject can make people get emotional. It's also useful to define what the problematic behaviour is and why it is a problem for you. \n\nDirectness is a learned skill, so it's okay to do a bit of prep for these sorts of conversations jf yiu expect them to come up . For example, If you expect that they will play dumb - \"how are we being rude?\" - you can prepare a follow-up answer like \"restaurants have menus for a reason. if you don't like what is on the menu, why would you go there.\" I'm sure that you can come up with something better but you get the idea. \n\nAlso, get in the habit of shutting down attempts to invalidate how you feel. If they say you're being unreasonable or difficult, either ignore and don't address those sorts of comments or just flatly shut them down and don't validate them by arguing against them eg: \"I'm not being unreasonable,\". It doesn't matter if they think you're being unreasonable - they are making you uncomfortable and if they care about your well being, they should stop.\n\nFrom the vibe of your post, I'm going to assume that you don't want to go no contact with your mom. But also that the current relationship you have with her isn't working for you. You need her to see you as an a adult and to take the issues that you raise seriously. \n\nIt's slightly machiavellian, but if you want to readjust the relationship with your mom, consider that you do have a bit of leverage now because she wants your graduation party to happen. She's used to telling you what to do, in order to get what she wants, but that's not working any more. So, if you show her that she can get what she wants more easily by working with you than against you, then she might come down a bit from her high and mighty perch.\n\nBut that's up to you - if this was the final straw for you, fair enough. But if there is some olive branch that you would accept, it could be a good time to ask for it? If I were you, what I would really want here is for my mom to just agree that the grandparents were being rude byt also disrespectful. Your mom told you to come to the dinner because it would be disrespectful not to. Weren't your grandparents also being disrespectful by making a scene at the restaurant and making you feel uncomfortable at a party for you?\n\nI'm projecting my own experiences too much here. You have to decide what is right for you and that may require a bit of reflection. If you do want a relationship with ber though, put some real thought into what you want out of it. Decide what your red lines are going to be and challenge her politely but firmly if she crosses them. But also decide what you're willing to let go - things don't change overnight and you may have to accept some behaviours while she works on other ones.\n\nGood luck and keep advocating for yourself and doing whatever you need to do to stay mentally healthy.", "NTA I'm glad you have a friend to stay with and that your dad is supportive.

I do hope you and your mom can have an open conversation about it soon though, because this sounds tough.\n\nMy mother-in-law was like that. It was endlessly painful to even have a coffee with her somewhere.
