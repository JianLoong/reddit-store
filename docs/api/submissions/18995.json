Definitely NTA.", "Congratulations on your graduation!", "Hey, you're not the asshole, but as someone who spent some time homeless and couch surfing, I wanted to give you some advice as someone who has been there and done that. The best way to maintain a safe temporary place to live is to be a good guest, and you demonstrate good guest behavior by going above and beyond what you would normally do in your own home. Take over as many household chores as it is possible for you to do, and that means not only the physical task of the chore, but also the emotional labor of deciding when and how often those chores need to be done (more often than you would do in your own home), and in the discipline of doing those chores consistently without being asked, and also in purchasing the supplies to perform the cleaning tasks. \n\nAsk your hosts if they have a preference on cleaning products, and if not, 5% strength vinegar (it's either on the baking aisle or the cleaning aisle with the ammonia-the bigger ones on the baking aisle are cheaper by oz.) in a spray bottle (these can usually be found by the mops) undiluted with a squirt of dish soap will clean 90% of surfaces in a house. The only separate cleaner I use is shower cleaner, and honestly, I could probably get away with using the vinegar and dish soap combo with a magic eraser. You can use washcloths or dish towels, which can be laundered and reused, to clean all surfaces in a house except for the toilets. Always use paper towels for that job.\n\n  \n\n\nIf you haven't ever been in charge of chores before, I'd recommend the following schedule:\n\nVacuum the entire house every 3 days if carpeted. Sweep uncarpeted areas of the house daily, and mop once weekly. \n\nWipe down kitchen, living area, and bathroom counters daily.\n\nEnsure all dishes are washed and put away by the end of day, daily.\n\nClean the toilets every 3 days.\n\nClean the showers once weekly. Magic erasers are your friend, but don't use them on glass!\n\nTake note of when the trash cans are filling, and empty them when they're 3/4 full. Replace the trash bags afterwards.\n\nWash your own bedsheets and bath towel and those of your friend (if he's comfortable with that) once weekly. Purchase a laundry hamper (not basket!) with a lid and wash your laundry once a week or whenever the hamper is full, whichever comes first.\n\nMake the bed you're sleeping in daily, and keep the area you're staying in tidy and visually appealing to look at. Throw away any trash immediately, and don't allow your possessions to clutter the space unnecessarily. Ensure your clothes are folded and clean and that you shower and brush and floss your teeth daily. I don't mean to be condescending with the dental advice- I was in a deep depression at your age and neglected my own dental health leading to expensive and entirely preventable consequences down the line. If you neglect everything else about your body (and you shouldn't) always always brush and floss your teeth every day.\n\nAnd most importantly! Tell your friends parents that you would like to contribute to the house bills during the time you're staying there, and to please give you a fair percentage to pay, if you're working and are able to do this. If you're not, check out level 2 security jobs. They have a very low barrier to entry, are pretty easy jobs that leave a lot of downtime for a student to study, and pay well. Don't be put off by the licensing requirements; your employer will either pay get you licensed when you start, or you'll have to pay ~ $40 to your state to read a booklet and take a multiple choice test online.\n\nIf you can swing it financially, feed the family you're staying with a few times a month. You can make large meals for cheap at home; lots of recipes can be googled. It doesn't have to be elaborate: spaghetti and meatballs or beans and rice fill you up and taste as good as something fancy and you can dress them up in a thousand different ways. \n\n \n\nThis was a lot but hopefully any of it helps. Good luck to you, and hold fast to your boundaries. You deserve to surround yourself with people who treat you well and with respect. You always have. Every relationship that ends frees up time and space for new relationships with people who are compatible with you and who won't act like toddlers in restaurants.", "YTA, but we all have moments like that. Apologize and make it right with your grandparents.", "NTA  \n\n\nCan't even begin to understand what it is like to go through this sort of embarrassment all your life.

This was your day and they made it all about them. Looks like your dad has your back and your mom is heading the same way as your grandma. Your dad seems as though he's had to put up with their crap for so long and is really tired of it know. Don't be surprised if they split up. Your dad is a good man", "NTA it seems the Apple doesn\u2019t fall too far from the tree with your mom and grandma", "NTA, it's not an \"attitude problem\" if you disagree with your family members or if you call out their poor behaviour. I had a similar situation so I can tell you what worked for me, ymmv bc every parental relationship is unique. \n\nIf you want to continue interacting with them, I would suggest that when you have a problem with what they are doing, that you make an effort to phrase your problems in as neutral a way as possible. Instead of \"this is exactly why I didn't want to come,\" you could say \"you are being rude to the wait staff - it is embarassing me and i'm not having fun at a dinner that is supposed to be about me.\" I know it's hard\nto talk this way to your parents and not every relationship permits it, but directness can be a powerful and shocking tool in these situations. And it's hard to argue against someone saying they aren't having a good time.\n\nRegarding the neutral present/tense phrasing vs calling back to previous conversations - this takes out any historical element - ie: remembering past disagreements on the subject can make people get emotional. It's also useful to define what the problematic behaviour is and why it is a problem for you. \n\nDirectness is a learned skill, so it's okay to do a bit of prep for these sorts of conversations jf yiu expect them to come up . For example, If you expect that they will play dumb - \"how are we being rude?\" - you can prepare a follow-up answer like \"restaurants have menus for a reason. if you don't like what is on the menu, why would you go there.\" I'm sure that you can come up with something better but you get the idea. \n\nAlso, get in the habit of shutting down attempts to invalidate how you feel. If they say you're being unreasonable or difficult, either ignore and don't address those sorts of comments or just flatly shut them down and don't validate them by arguing against them eg: \"I'm not being unreasonable,\". It doesn't matter if they think you're being unreasonable - they are making you uncomfortable and if they care about your well being, they should stop.\n\nFrom the vibe of your post, I'm going to assume that you don't want to go no contact with your mom. But also that the current relationship you have with her isn't working for you. You need her to see you as an a adult and to take the issues that you raise seriously. \n\nIt's slightly machiavellian, but if you want to readjust the relationship with your mom, consider that you do have a bit of leverage now because she wants your graduation party to happen. She's used to telling you what to do, in order to get what she wants, but that's not working any more. So, if you show her that she can get what she wants more easily by working with you than against you, then she might come down a bit from her high and mighty perch.\n\nBut that's up to you - if this was the final straw for you, fair enough. But if there is some olive branch that you would accept, it could be a good time to ask for it? If I were you, what I would really want here is for my mom to just agree that the grandparents were being rude byt also disrespectful. Your mom told you to come to the dinner because it would be disrespectful not to. Weren't your grandparents also being disrespectful by making a scene at the restaurant and making you feel uncomfortable at a party for you?\n\nI'm projecting my own experiences too much here. You have to decide what is right for you and that may require a bit of reflection. If you do want a relationship with ber though, put some real thought into what you want out of it. Decide what your red lines are going to be and challenge her politely but firmly if she crosses them. But also decide what you're willing to let go - things don't change overnight and you may have to accept some behaviours while she works on other ones.\n\nGood luck and keep advocating for yourself and doing whatever you need to do to stay mentally healthy.", "NTA I'm glad you have a friend to stay with and that your dad is supportive.
