{"id": 25918, "submission_id": "165zdu9", "title": "AITA for not going to my best friend\u2019s wedding?", "selftext": "Throwaway\nWelcome to my nightmare. \n\nI (F,26) was in a three year long relationship. We were engaged for 8 months but in February, I found out he was cheating on me. I ended things immediately and had to start picking up the pieces from not only my life, but the wedding plans we had started to set. Nothing much was set in stone but we did have a date and I did have a dress. It was a dress that I had wanted for YEARS and when I got engaged I almost immediately bought it.\nClearly devastated, I have been a wreck the last few months. Everything from my body to my mind started to rapidly decline and I relied heavily on my family and friends to keep me afloat. One of my best friends in particular, we\u2019ll call her Kelly (F,26) was a huge support system to me. She would come over to sit with me and just help me be a regular person again. She helped remove any trace of him from my apartment and even volunteered to hold my dress in the meantime so I wouldn\u2019t have to look at it, which at the time seemed like a great idea. It would be out of sight but eventually there again if I wanted it or decided to sell it. \nAll while this is happening, Kelly is also planning her wedding which was set for last Saturday, the 26th of August. She reluctantly talked about her wedding in front of me, which I thought was to spare my fragile feelings. Boy I was fucking wrong. \nI had mustered up my strength to agree to go to the wedding. I didn\u2019t want to be in the bridal\nparty, which she was completely okay with and suggested. (again I chalked it up to her being supportive of my state) I had gotten a new dress and was excited to get out and have fun for the first time in a while. The morning of the wedding, one of the bridesmaids (who I am friends with) had texted me saying how excited she was to see me and how sweet it was for me to loan my dress to Kelly.\nI was confused. It didn\u2019t even register in my mind but once I had reread the text for the 1000th time things started to click. I immediately called Kelly and she launched into a sob saying she was sorry, how she loved the dress so much, and how it was too late for her to get another one. I just hung up having absolutely nothing to say. I was floored. \nI immediately texted her saying I would bill her for the dress (as it was the only thing my scrambled mind could think to) and in turn got a whole slew of messages saying how if I wasn\u2019t using the dress anymore, it shouldn\u2019t matter if she does. Some of the bridesmaids were on my side but her closer friends and her mother, thought I was being unreasonable. When I didn\u2019t show up for the wedding, it only escalated. Called me selfish, a terrible friend, along with many other names. Saying how if she was there for me, I should\u2019ve been there for her.\nPlease help. AITA for being mad about the dress? Even if there was a chance I would sell it? Or am I justified in being upset since now the dress can no longer be mine.", "created_utc": 1693451456, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165zdu9/aita_for_not_going_to_my_best_friends_wedding/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
