He told her off for calling me \"the devil\" and said that if I can't wear a hat, he's not coming either, and that she really should get over her antiquated BS. She did not respond well.

You treat me poorly, try to harm my marriage, and say nasty and spiteful things about me. In order for this to work, you need to treat me like the family that I am. Because at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t bother me if you and I don\u2019t have a relationship. Your words don\u2019t hurt me, but they hurt your son. The only thing you are accomplishing with your behavior is harming the relationship you have with your son. And this is the part that bothers me, say whatever you want about me and I won\u2019t care, but when you cause that kind of pain to my husband, I will not tolerate that at any level.

By the time I did, my mother was so bad in how she acted; I already created a distance between me and her. She would visit my sister who's apartment was 5 doors down, even stay the night.

But he needs to have a relationship with her.\n\nMy wife tried to get me to do so. But I couldn't.  With the distance I made being passive aggressive into the addition of how my mother acted; I lost time with my mom. And made major pain. My mom passed in the end of Aug. this year.

But outside drama with my siblings; I did not want to visit her to avoid a chance to seeing them. \n\nThen a month and a half later her will was read. She cut me out. Gave everything but one piece of furniture that I did not want or ever had any ties to. She cut my, and my kids out of her estate. And in that action; also my father's. My story is what it is. And you and your husband is unique as well. And he should support you. But in time I hope he will at least be willing to have a relationship with her. You will maybe have kids one day. And that will make a even harder emotional and mental stress to shoulder if the current situation is not worked out in time.\n\nYour husband is going through a VERY emotional and painful mentally situation.

She got a raw deal, but if she can somehow prove to herself that her children still need her, that she's still the center of their lives the way they've been the center of hers for decades, then it won't all have been a waste.

This is a situation where the first step towards reconcilation needs to come from the MIL otherwise its meaningless. MIL is toxic and just telling her to stop being toxic didnt work. So unless you are into torturing yourself with another shitty christmas there needs to come some kind of action from the MIL that indicates she will at least be civil for christmas.  \nAsking her to make some stupid concession is that thing. If she is willing to make that concession its showing some minimal goodwill and an attempt to reconcile. At that point you can show up for christmas without the hat and maybe everybody can have a civil christmas.  \nIf MIL isnt even willing to make such a small concession she also wont be playing nice for christmas so you should just avoid going there altogether. \n\nThe hat is just a meaningless thing to see if MIL is going to be toxic and the result has been delivered.", "I'd take the authenticity over the peace any old day.\n\nI gotta say OP is NTA and she's very fortunate that she's married a husband who is willing to stand up to his mom for her.

OP just requested that she be accepted the way she is, and she used the means that she just had at hand. In this case, the hat. It was more a symbol than anything else.\n\nAnd family declining you being around because of what you wear? Can we point at how ridiculous that is in the first place?\n\nEdit: If it makes OP feel any better: I'm down that road 5 years now and my MIL has somewhat gotten used to me by now. I even got a christmas present this year. :) Stay strong lady, they calm down.", "So according to you OP should be the one trying to make peace with someone who doesn't want peace and is looking for every excuse under the stars to make op look like the idiot.

I don't make concessions about what I choose to do with my body for anyone. First of all what an awful precedent to set. My ex-MIL was a nightmare enough and if theres one thing I learned is that, conceding to these types of people does not send the message you think it does. You think you're compromising and that she will see that and compromise back. She sees it as having won, 'Good, all I have to do is throw a fit and she will change herself to fit my demands'. Trust me, I've gone through it before, the apologizing, the 'I just want (ex) to be happy', the 'well its just this one thing'. It's never just that one thing. It is NOT about her being uptight and mellowing out, OP was very clear that MIL has never liked her. The hat wasn't the problem, the marriage is. Now that MIL feels like she's \"stuck\" with OP she will do anything she can to antagonize them. If they conceded to this it would give exactly MIL what she wants, control over her son and further control over his relationship.

She has to have it made very clear that this will not be tolerated, not even slightly. Drawing a strong boundary and enforcing it will get them to a neutral spot a lot faster than giving in to things like not wearing a hat. Otherwise they will be teaching MIL that if she has a fit the next time they get together whatever the fit was about is now the rule. That will never work.
