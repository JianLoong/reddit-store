At Thanksgiving, I was having a really bad hair day so I wore a black leather cap (a dressier newsboy-style one), which my husband said looked great on me. The holiday was hostile, even more so than prior gatherings I'd been to, and hubby said MIL said it was because I wore a hat, but I know it was just an excuse.

Hubby said he thought I\u2019d worn it since I had a bad hair day, but this time it\u2019s as a statement that they shouldn\u2019t treat me as an outsider, either because I wear hats all the time (right now it\u2019s just a sports visor, which I\u2019d never wear to a holiday, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing that) or they just don\u2019t like me.

He spent last night at a friend\u2019s house because he needed to think. I feel bad because I care about him and know conflict stresses him out. I told him to text me when he was ready to talk.

He told her off for calling me \"the devil\" and said that if I can't wear a hat, he's not coming either, and that she really should get over her antiquated BS. She did not respond well.

Even if she thought the hat was rude, a true manners/etiquette maven would NEVER let you know it. \n\nYour MIL is looking for ways to make you uncomfortable and singled out--you are right not to let her.

You treat me poorly, try to harm my marriage, and say nasty and spiteful things about me. In order for this to work, you need to treat me like the family that I am. Because at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t bother me if you and I don\u2019t have a relationship. Your words don\u2019t hurt me, but they hurt your son. The only thing you are accomplishing with your behavior is harming the relationship you have with your son. And this is the part that bothers me, say whatever you want about me and I won\u2019t care, but when you cause that kind of pain to my husband, I will not tolerate that at any level.

I certainly do on bad hair days.", "I think that went by the wayside for men with baseball caps, except church.", "My grandfather wears his hat all the time ever since I was a kid. He has never been asked to remove it in front of me at least.", "I\u2019m in the US and yes men used to remove hats inside, not so much so since the advent of the baseball cap. Never heard of a woman needing to remove her hat; if I\u2019m having a bad hair day that hats plastered to my head lol\nI\u2019m in Pennsylvania", "I agree, and Emily Post would also agree. It's just childish of her to put her husband in the position of having to choose a side.", "I guess I'm looking at this as something she can do for her husband. Why drag him into the middle of something so petty? She should pick her battles. If she has his back this time (doesn't wear a hat), then he's more likely to have her back next time she needs him to back her up.", "A newsboys hat is a men's hat. It's a news**boys** hat. It's now worn by women too, but it's traditionally a man's hat, just like baseball caps.", "And just because people have confirmation bias doesn't mean they're in the majority.", "Not how I've read it.", "We do lots of things as humans living in a society \"just because\" they're rules. Why do service staff greet people with \"how are you\" when we all know the answer is just going to be \"good\" or \"fine thanks\", regardless of anyones actual wellbeing? Why do we eat with knives and forks in the hands we do? Why do waiters wear funny little bow ties at fancy restaurants?\n\nHats used to serve a functional outdoor purpose. In a world before sunscreen and sunglasses, hats were a necessary piece of protective outdoor clothing. That division between indoor and outdoor equipment/clothing may not be so prominent these days, but the symbolism obviously remains for some people regarding taking them off indoors.\n\nThat might seem stupid to you, but humans hang on to lots of kinda silly customs due to historical hangups.", "Oh sorry, I don\u2019t have an explanation about when this rule was put into place haha. I just was taught growing up you didn\u2019t wear hats at the dinner table. Sorry, wish I had more insight to give you!!!", "Yes because hats have genders /s", "That\u2019s true. If you\u2019d like to design a really good survey and find out for sure, have at it.", "No worries!"]}
