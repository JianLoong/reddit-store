Sorry I don\u2019t get it", "I'll probably get downvoted for this - but here goes. \n\nI love taking photos - especially of people. So much so that I minored in Art with a concentration in Photography. As a teen, then all through college and my early 20's, I would ask my bf, later fiance and friends and family if I could photograph them. When I was 14 my Father had given me a really nice Minolta. I also had a few inexpensive cameras. So - I kept a camera near me at all times. Just sitting around the apartment, I'd see my bf looking cute or sexy or funny and I'd just pick up my camera and snap a photo. Those photos were always the best, most authentic photos. I loved them. He loved them.  And people always seemed to comment the most about these photos. I framed a lot of photos and placed them around the apartment, had a lot of photo albums too. Conversely, the photos ones where he was all polished and poised never elicited the same warm feelings or comments from others.   \nI understand where you're coming from, but I feel like I would be a bit hurt / bothered if I grabbed my camera to snap a pic of my SO and he began to dictate how the photo should be taken. Sometimes candid, relaxed photos are genuinely beautiful. Later, when digital became the rage, It took me a LOOOONG time to get used to shooting with a digital camera because people would always want you stop and let you see every single photo. It actually made me fall a little bit out of love with photography. \n\nAnyway - \n\nMost people are ***with*** people that they're attracted to ... people they find beautiful. So it's odd to think of someone DELIBERATELY trying to take a bad photo of someone they love. \n\nI think if you're really bothered by certain angles, you have to learn the angles that work best for you, then make sure you always position yourself that way in relation to the camera / photographer. It takes practice, but it's definitely a skill that can be learned. *I hate being photographed, so I never learned this skill, but I know people that are excellent with this.* \n\nI can't vote on OP a-hole status because I need more info. If he snaps photos and she's given him the ok to snap photos randomly - and the photos are just for the 2 of them, then I don't think he's the AH. What would make him the AH is if he's taking photos and laughing at his gf ... and she never likes any of the photos / never finds them funny and has asked him to stop taking photos and he continues to do so. \n\nLike a few others have said, I suspect the gf is self-conscious about her weight and it's messing with her self-esteem and making her uber-critical of her own appearance.", "INFO: You need to give more context.\n\nWhen you say you are laughing, what are you laughing at? The thing happening in the moment? The way she looks (even if you\u2019re doing it because it\u2019s cute)? Something else?\n\nIf you\u2019re laughing at how \u201ccute\u201d she looks, she may easily misinterpret that as just laughing at her appearance. If she has an insecurity, you could easily be making it worse.", "NTA", "INFO: I feel the key thing here is deciding whether you care more about how your girlfriend feels or whether you want to be right/continue doing what you want which you perceive as harmless. In this situation, do you care more about your girlfriend or yourself?\n\nIf you care more about how she feels, it\u2019d be simple really.
