You are not obligated to keep the name your parents gave you, for any reason. If your family can't accept that you're more comfortable going by something else, then it's their problem, not yours.

Not because I claim some ownership over his name, having chosen it myself when he was born. But more because *it's a big deal*.\n\nNames are important. They're a big part of your identity. And not being privvy to that, as a parent, to your child's identity is very upsetting.\n\nThat being said, I still say NTA, because at the end of the day it's *your* name.

You don't want to be even remotely close to associating with your bio parents, but I can see how they would be hurt too.

The adopted parents think you betrayed your adopted parents by changing from the name your birth parents gave you? Or the adopted parents think you are betraying the birth parents? Either way, spins my head a bit. Sounds like your parents were the A and you don't want the connection, I don't really see the problem there. If there isn't more to this story this is weird to me.

Them waving your relationship goodbye over you changing your name makes their parental qualities highly questionable, but it is still within their rights to do.\n\nThis is a shitty situation to get to, but my only honest opinion I can give you is that if they were willing to drop you over something so inconsequential as change of name, perhaps they were not the kind of people you'd want to keep in your life anyway.

Some parents they are.", "First names don\u2019t usually get changed with adoptions, only last names.", "Ah, spelling change. This is info I didn't get in our thread. It could be possible the issue for them is they changed the spelling to own the name and let you own the name by proxy. I can start to see their side perhaps.

Have you thought about writing them a letter, gracefully explaining your intent and how they made you feel?  I say gracefully because sometimes getting anger involved right away nullifies points made sometimes. This way you can get your feelings across without angry interruptions from them(in face to face communication) and call them the next day to see if they understand where you're coming from?", "You may just need to sit down with them and try and have a calm and rational conversation all around and get to the nut of this. If you are straight forward and not emotional in explaining your feelings on this, they should be more than able to accept that, especially since they didn't name you, but it's going to be important to ask them questions and understand their side so you all can figure this out and move on healthily.", "I meant why would they feel betrayed if they werent even the ones to name you in the first place?

Your adoptive parents didn't change the name the abusive parents gave you, but they still feel connection and got upset when you changed it? Why? \n\nIn any case NTA.

I'll never understand parents that get angry about their kid changing their name, they aren't the ones that have to go by it. There's also literally no excuse for them saying something so cruel to you. If they don't apologize for that, I'd probably go low or no contact if I were you, because that's a pretty appalling lack of care for your feelings.

Their answer is unhinged unless we are missing vital details of the story.", "My trans daughter started that conversation with \u2018what would you have named me if I was born a girl?\u2019 We then spent days discussing it and chose her new name together. Her name is perfect for her, resonating deeply. If you step into the parents shoes it\u2019s not narcissistic (do you mean self-centered there?) it\u2019s coping with massive changes to their world that can feel like loss -of future vision, surety they know their own child, solidity. Even loving your child and supporting them fiercely there is an element of loss that you as a supportive parent have to go through quietly and alone. I\u2019m so glad we had the kind of relationship where she gently brought me into that process and her rebirth was done holding my hand, supporting each other\u2019s steps into the new.", "You brought tears to my eyes. She is so, so lucky to have a parent like you \ud83e\ude77\ud83d\udc99", "Parents definitely need some time to adjust in situations like that, but they shouldn't lean on their kids to do so. It sounds like you and your daughter have a wonderful relationship and she wanted you to be a part of her journey, which is amazing. But other parents aren't this supportive and many do make massive life changes about themselves.", "NTA, I read once that had the gist of: names are gifts we give our children, they\u2019re usually tied to something or someone we, as parents, like or love. However, like all gifts, sometimes the receiver of that gift grows out of it or it just doesn\u2019t suit them anymore so they put it away and chose something new.\n\nI\u2019m a parent of a trans teen and when they chose their new name, that little bit about gifts popped into my head and I, very cheezily because I\u2019m a dad and cheezy by nature, welcomed (new name) home. We don\u2019t need an explanation or a justification for why someone throws out something we gave them when they were a baby, when they weren\u2019t wholly themselves yet. What we need is to recognize that situations and people change and those of us not directly affected need to take a step back, put our emotional attachment to old things aside for a sec, and accept that.", "I'm going to say NTA, but when you say your adopted parents found out donyou mean you never told them you wanted to go by another name? If so that poses a huge problem and I can see why they'd have an issue HOWEVER not to the degree of the reaction they had.", "i changed my name simply because i hate my old name. i always tell people that if they want to change it, just do it, even if it\u2019s just socially and not legally. it\u2019s so worth it and so much better than just sitting around with a name you don\u2019t want your whole life. names are Everywhere. it\u2019s our most important identifying feature. i\u2019m surprised more people don\u2019t change their names just because they can.", "My niece (wife's sister's daughter) had some traumatic events in her life and has suffered from very serious mental health issues as a result.  Working with her therapist, she changed her name.  Her parents accepted it just fine.  Her grandmother, my wife's mother, did not and is pissed over it.  My MIL lives with wife's sister and refuses to use my niece's new name.  It's been several years now and my MIL still refuses to use the girls name.  It causes additional issues for my niece but MIL doesn't seem to care.  It's sad, MIL is not the best person and my wife has a lot of issues and no self esteem because of her mothers treatment.\n\nNames are very important, the name you accept is your name.  Never let others try and tell you who you are.  Your identity is your own journey, not theirs.", "A name should never come before the wellbeing of the child.", "Could they possibly think you want to change your last name away from theirs, maybe back to your birth parents'? The reaction would make some sense in that context, although their words are unacceptable regardless.", "My take is that the name my husband and I chose fir her, we picked before we knew her. If she grows up and decides it doesn't fit, then she would know best because she is the one living with the name.", "I find emotions like that understandable. After all most parents chose the name full of love etc and called their child by those names their whole life. I also don't get why an Angelo after transitioning can't be Angela, but choses something completely different, so like Carl doesn't become Carla, but Nicole or sth. \n\nBut in the end OP has to live with her name and the adopted parents should respect that. Same with people who transitioned, in the end Nicole feels maybe better then Carla, who knows. \n\nNTA/NAH OP", "I\u2019m not trans but from what I\u2019ve heard some trans people say having a name that\u2019s too close to their deadname can bring up bad memories or be uncomfortable when it\u2019s used. So they pick a name that\u2019s more of a \u201cclean break\u201d. There are people who do what you mentioned though, one of the trans people I know essentially did go from Angelo to Angela."]}
