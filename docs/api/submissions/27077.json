My school is located outside my home province, so I wasn\u2019t expecting to see too many people from high school here. However, I did see this one guy from high school, Thomas (M18), here.\n\nTo say Thomas and I had a difficult past is a bit of an understatement. He tormented my friends, especially me, during our preteen years and for the first two years of high school. He would always call me the most hurtful things and was your typical bully. I don\u2019t know why he hated me, though I think he probably thought I was an easy target.\n\nHe stopped picking on us around grade 11, and I thought that was it. Apparently, according to some of my friends, he turned over a new leaf around that time. Fast forward, and I see him during orientation week. He approached me and said hi. I returned his greeting, and we made some small talk, but I tried to keep things relatively short. During this chat, I learned that (surprise, surprise) we're in the same program and even in the same residence building. He seemed happy with this, as in his words, it was nice to see a familiar face.\n\nOver the next few weeks, we\u2019ve been chatting pretty regularly given that we do have pretty similar schedules. I\u2019ve been trying to give short, polite answers, but whenever we talk, he just doesn\u2019t shut up. I sometimes suspect that he actively seeks me out for a chat.\n\nEarlier today, when I was at the campus gym, I saw Thomas. I tried to avoid his general area in the gym and kept my AirPods in my ears, hoping that he would not notice me. About halfway through my set, I heard him call out to me. We talked for a bit (I was annoyed at this stage, as he did interrupt my workout), and then he starts asking me if I need help with any of the equipment or anything like that and that he could personally train me.\n\nI declined his offer, and then he bluntly asked me out. I didn\u2019t think I heard him properly, so I asked him to repeat what he said. He then said he wanted to take me out for lunch or something like that. I said something along the lines of now wouldn\u2019t be a good time, but he persisted and said that it could be fun.\n\nAt this stage, I snapped. I told him that I thought he was beyond repulsive and dumb as shit if he thought I\u2019d go out with him. He looked very shocked at this, and before anything else could be said, I grabbed my bag and left.\n\nLater, I told my roommate about this, and she said that I was sort of an ass, but that she could understand where I was coming from.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694979386, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16l9www/aita_for_calling_my_former_bully_beyond_repulsive/", "score": 711, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He made your life hell. Bullied you. You\u2019re going to have a lot of anger towards him built up inside. Yeah you snapped at him but I\u2019d do the same if someone had made my life such a hell in school. \nYes he may of changed now but from what you\u2019ve said he\u2019s never actually apologised for any of it.", "NTA it sounds to me like you were just trying to be polite, even outright cool with him, and dude still somehow thought there was vibes. You don't owe him anything, and trauma doesn't just go away.", "NTA.  Unless he got brain damage between grade 11 and now, he has to remember how he treated you.  Hopefully, he now knows that you remember even if he pretends not to.", "NTA.  He doesn't get to just bulldoze his way into your life because he thinks he is somehow entitled to be in it.   Could have been a bit clearer from the get go, but now you're being very clear.", "Has he ever apologized for what he did to you? Or has the topic of why he ever treated you like that. NAH. He tormented you for years so of course you want nothing to do with him. But it does seem like he is trying to make a genuine effort not to the person he use to be. He still has to know there are consequences to his actions", "Another one of these, \"I've changed, so nothing I did before counts\" people.\n\nWell, it counts. People have been scarred for life by bullying. Though I hope you're not one of them.\n\nStop chit chatting with him and tell him that due to the way he acted in high school that you want absolutely nothing to do with him. It's what you should have told him in the first place.\n\nNTA", "NTA..  he is now and always will be a whole string of negative bad memories.. cut him out of your life now and don't feel guilty ever..   nobody ever has to forgive or forget what bad people did to them..", "NTA it\u2019s still fresh for you having been bullied by this guy\u2026 funny how it works when these people (bullies) feel the need to speak to someone they bullied and never apologize \n\nHubby & I we walked past a vehicle the other day and dude yells hubby\u2019s name we look and it\u2019s a guy we knew and hadn\u2019t seen in over 25 years - we moved 3000 kms from our hometown - who almost tore hubby\u2019s finger off in high school (as well as many other times of bullying) \nHe was so happy to see us - called me by my sisters name (didn\u2019t correct bc honestly don\u2019t care for him to know my name if he doesn\u2019t remember) and he wanted to chat - meanwhile I\u2019m walking slowly to our vehicle and he\u2019s still yapping how great to see us - really? \n\n\nHe asked for a cell # and I said he\u2019s on fb we gotta go\u2026 \nNever left a Costco parking lot faster than that day lol\n\nDon\u2019t let anyone tell you he\u2019s changed or your feeling of being bullied should be left in the past or you should befriend someone who was so horrible to you\u2026 he now knows you remember how he treated you and IF he dares come up to you again the first words he says should be an apology!\n\nBest wishes & focus hard in school & your future my dear!", "NTA and all the others saying otherwise had never had to go through your hurting, so it's easy for everyone to point fingers. No one gets to get away with bullying someone and causing permanent damage. NTA by all means it's crazy that you even thought it could be otherwise", "NTA. All of his behavior shows outrageous entitlement. Approaching you and taking your time whenever he sees you, never apologizing for his past bullying, intruding on your gym time, and ge actually thought he had a chance to get with you? Ugh! \n\nIt was absolutely fine to tell him in very clear, bold terms his attention is unwanted and unwelcome.", "Its almost like his actions had consequences. These boys need to learn you can't just treat people however.\nNTA.", "I\u2019ve had an extremely similar thing happen to me. And the dude could not for the life of him understand why I kept turning him down, despite him never apologizing sincerely for the way he treated me.\n\nNTA", "Yes you were an A H but you had the right to be, & sounds like he wasn\u2019t gonna back off otherwise. So ultimately, NTA.", "INFO- In all this time you have been talking, has he ever apologized for his behavior?", "NTA. He's got a lotta balls and not a whole lotta balls to think he can ask you out after tormenting you for years.  Frankly you were nice to him than I would have been and much nicer than he deserved.", "NTA\n\nYou showed more restraint than I could have managed. This guy KNOWS he made your life miserable for years because of his bullying. He hasn\u2019t forgotten and has chosen to ignore it and not acknowledge and sincerely apologize to you. His \u201cnew leaf\u201d should include making amends, not asking you out.", "If he's really changed, then shouldn't he have known not to ask you out, at least not without trying to make amends to you first?\n\nNTA. Bullying can (and should) have consequences.", "NTA, I had one of my bullies try to flirt with me after the fact too. I laid him out verbally. Let him know that after years of his tormenting me I wouldn't take a word he said as having value and to just leave me alone. You did the right thing. It helped you to feel better after being tormented and that is a good thing.", "Nta", "You probably should have told him why you didn't want to hang out with him.\n\nHe may well have turned over a new leaf but if he doesn't realise what he did then you will just look like can ass to everyone else. \n\nTalk to him again and spell it out to him and you might get an apology", "NTA. People can say sorry, but you don\u2019t have to forgive them.", "You should have told him to leave you alone more politely so much sooner.", "NTA, you owe him nothing", "NTA. He seems to think that just because he\u2019s \u201cturned over a new leaf\u201d you have to forget everything he did. That\u2019s completely unrealistic on his part and he needs to back off.", "NTA.\n\nAnd if he continues to approach you, I'd go to someone with authority at the dorms and/or in your program and let them know the history. You don't owe him a moment more of your time.", "NTA, he reaped what he sowed, he made no friends during high school, so now he\u2019s trying to catch any life preservers.  you don\u2019t owe him anything, tell him off and move on", "He shit on you, but then you got hot (in his eyes) now he's nice to you all of a sudden.\n\nNTA.", "The tree remembers what the axe forgets.  \nHe's absolutely free to apologize, but you're not obligated to accept that apology, and he has to live with that.   \nNTA.", "Except for not slapping him down in orientation week, NTA. But I agree with your roommate, really: you let him think all was forgiven by being civil, so no wonder he was shocked. Don't chat politely with former bullies you still hate, for goodness' sake. Tell them to fuck off as soon as they open their mouths. My bullies are ancient history, but if one ever tried to chat with me now, I'd give them a loud warning and 5 seconds to get away from me before I damaged them.", "I'm gonna give a tentative NTA because, as you said, he persisted after your first refusal. One no should have been enough. That said, you would've done better to be more specific about why you don't want to associate with him than saying he's \"beyond repulsive and dumb as shit\".", "NTA but your roommate is.", "NTA.", "NTA by a long shot. It doesn't matter if someone turned a new leaf. If your life is more peaceful without this dude ever making an appearance and you know that, he can fuck right off. You don't owe him your forgiveness. He can be a good guy to everyone else from now on. It won't ever change has already happened.", "NTA.", "Nta", "NTA but should have spoke up earlier.", "NTA although you should\u2019ve been more clear from the beginning you were almost too polite tbh, but still that\u2019s all it was you were being polite he should\u2019ve been able to notice that and leave you alone.", "NTA", "NTA. I get it.", "I don't think you were an AH--NTA--because you have good reason to resent him.  That said, this is now far more stressful for you than it needs to be.  You're going to run into other jerks in life and now would be a good time to think about how to deal with them.\n\nIf you can bring yourself to talk with Thomas, I think you should.  If you don't, you'll be intensely stressed out whenever you see him on campus.  And it seems like you will run into each other often.  Also, if you know the same people at home, a conversation now can help stop any confusing gossip there.\n\nI'm not going to tell you to forget how Thomas treated you in school.  Children know better than anyone else does that bullying is hurtful and wrong.  What I will say is that bullies often have things going on in their own lives that make them lash out.  It is very likely that Thomas came from a chaotic or abusive home or he was bullied himself.  Kids (and many adults) genuinely do struggle with how to manage their anger or sadness.  Maybe Thomas was mean to everyone at school because he was powerless at home.  \n\nPlease don't think that I'm trying to guilt you into excusing his behavior.  I'm just trying to get you to understand that it's unlikely to have been about anything you did wrong and that MAYBE--and only if he is showing evidence of having changed--you could consider talking with him and taking the first step towards not hating him.\n\nI would take control of the situation by approaching him for a talk.  You don't have to do it in person if that would be too hard.  You could text him or even ask his RA (or whatever the dorm supervisor is called where you are) to pass on a message.  That way, he'd have time to think and if a dorm supervisor spoke with him, that person could communicate the problem and he'd be less likely to be in denial.  Just let him know how resentful you feel towards him because of the years of unhappiness he caused.  \n\nDon't feel like you need to react instantaneously to anything he says.  You're allowed to think things over.  I know that it takes me a few weeks to get over difficult situations before I can talk about them.  Tell him you need time to think if that's what happens.  I'd even talk to a counselor on campus about everything.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA.  Bullies don't deserve to be forgiven.", "Unfortunately, you trying to just be polite the entire time until you snapped gave him the impression you were over what happened in middle/high school. I absolutely understand why you did that, but I also can't fault the oblivious teen boy for not understanding you wanted nothing to do with him until you used the nuclear option. This is honestly a learning experience for you to be able to speak your mind if you're not interested in interacting with someone before it gets to completely blowing up at the person. In the first handful of times, when it became clear he was going to continue to try and interact with you, something along the lines of \"I get that you appreciate seeing a familiar face around here, but considering how badly you treated me throughout the time we previously knew each other I'm not interested in being friends at this point\" is enough to get the point across. How he reacts to that is then his problem. Stuff like this comes with time and maturity though so again, I get why that wasn't your go-to reaction.\n\nNAH", "I think this dude wants attention which was probably also his problem before. I don't think you're TA but you shouldn't have been talking to him the entire time. A lot of dudes don't understand hints. After doing that, being that blunt was probably the only thing that would get it through his head. \n\nI don't think he was trying to make amends at all. I'm sorry doesn't fix years of behavior nor should it.", "NTA, BUT you should have told him why. I wish I could tell my bully he was a horrible piece of sht! That was your opportunity!!", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve become friends with one of my bullies from high school but only after he apologized to me & acknowledged that he did a lot of things that were cruel & uncalled for. \n\nThis guy\u2026 hasn\u2019t apologized & to me has an agenda.", "I'm tending towards E S H. You chatted with him politely for weeks instead of telling him straight on that you haven't forgiven him for his bullying. Now you go and call him repulsive out of the blue without any explanation. That's not ok.\n\nThat he's seeking you out and trying to forge a friendship or more with you without even acknowledging how he treated you before is not okay either, though.", "Leaning NTA - But did he apologize for being a bully? Did you tell him that you suffered because of him? He needs to know his actions have consequences.", "[deleted]", "Let me get this straight\u2026. A significant amount of time passes and he\u2019s making a clear attempt to be friendly. Although you think you\u2019re sending signals, you don\u2019t overtly discourage him. He misreads the situation and thinks there\u2019s an opportunity to be more than friends and he politely asks you out. You\u2019re response is to lash out and insult him because he didn\u2019t pick up on your hints and is oblivious to the hurt he caused years ago?  Yes, YTA. That doesn\u2019t forgive him for what he did in the past, but you were absolutely the asshole.  I teetered on everyone sucks here, but I limited my consideration to the current situation and not the past. He was the asshole then, but you\u2019re the asshole now. From what I can see from all the not A H comments on here, they seem to support \u201c2 wrongs make a right\u201d which is stupid", "YTA \nDid you enjoy being bullied? No you didn't so idk why you would go to a bully's level and say something like that", "\u201cBeyond repulsive\u201d may have been a little much cause it implies ugly physical features(even if you meant personality wise) and that\u2019s a line i personally won\u2019t cross, regardless of who I\u2019m talking to or how enraged I am. That doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t deserved though. NTA.", "It sounds as if the guy is trying possibly to make amends for being such an ass in high school, but the OP still has so much resentment towards him that it's left too deep a scar to heal.", "NAH. (Currently. Obviously he was an AH for bullying you in the past. A huge one.)\n\nAs someone who was bullied for a while, it sucks. Would I want contact with my former bullies: nope. But they also never made an effort to apologise or build bridges.\n\nYou mentioned that he apologised in 11th grade, which means he\u2019s aware of his actions and has realised how much in the wrong he was. That\u2019s a huge step.\n\nDoes it mean you need to forgive him? No. Of course not.\n\nI kind of got the impression that he was trying to build bridges and truly thought you were both putting the past behind you. He had no malicious intent and was probably genuinely happy about going to uni with you and knowing someone already.\n\nIn your stead I would sit down with him and calmly explain where you\u2019re coming from. You don\u2019t owe him anything, but this will be the healthiest option for you to. Talk to him how much it impacted you. How you still perceive him as that kind of person. Lay it out why you reacted how you did.\n\nIt can go in two directions from there. Either that ends any and all contact between you two. Totally fine. Or you give him a chance to show you he was sincere in his apology and has truly become a different person. Not saying you should go ahead and date him, just see if a friendship would be a possibility. If no, totally fine.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA though I think you could have been a better person.  The weird thing is that he has probably liked you all this time  but his immature, juvenile mind could only express it through abuse.  That is not your problem", "NTA when I come across my bullies from high school (shared acquaintances) I try to be polite because other people around don't really understand the trauma and end up thinking I am the bad guy.\n\nGrowing up even bullies are entitled to better themselves but that does't mean that their victims have to be \"the better person\"\n\nwhat he got was probably just a fraction of what he inflicted, let's hope this give I'm the chance to think about his mistakes", "Fuck me", "I recently had a conversation with a guy who was really mean to me in middle school. I was like you- trying to keep it short and get out of the conversation as soon as I could- but he wanted to talk about The Old Days. Based on how he talked, I think he only remembers the good things and not that he and his friends were mean.\n\nAll that said, you're NTA (or possibly the Justified AH) but I am beginning to think people don't always remember the bad parts of themselves or see themselves as bullies. So that guy was probably really confused as to why you yelled at him.", "YTA. Blowing up about a past hurt with no context when someone is being polite is a YOU issue. Carrying the hurt from past bullying is valid, but it doesn't mean others know where your headspace is. You would have both been better served communicating clearly that you still held resentment about the bullying and had to decline, putting the ball in his court to apologize or deny it and leave. Or a simple no thank you if you don't want to get into it. Bullying isn't okay from anyone, and in this case, you were a bully and an unnecessary asshole.", "YTA. People who bully are hurting and looking to share. People who don't fight back choose to be victims. It's an asshole contest and you're all losers.", "ESH Yeah as someone who went through similar with the bullying (i was and still am a bit odd). I understand the absolute urge to lose it when they try to pretend they weren\u2019t an ass hat. But you went off on him, as far as he\u2019s concerned for no reason. You spoke to him for weeks which if he was ever aware of what he\u2019d done (yes some of them don\u2019t believe they\u2019ve done anything wrong), he\u2019d think you\u2019d put it behind you and forgiven him.", "He clearly liked you back when he bullied you, it was a way of showing you attention, being close to you but too afraid to be honest. This happens all the time. Ahh hormones.", "YTA. Bigtime . Huge.", "ESH.\n\nHe pushed too hard on going out even if you were just a stranger or someone he hadn't had a bad past with. Take a no.\n\nBut you've been giving him false signals all this time that it's ok to talk, that you let it go, and you've been holding onto the resentment. There are two possibilities. One is that he hasn't changed. But it doesn't sound like he's being that way to people any more. The second is that he did grapple with it and changed. At least a little. Maybe he hasn't really atoned or felt pain for what he did but it sounds like he did stop it. And maybe he did do all that.\n\nIn that second and much more likely scenario you failed to advertise you wanted to be left alone all that time, gave him a false impression you two were ok, then snapped on him.\n\n\"Short answers\" is not a clue to guys. Especially if you actually are talking a lot as you were by your own admission. That's not a hint. That's a false signal that even if things aren't high energy this is fine.", "Yta. He was the ahole in the past but you're not allowing yourself to believe people can change.\n\nYou definitely do not need to befriend him nor date him if you aren't interested in him platonically or sexually, but to explode like you did on someone who is genuinely being nice and has been nice to you since you both started at college is a little petty. \n\nMany people are going to disagree with me because you're a woman likely, but I think basic courtesy goes beyond gender.\n\nCalling him dumb as shit is an attack, very similar to those he used to do to you.

He WAS an AH but you ARE one.", "Honestly i think esh and only because you should've shut that shit down sooner.  By trying to be polite he is under the impression you guys could or have moved past it. As someone who has also been bullied he was dumb for thinking youd be interested after what hes done.

I returned his greeting, and we made some small talk, but I tried to keep things relatively short. During this chat, I learned that (surprise, surprise) we're in the same program and even in the same residence building. He seemed happy with this, as in his words, it was nice to see a familiar face.\n\nOver the next few weeks, we\u2019ve been chatting pretty regularly given that we do have pretty similar schedules. I\u2019ve been trying to give short, polite answers, but whenever we talk, he just doesn\u2019t shut up. I sometimes suspect that he actively seeks me out for a chat.\n\nEarlier today, when I was at the campus gym, I saw Thomas. I tried to avoid his general area in the gym and kept my AirPods in my ears, hoping that he would not notice me. About halfway through my set, I heard him call out to me. We talked for a bit (I was annoyed at this stage, as he did interrupt my workout), and then he starts asking me if I need help with any of the equipment or anything like that and that he could personally train me.\n\nI declined his offer, and then he bluntly asked me out. I didn\u2019t think I heard him properly, so I asked him to repeat what he said. He then said he wanted to take me out for lunch or something like that. I said something along the lines of now wouldn\u2019t be a good time, but he persisted and said that it could be fun.\n\nAt this stage, I snapped. I told him that I thought he was beyond repulsive and dumb as shit if he thought I\u2019d go out with him. He looked very shocked at this, and before anything else could be said, I grabbed my bag and left.\n\nLater, I told my roommate about this, and she said that I was sort of an ass, but that she could understand where I was coming from.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
