You may not be aware of it, but a lot of your decisions and choices throughout your environment are driven by your desire to uphold traditional gender roles. It pervades everything you do and everyone you interact with, and you subconsciously judge each person and interaction by those gender roles. Your justification of your decision to exclude your nephew from dinner preparations is laughable, at the very least. He was bored playing outside alone, and you **allowed that to continue** when you could've brought him inside to do something helpful, especially since he actually volunteered.

Why didn't you give Harry a task or split the work between them? You probably even made him feel excluded considering he asked to be involved... twice.", "YTA.

They were playing together and you dragged one away from the other to help with a task that would have been done quicker with two more sets of hands, but you wanted to \"spend girl time\" by setting a table?????? \n\nEasiest way to involve both, one takes plats, the other grabs glasses, and the last one grabs the utensils, as there were three of you this would have been a quick family way of doing it, but you wanted \"girl time\" and thus excluded your nephew who ASKED if you needed more help", "YTA. You can make excuses about it being a one-kid job but let's be real we both know that you picked Katie for a reason.

Did it ever occur to you that he might have wanted to spend time with you too?\n\nThis is such a perfect little microcosm of how the patriarchy hurts men almost as much as it hurts women. You pulled Katie away from having fun with her brother to help serve food for the group while her brother continued to play, subconsciously reinforcing the notion that she as a girl is obligated to set aside her own happiness in service. But you clearly also saw Katie being pulled into service as a bonding moment, and you were probably kind and made her feel important and competent. Which reinforces your own ideas about what Katie should do and what kinds of tasks she should be proud of doing well, but also probably felt good to Katie. She might say she genuinely enjoyed spending time with her aunt. Subconsciously you were initiating Katie into a special club. Meanwhile, Harry is exempt from serving others and allowed to continue playing, but you've taken away his playmate so she can serve him lunch. He's literally bored. He sees you and Katie and does what feels naturally, he wants to help. More to the point, he wants to bond with you and Katie. But instead, you send him back to play alone, stuck on the outside.

No one would say that it\u2019s unreasonable for you to want to spend one on one time with your niece in advance of your own little girl\u2019s arrival.

Your sister has been very clear about how she wants you to interact with her kids and you should take the note. But I do think you\u2019ll need to make some careful choices going forward in how you raise your kids. Remember, the whole point of feminism is that women are all allowed to make their own lifestyle choices. You\u2019ve chosen a certain set of behaviors that work for you and your family, and that\u2019s fine. But make sure that your daughter understands that the way you live is only one of many choices available to her.

That poor little girl won't have a chance.", "Don't disagree with the YTA, OPs decision was definitely based on her own biases, but just to clarify, you think that any woman who willingly chooses for themselves to be a stay at home wife or Mom is just wrong and is outdated in their beliefs?", "Funny isn't it that the one thing they manage to do that's shared between the sexes is the harm they cause them.", "7 year olds can do chores.

It\u2019s great that your family\u2019s subversion if expectations helps to challenge the stereotype; at the same time, being identified as a Girl or a Boy, especially in groups is labeling based on sex, and carries various connotations thanks to the stereotyping that has taken place for generations.

Even those visual cues alone underscore differences among children separated by Gender rather than all the kids are just kids and encouraged to play with whatever they want.", "I grew up at a time and place where girls being raised as \"Tom boys\" was fun and cool for the dad's. \nMy mom had 3 boys and we all had to do chores, laundry, cleaning, helping in the kitchen. \nAt the same time tho, if you were a shy boy who sucked at sports and didn't really like sports or cars something was wrong with you because your a boy. \nIt was very weird."]}
