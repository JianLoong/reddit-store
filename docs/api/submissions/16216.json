You may not be aware of it, but a lot of your decisions and choices throughout your environment are driven by your desire to uphold traditional gender roles. It pervades everything you do and everyone you interact with, and you subconsciously judge each person and interaction by those gender roles. Your justification of your decision to exclude your nephew from dinner preparations is laughable, at the very least. He was bored playing outside alone, and you **allowed that to continue** when you could've brought him inside to do something helpful, especially since he actually volunteered.

Why didn't you give Harry a task or split the work between them? You probably even made him feel excluded considering he asked to be involved... twice.", "YTA. You reinforced gender norms onto other people\u2019s children, whom you know do not respect such outdated beliefs.

You are teaching Katie that her role is to do chores while Harry plays.", "YTA - this is nowhere near forcing our beliefs on them, but more about involving both of them.

I can see why she perceives it that way though.", "YTA\n\nHarry asked if you needed his help too and you said \"you didn't need that much help\". They were playing together and you dragged one away from the other to help with a task that would have been done quicker with two more sets of hands, but you wanted to \"spend girl time\" by setting a table?????? \n\nEasiest way to involve both, one takes plats, the other grabs glasses, and the last one grabs the utensils, as there were three of you this would have been a quick family way of doing it, but you wanted \"girl time\" and thus excluded your nephew who ASKED if you needed more help", "YTA. You can make excuses about it being a one-kid job but let's be real we both know that you picked Katie for a reason.

Did it ever occur to you that he might have wanted to spend time with you too?\n\nThis is such a perfect little microcosm of how the patriarchy hurts men almost as much as it hurts women. You pulled Katie away from having fun with her brother to help serve food for the group while her brother continued to play, subconsciously reinforcing the notion that she as a girl is obligated to set aside her own happiness in service. But you clearly also saw Katie being pulled into service as a bonding moment, and you were probably kind and made her feel important and competent. Which reinforces your own ideas about what Katie should do and what kinds of tasks she should be proud of doing well, but also probably felt good to Katie. She might say she genuinely enjoyed spending time with her aunt. Subconsciously you were initiating Katie into a special club. Meanwhile, Harry is exempt from serving others and allowed to continue playing, but you've taken away his playmate so she can serve him lunch. He's literally bored. He sees you and Katie and does what feels naturally, he wants to help. More to the point, he wants to bond with you and Katie. But instead, you send him back to play alone, stuck on the outside.

In the moment, while Katie was helping you, Harry made it clear that he was bored and he wanted to help as well. You missed an opportunity there to engage with him and do something constructive with him. Instead, since he wasn\u2019t of use to you, you ignored him. That\u2019s not great. \n2. No one would say that it\u2019s unreasonable for you to want to spend one on one time with your niece in advance of your own little girl\u2019s arrival.

Your sister has been very clear about how she wants you to interact with her kids and you should take the note. But I do think you\u2019ll need to make some careful choices going forward in how you raise your kids. Remember, the whole point of feminism is that women are all allowed to make their own lifestyle choices. You\u2019ve chosen a certain set of behaviors that work for you and your family, and that\u2019s fine. But make sure that your daughter understands that the way you live is only one of many choices available to her.

She literally said \"I definitely don't think anyone should be forced into living the way we do.\" And besides, there were no ulterior motives. She just wanted some help, from one kid, to set the table. \"Oh my gosh she asked her to SET THE TABLE? The horror\"", "OP also said:\n\n>Harry asked if I wanted him to help too but I didn't need that much help. \n\nWhich doesn't make any sense for multiple reasons. She didn't have to explicitly state that her reason was gender bias, kids notice when the girl is asked to help and the boy is told not to help even when he offers. That kind of stuff does have an effect on kids.", "'little girl' isn't a personality type\n\nOne of the most upsetting things I saw on pregnancy/baby message boards: mothers who turned their baby's biological sex into a personality trait.", "I love how she says she didn't need that much help but they were gone long enough for nephew to get bored. Op needs to stop lying to herself", "Hold on - you and TWO cousins?  (Three total) And it took you 1/3 of the time?!\n\n....one second.....\n\nYep, math checks out \\^\\_\\^", "yea but I bet none of you were *boys*\n\n/s obviously wtf", "THIS. As the eldest AFAB, I was made to be head of cleaning table clothes and polishing flatware every thanksgiving. I had two younger cousins and a brother. Guess who didn\u2019t have to help?", "Absolutely!   Watching how hard she worked for that, I\u2019m sooooo careful now to make sure I use the appropriate titles.  It might just be an honorific, but people EARN them.", "Holy hell that's a lot of garbage, and I only went back like 2 days", "Cool - again, just because someone could interpret OP\u2019s actions in a particular way doesn\u2019t mean OP was forcing her beliefs on anyone.\n\nThe mental gymnastics that folks will go through to get offended is hilarious though.\n\nI stand by my judgement.", "Lol the 2 of them were. I won't lie my uncle came in after them to fix what they did though lol", "Definitely. Earning a doctorate of any kind is nothing to turn your nose up at.", "Yep, scratch transphobic person, reveal a racist, misogynistic vile monster, every single time", "And the mental gymnastics that you go through to justify OP's actions is hilarious. OP saw two children playing outside, and decided to ask the younger child, and therefore very likely the less capable child, to help. And then refused the help of the older child even when he volunteered multiple times to help. To look at that, when combined with OP admitting that she supports traditional gender roles, and think that there's nothing to it, is being intentionally obtuse.", "I\u2019ve already stated there\u2019s probably some unconscious bias there.  \n\nIt does not equate to \u201cforcing her beliefs\u201d on the children though.  This is innocuous\n\nThe question isn\u2019t \u201cdoes OP have biases?\u201d Or \u201cshould OP have done something different?\u201d.  The question is:  does this interaction give an example of OP forcing her beliefs on someone else\u2019s kid\u201d\n\nThe answer is:  absolutely not."]}
