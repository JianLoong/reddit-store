{"id": 5170, "submission_id": "zqcsdx", "title": "AITA for not leaving an equal share of inheritance to my step children as my biological child in my will.", "selftext": "I (55M) married my wife (52F) two decades ago, bringing with her two children from her previous marriage (27F, 30M). We also have a child of our own (19F). I am the primary breadwinner, my wife has always been SAHM to raise all three children, and since they have left, continues to run the house, and I am more than happy with this arrangement. Most of our joint assets therefore came from my income - wife came to the marriage with no assets.\n\nWe are aware that wife's ex-husband has had a windfall of inheritance money (as conveyed by my step children). This means that my step children are set to inherit that windfall if not squandered. Their paternal grandmother and other family members are still in the picture with possible inheritance that may yet be passed down. Conversely my biological daughter would not benefit from that inheritance money, and would only benefit from whatever inheritance I can give her (no other relatives in the picture that could support her or leave additional inheritance money).\n\nI have therefore chosen (with support from my wife) to will a larger portion of inheritance to my biological daughter. For example, if my wife and I died in an accident tomorrow, we would be leaving about $900K in assets to 19F, and $25K each to 27F and 30M. 19F would have no family support thus relying entirely on the inheritance money, whereas 27F and 30M will still have other family members that can support them. If ex-husband died tomorrow, 27F and 30M are likely to receive $250K each in assets, if not more, and will still have us to help support them when needed, as we currently do.\n\nWhen we discussed this with 27F and 30M, emphasizing that they are set to receive inheritance from ex-husband, and potentially others on his side of the family. They determined this was unfair, that my assets should be split evenly between 19F, 27F and 30M. I retorted that if their father died, would 19F get any of that inheritance, and they said no, because he is not her father.\n\nTo be fair, they do look up to me, and consider me as a father-figure, even though I am not their father. Therefore I am wondering if I am the asshole?  \n\n\nETA: I've been looking at some really insightful comments about how to calculate what to give my step children, with a number of comments suggesting I do need to give more. One or two people have suggested a formula of first splitting assets in half - considering 50/50 between wife and myself, and then dividing the 50 between the three children, essentially giving my step children about 1/6 each. However as noted above there is more to consider here than a simple division, such as support from others, but also some of this is physical assets like a house that cannot be simply considered as cash value, but it is clear that we (wife and I, this is a joint decision) should be willing a higher amount to my step children.

How is that different from them and you? They are being greedy OP. You can tell because they think it's unfair when you do the exact same thing to them that they want to do to her.", "NTA as long as you base your argument on their windfall from their biological family and not on the fact that your wife was a SAH wife.

But I see no reason why you ever should\u2019ve discussed it with the 3 kids in the first place. You and your wife are in agreement, why ask the kids for their opinion, especially since you\u2019re only in your 50s", "NTA. You're giving your bio daughter an equal opportunity for financial stability as her half-siblings. That's your job as her parent.", "NTA. \n\n\nLike you said she not gonna have anybody to support her especially financially. You could\u2019ve left them nothing but you decided to leave them more than enough.", "NTA. They\u2019re being greedy.

Your youngest will be disadvantaged.", "You are right with your math. Because they have their resources lined up for them.", "These are always so tough. I get that you want to do right by your daughter, but they're feeling like you're not treating them as your children.

His family can squander it and be left nothing. \n\nThat said if you and your wife are a true partnership why not spilt it 50/50 with your wife. Your 50% goes 100% to your daughter and your wife\u2019s portion gets divided 3 ways. Since essentially she has 3 kids. To me that is more fair. Leaving a token gift of 25k while other kid gets close to 1 million to me is insulting. Again take ex\u2019s family out of the picture as what they do with their money doesn\u2019t matter as they are not family to you. I\u2019ll be honest if I was the kid in that situation I would be extremely hurt and may go NC.

It's a slap in the face to your stepkids, in my opinion. And sharing this information with them just seems cruel. I can't blame them for being upset. I'm not arguing it needs to be equal, but this just makes it seem like you're giving them a small, token amount just so they don't put up a fuss about the will or try to dispute it.

(By the way, it's better to express inheritance in percentages instead of $ as $ will change over time.) Is that big of a discrepancy necessary? I understand the 19 y/o needs $ for college, housing, etc. But this is closer to a lottery than an inheritance. Maybe calculate her actual expected needs that the step-kids already have, and weigh the inheritance that way. That might give you a 50%-25%-25% (or 60-20-20, etc.) distribution, which might make everyone a bit more comfortable.\n2. I saw no mention of trusts: are there any in place? 900K is a lot for a 19-year-old, especially in those circumstances. You can set up a trust that distributes a certain amount per year, allocates $ for college or housing, etc.\n3. Any inheritance from the ex-husband (their bio father) is not a guarantee. If you know their finances and have a pretty good comfort level, that's great. But it's not a guarantee. And your step-kids can do math: 250K (assumed, from bio-dad) + 25K (from you) does not come close to 900K.
