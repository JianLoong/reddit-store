{"id": 5170, "submission_id": "zqcsdx", "title": "AITA for not leaving an equal share of inheritance to my step children as my biological child in my will.", "selftext": "I (55M) married my wife (52F) two decades ago, bringing with her two children from her previous marriage (27F, 30M). We also have a child of our own (19F). I am the primary breadwinner, my wife has always been SAHM to raise all three children, and since they have left, continues to run the house, and I am more than happy with this arrangement. Most of our joint assets therefore came from my income - wife came to the marriage with no assets.\n\nWe are aware that wife's ex-husband has had a windfall of inheritance money (as conveyed by my step children). This means that my step children are set to inherit that windfall if not squandered. Their paternal grandmother and other family members are still in the picture with possible inheritance that may yet be passed down. Conversely my biological daughter would not benefit from that inheritance money, and would only benefit from whatever inheritance I can give her (no other relatives in the picture that could support her or leave additional inheritance money).\n\nI have therefore chosen (with support from my wife) to will a larger portion of inheritance to my biological daughter. For example, if my wife and I died in an accident tomorrow, we would be leaving about $900K in assets to 19F, and $25K each to 27F and 30M. 19F would have no family support thus relying entirely on the inheritance money, whereas 27F and 30M will still have other family members that can support them. If ex-husband died tomorrow, 27F and 30M are likely to receive $250K each in assets, if not more, and will still have us to help support them when needed, as we currently do.\n\nWhen we discussed this with 27F and 30M, emphasizing that they are set to receive inheritance from ex-husband, and potentially others on his side of the family. They determined this was unfair, that my assets should be split evenly between 19F, 27F and 30M. I retorted that if their father died, would 19F get any of that inheritance, and they said no, because he is not her father.\n\nTo be fair, they do look up to me, and consider me as a father-figure, even though I am not their father. Therefore I am wondering if I am the asshole?", "created_utc": 1671506368, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zqcsdx/aita_for_not_leaving_an_equal_share_of/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This sub seems to think step parents have to be perfect and there is no differences ever. \n\nFirst off, I personally am fine with step kids getting less of an inheritance.  i say this as someone who grew up in a blended family.\n\nThrow in the face that their father has a totally separate inheritance for them and they'll have more anyway, i'd say your step kids are just greedy.", "NTA Very telling that they said no sharing their inheritance because their father is not her father. How is that different from them and you? They are being greedy OP. You can tell because they think it's unfair when you do the exact same thing to them that they want to do to her.", "NTA as long as you base your argument on their windfall from their biological family and not on the fact that your wife was a SAH wife. Presumably, she did domestic work that often goes uncompensated and would have cost you a lot more if you needed to replace her sacrifice with a housekeeper, babysitter, and cook.", "NTA. It's your money. You can give it to OJ Simpson if you want. I think the strategy that you and your wife have decided upon is very equitable. I would do something similar in your situation.", "NTA. They\u2019re being obtuse on purpose. If they can understand why their bio dad would not leave anything to their half sister, then they should understand why YOU would leave more to her than to them. Life isn\u2019t always fair, but you have to make the best decisions you can to protect the people you love. Sounds like they\u2019d be taken care of either way, so not sure why they\u2019re acting up. Greed is a horrible thing.", "NTA. But I see no reason why you ever should\u2019ve discussed it with the 3 kids in the first place. You and your wife are in agreement, why ask the kids for their opinion, especially since you\u2019re only in your 50s", "NTA. You're giving your bio daughter an equal opportunity for financial stability as her half-siblings. That's your job as her parent.", "NTA. \n\n\nLike you said she not gonna have anybody to support her especially financially. You could\u2019ve left them nothing but you decided to leave them more than enough.", "NTA. They\u2019re being greedy. Labeling you as family but not their sister as a reason to why they are entitled to the inheritance is flawed logic. You should leave them 10K only. Your youngest will be disadvantaged.", "You are right with your math. Because they have their resources lined up for them.", "These are always so tough. I get that you want to do right by your daughter, but they're feeling like you're not treating them as your children. I don't know your family dynamic, but I know a lot of stepkids feel left out. \n\nI would suggest potentially splitting it more equitably, but perhaps not 1/3 each", "NTA i would give them each a dollar after having them argue for more money", "NTA not at all.", "NTA - it is up to you to gift your possessions to who you please. I hate to say this, but your kids sound a little greedy. They should be happy to respect your final wishes.", "NTA because it is your and your wife\u2019s money. But I do feel the split is lot equitable. You should not factor in what ex\u2019s family is giving them. Who knows what is in the will or not. His family can squander it and be left nothing. \n\nThat said if you and your wife are a true partnership why not spilt it 50/50 with your wife. Your 50% goes 100% to your daughter and your wife\u2019s portion gets divided 3 ways. Since essentially she has 3 kids. To me that is more fair. Leaving a token gift of 25k while other kid gets close to 1 million to me is insulting. Again take ex\u2019s family out of the picture as what they do with their money doesn\u2019t matter as they are not family to you. I\u2019ll be honest if I was the kid in that situation I would be extremely hurt and may go NC. Not because of the money but it tells me I am not a valued family member like your bio daughter. \n\nOverall though NTA because it is your money and you can do with it as you please.", "NTA. You are leaving them with something, and their mother agrees and supports this. Please don't listen to them and do what you want, since it's your money. If they continue to push this topic, you can adjust your will and leave them with $1.", "Welp, now it all has to go to charity. Lessons for everyone.", "NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA.  You are being fair and even tried to explain your reasoning to them.  AND your wife (their mom) is on board with everything.  That alone makes you NTA,  let alone once the other family & possible inheritance is factored in.  Good luck.", "NTA", "NTA I understand that your stepchildren still have their bio dad in the picture to provide for them/leave them an inheritance. But I'm really tempted to vote E S H because...\n\n\"$900K in assets to 19F, and $25K each to 27F and 30M\"\n\nThat is such an absolutely outrageous difference. Enough money to buy a house and still have enough leftover that the rest could be put into an ETF and gain enough to completely fund retirement....Versus enough money for lower end, new vehicle.\n\nThat's just too much of a difference. It's a slap in the face to your stepkids, in my opinion. And sharing this information with them just seems cruel. I can't blame them for being upset. I'm not arguing it needs to be equal, but this just makes it seem like you're giving them a small amount just so they don't put up a fuss about the will. I think you need to reconsider how the money is being divided, especially if you actually do car about your relationship with your stepchildren.", "NTA - you made the mistake of letting them know, so now you can look forward to resentment for the rest of your life. 25k seems low, but it's your money. But - they will think about this all.the.time. like when you need care when you are older. Maybe just spend it all before you die and solve the problem.", "NTA - and why do people discuss their will and inheritance with children? It's none of their business until you are gone and it's inappropriate to make it a group discussion where people often feel entitled and don't care if someone else is getting screwed over.", "Nta for now and if wife is on board. \nHowever - without her being SAHM for years taking care of the majority of the home work, you wouldn't have all those assets. So it is more fair that you ensure she has some \"her savings\" that she can leave to whomever she wants. Assets you acquire while she supports you are joint assets. You both may still feel that a high % to youngest is best as older kids have other people who can support. But soft y.t.a for the way you are treating the money like it is all yours and none of it is wife's to discuss the plans of or distribute. \n\nShe may also want to change the will later and be willing to discuss as her being home has supported that wealth accumulation. \n\nI am the youngest by 10 years. When I was a similar age I was aware that my mums had more money got to me than my older siblings as I was about to need to move many hours away to attend university and they were already established. Later, after I finished uni and was mid 20s the will changed to split everything evenly.", "NTA", "ESH. While your stepchildren seem to be a bit greedy, it seems that you could be a little more generous since they\u2019ve had you as a father figure for 20+ years. Maybe 600k to your bio daughter and 300k split between stepchildren. Then when they split the 500k from their father IF they get any, it would give them each 400k?", "You have been these kids father for over 20 years. You had your wife stay home to watch the kids. \n\nYes it's OK to give your kid more. \n\nBut 900k to 25k and 25k?  \n\n Yta. \n\nAre they really only worth 1.25k a year (less because you are not dead yet) of their lives to you?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You made your will,  you mentioned it to the kids, now move on and live your best life. NTA but stop talking about it. It hurts your stepkids.", "YTA.  I can understand giving more to your daughter but the split is very unfair.  Even if your stepkids get the full inheritance from their father, it is far less than your daughter.  That inheritance is not guaranteed.  You have no control over other peoples money.  You also risk alienating your daughter from the only family she will have after you and your wife are gone\u2026.her siblings.  Her siblings are worth more than any amount of money.  Your wife has not built any wealth of her own because she has been a sahm.  You should be more considerate of the sacrifices she has made and be better to her children.", "NTA because your wife had agreed to this split, your step sons have an involved father,  and they have other paternal relatives that your child doesn't have. As long as you and your wife agreed on how to soplit any inheritance I see no problem. Plus, you're both young so there's nothing set on stone that you can't decide to change it later as your child maturess and becomes established in life.", "Literally just increase the amount to each of your step kids by $75k each, $100k for both, each. Your bio daughter still gets north of 700k, your step kids are now also getting stuff in the 6 figures, plus the $250k from their bio dad each, plus support from living relatives (which bio daughter doesn\u2019t have).\n\nFar more fair, and unless you\u2019re literally living like pariahs, 6 figures isn\u2019t anything to scoff at. NTA btw, you\u2019re one of the last people bio daughter has left, she should still get majority for the worst case scenario.\n\nBtw that\u2019s 250 + 100 for each step kid, both together that\u2019s $700k combined. Far, far more balanced. You really shouldn\u2019t go higher than that.

Was it a necessity that they knew about the money? Are you guys planning to jump out a plane or do crazy activities? If the answer is no then yes YTA. You've now probably  cause issues within your family and the step kids are going ti be salty brats probably to the 19 yr old. Or they are going to start bugging you or even threatening you to change the will.", "NTA \n\nWhy? You asked if their dad died would your daughter receive any money and they said no. He isn\u2019t her dad. Well you aren\u2019t their dad and all assets are yours\u2026soooo .", "NTA. I think you looked at this in a very logical way. It makes sense when you factor in all the extras the step kids are set up to receive. They are not looking at it like that. They are looking at it from an emotional standpoint. With this mentality they see: \u201cBy you giving her more money, it means you love her more than us.\u201d  Although this isn\u2019t true given your thought process, they just aren\u2019t going to see it that way. As long as you and your wife are in agreement, you should just put your foot down and say it\u2019s a done deal. Make it clear that it\u2019s non-negotiable.  There\u2019s no good way to handle this from here. They will have to figure out a way to deal with it.  Also the fact that all of the money came from you working is a moot point here. At the end of the day, it was a joint decision.  It doesn\u2019t matter who physically contributed to it.", "ESH. For their part nobody\u2019s kids are entitled to anything, and for yours there was no reason to say anything and start all this garbage.", "Exactly, she has sacrificed a lot. She is fully on board with this decision and reasoning.", "That said\u2026 you HAVE a relationship with them that their bio dad does NOT have with your daughter, so it\u2019s not exactly apples and oranges. You should probably consider the money to be a marital asset (which it is), and your wife would split her half three ways while yours goes to your daughter. So, she would get 2/3 with that math and your step kids would split the other third.", "I don't think its to get their opinion, I think its so everyone is on the same page in case anything happens. \n\nDeaths can tear a family apart, especially when there are \"surprises\" in the will.  \n\nI think its smart, even if the step kids didn't like what they herad.", "This is the split that I think is fair and what I was thinking of doing with my kid and stepkids.  \n\nKeep in mind, that while you have this plan in place now, if your wife gets everything if you pass, there really isn't anything to keep her from changing the plan once you're gone.", "You make a reasonable point (as do others) about increasing the amount to the step children.", "Yes, my wife and I consider our assets for the most part joint - exception being personal gifts, such as her jewelry for example. The decision of what to do with our assets was made jointly. She actually handles most of the finances, which is part of the \"run the house\" comment.\n\nI'm sorry it came off as I'm calling it my money, I do not see it that way at all.", "Thanks for considering. It's worth noting, if it makes a difference, that it's not just the financial part, but also that step children will continue to have other family help them, where there is no such support in place for my daughter.", "You bring up a fair point that maybe I should leave more for them. They have received other gifts (e.g. a car, money towards wedding etc.). I will take into consideration about giving them a little more each.", "Exactly - When people have these conversations, it\u2019s usually an effort to avoid anybody being blindsided at the time they already lost their loved one or an attempt to explain the reasons behind the decision to avoid any animosity while everyone is grieving. \n\nI\u2019m going through this with my grandmother right now and her reasoning is that it\u2019s important to her that she know if there\u2019s anything of hers that\u2019s really special to us. For example, I want her books because she and I are both avid readers and even though we like different genres, having them would bring me happiness and make me think of her. None of us is gonna come out and say that stuff to her, so if she didn\u2019t ask, she wouldn\u2019t know.", "The current split is mutually decided on, and I know the plan would not change if I died first, but as I've posted a reply elsewhere, we will take into consideration a larger amount. Conversely we (wife included, it is a joint decision) are trying to also consider the support my two step children will have vs my biological child.", "I think the difference is reasonable. If they are set get an inheritance from you, biofather, and others possibly that all adds up. Their inheritance could possibly end up being about the same. Your reasoning is fair and just. Leave it as is. NTA.", "What do you mean by help? Aren't they fully launched adults?", "Even as adults, they get help - e.g. financial help for a new vehicle, or towards a wedding."]}
