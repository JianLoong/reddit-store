{"id": 5170, "submission_id": "zqcsdx", "title": "AITA for not leaving an equal share of inheritance to my step children as my biological child in my will.", "selftext": "I (55M) married my wife (52F) two decades ago, bringing with her two children from her previous marriage (27F, 30M). We also have a child of our own (19F). I am the primary breadwinner, my wife has always been SAHM to raise all three children, and since they have left, continues to run the house, and I am more than happy with this arrangement. Most of our joint assets therefore came from my income - wife came to the marriage with no assets.\n\nWe are aware that wife's ex-husband has had a windfall of inheritance money (as conveyed by my step children). This means that my step children are set to inherit that windfall if not squandered. Their paternal grandmother and other family members are still in the picture with possible inheritance that may yet be passed down. Conversely my biological daughter would not benefit from that inheritance money, and would only benefit from whatever inheritance I can give her (no other relatives in the picture that could support her or leave additional inheritance money).\n\nI have therefore chosen (with support from my wife) to will a larger portion of inheritance to my biological daughter. For example, if my wife and I died in an accident tomorrow, we would be leaving about $900K in assets to 19F, and $25K each to 27F and 30M. 19F would have no family support thus relying entirely on the inheritance money, whereas 27F and 30M will still have other family members that can support them. If ex-husband died tomorrow, 27F and 30M are likely to receive $250K each in assets, if not more, and will still have us to help support them when needed, as we currently do.\n\nWhen we discussed this with 27F and 30M, emphasizing that they are set to receive inheritance from ex-husband, and potentially others on his side of the family. They determined this was unfair, that my assets should be split evenly between 19F, 27F and 30M. I retorted that if their father died, would 19F get any of that inheritance, and they said no, because he is not her father.\n\nTo be fair, they do look up to me, and consider me as a father-figure, even though I am not their father.

How is that different from them and you? They are being greedy OP. You can tell because they think it's unfair when you do the exact same thing to them that they want to do to her.", "NTA as long as you base your argument on their windfall from their biological family and not on the fact that your wife was a SAH wife. Presumably, she did domestic work that often goes uncompensated and would have cost you a lot more if you needed to replace her sacrifice with a housekeeper, babysitter, and cook.", "NTA. It's your money. You can give it to OJ Simpson if you want. I think the strategy that you and your wife have decided upon is very equitable. I would do something similar in your situation.", "NTA. They\u2019re being obtuse on purpose. If they can understand why their bio dad would not leave anything to their half sister, then they should understand why YOU would leave more to her than to them. Life isn\u2019t always fair, but you have to make the best decisions you can to protect the people you love. Sounds like they\u2019d be taken care of either way, so not sure why they\u2019re acting up. Greed is a horrible thing.", "NTA. But I see no reason why you ever should\u2019ve discussed it with the 3 kids in the first place. You and your wife are in agreement, why ask the kids for their opinion, especially since you\u2019re only in your 50s", "NTA. You're giving your bio daughter an equal opportunity for financial stability as her half-siblings. That's your job as her parent.", "NTA. \n\n\nLike you said she not gonna have anybody to support her especially financially. You could\u2019ve left them nothing but you decided to leave them more than enough.", "NTA. They\u2019re being greedy. Labeling you as family but not their sister as a reason to why they are entitled to the inheritance is flawed logic. You should leave them 10K only. Your youngest will be disadvantaged.", "You are right with your math. Because they have their resources lined up for them.", "These are always so tough. I get that you want to do right by your daughter, but they're feeling like you're not treating them as your children. I don't know your family dynamic, but I know a lot of stepkids feel left out. \n\nI would suggest potentially splitting it more equitably, but perhaps not 1/3 each", "NTA i would give them each a dollar after having them argue for more money", "NTA not at all.", "NTA - it is up to you to gift your possessions to who you please. I hate to say this, but your kids sound a little greedy. They should be happy to respect your final wishes.", "NTA because it is your and your wife\u2019s money. But I do feel the split is lot equitable. You should not factor in what ex\u2019s family is giving them. Who knows what is in the will or not. His family can squander it and be left nothing. \n\nThat said if you and your wife are a true partnership why not spilt it 50/50 with your wife. Your 50% goes 100% to your daughter and your wife\u2019s portion gets divided 3 ways. Since essentially she has 3 kids. To me that is more fair. Leaving a token gift of 25k while other kid gets close to 1 million to me is insulting. Again take ex\u2019s family out of the picture as what they do with their money doesn\u2019t matter as they are not family to you. I\u2019ll be honest if I was the kid in that situation I would be extremely hurt and may go NC.

Enough money to buy a house and still have enough left over that the remainder could be invested into an ETF and gain enough to completely fund her retirement....Versus enough money for a new, lower-end vehicle.\n\nThat's just too much of a difference. It's a slap in the face to your stepkids, in my opinion. And sharing this information with them just seems cruel. I can't blame them for being upset. I'm not arguing it needs to be equal, but this just makes it seem like you're giving them a small, token amount just so they don't put up a fuss about the will or try to dispute it. I think you need to reconsider how the money is being divided, especially if you actually do care about your relationship with your stepchildren.", "NTA - you made the mistake of letting them know, so now you can look forward to resentment for the rest of your life. 25k seems low, but it's your money. But - they will think about this all.the.time. like when you need care when you are older. Maybe just spend it all before you die and solve the problem.", "NTA - and why do people discuss their will and inheritance with children? It's none of their business until you are gone and it's inappropriate to make it a group discussion where people often feel entitled and don't care if someone else is getting screwed over.", "Nta for now and if wife is on board. \nHowever - without her being SAHM for years taking care of the majority of the home work, you wouldn't have all those assets. So it is more fair that you ensure she has some \"her savings\" that she can leave to whomever she wants. Assets you acquire while she supports you are joint assets. You both may still feel that a high % to youngest is best as older kids have other people who can support. But soft y.t.a for the way you are treating the money like it is all yours and none of it is wife's to discuss the plans of or distribute. \n\nShe may also want to change the will later and be willing to discuss as her being home has supported that wealth accumulation. \n\nI am the youngest by 10 years. When I was a similar age I was aware that my mums had more money got to me than my older siblings as I was about to need to move many hours away to attend university and they were already established. Later, after I finished uni and was mid 20s the will changed to split everything evenly.", "NTA", "ESH.

Then when they split the 500k from their father IF they get any, it would give them each 400k?", "You have been these kids father for over 20 years.

One is age-related ie university, wedding, down payment assistance which have already been given to your stepchildren but not yet to your daughter.

This is so subjective; would you readjust if bio child had a far more lucrative career than the others, or married into serious wealth, or won the lottery? Like many others, I think an unequal split could be justified but your current ratio is not.

First, with such a wildly unbalanced distribution, you ensure that the 2 older kids will resent the youngest & never speak to her again. She\u2019ll have money & no family. Second, you don\u2019t know anything for a fact about the ex-husband\u2019s will or how much money he\u2019ll have left when he dies. He may get sick & spend all his money on healthcare. He is only in his 50\u2019s, right? He might marry again, have more kids & leave all the money to his new wife & kids. He might leave everything to his new wife, which is a pretty common thing for married people to do. \u201cIf not squandered\u201d is a pretty big if. The rest of his family might fall on hard times & he might spend his money helping them out. Finally, when it comes to inheritance, many people see the way their parents divide their money as a referendum on who they loved the most.

I think if you are gonna talk about it, it\u2019s still best not to use numbers so they aren\u2019t counting on a certain amount of money if it ends up being less.", "Your also making a massive assumption that they will get anything from their bio dad and his family which may very well never happen. There could easily be no money, or they could upset the family in some way and recieve nothing. How would you feel if you found out that after you were gone your daughter ended up with a cool million and your step kids only ever got that 25k?\n\nThere is also the massive disparity between the 900k for your daughter the the 275k you are assuming you and their bio dad are going to leave each of them, but you seem to recognize that.\n\nRemember that once your gone they are the only family your daughter will have left and the unfortunate truth is that how you handle your will may very well be the deciding factor on if there is any relationship there after your gone. Leaving that kind of disparity reeks of golden child and that child is often alienated and cut off by their siblings, and your decisions now will affect that.\n\nNAH, it's your ans your wife's money to do with as you will, but your gambling on your kids futures (and yes they are your kids too, you have been raising them since they were 10 and 7), and if someone were treating me as less because they assume someone else will make up for it I would be pissed as hell too.", "Nobody is entitled to an inheritance and OP can divide up the money however they want for any reason, but you can\u2019t pretend this is \u201cfair.\u201d Doesn\u2019t matter what bio dad is leaving the stepkids, the current set up is either asking OP\u2019s wife to favor her youngest or else it is minimizing her contribution to the household. OP and his wife have been married twenty years- likely his peak earning years. His career has benefited from his wife taking on the bulk of the childcare and household labor. The money earned during that time is just as much his wife\u2019s as it is his. It makes the most sense for her half of that money to be split equally between her three kids. Youngest still gets most of the money that way. It does not sound like any of them will be hurting for cash, anyway.", "Do you believe they will both get an additional $875,000 in inheritances, help towards new vehicle, and wedding gifts? So basically $1.8M coming towards your step kids?"]}
