Seriously a lot of red flags", "Thats called vigilantism and is illegal. Even if they wanted to be private detectives they need to be licensed. NTA\n\nAlso while I do agee WITHIN REASON that attractive white women are let off for things other demographics are not, they should really look into stats about financial crimes, fraud, and tax evasion. Part of the reason there arent as many women incarcerated for those crimes is because theyre less likely to commit them. A study actually found that out of 1,342 white collar criminals, only 14% were women and of those 14% the majority were pretty crimes. Now this of course in part has to do with opportunity. Due to gender disparity in the work place the majority of people in a position of power to commit major white collar crimes are white men. So really if your bf wants more women jailed for financial crimes he should fight for more gender representation in the financial space lol", "Yikes this isn\u2019t how to solve the sexist sentencing gap - NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

WTF?", "That's what I thought.", "No I agree the things you mention here sound like actual men\u2019s rights issues along with the emotional repression in the original post. My main issue is your post makes it seem like the group is focusing and actively pursuing just actions against women instead of actively trying to help men. Does the group have any plans to pursue the other issues in such a way that isn\u2019t just attacking women(not physically but I can\u2019t think of better wording.)\n\nEdit: advocate was the word I couldn\u2019t think of.

It just makes them sound really pathetic and undermines what good they could be doing in the other areas you mention.", "That's insane. You realize how crazy that is, right?
