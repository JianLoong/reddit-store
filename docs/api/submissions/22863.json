My boyfriend get easily frustrated with his Mom for the things that she does. For example she can be a hoarder when given the chance and for not getting things done (she does not really make things happen she just wants things to fall into her lap). When they are together he just gets angry and nasty with her (I think he also blames her for the situation with his Dad/unresolved childhood trauma). Anyways I am an introvert and work from home, I am one of those who needs to recharge their social batteries (if you know you know). \n\nMedically speaking the Mom is of sound body and mind and has always held a full time job. Currently she has been living with another family member for over 25 years. Due to some changes she is basically going to be kicked out because the family member is fed up of taking care of the Mom. The Mom has access to untapped financial benefits through the VA but she just gave up trying to get them because \u201cthey never called her back. She also collects SS all from her late husband (his Dad).\n\nAnyways my BF and I rent a 2B2b apartment and I am the only one on the lease working towards saving for a home. There are many opportunities for the mom to purchase a nice retirement hoa trailer for a decent price but again no motivation. I have tried speaking to my boyfriend about us all working ahead of this incoming storm and he just gets angry and says there is nothing he can do its his mom and he is not going let her be homeless. \n\nI see fundamental differences. My bf grew up in a multigenerational home and I did not. My concerns are as follows:\n1) we are not married. This is not my job to support her when she needs no medical care.\n2) the vibes from how he treats his mom makes me uncomfortable. It creates terrible energy. Ive always treated my home as a relaxing oasis and as an introvert I shudder at the fact of sharing my home with essentially a roommate. \n\nI have tried on multiple occasions to talk to him about helping her look for a home and I get shut down and told that its always my way for everything and that he can never have anything of his own in the house and I never compromise. But flat out I made sacrifices to get where I am today I refuse to take care of a grow. A** women for non medical reasons.

Your bf has also made clear he does not respect you enough to include you about a decision that will have a huge impact on you. I am actually really sympathetic to the bf that he doesn't want his mum homeless but his refusal to thoroughly discuss all options and aspects of how this will work, expectations and contingency plans when it isn't going well is a disaster in the making even if everyone was on board. If he refuses to act as a team before MIL has moved in when you have some leverage, it is going to get much, much worse once that leverage is gone.\n\nIt is actually irrelevant if OP is an AH or not.
