He works full time but he's also an amateur actor, which is his true passion.  I've seen him in a couple small community plays since we've been dating, but he's always had smaller parts.  Recently, he landed a leading role in a play put on by a much larger local production company and I couldn't be happier or more proud of him.  He's very excited about it too, obviously.  \n\nThey've been rehearsing 3-4 nights a week for almost a month now and opening night is set for 3 weeks from this coming Friday.  He's been working his butt off and I can tell how much this means to him.  But I started noticing that he was coming home from rehearsals reeking of cigarette smoke.  Now, my BF doesn't smoke and if he did we wouldn't be together because I have severe asthma and smoking is a huge trigger.  \n\nSo, I asked him about it and he said that some of his castmates smoke, but that there is also smoking in the play.  He said the director wants to be as authentic to the source material as possible and some of the characters smoke cigarettes throughout the play.  I honestly didn't even think that sort of thing was allowed anymore, but apparently our state allows indoor smoking if it's part of a play or performance as long as there are written statements on any advertising and promotions.  \n\nI asked my BF how much smoking is in the play and he said it's not constant, but it's quite prevalent.  I asked him if they plan to have any performances that are smoke-free and he said not that he's aware of.  I asked him if that's something he could talk to the director about and he said it's not his place to question the creative vision of a director.  I told him if that's the case, I won't be able to come watch it because of my asthma.  \n\nHe immediately got defensive and starting trying to reason with me by saying that the theatre is pretty big and well-ventilated and he doesn't care if I sit way in the back as far from the stage as possible, he just wants me to be there.  I told him I can't risk jeopardizing my health and that it's not my fault that his director is so behind the times that they are putting on a play that allows for indoor smoking.  It's 2023, why is that even a thing anymore?\n\nI told him that I would obviously come support him if there wasn't smoking involved, but I can't risk damaging my lungs.  I told him that I would of course come and watch the next play he's in and he snapped \"But what if there isn't another play?  What if this is the last leading role I get?  Tomorrow is promised to nobody and this means a lot to me and it would mean even more for you to be there.\"  \n\nI told him he's being dramatic and that my long-term health is more important to me than a play.  I do feel bad that I won't be able to see him act in his first leading role, but it's not worth it to me to be around indoor smoking for 2 hours.", "created_utc": 1683145426, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136yecs/aita_for_not_attending_a_play_that_my_bf_is_in/", "score": 1289, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Secondhand smoke is indeed dangerous, but your understanding of what secondhand smoke really is seems wildly out of touch. Your refusal to speak to your doctor to at least gauge the seriousness makes me think you don\u2019t take your bf\u2019s accomplishment very seriously.\n\nIn all honesty, if you are as sensitive as you are claiming, you would live in a hermitic environment, because regular pollutants would trigger your asthma.", "YTA enjoy the breakup", "YTA\n\nYou have quite confident expectations.\n\n> I asked him if that's something he could talk to the director about\n\n>his director is so behind the times that they are putting on a play that allows for indoor smoking.\n\n>It's 2023, why is that even a thing anymore?\n\nOf course smoking in general is unhealthy, but a short-term exposure of cigarette smoke is not a big deal for most healthy adults. \n\nCompared to other means of entertainment (circuses, all sorts of sports, stunts in movies, car races, etc), a short period of spoking is quite unproblematic when it comes to health risks.\n\nSo I think your expectation of \"this shouldn't even allowed\" and \"the director should change his ways for me\" is not fair.\n\nThat being said, of course you shouldn't risk your own health for a play, and if cigarette smoke is bad for your health, that's a priority.

I think you severely overestimate how bad this is going to be. It is not a small pub full of smokers and no ventilation. It\u2019ll be like one cigarette on the other side of a well-ventilated room meant for hundreds of people, which you can leave at any time. I highly doubt this will have any effect on you. This really seems like you are overreacting and not even trying to entertain any type of compromise - in the comments you have refused to talk to a doctor, wear a mask, etc. Perhaps your asthma is really that bad and your doctor will agree with you - but then you can at least tell your boyfriend that you have tried and have your decision backed up by medicine.", "INFO\n\nIs the director Nathan Fielder?", "Yes, YTA.", "YTA, and you know it.", "YTA, and I honestly feel sorry for your boyfriend.

Being in a large theater for 2-3 hours with a small amount of cigarettes is hardly a severe health hazard. lol. You have to have the most severe asthma in the word in order for this to effect you in any significant way. We're talking about a few cigarettes here. You won't be sitting on top of the people smoking sucking it in. Sit in the back, wear an 95 mask, go outside during intermission and for the love of god - chill out. And I can't believe you had the audacity to tell your boyfriend to talk to the director. Holy moly. Your boyfriend spent weeks of hard work and you say this is his passion? Getting a leading role is a HUGE deal for an actor. You not being there to support that because GASP A CIGARETTE! is ridiculous. YTA.

It\u2019s unfortunate that there is smoking in the play, but he can\u2019t control that. You CAN control where you sit, whether you wear a mask, whether you bring an inhaler with you, etc. It must be very hurtful to your boyfriend that you aren\u2019t even considering the possibility of seeing him act in one single scene of his leading role because of this idea you have in your head that the smoking *might* be too much for you despite any precautions you may choose to take. You seriously couldn\u2019t have told him you\u2019d go to the play and see what happens, even if that means leaving at intermission? I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be glad you saw him act and maybe you could come see the second half the next night. The compromises here are endless and your selfishness is really showing.

He's allowed to feel hurt and unsupported (I probably would too, to some extent), but he's consistently pushing back against your boundary and guilt-tripping you.  You did suggest one potential option (talking to the director) which he shut down immediately for what I personally think is a bs excuse.", "NTA.

I understand his excitement regarding a lead roll. I am set off by just a drift of smoke into my home via the window if someone is smoking, grilling, or burning outside. It doesn't matter how large the venue is there is the likelihood I will be set off by cigarette smoke rather quickly. Most likely, even \"stage cigarettes\" that burn cloves or something would set me off. So, I understand your stance on this. On the other, I would personally attempt sitting by an exit and wearing a mask to see my hubby perform; however, I understand not wanting to take the risk.\n\nOh, and for an asthma attack the smell of cigarette from clothing is very different than inhaling cigarette smoke even in very small amounts.

It makes sense to me that your BF doesn't want to ask the director to change around his show for one specific guest, and it makes sense to me that you don't want to attend this show.

If they say no, then it is what it is; if they say yes, you can give it a shot and leave if you feel uncomfortable.", "NAH I can understand him being disappointed and hurt that you won\u2019t try any options. However, if you truly think you can\u2019t handle it it\u2019s best not to go.

I would hope in a large theater it may not be as noticeable, perhaps you should go see it and determine if they will have any ventilation running while they are allowing the smoking.

He works full time but he's also an amateur actor, which is his true passion.  I've seen him in a couple small community plays since we've been dating, but he's always had smaller parts.  Recently, he landed a leading role in a play put on by a much larger local production company and I couldn't be happier or more proud of him.  He's very excited about it too, obviously.  \n\nThey've been rehearsing 3-4 nights a week for almost a month now and opening night is set for 3 weeks from this coming Friday.  He's been working his butt off and I can tell how much this means to him.  But I started noticing that he was coming home from rehearsals reeking of cigarette smoke.  Now, my BF doesn't smoke and if he did we wouldn't be together because I have severe asthma and smoking is a huge trigger.  \n\nSo, I asked him about it and he said that some of his castmates smoke, but that there is also smoking in the play.  He said the director wants to be as authentic to the source material as possible and some of the characters smoke cigarettes throughout the play.  I honestly didn't even think that sort of thing was allowed anymore, but apparently our state allows indoor smoking if it's part of a play or performance as long as there are written statements on any advertising and promotions.  \n\nI asked my BF how much smoking is in the play and he said it's not constant, but it's quite prevalent.  I asked him if they plan to have any performances that are smoke-free and he said not that he's aware of.  I asked him if that's something he could talk to the director about and he said it's not his place to question the creative vision of a director.  I told him if that's the case, I won't be able to come watch it because of my asthma.  \n\nHe immediately got defensive and starting trying to reason with me by saying that the theatre is pretty big and well-ventilated and he doesn't care if I sit way in the back as far from the stage as possible, he just wants me to be there.  I told him I can't risk jeopardizing my health and that it's not my fault that his director is so behind the times that they are putting on a play that allows for indoor smoking.  It's 2023, why is that even a thing anymore?\n\nI told him that I would obviously come support him if there wasn't smoking involved, but I can't risk damaging my lungs.  I told him that I would of course come and watch the next play he's in and he snapped \"But what if there isn't another play?  What if this is the last leading role I get?  Tomorrow is promised to nobody and this means a lot to me and it would mean even more for you to be there.\"  \n\nI told him he's being dramatic and that my long-term health is more important to me than a play.  I do feel bad that I won't be able to see him act in his first leading role, but it's not worth it to me to be around indoor smoking for 2 hours.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019m very sensitive to cigarette smoke and people smoking on the other side of an outdoor patio at a restaurant (like 30-40 feet away) is regularly enough to trigger a headache for me.", "Are you kidding me? The last asthma attack I ever had was just from walking into my Nana\u2019s house because she was a smoker. She hadn\u2019t even been smoking at the time. The air in her house was just so saturated with smoke, it was in the walls, in the carpet, everywhere. I literally had to walk right back outside because I was sent into an asthma attack just from how the house reeked of smoke. Your mother is doing a disservice to your father by smoking inside the house.", "If your mother is a smoker, then you are almost certainly too used to the smell to reliably tell.  I can absolutely tell if someone smoked upstairs in a house, if I walked in downstairs.  If someone smoked onstage at a Broadway theater, I\u2019d certainly be able to tell.  The community theater must *reek* after weeks of rehearsals.", "Damn it - you're allowed candy cigarettes? They're banned over here.", "Yeah SMELL. The SMELL from 20+ feet away won\u2019t cause an asthma attack, especially in a ventilated area. What causes an asthma attack is the actual inhalation of smoke. \nI work at a hospital and part of OUR OSHA compliance kit for spills of toxic chemicals is the N95 mask", "Yes I have, and I know for a fact with an N95 mask literally 20ft+ away from the stage in a well ventilated area I would not have to worry about it. Having an albuterol on hand would also lower the chance of needing to be hospitalized", "She said it\u2019s a much bigger one and since it\u2019s not constantly being smoked in and it\u2019s a well ventilated area then I highly doubt it would build up over the course of a month", "Are you a physician? Severe asthma can absolutely be triggered by secondhand smoke. It's harmful to make false claims.", "OP is literally saying it would be a problem. She knows her medical history better than you do, don't you think?", "Sry to destroy this happiness again. But in Germany there are drug tests. I had to take one for my job", "Yes because smoking a few cigarettes on stage in a massive theatre once is tooootally the same as smoking inside with no ventilation for years. \n\nDo you even read what you write?", "Can only get them from Dollarama. I've never smoked a day in my life thanks to them (I'd be a stress smoker otherwise)", "I was there a few years ago in Broadbeach when I was a smoker (I quit) but I remember having to buy a pack there and it was $40 and the pack was decorated with multiple photos of black lungs with the words \"danger\" in red. I looked at them in horror. Still smoked them but it made me very uneasy and slightly scared. They absolutely should do that too in America.", "It\u2019s okay bud, we all know our own bodies best. I can only share my experience as someone who has asthma and has been around varying levels of cigarette smoke an can attest to severe sensitivity.\n\nBut what is smell if not inhalation of particles?\n\nAlso, with the chemicals we worked with we would be lucky to survive to make it to a hospital after exposure. So that\u2019s why our gear was more intense.\n\nHope you have a great day", "That's great that you would not have to worry about it. Sounds like OP is. OP is still nta for protecting her health.", "idk some people are allergic to weed lmao", "Same here. Sitting next to a smoker, with it hanging on their clothes and hair, is enough to set me off. If she could be in that close proximity with him and be fine, it is not the big deal she is making it out to be.", "Unless you\u2019re licking his clothing, you\u2019re not gonna get anything from 3rd hand smoke. \n\n3rd hand smoke is a real concern, but it\u2019s not airborne. It\u2019s settled pollutants. It can be harmful to children because they touch and taste everything, but you\u2019re not gonna get an asthma attack from smoke that isn\u2019t there.", "What about 4th hand smoke", "Second hand smoke can\u2019t cause an asthmatic reaction if op is wearing a mask in the back of a theater. It\u2019s just not gonna happen. If they were that sick, they wouldn\u2019t be able to go outside.", "They have been smoking all over that theater for weeks.  It will reek before the curtain goes up.", "I loved those things. Like, they don't have to be in cigarette format, they tasted great!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthey had \"chocolate\" ones too. They were.. not great.", "We pioneered a bunch of those rules.\nWe just announced vapes are getting the same treatment. \nAlso nicotine vapes are prescription only.\nWe have a huge unregulated black market atm, but are cracking down on it.", "Canada is also like this.", "Just so wild to me.\nLove little differences, though don't like being around cigarettes tbf. Smell like arse", "We know our bodies best but we also know to at least try for our loved one. Have a good night", "I\u2019m also curious, why would a person with severe asthma that they can\u2019t handle smell of smoke work with toxins?", "I imagine it's just more likely that the cast already smokes, in which case going out to buy the herbal smokes would seem redundant.", "Yeah, as an asthmatic you are 100% wrong. We can go outside; we just bring inhalers with us and hope that we don't get too triggered by cigarette smoke. I bring an inhaler, cough drops, water and honey packet everywhere I go.  I would never actually willingly expose myself to cigarettes like that, or a room that has been smoked in for weeks on end while they're rehearsing for a play. Imagine coughing and trying to breathe through a small straw, that's how it feels for us to have asthma attacks. That risk is not worth going to a play. You guys just don't understand.", "Are you a physician?", "Oh, I'm sorry I forgot to put the \ud83e\udd23 to show I was goofing", "Because there was no smoke in my work environment, only steam in some outdoor areas, and the toxins were only dangerous if there was an accidental release. Smoking was actually prohibited on the premises to prevent potential explosions, so it worked out to be in my favor\n\nI never inhaled anything that ever affected me, and there are routine and intense air quality reports", "Maybe, but like... You have an audience to think of too when you're directing. The reasoning is dumb and thoughtless.", "Nah all good mate.\nYou're a good egg", "The amount of people who would be turned away by 3-4 people smoking in a theater of reasonable size is negligible. Portrayals of suicide will drive some people away from plays, should directors not adapt Romeo & Juliet?"]}
