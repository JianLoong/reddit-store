He works full time but he's also an amateur actor, which is his true passion.  I've seen him in a couple small community plays since we've been dating, but he's always had smaller parts.  Recently, he landed a leading role in a play put on by a much larger local production company and I couldn't be happier or more proud of him.  He's very excited about it too, obviously.  \n\nThey've been rehearsing 3-4 nights a week for almost a month now and opening night is set for 3 weeks from this coming Friday.  He's been working his butt off and I can tell how much this means to him.  But I started noticing that he was coming home from rehearsals reeking of cigarette smoke.  Now, my BF doesn't smoke and if he did we wouldn't be together because I have severe asthma and smoking is a huge trigger.  \n\nSo, I asked him about it and he said that some of his castmates smoke, but that there is also smoking in the play.  He said the director wants to be as authentic to the source material as possible and some of the characters smoke cigarettes throughout the play.  I honestly didn't even think that sort of thing was allowed anymore, but apparently our state allows indoor smoking if it's part of a play or performance as long as there are written statements on any advertising and promotions.  \n\nI asked my BF how much smoking is in the play and he said it's not constant, but it's quite prevalent.  I asked him if they plan to have any performances that are smoke-free and he said not that he's aware of.  I asked him if that's something he could talk to the director about and he said it's not his place to question the creative vision of a director.  I told him if that's the case, I won't be able to come watch it because of my asthma.  \n\nHe immediately got defensive and starting trying to reason with me by saying that the theatre is pretty big and well-ventilated and he doesn't care if I sit way in the back as far from the stage as possible, he just wants me to be there.  I told him I can't risk jeopardizing my health and that it's not my fault that his director is so behind the times that they are putting on a play that allows for indoor smoking.  It's 2023, why is that even a thing anymore?\n\nI told him that I would obviously come support him if there wasn't smoking involved, but I can't risk damaging my lungs.  I told him that I would of course come and watch the next play he's in and he snapped \"But what if there isn't another play?  What if this is the last leading role I get?  Tomorrow is promised to nobody and this means a lot to me and it would mean even more for you to be there.\"  \n\nI told him he's being dramatic and that my long-term health is more important to me than a play.  I do feel bad that I won't be able to see him act in his first leading role, but it's not worth it to me to be around indoor smoking for 2 hours.", "created_utc": 1683145426, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136yecs/aita_for_not_attending_a_play_that_my_bf_is_in/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to sit far away with an N95 mind you). Secondhand smoke is indeed dangerous, but your understanding of what secondhand smoke really is seems wildly out of touch. Your refusal to speak to your doctor to at least gauge the seriousness makes me think you don\u2019t take your bf\u2019s accomplishment very seriously.\n\nIn all honesty, if you are as sensitive as you are claiming, you would live in a hermitic environment, because regular pollutants would trigger your asthma.", "YTA enjoy the breakup", "YTA\n\nYou have quite confident expectations.\n\n> I asked him if that's something he could talk to the director about\n\n>his director is so behind the times that they are putting on a play that allows for indoor smoking.\n\n>It's 2023, why is that even a thing anymore?\n\nOf course smoking in general is unhealthy, but a short-term exposure of cigarette smoke is not a big deal for most healthy adults. \n\nCompared to other means of entertainment (circuses, all sorts of sports, stunts in movies, car races, etc), a short period of spoking is quite unproblematic when it comes to health risks.\n\nSo I think your expectation of \"this shouldn't even allowed\" and \"the director should change his ways for me\" is not fair.\n\nThat being said, of course you shouldn't risk your own health for a play, and if cigarette smoke is bad for your health, that's a priority.

This is clearly really important to him, and if I was in your shoes, that's what I would do.", "YTA \n\nYou called your boyfriend dramatic, but claiming that seeing this play would put your long term health at risk is ridiculous and absolutely dramatic. Being in a large ventilated room, sitting far from the stage puts you at no more risk than just walking around outside would.

This play obviously means a great deal to him, it's something he's deeply passionate about and there are ways you can very successfully and safely mitigate your risks.

I think you severely overestimate how bad this is going to be. It is not a small pub full of smokers and no ventilation. It\u2019ll be like one cigarette on the other side of a well-ventilated room meant for hundreds of people, which you can leave at any time. I highly doubt this will have any effect on you. This really seems like you are overreacting and not even trying to entertain any type of compromise - in the comments you have refused to talk to a doctor, wear a mask, etc. Perhaps your asthma is really that bad and your doctor will agree with you - but then you can at least tell your boyfriend that you have tried and have your decision backed up by medicine.", "INFO\n\nIs the director Nathan Fielder?", "Yes, YTA.", "YTA, and you know it.", "YTA, and I honestly feel sorry for your boyfriend.

Being in a large theater for 2-3 hours with a small amount of cigarettes is hardly a severe health hazard. lol. You have to have the most severe asthma in the word in order for this to effect you in any significant way. We're talking about a few cigarettes here. You won't be sitting on top of the people smoking sucking it in. Sit in the back, wear an 95 mask, go outside during intermission and for the love of god - chill out. And I can't believe you had the audacity to tell your boyfriend to talk to the director. Holy moly. Your boyfriend spent weeks of hard work and you say this is his passion? Getting a leading role is a HUGE deal for an actor. You not being there to support that because GASP A CIGARETTE! is ridiculous. YTA.

It\u2019s unfortunate that there is smoking in the play, but he can\u2019t control that. You CAN control where you sit, whether you wear a mask, whether you bring an inhaler with you, etc. It must be very hurtful to your boyfriend that you aren\u2019t even considering the possibility of seeing him act in one single scene of his leading role because of this idea you have in your head that the smoking *might* be too much for you despite any precautions you may choose to take. You seriously couldn\u2019t have told him you\u2019d go to the play and see what happens, even if that means leaving at intermission? I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be glad you saw him act and maybe you could come see the second half the next night. The compromises here are endless and your selfishness is really showing.

You won't be smoking, and sending a tinge of smoke scent in the air is not equivalent to inhaling smoke.\n\nJust give it a try, with the mask and the last row, inhaler handy, and just step out if you need to.

He's allowed to feel hurt and unsupported (I probably would too, to some extent), but he's consistently pushing back against your boundary and guilt-tripping you.  You did suggest one potential option (talking to the director) which he shut down immediately for what I personally think is a bs excuse.", "NTA.

I understand his excitement regarding a lead roll. I am set off by just a drift of smoke into my home via the window if someone is smoking, grilling, or burning outside. It doesn't matter how large the venue is there is the likelihood I will be set off by cigarette smoke rather quickly. Most likely, even \"stage cigarettes\" that burn cloves or something would set me off. So, I understand your stance on this. On the other, I would personally attempt sitting by an exit and wearing a mask to see my hubby perform; however, I understand not wanting to take the risk.\n\nOh, and for an asthma attack the smell of cigarette from clothing is very different than inhaling cigarette smoke even in very small amounts.

It feels like that! Not telling you OP but to whoever is reading this thinking you\u2019re the Asshole.", "NAH. It makes sense to me that your BF doesn't want to ask the director to change around his show for one specific guest, and it makes sense to me that you don't want to attend this show. I think you should talk to a doctor about whether you have any options for attending safely. If they say no, then it is what it is; if they say yes, you can give it a shot and leave if you feel uncomfortable.", "NAH I can understand him being disappointed and hurt that you won\u2019t try any options. However, if you truly think you can\u2019t handle it it\u2019s best not to go. I would consider a mask and sitting in the back, but again if you feel that\u2019s going to trigger an asthma attack, you have to do what\u2019s best for your health.\nI don\u2019t have asthma but I am extremely sensitive to smoke, and being around it will trigger allergy attacks and I will be sick for several days after. I would hope in a large theater it may not be as noticeable, perhaps you should go see it and determine if they will have any ventilation running while they are allowing the smoking. Which is insane to me, they\u2019re acting, they could pretend with unlit cigarettes or stage cigarettes.", "NAH - I wouldn't go either not worth the headache or days of vomiting that will follow.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He works full time but he's also an amateur actor, which is his true passion.  I've seen him in a couple small community plays since we've been dating, but he's always had smaller parts.  Recently, he landed a leading role in a play put on by a much larger local production company and I couldn't be happier or more proud of him.  He's very excited about it too, obviously.  \n\nThey've been rehearsing 3-4 nights a week for almost a month now and opening night is set for 3 weeks from this coming Friday.  He's been working his butt off and I can tell how much this means to him.  But I started noticing that he was coming home from rehearsals reeking of cigarette smoke.  Now, my BF doesn't smoke and if he did we wouldn't be together because I have severe asthma and smoking is a huge trigger.  \n\nSo, I asked him about it and he said that some of his castmates smoke, but that there is also smoking in the play.  He said the director wants to be as authentic to the source material as possible and some of the characters smoke cigarettes throughout the play.  I honestly didn't even think that sort of thing was allowed anymore, but apparently our state allows indoor smoking if it's part of a play or performance as long as there are written statements on any advertising and promotions.  \n\nI asked my BF how much smoking is in the play and he said it's not constant, but it's quite prevalent.  I asked him if they plan to have any performances that are smoke-free and he said not that he's aware of.  I asked him if that's something he could talk to the director about and he said it's not his place to question the creative vision of a director.  I told him if that's the case, I won't be able to come watch it because of my asthma.  \n\nHe immediately got defensive and starting trying to reason with me by saying that the theatre is pretty big and well-ventilated and he doesn't care if I sit way in the back as far from the stage as possible, he just wants me to be there.  I told him I can't risk jeopardizing my health and that it's not my fault that his director is so behind the times that they are putting on a play that allows for indoor smoking.  It's 2023, why is that even a thing anymore?\n\nI told him that I would obviously come support him if there wasn't smoking involved, but I can't risk damaging my lungs.  I told him that I would of course come and watch the next play he's in and he snapped \"But what if there isn't another play?  What if this is the last leading role I get?  Tomorrow is promised to nobody and this means a lot to me and it would mean even more for you to be there.\"  \n\nI told him he's being dramatic and that my long-term health is more important to me than a play.  I do feel bad that I won't be able to see him act in his first leading role, but it's not worth it to me to be around indoor smoking for 2 hours.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I Understand where you are coming from\u2026I used to be so sensitive to chemicals, especially artificial fragrances, that I was no longer able to work; I was not able to shop in stores or go to gatherings Without risking a severe reaction.  Trust me, you have to make the effort for the ones you love\u2014even if you have to step out during BF\u2019s play, you need to be there and wish him well beforehand and be there to congratulate him after the performance\u2026watch as much of the performance as you can until the smoke gets to you.", "INFO. Curious, is this play being open about the smoking and letting others know in case they have asthma or any other breathing issues while attending?\n\nEDIT: NTA", "Esh, sounds like yall need to learn some compromise.", "Reminds me of the Mitch Hedberg bit where he did a joke on smoking to make it part of his act so he could legally have a smoke during his act.", "It would depend on how bad your asthma is. I have asthma, and yes, all smoke bothers me but not to the point of a serious attack, just to where I need my inhaler. Do you go to bonfires cause I feel the smoke from them actually is worse than smokers. \nDo you play sport, do you still live your life. \n\nThere are some asthmatics that will make their asthma their whole identity to the point they aren't really living. But the doctor told me most asthmatics can still do sports, run around, and live their best life it's all about how you handle it.", "You really needed to ask?", "YTA you want him to talk to the director, but you won\u2019t talk to your doctor. You want him to have the play altered just for you, but you won\u2019t wear a mask. You aren\u2019t willing to try, at all. You\u2019re being selfish and dramatic.", "YTA for this and for your defensive replies to rational suggestions. This is not the place for you.", "YTA. Yet another person who posted something just to hear themselves type. You\u2019re taking such a ridiculous position. Do you never travel to cities? Check every building you enter for mold? Never enter a place that has recently used cleaning products?

How big is the theatre, how\u2019s the ventilation, shit like that. \n\nBut\u2026this is the guys first leading role. Take some inhalers with you and see it. And take your other inhalers a little more frequently a day or two before and after.", "I'm getting serious \"I can't breathe in a mask\" vibes from OP. Maybe I'm just a cynic after working through the pandemic, but come on. Smoke is used in productions all the time, theaters are designed to have proper ventilation for it.\n\nOP is definitely TA, considering they're unwilling to talk with a medical professional, wear a mask, or make any other attempts to see the show in any way.", "She said he came home smelling of smoke, but that second hand smoke didn't cause an attack and she was in the same, presumably smaller, room with him.  It's doubtful sitting in the back row of a huge, well ventilated theatre with a mask on would affect her at all. The fact that she won't even consider this, or ring her doctor and ask about it, won't even entertain the thought, yet expects her bf to go talk the director into doing a smoke free performance just for her makes her TA.", "I was in an extremely low budget play over ten years ago that had very convincing fake cigarettes. I do think OP is being unreasonable about this in general, but I also question why there needs to be real cigarettes.", "I believe OP is questioning as to why Indoor smoking is still a thing rather than smoking in general", "This is exactly what my BF told me to do and he's mad at me that I'm not even entertaining this idea.  Not worth it to risk my health to even try.", "lmao this was the exact question i thought of", "I have severe asthma and was a smoker for 20 years. Inhaler in one hand, cigarette in the other - stupid yes but I was an idiot. My dad is a severe asthmatic and lived with my mom who was a smoker. My sister is a severe asthmatic and could sit in a car with me while I smoked. I understand the complications of smoking around an asthmatic but her sitting in a back row, wearing a mask in a spacious theater while a hand full of cigarettes are smoked in a well ventilated theater are highly unlikely to make this chick rush to the hospital. If that was the case I doubt she could ever leave home or a bubble with the amount of toxins in the air on any given day. Second hand smoke for great periods of time over the course of time is 100% bad for you. Nobody is denying that. In this particular situation she is being 100% dramatic. She will be there for about 2-2.5 hours. She won't die. She can easily go and if the smoking actually triggers an asthma attack then she can leave. Everyone I know with asthma, myself included, don't just get attacks out of nowhere. There are warning signs before you get one. Her body will tell her ahead of time if the smoking is actually too much for her delicate lungs.", "Seriously not to mention secondhand smoke???? WTF is going on with the Y T A people?", "NTA obviously", "Agenda? lol. I shot a movie last year in which our actor smoked on screen. The actor who played the part isn't a smoker. Our director wasn't a smoker. It was simply a creative choice he made for the character. In fact, out of the crew of about 100 people only 2-3 people were smokers. Just because you choose to do something creatively doesn't mean you have an agenda. lol. Oh my.", "My BF said he's still very new to this and doesn't feel comfortable talking to the director about something like this because he doesn't want to \"ruffle anyone' feathers.\"", "If both sides are correct then shouldn't it be NAH?", "Oh boy, I suppose I could try to do that.

That's the one.", "So like in South Park with Rob Reiner in the diner fake coughing to complain about a guy smoking.", "Agreed. The reality is she doesn\u2019t even need the mask, I just think if it made her more comfortable with the situation than it\u2019s a good solution. I definitely am of the opinion that we all come into contact with smoke/pollutants all the time and there\u2019s levels of such that are safe for the vast majority of people, even those with asthma. My state has wildfires and \u201cdangerous to sensitive groups\u201d levels are still quite a bit of smoke in the air.", "Yeah theatre professional here wondering about that too. Rules are obviously different wherever they are but in my country the venue wouldn\u2019t allow that and I\u2019ve never seen anything but herbal or otherwise fake smokes used in productions.

YTA.", "I am saying this as someone with bad asthma that is hugely triggered by smoke. Is it possible for you to go and the leave the second you actually feel any actual effects from the smoke? Like I don\u2019t think you\u2019d have an asthma attack the second you\u2019re exposed to any amount of smoke (I know I wouldnt) and you should be able to tell \u201cthis is a bad situation and I need to remove myself\u201d before any damage to your health is done. Then you could either sit in the lobby, go outside, or leave altogether. That\u2019s what I personally would do in the same situation. You\u2019re not required to stay the entire play.", "You\u2019re behaving a bit like a drama queen to be honest. If not have you ever spoken to a doctor about hypochondria?

Guess what- YES YTA!!", "You are just being difficult and it's obvious.  You are arguing with everyone that is saying the same thing, why even bother asking if  you are the asshole?\n\nWearing a mask and sitting in the back is less risky then walking down the street and passing a smoker.", "If your asthma is currently under control and effectively treated, you gotta at least try\u2026", "I also have severe asthma and I smoke occasionally.  If she is having that serious of problems around second hand smoke she needs to seriously consider a different medication.  My preventative inhaler keeps my asthma down unless I stop taking it every day.", "I'd remind your BF that you're not the only person in the world with asthma, I'm sure there will be other audience members  who do not want to deal with cigarette smoke. If he's not willing to compromise and at least bring up your concerns with the director, then he shouldn't expect you to willingly put yourself in a situation that's dangerous for your health.", "There are a whole host of alternatives that look real that are used on Broadway and in professional theatres. \n\nI understand your BF may be new to this, but these are unsafe working conditions. And if this director is choosing \"art\" over safety in this scenario, I worry what other ways this director is making unsafe choices for their actors and their community.\n\nI'm genuinely surprised that a theatre company is willing to take the risk to use real cigarettes on-stage. Or that a venue would even allow it. This is something that would need to be included in the advertising for the play ahead of time.", "Don\u2019t hide it. Tell him you want to see his performance and want to ask about it. The promotional materials are providing advanced  notice of the hazard, so as an uninvolved person, you want to clarify if you can do so safely. That way he isn\u2019t confronting the director, it\u2019s just a question from a member of the public. \n\nHe might not want you to ask in case he is in future productions with this director and have him know the two of you are together and wonder why your boyfriend didn\u2019t just ask.\n\nI suppose videotaping the performance isn\u2019t an option?", "This is such a horrible idea. But you already don't give a shit about the play so I don't even know why you'd bother. \n\nIf you really couldn't handle being in the back of a theater with a mask where a couple people are smoking on stage, then you shouldn't even be able to leave your house.

There are plenty of options for her to choose from but she's a tad bit nutty so she won't do them. I don't know why she bothered to post when she's already so anti. She thought that because this is 2023 (lol to that line) that everyone would praise her. She's definitely not getting the results she thought she would.", "In that same vein, the BF has not tried to compromise either. He won't even entertain the idea of even bringing up OP's concerns with the director. I don't think it's fair for the BF to ask OP to put themselves in a dangerous situation for a show. Yes it's important to him, but OP's health should take priority.", "No, I don't need to talk to my doctor to know it would be a bad idea.", "Sorry, I\u2019m not the OP I was just copying and pasting what they had already put in the post about their asthma", "It absolutely could be. They smoke in mad men because it\u2019s critical to the show. They smoke in stranger things for the same reason. Fake cigarettes look hella fake like middle school production fake and for tv anyway it\u2019s too costly.", "lol a director is not going to change their play because a potential audience member demands them to. now if there was a petition or something, then i could understand them caving to the pressure. but a single person..highly unlikely", "If it was really that \"dangerous,\" she wouldn't leave the house because I guarantee you the air outside is of a worse quality than a well ventilated theater from the back row.

It's not a bad idea.", "This makes YTA, not willing to talk to your doctor about if there was anything you could do it make it safe (sit in the back, wear a special mask, etc). I have asthma that\u2019s pretty well controlled with my twice daily maintenance inhaler but I\u2019m very allergic to nicotine.  Even outdoors I can\u2019t be near people smoking nicotine or I will start coughing really bad and if I don\u2019t leave I will have a full blown asthma attack that would result in EMS being called. I have to hold my breath when walking past a smoker.

Do you walk around in a bubble?", "Switching from real cigarettes to stage cigarettes for one night will not change the entire plot/meaning of the show.

I'm just pointing out that if people want to rag on OP for not comprising, they should also keep in mind that OP's boyfriend hasn't tried to compromise in the slightest.", "lol ofc OP isn't going to drop dead from breathing in something besides oxygen. But an asthma attack isn't just a cough, it can be fatal in certain situations. It's just weird to me that someone would ask their SO with a chronic lung disease to sit in a room with second hand smoke for 2+ hours without even trying to compromise on their end.", "Expected everyone to just agree, I\u2019d guess. We get plenty of people who come here and are floored that it\u2019s not an echo chamber.", "Because OP is TA lol", "I honestly don't blame the BF for not requesting the director to change his play. It's his first major acting gig. OP could simply wear a mask and sit far from the stage, but she is refusing to. I would think someone with asthma this severe would WANT to wear a mask in public, or is already doing so, but she refuses to.", "Even if he doesn't want to ask the director to switch to stage cigarettes for one night, what about asking if there's an option to live stream the show? The theatre company could still charge tickets for people to watch, and that would draw in more audience members, especially those who want to avoid a smoke-friendly show. There are solutions to this. Someone just has to bring it up.", "The reasonable solution is that people who are highly sensitive should stay home... or wear a mask. I don't have much sympathy for folks like OP who are anti-mask but want everyone else to accommodate them. Especially when we're not talking about people being in close proximity in a very small space like a car or bar, we are talking about a large theater, with ventilation. It's not as if she's going to be right next to a character taking a drag in a few scenes.", "Honestly, I think the real asshole here is the director for having his actors smoke real cigarettes when stage cigarettes work just as well. It's completely unnecessary"]}
