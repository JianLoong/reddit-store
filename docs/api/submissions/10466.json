It is clear MiL is a malign influence on Evie, but *you allowed all of this to happen*. You allowed her to keep giving her lavish gifts, you allowed her to take Evie on trips, you allowed MiL to influence your young daughter to an extreme degree. And you allowed her to live with you, and keep living with you even though you did not like how she was behaving with your daughter. You are the parents, you allowed this to happen. I think the will is the least of your problems, and it speaks volumes that that is your main concern.", "After reading all your comments\u2014 you\u2019re totally the AH here. YTA", "Yta.

There's so many layers and I feel like there are probably other sides involving your conduct. For starters, Evie clearly has her own mental health concerns that have nothing to do with the MIL. It sounds like you're blaming the MIL entirely for the mental health concerns, and that's not a reasonable conclusion. \n\nNo one is entitled to someone's estate once they pass on. I'm not sure your retaliation was justified, but at the same time, it's your house and you can do with it what you please.\n\nYou seem very convinced that the MIL has poisoned the waters with Evie, but based on what you've shared, I'm not sure how that would be the case. It feels like you're angry that the MIL gave your child extra attention and advocated for them. It feels like there's conflicting opinions over how to help Evie. It might help to remember that you're all supposed to be on the same team - Evie's team. It's not a competition over who loves the child more or can do more for them, and I get the feeling that you might feel some jealousy over your MIL's relationship with your child. \n\nOther than the supplements issue (which is a super weird story that I'm not entirely sure I buy your narrative of), I'm confused what you feel the MIL has done that put your child in the hospital. I think you need to come to terms with the fact that your child is unwell and it's not any one persons fault. That child needs all the support they can get, and it's time to figure out a plan to help them together. In-fighting amongst isn't going to solve anything and will likely worsen the situation.", "NTA, she can take her toxic self elsewhere.

How does a 10 year old get turned against their own mother? I\u2019m so confused.", "NTA. your MIL sounds like she is narcissistic. I say this because my mother was a covert narcissist and did many of the things you are describing. She would constantly change her will according to who was basically kissing her @$$ at the time. She would leave her updated will out so everyone could see how she had it changed. She favored certain grandchildren and would ignore the others. So many other things I could mention but very similar to your MIL. My mother was extremely toxic and I had to save my mental health by completing cutting her out of my life. Now if indeed your MIL is narcissistic, she will not change and only get worse. Yes, i believe you are doing the right thing. You need to protect yourself and your children.", "YTA. True, MIL's singling out one kid for favoritism sucks, but you're a lot worse.  You & your husband are the parents. You have complete control over what access other adults have to your kids. You didn't put a stop to anything that MIL did as long as she was pushing gifts & money towards your family. You accepted expensive gifts including the second unit on your property and all of the stuff MIL gave one of your kids.  However, the moment MIL stops sending money your way, by changing her will, that's the bridge too far? Whatever problems your kid has that resulted in her needing in patient therapy are not going to be helped by your blaming MIL for them.", "NTA, i see some comments are are making it about the money, this is really about the MIL overstepping her boundaries, I understand your husbands point of view because he wants to take care of both his mother and children, but he needs to make a clear line that his mother cannot cross some lines.  It sounds like MIL just doesn't believe in mental health.  I feel like everything can still work out by making sure she understands what's at stake, she sounds like she is a big part of Evie's life, she probably does think what shes doing is helping evie and that her spending money on her makes her feel better, but most likely does not help evie's condition. maybe do a family counseling session with all the kids, you, your husband, and mother in law to help her understand what she's doing isn't healthy. have her join in on some of the doctors visits to understand her medical condition, she needs to get Evie off this pedestal and understand her mental health is a real problem.", "ESH.  It was stupid to plan to have her live in your backyard.  Stupid of your husband to suggest it, stupid for you to accept it, and stupid for MIL to pay for it.  Obviously having MIL so close has been terrible for your youngest daughter's health.  And your relationship.   It makes sense to me to kick her out, regardless of her will.  You don't actually have a right to her money.

Your MIL was basically brainwashing Evie and she put the child's health at risk. I'd limited as much communication as possible with the grandmother. The way you describe it, the MIL only cares about one grandchild when she have four grandkids. Your child needs to deprogram from the grandmother. I think the child and you both need counseling. When it's time for family sessions, your husband needs to join, because he does not see how your MIL is damaging your youngest daughter.", "YTA.   An ADU will add up to 25% of the home's original value.   Plus - I read in one of the comments that MIL does daycare and cooking.

While I understand that you don\u2019t like the affect MIL has on Evie, you can\u2019t dictate who she will leave her money to - it\u2019s her money and she is entitled to donate the whole thing to a third party if she wants. Also you mentioned that she did pay for the unit she lives in, so even if you want to charge her rent, you should then be fair and deduct the money she paid for the building from the rent you\u2019re asking because in this scenario you literally had her pay for an extra unit and then kicked her out simply because you legally can.
