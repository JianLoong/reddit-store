Real estate agents get paid super well; make them work for their money.", "NTA, however, if you force them to replace it they will buy the cheapest, most cost effective option. Speak to your real estate agent and ask for sum of money instead so you can choose your own appliance. You don\u2019t want the crappiest, cheapest one they can find that will break next year.", "NTA.   It\u2019s on them to replace any damaged appliances.  I suspect the paperwork you all signed says as much.  \n\nNow with that said\u2026 I\u2019d avoid having them pay in full for a replacement appliance\u2026 unless you\u2019d be cool with the absolute cheapest thing they can find.  See if there isn\u2019t a better solution you can negotiate here.", "NTA\n\nYou mentioned directly to them and noted that the appliances was leaking, not functional. It was agreed to be repaired. If they do this for a living then they will check the next house better to avoid these types of issues. Just be careful as getting them to buy it will get you the cheapest option they can find. I would also go back to your agent and let them handle part of it.", "I don't think you are the A so I'm going to vote NTA but I think you need to communicate with your partner more. The partner needs to acknowledge their own role in this. Why aren't they keeping an eye on the account? It is just as much their responsibility as it yours.", "Info - What kind of costs are we talking and what appliance. Was the sale signed as new appliances or working? Did you sign the walk through check list and list the issue? Is this a private seller or through a company?", "NTA\n\nThis is why contracts exist. This is their responsibility per the terms of the contract. Business is business.", "Nah.  You are right that you were buying a working appliance. But it was an older refrigerator worth way less than a new one would cost.  \n\nI would split the cost with them to get a new one which should last you for many years to come.", "All they owe you is a used appliance, so them paying half is fair. YTA, unless you\u2019d prefer they buy you a used appliance on FB and put it in your home.", "People like you make business hard\u2026. You bought a house and it comes with costs!!

We had our agent speak to them in the past, but they were just supposed to be coming to fix the problem today, so the agent wasn't there.  They approached us directly after they discovered the extent of the issue.", "Excellent point!", "It's definitely something we would have discussed, but the entire conversation occurred before anything could happen and my partner only told me they felt guilty after it was finished.  Unfortunately there wasn't really an opportunity to discuss it privately while the sellers were present.", "Between $600 and $900.  I don't know the exact cost.  The description listed the appliances as working, but not new.  We listed the leak issue directly to them and their attorney and it was noted.  It's a private seller, but my understanding is that they are flippers who do this as their business.", "They promised \\*working\\* appliances. When I helped my parents buy, the inspection caught that at some point the entire HVAC system had been stolen. That was part of the property description; the sellers paid to replace it. They might not have to replace it with brand new, but they do have to replace it, or hand over the cash so OP can do so themselves.", "They didn't promise *new* appliances but they did promise *working* appliances. \n\nWould you care to explain why exactly you believe expecting people to honor their word is somehow unfair?", "In a perfect world, you would have delayed closing, as the seller has a huge amount of incentive to make sure you're happy before closing, but basically none after.  Call up your agent and see if they can help, but be prepared that if the seller doesn't want to play ball, there's very little you can do at this point in the game.", "As pointed out, they will inevitably purchase the very cheapest/lowest quality. I\u2019d go pick out a top of the line appliance, and offer to *then* go half. \n\nNTA. Also: They probably knew it was busted and thought they could get away with it.", "Flippers are notorious for bad work jobs. How was the inspection? \n\nPlease be on the look out for more issues and maybe keep their contact info if more problems arise.", "Inspection was pretty good overall.  It does seem like they generally did a good job.  They apparently just never turned this machine on.", "I\u2019ve seen inspections miss moldy subfloors that were disintegrating and from like 4 remodels ago and full of water. I\u2019ve also seen an inspection then 2 days later supply line bursts and floods for 4 days before anyone notices. \n\nInspections miss things all the time is what I\u2019m getting at.", ">It's a private seller, but my understanding is that they are flippers who do this as their business.\n\nThey're assholes. They're trying to screw you. They need to pay you out in cash, no splitting this or putting in cheap garbage. Your partner needs to get over feeling bad. The sellers needed to fix this before they sold."]}
