Plus, it good life skill to learn to cook.", "NAH. It\u2019s justified that you don\u2019t want to buy additional groceries or to cook two different meals. But your daughter is still young. I\u2019m guessing she made the switch to vegan for ethical reasons, and probably feels really passionate about her new cause, which teens are wont to do. She made this decision without thinking of the implications. She assumed you had extra grocery money and/or that cooking extra wouldn\u2019t be a big deal for you. She was shortsighted. Talk to her and tell explain yourself again. Remind her that you will teach her some things. I think she\u2019ll come to understand you.", "NTA. She\u2019s 17, old enough to make the decision to become vegan, old enough to prepare, purchase, and procure her own food. She\u2019s more than welcome to what you make, you\u2019ve offered. But you shouldn\u2019t have to cook two totally separate meals.", "NTA\n\nIf she wands to be a vegan but she can't cook, then she's gonna have a really tough time of it when she moves out.\n\nVeganism isn't easy. She wants you to do the work for her so she can sit on her high horse without the effort of climbing onto it", "NTA - I did the same with 2 of my older teens when they decided to go vegan.  They were allowed to use what they wanted from the family pantry but I wasn't going out of my way to make a second meal or out of the family budget to get ingredients only 2 out of our 8 person household would be eating.  They could eat whatever I cooked and sometimes they did as I tend to cook plant heavy anyway, but I'm certainly not buying oatmilk for $5 for 46 Oz for 1/4 of the household. Eventually I had to amend the \"whatever \" portion of the family pantry to \"within reason \" as they occasionally would use up all of an expensive ingredient (like vanilla) on an experimental recipe they ended up throwing away and not replacing the ingredient.  Also, make sure she knows to wash ALL of the dishes, pots, and pans she uses. I can't tell you how many times I got stuck with a dozen or more additional dishes to wash because they \"had to get to work\". I told them to do them along the way and plan enough time to get it all done but at 18 and 19 they \"didn't have time\". They moved out and now they complain about each other not doing dishes because they live together lol. You do enough, let her get some life skills before she's on her own.\n\nETA - I did end up buying some stuff so the family could check it out except my husband and oldest son who staunchly refused. Our family liked the Seitan the most. Even though the ingredients are pricey and it takes a bit to make, if you make enough it can last for a few meals. Maybe try that with her, or a couple of other vegan meals the whole family might go for. In roughly a year of this the whole family tried maybe 5 dishes and I cycled through the different alternative milks available to see which would work the best for my lactose intolerant second oldest. He hated them all but the older ones go to try them. I got a different one each week. Different brands taste different too.", "I'm missing some INFO. What are \"vegan groceries\"? I guess you do not only cook meat, so she could still eat rice, pasta, vegetables etc. She might only have to add an additional protein source and i do not think it is too much to ask from her, to buy this herself.", "NAH. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s entirely unreasonable here, but I wouldn\u2019t call your daughter an asshole either. I think this is a learning opportunity. Our job as parents are to prepare our kids to fly the coop with a variety of useful tools and knowledge to succeed on their own.\n\nYou didn\u2019t disregard her lifestyle change, try to encourage her to give it up, or even refuse to teach her how to make healthy meals. I would say maybe try implementing some vegan meals a few times a week, and make sure she\u2019s present and involved in the meal. Then, when you decide to incorporate meat to the rest of yours\u2019 diets, she will have some experience and can make some meals for herself.\n\nWait until things are calmer and maybe explain the whole \u201clife skills\u201d route.", "NTA.  Shay is 17 yo and works.  The world will not change for her to be vegan.  If she wants to be vegan, it is fine for you to say that she needs to put out the effort to make it happen.  That's real world... she can make those decisions, but she has to make it work.  Expecting others to pay for it and do all the cooking makes her the AH.", "Easy NTA.\n\n\"said what if she didn\u2019t know how to make it\"\n\nShe's 17, she can't use that any more. If she doesn't know how, she learns, period. \n\nYou work full time, and cook at home, you're not a short order cook, you make the family meal and that's it.\n\n>She\u2019s also says her friends mom gets the groceries and cooks it for her friend. \n\nYeah, she's too old for this line too, \"but my friend's mom does x\" just doesn't cut it when you're 17.\n\nShe's acting like she's 10, not 17, just a pile of excuses why she can't so something for herself.", "NTA. Your whole family isn't obligated to follow and pay for her dietary choices.\n\nNow, I also don't think it would hurt for the whole family to do a vegan meal a couple times a month and maybe share in the cost for those. That could not only open the rest of you up to new experiences that you just might like, but it could also be a bonding time where you amd your daughter cook together instead \"I'll show you once, then you're on your own.\" (Though, I do think it's important for daughter to learn some self-sufficiency, too. Maybe on a weekend, you could go through a cookbook together and just talk about some recipes that look good and questions she might have about them, to build her confidence more if she's going to be fending for herself.)\n\nBasically, the rest of you don't have to take this journey with her, but you can help her on it from time to time. But also, yeah, she needs to understand that her decision comes with responsibilities that she might not like.\n\nEdit: I also think you both need to sit down and set ground rules and expectations on groceries. Like, if you buy carrots for the family, is she allowed to eat those carrots as a snack or use them in her vegan meals? Or does she have to stock her own entire vegan kitchen from top to bottom? Because THAT seems extreme. But if you want to say \"these are the products you have to buy yourself (excluding any hypothetical family meals)\" that's fine, I think. And even if you want to say \"these are some shared ingredients we expect you to *contribute* to since we'll be using more of it,\" I don't think that's necessarily wrong, given her age.", "NTA. She\u2019s 17 perfectly old enough to cook her own food, it\u2019s not an allergy it\u2019s a lifestyle choice nothing you cook is going to kill her it\u2019s not a fair comparison. Quite right to not want to cook 2 meals every night.", "NTA. She's 17, she works. She can pay for her own food as she won't eat the stuff you prepare. You do enough allready. She'll have to learn to cook (just as you did), or go live with her friends mum.", "NTA for not wanting to cook two meals. You're already doing a lot of work. But is it unreasonable for you to buy certain vegan ingredients? You have been paying for her food expenses up to this point, and as someone still living at home and dependent on you until now it is a bigger reach to have her pay for all her own food. Especially as she won't be \"costing\" you money in the non vegan food department anymore. Doesn't mean you have to go out of your way and buy tons of vegan stuff--I'm thinking grab one pack of beyond meat if you're buying ground meat, etc.\n\nI agree with you that she could eventually learn to cook vegan food for herself, and if this is something she's serious about, she'll have to learn at some point. But it may take her time if she has no cooking experience yet.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
