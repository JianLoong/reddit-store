Plus, it good life skill to learn to cook.", "NAH. It\u2019s justified that you don\u2019t want to buy additional groceries or to cook two different meals. But your daughter is still young. I\u2019m guessing she made the switch to vegan for ethical reasons, and probably feels really passionate about her new cause, which teens are wont to do. She made this decision without thinking of the implications. She assumed you had extra grocery money and/or that cooking extra wouldn\u2019t be a big deal for you. She was shortsighted. Talk to her and tell explain yourself again. Remind her that you will teach her some things. I think she\u2019ll come to understand you.", "NTA. She\u2019s 17, old enough to make the decision to become vegan, old enough to prepare, purchase, and procure her own food. She\u2019s more than welcome to what you make, you\u2019ve offered. But you shouldn\u2019t have to cook two totally separate meals.", "NTA\n\nIf she wands to be a vegan but she can't cook, then she's gonna have a really tough time of it when she moves out.\n\nVeganism isn't easy. She wants you to do the work for her so she can sit on her high horse without the effort of climbing onto it", "NTA - I did the same with 2 of my older teens when they decided to go vegan.  They were allowed to use what they wanted from the family pantry but I wasn't going out of my way to make a second meal or out of the family budget to get ingredients only 2 out of our 8 person household would be eating.  They could eat whatever I cooked and sometimes they did as I tend to cook plant heavy anyway, but I'm certainly not buying oatmilk for $5 for 46 Oz for 1/4 of the household. Eventually I had to amend the \"whatever \" portion of the family pantry to \"within reason \" as they occasionally would use up all of an expensive ingredient (like vanilla) on an experimental recipe they ended up throwing away and not replacing the ingredient.  Also, make sure she knows to wash ALL of the dishes, pots, and pans she uses. I can't tell you how many times I got stuck with a dozen or more additional dishes to wash because they \"had to get to work\". I told them to do them along the way and plan enough time to get it all done but at 18 and 19 they \"didn't have time\". They moved out and now they complain about each other not doing dishes because they live together lol. You do enough, let her get some life skills before she's on her own.\n\nETA - I did end up buying some stuff so the family could check it out except my husband and oldest son who staunchly refused. Our family liked the Seitan the most. Even though the ingredients are pricey and it takes a bit to make, if you make enough it can last for a few meals. Maybe try that with her, or a couple of other vegan meals the whole family might go for. In roughly a year of this the whole family tried maybe 5 dishes and I cycled through the different alternative milks available to see which would work the best for my lactose intolerant second oldest. He hated them all but the older ones go to try them. I got a different one each week. Different brands taste different too.", "I'm missing some INFO. What are \"vegan groceries\"? I guess you do not only cook meat, so she could still eat rice, pasta, vegetables etc. She might only have to add an additional protein source and i do not think it is too much to ask from her, to buy this herself.", "NAH. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s entirely unreasonable here, but I wouldn\u2019t call your daughter an asshole either. I think this is a learning opportunity. Our job as parents are to prepare our kids to fly the coop with a variety of useful tools and knowledge to succeed on their own.\n\nYou didn\u2019t disregard her lifestyle change, try to encourage her to give it up, or even refuse to teach her how to make healthy meals. I would say maybe try implementing some vegan meals a few times a week, and make sure she\u2019s present and involved in the meal. Then, when you decide to incorporate meat to the rest of yours\u2019 diets, she will have some experience and can make some meals for herself.\n\nWait until things are calmer and maybe explain the whole \u201clife skills\u201d route.", "NTA.  Shay is 17 yo and works.  The world will not change for her to be vegan.  If she wants to be vegan, it is fine for you to say that she needs to put out the effort to make it happen.  That's real world... she can make those decisions, but she has to make it work.  Expecting others to pay for it and do all the cooking makes her the AH.", "Easy NTA.\n\n\"said what if she didn\u2019t know how to make it\"\n\nShe's 17, she can't use that any more. If she doesn't know how, she learns, period. \n\nYou work full time, and cook at home, you're not a short order cook, you make the family meal and that's it.\n\n>She\u2019s also says her friends mom gets the groceries and cooks it for her friend. \n\nYeah, she's too old for this line too, \"but my friend's mom does x\" just doesn't cut it when you're 17.\n\nShe's acting like she's 10, not 17, just a pile of excuses why she can't so something for herself.", "NTA. Your whole family isn't obligated to follow and pay for her dietary choices.\n\nNow, I also don't think it would hurt for the whole family to do a vegan meal a couple times a month and maybe share in the cost for those. That could not only open the rest of you up to new experiences that you just might like, but it could also be a bonding time where you amd your daughter cook together instead \"I'll show you once, then you're on your own.\" (Though, I do think it's important for daughter to learn some self-sufficiency, too. Maybe on a weekend, you could go through a cookbook together and just talk about some recipes that look good and questions she might have about them, to build her confidence more if she's going to be fending for herself.)\n\nBasically, the rest of you don't have to take this journey with her, but you can help her on it from time to time. But also, yeah, she needs to understand that her decision comes with responsibilities that she might not like.\n\nEdit: I also think you both need to sit down and set ground rules and expectations on groceries. Like, if you buy carrots for the family, is she allowed to eat those carrots as a snack or use them in her vegan meals? Or does she have to stock her own entire vegan kitchen from top to bottom? Because THAT seems extreme. But if you want to say \"these are the products you have to buy yourself (excluding any hypothetical family meals)\" that's fine, I think. And even if you want to say \"these are some shared ingredients we expect you to *contribute* to since we'll be using more of it,\" I don't think that's necessarily wrong, given her age.", "NTA. She\u2019s 17 perfectly old enough to cook her own food, it\u2019s not an allergy it\u2019s a lifestyle choice nothing you cook is going to kill her it\u2019s not a fair comparison. Quite right to not want to cook 2 meals every night.", "NTA. She's 17, she works. She can pay for her own food as she won't eat the stuff you prepare. You do enough allready. She'll have to learn to cook (just as you did), or go live with her friends mum.", "NTA for not wanting to cook two meals. You're already doing a lot of work. But is it unreasonable for you to buy certain vegan ingredients? You have been paying for her food expenses up to this point, and as someone still living at home and dependent on you until now it is a bigger reach to have her pay for all her own food. Especially as she won't be \"costing\" you money in the non vegan food department anymore. Doesn't mean you have to go out of your way and buy tons of vegan stuff--I'm thinking grab one pack of beyond meat if you're buying ground meat, etc.\n\nI agree with you that she could eventually learn to cook vegan food for herself, and if this is something she's serious about, she'll have to learn at some point. But it may take her time if she has no cooking experience yet.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One is a health issue the other is the daughter's personal choice. Plus daughter is 17 and if she wants to create extra work for OP, daughter can handle it herself.", "There\u2019s a difference between a medical condition and a choice.", "Because one is a personal luxury choice and one is a health necessity. They don\u2019t compare. Also allergies can be accommodated without having to make two separate meals for everyone. You can just not add the one thing or have it on the side, but that\u2019s pretty impossible with veganism. It\u2019s all or nothing. Her daughter is 17, she\u2019s about to be an adult, she has a job. This is very reasonable.", "I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of grass out there she can pick and cook.", "I know you think you\u2019re doing something here but there\u2019s a world of difference between a legit medical issue that can lead to death and a personal choice. \n\n\nIf anything maybe mom can buy things like fruits and veggies that the whole family would use and anything special daughter could be responsible for and at 17. It\u2019s important to learn how to make your own meals specially, if you\u2019re deciding to do a specialized diey like being a vegan.\n\nNTA for the mom", "Not everyone can eat or afford vegan food. \nNTA. I think mom is absolutely right, if anything I'd argue that is up to the daughter to learn to make vegan food and convince the rest to try it, but not the other way around.", "17 is a teenager but not a baby. OP is supporting her personal choices but good parents teach their kids how to take initiative for things they want instead of expecting other people to handle it.\n\nOP still provides food just not the special ingredients that would create more work. Daughter is getting ready to move to the next part of her life. If she can't handle these minor responsibilities, OP will be blamed for not teaching her.", "Cooking the family meals is one thing that isn't her responsibility (finance wise) because of her choice of diet.", "Because then OP would be accused of parentifying her? \n\nNTA op. Your almost adult daughter needs to learn to cook.", "I pick out groceries everyone in the house hold will eat. My 15 year old is very picky and my 11 year old is allergic to like everything. I have a certain grocery budget, so if she\u2019d like to eat things that are specifically just for her I figured she could do it herself. I\u2019m not completely cutting her off, I\u2019m still getting snacks for the house, groceries, drinks necessities. I just asked of her to get the vegan products", "OP is 17. It\u2019s not unreasonable for her to expect her parents buy some of her food. Snacks, treats, extras, all on her. With OP (hopefully ) incorporating some vegan meals, that doesn\u2019t just pass the buck for all the daughter\u2019s groceries onto either side. It\u2019s not unreasonable to want your parent to provide for you either. And\u2026 kids are entitled by nature. Assholes? Sometimes. Is she an asshole? No. She\u2019s entitled. That\u2019s\u2026 pretty normal.", "We don\u2019t know that she wants to cook with vegan eggs, vegan butter, substitutes, etc. vegan milk products that can get expensive pretty quick. So if she\u2019s making vegetables for the family was better, she hast to make a separate portion without better. But I do agree that if there are things that can be shared with the family, they should share them.", "This is a good suggestion, I think. It\u2019s not as simple as \u201cjust don\u2019t add chicken\u201d. I cook enough to realize how many animal products are used as regular parts of recipes and sometimes the best replacement is the most expensive. In order to meet the complex nutritional needs that humans have, daughter will need more than just some beans and vegetables. It can add up pretty quickly and stretch a grocery budget that is likely already quite high given the ages of the kids. NTA.", "I've heard true veganism will rule out some ridiculous amount of food, even almost all fruit and veg due to the use of bees and pollination.  I don't think I'd have the patience to go vegetarian.  Vegan just blows my mind.\n\nAnd leather is another one, no more leather shoes, belts, jackets, no leather couches.", "From family meals! From being incorporated into family dinner. \n\nIf you were told to go make your own food, not hey that sounds interesting\u2026find some recipes to try out and I can give you a hand\u2026or this vegan thing is different, but I\u2019m willing to learn. C\u2019mon. Don\u2019t play naive.", "INFO: what exactly is she asking for? What meals do you normally cook - because making a separate portion without meat/dairy is not usually all that big of a deal.", "you do understand you now have to buy less meat, so that frees up part off that budget right? also the meat dishes contain vegtables who she can use by not putting them in.", "How is that different with dealing with a child who's a picky eater?\n\nShe's still your child. I'm not advocating you follow her shopping list or cook for her, but you should have food available for her to cook herself.", "She\u2019s still a minor that you\u2019re obligated to take care of. Clearly you are picking favorites. It\u2019s not hard to incorporate vegan dishes in your normal meal prep and grocery shopping trips.", "We don\u2019t expect 17 year olds to FEED THEMSELVES! Particularly if they live at home. YTA", "She is his dependant child.    \n\n\nHe has a responsibility to feed her.\n\n\nHow hard is it to provide vegetables?", "I understand how it is a personal luxury to someone that is not vegan. But for many vegans they see it as a matter of ethics.\n\nI\u2019m not a vegetarian, but I can still understand this from the other perspective. It\u2019s not that different than if someone served dog at your dinner table, or insisted on eating food from animals that were tortured - not very appetizing right?\n\nWell, most vegans believe there is not adequate animal welfare, and don\u2019t see non-vegan foods that differently from my examples.", "As a meat eater most meals I eat I could easily make vegan (or at least portion off some that was vegan) and I'd never dream of making a child fend for themselves if that was the case.", "Vegan food is just food without animal products. It isn\u2019t more expensive or something that requires convincing. I\u2019m not really sure what you have in mind that not everyone can eat vegan food, or why it is any less affordable.", "Honestly she might be pushing the boundaries, she is a teenager and can see the 15 year old getting preferred food with no allergies. If you can accommodate the 15 year old then you should her. This is simply in her mind why are you doing it for one kid with no allergies but not the other.", "She\u2019s your child. Ugh. Whatever. Do you and live with the consequences. Don\u2019t come asking for opinions if you just want to argue.", "How am I picking favorites? I have a grocery budget. If I have the ingredients she needs, she can obviously use them. But I am not buying full meals of stuff no one else will use. I also cover other necessity", "I'm not sure what type of household you lived in but at point does the life skill of cooking for yourself come up? Daughter is 17 and will be moving out soon - she needs to understand how to manage her own meals. OP didn't say daughter couldn't use any of the house groceries so she's feeding her. But daughter can't expect the world to accommodate her *personal* dietary choice.", "She probably wants the replacement items, like Beyond Meat or Daiya. \nVegan products aren't exactly cheap, and if it's anything like the gluten free market, you have to spend quite a lot of time and money trying different things in order to find something palatable.", "I was from a single mom household. Having two separate meals was never in the cards for us. Unless I wanted a can of spaghetti ohs instead of chicken tenders. This is larger than offering a side of veggies. It's not affordable to cater to a whole separate meal plan every day.", "Take a breather. OP said she can use the house groceries, the kid isn't starving. Only thing she would need to personally buy would be the special request items the daughter wants. So fruits and veggies are already provided. Although I hope you know veganism requires much more than Vegetables right?", "OP is feeding her. She\u2019s stating she WANTS to eat something else, but she doesn\u2019t HAVE to. She\u2019s more than happy to make dinner for her, but daughter doesn\u2019t want to eat it. If she wants a unique meal requiring groceries no one else will eat and needing technical skill to prepare, daughter can do it herself. Otherwise she can eat the lasagna like everyone else \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yeah yeah, most vegans also drive and wear shoes that aren't vegan. \nI'd say specially if it's an ethical voice, the teen should be proactive on learning to make their chosen foods.", "You should try it sometime, sounds like you've never had to actually cook vegan food for all meals, when you do, let us know how it goes.", "I never said two separate meals..... Its easy to make a meal and have a portion be vegan....\n\n\nYou're doing a roast? Keep the veg separate and separate some gravy before adding the meat juice!\n\n\n\nMaking bolognase? Saute the veg... Add everything but the meat....    Portion off some before continuing....\n\n\nIt's not hard to cater to your child!", "I agree they should have a role in this. I also think parents should take interest instead of offense in their children\u2019s interests.", "I can cook vegan quite happily alongside non vegan dishes thank you for the suggestion though!", "Yeah that takes extra steps, I think a better idea is for the 17 year old to learn how to sustain themselves cooking is a skill everyone should learn. Specially those who have to eat special diets. \nAnd that btw, is definitely not how you make Bolognese. Cooking has an order of steps for a reason, it helps flavors develop.", "We were just on different realms. I'm talking chicken tenders and spaghettios from an overworked an underpaid mom. I didn't get saut\u00e9ed veg or roasts for dinners. I got a can of corn as a side. It might not be hard for you to cater to a child but there are different perspectives.", "When I make bolognase I saute the onion, carrot and celery...... Add the herbs, garlic and pepper.... Then the mince.... \n\nOnce the mince is browned I add passata.... \n\n\n\n\nI'm not sure how hard it'd be to take a portion out before adding the meat in order to have a vegan option?", "The spaghetti and corn are vegan though.....\n\n\nIt's not hard to cater to a child who wants to be vegan...\n\nOK they don't get what everyone else gets every time. ..... But they shouldn't have to feed themselves!", "Spaghettios. Not spaghetti. I'm on the parent side of exhaustion. This is a 17 year old of 3 children? They're asking their child to take responsibility for their own meal plan. 17 yr old wants parent to provide fully vegan meals and pay for it. Complains how friends parent does this all and pays. The 17 yo needs to have some sense and not compare to other homes and capabilities", "In the UK spaghetti hoops are vegan I'm sorry I assumed that USA ones were also.", "I have no idea if they're vegan but I ate the meatball version. I'm more making a reference point to simplicity and cost. So I apologize if I misunderstood anything about being vegan."]}
