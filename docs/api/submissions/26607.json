I worked today and I did all the prep work/ cooking and cleaning so him and his friends could enjoy their time together.

Little background on our situation, he works full time (pays 60% of bills) and I work part time(40% of bills), therefore I deal with all domestic house duties. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love my role in our home and I truly am happy to do it. However, this just feels like straight up disrespect. I was super upset after him feeding me excuses of why he can clean up his own vomit, he smelt horribly of liquor and was starting to raise his voice at me when he was explaining he couldn\u2019t clean it because he \u201chad to go to work to pay for all the things we want\u201d. To be clear, we have our own individual bank accounts and he doesn\u2019t pay for any of my personal bills or recreational purchases. After his exudes of why not to clean it up, I didn\u2019t engage or continue with the argument because when you\u2019re sober there\u2019s no reasoning with a drunk person, so,  I had asked him to sleep on the spare room.

Or he can grow up and clean it himself.\n\nI once went to a company event with a guy. Knew a bunch of the guys there. My date said, \u2018woman, go get and make me a plate (buffet style). I looked right at him and said calmly that I would happily make him a plate of food. As I always do so for children. And if I make him one, I will treat him as a child. Or, he can make his own plate and I will treat him as a man\u201d. Everyone was stunned.

It is already nice enough of you to prep for his friends and their hangout, to also expect you to clean up because he doesn't know how to drink responsibly is NUTS to me. If he is making the conscious decision to drink like that, he is obliged to clean up after himself. Even if you handle most of the house duties, you are not a maid so don't feel guilty.

It's self inflicted, yes. But in the moment that's a lot like asking someone with a bad flu to clean up after themselves. They're really likely to say screw it and go lay down. And maybe regret how much worse the cleaning is tomorrow. But in that moment? Just puked, feel awful, must rest. That's probably as deep as it goes.\n\nYou're not TA but how I'd judge him really comes down to what he says and does about it when he is past the hangover phase. And you are pretty unrealistic. He's just seeking any excuse that lets him lay down and sleep it off. This doesn't necessarily mean anything about his philosophy on sharing responsibilities.\n\nThat's how it sounds to me. Probably a very mild NAH. If he gets past the hangover and is pissed at you that's another matter. Or if he wasn't done partying and he just went back to it and was up for a while feeling fine he's TA.", "ESH\n\nHe needs to get his ass in check.

He works 210 hours a month and she works 90. \n\nShe still has plenty of days off she keeps the same schedule as he does she literally still has 7 days off.", "Right. That\u2019s what she should be spending those 30 hours a week doing. Nothing you mentioned takes 120 hours a month to do.", "So then he can quit his 52.5 hour a week job and only work 22.5 hours a week like she does so that they have equal amounts of free time. \n\nAs it stands even if she does all the household duties she still has more free time than he does. \n\nIf they want to split household duties she should work on household stuff and extra 30 hours a week. Then they are both working 52.5 hours a week. Any duties on top of that can be split 50/50\n\nNo way should she be working 1/2 of a full time job and he works 1.3 full time jobs and they split the housework 50/50?\n\nY\u2019all insane.\n\nPs i don\u2019t subscribe to \u201cyours and mine\u201d money. The should pool it as a couple and make joint decisions. But if they are not going to, she should be paying 15% and doing all the housework.", "I also don\u2019t believe in married couples splitting the bills. I think the money should be pooled into \u201cour money\u201d and budgeted in an agreed upon manner. Because you are right that each partner\u2019s earning potential is supported by the other spouse. It is *their* money.\n\nIf they are going to play silly bill splitting games though she should be doing 100% of the housework and paying 15% of the bills. Any housework that takes more than 30 hours a week to get done (I am guessing none of it) should be split 50/50", "Very defensive because some one pointed out a small mistake you made, agreed with you and explained that as bad as you made it sound, it's actually worse. \n\nAre you okay? Like, sounds like some one having a terrible day", "I have bouts of nausea and sometimes the toilet makes it worse for me. idk why, but somehow trash can is easier for me to tolerate. (I also have purpose made barf bags like they have in hospitals. those work the best if you have them on hand. plastic grocery bag in a pinch.) nausea sucks!", "Oh goodness, that sounds like such a stressful state. I\u2019m so glad you have a partner who can help you through the various scenes that can happen in your life. I have uh\u2026 episodes very often (seeing a gastroenterologist) so I imagine it would be really hard for a partner to deal with that shit. My roommate puts on headphones because I\u2019ve asked for \u201cprivacy,\u201d but having a partner would be completely different.", "This sends me back to when I moved out for college. My roommates hated that I would just drop a chip or something and leave it there instead of picking it up. That was a really tough habit to break", "It didn't happen often enough.  So didn't seem necessary.\n\nIt was only when my youngest developed severe vomiting at age 10.  Then it became necessary.", "Same. I have one next to my bed and another by the sofa. I had to teach my (now) husband not to throw wrappers and rubbish in those bins when he moved in, because I put my face in there and getting tickled in the face with an empty bag of microwave popcorn when I\u2019m puking was unpleasant. I also didn\u2019t want the smell of something I enjoy to be associated with puking.", "Op has a job, pays only 10% less of half the bills, does 100% of the cleaning, so how is she not contributing? Why would 30 hours be so much of a hassle? It says it in the post the only financial contribution the husband does is 60% of the bills and all the other money is his to do with whatever he pleases. Op pays for her own recreational activities, her own personal bills, and still does everything previously mentioned on top of that. He can't sacrifice a few hours of his day off to help clean? \n\nWhat would happen to the poor man if he wasn't married. He'd have to pay 100% of the bills, do his own cleaning AND cooking, and still work his job", "Yeah but he isn\u2019t paying 100% of the bills, so she shouldn\u2019t be doing 100% of the house work (plus apparently taking care of his bodily fluids as an added bonus). You are saying the shit that you are saying just because she\u2019s a woman.\n\nEdit to add: The only thing he is contributing (at least) twice as her, is money to his bank account. He should try paying for the service she is providing by hiring someone and then we can evaluate how much does she really contribute (besides the bills she is paying).", "No, he is earning more than twice what she is.  He is contributing 60%.  It's right there in the post.", "Mental load, you sexist prick.", "And then if they have a kid....? Nah f this if he's already that petty about cleaning there's no way she'd want a kid with him. She'd be a full on bang maid at that point.", "It doesn\u2019t really matter what you or I believe. The reality is she pays probably a majority of her wages into their home while he keeps a majority of his wages for his personal use. And she does all the domestic work on top. It\u2019s not an equal exchange. He earns that much because he never lifts a finger to take care of himself. 50 of his hours are paid and he keeps most of that money. Half of her hours are paid and she spends most of that money on expenses, and the other half of her hours are free labor for his benefit. Fuck that.", "What exactly few hours of a day should he be sacrificing to do housework when he works 14 tens in a row?\n\nI agree if they do the \u201cyour money my money\u201d thing she should only be paying 15% but it\u2019s reasonable for her to do all the household stuff. \n\nIf there\u2019s any left after she\u2019s done 120 hours of housework a month then they can split it. But I highly doubt there is 4 hours of work a day 6 days a week of household work needing to be done. So she probably STILL has significantly more down time than he does.\n\nPs If he were single he probably would live in the barracks for his job and not have many personal household obligations. He likely has many more simply because he\u2019s married.", "I am absolutely not saying that because she\u2019s the woman (as also am I.) I\u2019m saying that because for 120 hours a month that he is at work she is not. So she can spend that time working. It should be more than enough to cover all the household duties.", "And she can do those in part of that time too. And still have at least 7 days off a week.  Plus you don\u2019t know that she has the mental load. He is paying most of the bills and working a very demanding job, I am sure that comes with its own mental load."]}
