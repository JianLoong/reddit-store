I have 5 bridesmaids, one of whom(25f) has been MIA throughout the entire wedding planning process.\n\nI really struggled between asking her or my sister in the bridal party. We used to be extremely close, but have drifted apart since she met her partner... but in the end I chose her as my sister and I are not super close due to a 9 year age gap and living 12 hours apart.\n\nShe found out she was pregnant in April, so I was trying to be understanding knowing that she was probably very overwhelmed and excited for her own journey. Then her and her boyfriend decided to get married and planned their own micro wedding in 2 months. This is fine - it's her life she can do whatever she wants and I'm happy for her.\n\nBUT - when it comes to stuff for my wedding, she has been completely MIA. She did not attend my bridal shower or bachelorette, and the other girls have mentioned she doesn't respond to any of the planning chats they have had. She was also supposed to attend my final dress fitting (the only bridesmaid who was and she ended up bailing so I went alone. I know she's busy, so I was trying to give her the benefit of the doubt - however, I think I am at my wits end now.\n\nShe ordered a dress with the group back in May, but when her dress arrived, she decided she did not like it. We have been trying to remind her to re-order for months, and she finally has, but now the arrival dates listed are after our wedding...\n\nI am a little frustrated, as it feels like she has just been completely disinterested in the wedding process... I know she is busy and has a lot going on, but I am feeling a total lack of care about the experience at all... I know weddings are silly in the grand scheme of things, and a dress really won't make or break the day and shouldn't make or break our friendship, but at the same time, I am seeing it as a symbol of her disinterest.\n\n...

The kind thing to do would be to ask her to step out & just attend as a guest. End your stress, her stress & just move on with your day.\n\nNo one needs to feel badly about this.

Being a bridesmaid does come with some responsibilities and you don't go into it thinking otherwise, so you would be within your rights. \n\nBut before jumping straight into it, maybe have a conversation about it. She may be suffering with her pregnancy. Her finances may be screwed. There could be any number of reasons why she's been MIA.

(this was also november 2020 when restrictions were being lifted but having multiple days off wasn\u2019t an option with my job). i still managed to make as much as i could, i went to every bridal event, every fitting i needed to be at, ordered a dress and had it tailored. cut her out of the wedding party but not the wedding. if the dress won\u2019t be there in time what does she expect to happen? she has to also account for how much more pregnant she\u2019s going to be in a month, and being two months from her due date isn\u2019t promising with her being too tired to actually do bridesmaid things at the wedding. she has her priorities and that\u2019s fine, but honestly it\u2019s shitty of her to have accepted and then been MIA. and to not answer the other bridesmaids is also shitty of her because they have to plan around someone who may or may not show up", "YWNBTA. It sounds like, for whatever reason, she doesn't have the right frame of mind to be an active participant in your big day. \n\nDon't wait until the 13th hour for to have a conversation with her about her new role. Ask her to lunch/coffee and see if there's anything going on. Maybe something else is happening in her life and she doesn't want to dump it on you because of you big day coming up? \n\nEither way, just tell her because of how busy you both have been, you want her to enjoy the day.", "NTA, she doesn't want to do it, her actions tell us that. You can last minute ask your sister, but you better really treat her well since she is a second choice replacement.", "Bridesmaids have two jobs: show up to the wedding on time and wear the dress selected by the bride. If she doesn\u2019t have the dress in time for the wedding then she can\u2019t walk down the aisle. She is welcome to attend as a guest. NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s an AH for being too non-confrontational. She was expected to order the dress when she was just a few weeks postpartum. I\u2019m sure you would\u2019ve understood if she had stepped aside.", "NTA for that, YTA because you acknowledge this whole thing is silly but are embracing it none the less. \n\nForgive your friend and let her go.", "INFO - has she had her baby yet?", "That is probably what she is waiting for.", "NTA- understandable that she didn\u2019t go to bachelorette (be it for $ reasons or if she was still pregnant) but she\u2019s TA for missing your bridal shower. That requires little to no effort on her part. I would certainly kick her out if I was in your shoes.", "No - she is due in December.", "NAH. Don\u2019t \u201ckick her out\u201d. Have a conversation with her about her lack of support and tell her you would understand if she steps down. If she insists she can do it, remind her of all the pre wedding events she missed and it\u2019s obvious that she doesn\u2019t have the time to be bridesmaid right now. Don\u2019t just tell her she\u2019s out of the wedding.

Having time to be a bridesmaid means getting the dress and showing up on the day. The other stuff is a bonus but not required.\n\nIf she's stressed with other things in her life, she may just want to be a guest and that's fine but you might not get the reasonable discussion in if you are keeping score of every wedding-related thing she hasn't done and she feels like you have unreasonable expectations.", "NTA kick her out. She doesn\u2019t care.", "YWNBTA. I would just try to be as calm and friendly about it as possible. If you come in hot or go off about her lack of effort she's more likely to get defensive. Maybe she wants to back out since she has so much on her plate and just didn't know how to tell you. In that case, this may be a relief to her.", "NTA but it would be nicer not to expel her because of a dress but to point out that you think its best for both of you if she only attends the cerimony or the party.

Say you'd rather she just be able to enjoy herself than have it cause her any undo stress. Ya never know what's going on with people, and sometimes they can't communicate it for whatever reason. I think you'd be doing her and yourself a favor by making it as easy as you can on the both of you.", "Definitely not ta at all, it\u2019s completely reasonable you feel the way you do, I know it seems like she has a lot on her plate but she simply does not care for you and your wedding. Her priority isn\u2019t you as she has her own stuff and she shouldn\u2019t be too upset if you uninvite her to your wedding if she hasn\u2019t participated or involved herself. Invite her as a guest instead as a bridesmaid because it\u2019s not clear she will be there for you in this special moment, what if she flakes out on your wedding? It\u2019s also the fact she\u2019s irresponsible with the dress planning so good luck op!", "Be honest and respectful it sounds like she bit off more than she can chew. Also pregnancy causes a thing called mom brain so she might not be doing this on purpose.", "Yeap. She can't even complain about it. But it has to be nicely asked. Don't ask for money or something that might put you, OP, in a bad light.", "\u201cToo non-confrontational\u201d? Seriously?", "Just like every one is saying... keep her in the back.
