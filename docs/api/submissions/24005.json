Since I met her she's been very competitive with me and gave pick me vibes. So the reason I'm typing this is I applied for a job walking distance from my house not even 6min away and they told me they'll let me know when I need to come in for training so I told Sam and our friend group how happy I was to hear they'll let me know when I can come in for training because I'm struggling to find a job with a good income  and because it's walking distance from my house that helped me a lot. Well the next day I got a message from Sam telling me she got the job that I wanted... I told her oh wow I'm happy for you and then came the message from the company saying I don't have to come in for the training anymore because they found someone else and obviously I knew who. So I then messaged Sam and said I don't understand how you got the job when they told me they'll let me know about the training and you knew I really wanted/needed it and you don't really need it? (She lives with her parents far away from the job and her parents pay for everything without complaining because her parents are really really wealthy and she's already had a job and her parents gives her allowance money) and she just replied well I wanted to do something in my spare time and felt bored so I decided to go ask for the job 3 times after you told me about it and also don't mention my name to the company ever because I told them about us being friends... so I just told her well I'm happy for you but also sad because I needed the job and the fact that you asked for the job knowing I wouldn't get the job and I have the qualifications for it (I studied for the job and had experience since I was 16) and she told me well you snooze you loose. Maybe you could ask them to be the cleaner ! So I decided to just let it go and go to sleep but then my boyfriends phone rang and he answered it and it was Sam crying that I apparently hurted her feelings and how she needed the job because she's bored and at least I can still be a cleaner and how I'm being a AH for not being happy for her so my boyfriend said whatever and just blocked her and I also blocked her. \n\nI also found out that she lied to the owner and said I'm lazy and will quit after a week ? \n\nAITA? Because I would've thought you don't go get jobs that your friends wanted?\n\n\u27a1\ufe0fUpdate: thank you for everyones advice, I decided to give up on the \"friendship\" because it's toxic. I actually scrolled through tiktok and saw a video saying everything happens for a reason and that you shouldn't give up just because people got the things you wanted doesn't mean you can't get them later. So I decided to look for another place to work and try to improve myself more by not getting emotionally invested to jobs. I decided to also try to get more qualifications by studying or looking for another job that will add more experience.

She will quit fairly quickly in my opinion. I would email the job, express your disappointment in not getting the role and ask that they keep you in mind should anything else come up because you are super enthusiastic and really qualified etc (lay it on thick but don't mention knowing the other girl or being in a hostile situation with her.) Make sure the job remembers you positively for when she leaves. It may work in your favour but keep looking for other work as well.", "Definitely NTA - Sam sucks and sounds jealous of you. She went after the job because you wanted it, not because she needed or wanted that particular job. Then she complained about you to your boyfriend, hoping for sympathy. Sounds like she's into your boyfriend. Glad he chose your side, as he should have.", "NTA but Sam is. She sounds majorly pick me and manipulative. Watch yourself around that one.", "NTA She not only went after the job, she's also going after your boyfriend. She called him crying in an attempt to manipulate him. She thought she could get him to defend her and thus cause problems in your relationship.", "NTA \n\nI mean, what could you have done wrong here? From what you\u2019ve said here, you\u2019ve attempted to keep peace with this girl that you don\u2019t care for. You applied for a job that you really want that\u2019s convenient and that you need. \n\nThis is a tricky situation because the person you need to talk to about Sam is your boyfriend. I\u2019m kind of curious his take on this situation actually. Is this characteristic of Sam? Is this a you thing or a personality trait? I wish I had more advice here, but I don\u2019t usually see this ending well. Either the boyfriend thinks you\u2019re jealous of the other girl and that ends up causing strife in the relationship or the boyfriend thinks you\u2019re putting him in a lose-lose situation of having to choose.\n\nOne thing is for sure, I\u2019d keep Sam out of the loop about future jobs.", "NTA, but if you are still generally interested in this job, maybe it would not hurt to make contact with them.  If she is only doing this because she is bored then she won't last too long.  I would reach out and say thank you for the opportunity to interview, you are disappointed that you did not get the role but wish them the best with the new hire who incidentally you have met recently and is a close a friend of your partner.  Tell them you would love to be considered for any future roles and remind them of the parts of your resume that demonstrate you have commitment and are reliable, attach referee letters and contact details.\n\nHopefully they will put 2 and 2 together and realise there is some pettiness going on here", "WTF\n\nSam's a two faced snake.\n\nNTA\n\nI am glad your boyfriend blocked her too.", "No, but the sooner you get over it and start looking for jobs far enough away so that something like a sleazy girl's slander doesn't touch your options, the better off you'll be. You can't tell me that was your only option, a place where they hired a lying backstabber?", "NTA for feeling how you feel, but just so you know, there is no rule that you can\u2019t apply for a job just bc your friend wants it. That\u2019s not a thing. I\u2019ve applied for jobs with my friends and we all got hired. If one of us didn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t have been a problem because that\u2019s kind of haterish. \nAlso, do you know the hiring manager at this company personally? How do you know she said you are lazy and would quit in a week? If you don\u2019t even know them & they go around blabbing like that, it\u2019s probably a toxic work environment anyways. Sounds like you dodged a bullet.", "NTA.\n\nKeep that horror blocked and ou of your lives!", "NTA.

Consider this move a warning.\n\nI would purposefully send her on wild chases. Tell her about the next activity or the next job that you are considering. Really emphasise how much it would mean to you to have that experience, and watch her try to get there first.\n\nRince and repeat.", "Thank you very much I'll definitely do that", "She definitely likes him but unfortunately for her and he made it clear to her he sees her as a friend and never will see her as more and I guess that's why she's competitive with me and wants the job I needed", "I suspect she 100% lied about OP to the company. That\u2019s why she told OP to not mention her name to the company.", "She's very competitive with all the females in our friend group and my boyfriend also dislikes it but we're a big friend group and some of the people in our group don't want to cut Sam out of the friend group because they've been friends very long with her and unfortunately, I was the new person in the friend group and can't expect everyone in the group to cut her out although I would've loved to and my boyfriend agrees but some men in the friend group don't want to and agree with everything she does or say in the group. In conclusion, I think me and my boyfriend should get another friend group without Sam and with the other females in the group and some of the men who know she's toxic. My boyfriend will usually tell me when I'm in the wrong and I'll tell him when he's wrong and I'm happy he agreed with me. It's honestly a difficult situation", "I initially thought the same but then re-read it and realised that OP was given the job, only for the employer to then give the job to Sam. Supposedly because she'd be a better fit? I don't think I'd want to work for that employer anymore if they treat people like that, doesn't show much integrity. Unless Sam lied about OP but then it would be hard for OP to either prove otherwise or make this right without creating a whole drama. It sucks OP lost out on the job but it might be better to move on. There just might be another, better suited job for her!", "I was going to advise the same thing.\n\nShe won't last long at that job and reaching out shows OP is serious and not at all like what Sam said. (Although it's not great that your potential employer did this!)", "Thank you very much. I'll definitely do that", "Thank you for your advice I appreciate it. Unfortunately, I live in a country where it's difficult to get a job with a good income and no it wasn't my only option I applied for a lot of jobs and didn't get it. I can't look for a job too far away because I don't have a car and I can't afford Uber everyday to go to work and yes there's people who I can ask to pick me up and drop me off everyday at work but no one will because I would live too far away from them", "I want to go visit the Titanic on a submarine!!", "If your boyfriend knew she liked him, why did he stay friends with her? Seems disrespectful to you.", "It really is. I think you\u2019re doing the best with how the situation is. Maybe just try to keep her as more of a friend that you don\u2019t confide in and try to keep those boundaries up because she\u2019s going to take advantage where she can. \n\nYour boyfriend seems like a good guy and it sounds like you have a strong foundation if you two can be so open and honest with each other. I really love that for you. \n\nI wish you the best of luck! \ud83d\udc95", "I agree, the employer is terrible for doing this and I personally would not bother with them, but I have different circumstances to OP.  It sounds like this is in an area that OP is interested in, and is very convenient for location, so if she is still keen on this role then this could be a way to get a foot in the door.  I don't know the industry it is in, but if it is niche, it could be beneficial to try to clear her name/reputation.  Sam 100% bad mouthed her.  Sam has a safety net in the form of a rich family but OP may not.  I am honestly 50/50 on this one, but like I said, it depends on the size of the industry and if rep is important", "Keep popping in from time to time as well to see if they have anything. When I was homeless, a man walking by told me he applied for his dream job 99 times and then got it. He worked there for 25 years before retiring. Keep going, and don't let her get you down, but also don't tell people anything anymore until you have to to stop this sort of thing.", "I agree she had feelings for him and confessed her feelings to him before we started dating. Unfortunately, we have a big friend group, and some of the people in our group the men (not my boyfriend) don't want to cut her out of the group because they've been friends with her since school", "He could be young and clueless.", "Thank you very much \ud83e\udd17", "Right. That doesn't mean he needs to stay friends with her and especially not for her to contact him. They can be part of the same friend group without being friends themselves."]}
