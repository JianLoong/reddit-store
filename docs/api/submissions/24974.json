{"id": 24974, "submission_id": "15urfxm", "title": "AITA for not posting photos of my wedding?", "selftext": "This might sound incredibly odd but I'm in a predicament and I can't tell if I'm being overly petty. I (42F) got married this summer. We paid for a small photographer package just to capture the key moments, so that meant it was mostly just some photos of the ceremony, and basic family photos. The photographer stayed a little longer as a favor and did a few shots of the reception of me and my closest girlfriends. I loved the photos when we finally got them back and I posted a photo of me and my new husband, and a photo of me and my best girlfriends on my facebook to share with everyone.\n\nShortly after that my MIL texted me asking if I planned to post anymore photos from the wedding\u2014I said no and asked why. She said that my husband's best friend's wife (Heather) saw my facebook post and was offended that I didn't post any photos of her. \n\nFor some context, Heather has known my husband's family for years. She and I attempted to be friends when I first started dating my husband but I never really grew to like her. She was very negative, liked to gossip too much, and I caught her on several occasions gossiping about me behind my back about how she didn't think I was a \"good fit\" for my husband. \n\nAfter that I told her that we needed more boundaries and I didn't want to interact with her anymore in social settings unless it was a large group get together. After that I hardly ever spoke to her again aside from some small talk at parties. \n\nDuring the wedding planning process Heather suddenly wanted to be part of everything, including my bachelorette party, and said she wanted to be a bridesmaid because she \"just adored\" my husband and wanted to be part of his special day. I politely declined and despite her complaining about feeling \"left out\" I didn't back down.\n\nSo fast forward to now when my MIL is making this weird request. I don't even know why Heather cares about this, and my MIL agrees that it's silly but said that I'm being petty because Heather is happy for us and I should \"play nice\" and show Heather some appreciation by sharing photos that included her. \n\nI said I wasn't going to do that and this was such an odd and unreasonable request for someone I wasn't even close friends with, and my MIL said Heather was very hurt by me \"excluding her\" from our wedding. I said I didn't care and the wedding day was about our families, not Heather. \n\nI told my husband and he said that he agrees that this is dumb but I should placate Heather since it won't hurt anyone to post photos of her too. I'm stubbornly digging my heels in and feel like everyone around me has regressed to high school age, and I'm tempted to post every photo I have from the wedding and deliberately remove the ones of Heather, but I feel like that's just me being petty. AITA here, or has everyone around me lost it?", "created_utc": 1692381270, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15urfxm/aita_for_not_posting_photos_of_my_wedding/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just ignore it - as much as it's tempting to be petty here it's clear that Heather has a vested interest in causing problems in your relationship and engaging with her would only be giving in to what she wants.", "Maybe I\u2019m feeling petty but I think you should pay to have heather photoshopped out of all of them. Put another head on her body. Act confused when she comments \u201cthat\u2019s my body.\u201d \n\nOk, that\u2019s insane, but it would be super funny. NTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRefuse to give in to this bullshit. Your MIL is an AH for even stirring up that kind of drama. Just ignore it.", "She sounds in love with your husband.  \n\nThat's where my head went first. \n\n\nI would ignore it. And tell your husband to stop being so docile. \n\nIt's none of Heather or  your MIL business on what wedding photos you posted.\n\n\nNta\n\nThis is why I don't do social media.", "NTA they are just feeble human beings incapable of needless drama", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding. They're your photos.\n\nThe age of social media has created these weird expectations that the bearer of group photos also holds a responsibility to post them in public -- and to do so in a way that considers everyone's preferences, even if they run counter to your own.\n\nIf you're looking for some kind of midway point, maybe you can directly send Heather the photos that include her. That way, if she wants to take it on herself to post them on her own account, she can. Idk why it is so necessary that you have to post on your own.", "NTA. It was your wedding and they are your photos, so its up to you on what to do with them. I might say you are being a little petty, but Heather sounds like somebody who just needs attention so I dont blame you for not wanting to feed into that, especially since its about YOUR wedding. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sucks when there is somebody really annoying and tangentially attached to your life but you cant do really anything about them.", "NTA and frankly, Heather sounds a tad stalkerish to me!", "NTA.  Whether or not Heather understands how you really feel about her, these are Your photos of Your wedding on Your social media account. If your MIL and husband thinks it's easier to give Heather her way, let them post pictures of this woman on their own social media pages.", "I would post the photos where Heater is caught off guard or isnt smiling etc. then say \u201cwell originally i didnt want to post them as they made her look bad but she insisted \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \u201c\n\nNTA", "NTA. I was going to post my petty action, but I saw it's already crossed your mind. Who on earth looks at wedding photos and asks why they're not in them. Heather sounds cuckookachoo.", "NTA, this is so weird. Post what you want.", "NTA. Heather is being ridiculous. \n\nBut she\u2019s your husband\u2019s friend\u2019s wife so I think you can make this his problem. After my wedding I shared pictures that featured them with some of my close friends and family. If your husband feels like it, he could send some of the pictures of his friend/Heather to them. Then she can post to her heart\u2019s content.", "Heather is a look at me girl. It sounds like she needs to learn that she is indeed not the sun and she doesn\u2019t get to tell you how to live your life. I really don\u2019t like narcissists. It sounds like your husbands family placates her too much. I would show your husband this Reddit with these answers. Because he really needs to decide who he is married to. NTA", "NTA. I\u2019d just move on and ignore the request as Heather will forget soon anyway. But if MIL brings it up just say you\u2019re done talking about it and change the subject. If she insists end the conversation.", "Why would she even be in the wedding photos?  NTA", "Yta, this is really a fight you wanna start? Honestly, just be low-key petty and only post photos that she looks un attractive in and move on.", "I try very hard to be a kind person. However, when the petty comes out .... It's usually pretty good. So, post some pictures of Heather .... Just a shame that she is 95% cropped out or do you have some lovely ones of her side or back? Why are they catering to this person? It's ridiculous. Main character syndrome runs deep. \nCongratulations on the marriage!", "> AITA here, or has everyone around me lost it?\n\nEveryone around you has completely lost it. No reason to give into this ridiculous demand and no idea why MIL would get involved here. NTA", "NTA And hey, here's an idea. Instead of telling the bride that she needs to placate a guest she's not even friends with, try telling Heather to placate the bride as it's her wedding, her photos and her prerogative to decide which photos to share. (Yes, I know they're also the husbands, but MIL doesn't seem to be bothering him about it.)", "NTA \n\nAnd I would shut this down regarding MIL and husband all wanting to make peace with Heather\u2026 \n\nIt is wild that your MIL even called you for this. I would block Heather from your social media so she can\u2019t see any of your posts.", "NTA. Don\u2019t post to pictures she may be stalking you or your husband or something it\u2019s hard to tell but don\u2019t plan to it and don\u2019t let your mother-in-law guilt you over it. She\u2019s absolutely in the wrong.\n\nQuite frankly, I\u2019d go as low contact with Heather as possible, and just not acknowledge any problems walk away from them instead \ndo not interact \nDo not allow any third-party, including family to set up some sort of interaction or to get involved with your interactions with Heather \n\nLet Heather be Heathers problem in fact, insist on that", "This is just weird.   Just ignore them and don't do it.  If the MIL brings it up again, tell her that you've shared all you're going to share on FB.  Let that be the end of it.  Do not allow her to continue the discussion.  Just tell you, you're not going to discuss it further and bid your goodbyes.  Weird.\n\nNTA", "You might be my new best friend.", "I was going to say the same thing or just blur her out in each photo.", "That's the vibe I get as well. Why does she want pictures? To imagine she is the bride or to compare herself to OP when trash talking her? NTA and the people telling you to just do it to keep the peace need to either choose you or Heather.", "Seems like a reasonable compromise, thank you!", "That\u2019s probably the best route to go if she still has an issue then there\u2019s just no winning", "Might just wear the AH badge proudly and do this.", "DecentDilettante -- you need to send a photo of your face to OP ASAP so the photoshopping can commence!", "id be petty and crop the photos of her to just include her and make sure your husband isnt in them at all", "Yeah man, don\u2019t dig your heels in over this crap, clearly she makes you insecure that\u2019s fine and that\u2019s your Busniess but this not posting anything is letting everyone know it.", "Not insecure. Just massively annoyed.", "Just have the photographer photoshop heather out of every photo. Every single photo. And then post all the pics. NTA", "NTA. Although Heather doesn't want to hear this... it was your wedding, not hers. Her behavior is bizarre and crosses the line. No, you don't get to demand a spot as a bridesmaid. No, the photographer wasn't there for your personal photo shoot. No, you don't get to stomp your feet and demand that photos of you be posted to social media.\n\n\nYour husband needs to back you on this. It would be okay to set firm boundaries with your new MIL.\n\n\nAlso, you should check out r/PhotoshopRequest. They can do damn near anything with photoshop.", "Why does she even care about you not posting her? You\u2019re not even close and it sounds like she doesn\u2019t even like you that much. Your MIL and husband are wrong for trying to guilt you into posting this weirdo.", "NTA It is an extremely odd request. If she asked me for photos directly I personally would have emailed her the photos she's in, but she didn't do that. She went roundabout and tried you to guilt you with someone else playing middle man to post on social media. Weird.", "NTA.  If it was me I would get petty.  I'd get a pic of the Pennywise balloon (red eyes, nose & mouth) and photoshop it over her face then post the pics.", "LOL photo shop Shrek or a random Skellator in the background.", "I was going to say that OP can email the photos to MIL and let her sort through them, since MIL is so worried about it.", "NTA it's called negative reinforcement. You will be rewarding bad behaviour.", "NTA. Heather wants your hubby :-D", "NTA. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to post your photos if you don\u2019t want to. They\u2019re your photos, not Heather\u2019s. She can post her own photos. And if she wanted photos of her from the wedding, then she should\u2019ve had someone take some for her. Heather is acting like a spoiled entitled brat. You don\u2019t owe her anything, especially appreciation. \n\nJust a little story I find funny: I saw a mean girl from my town post 300 pics from her wedding. She literally posted ALL of them. She craves attention and validation. I thought that was nuts. No one does huge photo dumps like that anymore, we\u2019re not in high school or college. Her mentality is still stuck there though \ud83d\ude02\n\nETA: I really hope hubby doesn\u2019t cave and give her any photos. That\u2019ll just tell her that she can throw tantrums and get her way.", "I was thinking of taking all\nOf the pictures with Heather in them and cropping it so she is the only thing in the pic and then posting them \u201cBecause Heather demanded that I post pictures of her at my wedding. \u201c", "Don't post one picture of that woman anywhere! Don't send it to her! Don't even send it to your mother-in-law cuz she'll give it to her! There's some weird fixation this woman has on your husband. She was perfectly fine not being around you until this when she suddenly had to get all involved in it. Either she's telling people there's something going on that there isn't and she wants the pictures to back it up, or she's going to use them to embarrass you somehow. Maybe she wants to show somebody them so she can talk about you?\n\nI don't trust this girl at all. Don't give her a thing. She has no rights to your private memories. If she wanted pictures so badly she could have taken them! She was there! But for some reason she wants your professional pictures that you paid for. It's suspicious. NTA", "What is all this nonsense about placating other people's crazy notions. It just encourages them to get even worse."]}
