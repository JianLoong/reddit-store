I 40 (f) am the oldest of 3, my younger brother unfortunately passed away  5 years ago along with my SIL in a tragic car accident. I was with my husband watching brothers 1 year old daughter at the time my sister was 22 at the time it happened. SIL family did not want to take in my niece, so me and my husband legally adopted her. We do not have any children of our own because at the age of 28 we decided to be child free, but we absolutely love our niece (Emma) and raised her as our own anyhow.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem my sister Ash (27) now found out she and her husband cannot have kids of their own, while I do feel bad for her she came over for dinner one night and asked if I was willing to let her adopt Emma. Frankly even though I was planning to be child free me and my husband absolutely love Emma, even though we are very honest that we aren\u2019t her biological parents and show and tell her stories of her actual parents, Emma refers to both me and my husband as mommy and daddy, we cannot just give her up as if she was a mere toy. I told my sister no I was not willing and while I understand where she is coming from I cannot just let her take Emma from us and mother her out of convenience. This is when ash starts bawling and shouting at me that it is \u201cher turn\u201d and that me and my husband did not even want kids. My husband took Emma upstairs because seeing her auntie cry made Emma upset. I continue trying to sympathize and explain to ash that Emma sees us as her parents and it is not fair to Emma to just toss her around, also just because ash is not able to have biological children of her own does not mean she can throw a tantrum and be entitled of Emma\u2019s life. Ash stops crying and seems to understand, she leaves later on.\n\n5 days later I get a text from my parents and ash\u2019s husband telling me and my husband to let ash and her husband adopt Emma and I can continue being in Emma\u2019s life as her aunt instead. Their other points are that because Ash and Brad are younger they will live longer for Emma and because my husband and I just reached our 40\u2019s we wouldn\u2019t have long. Ouch. Somehow ash has gotten some of our cousins involved as well and most of my family are willing to cut me off if I do not give up Emma to ash. lately knowing my family is willing to cut me off makes me wonder if I was being to harsh  by calling her out as if she was a child herself. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: This just came up in my mind. Ash and her husband cannot afford IVF and she\u2019s more adamant to have children that share our bloodline. I\u2019ve talked to her about adopting and she was very excited and pleased. Maybe she thought it was a invitation to adopt Emma?", "created_utc": 1667945534, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yq07x7/aita_for_not_letting_my_sister_adopt_our_late/", "score": 175, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do NOT let these people be apart of Emma's life any longer as they will only treat her like crap. From experience if your sister magically gets pregnant Emma will be last years ratty shoes compared to the shiny newborn she birthed. You are doing the right thing not letting it happen. Plus the psychological trauma of losing her parents and then her adoptive parents giving her up?? Like your sister should not have kids if she thinks it's okay to do that to the poor baby. You are amazing for taking her in and raising her. Continue protecting her as you are.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s been 5 years. This isn\u2019t a fricken dog. Emma has built bonds with you and you\u2019ve done the same with her. Ignore your family and let your sister solve her own problems.\n\nI\u2019d be worried about legal recourse if you didn\u2019t do everything by the book but do what is best for Emma not for your sister. God forbid she changes her mind in a few years and just \u201cgives her back\u201d.", "Are these people aware Emma is a living breathing human being and not a fun purse to share? What the actual F is wrong with them. You legally adopted her. The trauma Emma would undertake having to have her life uprooted is horrifying. Your sister and extended family are all AH and I would massively distance yourself from them. NTA.", "WTF...a kid isn't a painting or a piece of furniture. The simple fact that your sister would suggest such a thing means she has no idea what it is to be a parent. \n\nNTA and I'd make sure you document everything in case you need a restraining order.", "NTA\n\nEven a pet can't be rehomed like a furniture.\nEnjoy your family and the others can duck of...\n\nBeing 40+ is \"neardeath\"???? \nSo your brother was older?/s\nKarma is a bitch and your sister get a taste", "NTA\n\nThey are clearly talking about something that is against Emma's best interested. This is a 6yo - separating her from her parents would be incredibly disruptive and potentially traumatic.", "NTA this is making me so upset for you. They are not thinking of the child, but rather their own needs. That alone makes them unfit to parent.", "NTA. WTF is wrong with your family that they are supporting this?", "NTA. What is wrong with your family? Let them know Emma is your daughter, she thinks of you as her mother and father, and you are not giving her up. She is not a doll or family heirloom to be passed around so that everyone gets a turn. She is a living breathing little human who does not deserve to have her life turned upside down because of her Aunt\u2019s unfortunate circumstances.", "NTA.\n\nWhy are they treating Emma like she\u2019s a pet? So she already lost one set of parents, now they want her to \u201close\u201d another set of parents? You seriously need to explain to them how incredibly not ok their behavior is.\n\nForget all of their opinions. When does Emma get what Emma wants? I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t want to be handed off to another set of parents like an object. Fuck. Are they capable of considering her as a person?", "NTA, she is acting like a spoiled brat that didn't get the toy she wanted. Emma is now your child because of the situation so it would be like going to other parents and saying you want their kid because you can't have one. I'm sorry that she can't have kids but if she is willing to adopt Emma and has nothing against this way then she should look into a adoption agency. But wanting to manipulate you and the family to force you to rip a child from her only parents she has known ( because she is 1 when her parents died and possibly doesn't remember them ) for her own benefit and not considering what is best for the child makes me really icky on the inside.", "NTA. This is utterly shameless. Emma is not a possession to be traded around. I know that some people who really want children go to irrational lengths, but reading this was a new low.", "OH GOD.\n\nThat poor little girl... \n\nThis is all insane. You've raised her as your child. She's a little girl, not a barn cat. You can't just hand her around to someone like that. And (while your age is irrelevant... I'm not really sure what unhinged logic is going through your parents' brains) 40 isn't even that old! \n\nNTA.", "NTA but there\u2019s something seriously wrong with your sister and parents. Emma is not a toy to pass around. They clearly don\u2019t care how they would hurt her. They only care about themselves and should be ashamed. I\u2019d go no connect tbh. That\u2019s so gross of them.", "NTA This proposed re-adoption offers no benefit at all to Emma. She's 6 years old and your sister wants to tear her childhood apart out of selfishness. Honestly I would cut anyone who is taking your sisters side out of your life for being horrible people willing to inflict suffering on a child to appease a grown woman.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that your sister objectifies her niece because of HER desire to have a baby tells me she is utterly unfit to parent a child.  \n\nIt would be absolutely destructive to upend Emma's life again because of an entitled, baby-desperate person who does not actually give a damn about Emma's well-being.", "NTA \n\nAsh needs therapy", "Info:  WTF is wrong with your family?  Do they think this child is a shiny toy to be fought over?  She's been with you for 5 years and no one seems to be talking about how traumatic it would be for Emma to lose a second set of parents.\n\nAlso NTA.  What you are is an amazing and decent human being.", "Wow! Emma must be one cute kid! \n\nLooks like everyone seems to have mistaken her for a toy doll. A family heirloom? Passed down when one generation is fading away?\n\nNTA. You and your husband are awesome for taking on responsibility after she so tragically lost her parents (and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, OP) - despite your personal preferences and choices. And between your behavior then and now - you\u2019re very clearly the BEST parents for Emma, no matter who else sees it.", "Nta and maybe you should cut them out of you and Emily's life. They are talking about doing irreparable damage to a child for your sister's selfish wants. Your sister and family are disgusting, selfish, and cruel. Emily is old enough to remember and a human with human feelings. Tell the to all go to hell.", "NTA she is legally your daughter.\n\nTo her, she has two sets of parents. You, and your brother and his wife who you care enough about to make sure she knows about them.\n\nThis is not in her best interests and is coming from a selfish place within your sister. I get she's hurting but your daughter is not something you 'take turns with', and I can't believe your family are siding with her.", "NTA all the way. That little girl is not a shiny object that is shared family property. Even if the arrangement isn\u2019t what anyone imagined 6 years ago and your sister is grieving her own situation, that doesn\u2019t make it your or Emma\u2019s (the 6 year old!!) responsibility to fill the hole in her heart.", "NTA. NO! \n\nAsh is ridiculously entitled and selfish - treating Emma like a stuffed toy that you\u2019ll have \u2018turns\u2019 with. You\u2019re raising Emma. You adopted her. She only knows you as her parents. To wrench her away to suit your bratty sister would be cruel.\n\nYour family supporting her need to grow up and think of the  ACTUAL CHILD - Emma - not the adult throwing a selfish tantrum.", "NTA. It's been FIVE YEARS! Emma has effectively only experienced you and your husband as her parents. To take her away from you would harm all three of you, and for no good reason at all. \n\nIt's sad Ash is struggling with infertility. That doesn't give her the right to steal your child. It's beyond cruel for her to even suggest this, let alone to do it when Emma was home to see!", "Now this is just pure selfish idiocy on part of your sister. NTA", "NTA X 1000000! You raised that child and cared for her during a very traumatic time, for your sister to think she can rip her away from you is absurd! You\u2019re right that she isn\u2019t a toy or puppet to be pushed and pulled around. She already *has* a home and parents who love her. There are plenty of children who don\u2019t have that luxury. If your sister wants to adopt a child, there is no shortage. Though right now I question her ability to parent if she expects a kid to be able to be taken from their home and easily adjust to a new set of parents.\n\nAnd the fact that other family members are dogpiling on you for this? Girl, bye. None of them have Emma\u2019s best interest at heart and they need to sit their entitled selves down.", "NTA. It doesn't matter how many family members they get to crawl out of the woodwork to bully you - you are right and they are wrong. I can't believe that they would consider doing this to any of you, but especially to the child. WTF is going through their heads!?", "NTA, I guess it's time to cut some family off. They all are toxic and entitled as fuck. Gosh, sometimes I really do hate family....or maybe it's just mine hence why I cut contact for 7 years cause they would pull a stunt like this. Kudos for being an awesome mom!! Stand your ground.", "NTA. Emma is a human, an actual person with needs and feelings. She's not a toy that can be passed on like a hand-me-down. You and your husband are currently the only people who seem interested in what's best for *her.* Which makes it obvious that she's exactly where she needs to be.", "NTA\n\nEmma is not a toy she is a human being who deserves to be nutured and loved. If your family is threatening to cut you off because you view Emma as a person and not a trading card then maybe they are doing you a favor.", "NTA. Your sister is being an entitled brat. This isn\u2019t some toy as you said. Emma loves you and your husband and think of you as her parents. This poor girl would be put through a lot to pick up and move  in with her new family. With the way your sister is acting would she even be fit to be a parent? You\u2019re not the asshole and please don\u2019t let this happen to Emma.", "NTA your whole family sounds mentally disturbed. I can\u2019t imagine how Emma will be psychologically damaged losing another set of parents in her life.", "NTA. In fact, you\u2018d join the line of AHs in your family if you agreed to give up your child. It doesn\u2019t matter that you didn\u2019t birth her, you are the parents she knows. How on earth can anyone think a 6yo would understand that her aunt thinks it\u2018s her turn to be mummy now? Your daughter would feel abandoned and think you don\u2019t love her and she did something wrong. If your family cuts you off over this, good riddance. Your daughter deserves better.", "Oh my god she's not a consolation prize for infertility! She's a child who has a home and a family! Absolutely NTA, let the trash take itself out.", "Oh, because losing one set of parents isn't traumatic enough.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Emma is not a doll to be passed around between siblings. She\u2019s a child who has endured a huge loss, and is now part of a new loving family. To change that would be immensely cruel and selfish. WTF is wrong with your sister.", "You have a weird family", "Emma\u2019s not a toy to pass around!  Wth is wrong with your family?  Just the fact your sister thinks this is ok would make her a bad mom.", "NTA she isn\u2019t a doll! What are these people thinking?", "Go to a child psychologist and discuss with them, I am \ud83d\udcaf% they will agree with you. And tell your family to drop this immediately. \nNTA", "NTA- Tell Ash to research Reactive Attachment Disorder.", "NTA - A child attachment years are between 0-5 years, which Emma has spent with you and your husband.  If you up root her now, it will confuse her  and maybe emotionally traumatic for her.  She already calling you and your husband mommy and daddy. \n\nI am surprised your parents are putting your sister emotional needs before their grandchild.", "NTA\n\nChildren don't get rehomed like kittens or puppies. The process of a human bonding to a caregiver is complex and not transferrable. \n\nAssuming the little girl was re-homed/adopted, it would likely harm her significantly. And guess what - with child adoptions, the #1 consideration is what is best for the child. The fact that your sister *wants* the child is completely irrelevant. \n\nYou need to make a list of the people harassing you over this, and make sure they never have unsupervised time with her.", "Emma has suffered enough. If your family wants to cut you off, ok then. Keep your daughter.", "NTA, you adopt a kid because they need you, not because of you want from them. Your sister is very wrong-headed about this.", "Ywbta if you uproot that little girl again.

It might be best if your sister isn't a parent to anyone, as she's clearly prioritizing her own needs over those of a(n already traumatized) child. To go through another life upheaval will absolutely permanently harm Emma. It is not what's best for her. That should be the only consideration for your entire family.

What did I just read?! \n\nTotally NTA! \n\nIt sounds like your sister needs to grow up some more before she takes on the responsibility of having kids of her own! \n\nYou're right OP - she's not a toy to be passed around your family. \nYou are (in effect) Emma's parents in her eyes. You have loved and cared for her most of her life. You are all she knows as parents.\n\nAnd here's the thing, if (somehow) your family convinced you to give Emma to your sister, what do you think that would do to Emma and her relationship with you? \nShe'd probably hate you for giving her up. And probably hate her \"new-new\" parents for taking her away from you. \n\nHonestly, if your family want to cut you out for something so stupid and selfish (because Ash is being selfish - she's not caring about Emma's wellbeing at all here) then I think you should cut ties. They sound absolutely toxic. \n\nStay strong OP. For Emma's sake if nothing else. You sound like you're being excellent parents. \n\n\nSide note: When Ash made the comment about how you're older and \"won't have as long\" it made me think. \n\nI'm not being funny (because it's not), but your brother sadly died at a young age - younger than your sister is now. \nThere's a chance that something will happen and your sister might pass away before you. I'm not wishing that on her. Just being frank. \n\nYou can't plan for everything in life and neither can she.

Tell all of the 'family' members trying to pressure you into giving up your daughter to kick rocks and block them.

You stepped up to the plate and sacrificed a child free life to take in Emma and have raised her as your own, selflessly, both you and your husband. It is very selfish of your sister to do the opposite-sacrifice Emma\u2019s stable life and uproot the 3 of yours. This is not a normal ask, this is spoiled brat behaviour over a serious situation.

That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s okay for her and her husband to demand you give up your Emma. In this case, that demand is about them and their feelings and not about what is good for Emma. You are absolutely right. She\u2019s not a toy. She\u2019s a living and breathing and thinking human, and this kind of disruption could be really emotionally harmful to her. I would honestly set a boundary to your sibling and say that you need to step back because this hurts and you know it hurts for her too. I hope she seeks out support\u2026whether mental health professional, any sort of religion they might like, et cetera.
