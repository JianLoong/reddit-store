Being a caregiver for his parents, doing all the cooking/cleaning/grocery shopping/laundry for 4 adults means she's absolutely working more than him. Buddy is barely pulling his own weight, let alone \"all the weight.\"", "I usually don't see it that way. He would do the same for us.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "As in my parents.", "Go take full care of your spouses parents, on top of maintaining the house by yourself, before you call that 'being kept'. There is a difference between meaningfully contributing, and meaningfully contributing finances, she is doing the former, her hb is doing the latter barely. You sound like you have a lot of reflecting and growing left to do, and I wish you a whole lot of luck with that because it seems like you need it.", "I mean OP could very well be lying. But based on the information we have 1) the husband was unemployed for a while and OP's earnings were sufficient to cover all expenses, 2) even if you don't consider it \"hard work,\" a social media marketing job - even for 1 client - can absolutely take up 2 to 3 hours each day, 7 days a week, 3) husband works 35 hours a week and OP works 21, the 2 hours less of work a day was an average across the week.", "No, he wouldn't. He would let you do all the work though, and complain in exactly the same way. What does he do for his parents daily?", "If you mean that he would let your parents move in and let you be their caretaker, he absolutely would.\n\nIf you are thinking that he would lift a finger to take care of your parents, when he won't for his own, you are deluding yourself."]}
