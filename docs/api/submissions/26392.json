Dusting usually is done first so that anything that's not trapped in the duster is vacuumed up and that usually takes half an hour.

Dishes take 15 minutes after each meal. It's all about the budgeting the time. You really need to learn to budget and keep on top of things. Bathrooms don't take long either a complete cleaning takes about half an hour if you do them three times a week so total.
