Issue here is my mom's partner, let's call him John (M62).\n\nI (F29) work freelance so i'm always at home while my partner (M27) works office hours at a lab. We are particularly under pressure these days as we are looking for a new house together in Paris (France), which is frustrating and time-consuming.\n\nToday, John was taking my grandma to run errands nearby my house, and decided to come over. I was busy between arranging meetings and house viewings and tidying up my house when they rung the intercom of my building. I was so puzzled it was them that i didn't say anything and let them in. John tried joking around \"we saw the windows open so we figured you were home even tho you were not answering your phone\". I told him i was busy, i had agency to call and made it clear they were disturbing me. John said they weren't staying that long anyways (which is true, they left after 30 min or so).\n\nI was fuming. I decided to text him the following message after they left:\n\"hey John, it's nice of you to stop by, please refrain from doing so without my confirmation through a prior phone call. I am very busy and even tho you weren't staying long you disturbed my pace and schedule. Take care bye\". He hasn't responded.\n\nI spoke to my mom later on that day and she said my message was too harsh and i should have called him to tell him directly in a \"playful way\". AITA for sending this text?\n\nEDIT: a few commenters are righfully asking for more info so i'll try my best to provide.\n\n- I saw John and my mom on Saturday night (we played board games at their hour, they live 8min drive from our place). I was at their house again yesterday (Sunday) for lunch, and my grandmother was there too (I picked her up with my car and drove her back afterwards, and i ended up staying with her for dinner). So today was the second day in a row I was seeing my grandma, and the third in a row for John. So it's not like I hadn't seen them in a while or anything. \n\n- For context: my grandfather passed away almost two months ago, hence why we are helping my grandma out. She lives 10 min drive from me but she can't drive. \n\n- Also for context: John was one of my dad's former best friends, my mom had an affair with him, leading to my parents divorce. I have known John since I was a child because my parents were friends with him and his late wife. \n\n- It was the first time he dropped by unannounced at my place, but he also did it with my sister who just had her first baby (first grandson in the family), I'm not sure if she told him off. He has a tendency of \"forcing\" the relationships like he calls himself the 'grandpa' of my nephew, which irks me a bit but my personal opinion is not relevant in that matter.  \n\n- Someone asked if my grandma could have been the instigator of the visit, and if I would have been rude to her like this as well. She might have been (i tried to reach her afterwards but she wasn't responding) but since we were together yesterday from 12 to 9pm (including 4 hours just the two of us) I doubt it + John said he was the one who suggested coming over to get coffee at my place. Would I be rude to her in the same way? Probably not, because she always calls before coming over so it probably wouldn't be necessary. \n\nThank you everyone for the comments so far, I'll try to respond to each of you.", "created_utc": 1687790432, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jj5r1/aita_for_telling_my_moms_partner_to_call_me/", "score": 520, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I had to think about this one a lot, and it seems like as sweet as he\u2019s trying to be, it interferes with your WFH situation. It\u2019s one thing if you\u2019re just home, but you WFH. You\u2019re at work literally. People don\u2019t stop by workplaces like that, because they know you\u2019re working. I would still probably have another chat with him, and just explain it nicely. Older people don\u2019t always \u201cget\u201d work from home, despite how self explanatory it seems to many of us. No need to be \u201cplayful,\u201d that might just be received as joking and not serious, and that\u2019s the opposite message you want to get across.", "YTA for letting them disturb you, stewing in that anger, and explicitly calling them a disturbance, rather than kindly telling them that you don\u2019t have the time to entertain them, even briefly, and sending them on their way.  \n\nIf they challenged you, then you would have had every reason to be explicitly firm. Otherwise, your response was over the top for a first offence where you didn\u2019t know who instigated the visit. The rest of his history doesn\u2019t matter when your grandmother was right alongside him. \n\nRegardless, there are ways to say it politely, like: \u201cHi John- Nice to see you and Gran today. In the future, I\u2019d really appreciate it if you could make sure you get an ok from me by phone or text before unplanned visits. Though the visit was short, it was still hard to get everything done in the time I had left. Thanks a lot! Take care.\u201d", "And not to drop the bomb or anything, but if your sister could be John's child if she's allowing him to be considered the grandfather. I find it unlikely that your mom *just started* having an affair with the guy she's known for many years. She just recently got caught is how I see it.\n\nEdited: opposites", "Im going to go against the grain and say esh. I understand its a new era with technology and stranger danger so people are paranoid about someone knocking on the door but I dont think its that big of a deal. \nWhat is a big deal is that when you told him you didnt have time for company he should of left, you shouldnt of entertained for 30 min.", "Nta. I'll never understand why people don't lock their doors. Even if it's a safe neighborhood. So much shit can be solved by locking it.", "NTA but I probably would have told my mother to deliver the message", "NTA but your \u201cplease refrain\u201d was definitely not friendly.  You don\u2019t have to be whatever \u201cplayful\u201d means but you could have just said \u201csorry, I\u2019m in the middle of something and can\u2019t chat now,\u201d and just had him carry on in the first place. It sounds like you don\u2019t like him because of the affair which totally makes sense.  I guess the point is- you don\u2019t seem to like him and it comes across. You may not care about that, and your mom is just going to have to live with the situation that she created.", "NTA. I hate people turning up unannounced. It's really rude to just assume someone is available for a visit. It's not hard to call ahead and ask.", "You are free to set boundaries nothing wrong with that. Next time may something different for a text message will help. The guy is not young and I assume that he prefers to have certain conversations face to face. Younger people might not need that and a text message is fine.", "NTA. I would have (and have in the past to family surprise drop bys) greeted them at the door and let them know that I was busy. I wouldn't have allowed them past the front door. It only needed to be done once with each family member and everyone calls or texts for permission now.", "Nta. Doing things 'playfully\" gives him an excuse to say \"I thought you were kidding.\"\n\nAlso, now that you know, if it happens again don't let them in", "NTA. I expect my parents (who live down the street) to call or text me to see if it\u2019s okay to stop by and I do the same for them. Long gone are the days of unexpected guests.", "NTA.  It is breathtakingly bad manners to just drop in on people, it\u2019s something people with good manners never do unless it\u2019s an established habit that\u2019s agreed upon.  A quick call or text is mandatory.  I won\u2019t even drop in on my own daughter who lives next door.  I respect her household, a text first is the minimum.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s very rude to just drop by someone\u2019s home unannounced. As demanding as people\u2019s careers are, and having to juggle kids, pets and so on, it\u2019s disruptive to just \u201cdrop in\u201d on someone. Not even counting all the remote work from home. Folks just don\u2019t have time for pop up visits. \n\nGiving A heads up is the proper thing to do to see if they have the time in their schedule for an impromptu visit. Period", "Dare I say that if he calls first, he's no longer stopping by unannounced?\n\nNTA because that's a completely normal expectation. I don't answer the door if I'm not expecting someone.", "NTA. I don't answer my door at all if I'm not expecting anyone.", "NTA! Good job on being directly. Sometimes, you need to be firm with certain people if they don't listen. It's okay to be mean if they don't get it the first time. Tell them off if they kept nagging you. And yes, you can always set up boundaries for your own mental health when it comes to family, friends or people showing up unannounced at your door! So you can have your peace of mind.", "NTA. My family knows not to just drop by without prior approval. I may be working, sleeping, or just not up for guests. Most of my family respects this boundary. The ones who don't...I don't answer the door. I don't care if they can hear the TV that's 10 feet away from the front door, they didn't call/text beforehand, so I'm not opening the door.", "NTA!! I hate unannounced visitors, no matter who they are, my husband and I WFH and our families think they can stop by anytime because of this, it\u2019s so annoying. You did nothing wrong, it\u2019s good to set boundaries.", "NTA, your house, your rules. Maybe mom's partner can learn to use a phone like the rest of us.", "Fuck that. You sent a crystal clear message. NTA. This 'playful way' bullshit might as well cause John not to take you seriously.", "ESH\nhe was weird for doing it\nUnless you strongly suspected i\u2019ll intent, your message was unnecessarily rude. Could\u2019ve gotten the same message across in a nicer way \u201chey! It was nice seeing you today. I mean no offense but can you please call me before you stop by next time? I\u2019m just always busy and like staying on a strict schedule\u201d", "This is actually disturbing with the added edit.  This man was your father's best friend and then schtukt your mom.  Then you mentioned he calls himself the grandpa?!  Of your sisters child?!  This guy is inserting himself into your lives with egregious over stepping of boundaries.  I don't think I'd be as calm about it as you.  So good on you for that.  But this is extremely disturbing.  You're NTA but I would definitely take a step back from all this and discuss things your immediate family and them have a boundaries discussion with this creep.  Cause that's what he is.  A creep.", "Definitely NTA. He was disturbing you.", "NTA, but if it happens again, I'd just tell them simply that you're in the middle of your work day and unfortunately it won't be possible for them to come in.", "He\u2019s a grown ass man, \u201cbe playful with your boundaries\u201d HELL no, you were very polite and cordial with your email, maybe he will start calling before he just shows up. Your NOT The Ass!", "NTA this isn't a sitcom;  boundaries need to be respected especially at someone's own house.", ">she said my message was too harsh and i should have called him to tell him directly in a \"playful way\". \n\nNTA. If you'd told him \"playfully\" he would have \"misunderstood\" and continued to drop by and interrupt your work.\n\nHe's from a generation where your family didn't contact you at work unless a close relative had died or was in the hospital with hours to live. He knows better and decided to disrespect you and the work you do, as though you spend your days earning pin money rather than earning a living.", "My family understands that they have to call or text me first and get my okay. My reason is my anxiety disorder. I need to prepare myself for visitors. But, for whatever reason, you set a firm boundary. It\u2019s nothing personal. You work at home. It\u2019s not a time to visit. \n\nI also agree that society expects women to be gentle and respectful in their boundary-setting, but the reality is that people tend to not take you seriously until you firmly put your foot down. If someone has a problem with that, it\u2019s on them.", "NTA\n\nWFH is still work. Just because you are home does not make you available to visit. You have every right to put in place boundaries and not welcome surprise guests during your working hours.", "NTA \n\nWFH is **Work** from home.", "I dont like anyone stopping by unannounced.  If someone does it once, I tell them, hey, next time call first , even of its from the corner gas station.", "NTA\n\nHow else is the man to learn what your preferences are? He's a big boy and doesn't need to be treated like a child. Your mom needs to relax, and he needs to grow up. You did good, OP.", "Exactly, this is a grown man and it is not your job to protect his feelings? Wtf\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Seriously. I have to enforce my boundaries with my family \"playfully\" because it's the only way they don't get offended, but it gets really tiring having to have what should be serious conversations in what amounts to baby talk, and that's just a result of what I've learned works in my observations. For OPs mom to outright suggest doing that is just ridiculous. We shouldn't have to treat our parents or grandparents as though they're children just to avoid conflict.", "Exactly. I don't even look out the blinds if I'm not expecting someone or possibly mail that needs to be signed for much less just open the door up. Even just a text is helpful if it wasn't planned.", "Exactly right. My husband and I live next door to my Dad and new StepMom both of whom I adore and have no weirdness with but we ALL still text or call to make sure it\u2019s a good time before coming to one another\u2019s houses. It\u2019s polite and keeps us from imposing.", "Since he slept with his best friend's wife I am gonna go out in a limb and say personal boundaries are not Johnny Boys strong suit", "I agree. OP, mentioned somewhere in the thread that he\u2019s used to throwing tantrums when his emotions aren\u2019t cared for. And understanding the way older women operate, regarding subservience to the men in their lives. It\u2019s not difficult to see how accustomed she is, to acquiescing at the wants of the \u201cman of the house\u201d. She may be used to things operating so, in her household, but she needs to understand that his will isn\u2019t law in other people\u2019s homes. Her and her husband need to get with the program. ASAP.", "That was my thought too! But maybe the text was too strict and came off as rude idk", "Ha! That\u2019s exactly what I thought when I read this", "Thank you for this, i hadn't seen it that way. I have a hard time setting boundaries straight, and when i do i tend to be emotional and het unnecessarily upset, that's why i resorted to a text", "I agree with you, honestly I'm not looking forward to our next encounter haha\nThank you for your input!", "My sister is a physical copy paste of my mom and dad so I'm not worried about that, but honestly there is A LOT to add to the background, it just isn't relevant to the situation. i also spoke to my sister today, she doesn't like it when he calls himself grandpa of her child", "I honestly thought of it, but ultimately decided that this was between him and me and that i was old enough to be the adult and set my boundaries haha put on my big girl pants", "LMAOOOO!!! Not everyone who posts on Reddit is an American. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "If he still drops by, let him know via intercom that you're working right now and can't visit.  Don't let him in.  And then follow it up with a text later that says \"As a reminder, please call me first before stopping by to see if I'm available.  I work from home and was in business meetings when you stopped by earlier.  Just because I'm physically in my home does not mean that I'm available to visit.  Thanks!\"", "He is a fully grown man, there isn\u2019t a requirement for his emotions to be coddled as you would a toddler. You were polite and firm. It is your house. Yours.", "He\u2019s a grown man, he doesn\u2019t need to be told things playfully. Honestly, he shouldn\u2019t need to be told to not stop by unannounced (especially when you work for home) at all! \n\nHis poor male ego can handle it, you need to be direct and to the point.l if you want him to stop.", "If that text is verbatim, then only thing I would potentially change is stating that you\u2019re *working* from home, and business hours / etiquette still apply even though you\u2019re not in a traditional office.  \n\nNTA", "The fact that it is a text--that you corrected him in writing--may come across to John as more harsh than the same words delivered face-to-face.  That's kind of a generational thing.", "People need to start respecting \"WFH\" - they don't seem to realize that it is still \\*work\\*.", "Also, I\u2019m so damn tired of women having to set boundaries in a \u201cplayful\u201d way in order to protect men\u2019s fragile egos. You set a boundary in a clear and concise way. It wasn\u2019t rude. It wasn\u2019t mean. NTA", "Obviously won't judge the dynamics of the family here, and time will have obviously moved on a bit, but this guy assuming his partner's kids would want all that much to do with him given the circumstances already gives me the impression of someone overstepping boundaries without a second thought. I get shit happens in life and relationships are often messy, but most kids in that situation won't want the person their parent had an affair with to be close to them on a level where they just show up unannounced at their home.", "The context helps immensely. NTA", "Tell me where I assumed they were American. I said \u201cin ME\u201d", "Yeah, I keep telling people this. Would you go to someone's office and sit there talking crap and drinking coffee while they desperately tried to ignore you and type on their computer? Nope you wouldn't. Leave people alone!\n\n\nEdited because \"in the computer\" and \"on the computer\" are very different.", "NTA they haven't even been together that long and he's stopping by unannounced? No thank you.", "Yeah my boundaries aren't something to play with, so I'm not going to playfully set them. I don't understand why people think this is acceptable.", "I second this. Men can be rude and pushy, while women are expected to come up with polite and diplomatic ways of telling them no.", "exactly. he overstepped and you explained it to him. NTA if it needs to be playful he should work on getting a thicker skin.", "I wouldn't say \"rape\" but imo his moral compass is questionable. Hence maybe my reaction? Idk", " It everyone gets the \u201csouthern hospitality \u201c bullshit. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "He's an AP. They've probably been together a lot longer than you think.", "He\u2019s the man her mother had an affair with, which led to her parents divorce. The relationship you\u2019re describing clearly isn\u2019t the one they have.", "Again, southern hospitality IN ME. Didn\u2019t direct it towards anyone else.", "Not to mention being dads friend and fucking his wife does show some problems with boundaries in the first place.", "How does your dad feel about that?", "Wouldn't want to judge the dynamics of your family, but I wonder if his attempt to get close to the rest of the family is due to the nature of how they got together. But that's ultimately a problem for him, it's not of your making and you shouldn't have to feel responsible for his own hang-ups."]}
