Issue here is my mom's partner, let's call him John (M62).\n\nI (F29) work freelance so i'm always at home while my partner (M27) works office hours at a lab. We are particularly under pressure these days as we are looking for a new house together in Paris (France), which is frustrating and time-consuming.\n\nToday, John was taking my grandma to run errands nearby my house, and decided to come over. I was busy between arranging meetings and house viewings and tidying up my house when they rung the intercom of my building. I was so puzzled it was them that i didn't say anything and let them in. John tried joking around \"we saw the windows open so we figured you were home even tho you were not answering your phone\". I told him i was busy, i had agency to call and made it clear they were disturbing me. John said they weren't staying that long anyways (which is true, they left after 30 min or so).\n\nI was fuming. I decided to text him the following message after they left:\n\"hey John, it's nice of you to stop by, please refrain from doing so without my confirmation through a prior phone call. I am very busy and even tho you weren't staying long you disturbed my pace and schedule. Take care bye\". He hasn't responded.\n\nI spoke to my mom later on that day and she said my message was too harsh and i should have called him to tell him directly in a \"playful way\". AITA for sending this text?\n\nEDIT: a few commenters are righfully asking for more info so i'll try my best to provide.\n\n- I saw John and my mom on Saturday night (we played board games at their hour, they live 8min drive from our place). I was at their house again yesterday (Sunday) for lunch, and my grandmother was there too (I picked her up with my car and drove her back afterwards, and i ended up staying with her for dinner). So today was the second day in a row I was seeing my grandma, and the third in a row for John. So it's not like I hadn't seen them in a while or anything. \n\n- For context: my grandfather passed away almost two months ago, hence why we are helping my grandma out. She lives 10 min drive from me but she can't drive. \n\n- Also for context: John was one of my dad's former best friends, my mom had an affair with him, leading to my parents divorce. I have known John since I was a child because my parents were friends with him and his late wife. \n\n- It was the first time he dropped by unannounced at my place, but he also did it with my sister who just had her first baby (first grandson in the family), I'm not sure if she told him off. He has a tendency of \"forcing\" the relationships like he calls himself the 'grandpa' of my nephew, which irks me a bit but my personal opinion is not relevant in that matter.  \n\n- Someone asked if my grandma could have been the instigator of the visit, and if I would have been rude to her like this as well. She might have been (i tried to reach her afterwards but she wasn't responding) but since we were together yesterday from 12 to 9pm (including 4 hours just the two of us) I doubt it + John said he was the one who suggested coming over to get coffee at my place. Would I be rude to her in the same way? Probably not, because she always calls before coming over so it probably wouldn't be necessary. \n\nThank you everyone for the comments so far, I'll try to respond to each of you.", "created_utc": 1687790432, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jj5r1/aita_for_telling_my_moms_partner_to_call_me/", "score": 2334, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not from my parents, not from my friends, from nobody. And thankfully, they know that it is not personal. It took a fair while before they understood and also respected my request of telling me in advance if they wanted to come see me. With my dad, for one, there were 2 years where he'd give me a call ahead of time the one time, and then he would revert back to stopping by without previous notice the next. All is good now\n\nThere are several reasons I want to know beforehand if people are coming over. It could be one of the following (usually it's a combination of several of them):\n\n- I'm not even home\n- I'm having a bad (bed) day (thank you scoliosis - chronic spine condition)\n- My day is already filled with appointments\n- I'm in the middle of trying to arrange/schedule other things, which is consuming a lot of time and require a lot of my attention. (I think this could be equal to the stressful situation of looking for a new house - that IS a lot, and takes a shitload of time.) I don't want anything distracting or disturbing me if that's the case.\n- I don't have any drinks or snacks at home to offer (this always makes me feel bad)\n- Last but not least, I just need a little bit of time to get used to the idea that people are coming over before it actually happens. I'd like to know at least 2 hours in advance. More is preferred, less turns my own schedule for the day into a mess.\n\nVice versa, I never visit others without asking them if they are even ok with it in the first place. You just don't know what they might be doing or what plans they have already made for the day, and I'd feel very rude if I expected they would just make time for me once I show up. \n\nIt may also have to do with the culture one grew up in. I know families that pretty much live in with each other even though they actually only live 2 houses away on the same street. They share almost everything. And honestly, I think it's wonderful. It's just not for me. \n\nSummary... I think you had every right to ask your mom's partner to let you know if he's planning to come over. Your message wasn't too harsh. Maybe you should ask your sister if she ever told him off when he visited her unannounced after she just had her first baby. If she told him off but wasn't able to stop him, then maybe another way of communication is more successful to get through to him. I don't know where you live, but here, there is some kind of unspoken rule that you don't visit people who have only just welcomed a new life into their family, you let them enjoy their time with each other. If you do want to visit, you at least make sure you've confirmed with them when it would be a good time to come over. (E.g. also to make sure you don't wake up the baby, or drop by right when it's being fed.)\n\nEdit: I feel like I just wrote a book. I'm sorry if it's tl;dr.", "Next time they show up unannounced, short of a dire emergency tell them you apologize but you are working and cannot accept company. \"Oh hey we're in the neighborhood so we figured we'd stop by in a few\" doesn't fly either.

I never said all men were like that and if you\u2019re a man and this made you feel defensive then maybe you should ask yourself why. And again, I never said that being tactful was exclusively a male requirement.

You didn't cuss him out or say anything harsh.

Especially if he was my dad's friend and I'd known him for years.  I would be very firm with my mom about never accepting him, he's never invited to anything, and I'll never visit as long as he's there.\n\n\nClearly you are a much more forgiving person than I am.", "NTA. You\u2019re not obligated to be available to him 24/7.\nAlso, you\u2019re mom and John are assholes for going behind your dad\u2019s back.

This is a reasonable boundary to have as I personally wouldn\u2019t want a sudden surprise visit from anyone and I\u2019m not decent for any reason. You have the same right to set this boundary, especially since you do work from home and shouldn\u2019t be disturbed while on the clock (I am aware that you said you\u2019re freelance but the concept still applies, work is work).

I\u2019m recovering from cancer treatment and naps are sacred in this house", "I worked from home long before the Pandemic, and it was an issue for me many times.  I guess I was fortunate as most people still had to work in the office, so there weren't many work hour  interruptions, but enough times it was a problem. I often spent 6+ hours daily in meetings, so I couldn't really talk or easily interact with people, but they would seem put out when I had my reason to shut them down.

I'd tell both of those assholes to kick rocks.", "He didn't really do anything unreasonable. You even admit that your grandma may have wanted to stop by. He's only ever stopped by once before so I think you just don't care for the dude and prefer he not stop by. That's your choice of course. Sounds like the deeper issue is with your mom.............", "NTA but also sort of NAH? You don't seem to hate John so it doesn't strike me as wrong that he might want to stop by, but you're totally valid in asserting a boundary around it and your Mom is wrong for suggesting its on you to manage his feelings.", "Just show them to a couch - \"Sit there and be quiet, I need to continue work.

You have every right to your boundaries. Your text wasn\u2019t mean but could be read as curt/cold. It does sound like John is making a sincere effort to be kind to you, cares about your family, etc. So while I don\u2019t think you did anything \u201cwrong\u201d I think it\u2019s just always good practice to be as kind as possible to the people in your life who try to do the same. We\u2019re all human and all make mistakes\u2014like unintentionally crossing people\u2019s boundaries. I am guessing that was not John\u2019s intention.

Would you be so kind to give me a heads up next time you\u2019d like to drag your saggy nuts into my apt? As you know I work from home and\u2026etc etc.\u201d (minus the absurd shit of course!) It\u2019s being honest while acknowledging his intended effort in a kind way. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe him an apology as your text to him wasn\u2019t meant as a slight. Maybe next time you see him you can say something appreciative about helping w your grandma and then kindly explain the important of checking in before visiting.

I feel it is very cowardly to send an abrupt text afterwards. Live you life how you want but if you are going to set boundaries, be up front about it to his face. I lived in a country where not only do people come by unannounced, they walk through your front door opening it without knocking. Doors were not locked.

In fact they never seem to call before 8ish or after 530. Not unique at all to WFH and I would venture a safe bet most small business owners get many many more solicitations than someone at home does via door to door sales people. I don\u2019t say that in a condescending way at all, just that many people who work in a bigger business, at home, or in X department aren\u2019t subject to these.
