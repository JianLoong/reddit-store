She would have every right.\n\nBut I think that\u2019s your actual end game. You don\u2019t want to be accused of abandoning your daughter, so you are pushing her to make the choice.\n\nEdit: Plus, you stated she knew you were planning a trip AND you decided to take it during a time when she would usually be with you.

You do *not* have \"enough money for 4.\" You deliberately made travel choices (fare, accommodations, activities, etc) that are too expensive for your budget. \n\nYou're double the A H because you are not managing your children's interactions.

And thereby letting her know that she is not considered part of the family. The core family.\n\nHave you ever thought that this is why she brags about her trips with her dad? If this is how you treat her, maybe it's her only way of feeling validated.

If you really truly wanted to. \n\nThis is about evening the score for your boys. Giving them the opportunity to finally brag over your daughter. And I'm also betting it's to a place she's never been before to add salt to the wound. \n\nThis is what happens when people who haven't matured past middle school become parents. \n\nLife is never equal or fair. Is it fair to your daughter that her brothers have both parents at home while she moves back and forth between homes and people? Nope. I don't see you trying to even the score there. \n\nIs it fair for your boys that their sister has a rich dad who takes her around the world? Nope.  That's life. \n\nBut you've clearly chosen a side. Own it. Stop hiding behind the \"we couldn't afford it\" because I'm sure her dad would've paid for her to come with you guys.

Now unless you told your daughter that she isn\u2019t considered family, then at the tender age of 14, she probably thought she was included. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is you telling her a week ahead of the trip that she can\u2019t come to your home during her designated weekend with YOU because you\u2019re going on vacation with every other member of the family. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why she visits on designated weekends, but it sounds like dad is already the primary parent. \n\nYou had several other alternatives. Save until she could go, going for a shorter period of time so ALL family members can go.  Ask her dad to pay her part of the trip.  I\u2019ve already read your excuses how none of this will work.  They are excuses. \n\nDo you talk as bitterly about her dad when she\u2019s around?  You keep referring to him as a HERO in denigrating terms because he does things for her. He doesn\u2019t owe your other children. \n\nDid you even bother to tell her dad ahead of time that her weekend with you wasn\u2019t happening?  Because he\u2019s the one that has to cover for you while all of you are gone.  Or was that responsibility up to your 14 year old daughter to convey. \n\nIf I were her dad, I\u2019d have you served with papers when you get back. What you are doing is emotionally detrimental to your daughter.  \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how many trips her father takes her on. It\u2019s his money, and she is the only child he\u2019s responsible for from your household. The only thing she knows is she\u2019s being excluded from mom\u2019s family. \n\nYou said your daughter gets bratty and snotty with your other kids. How do they act towards her?  They could be triggering her actions.  If your a part time mom to her this could cause some resentment towards them on her behalf. \n\nI personally think your daughter acts this way because she knows you are prioritizing your new family.  You don\u2019t say if your youngest belongs to your current husband, but if he does then you have excluded your daughter from your new family. \n\nYour 9 year old is probably going to remember very little of the trip when he\u2019s older. I bounced all over the world because of the military and I remember very little of the trips we went on before I was 13. NTM children that age have shorter attention spans and get bored easily. It would have been better if you took the older kids. \n\nYou missed a wonderful opportunity to bond with your daughter. All you\u2019ve done is push her away and closer to her dad. You\u2019ve already said he\u2019s now planning a trip to make it up to her. \n\nYour daughter is 4 years from adulthood.

I spent years obsessing over this type of issue and I eventually had to just remind myself that I might be sitting here obsessing and I'm the furthest fucking thing from her mind. \n\nOP should be ready for the daughter to never speak to her again. Daughter will never forget this moment.", "Teens often say shitty things. \n\nTeens also brag A LOT. \n\nthe problem existed long before op could afford to take her kids away, this might actually make the sister realise what she was doing but it needed to be done with adult conversations and understanding, that's the part that is missing. \n\nDon't blame op for a shitty situation that has been created by unequal living situations and THE DAUGHTERS ATTITUDE.", "I\u2019m not excusing her, I\u2019m saying the father is not innocent either.", "I feel like that still makes him an AH too though because he is contributing to a situation where only one sibling out of three is getting an opportunity, and OP is trying (in a misguided way) to make things a little more equal. I\u2019d be curious to know if the location they are going to is one where the daughter has already been with her father.", "Because she's a textbook narc. mom who is jealous of her daughter.", "Well, good thing she will have the kids who are also poor by her side when she's old and gray. If she doesn't find another sibling to hate once daughter has bowed out", "Or it should\u2019ve been OPs week and they change fridays?", "I am  so sorry, and I hope you get to enjoy a wonderful relationship with your dad.", "The shitty situation is OP\u2019s fault, though, and her actions are her own. She is the adult in the situation.", "We blame op for how hateful she is towards her daughter.", ">father is not innocent either.\n\nand how did u come to this conclusion? Because the father isn't taking his ex's kids on a trip? Fgs he doesn't have anything to do with them.", "This doesn't make any sense.  OP's oldest daughter has a different father than OP's son. Why would the daughter's father have to take any of his daughter's half/step siblings on any trips he is taking with his daughter when he spends time with her?  If his ex had more children after their relationship ended, why is he expected to be responsible for them or take them on trips?? You know who could take OP's son on a trip? The son's father.  You know who can take OP's step kid on a trip?? Step kid's father.", "What are you talking about? How is her father an AH at all? The other 2 boys are not his children at all, not even a little bit. Why on Earth would he take them on a family vacation when they are in fact not his family? You sound a little ridiculous. Also, who cares if the daughter has already gone to that location with her father, she still should not be excluded from this. \n\nOP YTA 100% btw and it truly sounds like you hate your daughter.", "Well in that case, I have never traveled abroad, so no one should travel abroad ever!! I mean how is that fair to me?  OP is TA for even considering it without my input. As for the father hr clearly shouldn't do things with his daughter *just* because he can afford them. It's too unfair!!!", "Because that one child is his child and him and OP are split. \n\nAnother child is OPs with current partner, and the third is just OPs partners child", "I don't have one. Another point of contention for my mom.", "How is ops fault that the daughter goes on holiday to other countries and brags?", "Right?! That's psycho logic accusing a person with no biological relation to their ex's child borned after their relationship ended to have to provide our include them in whatever they provide for their own biological child. Like, what?", "And OP\u2019s son/step son *are* being taken on a trip by their father? That\u2019s exactly the issue OP is addressing here.", "I'm trying to put an example to this:\n\n* Me, my husband, his child (from previous relationship) go on a trip.\n\n* Me, my husband, his child, 2 other kids (one is the son to my husband's ex, another is step son to my husband's ex). Why should \"we\" pay for a vacation for those 2 kids?", "She hasn\u2019t done anything to modify her CHILD\u2019S behavior, then planned an entire trip with the intention to exclude her CHILD. She is a child. \n\nShe has no guidance except for a resentful mother and a (?) father. I wonder why she could possibly be acting up.", "By excluding OPs daughter. What are you not getting?", "No, it is not a trip being taken solely by their father.  If it was, it wouldn't be an issue. It's a family trip in which OP is the mother of 3 kids but specifically not taking the daughter.\n\nAre you OP masquerading under another account to try make sense of this to other commentators when your logic makes no sense at all??", "No, doesn't work that way as OP has a child too and should be included. OP's daughter's father has no obligation to take another man's kids with him on vacation. OP and her new husband do have an obligation to take her daughter however, as she is part of the family", "I'm betting OP is getting all those Y TA because of how she wrote. If she said \"my daughter is nagging my other kids, with all her travels, I tried address it but she keeps doing it and her father encourages her. So when we finally had money for a trip, I told her she was not welcome as a consequences of her actions\", I bet people would have supported her.", "The daughter\u2019s trips excluded her brothers. They are the ones getting overlooked in this entire discussion", "So are you saying OP\u2019s husband/the father to both boys should have to take a vacation without his wife because his stepdaughter\u2019s father can afford to spoil her?", "Why is it ok that \u201cOP\u2019s daughter\u2019s father has no obligation to take another man\u2019s kids with him on vacation\u201d but not ok that \u201cOP\u2019s sons\u2019 father has no obligation to take another man\u2019s kid with him on vacation\u201d?"]}
