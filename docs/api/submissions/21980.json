Because I told her no, she has responded by not coming to my bachelorette or bridal party and she has not been active at all in the wedding process. She thinks that I am being an unfair asshole, as other people are bringing parters that have been together for a shorter time than her and her boyfriend.\n\nMy sister has been with her boyfriend for about 8 months-- they have traveled together and basically live together-- she is sure that she is going to marry this guy. Thing is, when they met-- she was already engaged to her partner of 10+ years whom all of my family loved deeply.  She met her new boyfriend at work, she was engaged and he was married. Essentially, they both had affairs and left their partners to be with eachother.\n\nI've met this guy and I do not like him at all. One-- he is still married and in the process of divorcing his wife-- we've all heard that before! Two-- I had an honest conversation with him asking his intentions with my sister and why he ended it with his wife. His excuse was that his previous wife \"forced\" him into the relationship and didn't know love was real until he met my sister (which sounds like immature, manipulative BS to me). Three-- his values are completely different than my sister's, which I believe opposites attract but on fundamental things that I know my sister feels passionately about, she seems to have made herself smaller and more agreeable with some crazy views (ex: He believes lower class people cannot be trusted... and also the odd thing that he demands golden showers from my sister *who happily obliges even though I know she thinks its disgusting*).\n\nMy sister is turning into someone no one in my family can recognize, however, I don't want to lose her if it means having to accept this guy into our family. Being isolated in a toxic relationship is a scary place to be in, and i fear that if I don't invite him into the fold, she will follow him out the door. None of our family members outside the immediate know about her infidelity or even this new boyfriend. I don't want my wedding to be focused on the talk about \"what happened to her sister?\" but I really hate how she isn't supporting me, as she is one of my maids of honor and I am the first sibling to get married. My mom thinks I should invite him, as she is sympathetic towards my sister even though she also does not support her recent actions.\n\nAITA if I don't allow my sister's boyfriend to my wedding? Or do I give in to her request and invite him?\n\nEDIT:  She only asked me about his invitation *after I* sent out my table placements charts and catering count, i honestly never thought she would want him to come in the first place since our father does not want him there as well, and culture plays a big part in that. She hasn't told *anyone* about the guy except for the immediate family (parents and sisters) and she wants to use this event as the opportunity to be his \\*\\*\\*\"\\*\\*\\****big reveal\"*** \\-- if i haven't made that clear.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1689106405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14x23dh/aita_for_not_allowing_my_maid_of_honorsisters/", "score": 2016, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can do that on her own time and not take the spotlight away from you and your wedding.", "NTA -- maybe you would be if she asked you way in advance and introduced him to your family beforehand then yea you would be the asshole for not inviting him, but given the circumstances I think you're fine. Hopefully she'll get over it and suck it up for the big day, but using this event to introduce a likely controversial new addition to the family may not be the best choice and would be awkward for everyone at your family table.", "NTA - Definitely not the asshole.\n\nIt's your big day, and you should have the final say on who gets to attend. It's clear that you have valid concerns about your sister's boyfriend, especially given the circumstances of their relationship and his ongoing divorce.  If you don't feel comfortable having him there, then that's your prerogative.\n\nYour sister's reaction seems extreme, choosing not to participate in your bachelorette or bridal party just because her boyfriend isn't invited?? It's rough that she's not being supportive during this important time for you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile it's important to consider her feelings, it shouldn't come at the expense of your own happiness on your special day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe having an open conversation with your sister about your concerns and explaining your perspective might help her understand where you're coming from.

You don\u2019t have to cheer her on and you can even ask questions about whether she is sure of what she is doing and if she is happy but instead of judging her and making a lot of assumptions about the states of her past and current relationships that you are not inside of, you should just be there for her.

This is so obviously your way of punishing your sister. Guess what, there\u2019s nothing wrong with golden showers if that\u2019s what he\u2019s into.", "NTA.

Misplaced fury but fury nonetheless.", "NTA your wedding is not the moment for your sister to reveal her affair partner turned boyfriend. She can chose not to come but that will have a lasting impact on your relationship. It would not be your fault. It\u2019s her choice.", "If he is a predator you have just helped him by isolating your sister from you.", "Consider the overall atmosphere you want to create at your wedding.

It's not your place to control your siblings love life. You can't tell all the other guest their partner is welcome but your sister can't bring her boyfriend. The boyfriend doesn't need to be a part of the wedding but will one more person in the background make that much difference? Your creating a lot of ill will by making special rules for your sister.", "NTA but of course you're going to hurt your relationship with her if you don't loosen your stance on the BF. And I don't blame her for not participating in the pre-wedding festivities. You're gonna have to decide what is more important to you and you don't have the right to try and influence her relationship even if she may be making a mistake. Her bad decisions will only reflect on her and don't really affect you. Everyone will see her true colors and his, but who knows....maybe they will be happy together.", "NTA I can completely understand why you and your family don't want him there and the way you feel is absolutely valid.\n\nHaving said that I am going to play devil's advocate for a moment. Fast forward 10/20 years and think about the implications of what you have decided now. If your sister and bf are still together, which I highly doubt, and looking back at wedding photo's (I don't mean the official ones because no 8 month relation has a place being in those) it's going to feel really weird him not being there and will always be a bone of contention between you and your sister. If he is in the photo's, again not official ones, and they are no longer together the worst that will happen is you can have a good old laugh at the whole thing.\n\nIf your sister and the love of her life (/s) do split up she is going to need you and the rest of the family. Alienating her now will make it very hard for her to ask for help in the future when things inevitably go wrong. \n\nFamilies are hard, there is no right or wrong way to handle this. I don't envy you as you make your way through this minefield. You need to remember to not let this whole thing get you down and cause you stress on and in the build-up to your big day. You need it to be as happy and stress free as possible, and that may mean allowing your sisters bf to addend in some way. If you do that though, you and your family need to make it clear to your sister that this is not her day and it is not about her or her boyfriend. The whole idea of using your wedding as a way to introduce her boyfriend to friends and family is gross. \n\nGood luck with everything. You enjoy every minute of your wedding and the build-up because the day goes so fast, you don't need anyone stealing any of that time from you.", "I would only invite the bf if the bf has been with her for 3 or 4 + years.

I\u2019ve been separated for nearly two, but just haven\u2019t paid to file because I\u2019m a mature student and shit\u2019s expensive. \n\nI have a partner who I absolutely adore.

He really wanted her to go to my vow renewal and had asked multiple times.

OP wants sis to come celebrate her relationship while she shits on hers in return. I will never understand that kind of logic. And as for the edit about using OP's wedding to introduce her BF, I don't get what the big deal is. I haven't been to hundreds of weddings but I've at least been to a dozen and each and every one had at least one person introducing their new significant other. Isn't it pretty normal? It's not like he's proposing to her. If that were the case I'd totally understand not inviting them.\n\nBottom line it comes down to this: OP doesnt approve of how they got into the relationship or their \"extracurricular\" activities and therefore is using their wedding as a platform to undermine and alter their relationship.
