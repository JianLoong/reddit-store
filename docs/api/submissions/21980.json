Because I told her no, she has responded by not coming to my bachelorette or bridal party and she has not been active at all in the wedding process. She thinks that I am being an unfair asshole, as other people are bringing parters that have been together for a shorter time than her and her boyfriend.\n\nMy sister has been with her boyfriend for about 8 months-- they have traveled together and basically live together-- she is sure that she is going to marry this guy. Thing is, when they met-- she was already engaged to her partner of 10+ years whom all of my family loved deeply.  She met her new boyfriend at work, she was engaged and he was married. Essentially, they both had affairs and left their partners to be with eachother.\n\nI've met this guy and I do not like him at all. One-- he is still married and in the process of divorcing his wife-- we've all heard that before! Two-- I had an honest conversation with him asking his intentions with my sister and why he ended it with his wife. His excuse was that his previous wife \"forced\" him into the relationship and didn't know love was real until he met my sister (which sounds like immature, manipulative BS to me). Three-- his values are completely different than my sister's, which I believe opposites attract but on fundamental things that I know my sister feels passionately about, she seems to have made herself smaller and more agreeable with some crazy views (ex: He believes lower class people cannot be trusted... and also the odd thing that he demands golden showers from my sister *who happily obliges even though I know she thinks its disgusting*).\n\nMy sister is turning into someone no one in my family can recognize, however, I don't want to lose her if it means having to accept this guy into our family. Being isolated in a toxic relationship is a scary place to be in, and i fear that if I don't invite him into the fold, she will follow him out the door. None of our family members outside the immediate know about her infidelity or even this new boyfriend. I don't want my wedding to be focused on the talk about \"what happened to her sister?\" but I really hate how she isn't supporting me, as she is one of my maids of honor and I am the first sibling to get married. My mom thinks I should invite him, as she is sympathetic towards my sister even though she also does not support her recent actions.\n\nAITA if I don't allow my sister's boyfriend to my wedding? Or do I give in to her request and invite him?\n\nEDIT:  She only asked me about his invitation *after I* sent out my table placements charts and catering count, i honestly never thought she would want him to come in the first place since our father does not want him there as well, and culture plays a big part in that. She hasn't told *anyone* about the guy except for the immediate family (parents and sisters) and she wants to use this event as the opportunity to be his \\*\\*\\*\"\\*\\*\\****big reveal\"*** \\-- if i haven't made that clear.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1689106405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14x23dh/aita_for_not_allowing_my_maid_of_honorsisters/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s making it very clear she is going to choose this dude over you and it\u2019s really up to you if you want to let her cut herself off over this. Keep in mind too that if she gets in deep shit with this guy later and wants to get out, keeping the relationship with her open would allow her an avenue of escape.", "NTA, it is your wedding, you get to choose who is invited. However, be prepared for the outfall of that, i.e. she may decide not to come to your wedding at all..", "NTA, reading the edit makes it seem like this is her chance to introduce him to all the family, which is not what the gathering is for. She can do that on her own time and not take the spotlight away from you and your wedding.", "NTA -- maybe you would be if she asked you way in advance and introduced him to your family beforehand then yea you would be the asshole for not inviting him, but given the circumstances I think you're fine. Hopefully she'll get over it and suck it up for the big day, but using this event to introduce a likely controversial new addition to the family may not be the best choice and would be awkward for everyone at your family table.", "NTA - Definitely not the asshole.\n\nIt's your big day, and you should have the final say on who gets to attend. It's clear that you have valid concerns about your sister's boyfriend, especially given the circumstances of their relationship and his ongoing divorce.  If you don't feel comfortable having him there, then that's your prerogative.\n\nYour sister's reaction seems extreme, choosing not to participate in your bachelorette or bridal party just because her boyfriend isn't invited?? It's rough that she's not being supportive during this important time for you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile it's important to consider her feelings, it shouldn't come at the expense of your own happiness on your special day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe having an open conversation with your sister about your concerns and explaining your perspective might help her understand where you're coming from. Weddings can be emotionally charged events, but ultimately, the decision should be yours. The reason for the day is to celebrate ***your*** relationship-- not anyone elses.", "NTA", "I\u2019m confused why most of the comments are Y T A and all of them are at negative karma. Yeah she sounds like she\u2019s in a hell of a problem with that man. But I\u2019d not go to my sister\u2019s wedding if my partner wasn\u2019t invited. Even if she makes this grand reveal. \n\nI think this might be a case of NAH. You can invite who you want and she can decide she want\u2019s nothing to do with you. Actions have consequences. She cheated and you resent her for it. If her partner isn\u2019t invited she\u2019ll resent you. Best of luck to you.", "Using your wedding guest list as a means of casting judgment on people is gross. YTA.", "EHS. Generally I would say you should definitely give your sister and maid of honor a plus one. However your wedding is not the right place for her to make her big reveal.", "YTA. You might be right about the BF but it sounds like you\u2019re using this as an opportunity to *show* her how you feel by excluding him. \n\nYou give your guests a +1. That\u2019s it, you don\u2019t get to choose their date.", "YTA. This will backfire on your face.", "YTA. The relationship your sister is in has nothing to do with you or your wedding. It's like you're punishing her because you preferred her ex (whom she clearly didn't feel it was working with anymore). You are going to forever damage your relationship with your sister all because you can't control her life choices.", "YTA... What did you think your sister was going to do? Being a bride does not empower you to judge or police other's relationships. You say you don't want people to talk, but your actions pretty much guarantee that.", "You are really in your sister's business! YTA, it's her decision to date this guy, no matter what you think. Isolating her further won't help.", "A soft YTA.  I get how upset your family must be about this relationship.  That said, I'm quite certain you're not judging any of the other \"Plus 1s\" who are invited to your wedding and the same should apply to her.", "YTA - does everyone\u2019s plus ones have to pass your morality test to be invited or is this only your sister?", "YTA. You don\u2019t like that your sister isn\u2019t supporting you while you refuse to support her. It\u2019s that simple. Even if this is a bad decision or a series of bad decisions, your role is to be there for her and be a positive person in her life. Not to be the judge of her relationships. You don\u2019t have to cheer her on and you can even ask questions about whether she is sure of what she is doing and if she is happy but instead of judging her and making a lot of assumptions about the states of her past and current relationships that you are not inside of, you should just be there for her. Because that\u2019s what you want, right? Her to be there for your wedding even if she knows about times you weren\u2019t happy with the guy you are marrying, ways you have changed and compromised because of your relationship, and maybe even if she doesn\u2019t even like him as much as you assume she does. Invite whoever you want to your wedding and leave whoever you want off the guest list, but don\u2019t expect people to just offer you unfettered, unconditional support in your relationship and events like your wedding when you aren\u2019t doing the same.", "YTA my best friend did this to me. She had met my bf and even invited over for game night several times. We had been dating for about 7 months. However when we met he was legally married but had been separated from his wife for a year.
