Her family were super happy for us but mine were less so. My siblings were fine, though they all think I'm too young to get engaged (I'm 23). My parents are where the problem arise. They were always a little surprised that my fianc\u00e9e's name is actually Lyric. When they first met her they asked what her real name was. They dropped it but I could tell there was a wtf going on in their heads. I told them they had such a strong reaction. They said they had never met someone with the name before. I pointed out that they had, just one person but still. They were never outright rude to her though so I kept an eye on things between them and she didn't feel like they were weird with her or rude, and I checked in with her when we were around my family, just to be sure.\n\nIt was only when we announced the engagement that my parents told me I couldn't possibly marry someone named Lyric, and what would people think about me being married to one of those people who was given a ridiculous name by her parents and who chose to keep it as an adult instead of changing it to an actual name vs something her parents decided would make her cool and stand out. They said this is the real world and people named Lyric, Ryder, Jayden, Skye, Meadow, Rosie, Indie, Katniss, Khaleesi, Brynley, Honey, etc are the kind of people who get passed up for jobs and mocked behind their backs and pitied for sticking with something their parents saddled them with. They told me they did not want me to marry someone named Lyric and I could find a respectable person who was not white trailer trash and clearly out to be an embarrassment to herself by proudly holding onto a name like Lyric.\n\nI told my parents they were wrong to say that and I would not let them just insult Lyric like that without consequence. They said it's her parents they feel more disgusted by but clearly she has been a bad influence and what about my future kids with Lyric. Are they supposed to just accept having a little Apple, Zoo and Ireland running around. They said they could not honestly accept a Lyric into the family. I told them they were being so judgmental and harsh on Lyric and her parents and the parents who use names they don't like in general when they are the people who create problems in the first place. I said it was disgusting that they were being so awful about this and to imply that Lyric isn't good enough because of her name shows how nasty and judgmental they are. I told them they should look at themselves before judging others like that. I told them it was them I was embarrassed by, not Lyric.\n\nI also told them not to worry about welcoming Lyric into the family because we wouldn't want to be part of their family. I walked away from them at that point. And I blocked them but they got to my siblings who said I should never have insulted our parents and I should be grown enough to handle an argument better.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698750586, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17kiib6/aita_for_insulting_my_parents_after_they_said/", "score": 159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
