Her family were super happy for us but mine were less so. My siblings were fine, though they all think I'm too young to get engaged (I'm 23). My parents are where the problem arise. They were always a little surprised that my fianc\u00e9e's name is actually Lyric. When they first met her they asked what her real name was. They dropped it but I could tell there was a wtf going on in their heads. I told them they had such a strong reaction. They said they had never met someone with the name before. I pointed out that they had, just one person but still. They were never outright rude to her though so I kept an eye on things between them and she didn't feel like they were weird with her or rude, and I checked in with her when we were around my family, just to be sure.\n\nIt was only when we announced the engagement that my parents told me I couldn't possibly marry someone named Lyric, and what would people think about me being married to one of those people who was given a ridiculous name by her parents and who chose to keep it as an adult instead of changing it to an actual name vs something her parents decided would make her cool and stand out. They said this is the real world and people named Lyric, Ryder, Jayden, Skye, Meadow, Rosie, Indie, Katniss, Khaleesi, Brynley, Honey, etc are the kind of people who get passed up for jobs and mocked behind their backs and pitied for sticking with something their parents saddled them with. They told me they did not want me to marry someone named Lyric and I could find a respectable person who was not white trailer trash and clearly out to be an embarrassment to herself by proudly holding onto a name like Lyric.\n\nI told my parents they were wrong to say that and I would not let them just insult Lyric like that without consequence. They said it's her parents they feel more disgusted by but clearly she has been a bad influence and what about my future kids with Lyric. Are they supposed to just accept having a little Apple, Zoo and Ireland running around. They said they could not honestly accept a Lyric into the family. I told them they were being so judgmental and harsh on Lyric and her parents and the parents who use names they don't like in general when they are the people who create problems in the first place. I said it was disgusting that they were being so awful about this and to imply that Lyric isn't good enough because of her name shows how nasty and judgmental they are. I told them they should look at themselves before judging others like that. I told them it was them I was embarrassed by, not Lyric.\n\nI also told them not to worry about welcoming Lyric into the family because we wouldn't want to be part of their family. I walked away from them at that point. And I blocked them but they got to my siblings who said I should never have insulted our parents and I should be grown enough to handle an argument better.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698750586, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17kiib6/aita_for_insulting_my_parents_after_they_said/", "score": 1380, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Fuck, why the hell do we have only three names per gender in a class of 24?\u201d", "I mean, they also condemned Rosie, which is a completely average name and basically the English equivalent of (and frequently mistaken for) my own name.", "Technically, Lyric is one from Ancient Greek and is derived from the classics. It literally refers to \"Lyre.\"  That being said, it is an odd name if you come from a Catholic or traditional Christian background. In Catholicism, you pretty much are stuck with saint names. I think it is odd, but she is fine with it and her beau is fine with it, and that's all that counts.  She would fit in better in the Astoria of my youth where Pandora and Calliope were common names. In Whitebread America, maybe not, but it's no biggie.", "Silly stuff.  I remember having a conversation with a coworker whose name was \"Hartsopedes\" who had it legally changed to Hart, and one of my best friends was Lubishaw Milenkovich, known as \"Mike.\"  If Lyric doesn't like her name she can choose another, use the middle name or just sign as L... so and so.  It's no big deal. Since she is happy, mom and dad can screw off.", "Or Aria.", "Lol I was looking for someone pointing this out, who would look at someone named Rosie and go \u201coof yikes not hiring her, that name\u2019s way too unprofessional\u201d??", "It\u2019s lovely.\n\nSame as \u201cMelody\u201d", "Oh ffs, I should know better than to think my hyperbole is too crazy for other humans to ever actually validate.", "She denied using alcohol and said she \u201chadn\u2019t used methamphetamine or fentanyl in a week.\u201d", "The vast majority of South Africans know who Hitler was.\n\nMaybe Trevor Noah grew up around very ignorant people.", "*The Fianc\u00e9e Formerly Known as Lyric*", "I would say it also shows a lack of commitment to treatment and recovery, if someone is jumping in to serious relationships only three months clean. They're still struggling with impulse control.", "YES! So so accurate when I was in elementary! Multiple Melissa's and Jennifers.  There were a few of us unique peeps. Mine is a normal name but I go by the shortened version of it so the only other person at the time was a boy until highschool.", "They don't like her. It's been 5 years already. The parents sound like awful people who are incredibly out of touch.", "That's the one that gets me. Rosie. How is that strange at all?", "Right. I live fairly close to Astoria and I'm thinking these parents would find a visit to the Pacific Northwest pretty stressful. The names OP mentions they disapproved of can be found on lawyers, surgeons, business owners... I know a cop named Skye.", "I\u2019m white, 35, and grew up way upper middle class.  I picked the name \u201cLyric\u201d for my future daughter when I was in the fourth grade, after finding it in a baby name book when my family was trying to pick the perfect name for our puppy when he was old enough to leave his mother. \n\nSo this really isn\u2019t a new name, and I can almost guarantee my parents made more money than OP\u2019s, so class isn\u2019t a question either.", "I knew a woman who was named Guelfe. She ended up changing her name to Gail when she was an adult.", "That's the limiting factor with fiction, it needs to make sense and be believable.", "There are some people who despise nicknames. In their eyes, \"Rosie\" is only proper as \"Rosalyn\" or similar.", "Yeah.  In Astoria, Lyric would come via the old country, not hippy/dippy. I think the parents have to get out more."]}
