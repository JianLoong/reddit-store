Many accounts held for minors, like an inheritance if someone dies prematurely, are not distributed until age 25 because it's just a fact of life that teens can blow though years of savings without much thought.", "NTA but baby those savings are GONE.", "NTA. You're an adult now and you're entitled to manage your own money. You should be able to go to the bank and cut off her access so that you're the only one with control over your money. \n\nUnless you have a history of reckless spending, she needs to let go without being mad.", "NTA\n\nSadly, giving other people your money to save for you (even your parents) often doesn\u2019t work out.   It seems likely your mother spent your savings, perhaps thinking she would have time to replace the money before you came looking for it.  It\u2019s a big breach of trust and you\u2019d have a right to be upset. \n\nI would ask her outright if that is what happened.  Make it clear that she needs to pay you back, even if it\u2019s just a little bit every month.  \n\nAlso, open a personal savings account in your name only.", "NTA - but if you went into the agreement for her to help you set aside a certain amount in savings was for a particular goal (tuition, first home, etc), I can understand her reluctance. I can even see a discussion of the need to adjust your expenses to deal with the impact of inflation. However, the money is yours. You have every right to it.\n\nIf you have a plan. Share it with your mom. Should would probably appreciate that you are thinking things through. If it\u2019s a concern of access in case of emergency, as you stated, I would think making sure you could transfer the money to your checking is a far more desirable option than a high interest credit card or payday loan would be.", "it is your money, what you do with it, is of no concern to her.\n\nnta", "NTA, and your mother, ironically, is behaving in a way that encourages spending problems rather than alleviating them. If you\u2019ve never had control over your own money, it\u2019s much more difficult to develop good spending habits as an adult with free reign than as a young teen managing an allowance.

Don\u2019t divide all the money you have so it\u2019s gone by the last month of school, Just try to figure out a nominal amount that you can get by with. \n\nYou\u2019ll have some spending money and you\u2019ll also still have some savings when you graduate.

Even if she kept the money, her refusal still means she's denying you access to your own money, so it's still stealing from you. Your mother is not how you think she is. NTA. Sorry, but say good bye to that money. Get your own account NOW and never give her any money again."]}
