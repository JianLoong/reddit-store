OP is not the one making that choice.", "She HAD the opportunity to respect others at her dad and to modify her behaviour right now, if not, she will have 30 days to move out.", "It would be the random men issue for me, too. There is no telling what they might do. They could rob them, assault them of hell, even kill them. I would not be doing that at all, let alone continuing to do it after my roommate asked me not it to do it.\n\nNTA.", "This is my concern. I wouldn't *like* my kid/sibling coming home intoxicated at all hours, but you're an adult and can make choices. A string of one night stands you picked up while drunk is a really good way to get robbed.", "Even if they don't do any of this, as OP, I wouldn't want to have to worry about running into some strange guy in my bathroom or kitchen if I get up in the middle of the night.", "It\u2019s very apparent you\u2019ve never lived with someone like that\n\nYou\u2019d make a great enabler", "Are you the sister?

Is your sister not letting you bring random men back to the house for anonymous sex or something? Seems this one really hit close to home.", "I think the idea is that if the sister is otherwise functional in life there\u2019s a good chance she\u2019s not actually an alcoholic/addict and would just stop the partying when faced with this ultimatum rather than being so committed to it that she ends up homeless. If it actually comes down to it where the sister keeps doing it until the day before the deadline (and she is going to be actually homeless and not \u201ccrashing on her friend from high school\u2019s couch\u201d homeless), then I agree they need to look into getting her rehab or something.", "Not quite sure what about this post makes you think OP is not trying to help sister. They are providing her place to live and guidance on how to not be a dimwit. They are not immediately jumping to throwing out either, like you are projecting. They are saying either stop bringing the guys here or that will be the consequence. \n\nThere are other places to fuck guys. But even still following your advice of \u2018try to help someone\u2019 OP should keep a firm hand and not allow the nonsense to continue. Allowing the nonsense to continue doesn\u2019t help anyone. It just reinforces the idea that the behavior is appropriate. \n\nLike someone else said, a lot of information is missing. Is sister contributing? Is she going to school or work? Or is partying and sleeping in the majority of her behavior? I think these are all factors at play.", "ESH, everyone talking about putting you in danger, too, is crazy. The only point that matters is she doesn't pay rent and you do. I would never dream of telling a roommate they couldn't bring Tinder dates back to the house. It's an outrageous demand, but she doesn't pay rent, so she can't dictate it.", "NTA", "It\u2019s your house and your rules, how dare she assume she can have some random men wandering about in YOUR house. She sounds very entitled and spoilt. \n\nSounds as tho that 30 day eviction notice needs to be put in use, you know she\u2019s not going to change her behaviour.

She lives there too, does she pay rent?  Utilities? Food?  And why wouldn\u2019t you ask your father why she was kicked out before even considering letting her move in with you?  Sis is right.  She is an adult.  One who can find a place to live on her own and live by her rules.  Kick her to the curb.", "NTA. \u201cI live here too\u201d doesn\u2019t mean getting to bring around random men etc, it\u2019s your house and she needs to respect you don\u2019t want strangers there", "Im leaning towards N T A, but I need some INFO: have you tried enough conversations with her before jumping to an ultimatum? How have you framed your points? Have you made it clear the issue is not about her behavior outside, but especially bringing strange men to your house, that it is out of concern not only about her safety but also yours? I know she's an adult and you're not her parent, but she's pretty young, and also reddit loves to jump to kicking out, as if it isn't some serious decision.", "NTA- you do get to control it because it\u2019s your house..

You aren\u2019t her parent, but it is your house where you set the rules. Bringing strangers into the house is a risk that you are not obligated to accept. Many people rightfully would object due to the risk of theft or other potential issues such as drug, assault, etc I am also concerned about her drinking, and wonder if she may be an alcoholic. Anyway, she is being childish when she complains that your dad won\u2019t let her be an adult. Quite the contrary, your dad won\u2019t let her behave like a self-indulgent child, and neither should you.", "NTA\n\nIf you live with people, you run guests by them first, especially overnight guests. As long as you\u2019re not shaming her for what sounds like hookups, just setting the boundaries to keep you safe and comfortable in your own home, then you\u2019re absolutely in the right.

These dudes could steal from you, set someone else to steal from you, destroy your home, physically hurt you, etc. i would just make her move out at this point she sounds soiled entitled and like she needs a reality check.", "NTA She\u2019s a grown ass adult and can take responsibility for her own actions and follow basic rules of respecting your property. You\u2019re allowing her to live with you. It\u2019s fine to not expect random sexual partners be brought into your home on a regular basis. It\u2019s completely reasonable to expect a certain level of privacy and safety in your own home. Honestly, if she\u2019s wishing to treat your home as some kind of college party house then I\u2019d be expecting her to find suitable living arrangements to meet that criteria. It would not be in my family home.", "NTA\n\nMy house, my rules.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to control her activities outside the house, including drinking, but you have the right to tell her no hookups at home.", "NTA. Now you know why her dad kicked her out", "NTA. Your sister is playing with her life, and putting you at risk as well.

It is your house and it is completely understandable that you don't want her to undertake risky behaviour while she's living at your house. Not to make bringing home strangers.

Your house your rules. This would make me incredibly nervous too. Randos over at all hours?! No thanks.

Before letting her stay you should have talked to dad.", "NTA - some people feel the need to get drunk and party in their twenties. I never really understood why, but each to their own. The simple fact is it's your home, not her party pad. If that's what she's looking for she can go get somewhere else to live. You're a grown woman who probably doesn't want to do the whole random guy in your house, not just because it's dangerous. If she can't respect that she needs to go.", "This seems super fair. If she's an adult she can go be an \"adult\" in her own home with her own money.", "NTA. Even if you pay rent which she doesn\u2019t?, you don\u2019t get to do crazy crap. Also, why wait.

Your house, your rules and whatnot.

Either she'll quit or she'll leave.", "Sounds like she parties too much. NTA", "Exactly! This was a very easy one for me. Bringing strange men into your home let at night is putting OP's safety at risk.

And it worked, I did all that and did what I want in my twenties - before accepting I have to adult now and taking time to see what that looks like for me in my thirties. \n\nGood luck to your sister, NTA you (as a family) just need to be clear on the life lesson to her - she will come back when it clicks for her, assuming you all can part in healthy ways as a family imho. For me that means let her leave the nest and guide her in that, instead of kicking her out and essentially leaving her with her judgment as the only guide she has imho. If nobody is there to calmly point out the flaw in her logic, she will end up alone and in the hands of those who will use her flawed logic and broken relationships to their advantage. Or no one but vices by her side. It\u2019s very rare to see someone who thrived from that - that\u2019s why we applaud those people who can overcome their pasts and/or past mistakes.
