Respect that someone else lives in that space or gfto\n\nAs other people pointed out she wouldn\u2019t be able to do stuff like that if it was a roommate and not family. You living in a space doesn\u2019t mean you get to cross the boundaries of the other inhabitants", "She's not being thrown to the wolves, she's inviting the wolves into OPs House. OP then gave her a choice, me or them. OP is not the one making that choice.", "She HAD the opportunity to respect others at her dad and to modify her behaviour right now, if not, she will have 30 days to move out.", "It would be the random men issue for me, too. There is no telling what they might do. They could rob them, assault them of hell, even kill them. I would not be doing that at all, let alone continuing to do it after my roommate asked me not it to do it.\n\nNTA.", "This is my concern. I wouldn't *like* my kid/sibling coming home intoxicated at all hours, but you're an adult and can make choices. A string of one night stands you picked up while drunk is a really good way to get robbed.", "Even if they don't do any of this, as OP, I wouldn't want to have to worry about running into some strange guy in my bathroom or kitchen if I get up in the middle of the night.", "It\u2019s very apparent you\u2019ve never lived with someone like that\n\nYou\u2019d make a great enabler", "Are you the sister? Sheesh. You seem entirely too emotionally invested in this senario...", "Jesus you\u2019ve got issues man. Is your sister not letting you bring random men back to the house for anonymous sex or something? Seems this one really hit close to home.", "I think the idea is that if the sister is otherwise functional in life there\u2019s a good chance she\u2019s not actually an alcoholic/addict and would just stop the partying when faced with this ultimatum rather than being so committed to it that she ends up homeless. If it actually comes down to it where the sister keeps doing it until the day before the deadline (and she is going to be actually homeless and not \u201ccrashing on her friend from high school\u2019s couch\u201d homeless), then I agree they need to look into getting her rehab or something.", "Not quite sure what about this post makes you think OP is not trying to help sister. They are providing her place to live and guidance on how to not be a dimwit. They are not immediately jumping to throwing out either, like you are projecting. They are saying either stop bringing the guys here or that will be the consequence. \n\nThere are other places to fuck guys. But even still following your advice of \u2018try to help someone\u2019 OP should keep a firm hand and not allow the nonsense to continue. Allowing the nonsense to continue doesn\u2019t help anyone. It just reinforces the idea that the behavior is appropriate. \n\nLike someone else said, a lot of information is missing. Is sister contributing? Is she going to school or work? Or is partying and sleeping in the majority of her behavior? I think these are all factors at play."]}
