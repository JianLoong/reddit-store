Do it. \n\nIf her name isn't on the lease, she has no say. You don't need random men in your place who might actually be casing your place for theft or worse.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She has every right to party and sleep with random guys. You have every right to not allow her to live in your house.", "NTA. It's pretty clear why your dad kicked her out. As long as you keep providing a place for her, she has zero incentive to change her behavior.", "NTA - Kick her out. It's dangerous for you too.", "NTA your house your rules.  Not to mention that she is putting your safety at risk by bringing home men she barely knows.\n\nTell her to move in with some of her party friends, birds of a feather etc.", "NTA. Sister is an adult. She needs a place with likeminded people or a place by herself. Not even an issue. She can Move.", "NTA - baby sister is playing with fire", "NTA - this is a safety issue.", "NTA. She needs to respect that it\u2019s your house. If you don\u2019t want random people at your house it\u2019s okay to say no. If she doesn\u2019t want to abide, that\u2019s her decision to make when she\u2019s living in her own space and not in someone else\u2019s home.", "Absolutely NTA for what you asked. She\u2019s living rent free and creating a nuisance. You\u2019re not obligated to care for her or deal with her habits. You\u2019re already going out on a limb to help and she\u2019s taking advantage.", "NTA, that\u2019s your house, your rules\n\nand your half-sister needs to chill out or else she will waste her 20s", "NTA. You are not obligated to bring toxic, unhealthy behavior into your house.", "Absolutely NTA. Her behavior is dangerous and not at all adult-like. She needs to grow up. She is putting both your lives at risk by bringing home strange men. Kick her out.", "NTA: That's a no-brainer. She is risking your safety bringing random dudes into your home. Oh h#ll NO!", "Does she pay rent? Utilities? Groceries? Because if the answer to all of those is no then she isn't an adult that lives there, she's an adult you're LETTING stay there.  And even if she where part of being an adult is knowing how to compromise and not making your housemates uncomfortable by wrecking your shared home. If she want's to live by her own rules that she can do it under her own roof. NTA.", "NTA She's perfectly fine to do what she's doing, and she can do that somewhere else. You are under no obligation to allow her to bring strange men into your house. She's an adult that needs to grow up.", "NTA\n\nThis is a safety issue. One of the men she brings home could very easily rape and/or kill both of you. Don\u2019t relent. Your life could be at stake.", "I\u2019m genuinely curious what you thought someone who just reached drinking age and wanted to get away from her parent and move in with you to \u201cbe an adult\u201d was going to do when given the freedom?\n\nAsshole or not, you\u2019ve been twenty one. You know what twenty one year olds do when they get out on their own. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re surprised.", "NAH. She's 21 and gets to sleep with who she wants and party (I mean hopefully she knows how to be safe both with both control and with meeting these guys) but you also don't have to want that in your home even though it's your sister.", "Info: is your sister paying rent? If yes, then you would be the AH cuz she\u2019s an adult and can do what she likes. \n\nIf not, then N TA. Your house, your rules.", "You know that if you throw her out she\u2019s going to end up staying with one of these dudes she\u2019s bringing home rather than go back to your dad now that she\u2019s had a taste of freedom and likely end up in a much worse situation.\n\nYou could try, y\u2019know, talking to her. She\u2019ll probably listen to you if you come at this correctly. At the least she\u2019ll be more discreet.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She is only considering what she wants. Give her the 30 days notice.", "NTA. It's your house, you absolutely get a say in who comes into it, especially if it's random people she just met.", "NTA-there should be some ground rules in place", "Probably should have asked your dad for some information first. NTA. Let her find her own apartment to party in.", "op=NTA\n\nYou are within your rights(and I'm betting sis isn't paying rent--tho of course I could be wrong....)", "NTA, there's really nothing else to it. Travelling drunk and bringing strangers home are bad enough- Forget doing it to family, I wouldn't even do that to a roommate.", "NTA.\n\nTime for her to learn (since you let her off the first time), that being an adult doing whatever they want, does not mean they can do whatever they want without consequences.", "I agree. Throw her to the wolves. What kind of sucker cares about family.", "Happy cake day", "Errrr, that\u2019s what you might have done when you were 21.

Op shouldn't have to sacrifice her safety here.", "Doubtful that she\u2019ll be staying with one of the dudes that that she\u2019s bringing home. Otherwise, she would just be going home with them if they had their own place lol.", "What kind of sucker lets family take advantage of them simply for being family? I would hope OP's sister would see reason first, but if not, then OP has a choice to make.", "Obviously, the party girl sister does not care about the rest of her family at all.", "Personally, if someone I care about is on an obviously self-destructive path, especially if it\u2019s because they\u2019re young and dumb and I\u2019m much older, I\u2019m gonna take a big swing at trying to help them before I throw them away like garbage to live on the streets.\n\nApologies in advance for having actual feelings about people I care about and not living my life like a GTA character.", "I agree. Throw her on the street posthaste. She deserves to suffer for not having her shit together at twenty-one like you and basically everyone else commenting on this post apparently did. And it\u2019s even more impressive that you\u2019ve all ended up here never having done that considering that the vast, vast majority of college age kids act like fucking idiots.", "Yours is a perfectly valid choice to make. I would do the same, and have been there for family for years even when they screwed around and stole thousands of dollars from me. But I also stand by my vote. OP isn't obligated to be the one to try to fix her sister. Sometimes it's better in the long run to not be a crutch for someone's bad behavior.", "I lived on the street at one point, so I know the alternative.   She needs an ultimatum: Follow the rules or GTFO.\n\nIf she doesn't want to follow them, then that's her own problem.   She can go to the random dudes house instead for her escapades if she wants rather than her sister's place.   It's called respect.", "No. If you care about someone, you try to help them before you make them homeless. If OP is cool with not giving a fuck whether her sister lives or dies, fine. If she does care, she\u2019s obliged to take a swing here.\n\nThis is a young adult drinking too much and having sex. She\u2019s not stealing, she\u2019s not a junkie, she\u2019s doing the same shit that tons of people do at her age. But no, everyone hits 27-28 and forgets what ridiculous nitwit they were then.", "That's fair. I'm more concerned about bringing home strange people than the partying, but you are right about that. She could be doing much worse things.\n\nOf course, there's a lot of information missing here. For instance, is the sister contributing financially, or being supported by OP? If the sister is contributing, I lean more strongly in your direction. If not, she has no excuse for being a freeloader.\n\nIf you were in this situation and nothing changed as time went by, is there a point where you would cut them off? 5 years? 10? Or would you give them as long as it took?", "NTA sister needs to be an adult in her own place. In other people\u2019s homes she follow their rules.. \n\n           \u201cYou must pay the cost to be the boss\u201d\nCertainly applies in this post.", "NTA for being mad that she\u2019s bringing home random guys. \n\nBut honestly coming home late drunk is pretty typical for that age. As long as she isn\u2019t being loud when she gets home or drinking and driving to get back then that seems pretty standard.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n> she says she lives here too and I don't get to control who she has over or when.\n\nThis is how you find yourself without a room or roommates.\n\nPart of being an adult is learning not to be an asshole to people you live with, ESPECIALLY if it\u2019s a favor.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister wants to be treated like an adult? Then she should behave like one.\n\nIf she wants to party hard and make risky choices, she needs to find roommates who are ok with this behaviour, or move out on her own.\n\nThe stupid thing is, her choices are extremely immature. She's not doing good adulting.", "NTA.  You are not her parent and she is not a child.", "NTA but it seems like she needs a sister to sister talk.", "Honestly coming home late drunk is pretty common for that age.", "Maybe she'll learn then!"]}
