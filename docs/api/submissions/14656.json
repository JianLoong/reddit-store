She could be doing much worse things.\n\nOf course, there's a lot of information missing here. For instance, is the sister contributing financially, or being supported by OP?

Does she understand that bringing random people home she put both of you in danger?  You do have a few things you can do.

She is simply telling you that you have to adjust to her, in your own home?", "NTA - I don\u2019t  care about her choices, but I would feel uncomfortable about bringing random variables (recently met people, intoxication) to my home. It is not such a matter of judging her choices as much as evaluating incompatibility of shared space expectations. \n\nI think 21 and 30+ are very different life stages and it makes sense to want stability, and not to live together if she doesn\u2019t want to commit to that level whilst exploring her relatively new adulthood.", "A whole 30 days?

Shitty situation overall.", "Her sister is putting her at risk of assault, rape (two for one), and theft by bringing strange men back to her house. That's pretty shitty behaviour from anyone.
