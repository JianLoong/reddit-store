I haven\u2019t posted here much. And I am an atheist put through catholic schools, so it\u2019s not really my religion. \n\nA lot of context is necessary for this one. My father has been single for 12 years after my mother passed in 2009. He is also disabled and has been since the 90\u2019s well before I was born. Due to this accident, he is a very gullible man. \nRecently, my father married a woman he met three months prior in January of this year. He refused to listen to any of his children when we suggested he give it some more time to think It through. He didn\u2019t see the warning signs we were seeing. \n\nHow fast their relationship was going sounded like the stuff you hear off dateline. He\u2019s moving in with her, she cuts him off from his family, etc. We were worried and expressed concern, but all this seemed to do was fuel her convincing him that it was us, his children, who are all working jobs to support ourselves, who we\u2019re the ones who were really after his money. And she convinced him so well that he sold the house he and my brother, who was caring for him since he was disabled, were living in right out from under my brother. Essentially he only got a week warning to get all his stuff out when he was promised a month. All because she didn\u2019t like that my brother is gay because she\u2019s a \u201cwoman of god\u201d. And my father stopped helping me with my insurance, at 18 I was legally independent, despite him having promised to help me until I was out of schooling. She said he shouldn\u2019t be paying for that stuff because she didn\u2019t pay for her kids after they turned 18, and that was unfair to her kids. \n\nLiteral days after they were married, they dropped 50k on a new SUV and gave his 2016 Lexus to one of her adult kids, despite me still driving a 2009 Toyota. And I don\u2019t mean that in any way we ever wanted him unhappy, but the way things were headed really sounded like it was straight off dateline. In the end, he has regretted cutting us off and wants us to talk to him, but won\u2019t admit any fault fault of his for what he did to my brother. \n\nWhen my brother and his boyfriend got engaged more recently they sent the picture of the rings to him to try and share their joy with him, only for our \u201cfather\u201d to post them on Facebook publicly to claim how \u201cungodly\u201d, and how \u201cmanipulative\u201d my brother was, and when so many friends and family from over the years commented he was wrong, he blocked us all. As a student of Catholic schools, and an attendee of Catholic Church, I did decide to write him a nice text with direct cited quotes from the Bible to show him how even if he disagrees with the relationship, he will be judged just as harshly as he has judged my brother when he gets to heaven, and how only those free of sin can make those kinds of judgments. The only thing he could say back to me is that I drank at Christmas. As a 21 year old. Despite his new wife being drunker than me that night and her posting pictures of how drunk she was on Facebook. Talk about a double standard! \n\nSo am I the asshole at the end of the day for telling him that he wasn\u2019t being a true follower of Christ?", "created_utc": 1667199053, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi385d/aita_for_telling_my_father_that_he_is_being/", "score": 426, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let him deal with the mess and misery he created, he deserves it.", "NTA But that\u2019s not really the best way to get through to him.

One the Bible tells parents to love their children. You are supposed to love everyone. Nowhere does it say that you are allowed to stop loving someone when they are being sinful. Now yes, it's alright to point out someone else's sin if you don't have any of your own. Another verse you probably should have added was the verse about trying to remove a speck from someone else's eye while you have a plank in yours. Not sure where that is. I believe Jesus said it though. I don't try to point out other people's sin because I still struggle with sins of my own. A lot of Christians are judgmental and those people are usually either misinformed or they aren't actually Christians. Your dad sounded offended when you used that verse. I would call his salvation into question. If he was actually a Christian, he wouldn't be offended by it. If he was actually a Christian and just misinformed, he would be grateful for it. Too many people wear the name Christian just for the name alone and not actually following it.
