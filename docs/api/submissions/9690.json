The rubber gloves I use for cooking are a different pair to the ones I use for washing dishes. I never mix them up.\n\nI had relatives come over and they saw me cooking and were immediately disgusted and saying that they weren't going anything I made if I was using rubber gloves, how could I serve my mother food like this etc. \nI was hurt, because I only use them because I don't want my skin condition to affect anything. And I don't see how using clean rubber gloves is different than those rubber coverings you get to put over bowls or plates of leftover food.\nMy mum didn't defend me and just told me to get rid of the gloves as well.\n\nI told them if they had this big of an issue, they could cook but they said that wasn't the point. I told them about my psoriasis and they said that wasn't the point. \nMy mother is technically capable of making food herself. She can serve herself breakfast and make freezer food but she chooses not to because she's gotten used to coddling, being enabled and this lifestyle. I want her to have some amount of independence so normally she makes her breakfast (cereal, toast etc) while i make lunch and dinner. \n\nBecause of my relatives reaction, I make dinner and lunch 5 days out of 7, instead of the full week.

As long as you wash and sanitize before, during, and after each use and store your gloves in a clean place after each use there is probably minimal concern for you and your mother's health. If you notice any rips, tears, wear, etc., you should replace them immediately.\n\nAdditional note: You're a saint and 19 is too young to get tied down being a permanent caregiver to someone you didn't bring into this world, imo.

I will give them one thing, and one thing only, and that\u2019s that the mental image of someone cooking and touching food in rubber gloves is a little gross, just because I normally see gloves like that being used for deep cleaning, scrubbing toilets, etc.  The mental association is rubber gloves = dirty.  \n\nThey should have accepted your explanation and shut up, so you\u2019re still NTA, but I get the gross out factor.", "Sooooo.
