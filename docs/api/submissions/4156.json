We'd usually spend the holidays with my side of family.\n\n\nWe checked the schedule and she's \"supposed\" to have the kids during christmas. All 4 of them which I thought was unfair to me and my family. especially my mother since she can't enjoy the holidays without her grandchildren.\n\n\nI called their mom and suggested that she let me have 2 of our children spend christmas with me and family while she has the other 2. She refused but I told her it's the best compromise. She said something about not wanting the kids to spend christmas away from each others but I explained how miserable me and my family would be this christmas if none of the kids is around. She said no and that I needed to prioritize the kids feelings above mine and my family's but I told her that this compromise is the best we could come up with. We got into an arguement and she insisted she won't let the kids be separated on christmas and that if I have an \"issue\" with that then I need to go to court. I snapped and in a moment of anger told her that no one can tell me when I get to see my kids, called her bitter and selfish then she hung up.\n\n\nI tried to call her mother hoping she'd reason with her but she instead shamed me for being \"willing\" to separate the kids from each others just so I could \"please my family\". and said that her daughter is doing whats best for the kids.

Not to mention the favouritism that would come with whichever 2 you ended up picking.\n\nAlso, they're your ex and your ex's family kids too. They're just as entitled to family time with them during the holidays as you are.\n\nEdit: typos", "\u2018I snapped and in a moment of anger told her that no one can tell me when I get to see my kids\u2019\n\nAnd yet here is your ex and the court telling you just that.

I totally understand the divorce, seems like you care far more about your feelings and your mother\u2019s than you could about your ex or your own children.", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t separate kids on Christmas.  Spending that time with my siblings was one of the best things and you deciding that forever while their kids (cause that\u2019s what this would be you alternating kids every year) is the selfish act.  You get the kids next year, that\u2019s the result of being divorced.  If you live close together maybe do Christmas Eve or the day after.  \n\n\n\nYour mother\u2019s feelings are irrelevant.", "YTA. Don\u2019t separate your kids on Christmas, I\u2019m sure this is all hard enough on them as it is. As for your mother who \u2018can\u2019t enjoy Christmas without her grandchildren\u2019 well she better figure out how to because that\u2019s how divorce works. You will not get them to yourself every single Christmas.", "YTA\nYou\u2019re a terrible father for wanting to separate the kids like that. What the hell is wrong with you? \nI hope that your ex shares this with her lawyer and it reflects poorly on you. \n\nYour mother is selfish too, btw, idk what kind of mother would be ok with that. Shame on you both.", "YTA, you call your wife bitter and selfish yet you're the one selfishly putting your feelings and feelings of your mother over your children, and verbally attacking someone when they point that out.", "It has been figured out, you're the one who doesn't understand that. The custody agreement says that she has the kids this year for Xmas. I'm quite positive that you'll get to have them for Xmas next year. YTA.", "YTA. There is a schedule. That IS the compromise you negotiated. You\u2019re divorced, this is your reality now, you share custody. Threatening and bullying does not change the agreement, it will just make it more likely that your ex can get full custody. And splitting up the kids is ridiculous.", "YTA\n\nIf you think kids are emotional support pets for your mother, then your mother is unhinged and needs therapy, and I can see why you\u2019re divorced.\n\nYou\u2019re a parent, you\u2019re supposed to put your childrens needs above your own and your parents. You and your mother are spectacularly selfish.\n\nIf this was a problem you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to it. Custody agreements are legally binding.", "YTA one thousand times over!

They are not some kind of property THEY ARE YOUR CHILDREN.\n\nHow is splitting siblings up a compromise!? A real compromise is having separate Christmas dinner on different days.\n\nYou are making it all about you and your family and you aren't thinking of the children's feelings.

Big time! Being spilt between two homes is really hard for kids, and they should not be separated on the holidays on top of it. The court can and will tell you when you can have your visitation, so you better get used to that, fast. It\u2019s the consequences of divorce, and maybe you should have looked into that before acting entitled. You don\u2019t get to say anymore. Next year, your ex won\u2019t have the kids for Christmas and you will. You have a parenting plan for a reason.", "YTA. Your wife is right. You want to spilt the kids for you, not for them. This is wrong. Do you want to create drama and jealousy between your kids? Do you want them to have less memories together ? This is what you are trying to do. The only fair thing is one of you have them on Christmas Eve and the other on Christmas Day. Christmas is just a date, you can celebrate on any day with kids", "YTA \n\nWhy can\u2019t you just celebrate with the kids when it IS your day? Christmas is a spirit and a season and it doesn\u2019t have to be on December 25th exclusively. \n\nWhen I was in college, we celebrated Christmas in January almost every year because it was cheaper for me to fly home the week after New Years. Did my parents care? No. They just kept the fake tree up a little longer and we cooked our \u201cChristmas foods\u201d in early January instead. \n\nYou, and your mother, are being incredibly selfish and cruel, both to your ex but more importantly to your children. I\u2019m glad their mother is holding her ground and refusing to separate the children. \n\nNo wonder y\u2019all split up. Do better.", "This is a joke right?!

She didn\u2019t but that was mostly bc she didn\u2019t want her mum coming with passive aggressive comments at him all night.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you propose you all had a joint christmas? With both set of parents and alle the kids. Esp. for this first christmas? But that wouldn\u2019t cater for mummy dearest, who you clearly have on a piedestal as most VIP in this divorce. \n\nCalling your ex mil is just insane. Be humble and tell them you messed up. YTA", "Yeah YTA.", "I really doubt you\u2019d let her have two of the kids for her Christmas if you were supposed to have them all this year. I get the feeling you\u2019d tell her to go screw herself. Also this is what happens when you\u2019re divorced. You have a court order for custody and you don\u2019t get to just make up your own rules. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. \n\nthe courts told you when you can see you kid and I can see why your wife divorced you. You sound like you\u2019re so far up mommy\u2019s ass you\u2019re still in the womb.", "**YTA!** Boy, are you ever the AH. Trying maybe a little too hard, are we?\n\nThe children will be with their mother, as has been finalized in the custody agreement, that she apparently needed to have drawn up in the first place, since you are clearly not able to negotiate anything without having a fit that would put your 2-year-old to shame.\n\nAnd then you have the audacity to call *her mother* to \"try to reason with her\"?! What the hell, man?! What kind of example are you setting for your children? \n\nBut then again.. judging from your mother's reaction, the apple didn't fall far from the tree.", "YTA and dumb. This isn't the compromise. The compromise is having 2 Christmas's so you get them either Christmas or boxing day to celebrate. You're not the first family do do this, did you not think to see what others do?\n\nAlso, I don't know why your relationship broke down but you needcto try a build a healthy co parenting relationship for you kids sake - this ain't it", "YTA, you big baby. Are you even capable of thinking of your kids instead of yourself? You are bitter and selfish, your ex is just playing by the rules. Grow up, man", "Just have your family Christmas on a different day. Jesus, YTA. I'm glad my divorced parents never fought over this dumb shit. It's just a day. It doesn't matter whether you have your celebration a bit before, a bit after, whatever.", "Holy shit, I had to reread the post a couple of times to make sure I was reading what I was reading. You're the MAJOR asshole here OP- you do not separate kids like that, especially over the Holidays!! Did you even consider what that would do to them and how that would make them feel?? Obviously not. Your wife may sound selfish and bitter to you, but that's all projection.", "YTA - You just now \u201cchecked the schedule\u201d and had a problem? Meaning there was an agreement already in place and you are already trying to amend it to suit yourself?", "The court actually does decide when you get to see your kids lol YTA", "YTA. You are the selfish and bitter one. You want your kids to spilt up for a holiday that they used to celebrate together, just so you could what? Get two out of four kids for your mother's happiness? Without thinking about your FOUR kids' happiness? Divorce is always hardest on the kids, especially your 8-and-6-year-olds since they have good (?) memories of holidays and family life. Instead of thinking about them and their happiness, you only care about yourself and your mother. \n\nPlus, they had also spent all their holidays with YOUR side of the family. For whatever reason you had the divorce, it is your ex's family(?) first time celebrating holidays together. The schedule is there for a reason, and it is agreed upon earlier, or decided by the courts. Who had the kids for Thanksgiving? Who is having the kids for New Year? What about Xmas next year? Are you going to continue separating the kids for holidays because it is \"unfair to me and my family\" if someone has all 4 kids?\n\nYou are truly TA here. To your kids.", "\u201cNo one can tell me when I get to see my kids\u201d - wrong, the court already told you! What, so you should have Christmas every year or the kids should be separated every year so your mommy doesn\u2019t get her feelings hurt? I\u2019m seeing why you\u2019re divorced. YTA", "Okay, OP. I've thought about this one and I have to agree, softly, that YTA. This is your new normal, unfortunately. Welcome to the life of a divorced father. Please don't prioritize your feelings over your kids, that's not right. More than likely you'll get all of them next year. \n\nNow, I'll feel different if your ex-wife winds up with the kids every christmas, but only time will tell.", "YTA. \n\nYour mother *CAN\u2019T* enjoy Christmas without her grandchildren? Gee, must make you feel great about yourself. \n\nLet me guess\u2026 you want the two boy children?\n\nI grew up with divorced parents. I know lots of other people with divorced parents. I\u2019ve never heard of splitting the kids up for the holidays. \n\nIt sounds like you are the bitter and selfish one.", "YTA. Others have already said most of it. You have a schedule. That\u2019s the way it goes. Next year you\u2019ll probably have them. Your ex is right; you are wrong.", "Yta. Unfortunately at that age most kids will choose their mothers so that will probably come first into play. Second no single court is going to grant separating the kids in any circumstance so good luck even if you go to court.", "YTA - This is the reality of divorce. You should put your kids not you or your parents feelings first. They are already going to have to adjust this year - separating them will make it much worse for them.", "YTA. You really should have thought this through back when you were negotiating the terms for the custody agreement. You don't get to punish the kids by separating them because you didn't.  What a lot of people do is,  one gets Christmas Eve, one gets Christmas day, switch the next year. At this point, however, you have a court order saying how it will go for this year.  Trying to alter that by force will not go well for you, and certainly won't impress the judge who will make the decision about future holidays.", "YTA. I love we didn\u2019t need any unnecessary backstory on why you\u2019re divorced\u2026.you and your family are assholes and your wife was done\u2026got it.\n\nUnfortunately if your mother at her age and stage of life doesn\u2019t recognize that the well being of the kids, especially during this first holiday season post divorce, comes first, then she never will, and I\u2019m very afraid you never will either\u2026.sigh", "It is figured out, you just don't like the results.\n\nThis year, she has custody of the children during Christmas. Next year, you should have custody during Christmas. Somehow, I don't think you would be willing to give up your children on your custody holiday. So shut up.\n\nAnd no, you don't separate children. Their relationship with each other is way more important over the course of their lives then supposedly grown adults who can't survive a holiday without them. Seriously, grow up.\n\nYTA", "Well I can see why you\u2019re divorced. I bet your wife had to put up with a lot of being deprioritised for the sake of your mother\u2019s selfish feelings (and a lot of Christmases not seeing her own family because your mother cried like a child).\n\nYour mothers WANTS do not take precedence over your child\u2019s needs and feelings.\n\nYour ex is probably and finally having the Christmas she\u2019s always wanted.\n\nAsk for New Years this year and Christmas next.

Your ex is completely correct. \n\nYou need to check yourself. When you are in a separated situation then you have to suck up the fact that sometimes you spend Christmas away from your kids. It comes part and parcel with the situation.", "let's see... which two are my/my mother's favorites.... no. YTA. follow the court order unless mutually agreed upon", "YTA. You don't care about what's best for the kids, you only care about what you perceive is \"fair\" to you.  A separation is already traumatic enough for kids, without you separating them at Christmas.\nI do think it may be best if you went a legal route, and had a third party negotiate between you and your ex if you can't do it amicably.", "YTA\n It is \"figured out\" by a judge presumably months ago. Get over yourself.", "YTA. Coming from someone who has divorced parents and has put up with all the drama surrounding holidays. It's best to just pick a different day to celebrate.

Successful co-parenting can only happen when you put the needs of the kids first, as well as show respect and understanding for the mother of your children and maintain a united front with her. \n\nTreating your ex poorly will absolutely be noticed by the kids and will lead to resentment. If you want there to be any flexibility in the arrangement going forward, you need to fix your behavior now. \n\nSuck it up and think about how every fit you throw or name you call your ex will impact your kids. Your #1 priority should be to make the holiday as enjoyable for them, not you or anyone else in your family.

Plan your celebrations on alternate days ie celebrate on 12/26. The kids will not remember which calendar day you celebrated, just that you did.\n\n3. Do not separate the kids. They will need each other to deal with all this and even small they will find comfort in being together \n\n4. Don\u2019t involve in-laws in disputes. They have no parental rights \n\n5. Do not fight in front of the kids OR complain about the custody agreement around them or even to your family with them in the house - they will hear it and be confused and then resentful", "YTA.

She said no and that I needed to prioritize the kids feelings above mine and my family's but I told her that this compromise is the best we could come up with. We got into an arguement and she insisted she won't let the kids be separated on christmas and that if I have an \"issue\" with that then I need to go to court. I snapped and in a moment of anger told her that no one can tell me when I get to see my kids, called her bitter and selfish then she hung up.\n\n\nI tried to call her mother hoping she'd reason with her but she instead shamed me for being \"willing\" to separate the kids from each others just so I could \"please my family\". and said that her daughter is doing whats best for the kids.

The adults need to sacrifice where they can to help the kids through this,", "Yeah, I always wondered who would be crazy enough to agree to King Solomon\u2019s \u201csplit the baby in half\u201d plan.\n\nNow I know.", "Am I showing my age if I substitute Hayley Mills?", "YTA.  Not just that, you are the AH that your ex was lucky to get away from if this is the kind of BS you pull.  Do you even realize that your children are people and not trading cards you can mix and match at your leisure?  As another poster stated they are also not support kids for your mother or you.  You are doing this in your best interest not theirs.  Celebrate on a different day, its not that hard, the kids will probably love 2 Christmases, what child doesn't love twice the presents!", "YUP. How about spring holidays ie Easter with the kids. Not as good as Christmas, but you can switch off next year.", "Not even just different days, growing up I\u2019d legit spend half day with my mom and the other half with my dad. That way I saw everyone on Christmas. And yes, We also do different days. But my parents were just divorced, not dysfunctional. \n\nOP - YTA", "Doesn't even have to be a different holiday, or different day. Growing up, we'd sometimes split it up between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, or even Christmas morning and Christmas dinner.", "IT\u2019s especially not the time to split up the kids when it\u2019s the first one after the divorce.  They have been through enough.  They need to get used to the new normal of not spending holidays with both parents.  Don\u2019t compound that by not even letting them stay together.", "Well I'm sure it made sense to OP since this post makes him seem like a Mommy's boy who'd jump the second she says to do so. Clearly he hasn't realised that most adults grow out of the \"you have to listen to mom because she's mom\" phase that he appears to be stuck in.\n\n(Also apparently hasn't realised that unlike his own mother, other people's mothers are under no obligation to take his side, especially against their own children)", ">I thought the same thing as I read this. He's like a big baby throwing a tantrum because ~~he's not getting his way~~ mommy's not getting her way\n\nFTFY", "When we had kids, both of our moms made a point to encourage us to put the kids first. They let us know they'd love to see us on Christmas, but didn't expect it. That they'd be happy to have us over on a different day to celebrate. There was no pressure. \n\nBut they're both healthy, semi-adjusted adults, who understand that their children are grown and have their own family unit to prioritize now.", "Going through a similar situation with my MIL at the moment and it really freaking sucks. Not divorced but totally understand a MIL with a me me me attitude.", "100%. Maybe for now Mom needs actual emotional support animals. She certainly needs therapy.", "Dollars to donuts he wants the older kids. I would bet $100 cash he doesn\u2019t change diapers or handle bathtime or put the kids to bed when they are little.", "Yes, that's such an important point! I have no idea how OP typed this out and thought that he would have people agree with him.", "Whichever two have kissed his mother\u2019s ass most recently go to his mother\u2019s house. (And they probably get more presents from grandma than the two lowly peasants that spend the day with mom.) Then the kids are going to have tension about \u201cchoosing sides\u201d between mom and dad, no matter what they choose. And now all holidays for the rest of their childhood aren\u2019t actually celebrations. They\u2019re passive aggressive fights where the kids cast their vote in favor of one parent and against the other. \n\nThus years and years of hurt feelings, parental alienation, and fractured sibling relationships begins! Father of the year award over here.", "Many parents who behave this way also have unhealthy enmeshment with the actual children as well. It\u2019s okay to miss your kids and grandkids. It isn\u2019t okay to let it control your mood, temperament, or ability to enjoy a holiday.", "The King Solomon story was the first thing I thought of too! If OP had only 3 children he'd be wanting to cut one in half.", "I wonder how she endured holidays before they were born. They must have been miserable /s", "Imagine being on the side of the baby chopper, and thinking it makes you *not* the asshole", "The MIL can be a problem - but we all know the husband taking Mama\u2019s side is the *real* problem!", "Right! This was the weirdest part of this! OP called his wife's mother, as if that meant something. I can 100% see why he is an ex!", "Same thought I had.\n\n\nOP you are most definitely TA, and frankly you (and your mother) sound insufferable and annoying.", "She probably has posts over on r/justnomil", "This is so what I was looking for. Selfish, catering to his mom at the detriment of others, flies off the handle, unwilling to take an answer. Good job to OPs ex.", "Could it possibly be because OP is bitter and selfish? That's what I'm thinking /s", "Came here to say this! \n\nYTA OP. Resorting to name calling when you (and Mommy) don't get your way? You sound like a controlling abuser.", "Yes. OP would probably benefit from some parenting classes and therapy, so he doesn\u2019t continue to make the same mistakes.", "Also\u2026.*which two kids would OP pick to bring?* No better way to drive a wedge between siblings than favoritism or the appearance of favoritism.\n\nSplitting the kids up like that \u2014where two \u201cget\u201d to see grandma and the other two don\u2019t \u2014 isn\u2019t healthy for the kids at all.\n\nYTA OP. Listen to what you\u2019re actually saying.", "He obviously didn't watch Parent Trap.  Kids don't like that.", "Nah. It\u2019s clearly the best version. My 13 year old prefers that one too.", "THIS 100% - the kids need to be happy together; their family unit has already been broken...", "Same here. I have to explain to my husband that his family does not have a monopoly on Christmas being a special day and wanting everyone to be together.", "Glad to know I wasn't the only one.", "Also, this will be the first time that they haven\u2019t spent Christmas with OPs side of the family by the sound of it, why would he expect his ex-MIL to say \u201cyeah, your mother has spent the last 8 Christmases with the children, of course she is entitled to this one too, you let her walk all over my daughter like you always have\u201d", "THIS. One set of kids will become the favorite and the other set not so much. NOT a recipe for a happy and cohesive family.", "That is exactly what I was thinking. What a horrible idea.", "Very much wonder this. There are two female/two male\n\nWill grandma pick a gender thing...or will Dad pick an age thing--the oldest two who might be less work for him(no diaper changes).\n\nDoes grandma already have favorites(or dad) and will those be picked. \n\nEven if none of the above are true, the kids will feel it.  A rejection for not being picked."]}
