My kids are 7 and 9 and hers are 6 and 12. This year we hosted Christmas dinner.\n\nI adore my sister and I adore my niece and nephew. They're good kids. We spend a lot of time together and our kids love playing together.\n\nHowever, her kids have this habit of digging into the food that's being served without it being in their plates. For example, once when we visited, my sister made mashed potatoes and both kids dipped their fingers in the pot and licked them, dipped again etc. My kids never did this in their life. \n\nI don't have a problem with that, her house, her rules. My wife and kids hate it tho.\n\nSo we were settling down at dinner, almost all guests had arrived. We had some light drinks and my wife and I brought out the first course which consisted of multiple things like cheese, grapes, ham, steamed veggies, meatballs etc on big platters so our guests can serve themselves with whatever they liked.\n\nAs per usual, kids start going around the table to pick stuff from the platters. We laughed and cheered as they played around until I noticed that my niece and nephew were grabbing something, taking a bite, and putting it back.\n\nMy wife noticed it so she went discreetly around to get the stuff they bit out off. I pulled my sister aside and told her to please tell her kids to stop doing that.\n\nIncome the next meal which was a light soup with sour cream. The instant my wife put the serving bowl down, my niece and nephew grabbed the ladle and licked it. We kinda laughed nervously, my wife replaced the bowl and soup. Again, I told my sister to speak to her kids about it.\n\nBefore the main course was served, my wife and I decided to just plate everything ourselves for each guest, which was a lot of work but worth it.\n\nAgain, niece and nephew immediately got up and started going around dipping their fingers in random plates. At this point my wife got a bit angry and told them aloud to wait patiently for their plates. Sister got irked. Guests started to get uncomfortable. Sis said \"they're just kids\" \n\nAfter an hour or so, we got out some chocolate cake. Niece and nephew literally put their hands in it before my wife got a chance to cut it. I saw her eyes started to get watery out of frustration and blew up, yelled at my sister for not disciplining her kids and making everyone uncomfortable.\n\nMy sister and BIL got up and left. Several guests said they found this gross but mom and dad say that I could've spoken to my sister in private.\n\nNow I feel like an AH.", "created_utc": 1671997378, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zv51pz/aita_for_blowing_up_in_my_brothers_face_over/", "score": 722, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People were shocked and surprised when he'd grab a pinch of rice off their plate, or chips from their basket.\n\nWhen he made it to our table and grabbed for our chips, I smacked away his hand (not hard, but enough to keep him from putting his fingers in our food) and told him in no uncertain terms to go sit down with his parents.  \n\nNaturally and instantly, his parents got all aggrieved about \"He's just *hungry*\" and \"He's just a little *boy*\" and \"How *dare* you\", shit like that.\n\nI told him to keep a leash on their kid and the boy could eat the chips and salsa at *their* own table, but he wasn't eating any of *mine*.  To their \\[minimal\\] credit, my apparently shocking outburst was enough for them to keep him at the table for the remainder of the meal (while shooting us dirty looks the whole time) but I'll never forget that kid's gasp of pure surprise when I smacked away his hand and hissed at him to go sit down.
