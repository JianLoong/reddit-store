My kids are 7 and 9 and hers are 6 and 12. This year we hosted Christmas dinner.\n\nI adore my sister and I adore my niece and nephew. They're good kids. We spend a lot of time together and our kids love playing together.\n\nHowever, her kids have this habit of digging into the food that's being served without it being in their plates. For example, once when we visited, my sister made mashed potatoes and both kids dipped their fingers in the pot and licked them, dipped again etc. My kids never did this in their life. \n\nI don't have a problem with that, her house, her rules. My wife and kids hate it tho.\n\nSo we were settling down at dinner, almost all guests had arrived. We had some light drinks and my wife and I brought out the first course which consisted of multiple things like cheese, grapes, ham, steamed veggies, meatballs etc on big platters so our guests can serve themselves with whatever they liked.\n\nAs per usual, kids start going around the table to pick stuff from the platters. We laughed and cheered as they played around until I noticed that my niece and nephew were grabbing something, taking a bite, and putting it back.\n\nMy wife noticed it so she went discreetly around to get the stuff they bit out off. I pulled my sister aside and told her to please tell her kids to stop doing that.\n\nIncome the next meal which was a light soup with sour cream. The instant my wife put the serving bowl down, my niece and nephew grabbed the ladle and licked it. We kinda laughed nervously, my wife replaced the bowl and soup. Again, I told my sister to speak to her kids about it.\n\nBefore the main course was served, my wife and I decided to just plate everything ourselves for each guest, which was a lot of work but worth it.\n\nAgain, niece and nephew immediately got up and started going around dipping their fingers in random plates. At this point my wife got a bit angry and told them aloud to wait patiently for their plates. Sister got irked. Guests started to get uncomfortable. Sis said \"they're just kids\" \n\nAfter an hour or so, we got out some chocolate cake. Niece and nephew literally put their hands in it before my wife got a chance to cut it. I saw her eyes started to get watery out of frustration and blew up, yelled at my sister for not disciplining her kids and making everyone uncomfortable.\n\nMy sister and BIL got up and left. Several guests said they found this gross but mom and dad say that I could've spoken to my sister in private.\n\nNow I feel like an AH.", "created_utc": 1671997378, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zv51pz/aita_for_blowing_up_in_my_brothers_face_over/", "score": 383, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are old enough to know better.", "I'd be speaking directly to the kids:  \"In this house we don't put our fingers into the serving bowl/touch other people's food, etc.\" and give consequences:  \"and if you cannot remember to do that, you will have to eat in the kitchen (or whatever)\".\n\nModel good parenting for those who can't seem to manage it.  \n\nNTA", "NTA.   That behaviour was making every other guest very uncomfortable. Your sister needed to deal with it. You discretely asked her to do so, repeatedly. She ignored you and upset your wife. There is a limit and she reached it.", "I once had a cousin who would do that and we all don\u2019t like it, but her mother thinks it cute. It\u2019s weird when people think it\u2019s perfectly fine to stick fingers into food that isn\u2019t even on their plates. NTA.", "NTA. You DID speak to your sister. You stopped short of parenting your sister's kids which you really should have done.\n\nBehaviour like that is why the pandemic lasted so damn long.", "NTA. That is really gross and a great way to spread germs.", "NTA I'm worried that if your sister doesn't get her kids under control then they do this with someone with less patience than you and yours and give them a whack with a spoon or something harsh like that", "NTA. Raised by wolves.", "NTA. Licking the ladle?! That would send me straight to Germaholics Anonymous.", "NTA. Eww", "INFO: are those kids mentally challenged?", "NTA\n\nCOVID and the flu are still a thing", "NTA. They need to fix this behavior. It is not cute. I wouldn\u2019t invite them for a meal again even if they are family.", "This is disgusting. Absolutely NTA", "NTA- I would have started to mimic gagging every time I saw them do it. You\u2019d hear me going \u201cBLECH!\u201d every 15 seconds. \n\nThis is absolutely reprehensible behavior and, at this point, the kids themselves need called out for it.", "NTA\n You DID speak to your sister and she ignored you. Those kids need to know this is gross, and when they start going to friends' houses or school events, that behavior won't be tolerated.", "NTA\n\nThat's rude and gross behaviour. Table manners are taught, clearly her kids have not been . In my family a ruler to the knuckles would have been the teacher.", "NTA. After the first time, I'd have grabbed a wooden spoon in the kitchen and warned her to tell her kids to keep their fingers out of the food.   \nFirst one to do it again gets their fingers smacked, no questions asked.", "NTA you did speak to her in private multiple times. I'd be absolutely furious if my nephew put his hands in food everyone was supposed to be eating and my sister didn't stop him.", "Wonder what would happen if you took something off one of the kids' plates, licked all over it, then put it back on their plate?", "NTA, your sister and her husband are disgusting for not teaching their children better manners. Sometimes a good public shaming is the only option!", "NTA, they should be old enough to have some manners and your sister is doing them a huge disservice by letting them carry on doing it.", "NTA \nMy sister doesn't care who's kids do what. In her house you listen to her rules. Could be William and Harry and she will still demand them to listen or leave.", "NTA. \n\nYou did speak to her privately. She chose to ignore you. \n\nYes, they\u2019re kids. But they\u2019re not little kids. They\u2019re way beyond old enough to know better. \n\nThey\u2019re being rude af and so is your sister by not raising them better.", "NTA and you did talk to your sister in private but she at best doesn't care, at worse gets off on your helplessness anything they touch inappropriately they should not be allowed to eat.", "NTa Especially when covid, flu, and rsv are out there. But even without that, it's disgusting and a 12 and 6 year old are old enough to know that.   \n\n\nYou acknowledged her house, her rules. She needs to do the same for you. And your parents need to recognize that you did multiple times tell them to do something about it and the behavior continued to escalate.  \n\n\nCan't wait for future AITA posts when these kids go off to college and can't understand why it's not ok to lick THE SOUP LADLE when they go to meet their bf/gfs family for the first time.", "NTA and that\u2019s absolutely disgusting. They can do that at their own house, but your sister is not teaching them to respect the rules at others. It\u2019s extremely rude to do, especially during this season when people get sick (and kids germs always seem to be extra strong). That would be the last time they\u2019d be invited until them can do better", "NTA\nDude I didn\u2019t do that shit past like 2", "NTA", "NTA- your sister and bil are disgusting and so are their kids. Maybe they shouldn\u2019t be invited until they can control their behavior.", "You tried to tell her, she didn't listen, she clearly heard you. So they took their disrespectful asses home.", "Nta at all firstly both kids should know better completely by now and you did speak to your sister multiple times and she did nothing so she had her chance", "NTA- They were warned previously. This is lazy parenting.\n\nHad they don\u2019t this in a restaurant they would have had to get rid of perfectly good food.", "NTA. This is disgusting. Period. Did you tell your mom you told her more than once and either way common fucken sense says not to do that. Kids my ass.", "NTA, this is disgusting, my 3 year old knows better, this is lousy parenting", "NTA.\n\nThey need to learn to behave or they'll end up like this guy I know who's in his 50s and still eats directly from serving dishes.  He will literally shove his hands into casserole dishes and stand there eating from the communal dish.  My first time attending a party there was also my last.", "NTA. You lasted a lot longer than I would have. The first time they did that would have been the last.", "Exactly!  Why is a 12-year-old doing it?  That's horrible", "Those kids are doing it on purpose. Touching every individually plated dish is not a lack of impulse control or manners. It is a deliberate act because they know it's gross and they want to make everyone feel gross.", "For real, is that not a thing anymore? When I was a kid, if you weren\u2019t following the house rules in someone else\u2019s home, you got corrected. And probably not asked back if you couldn\u2019t fall in line, but idk, I would have listened the first time.", "SMH. You damn right.", "Lol we found the sister", "I mean we have just spent years in and off in lockdown because\u2026\u2026", "I'd lay odds the 12 year old *doesn't* do that at school - unless they are the school bully and do it as a power flex on kids they want to dominate. It's disgusting.", "I think it's the thrill of doing something gross and watching adults have to deal with it without consequences. Like oooooooo look what we got away with.  \n\n\nIt's nasty and sister needed a serious wake up call.", "12 is wayyy too old for that shit. I would understand 2 and 4, but fucking *12 years old*? Gross.", "Family at that. My aunt and uncle would have had me seated in the next room before any food came out if I behaved like that. \n\nI absolutely would have removed the niece and nephew from the serving area.", "I\u2019d be way more uncomfortable with the nasty behavior of the kids.", "You have your answer OP, they wouldn't like it. That or they have so very little self-awareness."]}
