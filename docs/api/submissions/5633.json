My kids are 7 and 9 and hers are 6 and 12. This year we hosted Christmas dinner.\n\nI adore my sister and I adore my niece and nephew. They're good kids. We spend a lot of time together and our kids love playing together.\n\nHowever, her kids have this habit of digging into the food that's being served without it being in their plates. For example, once when we visited, my sister made mashed potatoes and both kids dipped their fingers in the pot and licked them, dipped again etc. My kids never did this in their life. \n\nI don't have a problem with that, her house, her rules. My wife and kids hate it tho.\n\nSo we were settling down at dinner, almost all guests had arrived. We had some light drinks and my wife and I brought out the first course which consisted of multiple things like cheese, grapes, ham, steamed veggies, meatballs etc on big platters so our guests can serve themselves with whatever they liked.\n\nAs per usual, kids start going around the table to pick stuff from the platters. We laughed and cheered as they played around until I noticed that my niece and nephew were grabbing something, taking a bite, and putting it back.\n\nMy wife noticed it so she went discreetly around to get the stuff they bit out off. I pulled my sister aside and told her to please tell her kids to stop doing that.\n\nIncome the next meal which was a light soup with sour cream. The instant my wife put the serving bowl down, my niece and nephew grabbed the ladle and licked it. We kinda laughed nervously, my wife replaced the bowl and soup. Again, I told my sister to speak to her kids about it.\n\nBefore the main course was served, my wife and I decided to just plate everything ourselves for each guest, which was a lot of work but worth it.\n\nAgain, niece and nephew immediately got up and started going around dipping their fingers in random plates. At this point my wife got a bit angry and told them aloud to wait patiently for their plates. Sister got irked. Guests started to get uncomfortable. Sis said \"they're just kids\" \n\nAfter an hour or so, we got out some chocolate cake. Niece and nephew literally put their hands in it before my wife got a chance to cut it. I saw her eyes started to get watery out of frustration and blew up, yelled at my sister for not disciplining her kids and making everyone uncomfortable.\n\nMy sister and BIL got up and left. Several guests said they found this gross but mom and dad say that I could've spoken to my sister in private.\n\nNow I feel like an AH.", "created_utc": 1671997378, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zv51pz/aita_for_blowing_up_in_my_brothers_face_over/", "score": 1109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I cannot believe she tried to dismiss their behavior as \u201cjust kids.\u201d They have no table manners and it\u2019s disgusting. Their parents are doing them a serious disservice. They need to nip this in the bud now!!", "I mean that\u2019s plain gross. No offense, I wouldn\u2019t be eating your wife\u2019s food after that so she has every right. Hopefully you back her", "NTA You did ask your sister three times and she ignored you.", "You did speak to her in private...twice! Your parents are either completely clueless or are determined to ignore the outrageousness of their behavior. The youngest is 6 years old, not 6 months, which means they're old enough to know how to behave themselves. No, this was not a case of \"kids being kids\" it was a case of brats being enabled by their entitled parents. NTA!", "NTA. You DID speak to your sister in private. Multiple times. Your parents need a reality check: your sister's kids are gross.\n\nETA: Were I one of your guests, I'd apologise to you and depart, as I generally prefer to choose which other humans' germs I ingest.", "NTA \n\u201cMom and dad said that I could\u2019ve spoken to my sister in private\u201d \n\nUmmm ya did more than once and nothing changed\u2026. That\u2019s really gross and unhygienic.", "NTA\n\nIn fact, in my opinion I don't think you did enough. Your house your rules. The first time they showed bad manners you should have said something directly to them like \"in my house we use proper manners and keep our hands and fingers out of food that is not on our own plate\". The second offense would have been me grabbing them by the wrist, dragging them from the room while telling their mother to follow now. Sister and kids would have then been told to leave since they are obviously feral and not fit for company. But yeah, I am a judgemental witch who has no problems telling other people's kids how they are to behave in my home and I will point blank tell their parents that we always defer to the stricter rules whether it's a parents rules or the rules 9f the house we are visiting.", "NTA; those kids must have really struggled with quarantine and lock down\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude15", "NTA.\n\nYou did talk to her in private. MULTIPLE TIMES.\n\nIf anything after the first time you should have ignored her and started talking to the kids. \"oh sorry sweetie, in our house we don't (do obviously disgusting and unsanitary things that your parents should have been teaching you) stick our fingers in food not on our own plates.\"\n\nIt's your house you rules. 'they're just kids' is utter horseshit. Being just kids means that they're not *judged* for such behavior, not that you don't correct it!\n\nFurthermore this isn't pinkies up when drinking tea nonsense etiquette, it's sanitary food handling practices during a pandemic. Fuckin gross dude.", "\u201cWhen the sister said \u201cthey are just kids,\u201d she is trying to justify the fact that she is not even trying to make them better kids so in the future they can be descents adults", "NTA. That's just straight up NASTY, and your sister enables it, which makes HER TA. By 6 & 12 they should know and do better.", "NTA my 3 year old even knows that he should not do that....", "Ewwwww. NTA. If someone did that at my dinner I'd seriously consider grabbing the nearest steak knife. Don't host your sister's family again until they have learned table manners.", "NTA your sister knows. She raised kids with atrocious manners. Pandemic teach her nothing?", "NTA you did speak with your sister in private more than once.  It is gross behaviour", "NTA. Both kids are old.enough to know better.", "Lick a ladle at my parents or grandparents table and it'd be rapped across your knuckles. Wouldn't do it a second time!", "NTA. You did speak to your sister in private. It didn't work, so finally your wife blew up and I don't blame her. You need to tell your sister if her kids aren't taught basic manners they won't be invited to dinners until they are. Tell her the guests were grossed out by how her kids acted, and your kids don't act like that. Ask her if she sees that, and to take care of it.", "NTA- you did talk to your sister about it, twice. That is a gross and very rude habit and they need to stop. They essentially ruined your entire dinner and your sister disrespected you by not stopping them when asked to repeatedly.", "phrase i hate like crazy\u2026 they\u2019re just kids.  so kids can\u2019t have manners ?  nta", "\u201cThey\u2019re just kids\u201d yea, kids have the nastiest, dirtiest fingers of anyone lol", "NTA and tell your sis her kids are not welcome until they can display enough manners to not make other guests sick. Because that is what is going to happen if they continue.", "NTA. These parents are doing a disservice to their kids by letting them behave like animals. Ill-mannered animals at that. I would also never go to their house for a meal. God knows what happens to the food.", ">I pulled my sister aside and told her to please tell her kids to stop doing that.\n\n>but mom and dad say that I could've spoken to my sister in private.\n\nAre your parents blind? You literally told her to make her kids stop, she didn't listen and got you and your wife upset. You're definitely NTA, but your sister is a huge AH", "Somebody needed to make those kids a plate.", "It's weird though that OP wouldn't say anything directly to the children. With stuff like that, I tell visiting children \"our house rule is that...[whatever I want them to stop doing].\" You don't have to be mean, just inform them of something they don't know.", "My niece and nephew (5 and 4) even waited for me to grab them some gummy bears out of my kids\u2019 bag for them today", "My three year old knows better than this. It\u2019s absolutely disgusting.", "Agreed. NTA.", "Forget the kids, my dog knows better than that.", "Wow ! They would NEVER set foot in my house again. Love my family, but HELL NO !And of course they are old enough to know better. Soooo NTA .", "Especially kids fingers, kids are dirty.", "By 6 years old and 12 years old, they are definitely 100% old enough to learn basic table manners. \n\nTheir parents should've discipline them as soon as OP pulled his sister aside, but they didn't. It's on the parents. In fact, the parents had multiple chances to tell them to stop.", "This is one of the dumbest replies I've seen in a long time. Congrats...", "You do know that one of them is TWELVE, right?", "How? He spoke to the sister twice and she did nothing. You can only take disrespect in your own home for so long.", "The parents allow such behavior and as such the kids are going to take advantage of that. Their parents are probably the kind that excuses their behavior bc \u201cthey\u2019re just children \u201c. Don\u2019t discipline but talk to them instead.", "That was my reaction.  They are doing it so fast that it's not a random impulse.  And licking the ladle is not normal even for very young children who don't know better.\n\nThe kids are definitely doing it to get a reaction.", "I developed a policy very early in my parenting journey that if the parents weren't there, or didn't act, and it was affecting my kids, I was definitely going to step up and say something or stop the behaviour.\n\nI gave the parents the chance first, but if they didn't do it or weren't there ...", "And these aren\u2019t little kids. One is six and the other if 12.", "Especially considering how old they are. 6 is bad enough, but I\u2019m supposed to believe a 12-year-old doesn\u2019t know better? Absolutely not.", "\"I have asked you thrice\"", "Just weeks ago I saw my former coworker stick her bare hand into a bin of chocolate covered raisins at a grocery store and she licked her hand after she pulled it out. I was NOT with her, I just encountered her at the store. She's so gross. And yes I alerted the staff as to what she did.", "The 12 year old must know better. If they tried something like that at school or with their own friends they would be punished socially, no one would talk to them, other kids (and adults) would absolutely give them shit and no one would be kind about it.", "The number of times I've seen people **pull down their masks to sneeze**. It is mind-blowing. And not to mention the number of people that did it inside a doctor's surgery.", "Especially considering other countries have rising cases again..", "Yeah, by 4 (most) kids are in preschool and learning about boundaries and keeping their hands to themselves. These kids are being disrespectful on purpose.", "\"she got spooned\"\n\nunexepected r/thetick", "I had a customer pull down their mask to lick their fingers to help count the cash they were about to hand me. \ud83d\ude43 Working customer service during Covid destroyed so much of my not high faith in humanity.", "I'm sorry, what? I hate to have to ask this but how do you do wipe using the bowl?", "I also sneeze into my masks, but in my defense, I trained myself to hold in the snot years before the pandemic because I absolutely hate unexpectedly having boogers hanging out of my nose.  Only if I\u2019m actually sick with a runny nose am I unable to contain it.\n\n(No I can\u2019t explain how I trained myself to sneeze without snot, nor can my dad explain how he trained himself out of getting migraines.  My husband would really like that insider secret, but it was long before we were born so it\u2019s been lost to time.)", "I don't think I've ever sneezed with snot? I'll have a bit of saliva spray occasionally, which is still a pretty bad feeling in a mask, but I thought the snot part was just in cartoons.\n\nAlso, masks are difficult to keep in stock sometimes. I use one per day, some of my coworkers go through 5-10.", "That\u2019s why I bought myself plenty of cloth reusable masks from Etsy, I even get compliments on them from my customers!", "Aw, I love those but we can't use them. I work for a dentist and assist procedures. I can understand changing them after eating or getting someone's fluids on them, but some people just take them off, put them down somewhere, and grab a new one when the come into the room. It's so wasteful."]}
