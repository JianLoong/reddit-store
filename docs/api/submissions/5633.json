My kids are 7 and 9 and hers are 6 and 12. This year we hosted Christmas dinner.\n\nI adore my sister and I adore my niece and nephew. They're good kids. We spend a lot of time together and our kids love playing together.\n\nHowever, her kids have this habit of digging into the food that's being served without it being in their plates. For example, once when we visited, my sister made mashed potatoes and both kids dipped their fingers in the pot and licked them, dipped again etc. My kids never did this in their life. \n\nI don't have a problem with that, her house, her rules. My wife and kids hate it tho.\n\nSo we were settling down at dinner, almost all guests had arrived. We had some light drinks and my wife and I brought out the first course which consisted of multiple things like cheese, grapes, ham, steamed veggies, meatballs etc on big platters so our guests can serve themselves with whatever they liked.\n\nAs per usual, kids start going around the table to pick stuff from the platters. We laughed and cheered as they played around until I noticed that my niece and nephew were grabbing something, taking a bite, and putting it back.\n\nMy wife noticed it so she went discreetly around to get the stuff they bit out off. I pulled my sister aside and told her to please tell her kids to stop doing that.\n\nIncome the next meal which was a light soup with sour cream. The instant my wife put the serving bowl down, my niece and nephew grabbed the ladle and licked it. We kinda laughed nervously, my wife replaced the bowl and soup. Again, I told my sister to speak to her kids about it.\n\nBefore the main course was served, my wife and I decided to just plate everything ourselves for each guest, which was a lot of work but worth it.\n\nAgain, niece and nephew immediately got up and started going around dipping their fingers in random plates. At this point my wife got a bit angry and told them aloud to wait patiently for their plates. Sister got irked. Guests started to get uncomfortable. Sis said \"they're just kids\" \n\nAfter an hour or so, we got out some chocolate cake. Niece and nephew literally put their hands in it before my wife got a chance to cut it. I saw her eyes started to get watery out of frustration and blew up, yelled at my sister for not disciplining her kids and making everyone uncomfortable.\n\nMy sister and BIL got up and left. Several guests said they found this gross but mom and dad say that I could've spoken to my sister in private.\n\nNow I feel like an AH.", "created_utc": 1671997378, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zv51pz/aita_for_blowing_up_in_my_brothers_face_over/", "score": 2395, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Didn't work.\n\nJesus Christ this is gross. Taking a bite and putting it back? I'd have told them off myself way earlier than your wife did.\n\nA 12 year old should ESPECIALLY know better.

Neither does my 11 year old brother.\n\nIt's not an age thing, it's a shitty parenting thing.\n\nNTA", "NTA that\u2019s f-ing gross and your sister and BIL are SO inconsiderate!!", "NTA. Some people (this time, your parents) are so uncomfortable with confrontation of any kind that they\u2019ll bend over backwards to try and pin the blame on the confronter (is that a word?) instead of examining the underlying cause for the outburst. Put it back on them- what do they think you should have done differently to get the behavior to stop? \u201cI did speak to her privately, twice. When that didn\u2019t work, I personally told the children to stop licking food that other people were expected to eat and that my wife and I worked reallynhard to cook for everyone. And it STILL a continued to happen. So, in all your wisdom, what should I have done? How long do they get keep falling back on the \u201djust kids\u201d excuse, when my own children are sitting across the table from them and clearly NOT behaving this way? Would you like me to come to your house and spit in your stew?\u201d", "> Again, niece and nephew immediately got up and started going around dipping their fingers in random plates.\n\nYeah, no.  This is the point where we go from clueless to malicious.  Walking around and putting their fingers on other peoples' plates?  Do that to mine, you're getting stabbed with my fork.", "NTA. That's some real Neanderthal behavior and maybe that's how BIL's family does things and your sister just goes along with it. It's clearly quite disgusting behavior and they should be deeply ashamed.", "NTA. First off, that's disgusting regardless of whether you are in your own home or a guest. There's still a pandemic on top of that. You tried to be chill about getting them to stop. Anyhow, your sibling's kids are feral and it's your sibling's fault.", "Nts\n\nBut now I feel incredibly angry and nauseous. That is truly horrible. There is zero chance it would have happened a third time if it were my house. Just no!", "You talked to her privately, multiple times. She did nothing. Next time they're over put everything the kids touched or licked on your sisters plate. Don't let her have any of the fresh food since she doesn't think licked food is disgusting she can have that. Maybe then she'll realize that mashed potatoes with saliva and smashed cake are not supposed to be served to others. NTA", "What? My 4 year old niece stuck her finger in the butter at Xmas and I told her to stop sticking her finger in the butter, cut off the part she touched, and we all moved on with our lives. \n\nWhy does this go on and on with out anyone just reacting in the moment with the kids?? Isn\u2019t that what family is?? It didn\u2019t need to get to the explosion point. \n\nBut NTA bc it is so gross and antisocial to repeatedly stick your fingers into communal food. Those kids are waaaay to old to even have be told this.", "My kids are 7 and 12. Yesterday at Christmas dinner they warned me in private that that  grandma had coughed on the salad and the Mac and cheese and so I shouldn\u2019t get more of those. There is no reason OP\u2019s niblings aren\u2019t old enough to know they can\u2019t stick their hands in the communal food.", "My 2 year old knows better. This is purely bad parenting", "I think the only way those parents will try to change anything, is if the other family members stop inviting them and stating clearly the exact reason.", "\u201cKnock three times on the ceiling\u201d", "Yes, mother needs it too! My doggos respect the squirt. I hold it up and they stop whatever they were doing.", "Oh my god, just buttering the rim...oh my god.", "I know, right? Ewwww!"]}
