I didn't want to cause drama, so I went about it as non-confrontational as possible. I agree now I should've been more direct. Another concern a lot of you had was, that I allowed this to happen to my daughter previously. That is not true. This is the first time he promised her one of his trips. That's why I decided to say something, so this doesn't become a recurring thing. \n\nHere's the update. I tried to call my uncle twice but he didn't answer. I got through to my aunt and explained everything to her; how many times he did this to my siblings and I and how often we were disappointed. I told her my daughter was so excited and that if they were actually planning to take her on this trip, I would apologize. She didn't take that well. She told me I was creating unnecessary drama and that my daughter and I are acting \"entitled\" to expect them to drop everything to go on this trip. I was shocked and angry. I said how dare you say that. She didn't imagine this trip in her mind and then expect you to take her, you PROMISED her this trip. Her disappointment is not entitlement. I said it's not my job to make sure a grown man feels secure in himself and it's a shame my family spent so long coddling him. I was so mad I just hung up. \n\nI don't feel any ounce of guilt for setting my boundary anymore.\n\nFor everyone asking if I can take my daughter on the trip, unfortunately that theme park closes for the season this month. But I surprised her with something even better. After the phone call with my aunt, my partner and I decided to book a trip to Disneyland! It sounds crazy and impulsive, but we've been wanting to plan this for a while now and decided it's the perfect time. My kid IS entitled to an extravagant trip. Last night, we sat her down and explained that her uncle won't be able to take her on the trip. I tried to be as honest as possible without confusing her. She was unsurprisingly upset and had a lot of questions. After we answered them all, I told her not to worry because her mom and dad are taking her somewhere instead. When she found out it was Disney, she was over the moon. She's spent all day deciding which Minnie Mouse stuffy she wants to take with her. I told her to tell her class her trip got upgraded. \n\nAll things considered, it's a happy ending. I know I won't always be able to protect her from disappointment, But I sure as hell will do my best. She's getting that giant hotel room she was promised.", "created_utc": 1698344640, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17h2yym/update_aita_for_telling_my_uncle_to_stop_gifting/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Your aunt is a piece of work.  \"We promised your daughter a trip but you are entitled because you expect us to follow through on that trip.\"\n\nHave fun at Disney!", "That family dynamic is just wild. Why has everyone just accepted that uncle *exclusively* gifts crushed dreams and disappointment to all the kids in the family. How and why did it take so long for someone to push back?", "Unreliable people are the worst when it comes to little kids. I have family members that we stopped telling them they were coming over because most of the time they wouldn't show up or cancel last minute. It is such a disappointment to young children. The scale of this makes it so much worse.", "Good job Momma!", "#[Please Find Original Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17f46fq/aita_for_telling_my_uncle_to_stop_gifting_my/)", "Youre the best! \n\nI am sorry your uncle is immature and has been coddled for so long. What he did to you and your siblings was in fact cruel and not some innocent gesture that should be brushed off because of ... quite frankly poor planning. Birthdays aren't surprises and for little little kids toys or hell some BUBBLES and a cupcake mean the world to them .\n\nHe did in fact want to be seen as a big shot, by children, which is weird and he has issues.", "No kidding, the belief that you can play with a child's emotions to stoke your own ego.", "Thank you"]}
