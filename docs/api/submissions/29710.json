I didn't want to cause drama, so I went about it as non-confrontational as possible. I agree now I should've been more direct. Another concern a lot of you had was, that I allowed this to happen to my daughter previously. That is not true. This is the first time he promised her one of his trips. That's why I decided to say something, so this doesn't become a recurring thing. \n\nHere's the update. I tried to call my uncle twice but he didn't answer. I got through to my aunt and explained everything to her; how many times he did this to my siblings and I and how often we were disappointed. I told her my daughter was so excited and that if they were actually planning to take her on this trip, I would apologize. She didn't take that well. She told me I was creating unnecessary drama and that my daughter and I are acting \"entitled\" to expect them to drop everything to go on this trip. I was shocked and angry. I said how dare you say that. She didn't imagine this trip in her mind and then expect you to take her, you PROMISED her this trip. Her disappointment is not entitlement. I said it's not my job to make sure a grown man feels secure in himself and it's a shame my family spent so long coddling him. I was so mad I just hung up. \n\nI don't feel any ounce of guilt for setting my boundary anymore.\n\nFor everyone asking if I can take my daughter on the trip, unfortunately that theme park closes for the season this month. But I surprised her with something even better. After the phone call with my aunt, my partner and I decided to book a trip to Disneyland! It sounds crazy and impulsive, but we've been wanting to plan this for a while now and decided it's the perfect time. My kid IS entitled to an extravagant trip. Last night, we sat her down and explained that her uncle won't be able to take her on the trip. I tried to be as honest as possible without confusing her. She was unsurprisingly upset and had a lot of questions. After we answered them all, I told her not to worry because her mom and dad are taking her somewhere instead. When she found out it was Disney, she was over the moon. She's spent all day deciding which Minnie Mouse stuffy she wants to take with her. I told her to tell her class her trip got upgraded. \n\nAll things considered, it's a happy ending. I know I won't always be able to protect her from disappointment, But I sure as hell will do my best. She's getting that giant hotel room she was promised.", "created_utc": 1698344640, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17h2yym/update_aita_for_telling_my_uncle_to_stop_gifting/", "score": 3528, "replies": ["Your aunt is a piece of work.  \"We promised your daughter a trip but you are entitled because you expect us to follow through on that trip.\"\n\nHave fun at Disney!", "That family dynamic is just wild.

Of course, I was optimistic despite the fact that these things never happened. \n\nSome of my friends decided that a great gift for me would be a car accessory, like a suction cup doll or fuzzy dice for the rear view mirror.

This is the first time he promised her one of his trips.\n\nIt was the first time it happened to your kid but it happened to you and others in the family.  It still isn't clear why you allowed your uncle to have access to your kid when this is his pattern.", "Good. And don't ever let him lie about gifting her a trip again.\n\nMy god, what a bizarre situation.", "I'm happy that you got to gift your daughter something and follow through, your uncle is awful.\nWhen I was young, my dad would go on business trips and I always wanted to go on an airplane. He said, by the time your 13, you'll have been on a plane! So my mind thinks an extravagant vacation.\nNearing my 13th birthday, I'm still unsure if it will happen. And it did happen. In a super unexpected way! He got his pilot friend to take us up in his 4 seater plane. It wasn't what i expected, but it was one of the coolest experiences of my life. I hope your Disney trip is as awesome as my airplane ride!", "\u201cI said how dare you say that. She didn't imagine this trip in her mind and then expect you to take her, you PROMISED her this trip. Her disappointment is not entitlement. I said it's not my job to make sure a grown man feels secure in himself and it's a shame my family spent so long coddling him.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m so proud of you.", "Am happy that you decided to confront your aunt about it, and were even able to upgrade the planned trip to going to disneyland with your family instead. I hope all of you have a great time there, and that she also has a lot of fun.", "You need to tell your uncle (and your aunt) that you won\u2019t be letting the tradition of dashed promises continue with your daughter, and that any birthday cards (or other holiday cards and gifts) will be opened by you first to protect your child.  And enjoy Disney!", "I thought you might find this post interesting as it too dealt with someone who was making false promises to the poster's daughter\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15j2jfh/aita\\_for\\_telling\\_my\\_sister\\_i\\_need\\_to\\_see\\_proof\\_of/", "wonderful update. uncle and aunt are, as expect, the AH", "your uncle and aunt deserve each other...\n\nbut im so glad you and your wife can make this happen for your little one! have lots of fun", "Glad you worked it out for your daughter. Hopefully you will be going NC with aunt and uncle. Entitled? For expecting them to keep a promise they willingly made? That's some bullshit.", "After how your aunt reacted, you absolutely have to go no contact with both of them. That's the only way to protect your daughter.", "Promise them an anniversary trip, don't actually plan anything, when the day comes when they ask where the tickets are, then say you sound like an entitled hag.", "My mother did this shit all the time. I hated it. Anytime I brought up things promised to me, I was suddenly an ingrate that deserved nothing. \n\nSo frustrating.", "I guess I'm just concerned that these lies and manipulation are going further than promises of extravagant trips. Like this cannot be exclusively his thing, right? There has to be something else going on... drugs, alcohol, sexual perversion, mental health, or something else. And like someone else mentioned- the pathological lying must extend to other areas as well. This is just too bizarre to be lying exclusively about extravagant trips to his female family members. Something else is going on here.", "Yeah, my in-laws have a family friend who is a retired elementary school teacher, and she sends our kids birthday cards that contain all kinds of stickers, pictures saved from old magazines and calendars, just a packet of random stationery that she saved over her years of teaching. It is a HIGHLIGHT of their bdays and they\u2019ve barely ever seen this woman in person, but they know her by name and send thank you cards to her (and then get thank you cards back for their thank you cards). My oldest is 9 and still loves this stuff. They really don\u2019t need huge gifts or trips!", "I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you.", "The author is Jenny Lawson, AKA \"The Bloggess,\" and she is absolutely hilarious, even when telling sad stories like that. I listened to that book some years ago while driving cross country, and at one point I was laughing so hard I thought I would have to pull over on the shoulder to avoid crashing into another car.", "Why don't people read things", "> Here\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand.\n\nseems like there's a lot you don't understand...", "Did you make it past the title?", "So you have met my ex MIL? It was a running joke that every gift giving occasion, the gift from her was still \"on order.\" Oddly, the orders never arrived. We stopped getting her gifts, telling her \"oh we ordered you something, it should arrive any day!\" In fact, my ex still tells her that. Makes the holidays a bit cheaper.", "It\u2019s incredibly sad for people expected to work around these various issues and not make a scene.", "> just going to lunch or a picnic, something SMALL that could EASILY be done.\n\n\nyep, 5y/o's are super easy to amuse. would have been so easy to take them to a petting zoo and they would have a blast", "Love ur name", "My grandparents were the \"make a promise because it is expected\" type rather than because it made them feel great, and then over time, just let it fade away. \"Oh, we'll get lunch next week!\"  Lunch was never gotten. But it made them feel like they were fulfilling their social and moral obligations by saying they were going to do something with their \"estranged\" grandkids even if they never followed through.", "Anything educational in my city is free! The zoo, museums, the science center. My parents were so worried about an expensive trip when they came to visit me since we had so much planned. They ended up super under budget. My siblings went to school with some really cool stories, my parents wallet was happy. Other than gas to visit, parking was the most expensive thing.", "Yea. Kids remember EVERYTHING!!", "Yeah, time doesn't heal that wound. I'm still hurt that my father promised to take us to see The Three Lives of Thomasina and never did. My dad never \"promised\" anything, so when he \"promised\" to take us I believed him. But he procrastinated so long, the movie left theaters. This was in 1964 and it still bothers me; it felt like such a betrayal.", "It reminds me of something I tell every time I am asked if I am a Raiders fan having grown up in the East Bay and being a fan of the other East Bay teams. The answer is no, they betrayed me by moving to LA when I was a kid and they will never be forgiven."]}
