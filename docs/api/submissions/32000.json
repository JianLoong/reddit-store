We have a small kitchen with one table, a bench next to a wall and three chairs, one of them right in front of the door to my room, which is right behind the kitchen. The room\u2019s only entrance is the door in the kitchen too. \n\nIn the last week, one of my roommates (m27) suddenly decided to always take his laptop and sit down on the chair in the kitchen right in front of my door. He has a working computer and a table in his room which he always used before. But now, he sits in front of my door for sometimes the entire day. When I leave my room in the morning, I most often almost immediately trip over him, because he sits right there. I have to almost climb over him to get to my room or leave it. When I go to bed, he\u2019s there. When I have friends or my boyfriend over, he\u2019s there. When I talk to people on the phone, he\u2019s there. \n\nMy issues is, I feel like I have no privacy at all anymore. I had very little before but now it\u2019s worse. You can hear every little footstep where he sits, every little thing I do, everything that me or my friends say through the damn door, no matter whether it\u2019s in the room or on the phone. And he just has no apparent reason to sit there either, because his computer works just fine and he has a table in his room and there are other places around the kitchen table that are NOT basically in my room. I asked him whether he can sit somewhere else, but he said this is the kitchen and he has a right to sit there.\n\nI\u2019m very mad about this but I\u2019m thinking that maybe I\u2019m mad because I have a lot of other, smaller issues with him too. My roommates want us all to do a lot together anyway, so I really want to have my alone time when I need it. But now I\u2019m wondering if he\u2019s right and whether I do not have the right to ask him to move.

Can you get a white noise machine and leave it just outside your door. This is what a lot of therapists do so people in the waiting room can\u2019t hear what\u2019s going on inside the therapy room. If he complains tell him you can do what you want in the kitchen and call a group meeting because he\u2019s definitely trying to listen.", "NTA\n\nI am guessing he is doing it because he wants to annoy you, either because he likes you or is a jerk.\n\nI get why he might not what to be in his room, but there is no reason he can't sit somewhere else in the kitchen after you politely requested him to move.", "Put some headphones on and start playing music or a noise machine really loud.", "Start playing music loudly in your room, or better, not music but some podcast or streaming if you are watching these things. Not loud enough to be completely heard in the kitchen but louad enough that people hear stuff happening. It will be annoying and distracting and he might move out. He has a right to sit in the kitchen, you have a right to listen stuff in your room.\n\nAlso, next time trip over him when you get out of your room. Physically blocking your exit when he has alternative is not ok.\n\nNTA.", "I have no idea why he's chosen to sit and work in the kitchen rather than in his room. This might well not be malicious - he might want company, and to have human interaction with people who come in and out of the kitchen. He might want a change of scenery to get over some mental block. It's not like he moved the chair to sit right outside your door - he's sitting at the kitchen table on one of the chairs. That's a normal place for people to sit. Why is he sitting by your door? I assume the different chairs in the kitchen point in different directions. Some of them are probably better than others from the point of view of daylight from the window, or something like that. \n\nThe problem, in my mind, is that he's spending all day, every day, sitting in your small kitchen. That's an unreasonable use of the shared space. Houseshare kitchens are typically not large enough for all the housemates to just permanently hang out in them. And if someone sitting in this particular chair blocks your access to your room, then it shouldn't be a general use kitchen chair (or perhaps it should be the one that you sit at when you eat together).\n\nSo you get NTA for this. He's only a mild AH, but he is being a bit of one.", "NTA, but I'm not sure you can expect him to move.  What you can do is make it hard for him to sit there.  Papers knocked on the floor?  Computer pushed in one direction or the other?  Anything spilled on anything?  Well, he knows you need to get into your room...", "NTA he\u2019s an aggressive jerk but this is what you get with this type of living situation. This is going to be a war of wills and I suggest you get a different living arrangement. What would happen if you would leave your door open and blast music at the doorway at him for example. And why aren\u2019t your other roommates defending you", "NTA take his spot first.", "He has a reason; to eavesdrop \ud83e\udee3\ud83e\udd2f", "NTA. I would start spilling shit on him and his computer. Oops sorry didn\u2019t see you there, is your laptop ok? Oops sorry I spilled some coffee on your head, didn\u2019t see you there. Just keep hitting him with a door and spilling shit making it super uncomfortable for him, he will magically find his room to be much more comfortable ASAP. Also I would put a lock on your door because he is giving off creepy vibes.", "When you leave your room spill something on him. Half mug of cold tea, last night's water etc. Do it every day til he gets the hint or his laptop gets damaged. Feign ignorance and a bad memory about him sitting at your door. If he can't remember you made it clear you were uncomfortable, you can't be expected to remember his laptop does not get on well with liquids. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA\nI think possibly tomorrow morning, you might trip and spill a full glass of water all over him and his laptop and apologise for him choosing such a silly spot to sit in when he knows how difficult it is for you to get out. Will be an awful pity if he doesn't have insurance on his laptop or have everything backed up.  So sad.", "Nta, if he doesn't want to swap rooms or go be in his, just start bringing your friends and bf over and talk shit about him loud enough he can hear it.", "NTA but its time to get inconsiderate about that doorway. Blast music through it, make tons of trips and \"accidentally\" knock him with as many items as possible, invite friends over and invite them to go in and out, demand every single time that he get up and get out of the way and when he complains say \"I'm not paying to have to climb over an obstacle every time I enter or leave my private room. If you want that seat, you have a responsibility to not inconvenience the person you're blocking.\"", "ESH, Everyone Sucks Here.\n\nHe's inconsiderate for choosing the chair when there are other options around the kitchen table. But plenty of people choose not to make their bedroom their workspace, for productivity/sleep reasons.\n\nBeing annoyed about him blocking the door is reasonable.  Being annoyed about privacy or kitchen noise is not---this is a crappy apartment layout and presumably you were aware of that when you took the room.", "NTA and i\u2019d say you should have some friends over and talk crap about him in your room (not maliciously trying to hurt him but to show him that he shouldn\u2019t sit where he can hear your private conversations) that way he learns if he doesn\u2019t wanna hear him being insulted then he shouldn\u2019t sit right in front of your door", "NTA", "NAH\n\nThe kitchen is a common room. He has every right to use it.  \n\nCould he be more courteous and sit elsewhere?  Sure.\n\nBut he is under no obligation to do so.", "YTA. You can certainly ask him not to sit there but if it\u2019s a shared space then that\u2019s just as much his area as it is yours. And no he\u2019s not \u201ccreepy\u201d, I haven\u2019t heard anything you explained that would give red flags. Maybe he just likes that spot? Maybe to AC/heating vent is right there? Maybe the natural sunlight is nice? Whatever the reason he\u2019s allowed to sit there and you can\u2019t demand that he move. Close your door and play music if he\u2019s being too loud. Or find a new apartment with a bigger/better layout where your door is not right off of the kitchen.", "YTA you live in a small apartment with 3 other people, so you can't expect that much privacy.
