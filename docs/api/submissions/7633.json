I wasn\u2019t the kind of baby where it was unexpected but a pleasant surprise that made older parents happy. It was the surprise they didn\u2019t want and they just kept me but it\u2019s been clear my whole life I\u2019m not wanted. My older sister Kara is my full sister and she is 50. It\u2019s pretty damn clear my parents were done being parents in their late 30s and planned on enjoying life once my sister was around 18-20. I was basically cared for by my sister. My parents interacted with me so little that they actually forgot I existed sometimes. My sister stayed home whilst studying to basically be my mom and when she got her own place, she took me with her. My parents didn\u2019t notice I was gone for 3 months. Even then, it was like they didn\u2019t care. Throughout the years I\u2019ve heard them talk about only having one daughter and laughing when they\u2019ve been corrected about having two, citing \u2018oh guess we forgot about that one.\u2019 \n\nI barely interact with them. They\u2019ve forgotten my birthday a lot, forgot the date of my graduation and have even called me the wrong name before. They\u2019ve met my fianc\u00e9 numerous times and have forgotten his name and who he is to me which really really hurt. My sister hates what my parents have done and she too is minimal contact with them but it still hurts that they care for her more. My sister has tried her best and I don\u2019t blame her for anything. Kara was there for my high school graduation, my university graduation and for every single birthday and Christmas. She did everything to just be there for me.\n\nAnyway I\u2019m getting married next month to my long term boyfriend Alan! I am so excited and naturally, I asked my sister to walk me down the aisle as she is practically my mom. I sent our invitations months ago, including to my parents just to have them there I guess. I didn\u2019t expect anything but to my surprise they accepted. They were just invited as guests, nothing more and nothing less.\n\nMy upcoming nuptials has piqued my parents interest despite it being literally weeks away. I have told them nothing and only now has my dad inquired about walking me down the aisle. He said he wants to start \u2018building bridges\u2019 with me and wants to walk his \u2018little girl\u2019 down the aisle. He told me this to my face after I agreed to meet him and I laughed in his face. I told him he and my mom are just ordinary guests and nothing more and that he is barely a father to me and I\u2019m not his little girl. I ended it by saying that i wouldn\u2019t care if they came to the wedding or if they didn\u2019t and that I only invited them as a courtesy.\n\nWell, he is \u2018deeply hurt and offended\u2019 that I said what I said and that I don\u2019t see him as a parent. My mom said that they\u2019re sorry for everything but want to make it right but this has literally been spurred on by the fact I\u2019m getting married. Kara has blown up at them saying they are lousy parents and that they weren\u2019t owed invites. I have some family members saying maybe I should give them a chance instead of being an AH yet they never once helped my sister out either. I\u2019m very stressed about this and the wedding and am wondering if maybe I\u2019m the AH after all.\n\nETA: I have accepted my situation but at the same time, a part of me still craves that love and affection you get from having parents \ud83d\ude14. I invited my parents just to be nice and as a courtesy despite everything.

Repeat to yourself 10 times a day: it's THEIR loss. NTA, and I hope you have a great life.", "I'm really sorry but if they've been selfish AHs for 70 years, they are not going to change now. They may pretend for appearances, but they're not capable.\n\nAnd don't forget they didn't love Kara enough to not make her your parent. They didn't love EITHER of you.", "My therapist says we\u2019re biologically hardwired to love our parents.  I know it\u2019s something that probably developed through evolution to improve survival rates or something, but holy shit is it unfair.", "And he's taking the absolute piss by pretending you actually have a father daughter relationship/wanting to take the spotlight on your day. Nah you're not the AH here, he's delusional", "Honestly nothing out of the ordinary. He was super polite that day and looked the part of \u201cFather of the year\u201d. But he\u2019s just distant overall and I wish I honored someone else who has a more active role in my life.", "To answer your question l, I would have answered explosively. Probably laughed then cried. This may have felt like a moment where I could actually impact my father\u2019s emotional life and be heard. I probably would have laid out examples of how badly he had failed me. Plenty of people are going to give you ESH and YTA votes, but I don\u2019t believe that they would all \u201ctake the high road\u201d or prioritize an absent parent\u2019s feelings over their own about their wedding day. \n\nI agree that it may have felt cruel to your father, but not that it was unnecessary. Sure, you COULD have chosen to be conciliatory or docile or to demur but why would you? Weddings are not the place for family reconciliation time. Not when It\u2019s \u201coh but you must invite your estranged cousin,\u201d not when it\u2019s \u201cbut you must let your mom make a speech and perform a song,\u201d and certainly not when it\u2019s \u201cyou have to let your estranged father walk you down the aisle.\u201d\n\nYou hold a lot of anger and resentment towards your parents. This is valid, but likely very intense to live with; I hope you have a therapist who is helping you manage those feelings. Expressing your feelings is a fine and valid thing to do. I don\u2019t believe for a moment that your father asked you this question when he did because he regrets his actions or because he believes it to be the right way to mend fences with you. Every person at that wedding will wonder - or already know - why he\u2019s not walking you down the aisle and he wishes to avoid that perception.\n\nFeel free to ask your mom exactly what she plans to do to \u201cmake it right\u201d and why your dad walking you down the aisle and usurping the role of someone important to both of you, who did the work of raising you, would help literally even a little at all.", "I\u2019ve seen you say you invited them as a courtesy to be nice, then when asked that basically went straight for the jugular. Think if being nice was the original intention behind the invite keep that consistent and just say you already asked your sister and feel more comfortable with her doing it, or just don\u2019t invite them at all.", "Still have them a attend but introduced them by their first names and don\u2019t mention parentage. How many threads have we seen where it\u2019s been confirmed being a sperm or egg donor doesn\u2019t make you a parent.", "Oh I\u2019m really sorry to hear that", "OP ignore this bullshit please.\n\nYour father was trying to emotionally manipulate you and your reaction was completely reasonable and human.\n\nIT'S YOUR DAY. The very fact you offered them a seat at your wedding should have been enough, but instead he tried to make it about him and grab more.\n\nShame on him. Good luck to you on your wedding <3"]}
