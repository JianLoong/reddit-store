You and child\u2019s father need to have a discussion about what is appropriate for your daughter. You\u2019re not taking away bonding time from his mother, she could just as easily spend time with her not talking about religion.", "NTA\n\nIf you're not comfortable with it and it's your child it shouldn't be happening. At the very least you and the child's father should be able to come to some sort of agreement together about religion.\n\nReligion is a huge thing for anyone and I personally feel the same. Only adults that can handle such concepts should make decisions about lifelong beliefs. I had religion thrown at me like that. Every little mistake I made I thought I was going to burn for eternity, that I was disposable and unworthy of love from someone who loves all... and no child should feel like that.", "NTA --- Religion should be banned from children till they are old enough to decide for themselves if they want to be indoctrinated and brainwashed to believe that there is a magical sky daddy watching every little thing they do.", "NTA Info: What's the father think?  Have you two spoken about religion and how you both want to raise your child?", "What has your ex said about raising your daughter to be religious? What your exMiL wants doesn\u2019t matter here.\n\nYour daughter isn\u2019t too young to hear stories. She\u2019s also not too young to understand that people are different.\n\nYou can tell her that some people, like her grandmother, believe that Jesus walked on water and was the Messiah. You can tell her others believed Jesus was just a man, or that he never existed at all. You can tell her what you believe, or even what your household believes, and then explain that there are different faiths and everyone believes differently. \n\nHowever, to have that conversation you need to know what you want to teach her when it comes to faith. You also need to be on the same page as your ex.\n\nHow you talk to her about faith doesn\u2019t need to be complex. It\u2019s more than possible for a three year old to grasp basic concepts. It\u2019s also okay if she has questions or doesn\u2019t have a clear understanding of things. \n\nWhat does matter is having those conversations, with your ex and then with your daughter, because whether you think she\u2019s ready or not she\u2019s having those conversations with other people.\n\nYou can either help shape her worldview when it comes to faith or allow it to be shaped by others. Telling her to not listen to people is very different from telling her what she should be listening to. It\u2019s also very different from teaching how to listen to someone and how to process what she hears.\n\nBecause it sounds like you haven\u2019t put much thought in how you were going to navigate religion I\u2019m going with ESH. Your exMiL is overstepping but your ex is allowing that to happen and you haven\u2019t put boundaries or expectations in place to stop it.\n\nStart figuring out how to talk to your child about things you\u2019re not ready to talk about. Children don\u2019t turn a magical age that allows them to comprehend and process messages. They learn little by little in age appropriate ways.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nI personally have always been of the opinion that religion needs to be a choice that is freely made, when people are old enough to make an informed decision. \n\nA three year old isn't even legally considered self aware. Which in my opinion makes her way too young to be able to make that kind of decision. At that age it's indoctrination. Not choice.", "NTA \nNot sure if there is much you can do to curb grandma\u2019s behavior but you can have age-appropriate conversations with your child when this comes up including making sure that you are conveying your own beliefs and values without denigrating grandma or dad. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that grandma tells you bible stories. Do you like the stories? Grandma believes these stories really happened, other people believe they are just stories. Most people can decide this when they are grownups. I learned these stories when I was little too. I think some of them are good and true stories and some are made up to help us learn things.\u201d\n\nI would have a separate conversation with your ex regarding the whole dedication thing and make sure that no one is doing this (or baptism, etc.) without your consent. I would also be careful about anyone scaring your child - someone telling her she will go to hell etc. and put my foot down on that for sure. \n\nI personally do see this as brainwashing but using that language about your exes mother is not constructive.\n\nEdit: PS - remember that as the primary custodial parent you have the most influence on your child and remain calm and set a good, rational example. Role model critical thinking and kindness and your child will learn and eventually develop their own beliefs primarily from your influence.", "NTA. You need to do some research into your ex\u2019s religion- denominations of Christianity vary VASTLY in how they teach and do things, and you need to be informed. Some do baptism at birth. Some do something at birth and around age 11-14. Some wait until people are adults. Some have strict expectations of gender roles, views on LGBTQ+, political views, service expectations including monetary donation, behavior restrictions, pledges they ask teens to make- you need to know what you\u2019re getting into. Some are lovely community organizations that would be a great place for your daughter to make friends and learn about acts of services, and some will tell her she\u2019s a sinner because she\u2019s a woman. Do your research now because they will not wait for your daughter to be old enough to do it for herself. You have to talk to her father now about what you want her taught and involved in. It sounds like your have very different ideas of what her religious upbringing will be like.", "NTA\n\nShe is absolutely brainwashing her, and in the words she'd probably understand, she's grooming her to become a religious nut and someone's subservient wife. \n\nYou need to talk to ex, and create strong boundaries when it comes to crazy religion his mother is trying to push on your daughter.", "Nta and this is indoctrination", "Grandma is \"pushing her down trying to push the holy spirit into\" your 3 year old daughter.. \n\nI'd be getting a court order that Grandma either couldn't talk religion with my kid, or my kid couldn't see Grandma. NTA.", "NTA. They are definitely brainwashing your kid. Get her out of there. Some Christian cults can be really sick and do horrors to kids, both physically and mentally.\n\nYou're not TA for wanting to 1, protect your kid, and 2, give her the ability to *choose* her own religious path, if any.\n\nTbh you should tell your ex and ex MIL that you won't let your kid go to church or stuff like that until she is way older.\n\nIn the meantime, you could balance this by trying to teach her stuff about acceptance and consent and tell her that there are more religions in the world and all should be respected.\nThere are ways to explain this stuff to kids in simple ways that they understand. \n\nThis should be able to counter the possibly extremist views she'll get from her dad and grandma.\n\nEdit: to say not all churches are bad. But also kids should be able to choose if they wanna go or not. For some people, going doesn't make much of a difference later on. But for others, it can really F them up. Depends on a lot of this, sure. But it's always best to let the kid decide", "NTA. Sit down with the father and MIL and discuss what you\u2019re comfortable and not comfortable with. This would piss me off endlessly", "NTA.  I think indoctrinating children with religion is child abuse.", "NTA.\n\n> She wants me to stand in front of the whole church and have me tell them I am dedicating my daughters whole life to the church and to Jesus.\n\nIMO, forcing religion onto kids is abuse. I personally think religion is nonsense, but if adults choose to believe in it and support it, that's their right. They have the agency and control to choose what they want to believe.\n\nChildren, especially young children, don't have that ability. In many case they're forced to believe whatever their parents and other authority figures choose to ram down their throats. A three-year-old can't exactly pick up the car keys and drive away if they don't agree with what they're hearing. For that matter, they likely don't even have the ability to really understand what they're hearing.\n\nAlso, from one of your comments:\n\n> I've tried but they've always chalked it up to I am a non believer and I shouldn't have a say.\n\nI'm sorry, but they can go fuck themselves. Believers aren't somehow better than non-believers. Your opinion is not irrelevant because you don't agree with them. You are your daughter's mother. While you and her father have equal say in what goes on, the grandmother has NO say whatsoever. She had her say with your ex. She doesn't get to also control what happens with your daughter.\n\nI would be very cautious about dealing with anyone who wants to dismiss your input on raising YOUR child because you don't happen to share their belief system. Be very careful and don't be afraid to get the courts involved if you think it necessary.", "INFO: I mean are you sure you don't have issues with religion because if these are the only two real things she's said this isn't much different than random stuff 3 year olds from just watching TV. Idk I've heard 3 year olds say random stuff like this all the time, unless there's more evidence I wouldn't jump to assuming your husband's parents are thumping her over the head with Bible lessons or nothing.

I went to church as a kid and I initially believed that I could walk on water. Of course, I grew up and learned and made my own path.\n\nYou claim you want your kid to make her own choice when she gets older, but it doesn't mean you don't allow her to go to a place of worship. As for \"dedication to the church\", I think that can be held off, until Confirmation or something.\n\nBased on your post and title, you view kids learning about religion as a negative thing by automatically associating it with \"brainwashing\".\n\nEDIT: Based on the OP's sentence \"grandma was talking in a crazy way and said she was throwing the holy spirit on me and pushed me down mommy\", this church seems fishy. I would talk to your ex about the \\*type\\* of church the grandmother is taking your kid to. I know churches vary a lot, so I feel like your kid needs to go to a much healthier church (ex. pro-LGBT).\r  \n\r  \nI still don't like your association with brainwashing and religion because now tons of people here act like kids can't experience religion.

You as the mother indoctrinate the child into whatever philosophy or moral system (formalized or no) you feel like from birth.

As a parent, he has a right to do this. If they believe their religion is the truth, why wouldn't they work to raise your child in it? The instances you pointed out seem age appropriate explanations your child has been given. Doctrinal beliefs are told in a simple way to young children and are expanded upon as they grow up and children can understand more complex concepts.\n\nYour MIL was being inappropriate in asking you dedicate your daughter to the church since you aren't a member of that church. This is something your ex should have discussed with you and you shouldn't be expected to participate in it.\n\nIf you are upset that your husband's family is influencing your daughter with their religious beliefs, you should never have gotten together with a man who, along with his family, has such differing views from you. This is why people should figure out if they are compatible on major life issues before they have sex and especially before they have children together.  Shame on you for not working out how you would handle religious issues in your child's upbringing with him before this came up.", "Soft YTA.  I completely understand your issues with religion and totally get why you'd want to wait until your child is old enough to decide for themselves but your opinions don't negate your ex's right to raise his child in the religious setting of his choice.

This is also done in things such as infant baptisms. If the child decides they don't want to be a member of that faith in the future then they leave.

I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy of pretending like it's about her age vs the fact that she just doesn't want her to be religious. Now, the fact that you think you would have failed as a parent if your 11 yo becomes religious is concerning and your reasoning is quite frankly stupid. Do you believe in the Big Bang theory? A catholic priest formulated that. Charles Darwin was a firm believer in the Abrahamic God. Galileo was a devout Catholic and was supported by Pope Urban and the Jesuits up until a certain point, contrary to all the stories that paint the situation worse, and even then that split was about politics and the church feeling its role as top dawg being threatened, not religion. Kepler, Schrodinger, Planck, Copernicus, and many others whose scientific research is still used today were all self-professed believers. If you truly believe none of them were critical thinkers and you are somrhow more intelligent, well that just proves my point now doesnt it.

But if OP were in Iran, their post would look very different. \n\nRegardless of which country we're discussing where family could force Christianity onto a child: Muslims are not committing genocide in those places. Jews are not committing genocide in those places. Hindus are not committing genocide in those places. Buddhists are not committing genocide in those places. \n\nThese are minority religions that behave in their communities in a way that reflects the cultural power that they do not have. They cannot behave in a way that is dangerous to the community in the same fashion as Christians do, out of fear of great violence from Christians. There is no risk to the child to learn about any other religions. \n\nAdditionally, genocide is literally designed into Christianity in a way that absolutely is not present in other religions. Christians give it a friendly name: witnessing. Or missionary work. It's a basic feature of the religion that the destruction of other cultures is considered a virtue. \n\nThis is why it was common to remove native children from their families and force them to learn Christianity, up until very recently. Genocide is one of Christianity's key tenets; it's intentional, not an accident. \n\nWe're also living in a time where Christians are engaging in a concerted effort to target LGBT people, people of color, and Jews, in increasingly hostile and violent ways. This behavior has grown in popularity and power once more. Christianity is a real, active, and acute threat to many people's safety. \n\nThis threat is not present, to **any** extent, in other places of worship in countries where Christianity is the dominant cultural force. The child won't be harmed by being exposed to other religions, but she will be harmed by this kind of indoctrination into Christianity. And likely groomed into a mindset that will cause her to harm others. \n\nBut you already knew that. Because the dishonest argument you've posed isn't a new tactic. It's meant to deflect relevant, contemporary criticism off the religion, as a means of avoiding reflection on the way your religion treats its neighbors in the world. In the countries where OP could be from, Christianity is uniquely violent, hateful, and harmful. Seeing other religions will help inoculate her child from that.", "No, YOU are 100% wrong. 54% of children raised without religion become religous as adults. 46% of adults do not practice the religion they did as a child, whether from converting to another or becoming an atheist. These numbers are easily located on line, along with numbers that state there are only roughly 5 religions on the planet that have a 2/3rds rate of retention of adult believers, whereas almost every other religion fails to keep even half of its faithful after a certain age."]}
