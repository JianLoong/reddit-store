I was actively instructed to use the elf as a method of controlling the students, which dear lord I didn't do, but the teachers sure did. If any kid acted up in any way, the whole class (or in the 3rd grade class, about half of the students) would freak out and start yelling how they have to stop or else the elf/snowman is going to get them all in trouble. I was encouraged to move the elf around at lunchtime to help keep up the charade. It created a sense of paranoia in the class, especially the kindergarten one as you can imagine. It's a very effective method of getting young kids to behave, but if used nefariously, it can cause a lot of trauma.
