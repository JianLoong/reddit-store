I was actively instructed to use the elf as a method of controlling the students, which dear lord I didn't do, but the teachers sure did. If any kid acted up in any way, the whole class (or in the 3rd grade class, about half of the students) would freak out and start yelling how they have to stop or else the elf/snowman is going to get them all in trouble.

Her older brother was saying he wasn't \"See? The encyclopedia (HAH, again showing my age) defines Santa a mythical old man. MYTHICAL! That means fake!\" he told her.

Valentines day cards go back multiple generations.  Elf on a Shelf dates to 2005.  \n\nIt's just NOT a \"venerable tradition\" and it's nowhere NEAR as universally known as holiday \"secrets\" (or pretend things) like Santa or the Easter Bunny.  I'm sure that the Elf is more ubiquitous in some areas than others, making it more regional, perhaps.  But it doesn't have the huge reach of the Santa tradition, and you definitely should not expect that there is any kind of broad social agreement on what you do or say about it.\n\nI realize that I'm kind of drawing an arbitrary line, there.  I'm fine with new traditions developing.  But -- while acknowledging that some folks may do Elf on a Shelf in a very benign and fun way, I keep hearing stories where it causes real anxiety in kids, and is presented as very controlling, and I do NOT like that.  So I'm definitely biased against this \"new tradition\", in particular.\n\n(Like... yeah, the whole idea that Santa has a naughty and nice list for \"all kids\" so you have to be good, etc., that's been around for a very long time.  And over time, there have certainly been kids more anxious about that than others.  But it's one thing when it's a sort of \"invisible threat\" -- Santa \"knows\", but apart from visiting Santa at the mall or whatever, Santa is not THERE in the house WATCHING YOU all the time.  It's a \\*concept\\* for kids to think about, but it's not looming over them, necessarily. No more than their parents' presence and judgement have always been there. Adding this idea of a specific \"spy for Santa\" that is judging you, yes you specifically, in your house, watching you directly all the time... UGH.)\n\nAnyway.  With Santa, and to a lesser extent the Easter Bunny, I think most teachers or adults in that position working with kids would know to \\*at least\\* tell a kid \"hey, try not to spoil it for the other kids, okay?\"  Because, as I said, Santa traditions go back generations and adults in Christian-dominated countries know how it works. There \\*is\\* a broader social agreement about it.  \n\nI can't blame an adult for not taking Elf on a Shelf as seriously, as a \"secret to be kept from kids\".  Most adults likely didn't grow up with it at all, and it is nowhere near as universal a part of the holiday as Santa is.  (Again: maybe regional, who knows.)\n\nI know I can't take anyone seriously who is putting it on that same level.", "No they should say Ask you parents.", "They're basically teaching kids to live in a surveillance state. https://www.etsy.com/listing/1118260832/elf-report-elf-naughty-warning-letter", "Omg what even.

It doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re a bad boy etc. Just ease their worries. \n\nI\u2019m a parent whose had people break the Santa news to my son too soon (I didn\u2019t karen on them, just asked the other kids not to say it again and play along). I also want my kid now to not tell others, he was told it\u2019s a sort of secret society to cheer others up. You have to be creative and childlike but think ahead and set some safeguards lol\n\nTo make it easy, I suggest use the same rule, **calm the kid while you deflect on to the parents**, when asked any awkward belief questioning things. You\u2019ll get all sorts of questions, religion, gender, sexuality, polyamory etc. It gets easier. Also, I can still share my beliefs without being specific (maybe useful if you ever need to), I tell my kid/his friends everyone is different, offer different perspectives or ideas (where appropriate), or simply to be respectful of all beliefs/lifestyles, not impose views etc. for example, but won\u2019t say what is real, \u2018right\u2019 etc. on any specific issue and leave that to them/parents.", "So... she doesn't do elf on the shelf... but was mad that you told her son it wasn't real?
