Can someone explain this for me?", "NTA.\n\nThis elf on the shelf crap is just terrifying.\n\nIt's not bad enough that some judgey old dude with weigh problems is randomly watching them with a crystal ball or something, now they've got one of his minions stalking them openly in their home.", "YTA simply for not redirecting him to talk to his parents. You\u2019re his tutor and that\u2019s it. Whether he\u2019s old enough to know the truth or not is irrelevant. It wasn\u2019t your place to say anything more.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great question. Different cultures and families celebrate Christmas differently and believe in different things. For my family/culture we don\u2019t have Santa and his elves, so I don\u2019t know how it all works. Why don\u2019t you ask your parents? I\u2019m sure they can explain it to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe that means you\u2019re a really good kid and Santa doesn\u2019t need to send an elf to check on you. Ask your parents. They might know the answer.\u201d\n\nYou could\u2019ve said anything to redirect it. Then have a conversation with the parents about it so they\u2019re aware of the situation and can address it. You\u2019re reputation around the school amongst parents is now going to be that person that caused elf-gate.", "Elf on the shelf is terrible, it teaches moral surveillance and it encourages a belief in the unreal in children old enough to know better.", "They sell accessories - clothes and kits for activity\u2019s. I saw them last time I was in line at the grocery store in the impulse section which was at child eye height. \n\nMost kids that age have access to the internet. \n\nSeems odd that \u201cyou buy it at the store\u201d is the proof needed to debunk any kid that\u2019s still believing for whatever reason at that age.", "Exactly. It's so 'new' a tradition that you'd have to be quite arrogant to believe everyone will keep the lie up. I had no idea until I read this post that it's a thing some kids believe with as much belief as they do Santa Claus. I could easily have given the game away myself to somebody, because I simply didn't know it was a thing that you have to pretend is real.", "My parents were both upset about Santa and had, before they even met each other, decided they wouldn't do that to their own kids. I loved all my Christmases as a child (still do as an adult). \n\nYou know who didn't love all of theirs? \n\nEvery cousin of mine on the first Christmas they had after finding out Santa wasn't real.\n\nHeck, the country that goes the hardest when it comes to Christmas (the Philippines) doesn't tend to teach their kids about Santa as being real. Santa is everywhere but seen more as a symbol of Christmas generosity - more like a commemoration of the actual St Nick. It doesn't stop the kids loving the Christmas season,", "I am the master at \"playing along.\" I was the oldest grandkid so I knew when I saw them setting up a playground one Christmas Eve when I was like 8.\n\nI've played along so well that at 41 with my own kid, Santa still visits me. It's pretty sweet. \n\nYou guys shoulda played the long game, lol.", "My grandmother put Santa on one of my presents when i was 21. Yeah, i just looked at her funny", "Yeah, it just weird.", "I can\u2019t believe it took so long to see a comment like this.  Not everyone is Christian.", "This is so different than asking about babies. Every person with a uterus that produces a child has it in that meat sack.\n\nElf on a shelf however is cultural, what if he asked his parents and they also didn't know (not being from the country, not having that tradition...etc I didn't learn about it until it was made fun of in the show the League, and I am a white American)\n\nWhat if they googled it and told him it was from the store? Or if they did know and didn't celebrate it they explained it the same way the teacher did. He STILL likely would have told friends it wasn't real. It's what kids do.\n\nTo pin this on the teacher is dumb, maybe if it were a well known thing like Santa she would have said ask your parents. But elf on a shelf? That mom who was mad should have been upset a kid blurted the truth and also have been ready for it. Kids who are 8+ tend to be told by parents about truths in some families, and it's bound to be spilled by some kid who thinks all his friends already knew.", "So if the parents teach their kid to eat Elmer's glue, you shouldn't tell them that's not such a hot idea?\n\nOr how about those genius parents who think it's funny to teach their kids the wrong names for colors?", "Why not just answer these questions?", "Oh you and I live in very different worlds then.\n\nNo idea what an Italian town has to do with this.", "Lol, it was a joking reference to The Godfather, Don Corleone and anyone else from his Family, who would give a different answer to a child asking about the role of the police.\n\nGreat book, great movie.\n\n[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the\\_godfather](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_godfather)"]}
