Her mom, her best friend from childhood (41m) and his boyfriend were also in attendance. This was in a restaurant (no mess, no stress, just pay and eat). An older lady (probably late 60's) was standing near our table waiting for her family to catch up. She was a standard-issue older lady... except she had (intentionally) dyed blue hair. Well, my girlfriend said WAY too loudly \"omG! LoOk At ThaT 80 yEaR oLd WomANs Blue hAir!! HAHA\" Her best friend chimed in with the same critique. They kept saying things like \"Why do old woman do that, are they trying to be young?\" and impersonating her: \"this will make my granddaughter think I'm COOL\" and laughing and so on.\n\nTHE WOMAN COULD HEAR EVERY WORD. The first mention of the word blue hair and I saw her eyes dart straight towards us. The best friend said to my gf : \"It's you when you're in your 80's, HAHAHA\" and my gf said \"OH GOD, no, hahahaha\"... after a minute or two, she had enough and walked outside to wait for her party, looking VERY sad in my opinion.\n\nWhen we got back home, after a few hours, my girlfriend said \"Jeez, how about that woman with the blue hair, RIGHT?\"\n\nWell, told her how I thought they were being mean. How that woman heard EVERYTHING and how her actions may have impacted this poor woman. (Now... there is absolutely a chance the woman didn't give a shit and thought \"fuck you\". We'll never know.)\n\nMy girlfriend and her best friend were viciously bullied as kids. My girlfriend is an amazing, sweet, caring and thoughtful person. She never intended for that woman to hear. But her and her best friend have been \"people-watching\" like this since they were kids. When I let her know that es, that woman ABSOLUTELY was listening and seemed quite hurt, my girlfriend just BROKE DOWN. BAWLING crying, snot bubbles, shaking and all. She said she felt so bad and knew what it was like to be bullied. She immediately owned up and said she just wished she could apologize. I felt terrible now OF COURSE, and backpedaled and just focused on this being a \"teachable moment\" and that nobody is perfect and she's still of course a good, sweet person. Just a tipsy error in judgement. But she was locked in on guilt. She had to take a sedative to stop crying and sleep. I held her for hours while she cried and mumbled \"^(I'm so sorry...)\" It really brought her back to being bullied as a kid, and how she felt when It happened. But those bullies said it LOUD, directly, peppered with \"loser\", \"freak\", etc, we all know how bullies do. My girlfriend is not a bully. She just never thought about the consequences of shit talking before. She IS a good person. So is her best friend.\n\nAnyways reddit... AITA??? IT WAS HER FUCKING BIRTHDAY AND SHE CRIED HERSELF TO SLEEP.

As an adult, the absolute LAST thing I would ever want to do is make someone else feel bad, or make fun of anyone for any reason (with the *possible* exception of people being super mean or rude.) I go out of my way to smile at and compliment strangers, just to spread a little joy in the universe. Anyone who would make those kinds of comments about a stranger, whether they could hear it or not, is an enormous AH, in my opinion. \n\nYou, OP, are NTA, and I don\u2019t really think she feels as bad as she\u2019s leading you to believe.", "I\u2019m sorry, *what*?

You are over here thinking how awful you were and it was your GF\u2019s *birthday* and you *ruined* it for her and wishing you hadn\u2019t said anything and next time you just won\u2019t say anything about her \u201cpeople watching\u201d. \n\nYeaaa. Manipulated. NTA", "NTA And your girlfriend is a bully and her and her best friend have been bullies for a long time. Seriously, she\u2019s 41 and is still acting like this? \ud83e\udd22Their \u201cpeople watching\u201d (yeah most people I know who do that aren\u2019t mercilessly mocking and belittling people) probably started when they were getting bullied really bad and this was their way of getting even or just coping. Or they were thinking, \u201cit\u2019s not the same thing since we aren\u2019t going to the person and saying these things. So it\u2019s ok and it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d It\u2019s an unhealthy coping mechanism and clearly they have gotten bolder over the years, again YEARS OF THIS CRUEL BEHAVIOR, since they definitely knew she could hear and went harder at this older woman. Your girlfriend needed that metaphorical slap across the face because she has become what she despises and fears the most. And she probably knew it too, she just couldn\u2019t face it. So you made her and she can\u2019t cope. Don\u2019t back down on this, though be gentle about it. Maybe she is a good person but she needs to work on herself a lot, if she isn\u2019t in therapy suggest it. She could really benefit from it and I\u2019m sure it would help your relationship too. I don\u2019t know if you guys live together or how you see your future but think about this. If you want to spend the rest of you your life with this woman, and she doesn\u2019t change. Can you put up with this? What if she turned this behavior onto your family or friends? What if, after this incident, and she\u2019s done feeling sorry for herself, the bullying gets worse, more bold since it\u2019s out in the open now. Can you stay with a woman that can be so undeniably cruel to people for her own enjoyment? Good luck to you and your girlfriend, I hope she can change for the better.", "What exactly do you think bullies are? Bullies are those who prey on those who they perceive as weaker (the elderly) or different (those with blue hair). I had a friend who was horribly bullied as a child, she wrote books about bullying.

She is a bully, who KNOWS what she\u2019s doing, when she does it. Oh, and she doesn\u2019t give a damn. She\u2019s now trying to \u201cfix\u201d what you saw her do, by playing the sad, pitiful, unaware, remorseful act.  When you see how nasty people treat others to their face - believe it.", "Next time, call out your girlfriend RIGHT THERE when she's acting like that. Don't stand by while anyone is rude and bullies another person. *Your girlfriend didn't care if the woman could hear her.* Your gf showed you who she is. Is that all of who she is? No. But that mean streak is part of her, and you need to call it for what it is. If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem. \n\nEdit: last sentence.", "Top tip: your gf is not a good and sweet person. She is a nasty bully and so is her friend. NTA.

You rightfully pointed out how she was cruel about the older woman and had hurt her, she turned it around and made herself the victim. What a great performance, all those tears and regret. Now you feel you did something wrong and it's not about her behaviour any more. You feel bad because she CRIED that she never meant to be mean when she was saying dreadful, mean things to that woman. Your girlfriend is the only victim in her mind and you better be sorry you made her cry.", "NTA, and I get the feeling that any time you try to bring up any issues with her behaviour etc, she cries until you back pedal then too.", "NTA.

And a great actress. \n\nI people watch all the time. It\u2019s not really a vocal exercise, you\u2019re just watching life en situ. There\u2019s no need for commentary.", "NTA. What she was crying about was experiencing cognitive dissonance. She sees herself as a victim of bullying, not a bully. Unfortunately, as a grown woman, she CHOSE to bully another person, despite knowing how awful such behaviour from others feels. The pain she is feeling is from the difference between her perception of herself and the reality. At least the people who bullied her at school had time to grow up to be better people as their brain matured. Her brain matured from the experience of bullying into wanting the power to belittle others.\n\nAs a side note, she ruined her birthday through her own actions, not you. Also, is there any reason why you didn\u2019t stop them whilst they were bullying the woman?", "OP you got manipulated!! \n\nNTA - you did nothing wrong. your gf was being absolutely horrible and mean and needed to hear what you said. She made herself the victim to you so you would backpedal instead of being truly remorseful for being a bully.", "NTA She didn't care about the woman's feelings until she was called out on it.  If you  noticed that the woman heard her , there's no reason she didn't especially when her entire focus was on the woman at the time. Her image is the reason she's upset  not the woman's  feelings.

She is not good and sweet, she's a bully. Only bullies talk that way about other people, especially when they are in earshot!

My abusive narcissistic BPD ex wife started out like this, diving straight into tears when called out on her abuse, she was so sorry, so so sorry, she'd go and see someone, she had a problem, etc etc, and then after a week or so she would be back to being an abusive asshole, no help had been sought, and the cycle would begin again.

Her mom, her best friend from childhood (41m) and his boyfriend were also in attendance. This was in a restaurant (no mess, no stress, just pay and eat). An older lady (probably late 60's) was standing near our table waiting for her family to catch up. She was a standard-issue older lady... except she had (intentionally) dyed blue hair. Well, my girlfriend said WAY too loudly \"omG! LoOk At ThaT 80 yEaR oLd WomANs Blue hAir!! HAHA\" Her best friend chimed in with the same critique. They kept saying things like \"Why do old woman do that, are they trying to be young?\" and impersonating her: \"this will make my granddaughter think I'm COOL\" and laughing and so on.\r  \n\r  \nTHE WOMAN COULD HEAR EVERY WORD. The first mention of the word blue hair and I saw her eyes dart straight towards us. The best friend said to my gf : \"It's you when you're in your 80's, HAHAHA\" and my gf said \"OH GOD, no, hahahaha\"... after a minute or two, she had enough and walked outside to wait for her party, looking VERY sad in my opinion. \r  \n When we got back home, after a few hours, my girlfriend said \"Jeez, how about that woman with the blue hair, RIGHT?\"\r  \nWell, told her how I thought they were being mean. How that woman heard EVERYTHING and how her actions may have impacted this poor woman. (Now... there is absolutely a chance the woman didn't give a shit and thought \"fuck you\". We'll never know.)\r  \n\r  \nMy girlfriend and her best friend were viciously bullied as kids. My girlfriend is an amazing, sweet, caring and thoughtful person. She never intended for that woman to hear. But her and her best friend have been \"people-watching\" like this since they were kids. When I let her know that es, that woman ABSOLUTELY was listening and seemed quite hurt, my girlfriend just BROKE DOWN. BAWLING crying, snot bubbles, shaking and all. She said she felt so bad and knew what it was like to be bullied. She immediately owned up and said she just wished she could apologize. I felt terrible now OF COURSE, and backpedaled and just focused on this being a \"teachable moment\" and that nobody is perfect and she's still of course a good, sweet person. Just a tipsy error in judgement. But she was locked in on guilt. She had to take a sedative to stop crying and sleep. I held her for hours while she cried and mumbled \"^(I'm so sorry...)\" It really brought her back to being bullied as a kid, and how she felt when It happened. But those bullies said it LOUD, directly, peppered with \"loser\", \"freak\", etc, we all know how bullies do. My girlfriend is not a bully. She just never thought about the consequences of shit talking before. She IS a good person. So is her best friend. \r  \nAnyways reddit... AITA???

As an adult, I had a much better social life--easier to find fellow weirdos--but I would still ruthlessly exclude other people in social situations if I didn't like them. My rationalization was they could suck it up like I did.\n\nI was a junior in college before other people pointed out to me that I was being really mean, and that just because it was done to me didn't mean it was okay to do to other people. I'm in my thirties now, and I really go out of my way to make sure people feel included now. But that was not my natural impulse despite my childhood experiences.\n\nI think the girlfriend in this story sounds incredibly manipulative and is playing OP like a fiddle. But I don't think that means she wasn't bullied as a kid. Though she could certainly be lying.", "I\u2019m glad you used past tense. Sounds like he was a serious energy vampire.", "I had a boyfriend like this too. I would be upset at him about something. He would get upset that I was upset at him, and it always turned into me comforting him", "I\u2019ve dated this guy too. He was a compulsive liar and do thief, and if I ever called him out he\u2019d have a breakdown.", ">Just thinking of the effect on everyone around them at that moment.\n\nUnderstandable, but seeing someone stand up for her is probably better than what happened.   \n\n\nIn fact, if that was my mother and we showed up at a restaurant, with her waiting outside in the cold for some reason, and she told me that was why?  Someone in their party calling out their BS is way better than someone directly impacted by it, simply due to tempers/etc.", "This is 100% a thing, and I wish more counselors and parents talked about it. Depending on grade/school it was, I was either neutral or mildly popular, so it wouldn't have helped the other kids to hear it from me. \n\nSemi-related, shy people often come across as stuck-up until one gets to know them better. Adults have (should have) advanced social skills. Kids do not.", "He\u2019s dead now . May he rest in piss. #SorryNotSorry", ">May he rest in piss.\n\nThank you, kind Redditor, for a phrase I will no doubt use often years from now.  In hopefully fewer rather than more years...
