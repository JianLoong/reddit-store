No matter how much money you eventually make.\n\nShe's confusing \"amount spent on a gift\" with \"amount of love someone feels for me.\"  And she needs therapy to work on that because it's not healthy.\n\nSome of the best gifts I've received from close friends were very inexpensive, but they were personally meaningful to me (such as a specific keychain, a bed cover with pictures of my former kitties, etc).\n\nAnd, FWIW, I know of a parent whose kids make great money.  The parent **does not want expensive gifts from them**.  She's explicitly said this.

To me, flowers are lovely and getting a handmade card is just the best, and ofc I spend time with my son.

In all honesty, your mom sounds textbook narcissistic. Never happy with your gifts, claiming the gift is a direct reflection of how much you care (or don't care), comparing what she receives to what people she knows receive. I'm sorry that you have to deal with that. Assuming she is truly a narcissist, she will never be happy with anything you give her so I don't blame you for giving up trying.

What she got was much better than nothing at all", "I'd say to her I'm not getting you anything.\n\nIf she say why?
