I sat on the toilet for maybe an hour as liquid shit rocketed out of my body and I was beyond relieved when it was over. Other than the initial stomach cramps, there really was no pain so I'd suggest she try castor oil. Beyond that to prevent this problem again she can try eating prunes, drinking prune juice and taking probiotics daily. If she has to result to manually removing whatever is lodged inside of her, she needs to do it with extreme care. I've read that you're really not supposed to do this yourself and if things go wrong I wanna say it can lead to an embolism.
