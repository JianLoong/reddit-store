He put the papers down and reached in his pocket to grab his wallet, paying and going on his way.\n\nI told my bosses about what happened and they were really happy I did that, but one of my coworkers thinks it was a little extreme.

I didn't notice any mention of what country OP is in....", "I get it man; sometimes you gotta type these things out to put them in perspective.\n\nLike theft is theft; you should ask her if you guys were say an appliance shop and this guy tried to steal 50 televisions or toasters if *only then* it would be a \"big deal\"?\n\nIt doesn't change the fact this guy tried to leverage your already fragile trust in him to swindle you. You had adequate claim to be dubious with him, and then when boxed into a corner he folded. You're a small business and you shouldn't have to take that.", "You think they know about it? \n\nHe might be doing the newspaper run for them and he is pocketing the money.", "I watched that Tiktok too and it's the girl who opens bottles of beer really fast.
