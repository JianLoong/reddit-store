Sister might stop being a BM bc of this\n\nI am getting married in a few months and think I have been fair so far taking into account everyone\u2019s opinions. For BM dresses I even picked options in different styles and am having the BM pick one they like. Almost every time a BM or family member has brought up a preference, my fianc\u00e9 and I have done our best to find a solution so everyone is happy\n\nMy sister and I have never gotten along, but found out from my mom it was important to her to be in my bridal party (BP). She never mentioned being my MOH or BM before but she expected to be my MOH despite us not being friends and her not playing any role in my relationship with my fianc\u00e9. I instead asked my one of my best friends who is close with us as a couple for a very long time\n\nWhen I asked my sister to be a BM she hung up on me and I had to apologize for not asking her to be my MOH as she \u201cisn\u2019t going to apologize for having feelings\u201d. I\u2019ve let this go and she agreed to be a BM\n\nI called her yesterday and she found every reason she could bring up that I\u2019m making her and my family mad. This included a convo I had with my mom when I said I wanted all the BM hair to look somewhat consistent, just the same style adjusted for different lengths so they all look cohesive. Mom was mad that I wasn\u2019t going to ask my BP but instead tell them what I wanted. All my friends know that I\u2019m easy going and opened to compromise but she refused to see my perspective and focused on that she thought my attitude was out of check. I reminded her that planing my wedding isn\u2019t the time for me to be a people pleaser, like I\u2019ve been conditioned to do my whole life\n\nMy sister brought up the convo w/o knowing how I wanted the hair to look (1/2 up 1/2 down) and decided I was as wrong as my mom had decided, that the bride doesn\u2019t get to pick the BP\u2019s hair bc it\u2019s their bodies and I can\u2019t tell them what to do and she doesn\u2019t have to do anything she doesn\u2019t want to. I told her that I would figure out an alternative that worked for everyone if there were issues. She kept going back to that I am wrong. I l think it\u2019s normal for the bride to pick how the BP hair looks her wedding and pictures. I told my sister calmly that if she feels that strongly about this that it is her choice to not participate and it would make me upset but she can if she wants to. Just I need to know to make other plans and to take time to think about it. She agreed to think on it and get back to me. I expect her to still be BM because ultimately it\u2019s about her and she wants the attention\n\nI called my MOH after the phone call with my sister for advice and she thought I was being fair and liked the idea for hair and my approach to the wedding\n\nAITA for picking how the BP hair looks for my wedding and for fighting for what\u2019s important to me?\n\nEdit for clarification: I am not asking anyone to permanently change their hair or cut or dye it. I just want them styled similarly. My bridal party has differ t lengths, colors, and textures of hair and I will work with them all to find something that makes them each confident and comfortable as I have with the dresses.\n\nAdditional edit: I have confirmation from all but one bridesmaid (who I just haven\u2019t heard back from yet) that they all love the hair idea. My sister didn\u2019t even say if she disliked the hair idea just that she was upset about feeling like she was being told what to do. To all those asking, her behavior is nothing new. I have been dealing with it my whole life but cutting someone out is a lot easier said than done because it causes a lot of other issues. \nThank you all for your input.

Right now it's the hairstyle. Before it was not being asked to be MOH. Next it will be the dress, maybe? Or which groomsman escorts her? Or the order they enter/exit? All of the above?

When I was a bride, we went with a super small bridal party. Just my MOH and their best man. MOH was very pregnant unexpectedly at the time of the wedding, so she wore the only dress she owned that fit over her belly at that time. Which happened to be a black sweater dress, lol. We hadn't focused on color schemes or anything like that, so it was fine.\n\nOne of my stints as a bridesmaid was for a bride who wanted all BMs to wear red dresses, no preference for dresses otherwise. No preference on hair, makeup, etc.\n\nFor another BM stint, the bride wanted a specific dress in a specific color, same for shoes. She also had very specific makeup/hairstyles she wanted us to go with, while taking into consideration the fact that there were women of multiple different races, with very different haircuts/lengths, etc. So she basically had a makeup artist do our makeup according to what the bride's vision was, and a hairstylist to do the same. No one bitched, no one pouted, no one threw a fit.\n\nNow, I was a non-traditional bride. I just wanted folks to show up, eat the food I paid for, and have a good time. But girls are raised with the expectation that their wedding is going to be the most important day of their whole entire lives and that if anything isn't absolutely perfect, they've somehow failed. So if a woman is planning her wedding, with the history and weight of all that societal pressure, and she wants me to wear my hair in a mohawk and wear an ugly olive green taffeta gown for a few hours to make her feel better supported, fuck it. I'll wear the gown and the mohawk for a few hours. And if they want me to do something like color my hair, have it otherwise chemically processed, or do something I'm truly not comfortable with, ***I can simply politely decline to be the bridesmaid.*** An invitation is not a subpoena.\n\nSo while I agree that I'd never ask my closest friends/family to wear a specific hairstyle/makeup/dress for me, it's not some massive offense to do that for my friend's wedding if that's what she wants.\n\nOP: NTA.

You really made a mistake going there in the first place because it's going to cause drama to reverse that decision, but if you want to enjoy your wedding you probably should.", "Nta\n\n\n>When I asked my sister to be a BM she hung up on me and I had to apologize for not asking her to be my MOH as she \u201cisn\u2019t going to apologize for having feelings\u201d. I\u2019ve let this go and she agreed to be a BM\n\nYou would think your sister is the one getting married with this bridezilla attitude. Treat this like a business transaction and tell your sister that you appreciate all her input but this arrangement is not going to work and she has been moved from BM to guest. I would also tell any family that if they are not happy with this decision they do not have to come to the wedding. It is supposed to be your day and you seem very reasonable in the request you have asked", "NTA, your sister is. She sounds exhausting.", "Nta, when you agree to be a bridesmaid you are basically accepting your role as an ensemble member for that wedding. What the bride/groom wants is what goes.", "NTA\n\nNone of your requests sound overly onerous, expensive, painful, or permanent. \n\nHalf up half down is a vague term covering a bunch of weddingy styles, it's like saying \"please wear a blue knee length formal dress\".", "Easygoing people don\u2019t choose other people\u2019s hairstyles.  ESH", "Op I feel you about having a complainy bridesmaid. I picked a color and length for bm dresses and am letting bridesmaids pick. When I told my sister, she snidely commented that she thought it looked better when everyone wore the same dress (like they did at HER wedding). She found out we were doing a wedding outside bc it was the best price we could get for a venue and she commented that usually outdoor weddings are tacky \"but you save on flowers that way!\" When discussing that the wedding was going to be outdoors, she asked about the weather (she lives in a subtropical climate, the wedding is early may in the part of a country that has seasons) and I told her it was going to be in the 70s/high 60s she said \"that's so cold!!\" And looked genuinely horrified. Same thing has been happening with every thought I have about bach party. She fought me on every location I suggested, every theme I thought of, and every activity I want to do. I'm in the process of planning my own itinerary and reaching out to bm's for their budget/availability myself bc she's stressing me tf out lmao\n\nOh and NTA at all", "NTA I was my sister\u2019s MOH. Let\u2019s just say that I spent $400 (back in the 90s so that was A LOT)\u2026 on a purple dress and shoes that I never wore again\u2026 I wore my hair in a beehive\u2026 And my makeup consisted of stripey cheeks and winged eye liner\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t actually recognise myself in the photos. People see the framed photo on my tv stand and ask me who is that person.\n\nWould I wear this hideous outfit again if my sister asked me to join in her vow renewal? Yes. It\u2019s her day. If she wants a bunch of embarrassing wedding photos littering her house forevermore\u2026 that\u2019s her prerogative\u2026", "op=NTA(what a surprise).\n\nTo have a particular one day style request is not unreasonable.  \n\nIt's a shame that your people-pleasing training makes it impossible for you to say, \"*I understand your objection to being in my bridal party.  I welcome you being a guest still*.\"", "NTA\n\nBasic styling requests that don't require cutting or dying of hair for your wedding attendants are normal and if your sister doesn't want to get with the program she can watch the wedding from a seat in the audience or not attend.", "Day of? Won\u2019t care. But those pictures that will remind you of the event forever. 100% will care. Bridesmaids hairstyle is chosen by the bride.", "she's literally relaxed AF and her hair request is \"half up half down in a way that suits the particular bridesmaids length and texture of hair\"", "When you agree to be a member of the bridal party you are agreeing to part of the brides vision, whatever that may be (assuming its not dangerous). If you don't like it then you can back out.", "lol, it was bowel movement for me \ud83d\ude06", "I've seen this go either way. I wish all brides would pay for it, but thats not aways in budget. The biggest thing is that whichever way it's going to go needs to be communicated to the bridal party and they need to be on board.", "That\u2019s really smart.", "It\u2019s definitely not standard but it definitely should be.\n\nI\u2019ve had to pay for my own but also had mine paid for. I paid for my BMs. It\u2019s incredibly tacky not to pay for hair & makeup if you are requiring it.", "I fully agree, just stating that the norm in my experience has never been that the bride pays, even when there's a required hairstyle. I think it's a self-repeating cycle where everyone is just like \"I had to pay for my hair at her wedding so I'm not about to pay for her now that she's in mine\" and it just keeps going.", "My friends clearly are more reasonable and know a bridesmaid wearing a different hairstyle isn\u2019t going to ruin their photos.", "It wouldn\u2019t make them unreasonable to prefer a certain hairstyle for their event. It just makes you ridged and judgmental for not understanding at all.", "NTA.  It doesn't sound like your sister AND mom like you at all.  Why do you cater to them so much?  Establish boundaries and stop being a doormat for them.  I wouldn't invite either of them to the wedding.  What a couple of energy vampires.", "NTA but you need to stop giving in to your sister\u2019s tantrums and stand up for yourself. This is a party all about you and your fianc\u00e9 but you sister is intent on making it about her and your mom is enabling her. Stop it now. Don\u2019t ruin your special day to appease your family.", "NTA. Let your sister disinvite herself from your wedding. She sounds like a nightmare.", "YTA. That\u2019s super controlling and weird.", "NTA but your mum and sister sound insufferable. Personally, I'd kick your sister out for being difficult for the sake of it (being petty and putting added stress on you) and set clear boundaries with your mum", "NTA. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with wanting a similar hair style, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re asking them to dye their hair or some other crazy thing (which we have seen here a lot). I also think your sister (and your mom) are just causing you extra stress.  I really think you need to demote her to guest or uninvite completely", "NTA - It\u2019s your wedding, not hers. Come to think of it, I would hate to see how she would act as a bride\u2026", "NTA, kick your sister out of the wedding entirely if she can\u2019t get her act together", "And get security.", "Well it's rather fortunate that OP is planning to have their hair professionally styled and to pay for it.", "If you can't do a half-up half-down, you likely have someone already assisting you with your clothing and shoes due to your lack of mobility/dexterity/cognitive ability.\n\nEdit for anyone who doesn't know the style: it's a ponytail. But with the hair close to the neck hanging loose.", "But 1/2 up 1/2 down is one of the simplest hair styles and a lot of women grew up wearing that style at some point in their lives. It doesn't sound like she wants a really complicated version of it. It's a matter of getting a brush or comb, brushing the sides and/or front back and securing it with a barrette or hair clip. It doesn't even sound like she's requiring them to curl their hair. If one of the BMs is having problems, I'm sure someone else could spare 2 minutes and pull it back for them."]}
