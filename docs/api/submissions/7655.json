Sister might stop being a BM bc of this\n\nI am getting married in a few months and think I have been fair so far taking into account everyone\u2019s opinions. For BM dresses I even picked options in different styles and am having the BM pick one they like. Almost every time a BM or family member has brought up a preference, my fianc\u00e9 and I have done our best to find a solution so everyone is happy\n\nMy sister and I have never gotten along, but found out from my mom it was important to her to be in my bridal party (BP). She never mentioned being my MOH or BM before but she expected to be my MOH despite us not being friends and her not playing any role in my relationship with my fianc\u00e9. I instead asked my one of my best friends who is close with us as a couple for a very long time\n\nWhen I asked my sister to be a BM she hung up on me and I had to apologize for not asking her to be my MOH as she \u201cisn\u2019t going to apologize for having feelings\u201d. I\u2019ve let this go and she agreed to be a BM\n\nI called her yesterday and she found every reason she could bring up that I\u2019m making her and my family mad. This included a convo I had with my mom when I said I wanted all the BM hair to look somewhat consistent, just the same style adjusted for different lengths so they all look cohesive. Mom was mad that I wasn\u2019t going to ask my BP but instead tell them what I wanted. All my friends know that I\u2019m easy going and opened to compromise but she refused to see my perspective and focused on that she thought my attitude was out of check. I reminded her that planing my wedding isn\u2019t the time for me to be a people pleaser, like I\u2019ve been conditioned to do my whole life\n\nMy sister brought up the convo w/o knowing how I wanted the hair to look (1/2 up 1/2 down) and decided I was as wrong as my mom had decided, that the bride doesn\u2019t get to pick the BP\u2019s hair bc it\u2019s their bodies and I can\u2019t tell them what to do and she doesn\u2019t have to do anything she doesn\u2019t want to. I told her that I would figure out an alternative that worked for everyone if there were issues. She kept going back to that I am wrong. I l think it\u2019s normal for the bride to pick how the BP hair looks her wedding and pictures. I told my sister calmly that if she feels that strongly about this that it is her choice to not participate and it would make me upset but she can if she wants to. Just I need to know to make other plans and to take time to think about it. She agreed to think on it and get back to me. I expect her to still be BM because ultimately it\u2019s about her and she wants the attention\n\nI called my MOH after the phone call with my sister for advice and she thought I was being fair and liked the idea for hair and my approach to the wedding\n\nAITA for picking how the BP hair looks for my wedding and for fighting for what\u2019s important to me?\n\nEdit for clarification: I am not asking anyone to permanently change their hair or cut or dye it. I just want them styled similarly. My bridal party has differ t lengths, colors, and textures of hair and I will work with them all to find something that makes them each confident and comfortable as I have with the dresses.\n\nAdditional edit: I have confirmation from all but one bridesmaid (who I just haven\u2019t heard back from yet) that they all love the hair idea. My sister didn\u2019t even say if she disliked the hair idea just that she was upset about feeling like she was being told what to do. To all those asking, her behavior is nothing new. I have been dealing with it my whole life but cutting someone out is a lot easier said than done because it causes a lot of other issues. \nThank you all for your input.

Right now it's the hairstyle. Before it was not being asked to be MOH. Next it will be the dress, maybe? Or which groomsman escorts her? Or the order they enter/exit? All of the above?

When I was a bride, we went with a super small bridal party. Just my MOH and their best man. MOH was very pregnant unexpectedly at the time of the wedding, so she wore the only dress she owned that fit over her belly at that time. Which happened to be a black sweater dress, lol. We hadn't focused on color schemes or anything like that, so it was fine.\n\nOne of my stints as a bridesmaid was for a bride who wanted all BMs to wear red dresses, no preference for dresses otherwise. No preference on hair, makeup, etc.\n\nFor another BM stint, the bride wanted a specific dress in a specific color, same for shoes. She also had very specific makeup/hairstyles she wanted us to go with, while taking into consideration the fact that there were women of multiple different races, with very different haircuts/lengths, etc. So she basically had a makeup artist do our makeup according to what the bride's vision was, and a hairstylist to do the same. No one bitched, no one pouted, no one threw a fit.\n\nNow, I was a non-traditional bride. I just wanted folks to show up, eat the food I paid for, and have a good time. But girls are raised with the expectation that their wedding is going to be the most important day of their whole entire lives and that if anything isn't absolutely perfect, they've somehow failed. So if a woman is planning her wedding, with the history and weight of all that societal pressure, and she wants me to wear my hair in a mohawk and wear an ugly olive green taffeta gown for a few hours to make her feel better supported, fuck it. I'll wear the gown and the mohawk for a few hours. And if they want me to do something like color my hair, have it otherwise chemically processed, or do something I'm truly not comfortable with, ***I can simply politely decline to be the bridesmaid.*** An invitation is not a subpoena.\n\nSo while I agree that I'd never ask my closest friends/family to wear a specific hairstyle/makeup/dress for me, it's not some massive offense to do that for my friend's wedding if that's what she wants.\n\nOP: NTA.
