My sister and I don't have a close relationship and I can't say there was ever a time I considered her a friend or even a good family member. Most of it isn't truly her fault but times like these I do place more on her.\n\nMy parents believed that being the older sister, I needed to make sacrifices for her. If we were getting takeout and she wanted pizza and I wanted Chinese, well, she was the baby so I should agree with pizza for her sake. If we both had birthday party invites for the same day well she should get to go and I should be fine staying home. Same with going to see a movie as a family. Or choosing where to go on vacation. We were all supposed to get a vote but hers always counted as two so after a while it seemed pointless. When we got older it was often a thing I would need to cancel plans if she had plans my parents couldn't take her to, or if they needed someone to watch her, and then they would order food before they left, so she'd get what she wanted and I'd just have to deal. I know stuff like that isn't uncommon and in moderation I don't think it's awful. But there was never any balance. My parents would argue that being older meant I had more freedom and that was what I should focus on. But that freedom meant nothing because I couldn't make the most of it.\n\nMy sister grew to expect I would always let her get her way and when she turned 17 and I had been out of the house, and out of her life and my parents lives, she reached out and wanted to know why I left and I told her. She told me she'd do better and we started to repair things and I would call her on being selfish. But it hasn't really improved and I have felt the relationship is more of a chore than a joy in my life.\n\nA few weeks ago I got engaged to my partner and I asked my three closest friends to be my bridesmaids and I chose to forgo the maid of honor because all three are equally loved by me. She assumed she was my maid of honor and I told her she wasn't. She wanted to know why and I told her maid of honor is a special role and we're not close enough for that. She then comes out with how she deserves it for being a good sister and how I'm being mean and taking the past out on her. I told her she had done nothing to deserve being maid of honor. That it's not the past when it still actively happens and she still tries to get me to treat her like her choice is worth more than mine. She started to cry and told me she'd been trying and I'm being mean to her instead of giving her time. But it's been 5 years of me calling out her BS, and of me telling her when she's acting like she has since we were kids. I think she expects me to always just deal with it under the guise of time. But she ended up leaving and was really upset. She told me after that she understood I didn't always like her but that I was really mean with what I said.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678206187, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11l3qj1/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_has_done_nothing/", "score": 2477, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents are the one who favored your sister. You resent her and label her spoiled. Your sister did what any child does - a child enjoys doing what he/she likes.

I was the  \"brat\". Her needs were legit. Mine bratty winny etc. My sister saw me through the same lens as my parents and it hurts! It hurts incredibly badly to have a sister constantly telling you are undesirable. \n\nObviously, You don't have to like the favoritism. It's valid for your bridesmaids to be people who you feel good with.  However, take a few steps back from your resentment of your sister--. You are responsible for your end of the relationship.

No she is not entitled to everything, but neither are you entitled to  call her spoiled or be spiteful for your parents actions.", "NTA but please take into consideration that your sister\u2018s brain basically got taught from early childhood that is totally fine that her wishes matter more than yours. So getting away from this habit is really difficult once it is installed like that in a person. Don\u2019t want to say cave in, your bounderies and wishes do matter, but it might be a longer process than you anticipated to get her to change that behaviour. That\u2019s sad and requires also a real effort from her part. \nShe\u2019s young, immature maybe. And might not have realised the meaning of what a Maid of honour is to the bride. You seem to be quite disappointed in her, don\u2018t let this feeling get you to much. Stick to your boundaries, point out when she\u2019s trying to get it her way, stay calm and give her a bit more time to mature. She\u2019s got this persona installed from birth on from your parents.
