My sister and I don't have a close relationship and I can't say there was ever a time I considered her a friend or even a good family member. Most of it isn't truly her fault but times like these I do place more on her.\n\nMy parents believed that being the older sister, I needed to make sacrifices for her. If we were getting takeout and she wanted pizza and I wanted Chinese, well, she was the baby so I should agree with pizza for her sake. If we both had birthday party invites for the same day well she should get to go and I should be fine staying home. Same with going to see a movie as a family. Or choosing where to go on vacation. We were all supposed to get a vote but hers always counted as two so after a while it seemed pointless. When we got older it was often a thing I would need to cancel plans if she had plans my parents couldn't take her to, or if they needed someone to watch her, and then they would order food before they left, so she'd get what she wanted and I'd just have to deal. I know stuff like that isn't uncommon and in moderation I don't think it's awful. But there was never any balance. My parents would argue that being older meant I had more freedom and that was what I should focus on. But that freedom meant nothing because I couldn't make the most of it.\n\nMy sister grew to expect I would always let her get her way and when she turned 17 and I had been out of the house, and out of her life and my parents lives, she reached out and wanted to know why I left and I told her. She told me she'd do better and we started to repair things and I would call her on being selfish. But it hasn't really improved and I have felt the relationship is more of a chore than a joy in my life.\n\nA few weeks ago I got engaged to my partner and I asked my three closest friends to be my bridesmaids and I chose to forgo the maid of honor because all three are equally loved by me. She assumed she was my maid of honor and I told her she wasn't. She wanted to know why and I told her maid of honor is a special role and we're not close enough for that. She then comes out with how she deserves it for being a good sister and how I'm being mean and taking the past out on her. I told her she had done nothing to deserve being maid of honor. That it's not the past when it still actively happens and she still tries to get me to treat her like her choice is worth more than mine. She started to cry and told me she'd been trying and I'm being mean to her instead of giving her time. But it's been 5 years of me calling out her BS, and of me telling her when she's acting like she has since we were kids. I think she expects me to always just deal with it under the guise of time. But she ended up leaving and was really upset. She told me after that she understood I didn't always like her but that I was really mean with what I said.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678206187, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11l3qj1/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_has_done_nothing/", "score": 1181, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's valid for your bridesmaids to be people who you feel good with.  However, take a few steps back from your resentment of your sister--. You are responsible for your end of the relationship.

So getting away from this habit is really difficult once it is installed like that in a person.

That\u2019s sad and requires also a real effort from her part. \nShe\u2019s young, immature maybe. And might not have realised the meaning of what a Maid of honour is to the bride.

Stick to your boundaries, point out when she\u2019s trying to get it her way, stay calm and give her a bit more time to mature. She\u2019s got this persona installed from birth on from your parents. That\u2019s really difficult to breakfast away from.

She's 22 and responsible for herself. She knows how to access a therapist and the consequences of not doing that are squarely on her. It's not like you haven't tried hard for 5 entire years.", "Have you asked her if she has the same entitled attitude with her friends. If she doesn't, then she is capable of acting as a friend. If she acts the same way with her friends, then she needs counselling. NTA", "This doesn\u2019t sound at all like an equal sibling relationship. She\u2019s fighting for your approval, and you\u2019re judging her maturity and progress. You were out of her life from her ages 13-17, and she has spent the past five years actively trying to build a relationship on your terms. It sounds like you don\u2019t like her, and don\u2019t value the relationship - that\u2019s fine but is it a kindness to prolong this if she can never overcome your shared childhood? Do you ever see a relationship where you can coexist as sisters without her having to compensate for the past?", "I mean, it depends on a lot of factors.  17-22 is a period of growth for a lot of people.  But many people still come out of college immature, even if they are, objectively, more mature than when they went in.  So I would argue its about how much growth there has been from where she was to where she is now.  \n\nNo one is going from a spoiled brat to a super selfless person in 5 years, barring some intense life changes.  But if she is much improved, then I'd say that counts for something.", "My oldest sister ( I am the youngest of 5, she is 15 years older than I) is my best friend. Growing up, yes she babysat me, but she also willingly spent time with me. When she moved out, she would have me & my other 2 sisters over for sleepovers at her apartment.

And I have wanted to see improvements but so far there are none.", "Yes, there should have been significant changes in 5 years since her sister is the one reaching out.

Certainly not OPs. I hate that guilt tripping bs. NTA op", "Agree with reconciliation being exhausting. I'm also estranged from my sisters because, while I like to think I've forgiven them for everything they did to me as a child, there's just not enough trust to try and rebuild anything - it's so exhausting and frustrating to try and let down your guard around someone when they keep backsliding into old patterns. Not to mention there's not any goodwill or fond memories that I'm trying to \"get back to\" as it were - at least for me, it feels like I'm trying to build a relationship with a total stranger who hurt me very badly... and in that scenario you can only give them so many chances. So I walked away.\n\nIf you want it, my advice is to gently but firmly tell her that you're tired of trying to help her change and you'd like to step away from the relationship indefinitely. If she lets you go peacefully, leave the lines of communication open but quiet. If she throws a tantrum, block her. I hope that if you want to reconcile with her, that you're able to do so later in life once she's grown out of this (though she may never grow out of it).

Shame on them for putting that on you. You should have both been equal and their eyes, and both received fair treatment.
