Why would she be entitled to it back?", "NTA. That's not how gifts work... \n\nAlso \"Hi, remember that time I terrorized you with a prank gift? Yeah, I'd like you to send me money now\".\n\nBlock her.", "Wow, what a crazy equivalent to shaking out the couch cushions. She's tacky, delusional and desperate. NTA", "NTA. Whats wrong with your friends and family?! She\u2019s calling you terrible names and they should come to your defence.", "I don't believe any of this happened.  Toss in a fake request to go to prom too why dontcha.", "I don't believe the story is true. \nSince OP would have mentioned if the bully had been a pregnant Teenager, it must all have happened AFTER they lost sight after graduation.  \nSo within 3 years after high school she became a drug addict AND got married AND is pregnant with her 4th kid?\nSounds too little time for all that, even if she had twins...  \nAnd bullying that extreme doesn't really just stop just like this, and the victims don't really forget about their bullies...\nAnd nobody would ever call anyone TAH for not giving back a cheap gift from years ago to someone who is an AH...", "Also in the three years since graduating high school the bully had time to get addicted to drugs (which was also evident through her social media) and get pregnant 4 times? I call bullshit.", "Exactly what I was thinking. As soon as she had that money she'd spend it on drugs and not her family.", "I read it as she wants money for drugs", "Yeah, think of how desperate she must be to go through all this shit for less than $100 of crap.  And she's reaching out to somebody she used to bully and hasn't seen in years over this distant and obscure claim ... Imagine all the bridges she must have burned and everything she must have begged, borrowed or stolen to get to the point where this was the best option.  This has gotta be pretty close to rock bottom.", "Bullies. Addicts.", "Quick eBay search showed the entire set to be worth $28-$35.  Seems like just enough to get a fix.", " NTA.  It was your birthday gift.  What kind of person takes back a gift?", "They called you \u201chappy meal\u201d and threw French fries at you? What the actual hell? Who does that??\n\nNTA.", "Doordash her a Happy Meal.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I\u2019m glad karma has worked her over. She deserves all of this and more.", "NTA. Fuck that person. And it's wild to me that like given what you've said about how you enjoyed collecting those toys how easy it would've been for the bullying 'gift' to have been an actual, thoughtful gift. Astonishing how people can put as much thought into being cruel as they could into being kind.", "NTA Bully shouldn't of been a bully!", "NTA \n\n\ud83d\udea8 DO NOT GIVE THEM BACK  \ud83d\udea8\n\nIf I could write that in giant, flashing lights I would.\n\nShe was a high school bully. She got the payback every bully deserves and so few of them ever get by seeing how much money her nasty trick was now worth. You've taught her a valuable lesson. Don't give her a penny more.\n\nIf you want to do something to assuage your conscience (if you do feel bad, I don't think you need to feel bad), sell the toys and give the money to a drug rehab charity.", "NTA\n\nI can't believe the gall of some people. And it sounds like she's still a bully.", "Keep the toy. Your former bully deserves nothing and she gave the toy to you. You are the owner of the toy and she has no right to it now.  NTA", "NTA those were a birthday gift. Tell her to go donate plasma. \ud83d\ude46\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. She created her own problems.  Not your responsibility to fund what's likely to be drugs.", "NTA and who are you talking to???? How on earth are you in the wrong here\u2026", "Nobody in a right mind would ask for birthday gifts back, especially after 5 years. NTA.", " NTA those toys belong to you now and honestly seeing how much they are I\u2019d sell them and use the money for whatever you like", "It is a gift, even a mean spirited one, in what world do people just roll up and ask you to give their gift back to them so they can sell it? That\u2019s not how gifts work at all", "Karma just drove up to her and gave her a slap.  NTA", "NTA", "'Karma's a bitch, and a gift is a gift'\n\nOP is definitely NTA.", "Unbelievable. What a clown. NTA, obviously. Hope you are well, cheers!", "Sounds like a rock bottom situation for the former bully if true.", "drugs are a hell of a drug", "Right? \nThe bully who now is broke and on drugs and out of work and with a useless husband and pregnant with her fourth child?\nWithin 3 years?", "100%", "NTA\n\nThey were a gift, irregardless of whether they were given to you as part of a bullying campaign or not. I can't understand why your friends and family would call you an arsehole for refusing to give one of your bullies a gift of $100. Why should you reward her for bullying you.", "NTA --- How can you even think you are.", "NTA.  You told her no - just stick to that.  She has no right to the toy and it sounds like karma has come and bitten her in the ass.  Block her and don't think about her again.", "NTA your friends and family should be ashamed of themselves.", "I would distinctly say I was sending her some money, and then send the amount to buy a singular happy meal. NTA", "NTA", "This whole sub is made up bullshit.", "Maybe before you criticize others for their writing mistakes, you should check to make sure that you haven't made any of your own. Or risk looking stupid, like you've done here.", "Drugs do be drugging", "Good point.", "Darn!! I've been saving all my kids' ones for almost nothing!!", "My dad's been saving ours for 35 years.  I bet some might be worth something."]}
