You don't owe someone that bullied you and made your life hell for a period of time anything, even if they actually changed or apologized. Sorry, but if it's worth less than $100, surely she has something else that she can sell that's worth the same or more.

She needs to understand that if she wants to have money she will have to beat her addictions. It\u2019s likely she would have sold it for more drugs and alcohol.
