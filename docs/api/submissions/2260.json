Everyone made fun of me for being so excited about the gift and I was called \u201cHappy meal\u201d for the rest of the year, my bully would sometimes throw McDonald\u2019s French fires at me or put the wrappers for McDonald\u2019s burgers on my desk before class, but the bullying only lasted till the end of 10th grade. Sometimes somebody would call me \u201chappy meal\u201d or \u201cFrench fry\u201d but nobody cared anymore. I forgot about my bully after I graduated and moved to a different province for university.. well I forgot about her until last week. She had randomly texted me out of the blue on instagram, I actually didn\u2019t even recognize her from her profile picture, but when I checked her account I was shocked to find out it was her. After high school she had become addicted to drugs and alcohol, and she was pregnant with her 4th kid. She was obviously not in the financial state for 4 kids. She had texted me and apologized for bullying me and I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and be friendly back but it was obvious she wanted something from me. After talking for about twenty minutes she brought up the birthday present she had given me five years ago, and asked if I still had it.

Hey I am sorry for making your life hell, btw do you still have that gift, I would like it back, because it is worth money now lmao.\n\nThey are not sorry, they just wanted the toy (money)", "NTA\n\nObviously. Seriously. It was a gift . Set aside the bullying, the addiction, all the other crap. It was a gift, and the other person is the A-hole for asking for it back.\n\nAnd let me add something to you personally. Maybe you already know you're NTA, and are just posting this for entertainment. If so, that's cool - it makes reddit go 'round.

She has fallen off her rocker if she thinks you should give them back. No, nope, nuhuh! Nice try. She afforded you zero sympathy back then, and I think you should reciprocate that \"kindness\" back to her.You reap what you sow, and she is learning that the hard way.", "NTA.
