First, she has to ask her husband for money. If he says no, she needs to go to the favored son.

In my mind, it\u2019s their responsibility to make sure their needs are met and if they can\u2019t who\u2019s responsibility is it? Certainly not yours, you don\u2019t owe her anything. Even if she treated you wonderfully and gave you everything - that was her job as a mother when she decided to bring a life into this world, she doesn\u2019t get to turn around and play the victim because of a choice she made. It doesn\u2019t work that way, especially for people like her who think they can treat other people poorly then ask for favors. Nope. I went NC with most of my family because it\u2019s none of their business how I live my life and it\u2019s none of your family\u2019s business how you live your life or how you spend your money or anything! They have a lot of fucking audacity to try to even say anything to you about your mother. \n\nSet boundaries. Be firm. Stick to them.

From what you stated, this not the case \n\nShe is an adult and there are other options, husband and your brother who is the golden child.

You pretty much made a life for yourself working hard and received no support from you mother, and being treated like a reject by her.  She\u2019s now fallen on hard times, instead of asking her favourite child (son) to help her she is asking the child she rejected because daughter is financially independent.  OP, let me tell you, blood is not always thicker than water.  Your mother treated you appallingly.  Her reasoning about how much she did for you when you were growing up is laughable.  You didn\u2019t ask to be born, she chose to have kids and it is her responsibility to be the best mother for all her children, which she failed by having a favourite child (your bro) and ignoring you. \n\nShe is an adult, she got herself into this mess, she need to get on her bike or pull up her bootstrap and sort her shit out.

Going with NTA because at any point your brother could have helped (or could still help), and your aunts, and your mom could do something about it too.  \n\nOn the other hand, imagining my mom asking me for money so they wouldn\u2019t lose their house (my mom and I did not have a great relationship when I was growing up)\u2026.If I had some extra, I would help because I would feel guilty about it for some reason. \n\nExamine your feelings- if you would feel guilty, maybe you feel some way about it and you could make a payment to the mortgage company or whatnot.

Either way, her actions made the bed she\u2019s laying in now and you aren\u2019t under any obligation to help unless you feel like it.", "If she\u2019s going to lose her house, help her out and \u201cloan\u201d the money to her, and she will most likely never contact you again because she won\u2019t be able to repay it.

I bet she'd figure it out.  \n\n\nI'm glad that you are doing great and that you are safer and secure!  \n\n\nAgain, NTA.", "Nta don't let your foot up and block them all.", "NTA", "i agree with the top response and then kindly remind your mother that her problems are her business.", "THIS! Also, your brother is perfectly capable of getting a job and contributing to the house that he's about to get kicked out of if your mom loses it. Time for both of them to stop mooching and start working.", "Bahahaha love this!", "This! \n\nOP, you\u2019re NTA. Your mom does not deserve your money.", "This is perfect", "Maybe, but she refuses to let him move in because she wants \"her space\". Even though he would financially contribute.", "I guess her troubles started when you moved out and stopped paying rent and then debt accumulated.", "Facts. All the justification and reason right there", ">Don\u2019t feel like shit OP she brought this on herself (I like to call it karma). It isn\u2019t your responsibility. And I without a shread of doubt know she would\u2019ve taken advantage of you if you said yes\n\nAlso, if the situations were reversed, there is no way that mom would lift a finger to help out OP. OP would be out in the cold and mom would be calling her a deadbeat who should be more like her brother. And all of these \"family members\" coming out of the woodwork to shame OP now, would pretend OP didn't even exist. \n\nFuck that nonsense. OP is so much better off just cutting contact with that whole side of the family.", "Even if I were to give her $1000, thats literally no help to her. And I would never see that money again, because she would not pay me back, even though she says she would. She's very bad with money.", "I disagree, I wouldn\u2019t give OP's mom a dime", "1000 is not token to me", "giving mom money now opens it up for the mom to ask for more in the future. OP becomes the family ATM: good enough to ask for money, but not good enough to treat as family", "if OP helps now, that opens the door for the mother to ask for more money in the future. \n\nThe mother should be asking *her husband* and *her 21 year old son who lives rent free* to help with the mortgage. she refuses? the foreclosure is on her, not the OP.\n\nNTA OP", "If you're going to loan money, get collateral. Take a security interest in the house (so long as there's equity in it). Take her wedding ring. Don't just put the money in a paper shredder.\n\nOP is 25. As well as she's doing, statistically she hasn't had enough time to accumulate enough wealth that she can loan anything that she isn't sure she'll get back. At this stage in life, she needs to put her money to work for her. Extra funds go into mutual funds, not the black hole that is her mother's finances.", "To be very honest, she will absolutely contact OP again when she inevitably needs more money. She will won't care that she already \"owes\" OP because in her mind it is the other way around. OP should NOT give her one red cent. Winning for OP is washing her hands of the whole situation, and living her best life without tying a couple of albatrosses around her neck.", "I have a similar situation with my mother, I took the high road for a long time...each person is different, I understand...but for me it wasn't win-win...I ended up just feeling used. The hurt of my childhood was just extended and I felt stupid.  When I was a child I couldn't defend myself, here I am as a adult and still allowing it to happen.", "A \"loan\" that OP won\u2019t get back. OP shouldn\u2019t have no guilt period refusing to help her mom out", "She can want her space, but you don't have to subsidize it.", "That's her choice. You didn't ask to be born and you didn't deserve to be her scapegoat. Don't give in, or you'll be supporting her for the rest of your life.", "Exactly", "Lol... exactly my point. I arbitrarily said $1000 but pick a dollar amount that would help her this time and tell her up front that you need that money back for whatever reason. When you don't get the money back, that can be your response the next time she asks for money. I know that it sounds passive aggressive and kind of obnoxious but it is genuinely the only way that I can say no to people who are close to me.", "That's probably the right thing to do but I would have a lot of trouble doing it with my mother", "Just a random number, it can be $100", "a thousand times this", "It's probably the right thing to do but sometimes the wrong thing is the better choice. I agree with everything you said, I just respectfully disagree with giving $1k"]}
