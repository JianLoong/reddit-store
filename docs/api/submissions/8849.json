First, she has to ask her husband for money. If he says no, she needs to go to the favored son.

In my mind, it\u2019s their responsibility to make sure their needs are met and if they can\u2019t who\u2019s responsibility is it? Certainly not yours, you don\u2019t owe her anything. Even if she treated you wonderfully and gave you everything - that was her job as a mother when she decided to bring a life into this world, she doesn\u2019t get to turn around and play the victim because of a choice she made. It doesn\u2019t work that way, especially for people like her who think they can treat other people poorly then ask for favors. Nope. I went NC with most of my family because it\u2019s none of their business how I live my life and it\u2019s none of your family\u2019s business how you live your life or how you spend your money or anything!

She\u2019s now fallen on hard times, instead of asking her favourite child (son) to help her she is asking the child she rejected because daughter is financially independent.  OP, let me tell you, blood is not always thicker than water.  Your mother treated you appallingly.  Her reasoning about how much she did for you when you were growing up is laughable.  You didn\u2019t ask to be born, she chose to have kids and it is her responsibility to be the best mother for all her children, which she failed by having a favourite child (your bro) and ignoring you. \n\nShe is an adult, she got herself into this mess, she need to get on her bike or pull up her bootstrap and sort her shit out.

Going with NTA because at any point your brother could have helped (or could still help), and your aunts, and your mom could do something about it too.  \n\nOn the other hand, imagining my mom asking me for money so they wouldn\u2019t lose their house (my mom and I did not have a great relationship when I was growing up)\u2026.If I had some extra, I would help because I would feel guilty about it for some reason. \n\nExamine your feelings- if you would feel guilty, maybe you feel some way about it and you could make a payment to the mortgage company or whatnot.

I\u2019m going to ask you something that will probably never occur to your mom to consider:  what do YOU get out of your relationship and interactions with her?  \n\nWe know what SHE gets - a convenient scapegoat to blame for when bad things happen, and repository for her negative emotions.  And now, most recently, someone she also feels no compunction manipulating and guilt-tripping into becoming her personal ATM.  \n\nBut what do YOU get?  Relationships aren\u2019t supposed to be one-sided, so that\u2019s a completely reasonable thing to ask, even if you\u2019ve been conditioned to believe otherwise.  So what do you get?  And how would giving her money change that?  And if it did, what does it say about her and your relationship that she essentially requires \u201cpayment\u201d from you to make that change?\n\nAlso, if you give her money, even just this once, and even with explicit agreements that it\u2019s \u201cjust this once,\u201d you already know that it won\u2019t be like that, right?  It\u2019ll be like that children\u2019s book \u201cif you give a mouse a cookie.\u201d  This won\u2019t be a one-time ask, and if she feels entitled to $X this month, then she\u2019ll feel just as entitled to $2X next month.  And then $3X the next month, and then $4X and $6X and $12X, etc., etc.  all without a single care about how that affects you or your financial goals and priorities (or your generally well-being).\n\nSo think *very* hard about *ever* agreeing to do this.  It might feel like its relieving a pressure valve in the moment, like it\u2019s worth it to get her off your back.  But any relief would be temporary.  You\u2019d really be opening Pandora\u2019s box.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re looking for how to handle this with your mom (or other family) so that she\u2019ll happily understand and drop it?  Well, you can\u2019t, because she won\u2019t.  She wants money (or in the case of your other family, want mom to stop complaining to them about it, or god forbid, *ask them* for money), and she\u2019s not interested in anyone\u2019s needs/doesn\u2019t consider your wants or needs as valid compared to her own, so there\u2019s no way you can get her to reach a real place of understanding.  \n\nSo her understanding your decisions is not your goal - the goal is for her to *respect your decisions*.  And you do that via establishing boundaries.  There\u2019s loads of advice out there about boundaries, and I\u2019d suggest reading up on it, and maybe even working with a therapist.  \n\nBut for now, I\u2019d start with \u201cMom, the answer is no, and that\u2019s final.  I will not discuss this again.\u201d  And then actually back that up - if the topic of money is brought up again, and I\u2019d count on that happening, then you politely but firmly halt the discussion (use the same \u201cMom, the answer is no, that\u2019s final, and I will not discuss it\u201d) followed by a subject change.  If she won\u2019t drop it, then exit the conversation (hang up, leave the room, mute her phone number, block her on SM, leave the whole house or restaurant - whatever makes it happen).  \n\nAnd do it Every.  Single.  Time.  If you aren\u2019t consistent, she\u2019ll just learn it takes berating you 6 times or 12 times or whatever for her to get what she wants, and she\u2019ll be *relentless forever*.  \n\nAnd yeah, she\u2019s almost certainly going to *hate* you having boundaries (she\u2019s organized her life and your relationship around stomping them, after all), and will throw an enormous tantrum.  Crying, yelling, accusations, bashing you to people, playing the victim, you name it.  But that\u2019s fine, cause *you won\u2019t be there to see it or hear it*.  Because you exited the conversation.  \n\nAnd if she tries to send family to do her bidding for her, it\u2019s essentially the same process.  \u201cThis matter is between my mother and I, and I\u2019m not going to discuss it with anyone else.

You never cared for me, so what do I owe you? I might be projecting haha", "Nta", "NTA. Tell the relatives up your ass that they can support her. Block her number and listen to your dad. He told her no and he was right.", "I\u2019d go full petty. I\u2019ll buy your house from you in good faith. Just put it in my name. Don\u2019t disturb my peace and you can stay there. Treat me like shit and you\u2019re getting evicted.", "You are definitely NTA. I've been waiting for this to happen with my wife who went NC with her mother after years and years of the same shit you went through. Do not give in, you owe her nothing and you deserve everything!", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe her a dime. Tell your brother and those other family members they all can pool in their money together to help your mom out. She\u2019s not your responsibility.", "NTA", "Nta.", "Tell everyone especially your brother, they are more than welcome to give her the money. If they don't want to then tell them to STFU.", "Nta, your mom and brother are turds. Not your responsibility", "YNTA here. From what you said, the mom has treated everyone in her life except her son, badly. If the other members of your family, feel so strongly that she needs support. Let mom move in with them or set up a structured financial plan to help her dig out and pay everyone back. That is their fear most likely, and mom probably wouldn't let them look at her financials anyway. \n\nFinally, she is adult, her son is an adult, time for mom to make adult decisions.", "NTA, start a GoFundMe and forward the link to anyone that complains.", "NTA\n\nAnd in case someone else hasn't already said.. all that \"stuff\" she did for you whilst growing up.. was literally her job as a parent and 'caregiver'.. \nShe was expected to feed, clothe and house you whilst you were a child.. \n\nHolding you to account for that is deplorable..", "How much has your BROTHER given her?  Tell him you will match it.  See what he says.", "NTA. No is a complete sentence. \nYour dad obviously supports your decision, as would anyone else who isn\u2019t a narcissist and knows the situation. It\u2019s stunning how many adults are perpetually shocked that the way they treat others matters in life. \nKeep living your own life, guilt-free, and invest your time and resources into people that actually care about you, and aren\u2019t users. You deserve peace. The people hounding you to give her money will be next in line.", "NTA.\n\nShe can't afford the house she lives in.   Even if you rescue her today, what will happen next year?   It's best that she face the hole she created and let the home go.  She can then move in with her husband and your brother can find his own way.   Save your money.  She has choices and options.  This is not an emergency.  Stop feeling guilty.", "NTA. I\u2019d tell her I will consider giving you money if you explain why I paid rent from 18-20 and brother hasn\u2019t paid from 18-21.\n\nJust to be fair I\u2019d throw some money at her if she gave you an honest answer of \u201cwell I don\u2019t like you\u201d. Then tell her that\u2019s why you only get $200.", "NTA -you know what's what in your own history and no, you're under no obligation to help someone who won't even bother to help herself. Like learning math, and sticking to a budget. Too bad, so sad for her that now she gets to face down the mess SHE made of her life, and the fact that she treated you like shit and YOU REMEMBER that shit.\n\nI'd tell her to go pound sand, but you do what you like because I know when the hounds from hell (family) get involved, things can quickly....disintegrate.", "NTA - Offer to bring her to a financial adviser and attend the appt. with her.    \nThat way you can explain that she has a husband she doesn't live with and a 21 yo son that lives with her but doesn't contribute to household finances (I mean if he's attending school that's a pretty normal set up but I'd think your bio Dad would help out with his expenses not hers).     \n\n\nSomehow you survived the ill treatment - are working hard and doing well and she wants to sponge off you? No! Just no.   \n\n\nThat the 'family' is chiming in to say what do you mean you won't subsidize her? Is just showing their mindset (or that she utterly lied to them about the circumstances).    \n\n\nSomehow you survived the ill-treatment - are working hard and doing well and she wants to sponge off you? No! Just no.  Go No Contact with her.  And stay that way if possible.", "NTA OP and good for you for succeeding in life and being able to run the business and afford things you like/want.  If your personal number isn't tied to the business, I'd seriously start thinking about changing your number and give it to only those who won't share it with your mom/brother/her family.  Best thing you could do is go NC with your mom/brother.", "NTA. Buy her house and charge her rent.", "Nope. nope nope nope nope nope. \n\nI appreciate the context but it's not even necessary. All you need to say is \"My mom is in debt, came to me asking for money. I asked her why she doesn't have her new husband help and she snapped at me and said it's none of my business.\" \n\nYou don't owe her anything. Let her new husband pay for it, or let her lose her house. If she's that short-tempered with you when she's ASKING YOU TO SAVE HER HOUSE, I can't imagine what she was like growing up or how she normally treats people. \n\nAnd if the family gives you trouble, tell them that exact exchange. Tell them you asked why her husband couldn't help and she yelled at you for even asking. \n\nShe's an asshole. Get her out of here!", "NTA block and continue living your best life x", "NTA... You need to tell her that you will not help her because of the way you were raised with obvious favortism. She can get what she needs from her golden child.", ">Even my brother has been telling me how that's so cold that I refuse to help her, because financially I'm in a good place.\n\nIs your brother paying her rent yet? \n\n**NTA**. You don't owe anyone your money, and it might be time to change your LC to NC.", "that's fucking brilliant.", "Haaaaaaaaa.", "NTA.\n\n\u201cMom. Sorry but I didn\u2019t budget for the expenses to help you.

And rather than allow your mother to live her life, your brother is most comfortable with the status quo where he is treated as royalty by her. He new that a stepfather would see the foolishness of that household and demand that it change.  \n\nYou should just tell your brother and everyone else who asks, 'No'. Don't elaborate, don't argue, and don't try to justify. Your no is sufficient. It is an answer and a whole sentence all in one. You don't owe your mother a damn thing. She chose to have children and the two of you were owed being raised simply because she chose to be a mother. At 18, you needed to pay rent. Your brother has now had three years since that magical number to have been given the same opportunity to contribute to the household where he lays his head. You don't live there, you work and have earned your living for yourself. The two of them need to do the same. \n\nLook at it this way, your mother had the audacity to ask your father. He said no. If you were to give her any money that you earn from your father's business, it would be disrespectful to him and yourself. Let go of the guilt and understand that your mother brought this onto herself because of her poor choices in parenting both you and your brother. You're not even close to being the AH here.", "She can't afford her wants, she needs to be more pragmatic.

OP has already chucked her mom overboard, now she just needs to keep her from crawling back into the boat.", "Exactly.  OP owes them nothing. They are greedy selfish people who are using her for her money. If other family members are so worried they can put there own hand in there pocket. The problem is, if you help her out now she would keep on coming back for more handouts. She would never be financially responsible if you enable her and your lazy brother who doesn't even want to contribute to the household. As you quite rightly said, why don't she ask her husband for help, she's his problem.", "Yup, I want a steak dinner. That means I have to go acquire a steak, cook it, and eat it. I can't just expect a steak to magically appear right in front of me.\n\nProbably not the best example, I just really want a steak.", "but wait! You can guilt your adult daughter into buying you a steak! And then once she buys it, guilt her into cooking it for you. And as you eat it in front of her, tell her she sucks at cooking and you don't love her as much as her brother. \n\nAgain not the best example, I just felt like stretching this metaphor.", "That OP is badass."]}
