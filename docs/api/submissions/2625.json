I helped preparing everything, location, food, decorations, all that. The party was a few days ago\n\nHowever, a few hours before the wedding, we (the bridesmaids) were with her for preparation. After some chatting, she pulled me aside and asked me to not wear my sunglasses on her wedding. \n\nFor explaination, I have an eye condition called anisocoria (explained below) and suffer from photophobia (also explained below) in this eye, therefore I always wear sunglasses. \n\nI wanted to know what she expected me to do about my condition and she said I could wear a pretty lace eye patch because that would fit better into the aesthetic of the wedding rather than my glasses or my eyes. I refused because 1. I would've had to go and buy one (I don't think I could've done it on time) and 2. Don't feel comfortable to wear something like that in front of everybody (big wedding). \n\nWe got into an argument and I ended up leaving. In retrospect, I feel like I was being childish about all that, but I wish she would have told me about her issue with my eye before. I don't know if I'm the asshole here so I'll accept any judgement.\n\nHello again. I edited some stuff that's caused some confusion but nothing that changes the narrative of the story. Just clearing up some things that have been worded poorly / mistyped /auto-corrected, sorry, my English is okay but not my first language.\n\nAnisocoria is a condition where you have two different diluted pupils in both eyes. (For me, my left pupil is always extremely diluted while the right one works normal) \n\nPhotophobia is a strong sensitivity to light, which means light like sunlight but also lamps appears very, very bright and even hurts. Some people with his condition also suffer from migraines, that's not the case for me.\n\nPhotophobia isn't always a symptom of anisocoria but can be stronger in combination.

I need more info.", "How does that make OP an asshole as well?", "If you need more information, why don't you just ask? \n\nAfter I refused to wear an eye patch, she asked if I could go without anything then because the wedding didn't take place outside but again I said no, I even wear my sunglasses in evenings when it's almost dark.

With every suggestion she became more aggressive which I understand because she was stressed about the whole wedding thing anyway. \n\nI left when I realized the argument wouldn't end.\n\nTo answer the question you asked above\n\n>if Pam was my best friend I would attend the wedding with the sunglasses on\n\nUntil those few hours before the wedding I thought I would do that too, yes. But as I said in the post, she wouldn't let me.", "I did think NTA initially, but if Pam was my best friend I would attend the wedding with the sunglasses on. Best friend is like a life partner.

NTA OP.", "NTA. If she had told you sooner, you could've potentially found a solution you were both okay with and if not, you at least wouldn't have had to bail right before the wedding.

Had she mentioned it sooner you two may have figured something out. \n\nQuestion since I'm ignorant of your condition, have you never had a situation where this came up, like court or work for example? If so what did you do in those instances?", "NTA this kind of thing needs to be discuss ahead of time, not hours before the event.  It is a medical conditions, it is not by choice.  So horrible for your friend to make you feel shame and guilty.", "NTA. I get that weddings are supposed to be all about the bride but why does courtesy and humanity go out of thr window in so many cases?", "NTA. You are a good friend. She isn\u2019t. Drop her.", "NTA. First of all you have a medical condition. And secondly, I'm honestly getting tired of all of these selfish brides setting conditions on attendance. Ugh.", "Personally I think you'd attract more attention with a eye patch than a pair of sunglasses. \n\nYou have a medical condition. Your sunglasses are a aid to that medical condition. Its like someone asking me morning of the wedding not to wear my glasses and use contacts... like no I can't see without them nor do I have/use contacts, so where am I getting them? Also, are you paying? Cos I won't be.\n\nShe valued aesthetics over you and how it would make you feel. She obviously did it last minute thinking you would cave and magic up a eye patch. She didn't expect you to stand up for yourself and walk out. This girl isn't your friend, or at least not a good one.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, you are NOT the one being childish. And to ask that on such short notice after building her wedding for her - what an appalling way to treat anyone, let alone a friend.", "NTA.\n\nYou have it the other way around - she was selfish and childish.\n\nShe gave you a few hours to change your normal eyewear that you use for a medical condition\u2026for aesthetics?! She can kick rocks. You didn\u2019t suddenly start wearing sunglasses for no reason and she knows you need them. Your reaction was acceptable, even if she\u2019d made this request earlier, she\u2019d have still been an AH imo if it made you uncomfortable.", "It takes time to  plan even the quickest of weddings - she could've figured something out for you well before then. NTA, and as a good friend I cannot believe she'd put you in that position. An eye patch?! SMH.", "NTA \n\nShe told you this a few hours before the wedding. Not a few days not a few weeks but HOURS! Where would you go to even find a lace eye patch? If she was really your friend she would\u2019ve told you weeks ago then offered to help you find it or not gave a fuck about it to begin with. She simply didn\u2019t want you in her wedding because you would mess up her wedding aesthetic.

You are who you are, your body is yours, and this whole thing about friends not fitting the \"aesthetic\" of a wedding is ridiculous.", "NTA. It\u2019s a medical device. Would she ask someone in a wheelchair to walk for her wedding", "NTA \n\nReading between the lines your friend was looking for any excuse to kick you out of the wedding while still getting you to do the work. \n\nAn eye patch would be infinitely more distracting (and weird!) than sunglasses. If yours are dark, she could have asked you to wear rose or gold colored ones \u2014 those are easy enough to find at target. An eye patch is weird, difficult to find and insulting. It\u2019s asking you to leave with plausible deniability (in case she needs another favor.)", "NTA. Would she have told you to not wear glasses if you needed strong glasses to see?\n\nIs it just me, or are bridezillas a large part of this subreddit?", "NTA. She is a buffoon.", "NTA.  In your situation, sunglasses aren\u2019t an accessory, they\u2019re *medical equipment*.  And asking you to remove them for wedding aesthetics (or really any reason) would be like asking you to remove a hearing aid or prosthetic limb or something - *completely* inappropriate.  \n\nYour friend is an asshole.  You did what you had to do.", "NTA. She thinks an eyepatch would be less distracting than sunglasses that could be easily explained? That's ridiculous. Also, if you're impairing your binocular vision with an eyepatch, you might have issues with depth perception, which is just asking for trouble.", "NTA.  If this was an issue for her, she shouldn't have waited until the last minute to bring it up and perhaps something else could have been worked out.", "*ex friend.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou have a medical condition and the bride was being ridiculous. I don\u2019t know what I would have done in your position. I probably would have left too.", "NTA. As someone else said, this is a similar train if though to asking someone to ditch their wheelchair for the wedding.\n\n\nOn a separate note though, you should 100% get an eyepatch!", "NTA. If she had a problem with your sunglasses, the time to deal with that was months before the wedding when she asked you to be a bridesmaid. Not the day of as you're all doing hair/makeup/getting dressed. That's way too late to do anything about the issue. That's put up and shut up time.\n\nI have to wonder how much work you did for the wedding beforehand, and if she asked you in order to get your free labor before chucking you the day of when there was no more work for you to do. But even if this is not the case, what the bride did on her wedding day isn't the act of a friend.", "NTA but how did your \u201cbest friend\u201d not know of your eye condition until right before the wedding?", "As someone who has been diagnosed with photophobia, I can say from experience that not everyone believes extreme light sensitivity is a legitimate issue, even considering all the side affects that can occur after exposure. \n\nNTA. I'm sorry your \"friend\" sucks. How is an eye patch less conspicuous than sunglasses?", "NTA she didn't want you there, she just wanted you to help make it happen", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nWhat is WITH bride's today and all of their stupid,  micro-managing, bridezilla requests on wedding days? \n\nWho cares if you have on sunglasses. I keep reading about more and more of these scenarios of the brides having all of these \"special requests\" of everyone coming to the wedding. \n\nTheir focus should be on their mate and getting married to the mate and starting their life together.....not if anyone attending the wedding had the audacity to wear brown shoes, or any women had a blue jacket or whatever other insane obsessions they are trying to regulate.", "NTA. She asked you this hours before. There is no way you could have met her request. Lace eye patches are not something that are readily available in most places.", "NTA\n\nIf my best friend had you're condition I'd be trying to make her life less difficult not more. Wedding or no wedding.", "NTA.\n\nYou have a medical condition that you can't help, and she threw you a massive curveball just hours before the wedding. That is 100% unreasonable of her. A necessary medical accommodation takes precedence over an aesthetic.", "NTA  She expected you to half blind yourself to attend her wedding?  That's ridiculous.  \n\nInteresting that the anisocoria makes your eye photosensitive.  My son has it in one eye, but he's never mentioned that.  It is his significantly weaker eye though, so maybe he has never noticed.", "NTA. I had an eye condition (thankfully resolved) where I had intense photosensitivity and could barely leave the house.

Someone must have said something \u2026.", "NTA.  \n\nI wouldn't care if my friend suddenly sprouted horns and grew tentacles,  I want to share a happy moment.  Not stage a photo shoot.", "You have a medical need to wear that. NTA. She's TA. It would be different if you simply enjoyed wearing sunglasses but this isn't that.

How does this friend think a funky eye patch is a better aesthetic than sunglasses? I'm wondering if there's something else at play here. Is OP an especially attractive person, much more so than the bride?

She is as ridiculous as they come.", "NTA I have photophobia and there are days I can't look out the window and sunglasses would be the best option.

Second, this isn't a conversation for a few hours before her wedding. If this was a concern for her, it was something she should have brought up before hand. Undoubtedly she thought that well, she was the bride so you'd give in to her because who says no to the bride on her wedding day. \n\neven the eye patch thing was a throw away because at that point there was no way to accomplish it. she didn't just say 'an eye patch' which you might have been able to get at a local pharmacy but it had to be a lace eye patch. really?", "Not childish on your part by any means!

Since you have to wear sunglasses all the time, do you own stylish pairs or just go utilitarian? \n\nYou seem to even hesitate at knowing your friend is a dick, it makes me wonder if you ever blend your style in with your sunglasses so you can feel like you look good as is, not despite your disability.", "I learned new words today, thank you!\n\n\nMy eyes are very light sensitive and I get migraines a lot, so my glasses have a little tint, and in a bad migraine I wear darker glasses. So to an extent I feel your pain. \n\n\nAnyway, NTA. She should have said something _much_ earlier. I still feel like it's an unreasonable ask, but it would at least have been better if you had a chance to address it earlier.", "NTA OP. They are medically necessary. Your \"best friend\" values aesthetics more than you. Time to re-evaluate the relationship.", "NTA\n\nShe's an ableist AH", "She's well aware of your condition and suddenly has an issue with it??? If she had said something awhile ago you probably could have worked something out, but at this point ??? NOPE. Nta", "Nta, couldn't she have told yout before the the day of the wedding?", "She didn't want you there. She wanted you to put all this effort into the wedding then she found an excuse so you could t be there. Please drop this \"friend\". NTA", "NTA. Nothing wrong with advocating for yourself.", "from the bottom of my heart:\n\nyour best friend sucks major balls. i hope you will meet better people. \n\nNTA", "NTA but your bridezilla friend is", "NTA, if she cared so much about that she should've brought it up days or weeks before the wedding so something could be figured out that would for everyone.", "Mere *hours* before the wedding, she pulls you aside and asks you to wear something different that you don't own? \n\n> *OP, my aesthetic doesn't include your crutches, but since I know your leg is broken and you need something, would you be able to go out and buy something like a beautiful ivory cane? Anytime in the next two-ish hours would work :) No? You're more comfortable with the crutches? Ugh, asshole.* \n\nNTA", "NTA I also have photophobia (ugh hate the name, I\u2019m not scared of light \ud83d\ude02) and I\u2019m crippled without sunglasses.", "NTA,\n\nSo for your disability you wanted to wear shades (which... should be fine?) and decided you should wear an eyepatch?! I'm so confused by your friend. I'm scared for any friends or family that have more visible disabilities. I know some people get tunnel vision for weddings but this... yeah you're fine. I have do idea what's going on with your friend.", "NTA. What kind of friend says, \"Yeah yeah, I know you have a disability, but can't you dress it up so it looks better for my wedding?\"\n\nYour friend owes you a major apology. Don't let her guilt trip you into apologizing to her.", "NTA. No way in HELL are you the asshole for not placating to your friend's insane request. She could have really done something cool with finding unique sunglasses for you to wear. \n\nThe thing is, she knows this about you. It's not some secret that came up all of a sudden. I can't stand seeing these stories about brides making the most ridiculous requests these days because it's ThEiR DaY.", "NTA!! Are you kidding me with this story? People are getting absolutely ridiculous regarding wedding demands. Would she have asked you to take off an arm or leg cast because it ruins the aesthetics of the wedding pictures? How about removing a wig because you have alopecia!? Or your blood sugar level monitoring system? Good grief. How petty and stupid is this woman. Get a new best friend. Again, NTA", "Fuck her. NTA.", "Absolutely NTA.", "Yes, I agree completely. Sorry for your nutty friend op.", "The wheelchair just doesn\u2019t fit the aesthetics", "I get the feeling the bride wanted the help with the wedding but not OP there. This is probably what the bride wanted. NTA", "You could use a pretty lace palanquin because that would fit better into the aesthetic of the wedding rather than your wheelchair or your impeded mobility. \ud83d\ude0a", "?\n\nWhere lol", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

The ladies love him and I can't think of anyone that would tell him not to wear his glasses.", "I want to give you a big virtual hug.", "Look at Axon Optics online. They make specialty sunglasses and contacts for people with migraines and other disabilities.", ">\"hey sorry, do something else.\".\n\nWorse... more like \"he, do that fancy pirate thing in front of many many strangers...\"", "An eye patch, even if pretty and lacy, will definitely have  drawn more attention away from the bride than a pair of sunglasses. Because human nature would be speculating how you lost your eye and why you were trying to rock a pirate look. But, if you said ahead of time you\u2019d wear a lacy eyepatch, she\u2019d still have pulled you aside and asked you to do something ridiculous at the last moment, and you still would have dropped out. I\u2019m sorry you had such an awful \u201c friend\u201d", "This was my thought! \"Oh sorry lemme just pop down to the pharmacy and get a 5 pack\". Is the best friend okay like??", "Yeah, my feeling is that the (hopefully now former) friend didn't actually want OP to wear a pretty lace eye patch, her plan was to make a request that OP couldn't fulfill in the time frame given as a means to get the friend's real desired outcome, OP not covering her eye at all and suffering through for the aesthetic.", "Oh you lucky lady!  Those Bowie eyes so had me crushing & my first concert at 17.  Crush continued his whole life.", "I'm in my early 40's SAME", "why on earth are you putting blame on YOU!!!!!!!!!! She is an AH she could have talked to you months ago if it bothered her that much not last min and she knows you condition so she knows you are not doing it to annoy ppl or be the extra attention seeker . She is to blame for it all. She could have talked to you and not push you in a corner where your only way out was not to be in the wedding pictures . maybe she planned it and wanted you to leave so she didn't have to have pics with the \"weird \" braidmaid I mean sure it may cause a bit of attention but a patch looks worse .She knows you for years so she should be used of ppl staring if you wear sunglasses indoors but she could stand by your side and tell them off. It shouldn't bother her . if it did she shouldn't make you her braidmaid", "SHE has to work on not being an ableist and an AH and a user and an abuser. You have NOTHING to apologize for and are NTA!!! You sound like a lovely person. Own those beautiful eyes, girl!!!!", "You just pop down to the shops! There's \"The EyePatch Hut\" thats on Third. There's \"Eye Patches R Us\" that's on Third too. You got \"Put Your Eye Here\" that's on Third. \n\nMatter of fact they're all in the same complex, it's the Eye Patch Complex down on Third.", "RIGHT?!?! Like how is a freaking eye patch (no matter how \u201con brand\u201d for the wedding) LESS attention grabbing than sunglasses. The suggestion is WILD!", "Ikr i cant wait for her to have kids and find out they dont always \u201cfit the aesthetic\u201d either. Fuck aesthetic, let people be.", "Oh, the eyepatch district.", "Lol", "That's right!"]}
