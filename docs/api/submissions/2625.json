I need more info.", "How does that make OP an asshole as well?", "If you need more information, why don't you just ask? \n\nAfter I refused to wear an eye patch, she asked if I could go without anything then because the wedding didn't take place outside but again I said no, I even wear my sunglasses in evenings when it's almost dark. She came up with more ideas like me standing behind others so they cover the light for me. With every suggestion she became more aggressive which I understand because she was stressed about the whole wedding thing anyway. \n\nI left when I realized the argument wouldn't end.\n\nTo answer the question you asked above\n\n>if Pam was my best friend I would attend the wedding with the sunglasses on\n\nUntil those few hours before the wedding I thought I would do that too, yes. But as I said in the post, she wouldn't let me.", "I did think NTA initially, but if Pam was my best friend I would attend the wedding with the sunglasses on. Best friend is like a life partner.

NTA OP.", "NTA. If she had told you sooner, you could've potentially found a solution you were both okay with and if not, you at least wouldn't have had to bail right before the wedding.

Had she mentioned it sooner you two may have figured something out. \n\nQuestion since I'm ignorant of your condition, have you never had a situation where this came up, like court or work for example? If so what did you do in those instances?", "NTA this kind of thing needs to be discuss ahead of time, not hours before the event.  It is a medical conditions, it is not by choice.  So horrible for your friend to make you feel shame and guilty.", "NTA. I get that weddings are supposed to be all about the bride but why does courtesy and humanity go out of thr window in so many cases?", "NTA. You are a good friend. She isn\u2019t. Drop her.", "NTA. First of all you have a medical condition. And secondly, I'm honestly getting tired of all of these selfish brides setting conditions on attendance. Ugh.", "Personally I think you'd attract more attention with a eye patch than a pair of sunglasses. \n\nYou have a medical condition. Your sunglasses are a aid to that medical condition. Its like someone asking me morning of the wedding not to wear my glasses and use contacts... like no I can't see without them nor do I have/use contacts, so where am I getting them? Also, are you paying? Cos I won't be.\n\nShe valued aesthetics over you and how it would make you feel. She obviously did it last minute thinking you would cave and magic up a eye patch. She didn't expect you to stand up for yourself and walk out. This girl isn't your friend, or at least not a good one.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, you are NOT the one being childish. And to ask that on such short notice after building her wedding for her - what an appalling way to treat anyone, let alone a friend.", "NTA.\n\nYou have it the other way around - she was selfish and childish.\n\nShe gave you a few hours to change your normal eyewear that you use for a medical condition\u2026for aesthetics?! She can kick rocks. You didn\u2019t suddenly start wearing sunglasses for no reason and she knows you need them. Your reaction was acceptable, even if she\u2019d made this request earlier, she\u2019d have still been an AH imo if it made you uncomfortable.", "It takes time to  plan even the quickest of weddings - she could've figured something out for you well before then. NTA, and as a good friend I cannot believe she'd put you in that position. An eye patch?! SMH.", "NTA \n\nShe told you this a few hours before the wedding. Not a few days not a few weeks but HOURS! Where would you go to even find a lace eye patch? If she was really your friend she would\u2019ve told you weeks ago then offered to help you find it or not gave a fuck about it to begin with. She simply didn\u2019t want you in her wedding because you would mess up her wedding aesthetic. It\u2019s messed up because honestly who cares wedding should be about celebrating the love and unity of the couple all that other crap doesn\u2019t matter in the end.", "NTA", "NTA   Does she have problems with people who wear regular eyeglasses too? You are who you are, your body is yours, and this whole thing about friends not fitting the \"aesthetic\" of a wedding is ridiculous.", "NTA. It\u2019s a medical device. Would she ask someone in a wheelchair to walk for her wedding", "NTA \n\nReading between the lines your friend was looking for any excuse to kick you out of the wedding while still getting you to do the work. \n\nAn eye patch would be infinitely more distracting (and weird!) than sunglasses. If yours are dark, she could have asked you to wear rose or gold colored ones \u2014 those are easy enough to find at target. An eye patch is weird, difficult to find and insulting. It\u2019s asking you to leave with plausible deniability (in case she needs another favor.)", "NTA. Would she have told you to not wear glasses if you needed strong glasses to see?\n\nIs it just me, or are bridezillas a large part of this subreddit?", "NTA. She is a buffoon.", "NTA.  In your situation, sunglasses aren\u2019t an accessory, they\u2019re *medical equipment*.  And asking you to remove them for wedding aesthetics (or really any reason) would be like asking you to remove a hearing aid or prosthetic limb or something - *completely* inappropriate.  \n\nYour friend is an asshole.  You did what you had to do.", "NTA. She thinks an eyepatch would be less distracting than sunglasses that could be easily explained? That's ridiculous. Also, if you're impairing your binocular vision with an eyepatch, you might have issues with depth perception, which is just asking for trouble.", "NTA.  If this was an issue for her, she shouldn't have waited until the last minute to bring it up and perhaps something else could have been worked out.", "*ex friend.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou have a medical condition and the bride was being ridiculous. I don\u2019t know what I would have done in your position. I probably would have left too.", "NTA. As someone else said, this is a similar train if though to asking someone to ditch their wheelchair for the wedding.\n\n\nOn a separate note though, you should 100% get an eyepatch!", "NTA. If she had a problem with your sunglasses, the time to deal with that was months before the wedding when she asked you to be a bridesmaid. Not the day of as you're all doing hair/makeup/getting dressed. That's way too late to do anything about the issue. That's put up and shut up time.\n\nI have to wonder how much work you did for the wedding beforehand, and if she asked you in order to get your free labor before chucking you the day of when there was no more work for you to do. But even if this is not the case, what the bride did on her wedding day isn't the act of a friend.", "NTA but how did your \u201cbest friend\u201d not know of your eye condition until right before the wedding?", "As someone who has been diagnosed with photophobia, I can say from experience that not everyone believes extreme light sensitivity is a legitimate issue, even considering all the side affects that can occur after exposure. \n\nNTA. I'm sorry your \"friend\" sucks. How is an eye patch less conspicuous than sunglasses?", "NTA she didn't want you there, she just wanted you to help make it happen", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nWhat is WITH bride's today and all of their stupid,  micro-managing, bridezilla requests on wedding days? \n\nWho cares if you have on sunglasses. I keep reading about more and more of these scenarios of the brides having all of these \"special requests\" of everyone coming to the wedding. \n\nTheir focus should be on their mate and getting married to the mate and starting their life together.....not if anyone attending the wedding had the audacity to wear brown shoes, or any women had a blue jacket or whatever other insane obsessions they are trying to regulate.", "NTA. She asked you this hours before. There is no way you could have met her request. Lace eye patches are not something that are readily available in most places.", "NTA\n\nIf my best friend had you're condition I'd be trying to make her life less difficult not more. Wedding or no wedding.", "NTA.\n\nYou have a medical condition that you can't help, and she threw you a massive curveball just hours before the wedding. That is 100% unreasonable of her. A necessary medical accommodation takes precedence over an aesthetic.", "NTA  She expected you to half blind yourself to attend her wedding?  That's ridiculous.  \n\nInteresting that the anisocoria makes your eye photosensitive.  My son has it in one eye, but he's never mentioned that.  It is his significantly weaker eye though, so maybe he has never noticed.", "NTA. I had an eye condition (thankfully resolved) where I had intense photosensitivity and could barely leave the house. I made it to a friend's outdoor wedding using the biggest, chunkiest, darkest wraparound sunglasses I could find. \n\nEveryone was really nice about it and were thrilled I was there. Because they were normal fucking human beings.", "I like to wear an eye patch but that's just me.  You do you.  She has no right to dictate what makes you comfortable.\n\nEditted\n\nOops. I forgot.

I\u2019m sorry this person turned out to be a lousy friend but now you know.", "NTA \n\nWhat a terrible demand to make! \nThe more I read your comments, the angrier I get at your \u201cbest friend\u201d. Asking you to stand behind people and be in pain without your sunglasses. I can\u2019t believe she decided to hyper focus on your sunglasses literally hours before the wedding. Someone must have said something \u2026.", "NTA.  \n\nI wouldn't care if my friend suddenly sprouted horns and grew tentacles,  I want to share a happy moment.  Not stage a photo shoot.", "You have a medical need to wear that. NTA. She's TA. It would be different if you simply enjoyed wearing sunglasses but this isn't that. Would she require others who need accessibility aids to change those out too? See how gross that sounds?", "NTA.\n\n>  that would fit better into the aesthetic of the wedding\n\nUpon hearing 'You're not pretty enough to attend,' it's never inappropriate to say 'Ok, have fun, I'm out.'", "NTA This is weird. How does this friend think a funky eye patch is a better aesthetic than sunglasses? I'm wondering if there's something else at play here. Is OP an especially attractive person, much more so than the bride? Was the bride trying to downgrade her appearance?", "NTA. \n\nYou literally have a disability and she told you not to bring the thing that aids your disability, after you helped her plan the whole thing. I wouldn't have gone either.", "I\u2019m confused as to how you were invited a few days ago, you\u2019re a bridesmaid, and the wedding has already happened.\n\nHow long have you known this person?", "NTA. She is as ridiculous as they come.", "NTA I have photophobia and there are days I can't look out the window and sunglasses would be the best option. If you wore that eye patch it would've been so painful readjusting it to light. She should have told you before, or like an actual friend, not said anything.", "NTA First of all, f- your friend. Second, this isn't a conversation for a few hours before her wedding. If this was a concern for her, it was something she should have brought up before hand. Undoubtedly she thought that well, she was the bride so you'd give in to her because who says no to the bride on her wedding day. \n\neven the eye patch thing was a throw away because at that point there was no way to accomplish it. she didn't just say 'an eye patch' which you might have been able to get at a local pharmacy but it had to be a lace eye patch. really?", "Not childish on your part by any means!  Your sunglasses are a medical device. I wear sunglasses in some stores because the lights/reflection cause me to get dizzy.  Your glasses are medically necessary, and it is extremely rude and selfish of your \u201cfriend\u201d. NTA!!", "NTA. She is putting the her wedding aesthetic ahead of your health. She didn't tell you in advance because she was trying to put you on the spot hoping you would feel obligated to acquiesce to her crappy demand.", "Nta and does she really think *an eyepatch* is going to be noticeable than sunglasses??????", "NTA.  She could have mentioned it earlier and you could have declined before the last minute.

We had 3 people in walking boots at our wedding because of various injuries, including one that had just been injured the week before.

My husband\u2019s cousin who was the one injured the week before (hit by a car) was in a boot and a wheelchair at the time. She\u2019s still in the pictures. Our brother in law was in a boot from being hit by a car 6 months prior he\u2019s still in our photos. My husband has a lazy eye I\u2019m sure if I look hard enough there are candid photos where his eye isn\u2019t focused. Doesn\u2019t ruin a thing. Your friend knew about your condition and should have known when she asked you would need to wear sunglasses. If she had an issue it should have been addressed a long time ago and way before the day of the wedding so you could have a discussion about it.
