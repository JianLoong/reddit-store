After some chatting, she pulled me aside and asked me to not wear my sunglasses on her wedding. \n\nFor explaination, I have an eye condition called aniscora (my left pupil is always extremely diluted while the right one works normal) and suffer from photophobia in this eye, therefore I always wear sunglasses. \n\nI wanted to know what she expected me to do about my condition and she said I could wear a pretty lace eye patch because that would fit better into the aesthetic of the wedding rather than my glasses or my eyes. I refused because 1. I would've had to go and buy one (I don't think I could've done it on time) and 2. Don't feel comfortable to wear something like that in front of everybody (big wedding). \n\nWe got into an argument and I ended up leaving. In retrospect, I feel like I was being childish about all that, but I wish she would have told me about her issue with my eye before.

Your best friend is the real AH.", "NTA. She ask you last minute, there was nothing to be done now. Maybe if she would have said it earlier you would have been able to get a compromise, like a sunglass that fits the \"aesthetic\". But in the end a condition is more important than aesthetic.\n\nLeaving might have been a bit over the top but nothing that would make you an asshole.", "NTA  \nAs a long time friend I'm sure she was aware of your condition and should have realised how uncomfortable you would be. Looks like she waited up to the last minute to force you into a decision.", "NTA. If this was a concern for her she should have brought it up a whole lot sooner. Not saying it\u2019s ok for her to ask this, but waiting until the last minute to mention it she really left you with no choice. There\u2019s no way you\u2019d have been able to acquire one that quickly, unless there\u2019s an abundance of lace eye patch stores in your area.", "NTA. It\u2019s not just about looks, it\u2019s actual *pain* when you have a condition like that. Too bad your \u201cfriend\u201d (*news flash: she\u2019s not*) feels your disability offends her \u201caesthetic.\u201d", "NTA. This is for a medical condition that you can't help. It would be a different story if you just wore them for aesthetic purposes, and not a medical condition. Your friend is 100% in the wrong.", "NTA\n\nYou have a medical condition that makes it very uncomfortable for you in the light and she\u2019s expecting you to either run out and get an eye patch (which would be more distracting in photos than sun glasses imo) or to suffer through physical discomfort just to preserve the aesthetic that she\u2019s going for. Would she ask someone with a broken foot to walk without their cast or boot??\n\nThat is a completely unreasonable demand and she had the whole run up to the wedding to discuss this and she waited until just hours before the ceremony in the hopes of pressuring you to give in to her demand. \n\nThe childish and selfish one here is the bride.", "NTA \n\nEven if you could look past the sheer outrageousness of her request (which I can\u2019t because\u2026 WOW), why would she wait until a few hours before the wedding to raise it?\n\nSounds like she wanted a helper but didn\u2019t really want you as a bridesmaid and pulled some bullshit excuse out her ass at the last minute.\n\nIt\u2019s not like your medical condition is a surprise.", "Okay let me get this straight.\n\nYou have an eye condition that you can't help and it's painful for you to not wear sunglasses because of the light. Yet your best friends thinks her aesthetic is more important on her wedding than your well-being?\n\nThat's beyond f*cked up. Especially this comment:\n\n> because that would fit better into the aesthetic of the wedding rather than my glasses or my eyes.\n\nAm eye patch is better than your eyes? Because they don't look the same? Holy shit. Are there only blue eyes people allowed or something? Your friend isn't your friend.\n\nNTA", "NTA\nIt's like saying \"Please come without your wheelchair.\"\n\nIt's sad you missed your friends wedding. I hope you will get an apology for this behavior.", "NTA. If she had an issue with it, she could have told you more than a *few hours* before the wedding.", "NTA. You literally wear them for a medical reason. She is a major AH for asking you not to.", "NTA. Your not-going due to her last-minute request seems like a reasonable response. You could not accommodate her and you did not want to ruin the aesthetic of the event. Sounds like a won-win to me.", "NTA. Your glasses are a medical device given how you use them. Also, eye patches and sunglasses aren\u2019t the same - if you\u2019re not used to a patch it\u2019s gonna mess w your depth perception and then her pics could get really interesting.", "NTA, and I\u2019m honestly having trouble believing you\u2019re in doubt on that score.  You have a disability.  She wanted to take away your accommodation because it was \u201cruining\u201d her aesthetic.  Do you really think that makes you the asshole?  Especially when, if she *was* determined to make this an issue, she could\u2019ve brought it up and at least given you a chance to skip out *well* before the event, let alone doing all this shit for free?", "NTA\n\nNobody's wedding \"*aesthetic*\" trumps someone's diagnosed medical condition.\n\nThe wedding is one day in her life, your aniscora is a lifetime in yours. \n\nI'd say..... this is no friend. She asked, you said no, she kept persisting. Unless she apologizes from the bottom of her heart and repents fully - this is the end of the friendship. You deserve better friends.", "NTA... But as an aside... I have photophobia and finally got sports contacts a few years ago. Absolute game changer! But I do have dark eyes, which makes them less noticeable.", "ESH. I dont understand peoples need to control others on their wedding day. It\u2019s just nok ok!! I understand that you left. Maybe a bit childish, but she was behaving badly and I understand you reaction. But is she truly your best friend? This is not what best friends do. This does not make any sense to me. You both behaved badly.", "NTA What kind of best friend is she if she doesn\u2019t know you can\u2019t live without sunglasses? Imagine telling a leg cripple can\u2019t bring their wheelchair cause doesn\u2019t look nice in picture.", "Well! You don't get to act childishly when confronting a bridezilla.\n\nOh. Wait. Yes. Yes, you do.\n\nNTA.\n\nEven disregarding the other issues, if you couldn't buy the eye patch in time, that kinda scotches the whole deal, doesn't it?", "NTA you have a disability, it\u2019s not a fashion statement", "Hello, thank you for the answer\n\nI'm used to people not being comfortable with my eyes because of the difference between them. It does not fit into the standard of beauty in their mind but many react like this I don't have an issue with that anymore", "Hey, thanks for the answer!\n\nQuick question, where did you get those contacts from? I checked a few opticians and they don't have them here and I made bad experiences with the ones from online shopping", "If it was a regular friend or and acquaintance I would say NTA, but she is four best friend you claim. Does that mean nothing?", ">Even disregarding the other issues, if you couldn't buy the eye patch in time, that kinda scotches the whole deal, doesn't it?\n\nPretty much. I don't know what would have happened if I went to buy one and didn't get back on time but I still feel bad for leaving her wedding because we've known each other for so long and always dreamed of being each other's bridesmaid", "A real best friend wouldn\u2019t make ridiculous demands over how their friend manages a medical condition they should be *well* aware needs to be managed the way it\u2019s being managed.", "You said \"this is not what best friends do,\" but a good best friend would have at the very least brought this up before the DAY OF the wedding. What was OP supposed to do?", "That is why this does not make sense at all. Are they really best friends?", "I don\u2019t understand how this person is OPs best friend, and I will never understand why people make demands about what other people wear or look like at their weddings. \nI also feel like some information is missing. \nPam said please wear eye patch. OP said that will be not be possible for me. And bam she is not attending wedding and they did not discuss further? I need more info.", "How does that make OP an asshole as well?", "If you need more information, why don't you just ask? \n\nAfter I refused to wear an eye patch, she asked if I could go without anything then because the wedding didn't take place outside but again I said no, I even wear my sunglasses in evenings when it's almost dark. She came up with more ideas like me standing behind others so they cover the light for me. With every suggestion she became more aggressive which I understand because she was stressed about the whole wedding thing anyway. \n\nI left when I realized the argument wouldn't end.\n\nTo answer the question you asked above\n\n>if Pam was my best friend I would attend the wedding with the sunglasses on\n\nUntil those few hours before the wedding I thought I would do that too, yes. But as I said in the post, she wouldn't let me.", "I did think NTA initially, but if Pam was my best friend I would attend the wedding with the sunglasses on. Best friend is like a life partner. You just don\u2019t get up and leave when it\u2019s hard. But I feel we are missing some details here."]}
