{"id": 307, "submission_id": "yiog1d", "title": "AITA for being upset with my dad for moving on", "selftext": "Considering my age (17f) I try to practice empathy more than most. I\u2019m just having a hard time not being mad at my dad. For context, my mom passed a year ago which left my dad (50) to finish raising my sister and I. My sister is older   but still lives at home and I am moving out this summer for college. After my mom, my dad maintained he\u2019d never remarry because my mom and him would\u2019ve made it to old age if it wasn\u2019t for what happened. My sister and I never asked for this promise. Right after the year anniversary of her passing, he informs us he is going out with his boss. It took us by shock, me more so than my sister. I haven\u2019t been able to even say the words [my mom died] and now the same woman who gave me a book about grieving at my mothers funeral is banging my dad? sorry? It just feels like i\u2019m in a dark timeline of reality. My sister accepted it pretty fast but it\u2019s been a month and it\u2019s still eating me up. In my head my mom never stopped being my dads wife after she passed and it feels like my dad just ended their marriage for someone he knew while my mom was alive. I know it isn\u2019t fair of me to expect him to never move on, nor do I want that, but it just seems too soon. I really wished he waited for me to move out. Whenever he goes out with her he never texts my sister and I back (VERY out of character for him) and will say he\u2019s going out with a friend if he has plans with her. I know he is trying to spare my feelings, but it feels like i\u2019m watching my dad cheat on my mom. He\u2019s an incredible dad, really, but I sorta feel he could\u2019ve been a better husband. I was always closer with my mom and she\u2019d tell me everything\u2026I know how much she adores him and I know that if the roles were reversed, she wouldn\u2019t be looking for someone else to fill the void. It\u2019s hard guys, seeing sexually explicit texts about her, him taking another woman on the same dates he took my mom, and god the fact she likes red wine like my mom, it kills me. I have nothing against this lovely woman who is occupying my dads time and taking his mind off of the loss, but i never want to meet/engage with her in any kind of way (even tho i know he wants me to). One of his drunk friends mentioned to me that my dad said he wishes i would come around her, and it\u2019s really gotten to me. This expectation of me being okay with seeing my dad with a girlfriend ONLY A YEAR after seeing him happy with my mom. You know how short a year is? I think i\u2019m angry but I won\u2019t let myself direct it at anyone because I love my dad to pieces and don\u2019t want to spend my last months of living with him wasting it by being upset with him. But i cant talk with him  about how i feel because i know this is a very delicate situation and i don\u2019t want to instill guilt in him. But I haven\u2019t seen much from him to show he\u2019s guilty at all, i\u2019ve even caught him comparing my mom and this woman. It just makes me sick whenever he says her name, it\u2019s just so soon and I miss my mom. I cant go replace the void left by her, even if i wanted to, and it almost feels unfair that he is and moving on. A grieving part of me never stopped believing my mom is gonna come home. Obviously my process is behind other family members but my dad really moved on before i even accepted reality. I feel a lot guilt for not being okay with it since everyone else is, but i was always my mom\u2019s person. it doesn\u2019t feel fair of him to make me wrestle with this while he is having fun gallivanting with his boss. i guess that\u2019s a selfish way of looking at it though. god i wish he waited till summer.", "created_utc": 1667249189, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiog1d/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_dad_for_moving_on/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
