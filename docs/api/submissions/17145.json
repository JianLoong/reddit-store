Would like to know where OP lives, if it is a forever kind of deal and how much vacation time parents get per year (or if they are retired and always free) and of course if they will be grandparent-sitting all the time. All that said- it would hurt my feelings if my family vacationed without me presumably because \u201cthey couldn\u2019t just wait until I could come after I had the baby.\u201d (But let\u2019s be real that is like probably at least 6 months from now, right, baby life is crazy from what I hear.
