And everyone gets along with him?! The nerve of that guy!

I'm usually pretty skeptical of \"Well this behavior walks right up to the line of homophobia without saying it directly so we'll assume it's not,\" but there doesn't seem to be anything you've described that's actually related to your sexuality.\n\nA tactical, rather than moral, thing to consider: accusations of bigotry are pretty much universally a conversation ender.  If they're actually a racist/homophobe/etc, they're not going to have a defense for it, so the conversation ends.  If they're not, but you've decided they are anyway, it's going to be very difficult to persuade you otherwise, so people aren't going to try, and whatever the actual issue is will never be understood or resolved.  This is all fine if they're an actual bigot (who should be called out) or someone you don't care about not continuing to talk to.  If you want to still be friends with Jason though, you need to apologize for the accusation and get to the bottom of the actual issue.  If he elaborates and it's clear it's actually homophobia, then call it quits.  \n\nI'd try to avoid jumping directly from there to the \"He must just be secretly in love with me.\"  Reddit is full of messy people who love drama they're not impacted by, so they're gonna assume the most dramatic alternative.", "The two of you are both assholes in my opinion.\nI think if your friend was truly homophobic then he would treat you badly as well (or he would cut you off completely), not just your boyfriend, so I think you are an asshole for calling him homophobic.

I think it would have been fair to give him the benefit of the doubt about his dislike and have a proper conversation, rather than accuse him of being a homophobe.", "NTA, your friend\u2019s reaction seems rooted in homophobia. Some people will claim not to be homophobic but then have an issue if a person they\u2019re close with comes out.", "people can have reasons to dislike a person that has nothing to do with sexuality, light YTA for automatically assuming it's homophobia and your sister is right.

One of my old housemates had a bf that made my skin crawl, they were a straight couple but if they had been a gay couple I'm sure she could have wrongly accused me of the same (well, not really since I'm bi, but you get the idea).\n\nSome people just don't get along. It doesn't always mean something deeper. To flat out accuse your friend like this is an insult to all the times he has supported you in your sexuality.\n\nHe was wrong for trying not to have your own boyfriend at your birthday party, though.

And honestly, accepting that you won\u2019t always resist, and knowing how to do damage control when you slip. \n\nIf he also values your friendship, I\u2019d kinda both apologize and demand answers. Ultimatogize. Say you\u2019re sorry for assuming it was homophobia, but you can\u2019t keep having him act this way. Either he needs a more specific explanation for his actions, he needs to suck it up and learn to tolerate Chris, or he needs to accept that you can\u2019t be friends.

He does seem jealous, and I\u2019m not implying a romantic way. He was your friend, you live together, now another guy is taking his place and he can be feeling\u2026 displaced. As this is a guy you are dating, and he seems a nice guy, he could feel a little jealous over friendship and not necessarily in a romantic way, as some have said.", "Is it possible he is jealous as time is now not spent as much with him as your new boyfriend?", "NTA. Jason fancies you.", "YTA because you seem to think people\u2019s behavior towards you now centers around your sexuality. You had no problem pulling the homophobe card at the first instance your friend acted out of character because he doesn\u2019t like your current partner.

Maybe it is homophobia, which makes him extra asshole-ish. But I'd like to present a different reason (where he still sucks). He's jealous that you have someone else, regardless of romance. Reading this made me think of my best friend. My best friend has another best friend. We've all known each other for a very, very long time. We are all hetero, all in long term relationships. But other best friend doesn't like me. She pretends to when we are together in a large group. But she's actually rude, stand offish, doesn't want me included in things.

We all know why we don\u2019t like someone, no matter how petty those reasons might be.  IMO Jason has a problem with your boyfriend because that relationship takes him away from the relationship that you two have.  Jason has his girlfriend and still had his single friend\u2026.you.  Now his best friend isn\u2019t single anymore and he doesn\u2019t like it.  Here\u2019s a simple question to ask Jason.  \u201cJason, what kind of guy would YOU like to see me with?\u201d  His response will answer most of your questions.", "Seems like you two are close, is it possible he is jealous, not because he is into you but because he sees it as losing his friend? He was not like this with your previous gf but that may have been because those relationships were not as serious or because he still felt there were \"guy\" things that was still exclusively yours. It may not even be a conscious thing for him. Try talking again but know he is being a d*ck about it no matter the reason and you are NTA."]}
