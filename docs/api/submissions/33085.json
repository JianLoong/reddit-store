I\u2019ve been with my fianc\u00e9e(28) for 7 years, and we currently don\u2019t have any kids. We do plan on trying in the next year or so. My fianc\u00e9e just graduated from her RN program so a lots been on hold since she was in school. \n\nRecently, me and my 2 younger siblings had to put our mother in a nursing home because of Alzheimer\u2019s. Both my siblings, and nephew has lived with with my mom all their lives. My 26yo brother has severe autism and anxiety, while my sister (22) is a young mom to a 4 year old who\u2019s been hopping jobs needing my moms support. Their dad, (who\u2019s not my dad) lives states away and hasn\u2019t offered to help or take them in during this time. Which leaves me (as the oldest sibling) to fix things. While my fianc\u00e9e is aware of everything that\u2019s going on, before we even starting talking about arrangements she told me \u201cdon\u2019t even think about moving everyone in here.\u201d\n\nI told her she needs to consider what my family is going through, and she seemed to have no empathy. She started throwing out how my sister has always been co-dependent on my mom with her kid and that it\u2019s not our problem to fix. I\u2019ve never sensed my fianc\u00e9e truly loving my sister, but she\u2019s been cordial. She also said my siblings are too grown to be depending on their brother, especially since I plan to get married and have children in the next couple years. We do have 2 spare bedrooms, one which my fianc\u00e9e wanted to make an office but I said that could possibly wait since I\u2019m strongly considering them moving in for just a year. A YEAR. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e said within that year we\u2019d most likely never marry and that the dream family we planned on having wouldn\u2019t happen. I told her of course I\u2019d charge my siblings rent, because we did just move . She told me that was BS because neither of them have good jobs and that was the reason they never moved out of my moms to begin with. She also thinks a year is far to long, and most likely we wouldn\u2019t be able to get them out. I asked her what is the point of marriage if we can\u2019t make sacrifices together? A big reason I\u2019m marrying her is because how thoughtful and religious she is, but I\u2019m seeing a whole different person when we talk about this. I told her she was selfish asf for not understanding, and I know she would move her siblings in if the situation was reversed.

And she is right. Your siblings were depending on your mother. Who is gonna take  care of two adults and a child ? It's a huge responsability. Try to see things from her eyes.", ">I asked her what is the point of marriage if we can\u2019t make sacrifices together? \n\nThis is not the two of you making sacrifices together, this is her making extreme sacrifices for you. Your family will not be out in a year, that's complete BS, LOL! Also, your fianc\u00e9e knows exactly who will be doing all of the work taking care of them all and she knows that she will be paying half for all of them. If she's smart, and it sounds like she is, she will run as fast and as far away from this mess as humanly possible. YTA", "YTA\n\nYour family will never move out once they move in. She knows this. You know this (or should but are in denial). She doesn't want them moving into her home.\n\nIf you want to move them in just break up with her now.", "YTA. It's her house too, and she doesn't \"lack empathy\" because she's not willing to let two people (who will *almost certainly* not going to be out in a year) move in with her. It's admirable that you want to help your siblings, but there are ways to do that that don't involve unilaterally deciding that they're going to live in your house.", "YTA. You are welcome to set yourself on fire to keep your siblings warm as they enjoy their lifelong adolescence, but you have no right to expect anyone else to get out the gasoline.", "YTA - \"Which leaves me (as the oldest sibling) to fix things.\"  NO!  This is something that you want to do, it is NOT your responsibility.  This is, first of all, THEIR responsibility for their own life, or their father's NOT YOURS.  Your fiance has told you this is a 'deal-breaker' for her.  You have to decide who you want in your house/life AND why.\n\nOne question, who owns where you live now?", "Yeah, you\u2019re the asshole! Those are grown people", "INFO: is 26 yo employed? If their disability means they can't work, have you looked into gov't assistance programs?  \n\n\n>she seemed to have no empathy.\n\nthat's a 2 way street man.  \n\n\nShe just finished school. She thought she was about to start a life of her own with you and have children.\n\nAdding 2 grown adults and a baby is going to mean any vision she had, will be much harder. \n\nJust from a finances standpoint: you've got to feed these people, and the utilities they'll use.\n\nThat does mean less resources available to you two as a starting family.\n\nYou do say that you'll only let them stay a year...\n\nAfter living with mom and dad their entire lives... I can easily see this turning into a forever situation where they...you know..just dont leave because there's no 'inciting incident'  \n\n\nWhile it's awful... I think mom going into a home is the best 'kick in the ass' you'll ever have to get these people out and at least trying to be capable of living on their own. I would maybe help them find an apartment to share...research gov't assistance programs if 26 yo can't work because of his disability. \n\nwhy is it a WHOLE YEAR and not a month, while they look for apartments?   \n\n\nThey dont need to save up for a downpayment on a house, they need to get a job (or gov't assistance...at least 22yo has a job...) and find a cheap place to rent together.", "YTA\n\nYou are forgetting this is her home as well. This what they call a 1 no 2 yes situation. it requires you to both agree.\n\nIf she has veto'd  by saying No this you need to live with it. If you move them in anyway behind her back, she will probably leave you.\n\nShe has made it very clear she is not on board with this.\n\nShe is right once they are in your place they will never leave and this will crush your ambitions to marry and have children. Find another solution", "YTA she's explicitly telling you she doesn't want to support, parent, or help family members who cannot take care of themselves. She's doesn't want to spend her life caring for a child that isn't hers, a SIL who cannot support herself, or disabled in-laws. It seems the two of you are no longer compatible.", "YTA\n\nI agree with everything your fianc\u00e9e has said.  \n\nIt's only natural that you want to look after your siblings, but unless this was something your fianc\u00e9e knew was on the cards when you got together she has every right to not be on board with this.\n\nYou need to make the choice whether you want to be your siblings' carer or a husband and father because I don't think you can be both, at least not with your current fianc\u00e9e.", "NAH - You don't want your family on the streets and that's understandable. But you can't just move them in with her adamantly against moving them in\n\nShe's not wrong though about them probably never leaving if they move in. And I could see how she wouldn't want to have 2 grown adults and child encroaching on her space, especially in a 2 bedroom apartment. \n\nIt sounds like you have different priorities. Good luck", "YTA. You are choosing your family over your future with your fianc\u00e9e. I wouldn't blame her if she moved out. She didn't sign up to babysit your autistic brother or sister & kid. You are trampling her wants & needs for Adults. Not young children. Look for housing solutions for your brother such as group home, ect. Does he qualify for Medicaid? That'll help when looking for placement. Your sister needs to get a decent job with which to support herself. Where is the baby daddy & why isn't she getting Gov. aid aka welfare/child support?", "YTA, failure to plan on your sibling\u2019s part does not constitute an emergency or requirement to assist on you and especially your fianc\u00e9\u2019s part. \n\nShe is looking at everything as a logical observer while you are seeing it through an emotionally charged lens. \n\nIf you move them in be prepared to lose your potential family.", "YTA.  Asking to move three people in with you and a your spouse to be is a huge ask.  And  she is right, they didnt leave your mom's home so they are unlikely to leave your home, at least not willingly.  It is one thing to ask respectfully,  and accept their answer. However calling  her selfish is uncalled for.  If you cant accept the answer, break off the engagement and move out.", "YTA big time. Like wow", "YTA. She made it clear what her limits were and you offered no discussion at the time but are now trying to unilaterally force her into sharing her home (yes, it's hers to) with others. When she resists and explain what the consequences will be, you go into a snit. That's not considerate partner behavior. Understand that if you move others in over her objections it's going to end the relationship, and that it won't be because of her but because of you.", "I don't think the point of marriage is to \"make sacrifices together.\" Rather, it's to build a life together with both spouses' goals in mind. Any sacrifices should be agreed upon by both spouses, and your fianc\u00e9e is not agreeing to this particular sacrifice. Having family members living in your home is a huge intrusion, one she clearly rejects.\n\nFind another way to assist your family.", "NAH If you push this you will become single.", "YTA - No way would I want anyone moving in with me. Especially not my siblings or my husband\u2019s siblings. There is a such thing as low income housing. They need to learn obviously the hard way (since they have been enabled by your Mom all these years) that they have to depend on themselves.", "YTA. You said that you guys are planning to marry and start a family within the next year, but then want to move two grown ass adults and a child into your home? She has every right to not want them in her home with no clear set move out date. Even if it is only for a year, a year is a long time to have guests in your home. And that's even if they are able to move out in a year. They've been dependent on others' financial support for so long now that it's unlikely that they will be stable enough to move out within a year.", "YTA, this is her home too and she feels uncomfortable to share. Who will look after your brother with severe autism and financially support your sister with a child? How much do you expect your fianc\u00e9 to sacrifice if her time, money, privacy and peace?", "YTA.\n\nHoly moly.\n\nShe's pretty much right on everything. This sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nHere's how these things usually work: 1 year turns into permanent. Until she leaves you.", "You have different priorities.\n\nYour fiance knows darned good and well that if your family moves in-they will *never* move out. And she isn\u2019t enthusiastic about legally binding herself to you and starting a family under these conditions. \n\nAt least you let her know your priorities *now*, rather than after you are married or have gotten her pregnant. \n\nYTA This is not her fault. You want different things. Now you know she doesn\u2019t want to become a caretaker for several people, two of whom are grown ass adults. Let her go.", "YTA --  the minute you even thought about putting your mom in a nursing home, you should have been looking for a placement for your brother.  And your sister?  Where is the father of her her kid?  Why is he not helping.  \n\nIf you cannot accept that you are the ONLY saivor, these people will be with you for life", "She's not selfish,  she's examining with clarity,  the impact that something like this would have on her daily life.  These aren't children,  they are adults so they too need to be encouraged and directed to learn to fix their issues independently.  You are only taking on the same enabler role that your mother did by saying it's your problem to fix.\n\nIt's not and you can help everyone brainstorm for reasonable solutions to the issue. It must start with your siblings though.", "Neither of you are jerks.  I understand her feelings. Dealing with severe disabilities is not an easy adjustment for someone who didn't plan on it and guess what? Virtually Nobody does. . On top of that, people have their own personalities and mindsets so it's going to be chaos for her. You might need to think about letting her go.", "YTA. You may think it's your responsibility, but it is definitely not *her* responsibility. And she is right that it will be a disaster (for example, \"neither of them have good jobs \" and \"most likely we wouldn\u2019t be able to get them out\". \n\n> I\u2019m seeing a whole different person when we talk about this.\n\nMaybe you're not as compatible as you think; and it's best you learn this before marriage. You are being selfish regarding *her*, and it is also *her* house. She has every right to say no. If you try to force this, don't be surprised if she leaves when inevitably this all turns into the disaster she's predicting.", "YTA, not for asking, but for getting hung up on the denial. A very nice guy I am sure, but with shitty foresight.\n\nNot all of us want to be taking care of everyone else's family, especially to the extent of cohabitating. Maybe if you both had discussed this previously and she had indicated she shares your values about taking care of family, this would be a different situation. But signing up to partner with one autonomous adult and then being landed with a bunch of extra responsibilities just makes you deceptively more high maintenance and carrying secret baggage than the person she got engaged with.\n\nI'm sorry about your family. But if that truly is your priority to house them indefinitely long term (anything longer than a couple months will inevitably stagnate), she is not the partner for you. And you are not the partner for her.", "Is this actually the fianc\u00e9e writing? Because, even from what I must assume is the most positive perspective, the situation sounds like a damn nightmare. But sure, go ahead and move your family in. You\u2019ll have plenty of room, because your soon to be ex-fianc\u00e9e will be long gone. Unlike your family. You\u2019ll be stuck with them forever. YTA", "Having them stay with you for a week, ok.  \nA month, maybe.  \nA friggin year, no, no, no, no, no.  \n\n\nYTA", "This response is for both your financee and you. \n\nFiancee, move out for a year and absolutely do not marry this man. You will be miserable and seeking divorce at some point.\n\nOP, go ahead and move your family in, they are obviously important to you. \n\nIf after a year the family has moved, then you both can reconsider your relationship regarding a future marriage and children.", "Yta shes not selfish for not wanting 3? People to move in. Some who are going to cramp her life\n\nWhy cant those 3 people live together without you involved\n\nIf you dont want to marry her thats valid though", "YTA\n\nAre you for real? What you\u2019re proposing is extreme. \n\nYour siblings come with a lot of baggage and they really ought to be fending for themselves at this point. Asking your gf to take on that burden for a whole year is too much. And what\u2019s going to happen after a year? They\u2019re just going to magically become independent adults and move out on their own?\n\nSurely you could support them in other ways. If they could have paid you rent, they can pay someone else rent, and you could provide support by helping them learn to be more independent.", "'A YEAR.'\n\nYTA. That is waaaay too long, and given your siblings haven't had any inclination to become independent whilst living with your mother, why on earth do you think this would change living with you?\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e isn't selfish or thoughtless; she's smart and she's right not to enable fully grown adults to be dependent on others.", "I'm sorry but YTA. It's completely unreasonable to expect your wife to be okay with 3 whole people moving into your home for A YEAR. A year is an insanely long time to have extra people living in your home... especially when you don't want them their in the first place and one of them in young child. I thought you just wanted them to move in for a couple of months but a year is waaaay to long, your fianc\u00e9 is right! \n\nAlso she brings up completely valid points you're trying to ignore. You say they'll pay rent but if they don't have stable or good jobs how are they going to do that? A year is a long time to get comfortable somewhere, how likely is it that you could have them move out after a year if your fianc\u00e9 agreed to have them move in? You're siblings are grown adults they need to figure out their own lives and shouldn't be expecting they can just move out of mommy's house into big brothers like it's nothing", "YTA. They've been living with your mom for years and still aren't supporting themselves. So what makes you think they'll do it after one year? One year will turn into many years. You're the selfish one to demand that your fiancee help support your siblings when they're both adults who should support themselves.", "YTA - You are selfish and perpetuating codependency rooted in your family or origin.
