Their dad, (who\u2019s not my dad) lives states away and hasn\u2019t offered to help or take them in during this time. Which leaves me (as the oldest sibling) to fix things. While my fianc\u00e9e is aware of everything that\u2019s going on, before we even starting talking about arrangements she told me \u201cdon\u2019t even think about moving everyone in here.\u201d\n\nI told her she needs to consider what my family is going through, and she seemed to have no empathy. She started throwing out how my sister has always been co-dependent on my mom with her kid and that it\u2019s not our problem to fix. I\u2019ve never sensed my fianc\u00e9e truly loving my sister, but she\u2019s been cordial.

She told me that was BS because neither of them have good jobs and that was the reason they never moved out of my moms to begin with.

Try to see things from her eyes.", ">I asked her what is the point of marriage if we can\u2019t make sacrifices together? \n\nThis is not the two of you making sacrifices together, this is her making extreme sacrifices for you. Your family will not be out in a year, that's complete BS, LOL! Also, your fianc\u00e9e knows exactly who will be doing all of the work taking care of them all and she knows that she will be paying half for all of them. If she's smart, and it sounds like she is, she will run as fast and as far away from this mess as humanly possible. YTA", "YTA\n\nYour family will never move out once they move in. She knows this. You know this (or should but are in denial). She doesn't want them moving into her home.\n\nIf you want to move them in just break up with her now.", "YTA. It's her house too, and she doesn't \"lack empathy\" because she's not willing to let two people (who are *almost certainly* not going to be out in a year) move in with her. It's admirable that you want to help your siblings, but there are ways to do that that don't involve unilaterally deciding that they're going to live in your house.", "YTA. You are welcome to set yourself on fire to keep your siblings warm as they enjoy their lifelong adolescence, but you have no right to expect anyone else to get out the gasoline.", "YTA - \"Which leaves me (as the oldest sibling) to fix things.\"  NO!  This is something that you want to do, it is NOT your responsibility.  This is, first of all, THEIR responsibility for their own life, or their father's NOT YOURS.  Your fiance has told you this is a 'deal-breaker' for her.  You have to decide who you want in your house/life AND why.\n\nOne question, who owns where you live now?", "Yeah, you\u2019re the asshole! Those are grown people", "INFO: a few questions, and a ramble:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**is 26 yo employed?**\n\n**If their disability means they can't work, have you looked into gov't assistance programs?**\n\n**why is it a WHOLE YEAR and not a month or 2, while they look for apartments?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>she seemed to have no empathy.\n\nthat's a 2 way street man.\n\nShe just finished school. She thought she was about to start a life of her own with you and have children.\n\nAdding 2 grown adults and a baby is going to mean any vision she had, will be much harder.\n\nJust from a finances standpoint: you've got to feed these people, and the utilities they'll use.\n\nThat does mean less resources available to you two as a starting family.\n\nYou do say that you'll only let them stay a year...\n\nAfter living with mom and dad their entire lives... I can easily see this turning into a forever situation where they...you know..just dont leave because there's no 'inciting incident'\n\nWhile it's awful... I think mom going into a home is the best 'kick in the ass' you'll ever have to get these people out and at least trying to be capable of living on their own. I would maybe help them find an apartment to share...research gov't assistance programs if 26 yo can't work because of his disability.\n\n**They dont need to save up for a downpayment on a house, they need to get a job (or gov't assistance...at least 22yo has a job...) and find a cheap place to rent together.**  \n\n\nReally my request for info was to make you consider the ridiculousness of it all. I think im going with YTA", "YTA\n\nYou are forgetting this is her home as well. This what they call a 1 no 2 yes situation. it requires you to both agree.\n\nIf she has veto'd  by saying No this you need to live with it. If you move them in anyway behind her back, she will probably leave you.\n\nShe has made it very clear she is not on board with this.\n\nShe is right once they are in your place they will never leave and this will crush your ambitions to marry and have children. Find another solution", "YTA she's explicitly telling you she doesn't want to support, parent, or help family members who cannot take care of themselves. She's doesn't want to spend her life caring for a child that isn't hers, a SIL who cannot support herself, or disabled in-laws. It seems the two of you are no longer compatible.", "YTA\n\nI agree with everything your fianc\u00e9e has said.  \n\nIt's only natural that you want to look after your siblings, but unless this was something your fianc\u00e9e knew was on the cards when you got together she has every right to not be on board with this.\n\nYou need to make the choice whether you want to be your siblings' carer or a husband and father because I don't think you can be both, at least not with your current fianc\u00e9e.", "NAH - You don't want your family on the streets and that's understandable. But you can't just move them in with her adamantly against moving them in\n\nShe's not wrong though about them probably never leaving if they move in. And I could see how she wouldn't want to have 2 grown adults and child encroaching on her space, especially in a 2 bedroom apartment. \n\nIt sounds like you have different priorities. Good luck", "YTA. You are choosing your family over your future with your fianc\u00e9e. I wouldn't blame her if she moved out. She didn't sign up to babysit your autistic brother or sister & kid. You are trampling her wants & needs for Adults. Not young children. Look for housing solutions for your brother such as group home, ect. Does he qualify for Medicaid? That'll help when looking for placement. Your sister needs to get a decent job with which to support herself. Where is the baby daddy & why isn't she getting Gov. aid aka welfare/child support?", "YTA, failure to plan on your sibling\u2019s part does not constitute an emergency or requirement to assist on you and especially your fianc\u00e9\u2019s part. \n\nShe is looking at everything as a logical observer while you are seeing it through an emotionally charged lens. \n\nIf you move them in be prepared to lose your potential family.", "YTA.  Asking to move three people in with you and a your spouse to be is a huge ask.  And  she is right, they didnt leave your mom's home so they are unlikely to leave your home, at least not willingly.  It is one thing to ask respectfully,  and accept their answer. However calling  her selfish is uncalled for.  If you cant accept the answer, break off the engagement and move out.", "YTA big time. Like wow", "YTA. She made it clear what her limits were and you offered no discussion at the time but are now trying to unilaterally force her into sharing her home (yes, it's hers to) with others. When she resists and explain what the consequences will be, you go into a snit. That's not considerate partner behavior. Understand that if you move others in over her objections it's going to end the relationship, and that it won't be because of her but because of you.", "I don't think the point of marriage is to \"make sacrifices together.\" Rather, it's to build a life together with both spouses' goals in mind. Any sacrifices should be agreed upon by both spouses, and your fianc\u00e9e is not agreeing to this particular sacrifice. Having family members living in your home is a huge intrusion, one she clearly rejects.\n\nFind another way to assist your family.", "NAH If you push this you will become single.", "YTA - No way would I want anyone moving in with me. Especially not my siblings or my husband\u2019s siblings. There is a such thing as low income housing. They need to learn obviously the hard way (since they have been enabled by your Mom all these years) that they have to depend on themselves.", "YTA. You said that you guys are planning to marry and start a family within the next year, but then want to move two grown ass adults and a child into your home? She has every right to not want them in her home with no clear set move out date. Even if it is only for a year, a year is a long time to have guests in your home. And that's even if they are able to move out in a year. They've been dependent on others' financial support for so long now that it's unlikely that they will be stable enough to move out within a year.", "YTA, this is her home too and she feels uncomfortable to share. Who will look after your brother with severe autism and financially support your sister with a child? How much do you expect your fianc\u00e9 to sacrifice if her time, money, privacy and peace?", "YTA.\n\nHoly moly.\n\nShe's pretty much right on everything. This sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nHere's how these things usually work: 1 year turns into permanent. Until she leaves you.", "You have different priorities.\n\nYour fiance knows darned good and well that if your family moves in-they will *never* move out. And she isn\u2019t enthusiastic about legally binding herself to you and starting a family under these conditions. \n\nAt least you let her know your priorities *now*, rather than after you are married or have gotten her pregnant. \n\nYTA This is not her fault. You want different things. Now you know she doesn\u2019t want to become a caretaker for several people, two of whom are grown ass adults. Let her go.", "YTA --  the minute you even thought about putting your mom in a nursing home, you should have been looking for a placement for your brother.  And your sister?  Where is the father of her her kid?  Why is he not helping.  \n\nIf you cannot accept that you are the ONLY saivor, these people will be with you for life", "She's not selfish,  she's examining with clarity,  the impact that something like this would have on her daily life.  These aren't children,  they are adults so they too need to be encouraged and directed to learn to fix their issues independently.  You are only taking on the same enabler role that your mother did by saying it's your problem to fix.\n\nIt's not and you can help everyone brainstorm for reasonable solutions to the issue. It must start with your siblings though.", "Neither of you are jerks.  I understand her feelings. Dealing with severe disabilities is not an easy adjustment for someone who didn't plan on it and guess what? Virtually Nobody does. . On top of that, people have their own personalities and mindsets so it's going to be chaos for her. You might need to think about letting her go.", "YTA. You may think it's your responsibility, but it is definitely not *her* responsibility. And she is right that it will be a disaster (for example, \"neither of them have good jobs \" and \"most likely we wouldn\u2019t be able to get them out\". \n\n> I\u2019m seeing a whole different person when we talk about this.\n\nMaybe you're not as compatible as you think; and it's best you learn this before marriage. You are being selfish regarding *her*, and it is also *her* house. She has every right to say no. If you try to force this, don't be surprised if she leaves when inevitably this all turns into the disaster she's predicting.", "YTA, not for asking, but for getting hung up on the denial. A very nice guy I am sure, but with shitty foresight.\n\nNot all of us want to be taking care of everyone else's family, especially to the extent of cohabitating. Maybe if you both had discussed this previously and she had indicated she shares your values about taking care of family, this would be a different situation. But signing up to partner with one autonomous adult and then being landed with a bunch of extra responsibilities just makes you deceptively more high maintenance and carrying secret baggage than the person she got engaged with.\n\nI'm sorry about your family. But if that truly is your priority to house them indefinitely long term (anything longer than a couple months will inevitably stagnate), she is not the partner for you. And you are not the partner for her.", "Is this actually the fianc\u00e9e writing? Because, even from what I must assume is the most positive perspective, the situation sounds like a damn nightmare. But sure, go ahead and move your family in. You\u2019ll have plenty of room, because your soon to be ex-fianc\u00e9e will be long gone. Unlike your family. You\u2019ll be stuck with them forever.

You will be miserable and seeking divorce at some point.\n\nOP, go ahead and move your family in, they are obviously important to you. \n\nIf after a year the family has moved, then you both can reconsider your relationship regarding a future marriage and children.", "Yta shes not selfish for not wanting 3? People to move in. Some who are going to cramp her life\n\nWhy cant those 3 people live together without you involved\n\nIf you dont want to marry her thats valid though", "YTA\n\nAre you for real? What you\u2019re proposing is extreme. \n\nYour siblings come with a lot of baggage and they really ought to be fending for themselves at this point. Asking your gf to take on that burden for a whole year is too much. And what\u2019s going to happen after a year? They\u2019re just going to magically become independent adults and move out on their own?\n\nSurely you could support them in other ways. If they could have paid you rent, they can pay someone else rent, and you could provide support by helping them learn to be more independent.", "'A YEAR.'\n\nYTA. That is waaaay too long, and given your siblings haven't had any inclination to become independent whilst living with your mother, why on earth do you think this would change living with you?\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e isn't selfish or thoughtless; she's smart and she's right not to enable fully grown adults to be dependent on others.", "I'm sorry but YTA. It's completely unreasonable to expect your wife to be okay with 3 whole people moving into your home for A YEAR. A year is an insanely long time to have extra people living in your home... especially when you don't want them there in the first place and one of them is a young child. I thought you just wanted them to move in for a couple of months but a year is waaaay to long, your fianc\u00e9 is right! \n\nAlso she brings up completely valid points you're trying to ignore. You say they'll pay rent but if they don't have stable or good jobs how are they going to do that? A year is a long time to get comfortable somewhere, how likely is it that you could have them move out after a year if your fianc\u00e9 agreed to have them move in? You're siblings are grown adults they need to figure out their own lives and shouldn't be expecting they can just move out of mommy's house into big brothers like it's nothing", "YTA. They've been living with your mom for years and still aren't supporting themselves. So what makes you think they'll do it after one year? One year will turn into many years. You're the selfish one to demand that your fiancee help support your siblings when they're both adults who should support themselves.", "YTA - You are selfish and perpetuating codependency rooted in your family or origin.

Are you planning to quit your job and care for him? Hire a full time caregiver? Do you have the money to do that? Or do you expect her to give up her life to care for him since she is an RN? Or is he actually high functioning and you are just calling him severely autistic to gain sympathy?\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have to love your sister. She isn\u2019t marrying her. She is nice to her and polite. I don\u2019t blame her for being irritated by her. Your fianc\u00e9 has spent her adult life working her butt off to finally be in a stable place to start a family.

I know, I am a nursing professor and as hard and unsympathetic as I might seem to be on you, I am equally as hard and unsympathetic on my students, and I am known as \u201cthe nice one\u201d.

A compromise is six months and a lease signed that they must vacate at that time with no extensions granted. Make sure your wife and only your wife has power to enforce it legally. No veto power on your part, iron clad. You can use the 6 months to get your brother housing and care (there are benefits and housing he can apply for many places) and assist your sister in finding a stable job and housing.

You don't get to make unilateral decisions when you're in a relationship.", "NTA, but, ESH!\n\nFirst, sorry about your Mom. A lot of commenters are assuming a lot about your mom's illness and progression timeline and I'm sad at the level of anger and cruelty being hurdled at you for caring about your family and feeling confused about how to help them \n\nIf there was a rapid progression or she or the siblings were good at covering for a long time, it is absolutely possible that there wasn't a lot of time to prepare. Also, if it has only mostly been the 3 of them caring for her, up until placing her in care, it takes a lot of time and energy and there is often a period of denial and unreasonable hope, such that there isn't a lot of time to plan, prepare for everything else. It's an awful disease and it's a thousand deaths and for all intents and purposes, the 3 of them have lost their mother, who apparently did not plan well for the future. I suspect OP is in shock and grieving and also scared. Fiance panicked, understandably, but didn't come across very compassionate to O P or his family, but we weren't given lots of info around that. It sounds like they could use some help communicating and OP needs some help understanding what he can get them help with and how to navigate being kind and supportive but not losing his life plans and dreams or his fiance, if possible.\n\nYes, we would all like life to fit into a perfect picture, but the reality is that most of us feel a pull between our families of birth and our adult relationships/new chosen family and something like this would feel challenging. (Note that OP stated that the fiance would definitely want their family to move in with them if the situation was reversed, no way to know for sure, but worth noting). \n\nSo many assumptions and protections from commenters!! Sad truth is so many marriages don't work out, such that apparently romantic partners are replaceable, but a family that hasn't done something unacceptable/unforgivable isn't. I can see the reasonable concerns the fiance has, but I think the comments about OP just wanting to use and abuse the fiance because he thought she had certain beliefs and values that now seem different since this experience, is not a fair conclusion. We weren't given much about the 22 year old sister with a 4 year old (preg at 17ish) but the slut shaming is lovely here \ud83d\ude41. \n\nSo, OP, I actually think the question is less about your fiance for now and more about questions around\nhow you might rapidly do your best by your siblings and not blow up your life. So things like:\nIs your brother eligible for assistance resources and how can you help him access those?\nDoes your Mom have any financial resources beyond her care needs that can be leveraged?\nIf you weren't here, what would they need and how would they get it?\nHow can they/you enlist their bio Dad to step up?\nWhere are they capable and how can you encourage them?\nWhere can you get help to navigate all this?\n\nIt is admirable that you care and want to help your siblings, in what seems like a dire situation and in times that just securing basic housing is becoming unattainable for many. But it truly isn't your responsibility, though I don't see how you could walk away if there aren't any other solutions to assist them - that will be a tough call.\n\nThat doesn't mean your fiance is TA either. She has very fair concerns, is just getting a sigh of relief after completing a rigorous achievement and was getting ready for starting your plans together. \n\nI think overall, that is the rub, life is what happens while you are making other plans, and life showed up. This is your first real test as a couple. How do you communicate and support each other through difficult, messy, undesired life happenings? It seems all she heard was, this really upsetting this is happening and she has to do something she doesn't feel good about. Fair first reaction. But then, where is the compassion for your fear, feelings, sad circumstances and stepping up as your partner to see your concerns and a desire to try to come up with realistic solutions together. Life will keep happening.\n\nGood luck!", "NAH. She\u2019s not wrong that they\u2019ll be there forever, and she has the right to want you two to build your own life. However she also needs to realize that you\u2019re not someone to turn your back in family.\n\nBe realistic about your game plan with your brother. I can\u2019t see you tossing him out in a year if he can\u2019t support himself, which may very well be the case.\n\nAs for your sister, she may be right about that. She\u2019s a free loader and needs a push to fly the nest.

You just assumed your could guilt your fianc\u00e9 into putting her life on hold too take care of your adult siblings for god knows how long.
