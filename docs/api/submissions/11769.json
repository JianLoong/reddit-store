Then you mention that he pays for 3 trips a month. Like we are talking what 15-20 vacations in 6 months?!? You also mention he likes flying first class. I guess what I\u2019m saying here is what is your vacation budget that he is completely fronting? Why did you decide to split rent 60/40 with him paying less? When you say he makes 5x what you make, are you making a decent income and he\u2019s just wealthy and much older or are you living lower middle class near the poverty line and he\u2019s just merely doing well?

For example, if you rent a smaller apartment or a room in a cheaper area, are careful how you use the utilities and what food you buy?\n\nIt makes sense for you to stay with your family when you visit, because that is the purpose of going there - to see your family.

And now that she wants to go home, she should be allowed to choose any kind of accommodations she wants, or that she can realistically afford.\n\nThis is absolute bullshit.\n\nBy that logic, she shouldn't be allowed to book an economy plane ticket either because he has purchased 1st class tickets in the past.", "Yes that's correct.", "I thought he paid more, with him paying 60 and OP paying 40?", "Hey sorry for the confusion.

Sorry, but no, that's not how it works. OP and bf are clearly not compatible. OP enjoys living above her means, and she's only pissed when bf doesn't want to spend money on what she wants [by mentioning that's why she asked her mom for money, and didn't discuss it with him]. Fair enough, she doesn't like this situation, but you can't both want to profit off of someone and be angry that he also wants to be taken into consideration when she plans stuff.\n\nHe plans stuff with his money, and she comes along for the free ride and all's good. When she plans stuff with her money (given by her mom, in this case), she wants to leave him home because she can't afford a hotel with him. She then proposes a guest bedroom when he insists, that she herself wouldn't nornally use, and he refuses because ofc, you're not comfortable staying with a stranger when you can pay for a hotel. He proposes she actually spends some of this money on a hotel, since it's clearly possible due to ticket price, but she refuses because she wants to spend it on shopping. How is that victim behaviour? \n\nIn short, ESH. Bf clearly shows ah behaviour by not accepting he's dating someone who's broke Af, but he's not alienating her from her family. OP is clearly an AH as she enjoys taking advantage of someone else's money but doesn't want to share any of hers, which, funnily enough, is actually somebody else's money too, in this case. OP likes free money and not taking responsibility to take care of her wants with HER OWN money.

What is happening here?", "We literally have no idea and you are projecting your own biases here. We know he offers the trips and she goes on the trips.

I wanna be able to soak up every moment that I can. This isn't a vacation to go be a tourist with the boyfriend. He proposed to stay in a hotel because that's what he's accustomed to. She gave him options, and he said no. So he can either go and stay in a hotel by himself and do what he wants, or he doesn't have to go at all. I feel like he throws a fit if she doesn't do what he wants to do on vacations. She buys her own plane tickets, but because he wants to fly 1st class, he upgrades both of them. That's on him, not on her.\n\nShe's gone for a week, so her mom is giving her extra money to be able to get some shopping done and get food while she's there. That's not his money to dictate how she spends. \n\nYou're also assuming that the boyfriend doesn't offer to pay for all of their vacations. If you notice, they always go where he wants to go. So he really doesn't care what she wants. Here's the thing he doesn't have to go at all. He can actually go to a destination that he wants to go to and spend the money how he wants to. \n\nIt truly sounds like the boyfriend is forcing her to live above her means.

He turned it down. You might want to watch Joy Luck Club. The movie goes over a situation similar to this. 60/40 when he makes five times as much as you is him pretending to be fair. NTA. \n\nIf he wants to go on trips with you, he should be paying for them. If you have a partner that makes significantly less money than you but he still wants to live his lifestyle, he needs to pay for you. Trying to loot out of the money your mom gave you to go home is vile.", "NTA. You need to reevaluate this relationship. There are major red flags. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA friend, and for a variety of reasons. Your bf is not acting like a life partner. He\u2019s more interested in his comfort than your long term financial well-being; that\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t consider your well-being to be part of his well-being, ya dig?", "Ummm, NTA. What the hell is your boyfriend smoking? He knows you don't have the funds. He's being an asshole. Apparently you are just supposed to be his arm candy and go only the places he wants to go and if you have a wish it's not important. He needs to realize just because he has money that doesn't mean he gets to dictate you 24/7. Visiting your family is important and isn't \"not spend(ing) any time with him.\" He's controlling. See this behavior for what it is and decide if you can deal with it for long term.", "NTA - first of all, if he makes 5 times what you make, then the split should be between 80/20 and 85/15 not 60/40.  \n\nAre you a sugar baby or his partner?  Just because you make less money, it doesn't mean that you get less choice in all aspects of the relationship.  While certainly it is nice that he can afford to travel with you and is willing to foot the bill so long as it is a destination he chooses, that doesn't mean he gets to dictate that you can ONLY travel where he chooses.  If you want to travel to visit family, and he wants to accompany you, and he is uncomfortable with the cheap/free accomodations, than he can pick up the hotel bill that makes him happy, as well as picking up the bulk of meals at restaurants if he insists on going to ones that are more expensive than you and your family can afford.  If he is insisting on a luxury experience wherever he goes, when he travels with people of different financial means, he can either accept what they can afford or pick up their tab.  That is his choice.  \n\nIf he wants to live with you as a life partner. and is unwilling to downscale his lifestyle so you can contribute a larger percentage of the costs, then he either needs to pay the difference or find a partner whose income is similar to his and wants to live the same kind of lifestyle.", "NTA. His behaviour is odd here. He makes 5x what you do. He has to know that fancy hotels are out of the question. Why is this being made a big deal? He could stay home. You live together, so it\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t seen each other plenty, as it is.", "That's what I was doing previously. I had a smaller apartment, closer to work, budgeted, and my mom helped out with groceries. I moved far from home with a new job and no friends and family here. \n\nHe will probably want to spend the time not with my family. I'm not sure. \n\nHe asked so I felt obliged. I do agree that's its a red flag for him to tell me that as well. My mom told me to spend it on food and flight.", "He's honestly really nice and laid back. I guess I am too. This is the first time that I've seen him get upset like this. But it's not the first time I felt controlled by him.", "He definitely insisted on a bigger place further out from my work. I moved here for work. He wanted to initially go 50/50 but I told him that I'm barely affording my place and couldn't go any higher. He settled on a place 40 mins from my job but gave him a big house for a 40/60 split. \n\n I got most of my furniture for free or used in Craigslist so nothing was matching. He didn't like that and purchased mostly new furniture for the new house.", "I have family in different parts. This recent trip was to visit extended family that I haven't seen for 6 years. We only spent two days with them. \n\nThis time I want to visit home home which is the place that I grew up and moved away from 2 years ago. This is where my immediate family and friends all live.", "I guess his argument was that I was being selfish only thinking about a ticket for me and a place for me to stay. And not considering him. He said if the roles were reversed, how would I be able to join all his trips. I told him that I simply wouldn't go....", "That is not a compromise. That is your rich boyfriend taking $400 from your mother.", "Your boyfriend is financially abusive", "You deserve better. Just saying. NAH.", "This is a bad place to be. I\u2019ve been there too. He gets used to making all the decisions and comes to see that as the normal state of things. And you feel like you can\u2019t have a voice in anything, because of the money. Then when something comes up that really matters to you, and for once you stand up for what you want, he acts like you\u2019re being outrageous. Like, how dare you. \n\nIs that how you feel? It\u2019s a really bad place to be. Being broke and in charge of your own life is better than being beholden to someone who won\u2019t let you forget how much you owe him.", "Think about this please.  Do you want to feel like you have no say for the rest of your life?", "I don't work or drive. My bf drives me 4 hrs and sits with me in my parents smoke filled house. Takes them to dinner, buys my nieces and nephews toys and clothes and never ever says a bad word about it. I have cleaned his sick mother in hospice. Your person is very very selfish and obviously does not care for you the way one deserves to be cared for. keeping tally of finances is ridiculous. Money is to be shared reasonably between two committed people. He's not committed.", "I really don\u2019t get why he has to go on this trip with you. Seems like no matter what you do he is just going to hold it over you. It also seems like it would be much easier and more enjoyable for you to go alone. Cheaper, simpler, more time with family. So why not do that? Are you insisting on him coming along for some reason, or is he?\n\nI\u2019m also curious about the other frequent trips you\u2019re taking together. Are you requesting he brings you along on these trips? Most people can\u2019t afford to travel so much \u2014 you may have to accept that you can\u2019t keep up with that part of his lifestyle. If (as I suspect) it\u2019s him who wants you to come on all these trips, only to hold it against you later on, you should be telling him \u201cI\u2019m skipping this trip because I can\u2019t afford it and it\u2019s clearly a burden for you to pay my way.\u201d If he insists you need to come along, then it seems like it\u2019s really more about control.", "He isn\u2019t nice when you don\u2019t do what he wants though, is he? Hes only laid back when you do what he wants. 6 months is a really short time - honestly it\u2019s still the \u2018getting to know each other\u2019 phase in most relationships. \n\nYet already he\u2019s controlling, he\u2019s pushed you to live well above your means so you\u2019re broke, and he pays for all the nice things (that he wants to do, so you feel indebted) then uses that cash-splashing as justification for his AH-ness the moment you have a slight difference of opinion. Then he demands you spend money you don\u2019t have/that isn\u2019t yours and he will deign to suffer your hometown (but as you admit will not want you to spend time with your family but with him)\n\nYou\u2019re being abused. You\u2019re NTA. \n\nHe won\u2019t get better, he\u2019ll get worse.", "A nice person wouldn't do this", "This.", "This was definitely something that I was scared of. I didn't want to feel trapped. And now it does seem really normal... he pretty much makes all the decisions.", "He got upset and accused me of not wanting to spend my birthday with him when I proposed that I go alone since I can't afford the hotel. He feels that I should put up the extra 400 that my mom gave me to accommodate him. He brought up his exorbitant birthday costs that he also spent because he wanted to go to a very expensive club and get bottle service. \n\nHonestly most of the trips are trips to his home state. He has a house there. He wants to visit family and take care of business. I offer all the time to stay back because it's a trip really for him. He insists that I come. We have plans to go back this weekend which he threatened to take away during this recent fight (I know I know) but I told him that I wouldn't be upset and that it's his decision how he spends his money.", "Oof this hurt me. \ud83d\ude1e  I think you are correct....", ">The only thing is that my mother gave me that extra so I could obviously enjoy some shopping and food when I'm there.\n\nAND FOOD or is she not supposed to eat?", "Op that is NOT normal..", "I hate to say it but you aren't in a relationship, you are in a dictatorship.\n\nHe makes all the calls but isn't happy if you even want and/or say something different than he wants.\n\nHe is controlling you and it gets worse as the relationship goes one.\n\nUninvite from your trip home and go BE WITH YOUR FAMILY! DID YOU EVEN INVITE HIM? \n\nYou can go see your family without him.\n\nNo one needs to stay at a $400 hotel. He sounds like a little baby.\n\nHe doesn't have problems spending your money at all. WTF??!!\n\nTime to move on and find someone who VALUES you AS IS and doesn't expect you to do everything he wants.\n\nSeems to me he does all this ridiculous spending as a way to keep you from saving up enough money to leave him. Open your eyes!", "So, eating out is her only option? She can't afford to put 2 pennies together to afford food to cook for herself on what is otherwise a free trip? Don't try to make it sound like she's a victim of some horrible thing. Since her mother generously gave her money to come over and visit, she will host her in her house, and you don't think she'll feed her at home and she'll starve?! There's real victims out there, but none are here.\n\nI'm not saying OP shouldn't get to enjoy shopping and eating out, either on this trip or in general. I am also not saying that she HAS to get an expensive hotel with her current bf just to please him. She doesn't have to do any of it, it's her life and her choices. But she came here for judgement on a situation she described. And she described herself as enjoying free travel from her bf, 3x a month, and when she does have extra money, which in this case was gifted money, she doesn't want to share it, because she wants to go out and eat and shop. This specific situation and behaviour is what an AH would do. The remedy isn't to spend the money on the hotel, but to be honest with herself and have an honest conv with her bf to clear expectations.\n\nIf the situation was reversed and she was a dude with a wealthier GF, everybody would jump at him calling him pathetic that he can't afford shit, and he only has stuff because he takes advantage of independent women who have their own money, his gf and his mommy.", "> We literally have no idea and you are projecting your own biases here.\n\nThe same is true of you and your biases."]}
