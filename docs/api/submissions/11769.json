Then you mention that he pays for 3 trips a month. Like we are talking what 15-20 vacations in 6 months?!? You also mention he likes flying first class. I guess what I\u2019m saying here is what is your vacation budget that he is completely fronting? Why did you decide to split rent 60/40 with him paying less? When you say he makes 5x what you make, are you making a decent income and he\u2019s just wealthy and much older or are you living lower middle class near the poverty line and he\u2019s just merely doing well?

For example, if you rent a smaller apartment or a room in a cheaper area, are careful how you use the utilities and what food you buy?\n\nIt makes sense for you to stay with your family when you visit, because that is the purpose of going there - to see your family.

And now that she wants to go home, she should be allowed to choose any kind of accommodations she wants, or that she can realistically afford.\n\nThis is absolute bullshit.\n\nBy that logic, she shouldn't be allowed to book an economy plane ticket either because he has purchased 1st class tickets in the past.", "Yes that's correct.", "I thought he paid more, with him paying 60 and OP paying 40?", "Hey sorry for the confusion.

Sorry, but no, that's not how it works. OP and bf are clearly not compatible. OP enjoys living above her means, and she's only pissed when bf doesn't want to spend money on what she wants [by mentioning that's why she asked her mom for money, and didn't discuss it with him]. Fair enough, she doesn't like this situation, but you can't both want to profit off of someone and be angry that he also wants to be taken into consideration when she plans stuff.\n\nHe plans stuff with his money, and she comes along for the free ride and all's good. When she plans stuff with her money (given by her mom, in this case), she wants to leave him home because she can't afford a hotel with him. She then proposes a guest bedroom when he insists, that she herself wouldn't nornally use, and he refuses because ofc, you're not comfortable staying with a stranger when you can pay for a hotel. He proposes she actually spends some of this money on a hotel, since it's clearly possible due to ticket price, but she refuses because she wants to spend it on shopping. How is that victim behaviour? \n\nIn short, ESH. Bf clearly shows ah behaviour by not accepting he's dating someone who's broke Af, but he's not alienating her from her family. OP is clearly an AH as she enjoys taking advantage of someone else's money but doesn't want to share any of hers, which, funnily enough, is actually somebody else's money too, in this case. OP likes free money and not taking responsibility to take care of her wants with HER OWN money.

What is happening here?", "We literally have no idea and you are projecting your own biases here. We know he offers the trips and she goes on the trips.

I wanna be able to soak up every moment that I can. This isn't a vacation to go be a tourist with the boyfriend. He proposed to stay in a hotel because that's what he's accustomed to. She gave him options, and he said no. So he can either go and stay in a hotel by himself and do what he wants, or he doesn't have to go at all. I feel like he throws a fit if she doesn't do what he wants to do on vacations. She buys her own plane tickets, but because he wants to fly 1st class, he upgrades both of them. That's on him, not on her.\n\nShe's gone for a week, so her mom is giving her extra money to be able to get some shopping done and get food while she's there. That's not his money to dictate how she spends. \n\nYou're also assuming that the boyfriend doesn't offer to pay for all of their vacations. If you notice, they always go where he wants to go. So he really doesn't care what she wants. Here's the thing he doesn't have to go at all. He can actually go to a destination that he wants to go to and spend the money how he wants to. \n\nIt truly sounds like the boyfriend is forcing her to live above her means.

He turned it down. You might want to watch Joy Luck Club. The movie goes over a situation similar to this. 60/40 when he makes five times as much as you is him pretending to be fair. NTA. \n\nIf he wants to go on trips with you, he should be paying for them. If you have a partner that makes significantly less money than you but he still wants to live his lifestyle, he needs to pay for you. Trying to loot out of the money your mom gave you to go home is vile.", "NTA. You need to reevaluate this relationship.

He\u2019s more interested in his comfort than your long term financial well-being; that\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t consider your well-being to be part of his well-being, ya dig?", "Ummm, NTA. What the hell is your boyfriend smoking? He knows you don't have the funds. He's being an asshole. Apparently you are just supposed to be his arm candy and go only the places he wants to go and if you have a wish it's not important. He needs to realize just because he has money that doesn't mean he gets to dictate you 24/7. Visiting your family is important and isn't \"not spend(ing) any time with him.\" He's controlling. See this behavior for what it is and decide if you can deal with it for long term.", "NTA - first of all, if he makes 5 times what you make, then the split should be between 80/20 and 85/15 not 60/40.  \n\nAre you a sugar baby or his partner?  Just because you make less money, it doesn't mean that you get less choice in all aspects of the relationship.  While certainly it is nice that he can afford to travel with you and is willing to foot the bill so long as it is a destination he chooses, that doesn't mean he gets to dictate that you can ONLY travel where he chooses.  If you want to travel to visit family, and he wants to accompany you, and he is uncomfortable with the cheap/free accomodations, than he can pick up the hotel bill that makes him happy, as well as picking up the bulk of meals at restaurants if he insists on going to ones that are more expensive than you and your family can afford.  If he is insisting on a luxury experience wherever he goes, when he travels with people of different financial means, he can either accept what they can afford or pick up their tab.  That is his choice.  \n\nIf he wants to live with you as a life partner. and is unwilling to downscale his lifestyle so you can contribute a larger percentage of the costs, then he either needs to pay the difference or find a partner whose income is similar to his and wants to live the same kind of lifestyle.", "NTA. His behaviour is odd here. He makes 5x what you do. He has to know that fancy hotels are out of the question. Why is this being made a big deal? He could stay home.

I do agree that's its a red flag for him to tell me that as well. My mom told me to spend it on food and flight.", "He's honestly really nice and laid back. I guess I am too. This is the first time that I've seen him get upset like this. But it's not the first time I felt controlled by him.", "He definitely insisted on a bigger place further out from my work. I moved here for work. He wanted to initially go 50/50 but I told him that I'm barely affording my place and couldn't go any higher. He settled on a place 40 mins from my job but gave him a big house for a 40/60 split. \n\n I got most of my furniture for free or used in Craigslist so nothing was matching.

This is where my immediate family and friends all live.", "I guess his argument was that I was being selfish only thinking about a ticket for me and a place for me to stay. And not considering him.

So why not do that? Are you insisting on him coming along for some reason, or is he?\n\nI\u2019m also curious about the other frequent trips you\u2019re taking together. Are you requesting he brings you along on these trips? Most people can\u2019t afford to travel so much \u2014 you may have to accept that you can\u2019t keep up with that part of his lifestyle.

This specific situation and behaviour is what an AH would do. The remedy isn't to spend the money on the hotel, but to be honest with herself and have an honest conv with her bf to clear expectations.\n\nIf the situation was reversed and she was a dude with a wealthier GF, everybody would jump at him calling him pathetic that he can't afford shit, and he only has stuff because he takes advantage of independent women who have their own money, his gf and his mommy.", "> We literally have no idea and you are projecting your own biases here.\n\nThe same is true of you and your biases.", "NTA but why are you living with this ah after being together only 6 months???", "Nta", "How long have yall dated and lived together?

Those other vacations weren't really for you. They were for him. He was the one that chose where to go. Now he expects you to give up your spending money to pay for HIS hotel because he refuses a free room at your friend's place? He's spoiled, selfish and entitled. Don't back down on this.", "NTA- of course spending time with you family is the priority- that\u2019s why you are going!!!\nGo without him.", "NTA. Your bf sure is", "He makes FIVE TIMES as much as you and is expecting you to not only pay for %40 percent of an apartment that is likely out of your budget but also expects you to pay half of the hotel bills for hotels that he is choosing? Something fishy is going on here. NTA and I think you should reconsider this relationship", "The bill split of 60/40 is ridiculous if he makes 5 times as much as you. As an example if you make $50,000 a year, he makes $250,000. YT A to yourself for staying with a boyfriend who is so selfish. Go see a financial advisor who can help you figure out an equitable split of the bills.", "NTA. He brings up all the money spent and travelling that had been done as if your bank account is magically going to fill up. He cannot be mad if he\u2019s making that much more than you and wonders why you cannot afford things all the time.", "NTA. Your bf should really be concerned with you and him both being able to spend time with family. He should realize that if he cares about you then spending time with your family is important for him as well and whatever uncomfortableness comes with the trip isn\u2019t going to hurt him. He also should come from a place of understanding that you can\u2019t afford to split a hotel bill when you\u2019re already not paying for your own ticket and how that hasn\u2019t been taken into consideration by him is beyond me. You should go on the trip without him if he\u2019s not willing to stay at your friend\u2019s house or pay for a hotel. Honestly, the part of you going to visit your family is non negotiable at this point, they aren\u2019t going to be around forever and any time you are able to spend with them should be spent regardless if he is present or not.", "Info: why are you with this AH?", "NTA, except to yourself because you keep dating this man. Another age gap, another controlling man who wants everything his way. That's why he pays, so you get no say and as soon as you have a request he can ram it down your throat.", "Dude 6 months and multiple trips?  Do y'all have a job??\n\nPack your bags and just move back home without the bf", "My husband and I were 19 and 21 when we got together and we're now 29 and 31. My husband has always made at least 3x what I do (despite the fact that we've both had serious salary increases since then), and as a result, the things he wants to do drags our lifestyle budget up. If I tried to stick with close to 50/50 or even 60/40 from the time we started dating, I would have been fucking broke the entire time we've been together without a cent to my name if we ever broke up. Even my husband at 23 looked at the spreadsheet of our combined expenses and budget, looked at the line items he insisted were necessary and how much in the negative I would be under anything but an income equity model, and understood that wouldn't be a fair exchange for the amount of hours we were both working if he wanted me to succeed in life alongside him. How a 39 year old man thinks he can date outside of his income bracket and still insist a 60/40 break is equitable at the expense of you not seeing your family or having savings is beyond me. \n\nAll of our expenses (vacations and all) are listed as line items in our budget, and we have some items budgeted, such as parental visits, as number of times per year cost to keep things fair. Our budgetary contributions gets updated every pay raise we each get, and has since we were 19. I've been able to build personal savings, he's been able to have personal savings, our joint savings have fluorished under this model. \n\nNTA. And I don't think your partner is emotionally mature enough to have a girlfriend outside of his tax bracket if he's telling you to deprioritize your family because you can't afford to make him comfy enough to go see them.", "NTA, and he should probably just stay home. Never go in debt for someone else. You can't afford your own airfare, how can he expect you to provide lodging? Boyfriend stays home and you enjoy 7 days with your family. I have a feeling that you are going to learn a lot about him when you return.", "No, NTA. But your boyfriend sounds like one\u2026", "I feel like this should be higher. I hope op sees it. You laid it out nice and succinctly.", "Yes this was conversation we had long before he decided to move here and get a large house. I was upfront with my struggles and he was reassuring. I even asked him for $100 off of rent this month since it is really rough for me. He allowed it but then threw that also in my face this last argument.", "Sweetheart, a partner should not be \"letting\" you do anything. You get to suggest, he gets to decide whether or not to join you, but you don't need permission from him. He is being controlling and treating you as though you are answerable to him, not his partner.", "Oh honey, he is financially abusing you. Go visit your family without him, and make it a one way ticket, because you're only 6mo in, and he's already a control freak. This is gonna get so much worse.", "He does not get to decide how you spend money your mother gave you. You are NTA. Also please go without him and maybe think about staying there?", "Why is he asking for your meager money when he makes 5 times as much as you do?\n\nSeems like this is a control issue.\n\n> actually raised his voice at me for the first time.\n\nIt gets worse from there.. This relationship isn\u2019t going to improve OP.", "Also seeing how he makes 5x more than you. Everything should really be split (80/20). Otherwise you boyfriend should be downsizing his lifestyle so you can afford to live the way normally would without him.", "You don\u2019t have the money, there is nothing wrong with not being able to afford something.  You haven\u2019t been home in 2 years, go spend some quality time with your family!  If he wants to spend his money on things that\u2019s his business but don\u2019t let him try to guilt you into making this trip home about him.  You\u2019ve only been together 6 months, a week apart would be healthy at almost any stage in a relationship.  Go enjoy your time at home with your family.  If he wants to join you so badly he can do it on his own dime, you aren\u2019t a less caring person or a worse girlfriend for not being able to afford to pay his way too, or travel home his way ($$ hotel).  If he got angry at you over this and is trying to guilt and pressure you into making it about him I would consider that a big red flag.  I don\u2019t know the whole situation, don\u2019t know either of you, but that specific detail to me is a bad sign.  You are NTA in the least.", "These are all HUGE red flags...please tell me you're not thinking of marrying him? Actually his behaviors should be telling you to R-U-N.\n\nI've been there and please please please listen to your gut. If it's telling you something is wrong, IT IS.\n\nYou deserve better. Please update us.", "It\u2019s only been 6 months. Leave his ass. You deserve better, go have fun with your family!", "You are going home to visit your family. If your boyfriend *chooses* to accompany you, he can sort himself out, since you alone will not incur these extra costs. Or, he can simply stay the hell home. He sounds manipulative and controlling. Please don\u2019t let this sucky man affect your trip home, please don\u2019t miss out on time/enjoyment with your family & friends because of him. NTA", "It sounds like your boyfriend doesn\u2019t want you visiting your family, and that\u2019s really scary. Please be aware that him making this trip difficult for you may be a sign that he is trying to keep you isolated from them. He doesn\u2019t want to go, but he doesn\u2019t want you to go without him. Then he doesn\u2019t want to stay with your family or friends, and is concerned you\u2019re prioritizing seeing your loved ones over doing touristy stuff with him? Be careful with this relationship.", "And she\u2019s paying 40% of luxury travel/accommodations, so it\u2019s way more than she would realistically need to spend if she was booking cheaper hotels and economy flights.", "Probably why he went younger. Usually the case.", "20 years here and same.", "Also isolating. She can't go unless he goes? Controlling, here's how long you can stay, and give me any extra money you might have so you can't actually enjoy yourself.", "Do you not already feel trapped? \n\nI don\u2019t mean to be insensitive, but what you\u2019re describing does not sound like a healthy relationship dynamic. Making all the decisions and raising his voice at you when you advocate for yourself is him taking advantage of your willingness to be accommodating. \n\nDo not set yourself on fire to keep this man warm, he would not do the same for you.", "Nah, OP\u2019s boyfriend likes luxury travel and complains about anything that isn\u2019t first class flights and $250 a night hotels. He is forcing her to live beyond her means and expects her to contribute to vacations that are unnecessarily expensive. A guest room at a friend\u2019s isn\u2019t good enough, so OP should be forced to spend hundreds she doesn\u2019t have just so he can feel pampered at a hotel? Nope", "Your last paragraph is everything. This will be your entire relationship. What he wants. Or tantrums and guilt. Don\u2019t waste more of your time for this will happen again. And again.", "Have you considered going to visit your mom and brother and just not going back? This dude is bad news", "What he's planned and wanted is for you to not have a support system with your family and friends. He doesn't want you to see your mom. If you don't leave him when your contract ends, he will talk you into staying with him as a SAHW and then you will be a prisoner. I mean, you are basically a prisoner now, but at least now you can get out, in spite of him financially abusing you. Just wait until you depend on him for all expenses after your savings run out.\n\nHe doesn't want you to be out of his sight for a second, which is why he is being so difficult. I bet if you actually do visit your mom, he will never let the two of you be alone together.", "If your boyfriend weren\u2019t exhibiting lots of other red flags about being controlling, then I would have a bit of sympathy for him not wanting to stay with strangers in their one-bedroom home. But he IS waving all the red flags. Your mom is giving you a big chunk of money so that you can travel home to visit her. What are the chances that your controlling boyfriend starts dragging his feet about leaving the hotel once you\u2019re there, saying you can\u2019t leave to visit Mom without him because he\u2019ll be bored or lonely but that he doesn\u2019t want to go visit Mom right now because he spent all this money to be here with you & all you want to do on your visit home to family is\u2026 visit your family? Don\u2019t let him tag along & ruin this trip for you. You\u2019ll be so upset if you spend your mom\u2019s money to get there & then end up barely even seeing them because your boyfriend guilts you into doing other stuff while you\u2019re there.", "For YOUR birthday he wants YOU to pony up an extra $400 because he doesn\u2019t like the multiple options for accommodations you had for him. Yeah I wouldn\u2019t want to spend my bday with someone like that either.", "He insists you come with him because he won't let you out of his sight. You've been with him only six short months, you two already live together way too soon, and he is already extremely controlling. Let me guess, you had a \"whirlwind romance\". That's how it always starts.\n\nThe funny thing here is that I don't believe he makes as much money as he says he does, or if he does, then he spends way beyond his means. The need for the $400 and making you pay your own way are big clues. I'm sure at first, when he was lovebombing you, he splurged on luxury, but that was just to impress you and get you hooked.", "My fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t make 5x what I make and if he did I would never have to pay for a thing. The fact that you\u2019re splitting bills 60/40 when you can barely afford it is terrifying; he\u2019s trying to make you live beyond your means so you depend on him. This man is an abuser. Please please leave him. \n\nYou deserve so much better than someone who is **trying to take your birthday money from your mother*** when he makes 5x as much as you and doesn\u2019t need the money!!! Would you let a friend be treated like this? Please leave him OP. This is classic abuse.", "Also if he makes 5x more than you, you shouldn\u2019t be paying 40% of rent. It should be a equal percentage for each of you. For example if you make $1000 and pay 20% of your paycheck for rent he too should spend 20% if his paycheck too. So if you make 1000 and he makes 5000 you should be paying 200 and he should pay 1000. That way you are both able to put money into savings, retirement, and fun money. \nI\u2019m betting he is putting a lot more money % into his savings account every month than you are.", "Yes! The part about him being mad for \u201cprioritizing her family\u201d on her first trip home in two years is really frightening. Of course she\u2019s prioritizing spending time with them over the boyfriend she sees every day! Dude sounds controlling and manipulative.", "Yeah, six months in and he is starting to exert his brand of \"love\" which is actually CONTROL, not love.  **OP** this does NOT GET BETTER.

The trips were all his choice, if he doesn\u2019t want to pay for her it sounds like she would understand and not come.   \n\n\nI\u2018ve seen this behavior from rich people before - they insist on nicer, more expensive things than the less rich partner or roommate would ever buy on their own but then also want to share costs \u201cequally\u201d.", "You know that groceries also cost money, right? Right?", "You're seriously getting worked up over a imaginary situation in your last paragraph.

You're already spending all your money keeping up with his extravagant lifestyle, and it means you are getting stuck living with him and he's showing his true colours cause you may not have another option. \n\nPlan your exit, please. You deserve better", "I'm guessing he's going to suggest you stop working when your contract ends. That way he has complete control over you. He is being controlling and it will NOT get better. I've been in a relationship like this. Toward the end, he tried to get me pregnant so I would stay. You should watch out for that as well. Is this the same guy who had sex with you without your consent?\n\nVery quietly, start planning your exit. Possibly speak with your mother or your friend about moving in with them.  Figure out a way to quickly pack whatever personal items you can't live without. When you get out, you're going to have to do it fast. You may have to leave some things behind. Is there an HR at the company you're at? You might go to them and ask if there is a possibility of you getting out of your contract, or perhaps working remotely for the next 6 months.
