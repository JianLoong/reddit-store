He makes 5x what I make. We split the rent 60-40 (me). We pay for our own cars and other shopping expenses. He takes care of all travel (3x a month) and food expenses. He loves to travel and loves to stay at nice hotels. \n\nWhen I wanted to travel to a specific place,\u00a0 he asked me to buy my own ticket. Which is fine since it's a place I want to go. So I chipped in for a ticket so we could visit my family. He wanted to fly first class so he paid the rest. That was the only time I asked to travel somewhere -- the rest where places he wanted to go. \n\nNow I want to go back home for 7 days. It's a bit far and I've been away for 2 years. I've went back a few times but usually could only afford to stay 1-2 days since it's so far which obviously is way too short.\n\nI asked him about going. He initially said no. Which I responded with, well I'm going to go\nMy mom is going to buy my ticket. Then he said ok. Usually when I visit home I obviously just stay with my mom and brother for free. They live in a small one bedroom. \n\nHe asked where are we going to stay and asked me to pitch in for a hotel. I told him that's going to be difficult since I don't have any money and my mom isn't going to give me money for a hotel. He usually wants to stay at $200-300 per night hotel (so x7 nights thats at least $1k). I offered my friends house -- she has a guest bedroom for free but he said he's uncomfortable with that. I told him I wasn't sure on what I can do because I can't afford to pitch in for a hotel. \n\nHe got really upset and brought up all the trips and all the money he's spent in the 6 months we've been together. He accused me of making him feel like crap and that my priority was only to go home and not spend any time with him. He said he always makes sure that we have a hotel together and that it's wrong for me to not also make sure he has a place to stay.\n\nAm I the asshole here ?", "created_utc": 1678255949, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11lobpj/aita_for_planning_a_trip_home_without_my_bf/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When you are in a long term relationship, enough that you think making a home together is a great idea, you need to be on the same team.

I understand that he makes more than you by a wide margin and you all are still a new couple with no engagement so I can see splitting Rent(though I\u2019m confused as to why you pay more.) Then you mention that he pays for 3 trips a month. Like we are talking what 15-20 vacations in 6 months?!? You also mention he likes flying first class. I guess what I\u2019m saying here is what is your vacation budget that he is completely fronting? Why did you decide to split rent 60/40 with him paying less? When you say he makes 5x what you make, are you making a decent income and he\u2019s just wealthy and much older or are you living lower middle class near the poverty line and he\u2019s just merely doing well? So I\u2019m saying you are also the asshole because everything here seems messy. Even wording it like you haven\u2019t seen your family in 2 years but you two have only been together 6 months, why didn\u2019t you see them the previous 18 months.

Assuming you live in a more expensive area than you normally would, rent should be calculated as of what you would have paid on your normal budget then he pays for the rest since he wants to love large. This is not a mutually beneficial relationship if you can't pick a destination without him getting annoyed.  He wants luxury, he pays for it himself.", "NTA, but think if you really want this relationship. Would you be better financially without him? For example, if you rent a smaller apartment or a room in a cheaper area, are careful how you use the utilities and what food you buy?\n\nIt makes sense for you to stay with your family when you visit, because that is the purpose of going there - to see your family. What are you supposed to do if you stay in a hotel - to only spend the night there and spend the day with your mum and brother, or your bf will insist that you spend most of the time with him?\n\nAnd why did you feel you should tell him how much money your mum will give you? It is non of his business. He just raised a huge red flag telling you how to use your mum's money, it is a very controlling behaviour.", "I'm a bit confused. You start off this post by saying you once chipped in for a ticket to visit your family when the two of you went to visit you family.   \n\n\nThat was presumably two years ago, because then you say it's been two years since you visited your family and you want to go again, and that's causing the argument with your boyfriend.  \n\n\nThen you say that you and your boyfriend have only been together for 6 months? I'm no physicist, but that timeline doesn't work under normal conditions.", "NTA. I'm over here wondering if he's a control freak.

The only thing is that my mother gave me that extra so I could obviously enjoy some shopping and food when I'm there. \n\nHe definitely made me feel like the asshole and actually raised his voice at me for the first time.", "No, I think he's paying 60% of the rent. But assuming it's a luxury apartment because the guy only likes expensive things, 40% of that rent is probably not doing her any favors either. \n\nIn either case, NTA. The hotel is a very controlling behavior. If she needed to pay back all the expensive trips and hotels, she wasn't told about it. And now that she wants to go home, she should be allowed to choose any kind of accommodations she wants, or that she can realistically afford.\n\nThis is absolute bullshit.\n\nBy that logic, she shouldn't be allowed to book an economy plane ticket either because he has purchased 1st class tickets in the past.", "Yes that's correct.", "I thought he paid more, with him paying 60 and OP paying 40?", "Hey sorry for the confusion. I have family in different places. We visited extended family out of the country (but we only saw my family for 2 days which was another issue that didn't sit right with me).

Honestly his stingy-ness is a red flag to me. He can clearly afford it. He just is punishing you for wanting to visit your family. Trust me you will enjoy you visit more without him. I\u2019d venture to say you\u2019d enjoy your life more without him. Yes you will travel less, but date someone who actually wants to share their life with you not someone who wants to force their life upon you and then charge you for it.", "My husband has never raised his voice at me in 12 years. 6 months in... this will get worse.", "Thanks. NTA, his behavior is selfish and appalling.", "You are probably right it\u2019s worded oddly because she says (me) but I couldn\u2019t tell if that means she paid more or was the 40. If he\u2019s paying more than he definitely seems like he\u2019s pulling more than his fair share given her lavish vacation life and the length of the relationship.", "Right? How long even are these trips? When do these people work?", "I'm lucky to take one or two trips per year, all within my state of residence.", "yeah but what if (for example), OP doesn't want to take 3 trips a month nor care whether they do, yet her SO keeps planning them and they keep going\n\nin the above scenario, OP goes on the trips because okay sure why not but she doesn't care and doesn't request them **YET** her SO uses them as leverage as to why she should (pay for X)\n\nIt bugs me because she didn't ASK him to spend all that money to take them on all those trips but he uses it against her.", "So, just because he has it, he has to give it away? Sorry, but no, that's not how it works. OP and bf are clearly not compatible. OP enjoys living above her means, and she's only pissed when bf doesn't want to spend money on what she wants [by mentioning that's why she asked her mom for money, and didn't discuss it with him]. Fair enough, she doesn't like this situation, but you can't both want to profit off of someone and be angry that he also wants to be taken into consideration when she plans stuff.\n\nHe plans stuff with his money, and she comes along for the free ride and all's good. When she plans stuff with her money (given by her mom, in this case), she wants to leave him home because she can't afford a hotel with him. She then proposes a guest bedroom when he insists, that she herself wouldn't nornally use, and he refuses because ofc, you're not comfortable staying with a stranger when you can pay for a hotel. He proposes she actually spends some of this money on a hotel, since it's clearly possible due to ticket price, but she refuses because she wants to spend it on shopping. How is that victim behaviour? \n\nIn short, ESH. Bf clearly shows ah behaviour by not accepting he's dating someone who's broke Af, but he's not alienating her from her family. OP is clearly an AH as she enjoys taking advantage of someone else's money but doesn't want to share any of hers, which, funnily enough, is actually somebody else's money too, in this case. OP likes free money and not taking responsibility to take care of her wants with HER OWN money. OP, stop being a leach and do more to afford what you want in life.", "I figured she was paying 40 because she put (me) next to the 40. It does seem unbalanced.", "Exactly! What is happening here?", "We literally have no idea and you are projecting your own biases here. We know he offers the trips and she goes on the trips. Sounds like she enjoys the trips otherwise they wouldn\u2019t be doing them. If she doesn\u2019t like the trips maybe it\u2019s time to break up because it seems like the guy LOVES traveling and has made that very clear and puts his money where his mouth is. Also why didn\u2019t OP visit her family in the 18 months before she met her bf? Yet now he\u2019s the villain when she is the one who avoided her family for a year and a half.", "If I haven't seen my family for 2 years, I am sure going to be staying with them and not in a hotel. I wanna be able to soak up every moment that I can. This isn't a vacation to go be a tourist with the boyfriend. He proposed to stay in a hotel because that's what he's accustomed to. She gave him options, and he said no. So he can either go and stay in a hotel by himself and do what he wants, or he doesn't have to go at all. I feel like he throws a fit if she doesn't do what he wants to do on vacations. She buys her own plane tickets, but because he wants to fly 1st class, he upgrades both of them. That's on him, not on her.\n\nShe's gone for a week, so her mom is giving her extra money to be able to get some shopping done and get food while she's there. That's not his money to dictate how she spends. \n\nYou're also assuming that the boyfriend doesn't offer to pay for all of their vacations. If you notice, they always go where he wants to go. So he really doesn't care what she wants. Here's the thing he doesn't have to go at all. He can actually go to a destination that he wants to go to and spend the money how he wants to. \n\nIt truly sounds like the boyfriend is forcing her to live above her means. Staying with family allows her to save money. And you're telling me that if somebody offered to buy you a plane ticket and give you spending money, you would turn it down?\n\n The only thing I will agree with in your statement is that they are not compatible."]}
