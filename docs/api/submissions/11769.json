He makes 5x what I make. We split the rent 60-40 (me). We pay for our own cars and other shopping expenses. He takes care of all travel (3x a month) and food expenses. He loves to travel and loves to stay at nice hotels. \n\nWhen I wanted to travel to a specific place,\u00a0 he asked me to buy my own ticket. Which is fine since it's a place I want to go. So I chipped in for a ticket so we could visit my family. He wanted to fly first class so he paid the rest. That was the only time I asked to travel somewhere -- the rest where places he wanted to go. \n\nNow I want to go back home for 7 days. It's a bit far and I've been away for 2 years. I've went back a few times but usually could only afford to stay 1-2 days since it's so far which obviously is way too short.\n\nI asked him about going. He initially said no. Which I responded with, well I'm going to go\nMy mom is going to buy my ticket. Then he said ok. Usually when I visit home I obviously just stay with my mom and brother for free. They live in a small one bedroom. \n\nHe asked where are we going to stay and asked me to pitch in for a hotel. I told him that's going to be difficult since I don't have any money and my mom isn't going to give me money for a hotel. He usually wants to stay at $200-300 per night hotel (so x7 nights thats at least $1k). I offered my friends house -- she has a guest bedroom for free but he said he's uncomfortable with that. I told him I wasn't sure on what I can do because I can't afford to pitch in for a hotel. \n\nHe got really upset and brought up all the trips and all the money he's spent in the 6 months we've been together. He accused me of making him feel like crap and that my priority was only to go home and not spend any time with him. He said he always makes sure that we have a hotel together and that it's wrong for me to not also make sure he has a place to stay.\n\nAm I the asshole here ?", "created_utc": 1678255949, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11lobpj/aita_for_planning_a_trip_home_without_my_bf/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You haven't seen your family in two years. This has nothing to do with him being a priority. This sounds like attempted isolation. \n\nGo visit your family without him. You may find that the time apart is good for you. \n\nNTA", "You are not doing this out of meanness. You simply can't afford a hotel. Your BF's accusation is unfair. You **should** be able to prioritize going home to see your family without him framing it as a loss to **him**.\n\nWhat also needs to be pointed out is that your BF, who makes way more money than you, has been using his money to make decisions for the both of you. You two are not equal partners, making decisions where each of you has a 50% say in the matter, because your BF's money also has a vote, and your BF votes with his money. But you both need to recognise that your lack of money also gets a vote. You can't afford some joint activity? Then you both have to go without, unless BF wants to voluntarily pay the difference.\n\nNTA Please read up on \"financial abuse\" and see if it applies (or will apply in the future) to your situation", "NTA, it sounds like you have a trip in your budget. \n\nSounds like y'all aren't very compatible.\nYou don't make enough to keep up with him, and he won't cheapen to your budget.\n\nYou gonna be comfortable with that long-term?", "NTA, you made sute he had a place to stay he just didnt like it. He sounds unbearable.", "6 months with your bf sounds 6 months too long! NTA. Go home by yourself and enjoy your family. You should not have to pay just because your bf wants to live the high life. Enjoy your family time without the narcissist weighing you down.", "I mean NTA. But this is a lot for a relationship that's only 6 months old.", "NTA you\u2019re allowed to go home whenever you want.", "It sounds to me like he's trying to stop you from seeing your family. \n\nFirst he said no. Then when it turned out you would go without him, suddenly it's non-negotiable that he's going with you, and you won't be staying with your mom, you'll be staying in a hotel with him, and if you can't afford it, then you shouldn't go. When you wouldn't relent he tried to leverage trips that he's voluntarily paid for in the past, and tried to guilt you for even wanting to see your family instead of only focusing on him.\n\nNTA and I would be very wary of this situation. Obviously I'm basing this off a snap shot.", "NTA\n\nIf you don't have the money to pitch in for a hotel, then you don't have the money. There's nothing you can do about that. Ask your boyfriend where does he expect you to find money when you have got none. You even offered a place to stay at your friend's place, which your boyfriend turned down. \n\nCan you actually afford to be and live with your boyfriend? Because his expectations of your monetary contributions are out of you budget.", "NTA.   Just say no to this hotel thing. Go without him.  If he has a problem with that, you have way bigger problems in your rship than this hotel issue.", "NTA  and why is someone making 5 times your salary paying only 40% of the rent. \n\nAlso WHY ARE YOU LIVING WITH SOMEKNE YOUVE ONLY KNOWN 6 MONTHS", "Nothing like someone throwing what he did voluntarily, i.e. pay for things back into your face.  Plus he has warped thinking by blaming you for making him feel like crap.  And what sort of uncaring, non-empathetic, self-centered d-bag would say that he's not the top priority when you are making a trip to see your family?  Plus him having another self-absorbed selfish and entitled attitude of expecting you to spend money so that he can stay where he wants.\n\nWhy are you with him?", " NTA, he sounds awful. You have a place to stay. He wants to stay at a hotel then he can pay for it. Honestly though just go without him.", "NTA. So you live with this guy and when you go home for a week he\u2019s pissed off he\u2019s not the priority?? And accuses you of not wanting to spend time with him when you visit your mom??  And he\u2019s unwilling to stay with your friend, and maybe make an effort to get to know her??\n\nYou say he pays for the travel - but it\u2019s in the condition that you go wherever he wants to go? He makes 5X as much as you but you split the rent 60/40??\n\nThis guy isn\u2019t interested in a partnership, he\u2019s interested in calling the shots. Go home and visit your family, let him stay home for a week on his own.", "\\> He accused me of making him feel like crap and that my priority was only to go home and not spend any time with him. \n\nWell, he's kind of right, but that doesn't make him right. Some things are not about him. What a child! NTA.", "NTA  \n\n\nHe uses his income to guilt trip you, keep you financial dependant on him and remove you even further from your family than you already are.", "NTA.", "NTA. You might want to reconsider the relationship. Your bf seems like the kind of guy who likes to control you, in this case by usig money as a weapon. He is paying for your trips to go to places that he decides, then throws it in your face. He tries to make you feel guilty about visiting your family that you rarely see because this particular trip is not about him for once. He tries to make you pay for an expensive hotel even though you offered a free option, knowing full well that you can't afford it. A lot of red flags here.", "NTA if he doesn't like the free accomodations then he has to pay, or not come with you.\n\nPersonally I'd just nope out of this relationship though as he seems like the type to bleed you dry financially.", "NTA. Go visit your family without him. I think time away from him would do you good.", "Him making 5x what you do and expecting you to pay 40% of rent makes him TA before we even get to your family or his travel habits.\n\nNTA. I'd reevaluate the relationship, this does not sound equitable.", "NTA. your boyfriend however, is. the fact that he\u2019s holding everything he\u2019s paid for/provided over you is insane. he\u2019s guilt tripping. he should want you to spend time with your family. and not spend any time with him?? y\u2019all already live and travel together how much more time does he need with you???", "Girl, you are NTA. Your boyfriend however? A major one. He's trying to guilt trip you over a decision that you have NO control over. I also think it's concerning that he's making a trip where you're visiting your family all about him..when all your other trips have been where he wants to go. How often does he actually listen to you? How many times does your opinion get any weight?", "NTA. If he wants to join your trip, he can pay for the hotel room. And you live with him - sounds like you get plenty of time together.", "Your BF is an AH, he can find his own place to stay if he wants to go with you!", "NTA\n\nGo without him and stay with your mom and brother.\n\nIf you bring him he\u2018ll keep complaining that you pay your family attention instead of catering to his needs.\n\nYou should also rethink wether his priorities in life match yours.
