But, you should (kindly) explain this in detail to your wife and insist that he needs more supervision and assistance than what you two are able to provide at the moment.  Can you hire at-home help?

You and your wife are the real problem here.", "I didn't even finish reading your post, you sound like such an AH.

Your FIL is a danger to himself and others in the kitchen and needs to supervised.  While you were harsh, I also don't think it is unreasonable considering the situation.", "NTA.
