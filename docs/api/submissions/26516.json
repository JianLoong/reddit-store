It breed resentment, especially if she can't pay you back (and the greater the sum, the more likely that is). Even if she does pay you back, it means having to put your own financial stability and your own plans at risk.\n\nHere's the thing: you *are* in a position of privilege and the kind thing to do would be to support her if you can. Is there any other way you can support her? Does she need a place to crash for a while? Is there anything you can do to help her find work? Even giving her a gift, like offering to pay her rent for a couple of months for example, might be really appreciated if it wouldn't disrupt your own finances too much (giving is always better than lending in terms of maintaining a friendship).", "NTA\n\nYou don't lend money to friends or family members. You give them money. If they happen to give you the same amount back, great! But don't expect it.", "You should only lend money to a friend you are prepared to lose", "How is she supposed to pay you back with no job? Don\u2019t do it, you\u2019ll never get it back.", "NTA. Don\u2019t lend her the money. She will keep asking for more. After 3 years, the excuse of the job market is tough because of the pandemic doesn\u2019t work anymore. If she can\u2019t find her dream job, she should look for other alternatives.", "NTA\n\nThere's every chance you will never see that money - or have a friend any more - if you lend it to her.", "You would be NTA, YWNBTA.  \n\nShe is only 27, so probably won't make much money even when she does get a job.  After paying for her living expenses and debt, how much is she going to have left for you?  My guess is zero.\n\nAlso, if she lost her job due to the pandemic, then it sounds like she has not been working for months.  I obviously don't know where you live, but there has been a major labor shortage in most English-speaking countries.  So I'm wondering whether she really couldn't get a job or wouldn't.  She may be holding out for a great job in her field instead of doing what she needs to do to survive.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that she doesn't seem to be that enthusiastic about getting a job and even if she does get one, she will be using all of her money to live and pay back debt.  You're not as mean as the bank and credit card companies, so guess who is going to be last in line for repayment.  You should expect that if you give her money, you will never see it again.  Anything you give her will be a gift, so make sure you can afford it.\n\nTo me, it makes more sense for you to buy a house because at least that way, you can offer her somewhere to stay and you will end up in a better financial position in future where maybe you can spare money to help her.\n\nIf you're worried about how to break the news, then I understand why.  Unfortunately, desperate people often apply a LOT of pressure to get what they want.  You are going to have to be strong.  Say very briefly (so there are as few words for her to argue with as possible) and clearly that you wish you could lend her money but can't.  Offer to help her by cooking dinner and inviting her to share it or by giving her feedback on her CV.  Go through her options,  Can she move back home?  Do you have a spare room?  Can she walk instead of using a car?\n\nThis may sound tough.  It may not sound like it, but I strongly believe in helping people.  But if you lend her money, both of you will end up broke.  Don't do it.", "NTA. Lending money to a friend is a good way to lise both the money and the friendship. Only do it if you are comfortable with that money being a gift, which in this case, you should not be", "NTA\n\nDon't mix money and friendships. \n\nIf you lend her money, the dynamic of your friendship will change. She will be resentful at owing you money. You'll resent seeing her spending money instead of repaying you. \n\nAlso, it sounds like she's up to her neck in debt. Interest will accumulate all the time and she'll just get into more debt with every mini-emergency that hits her. \n\nShe needs proper financial advice. Maybe you could pay for a financial advisor for her, as a gift (it will cost less in the long run than giving her half your life savings)? Can she consolidate debt, can she get it written off, is bankruptcy an option, should she change career or move to an area with more opportunities, can she sell assets, etc.", "NTA - Your friend is one of those who is waiting for her dream job in her field of study, probably an obscure one?  There are plenty of jobs out there in this economy, just maybe not the ones that check of all the boxes, but when you need to eat and pay bills, you take.  She needs to quit blaming the pandemic and other really non-factors in her job search.  Get a decent job, maybe not to her liking that will pay the bills and she won't have to depend on you or anyone else.  In other words she need to begin acting as an adult, she is not a kid anymore.", "NTA. Depends on what amount is in question. However, you cannot be sure the money will be returned in a timely fashion and then that friendship is ruined. Your friend is responsible for her own financial circumstances and just shifting it on you seems like a quick fix. Have you looked at a budget as a minimum?", "NTA -  your priorities are owning a home and this will set you back.  The job market is booming, and something else is going on at this point. I was looking for somewhat niche positions and it took me a while, I still found a retail job to make ends meet while I looked for a role I really wanted.", "NTA, there is a difference between habing money and being able to spend it. While you may have the actual ammount she needs and then some, it's not spare money. It's tought seeing loved ones struggle but they momey you have is technically already spent, therefore you don't have it to lend. If youre able to lend her a smaller amount you can afford to part with indefinitleh then great, just because it's not the full amount doesn't mean it won't help", "NTA.  She can absolutely find a job.  It might not be in her profession and the job may be terrible, but she can absolutely get a job.
