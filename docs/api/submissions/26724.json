So often this behavior stems from some sort of trauma. It\u2019s fine that you said what you said. NTA. You get to say your piece. But how was he not in your lives for 4 years? Your parents shipped him off and it was like he didn\u2019t exist anymore? No wonder he hates your parents. They absolutely failed him. Imagine feeling disposable\u2026", "Info: Why was he no longer is your lives once he went to boarding school?", "i mean she is right you should have told him after the bill, so you were not forced to pay for everything, so if you are, only to yourself and marginally so  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. I had a nightmare sibling growing up and I often fantasized about them being sent away. If he wants a relationship with you, he needs to acknowledge the harm that he did to you and not just blame your parents. (even if they did have some fault in it)", "NTA. It doesn't sound like he matured any while he was gone. Consider the dinner a small price to pay to learn that he is still a jerk. Now you know not to waste anymore time on him. Enjoy your life.", "I don\u2019t think anyone here can make a real judgement. We have no idea the severity of your brothers actions, what steps your parents took before boarding school, if the boarding school was abusive, etc. Maybe your parents did fail him, or maybe sending him off was the absolute last option since it sounds like your brother was on a path to incarceration. There is so much more detail needed.", "NTA. I understand why you felt that way and why you felt the need to say it. I think that it was not the right moment and place for this, but at the same time he deserved it after all he have done. If he can't take a comment like that, maybe he don't understand all the negative effect of what he did in the past", "NTA - you have the right have honest communications especially as he still keeps up blaming your parents", "NTA ... however I will admit I'm looking at it through my lens and don't know his exact situation. But my 19 year old son isn't allowed in my home. I love him dearly but he isn't a good person. No matter how many therapists or how many consequences he won't change. Honestly if boarding school had been an option I may have used it. I just kept trying and trying until he hit 18.\n\nOnce he hit 18 i could no longer even try to get him help. Because he refused. He is a manipulative liar who 100% believes he is right and everyone else is stupid. He can talk a therapist into thinking there is nothing wrong with him. Personally I think he has ASPD, BPD, or NPD. All I can do is have strong boundaries. \n\nIf your parents truly tried and were unable to help him. I can see why they sent him away.", "NTA, he will not be getting back into anyones life if he doesn't quit the blame game.", "ESH sounds like there\u2019s more to it that maybe you don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think everything should be blamed on your parents but I also can\u2019t imagine that they haven\u2019t affected your brother in anyway.", "NTA\n\nWhatever the dynamic was between him and your parents (they were awful and didn't parent him properly or he was a demon seed and was uncontrollable) - it doesn't matter.  You were a child and your reality was that him being gone gave you a better childhood. \n\nYour parents and him need to work their own shit out. You are within your rights to set a boundary that you don't want to hear him trash them.", "Your parents sound horrible I'm going to send my kid to an abusive boarding school instead of actual parenting them.", "[deleted]", "YTA - is there an element of truth to it? Perhaps. Was it a cruel thing to say? ABSOLUTELY.  \n\n\nYou get to decide each day who you are. Do you choose to be kind, or choose to be an asshole?  \n\n\nYou could have just said that your experience with your parents was different - and better - than his and let it drop there. Then you could continue to talk and see where it lead. He clearly cares enough to make an effort to get back into your life. Will you be better off with him or without him? I have no idea, and neither do you at this point.  \n\n\nWhat I do know is that if you don't want to pursue a relationship you could close the door with more grace and tact than you chose to.", "NTA. I agree with the other comments that issues like that in children usually stem from some sort of trauma that the kid isn\u2019t properly dealing with. He likely needed help, not to be shipped away. But as a sibling, you were affected by his actions too and deserve to air your feelings. \n\nHow much older are you than him? I ask because you don\u2019t seem to agree that your parents are at fault in any manner, but he seems to think so. You have to remember that just because you\u2019re siblings, that does NOT mean you experience the same parents, per se. \nI have two younger brothers, and the youngest one is seven years younger than me. We had drastically different parents just due to the fact that our parents were in completely different places in their lives. Is it possible you didn\u2019t see what he experienced?", "NZA\n\nNot the nivestthing.

My brother was this way except my parents never did anything about it. He was always an entitled ass as a kid but apparently when he hit teens he ramped it up.

Once he was even dumb enough to shoot at the cops with a pellet gun when they were trying to arrest him for drugs. All before he was 18. \n\nHe'd never been abused or had anything bad happen to him. The worst injury he ever had was breaking his arm in football and the only issues he had was getting in trouble at school so the principal was always up his butt. \n\nMy mom would do whatever she though was necessary to help him. If he needed a doctor or therapy she was on it. If he was in trouble at school she was immediately in the office advocating for him. She didn't care if he was at fault and she was making a fool of herself, she was going to \"protect\" him. \n\nIt literally took him until his mid twenties and realizing people in the real world wouldn't put up with him before he started acting somewhat better.

Though 17 isn't a full adult, the brother was old enough to know what he was doing and how it affected those around them. If he was repeatedly doing these behaviors like OP suggests, it's only natural for OP to have the terrible home life they claim the brother caused. It's only natural for OP to have their own view unless they're given new information.\n\nThe brother stole a car. He should be able to realize that the fallout of that and actions like it would only be negative. \n\nThis situation isn't black and white. It's many shades of grey. It's not abnormal to have a child that grows up to be a delinquent that can't be helped. It's not abnormal for a child to have parents that neglect them and that's what causes the child to act out. It's not abnormal for a sibling to grow up misunderstanding what actually happened.\n\nOP and the Brother both deserve the same grace and consideration.

Not every kid's issues can be instantly solved by therapy, and a lot of the worst-behaved teens wouldn't want to cooperate with therapy in the first place.

So she is like half banned, she can't live at their home but she can come around and see them, but not us siblings (she cut us all off, it's better that way anyways) and they will talk to her.

Everything is cured by going to a therapist and \"getting the help they need.\" The fact that a lot of teens can't be helped until they mature doesn't impinge on this idea. A lot of people can't really be helped, either. Some are too mentally ill, some are just assholes. Getting sent to boarding school isn't a terrible thing for a lot of kids, as long as it's a real boarding school and not one of these \"troubled teens\" outfits. Someone I know has a kid who went from being a handful to being out of control to hearing voices by 15. His parents did everything they could for him, but I'm sure his brother and sister were very happy when he was in the hospital and not at home. He's an adult now and is in a vicious circle of being institutionalized, in a group home, or off his meds and wandering the streets. It's really sad, as he was a handsome, charming kid when very young. I didn't know his family well, they were friends of friends I'd see at holiday parties, and eventually they stopped bringing him, but teenagers not showing up with their parents isn't unusual. I didn't hear the rest of it until years later.", "Huh? The majority of US boarding schools are not troubled teen camps, they're mostly high end prep schools. I know a ton of people that went to boarding school instead of day school that were absolutely not troubled kids or abused. Troubled teen camps exist, but that's certainly not what everyone in the US means when they say boarding school."]}
