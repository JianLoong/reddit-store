So often this behavior stems from some sort of trauma. It\u2019s fine that you said what you said. NTA. You get to say your piece. But how was he not in your lives for 4 years? Your parents shipped him off and it was like he didn\u2019t exist anymore? No wonder he hates your parents. They absolutely failed him. Imagine feeling disposable\u2026", "Info: Why was he no longer is your lives once he went to boarding school?", "i mean she is right you should have told him after the bill, so you were not forced to pay for everything, so if you are, only to yourself and marginally so  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. I had a nightmare sibling growing up and I often fantasized about them being sent away. If he wants a relationship with you, he needs to acknowledge the harm that he did to you and not just blame your parents. (even if they did have some fault in it)", "NTA. It doesn't sound like he matured any while he was gone. Consider the dinner a small price to pay to learn that he is still a jerk. Now you know not to waste anymore time on him. Enjoy your life.", "I don\u2019t think anyone here can make a real judgement. We have no idea the severity of your brothers actions, what steps your parents took before boarding school, if the boarding school was abusive, etc. Maybe your parents did fail him, or maybe sending him off was the absolute last option since it sounds like your brother was on a path to incarceration. There is so much more detail needed.", "NTA. I understand why you felt that way and why you felt the need to say it. I think that it was not the right moment and place for this, but at the same time he deserved it after all he have done. If he can't take a comment like that, maybe he don't understand all the negative effect of what he did in the past", "NTA - you have the right have honest communications especially as he still keeps up blaming your parents", "NTA ... however I will admit I'm looking at it through my lens and don't know his exact situation. But my 19 year old son isn't allowed in my home. I love him dearly but he isn't a good person. No matter how many therapists or how many consequences he won't change. Honestly if boarding school had been an option I may have used it. I just kept trying and trying until he hit 18.\n\nOnce he hit 18 i could no longer even try to get him help. Because he refused. He is a manipulative liar who 100% believes he is right and everyone else is stupid. He can talk a therapist into thinking there is nothing wrong with him. Personally I think he has ASPD, BPD, or NPD. All I can do is have strong boundaries. \n\nIf your parents truly tried and were unable to help him. I can see why they sent him away.", "NTA, he will not be getting back into anyones life if he doesn't quit the blame game.", "ESH sounds like there\u2019s more to it that maybe you don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think everything should be blamed on your parents but I also can\u2019t imagine that they haven\u2019t affected your brother in anyway.", "NTA\n\nWhatever the dynamic was between him and your parents (they were awful and didn't parent him properly or he was a demon seed and was uncontrollable) - it doesn't matter.  You were a child and your reality was that him being gone gave you a better childhood. \n\nYour parents and him need to work their own shit out. You are within your rights to set a boundary that you don't want to hear him trash them.", "Your parents sound horrible I'm going to send my kid to an abusive boarding school instead of actual parenting them.", "[deleted]", "YTA - is there an element of truth to it? Perhaps. Was it a cruel thing to say? ABSOLUTELY.  \n\n\nYou get to decide each day who you are. Do you choose to be kind, or choose to be an asshole?  \n\n\nYou could have just said that your experience with your parents was different - and better - than his and let it drop there. Then you could continue to talk and see where it lead. He clearly cares enough to make an effort to get back into your life. Will you be better off with him or without him? I have no idea, and neither do you at this point.  \n\n\nWhat I do know is that if you don't want to pursue a relationship you could close the door with more grace and tact than you chose to.", "NTA. I agree with the other comments that issues like that in children usually stem from some sort of trauma that the kid isn\u2019t properly dealing with. He likely needed help, not to be shipped away. But as a sibling, you were affected by his actions too and deserve to air your feelings. \n\nHow much older are you than him? I ask because you don\u2019t seem to agree that your parents are at fault in any manner, but he seems to think so. You have to remember that just because you\u2019re siblings, that does NOT mean you experience the same parents, per se. \nI have two younger brothers, and the youngest one is seven years younger than me. We had drastically different parents just due to the fact that our parents were in completely different places in their lives. Is it possible you didn\u2019t see what he experienced?", "NZA\n\nNot the nivestthing. But him storming ojt and leaving you with the bill would show to me that he hasnt changed, really. \nMaybe view this as a sort of test he just failed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is really common in my country most kids usually go to one in high-school.

I got my son all the help he needed, even driving to terribly far away places to take him to the therapist he liked, hospitalized him when he needed it, etc. Finally, I sent him to his grandfather where he continues to get the services he needed. My son never considered how his behavior affected his younger siblings. He was just angry that I sent him away. (Which he had every right to feel this way.) He is now 32 and is just coming to understand that even though he was never violent towards his siblings, his behavior terrorized them. I couldn\u2019t keep him in the house. I had to think of his other siblings. And this is coming from an actual psychologist. Sometimes you just can\u2019t win.", "A normal one, huh?

In the anglosphere we have a bad take on it, and (especially in the US) they have a deserved ill reputation.\n\nThat said, many countries out there rely heavily on boarding schools and have safe, responsible systems. We don't know where they live. We don't know what their systems are like. A normal school could be just that, a normal, functioning, safe school. They do exist.", "Boarding schools are fairly common outside of the US fyi.\n\nJust because most Boarding Schools in the US are those \"troubled teen camps\" doesn't mean its the same everywhere.", "\"Just\" is a big part of my heuristic on what opinions and questions to outright ignore.  \"Why don't they just...?\" \"You can just...\" are almost always espoused by utterly ignorant and irritatingly self-righteous idiots.", " It\u2019s just a normal school that you have a room at, is boarding school different other places?", "The one I went to was not in the US fyi.", "In the US, there\u2019s a nasty \u201ctroubled teen industry\u201d where parents send their \u201ctroubled\u201d kids to abusive camps or boarding schools.

They aren\u2019t marketed as \u201cabusive camps or boarding schools\u201d. They\u2019re marketed to parents like OPs who are at the end of their ropes and they aren\u2019t shown what really happens there."]}
