While he still doted on my siblings, it was obvious he favoured me. To the extent that when he passed earlier this year, he left me a grand inheritance.\n\nAmong it were some memorabilia of times I had with him.

My relationship with them had gotten better as we cared for my grandpa in his last years, and they did try to care more.

While in her social circles she championed equality, she was the most spoilt at home and demanded her share of everything. While Mike and Liz grudgingly accepted the inheritance share, Jane yelled, screamed, threw things, all but demanding that my inheritance be given to her. She even accused me of being a bastard, which was enough to get my parents to for once shut her down.\n\nFast forward to last month, when I visited the family house, I noticed a lot of missing memorabilia. I thought perhaps they were being stored away, but then found out that Jane had taken them with some of her friends. My parents were surprised I didn\u2019t know, as according to Jane, I had agreed to sell them to charity.\n\nI didn\u2019t say a word more. I contacted my lawyer and told them to charge Jane for larceny and I had the news spread. Naturally, Jane was extremely taken aback. Last week, my family called an \u2018intervention\u2019 meeting.

Jane needs a reality check. She knew exactly what she was doing - she not only stole from you, but she lied and manipulated others while in the process of committing a crime.

There, balance met. But I'm not there for the money; I want the items and the memories associated with them and my grandpa.\n\nJane certainly has connections to re-obtain the items. Perhaps by purchasing them out of her 'small pittance' of an inheritance as well?", "I had communication with the police. In my case, I was able to prove to them through my lawyer:\n\n1. The property was mine and that Jane took it (the inheritance will; my grandpa had kept many items for me)\n2. She did so without my consent (no paper record, even if she argues that I did so verbally)\n3. She did so to deprive me of the memorabilia (by selling it as charity)", "Part of them I have already taken possession of in my own estates, the most valuable and significant ones thankfully. The rest were in my private rooms back at the family house.\n\nIf there's one lesson I've learnt, is that any agreement has to be on paper. A verbal agreement means nothing. Besides, I take extreme care not to correspond at all with Jane, either verbally or otherwise. So even if the parents side with her, it would not hold up in court as I could easily turn around and play the game of 'he said she said'.", "Yup.

It absolutely is a thing, and depending on what state you are in the term is theft or larceny.", "You would have to call the police and report it, so I took that to mean he had the lawyer contact the police and file the report because they had all the documentation about the items ownership and their value. It's not the kind if charge where you call 911 and they show up with sirens and immediately put the person in jail, they aren't investigating a fresh crime scene and chasing someone, they would investigate more slowly", "The social circles.

Proper media does nothing.", "I should clarify; **each** item would be in the thousands **at minimum**. As one example of what she sold, I had a signed NFL player card that on market terms would be around $50,000.\n\nAs said, Jane makes the utmost effort to look charitable and altruistic to appeal to her social groups. By making a big charity donation with priceless items, she can most certainly use that to gain more standing. The biggest weapon I have right now is to target her reputation by spreading the fact that she was not just a larcenist but also a deceiver.\n\nAgain, I'm not in this for the money. I'm in this for the **memories** attached to so much items from my childhood. There is certainly vindictiveness in what I did. But my end goal is to get my items back.\n\nEDIT: Ah, the pains of a typo. u/NandoDeColonoscopy I had an extra 0 in the price. More precisely, it would translate to around $35,000 USD.

I d make her sell every single thing she has to collect money immediately to buy them back, like in 1 month, and parents can help if they think that stealing something from your sibling is ok but pressing charges is too much. \n\nAnd how the hell is petty pressing charges against someone who stole your things(worth thousands)!? \n\nI wonder if you d feel the same if it is something you value and you ve got from person you love, is taken and sold?\n\nMy 4y.o. knows he can't take anything from his sister without her approval, 18y.o. not just taking but selling stuff;  that's pure malice and AH move!\n\nOP NTA!", "Lol a year?

She deliberately deceived them by lying to their faces in order to get away with her plan.", "Additionally see how much the stolen items were actually worth.

They don't deserve you.", "Well she\u2019s the one who ruined the reputation by starting this mess in the first place. Actions have consequences, even for the wealthy. Use your power and standing to show her that.", "Yep - returning the items IS dealing with it internally...", "Love it!", "Which makes them excellent witnesses for OP\u2019s case, because they\u2019re not going to want to get in trouble on Jane\u2019s behalf.\n\nThey can be put under oath and asked about their role in the matter, and testify that Jane told them OP donated the items.", "The friends would have to prove in court they had no knowledge of Jane\u2019s intent to commit a crime. If they couldn\u2019t, they could be charged with aiding and abetting. It would be messy!", "I mean, from the standpoint of running a charity auction....Jane is bad. Like. Real bad. Because she sold stolen goods at a charity auction. That is ruinous for a charity.\n\nSo you should contact these charities directly and make sure they know that Jane stole those items from you and you are proceeding with criminal charges for anyone involved in handling these stolen items.\n\nThat will get Jane blacklisted real fast.", "You can give Jane the choice, either she gives you back all of the items (using those connections of hers and her 'small pittance') or you take it to court.\n\nThe first option would be best. Then you can get back those items with emotional value and she can save face in those social circles. So maybe you can try to pressure her by holding court over her head, but definitely make sure there's a time limit.\n\nIf she gives back part of the items, I think it's up for you to decide whether to be appeased by that or not. It might genuinely be hard to get back 100% of what was stolen.\n\nBut I definitely would not settle for Jane simply 'paying off' the monetary value without even trying to get the items back. There's a reason such things as paying for emotional damages exist. If she can just pay you the monetary value, she will have gotten away with dealing you an emotional blow, with next to no repercussions. This is not about the money. It's about her misappropriating the very last thethers that connected you to a person who has been deceased.\n\nLook at it this way. If money is the only thing that matters, if your emotions about the sentimental value of the items should not play a part, then neither should Jane's feelings about the potential blow to her standing in her social circles.", "So, the local prosecutor (not your attorney) is charging her with larceny?", "That said, civil larceny/civil theft is absolutely a thing in the US.
