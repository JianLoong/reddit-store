She's got a lot of fight in her - why is it there? What sparked that and why is it causing her problems? At the end of the day, she's a 9yo child that doesn't know how to regulate or process her emotions properly yet. Moving in with you implies there was a major change in her life recently. She could be acting out in response to this, so my suggestions would be...\n\nPatience and understanding, even when both your patience and understanding are being tested.

His way might take longer but he will raise a well rounded child that isn't scared of or resents him. \n\nMaybe the child has a condition that is making their behaviour difficult- who knows without more info from dad. \n\nYou do have every right to not want it in your house, you can ask them to leave & you can refuse to babysit but you have no right to discipline anyone else's child or tell them how to parent. Especially when they are doing it right- if you ask anyone who works with kids or social services they'll tell you your son's parenting tactics are entirely appropriate.", "I mean realistically I doubt this person would admit to that online even anonymously. I know people who still hit their kids. Some states it's illegal and some it's not.", "Exactly. NC is a massive step, no way he\u2019s gonna be comfortable with you disciplining his child now", "Other people are commenting that OP previously kicked him out at 18 when he refused to put his daughter up for adoption.", "She\u2019s posted before. She kicked her son out when he was 18 because he decided to raise his child. She then had nothing to do with the kid for almost 9 years", "that was me but it was a completely different situation. I already apologized for not giving her dinner", "it was just one meal and she had snacks\n\njust because I was an asshole in one situation that makes me an asshole for the rest of my life?", "I told her to do her chores", "True but I still think equating discipline to hitting is incorrect. That's why we have so many asshole people in the world, because their parents  thought discipline meant hitting. So they either disciplined by hitting, or they didn't discipline. \n\nI've had far too many students who had parents who \"didn't believe in discipline\" and they've been the most unpleasant little people to be around, for adults and other children.", "Apologising for withholding food from a child doesn\u2019t make it right.", "Way to bury the lead!  No wonder he doesn't allow you to watch his kid, you consider abuse an \"age appropriate\" punishment.", "It isn't a small mistake, and he must prioritize the safety of his child. Teaching her that food is a right that can be taken away is cruel at best, abusive at worst. \n\nI don't know how to say this without sounding cruel, but you don't get a second chance at this.", "People like you always say it was \u201cjust one meal.\u201d\n\nBut that \u201cjust one meal\u201d becomes lots of meals if it is used as a regular punishment. How many meals did your son miss?\n\nAnd let\u2019s not even discuss the implications of \u201cyou only deserve to eat if you\u2019re good.\u201d That kind of thinking leads to eating disorders in perfectionist kids", "Well, you\u2019ve been an arsehole in at least three situations that I know of, and I\u2019ve only read your words you\u2019ve posted on this and your other account in the last fifteen minutes.  \n\nYou have the opportunity to turn this around with your son and grandchild, but you seem to be more keen to be seen to be right in the opinion of a bunch of internet strangers, and to punish a child for things that are just a kid in a difficult new situation being a kid.  \n\nShe should not have sworn at you but you keep avoiding explaining what led up up her swearing.  \n\nSo I\u2019m far from convinced that you want to make things right at the moment, or to make things better in the future.", "No but it speaks volumes that you\u2019d even consider punishing someone by denying them food. YTA", "And were these chores approved by dad? What were the chores? And how did you ask?", "no I realized I was wrong.\n\nim trying to help him", "yes they were. just washing the dishes and cleaning her room", "Sometimes its not what you say but how you say it. \n\nEveryone else in the home seems to think she doesn't deserve to be punished yet you do. Which makes me believe you are leaving out some details deliberately."]}
