I am on my way to getting a degree in Chemistry, which will be relevant later. \n\nFor context, I have an anxious child who used to cry a lot and caused my parents a lot of stress. On the other hand, my sister \"Liz\" (19f) was always very laid-back and happy. My parents were always closer to her because, I will admit, she was an easier child to get along with. I did not make raising me very easy, lol. \n\nBecause of that, my parents have always been more involved in her life. I know that it's silly, but I used to get upset because they would always brag about her by putting me down. I can recall multiple holidays where their contribution to the family discussion was \"Liz is so outgoing and the star of her ballet recital! She's so much nicer to deal with than u/throwawaygeneric56. We nearly didn't have Liz because u/throwawaygeneric56 was so hard to deal with!\"\n\nEvery time I would get upset afterwards, they would tell me that I would be a lot more lovable if I cried less. I took that message to heart and I'm proud to say that the last time I cried was when my father called me manipulative 6 years ago. \n\nAnyway, my family had one of their routine holiday get-togethers, and I decided to try and be a good child and told my parents that I really don't appreciate it when they put me down, and they can brag about Liz but would they mind not doing it at my expense? I told them that I would not tolerate it and, if they started belittling me, I was just going to leave. \n\nFast forward to the dinner and one of my aunts asks me what I'm studying in college. I replied Chemistry, and then my mother said \"She's not like Liz. Liz is so kind and patient, so she's studying to become a nurse! She's going to actually have a career afterwards, ha ha\" and then my father said \" u/throwawaygeneric56 should have become a psychologist, then maybe she could get over her issues with criticism. Can you believe she specifically asked us not to talk about her?\" \n\nSo I left. I apologized to my aunt for making things tense and then walked out. I just walked home and proceeded to not interact with my parents for the rest of the evening. I will admit that I was very hurt by them immediately disregarding what I had asked, but I am proud of myself for not crying over it--I didn't get a 6 year streak for nothing! \n\nI'm just really confused. My parents and sister have been periodically shouting at the door to tell me how I put a damper on the evening and was acting really selfish. I don't know how to make myself likable, though. I tried not to get upset by communicating what I wanted beforehand. Why isn't it working? What am I doing wrong?

You deserved, and still deserve, better.", "NTA. There is NOTHING wrong with you. Your parents are absolutely awful and do not deserve you.  I imagine the reason you were anxious and cried a lot as a child was because of things they said to you and the pressure they put on you to live up to some ideal they had in their heads.  You are only 2 years older than your sister.  I can\u2019t think of anything that could have been so bad that they \u201calmost didn\u2019t have Liz.\u201d That\u2019s bullshit used to manipulate you and make you feel bad.  Babies cry. It is how they communicate their needs. Maybe they weren\u2019t prepared for that.\n\nIf you have the ability to, please see a therapist. If you\u2019re in school, I believe mental health services should be available through your school.  It took me 27 years to even begin dealing with the things my family did to me and I don\u2019t want the same to happen to you.  \n\nIf you take nothing else from this, please take this: crying doesn\u2019t make you weak or unlikable. Crying makes you strong. It is healthy. Bottling up your emotions isn\u2019t. Shortly before I started therapy, I had a total break down. I cried for an hour, shook uncontrollably, and just couldn\u2019t stop. That was 27 years of pain and trauma spewing out of me because I hadn\u2019t gotten the help I needed as a child.", "NTA but please consider it not necessarily a good thing to not cry for 6 years. Please talk to a psychologist. Your parents have been abusive all of your life and it has created some ingrained habits/thoughts that aren't factually correct. Crying is a **normal human response.** I too was called a crybaby and now at 40 I cry even more than I did as a child. But now I'm totally comfortable with it. My boys are used to seeing me cry (sad and happy) and know that it's normal. I recently found out about the concept of being a *Highly Sensitive Person** which has helped my perspective on life too. \nYou were absolutely right in your behaviour at dinner but I do hope you get some help to deal with the long lasting effect your shitty parents have had on you.", "NTA.\n\nThank god most ppl are saying NTA and giving you good advice/words. You were never and still aren\u2019t the AH \u2014 your parents are. Not only did they compare you to your sister growing up (which from experience is so shitty) but they also ridiculed you for showing emotion which is a totally normal human thing to do. \n\nI grew up w my fam comparing me to my older sis all the time, saying she was the better daughter/niece, and criticizing me for crying/showing emotions and it really impacted the way I grew up \u2014 my self esteem, the trust i had in myself, suppressing my emotions (which manifested into terrible anxiety), etc. Thank goodness I had good friends and access to therapy to pull me out of it. \n\nSo no, don\u2019t be more patient, you\u2019ve been patient for nearly far too long. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re enforcing your boundaries. You deserve to be around ppl who love and support you for who you are. Sorry, but you parents suck. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s them.", "NTA but your parents are.", "Please do not let these soul sucking vampires stop you from crying, it is such an important way of releasing stress/ sadness/ happiness/ anger/ onions.

There are many people in my life, who I love, who cry a lot, and their crying doesn't make me love them any less; I appreciate their emotional fluency and vulnerability, especially since that's something I struggle with, and people just react differently to things. The way your family treats you is awful, it's cruel, and they 100% made you stop crying because they know how cruel they are and they feel guilty, NOT because it is a fault of yours. You deserve congratulations for how you've survived that situation, and how adaptable you are--it's hard not to cry when you're hurt--but that should never have been something they demanded of you.
