I am on my way to getting a degree in Chemistry, which will be relevant later. \n\nFor context, I have an anxious child who used to cry a lot and caused my parents a lot of stress. On the other hand, my sister \"Liz\" (19f) was always very laid-back and happy. My parents were always closer to her because, I will admit, she was an easier child to get along with. I did not make raising me very easy, lol. \n\nBecause of that, my parents have always been more involved in her life. I know that it's silly, but I used to get upset because they would always brag about her by putting me down. I can recall multiple holidays where their contribution to the family discussion was \"Liz is so outgoing and the star of her ballet recital! She's so much nicer to deal with than u/throwawaygeneric56. We nearly didn't have Liz because u/throwawaygeneric56 was so hard to deal with!\"\n\nEvery time I would get upset afterwards, they would tell me that I would be a lot more lovable if I cried less. I took that message to heart and I'm proud to say that the last time I cried was when my father called me manipulative 6 years ago. \n\nAnyway, my family had one of their routine holiday get-togethers, and I decided to try and be a good child and told my parents that I really don't appreciate it when they put me down, and they can brag about Liz but would they mind not doing it at my expense? I told them that I would not tolerate it and, if they started belittling me, I was just going to leave. \n\nFast forward to the dinner and one of my aunts asks me what I'm studying in college. I replied Chemistry, and then my mother said \"She's not like Liz. Liz is so kind and patient, so she's studying to become a nurse! She's going to actually have a career afterwards, ha ha\" and then my father said \" u/throwawaygeneric56 should have become a psychologist, then maybe she could get over her issues with criticism. Can you believe she specifically asked us not to talk about her?\" \n\nSo I left. I apologized to my aunt for making things tense and then walked out. I just walked home and proceeded to not interact with my parents for the rest of the evening. I will admit that I was very hurt by them immediately disregarding what I had asked, but I am proud of myself for not crying over it--I didn't get a 6 year streak for nothing! \n\nI'm just really confused. My parents and sister have been periodically shouting at the door to tell me how I put a damper on the evening and was acting really selfish. I don't know how to make myself likable, though. I tried not to get upset by communicating what I wanted beforehand. Why isn't it working? What am I doing wrong?

Crying makes you strong. It is healthy. Bottling up your emotions isn\u2019t. Shortly before I started therapy, I had a total break down.

Largely keeping them safe and trying to create a little space in the world where they could let down their guard. What has *never* been hard is loving them.
