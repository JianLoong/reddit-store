I am on my way to getting a degree in Chemistry, which will be relevant later. \n\nFor context, I have an anxious child who used to cry a lot and caused my parents a lot of stress. On the other hand, my sister \"Liz\" (19f) was always very laid-back and happy. My parents were always closer to her because, I will admit, she was an easier child to get along with. I did not make raising me very easy, lol. \n\nBecause of that, my parents have always been more involved in her life. I know that it's silly, but I used to get upset because they would always brag about her by putting me down. I can recall multiple holidays where their contribution to the family discussion was \"Liz is so outgoing and the star of her ballet recital! She's so much nicer to deal with than u/throwawaygeneric56. We nearly didn't have Liz because u/throwawaygeneric56 was so hard to deal with!\"\n\nEvery time I would get upset afterwards, they would tell me that I would be a lot more lovable if I cried less. I took that message to heart and I'm proud to say that the last time I cried was when my father called me manipulative 6 years ago. \n\nAnyway, my family had one of their routine holiday get-togethers, and I decided to try and be a good child and told my parents that I really don't appreciate it when they put me down, and they can brag about Liz but would they mind not doing it at my expense? I told them that I would not tolerate it and, if they started belittling me, I was just going to leave. \n\nFast forward to the dinner and one of my aunts asks me what I'm studying in college. I replied Chemistry, and then my mother said \"She's not like Liz. Liz is so kind and patient, so she's studying to become a nurse! She's going to actually have a career afterwards, ha ha\" and then my father said \" u/throwawaygeneric56 should have become a psychologist, then maybe she could get over her issues with criticism. Can you believe she specifically asked us not to talk about her?\" \n\nSo I left. I apologized to my aunt for making things tense and then walked out. I just walked home and proceeded to not interact with my parents for the rest of the evening. I will admit that I was very hurt by them immediately disregarding what I had asked, but I am proud of myself for not crying over it--I didn't get a 6 year streak for nothing! \n\nI'm just really confused. My parents and sister have been periodically shouting at the door to tell me how I put a damper on the evening and was acting really selfish. I don't know how to make myself likable, though. I tried not to get upset by communicating what I wanted beforehand. Why isn't it working? What am I doing wrong?

Crying makes you strong. It is healthy. Bottling up your emotions isn\u2019t. Shortly before I started therapy, I had a total break down.

After years of that sort of mental abuse, you still seem pretty level headed for someone who was supposedly so difficult. \n\nYour family (aunt and parents) seems to have some warped expectations (re: nurse vs chemistry vs psychology). By the time your parents had Liz was probably when they got hit by a clue stick that whatever they were doing with you didn\u2019t work and therefore dialed it back a bit. \n\nOP please hold your ground. It\u2019s not you who is difficult. It\u2019s your parents.", "NTA, your parents sound terrible and they sound like they just like putting you down. Honestly, try to find someone to talk to because not crying for such a long period of time is not healthy.", "abusive treatment the word you're looking for is abusive.", "Sweetie, no, you have done nothing wrong. Your family are the assholes, and they are spectacular ones. It's not you who has failed - it's them.\n\nYou keep doing you. Finish your degree and get out as soon as you can and never look back. And if they never change, which they probably won't, go low or no contact. Your mental and emotional health is more important.", "NTA compared to the other family drama posts it sounds like you handled yourselves very admirably. Look after yourself and only deal with your parents and their issues when you want to / have the headspace to.", "\"Other people like me. It's just you three that don't\" NTA. OP, do not change yourself for them. No matter what you do, it will never be enough.", "NTA! Your parents are absolutely abusive. You should never settle for that kind of treatment. You deserve respect. Your parents were pushing you to do one thing to react specifically called reactive abuse, they tare you down so you'll react in a severe manner and cry then point out how horrible you behave so they look like the victim.  I am proud of you for setting boundaries with consequences and following through. I agree with other commenters that you should consider going no contact with your tormentors at least minimal contact. I wish you the best of luck with this, and congratulations on your success in your education. You're brilliant and will succeed in greatness, never give in, never give up!", "NTA This post makes me sad. OP bottling in your feelings and teaching yourself not to cry\u2026 only hurts yourself. People who put others down are toxic. You are not the problem. Your parents are the problem.", "NTA!! Absolutly not!!", "NTA- For a parent to develop intolerance for a child they chose to have because she\u2019s a difficult baby is insane.", "Your family's treatment of you is bizarre at best and just really awful, tbh.\n\nYou are NTA, OP.\n\nI wish I could adopt you, you'd fit right in between my 22yr old son who is a History/American History major and my daughter who is 18 and a Psychology major \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA. You never were. They abused you. Dont be proud about not crying, thats an incredibly sad thing. You should prob not be in contact with them anymore.", "I hate your parents", "NTA\n\nReading your post made me so sad. Please go see a therapist. Your parents were horrible to you.

There is no other description for intentionally working to shame someone when not merited.\n\nOP, what you did wrong was not react in a way that gave them the ability to say, \"See how she is?\"\n\nYour parents depended on you to do what is called Outrageous Overshadowing.  This is when someone is mean to another person, and the target person who was mistreated reacts in such an egregious way that his/her reaction becomes the focus of who misbehaved more in social standards. \n\nYou held poise, apologized to your aunt for the scene (fucking classay, by the way), and left without giving your parents anything to point at, in effect \"leaving them holding the asshole bag.\"   So they did what embarrassed assholes do--attempt to blame you for their inability to control themselves.\n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again:  nature abhors a vacuum.  As a chemist, you surely get that.  Your not being the proper scapegoat turned your family on its head in less than one meal's time.  This is what happened.\n\nMy sincere advice to you as her own family's black sheep is to consider going low/no contact.  Concetrate on you.  Make your own family.  Most importantly, love and care for Little OP, who still lives in you and needs all the love and protection she can get.  You will be better for it.  These people will probably go down clawing and scrapping to fill the hole you leave.  Let them.  You could not start the new year in any better way.\n\nNTA", "Are you able to go back to college early, leave that toxic environment, and go nc.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your parents are abusive. They have made you feel responsible for their struggles raising you, none of which is your fault, and taken every opportunity to punish you for not being the child they fantasized about. They have failed you as parents. When you return to school, access the on campus mental health services to help you learn that nothing you do will ever change they're attitudes because they're happy to have a human punching bag.\nOh, and also the screaming through the door makes me think they got told off after you left", "NTA. Get away from your horrible family, please.", "NTA.  But hun, not crying for 6 years isn't healthy.  Crying can be a way of letting emotions out.  You shouldn't be holding your emotions in just because they said they would love you more if you did.\n\nPlease, you need help.  And I don't mean that in a bad way.  I mean that you need to find a healthy way to cope with your emotions.  You need to know that crying is a perfectly healthy and good way to process emotions.", "Oh, OP, I\u2019ve read a lot of heartbreaking stories on here, but I think yours has pulled me the most so far and I just want to give you the biggest hug. This is abuse from your family. What they do and say to you is not the way a normal family works and I hate that you have been made to be so unaware they have been abusing you your entire life. You have done absolutely nothing wrong. If you were a difficult child, that\u2019s not your fault. Children have different needs and your parents should have understood that not every child is the same. They should have been there to provide you with those needs and I am so so sorry they weren\u2019t. You\u2019re NTA by any means and I hope all of the comments here will help you begin your journey to heal and help you go NC with your family. They don\u2019t deserve a single thing from you.", "Nta.

Your parents are toxic, and being with them is poisoning you through osmosis.  \nNot crying for 6 years is not an achievement on your part- it is straight up emotional abuse by your parents. \nHave a good cry- grieving the fact that your family is not what they should have been and should be.  Then make plans that make you happy. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA, in case you had any doubt.", "NTA! From a formerly mistreated youth: I realize the impulse to not cry again. I had a streak that went for 8 or so years beginning at 14. i encourage you to see if your college has mental health services and speak to a therapist about it. I'm proud of you taking steps to reduce the abuse. It's one of the only ways you could control it at the time. You've now proven that even \"polite non-emotional\" responses will not work for your family, so give yourself the pass to feel whatever you need to again. If you do not have access to mental health services perhaps find a trusted friend or adultier adult to talk to about learning to express that hurt in a safe space. Perhaps they are willing to sit while to have permission to cry a few tears and you can slowly learn how it feels to have loving supportive people who will rally with you through the hard emotions.", "Your parents are abusive, and they've normalized their abuse by blaming it on your personality. I know it's hard to be completely independent as a student, but you need to decrease your interactions with them and build up all positive life interactions. \n\nAlso, look at parent/child interactions around you and start questioning your family's version of events: were you really \"too needy\" as a young child? Every child needs their parents! Which came first, their rejection or your anxiety? Even if you were a \"difficult\" child, was their response to you really appropriate? Over time, you will find that good parents would have made very different parenting decisions, and you don't have to accept their self-serving versions of reality or of you.", "NTA. Not crying is not an accomplishment. It\u2019s a symptom of the treatment of your parents who failed you.", "NTA. The comments of your father to you are mean, condescending, belittling, disrespectful and emotional abusive. Your reaction to it was totally appropriate and mature.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to make myself likeable, though. I tried not to get upset by communicating what I wanted beforehand. Why isn\u2019t it working? What am I doing wrong?\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t working because your emotional immature parents are emotionally abusive and they are gaslighting you by making you think you are in the wrong all the time. But you aren\u2019t, they are.\n\nThis is probably hard to hear, but it\u2019s not going to matter what you do, they will probably always find something to put you down, no matter how successful you are in life. You\u2019re never going to \u201cwin\u201d this. And they already did a number on you, because not crying over emotional abuse for 6 years isn\u2019t something to be proud of, it\u2019s unhealthy. I recommend you to talk to a therapist to unlearn the unhealthy things your parents taught you and to learn about healthy emotionally mature behaviour.\n\nI haven\u2019t read it, but I\u2019ve seen other users recommend this book and maybe it can help you get some perspective: Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents: How to Heal from Distant, Rejecting, or Self-Involved Parents written by Lindsay C.

Your parents sure are. Crying is an expression of emotion that\u2019s 100% valid. It\u2019s natural.
