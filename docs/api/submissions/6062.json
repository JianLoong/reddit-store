{"id": 6062, "submission_id": "zzi43s", "title": "AITA For Leaving The Holiday Gathering?", "selftext": "I (21f) am currently in college but have come home to my parents' house to visit my family for the holidays. I am on my way to getting a degree in Chemistry, which will be relevant later. \n\nFor context, I have an anxious child who used to cry a lot and caused my parents a lot of stress. On the other hand, my sister \"Liz\" (19f) was always very laid-back and happy. My parents were always closer to her because, I will admit, she was an easier child to get along with. I did not make raising me very easy, lol. \n\nBecause of that, my parents have always been more involved in her life. I know that it's silly, but I used to get upset because they would always brag about her by putting me down. I can recall multiple holidays where their contribution to the family discussion was \"Liz is so outgoing and the star of her ballet recital! She's so much nicer to deal with than u/throwawaygeneric56. We nearly didn't have Liz because u/throwawaygeneric56 was so hard to deal with!\"\n\nEvery time I would get upset afterwards, they would tell me that I would be a lot more lovable if I cried less. I took that message to heart and I'm proud to say that the last time I cried was when my father called me manipulative 6 years ago. \n\nAnyway, my family had one of their routine holiday get-togethers, and I decided to try and be a good child and told my parents that I really don't appreciate it when they put me down, and they can brag about Liz but would they mind not doing it at my expense? I told them that I would not tolerate it and, if they started belittling me, I was just going to leave. \n\nFast forward to the dinner and one of my aunts asks me what I'm studying in college. I replied Chemistry, and then my mother said \"She's not like Liz. Liz is so kind and patient, so she's studying to become a nurse! She's going to actually have a career afterwards, ha ha\" and then my father said \" u/throwawaygeneric56 should have become a psychologist, then maybe she could get over her issues with criticism. Can you believe she specifically asked us not to talk about her?\" \n\nSo I left. I apologized to my aunt for making things tense and then walked out. I just walked home and proceeded to not interact with my parents for the rest of the evening. I will admit that I was very hurt by them immediately disregarding what I had asked, but I am proud of myself for not crying over it--I didn't get a 6 year streak for nothing! \n\nI'm just really confused. My parents and sister have been periodically shouting at the door to tell me how I put a damper on the evening and was acting really selfish. I don't know how to make myself likable, though. I tried not to get upset by communicating what I wanted beforehand. Why isn't it working? What am I doing wrong? AITA--should I have just been more patient?", "created_utc": 1672451402, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzi43s/aita_for_leaving_the_holiday_gathering/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are NTA. You were never the asshole. You had every right to be upset by that weird treatment. You haven\u2019t cried since you were 15? Your parents have failed you at every juncture of your life and you don\u2019t owe them shit in the way of explanation at this point", "NTA. You are doing everything right! What you are experiencing from them right now is called an \"extinction burst\": when you warn of the consequence for their bad behavior, then actually carry out that consequence, the first reaction from people used to walking all over you is a sudden burst of that bad behavior. You didn't react like they expected, so they're doubling down to see if you fold. \n\nThis is crucial: do not give in at this moment. If you do, all they will learn is that you now need even MORE mistreatment to be kept in line. \n\nHold firm through the tantrums they throw. Once they calm down, then you get to remind them: you warned them very clearly what you would do and then you did it. They should be proud of a kid who follows through.", "NTA\n\nYour parents randomly butted into your conversation with your aunt, just to roast you no less.

You made a very reasonable request and set out what you would do if it was acted against. They acted against it, so you simply removed yourself as you said you were going to.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA here. And not only did they belittle you, they *followed you home to scream on your doorstep?* Don't suffer that lightly. At the very least, don't go into their environments for a long time.\n\nI'm honestly proud of you for how you handled it.", "NTA and I'm sorry that you need to be told this, but you're allowed to cry. It's healthy when you need that release.\n\nComparing siblings is never pleasant but when it's done by the parents? No. You're perfectly fair in saying that they can compliment your sister without speaking about you negatively.", "So sorry for what you've be subjected to. You're NTA but your parents are.", "NTA.  So many postings of cruel and vicious family members on this sub!  My family sometimes has drama; sometimes people argue.  No one has ever been purposely cruel.  Do you have to be with them, OP?  Are you dependent on them for housing or cost of schooling?  If not, just go NC.  Let your perfect fucking sister take care of them.", "NTA.

In fact, you did everything right - they\u2019re so used to flogging you in every conversation that they keep doing it.\n\nLeave every single time.

Xmas is supposed to be for gathering to enjoy each other's company not to roast them.", "NTA. It's not your job as a child to make your parents life easy to raise you.

Don't apologize for things you didn't cause.", "NTA. your parents are not good people and you should not be in a position where you think six years without crying is an achievement. you deserve to express your emotions. you deserve space to be upset. im sorry they have convinced you otherwise.", "NTA!!!!\n\nIt sounds like you could use a break from your family. They are emotionally abusive and you have every right to cry. Your father should never have said that to you. A parent\u2019s job is to help you achieve positive mental health, not tell you that your struggles with mental health (anxiety) make you less than.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had to deal with incompetent parents for so long. I highly recommend seeking therapy and taking some space from your relationships with them for a few months at least. I had to do the same around your age and I am so glad I did.\n\nI also highly recommend listening to Matilda by Harry Styles and allowing yourself to break your no-cry streak. You deserved, and still deserve, better.", "NTA. There is NOTHING wrong with you. Your parents are absolutely awful and do not deserve you.  I imagine the reason you were anxious and cried a lot as a child was because of things they said to you and the pressure they put on you to live up to some ideal they had in their heads.  You are only 2 years older than your sister.  I can\u2019t think of anything that could have been so bad that they \u201calmost didn\u2019t have Liz.\u201d That\u2019s bullshit used to manipulate you and make you feel bad.  Babies cry. It is how they communicate their needs. Maybe they weren\u2019t prepared for that.\n\nIf you have the ability to, please see a therapist. If you\u2019re in school, I believe mental health services should be available through your school.  It took me 27 years to even begin dealing with the things my family did to me and I don\u2019t want the same to happen to you.  \n\nIf you take nothing else from this, please take this: crying doesn\u2019t make you weak or unlikable. Crying makes you strong. It is healthy. Bottling up your emotions isn\u2019t. Shortly before I started therapy, I had a total break down. I cried for an hour, shook uncontrollably, and just couldn\u2019t stop. That was 27 years of pain and trauma spewing out of me because I hadn\u2019t gotten the help I needed as a child.", "NTA but please consider it not necessarily a good thing to not cry for 6 years. Please talk to a psychologist. Your parents have been abusive all of your life and it has created some ingrained habits/thoughts that aren't factually correct. Crying is a **normal human response.** I too was called a crybaby and now at 40 I cry even more than I did as a child. But now I'm totally comfortable with it. My boys are used to seeing me cry (sad and happy) and know that it's normal. I recently found out about the concept of being a *Highly Sensitive Person** which has helped my perspective on life too. \nYou were absolutely right in your behaviour at dinner but I do hope you get some help to deal with the long lasting effect your shitty parents have had on you.", "NTA.\n\nThank god most ppl are saying NTA and giving you good advice/words. You were never and still aren\u2019t the AH \u2014 your parents are. Not only did they compare you to your sister growing up (which from experience is so shitty) but they also ridiculed you for showing emotion which is a totally normal human thing to do. \n\nI grew up w my fam comparing me to my older sis all the time, saying she was the better daughter/niece, and criticizing me for crying/showing emotions and it really impacted the way I grew up \u2014 my self esteem, the trust i had in myself, suppressing my emotions (which manifested into terrible anxiety), etc. Thank goodness I had good friends and access to therapy to pull me out of it. \n\nSo no, don\u2019t be more patient, you\u2019ve been patient for nearly far too long. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re enforcing your boundaries. You deserve to be around ppl who love and support you for who you are. Sorry, but you parents suck. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s them.", "NTA but your parents are.", "Please do not let these soul sucking vampires stop you from crying, it is such an important way of releasing stress/ sadness/ happiness/ anger/ onions. I hope you can release it in healthy ways if you must stop crying. Your family sound awful to you, I'm so sorry. Nta.", "I have two kids. The older has been much harder to deal with. He seems to feel things more intensely, and emotions - even positive ones! - really rock him in a way they don\u2019t rock the younger guy.\n\nBut - that\u2019s just the way he was born. It\u2019s been our challenge - with lots of mistakes along the way - to figure out the best ways to help him process stuff. And I\u2019m so, so proud that as he approaches his tween years, he\u2019s found his own equilibrium.\n\nYour parents are incredibly wrong to shame you, to compare you to your sister, to mock you, and to take a pass on the actual work of parenting their kid. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry.
