I am on my way to getting a degree in Chemistry, which will be relevant later. \n\nFor context, I have an anxious child who used to cry a lot and caused my parents a lot of stress. On the other hand, my sister \"Liz\" (19f) was always very laid-back and happy. My parents were always closer to her because, I will admit, she was an easier child to get along with. I did not make raising me very easy, lol. \n\nBecause of that, my parents have always been more involved in her life. I know that it's silly, but I used to get upset because they would always brag about her by putting me down. I can recall multiple holidays where their contribution to the family discussion was \"Liz is so outgoing and the star of her ballet recital! She's so much nicer to deal with than u/throwawaygeneric56. We nearly didn't have Liz because u/throwawaygeneric56 was so hard to deal with!\"\n\nEvery time I would get upset afterwards, they would tell me that I would be a lot more lovable if I cried less. I took that message to heart and I'm proud to say that the last time I cried was when my father called me manipulative 6 years ago. \n\nAnyway, my family had one of their routine holiday get-togethers, and I decided to try and be a good child and told my parents that I really don't appreciate it when they put me down, and they can brag about Liz but would they mind not doing it at my expense? I told them that I would not tolerate it and, if they started belittling me, I was just going to leave. \n\nFast forward to the dinner and one of my aunts asks me what I'm studying in college. I replied Chemistry, and then my mother said \"She's not like Liz. Liz is so kind and patient, so she's studying to become a nurse! She's going to actually have a career afterwards, ha ha\" and then my father said \" u/throwawaygeneric56 should have become a psychologist, then maybe she could get over her issues with criticism. Can you believe she specifically asked us not to talk about her?\" \n\nSo I left. I apologized to my aunt for making things tense and then walked out. I just walked home and proceeded to not interact with my parents for the rest of the evening. I will admit that I was very hurt by them immediately disregarding what I had asked, but I am proud of myself for not crying over it--I didn't get a 6 year streak for nothing! \n\nI'm just really confused. My parents and sister have been periodically shouting at the door to tell me how I put a damper on the evening and was acting really selfish. I don't know how to make myself likable, though. I tried not to get upset by communicating what I wanted beforehand. Why isn't it working? What am I doing wrong?

Crying makes you strong. It is healthy. Bottling up your emotions isn\u2019t. Shortly before I started therapy, I had a total break down.

Their behavior despite you setting boundaries make me think that your parents were absolute failures as parents and then blamed their failures on you. And THEY were the manipulative ones by making you believe you were the one at fault. After years of that sort of mental abuse, you still seem pretty level headed for someone who was supposedly so difficult. \n\nYour family (aunt and parents) seems to have some warped expectations (re: nurse vs chemistry vs psychology). By the time your parents had Liz was probably when they got hit by a clue stick that whatever they were doing with you didn\u2019t work and therefore dialed it back a bit. \n\nOP please hold your ground. It\u2019s not you who is difficult. It\u2019s your parents.", "NTA, your parents sound terrible and they sound like they just like putting you down. Honestly, try to find someone to talk to because not crying for such a long period of time is not healthy.", "abusive treatment the word you're looking for is abusive.", "Sweetie, no, you have done nothing wrong. Your family are the assholes, and they are spectacular ones. It's not you who has failed - it's them.\n\nYou keep doing you. Finish your degree and get out as soon as you can and never look back. And if they never change, which they probably won't, go low or no contact. Your mental and emotional health is more important.", "NTA compared to the other family drama posts it sounds like you handled yourselves very admirably. Look after yourself and only deal with your parents and their issues when you want to / have the headspace to.", "\"Other people like me. It's just you three that don't\" NTA. OP, do not change yourself for them. No matter what you do, it will never be enough.", "NTA! Your parents are absolutely abusive. You should never settle for that kind of treatment. You deserve respect. Your parents were pushing you to do one thing to react specifically called reactive abuse, they tare you down so you'll react in a severe manner and cry then point out how horrible you behave so they look like the victim.  I am proud of you for setting boundaries with consequences and following through. I agree with other commenters that you should consider going no contact with your tormentors at least minimal contact. I wish you the best of luck with this, and congratulations on your success in your education. You're brilliant and will succeed in greatness, never give in, never give up!", "NTA This post makes me sad. OP bottling in your feelings and teaching yourself not to cry\u2026 only hurts yourself. People who put others down are toxic. You are not the problem. Your parents are the problem.", "NTA!! Absolutly not!!", "NTA- For a parent to develop intolerance for a child they chose to have because she\u2019s a difficult baby is insane.", "Your family's treatment of you is bizarre at best and just really awful, tbh.\n\nYou are NTA, OP.\n\nI wish I could adopt you, you'd fit right in between my 22yr old son who is a History/American History major and my daughter who is 18 and a Psychology major \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA. You never were. They abused you. Dont be proud about not crying, thats an incredibly sad thing. You should prob not be in contact with them anymore.", "I hate your parents", "NTA\n\nReading your post made me so sad. Please go see a therapist. Your parents were horrible to you. You don\u2019t stop taking care of one kid just because they\u2019re harder. When you can, I would cut them out of your life.", "Yes.  It is.  There is no other description for intentionally working to shame someone when not merited.\n\nOP, what you did wrong was not react in a way that gave them the ability to say, \"See how she is?\"\n\nYour parents depended on you to do what is called Outrageous Overshadowing.  This is when someone is mean to another person, and the target person who was mistreated reacts in such an egregious way that his/her reaction becomes the focus of who misbehaved more in social standards. \n\nYou held poise, apologized to your aunt for the scene (fucking classay, by the way), and left without giving your parents anything to point at, in effect \"leaving them holding the asshole bag.\"   So they did what embarrassed assholes do--attempt to blame you for their inability to control themselves.\n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again:  nature abhors a vacuum.  As a chemist, you surely get that.  Your not being the proper scapegoat turned your family on its head in less than one meal's time.  This is what happened.\n\nMy sincere advice to you as her own family's black sheep is to consider going low/no contact.  Concetrate on you.  Make your own family.  Most importantly, love and care for Little OP, who still lives in you and needs all the love and protection she can get.  You will be better for it.  These people will probably go down clawing and scrapping to fill the hole you leave.  Let them.  You could not start the new year in any better way.\n\nNTA", "Are you able to go back to college early, leave that toxic environment, and go nc.\n\nNTA"]}
