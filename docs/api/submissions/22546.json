My boyfriend waking me up while I\u2019m sleeping has been an on going problem. More so in the last couple of weeks. Here are some of the things he does: \n- Talk loudly/scream with excitement on his video game. \n- Let doors slam behind him when entering/exiting the bedroom\n- Turns on the light to find items like his vape\n- Repeatedly rubbing/petting my face, stomach, butt, and legs while I\u2019m sleeping. \n\nI\u2019ve explained to him multiple times that lately I\u2019ve been having a difficult time falling asleep and staying asleep. I told him the stuff he does above disturbs my sleep and to not do it any more. To please only wake me up in case of an emergency! He said he understands. To fix these issues he started playing video games in the living room and I close the bedroom door when I\u2019m sleeping. He learns to put his items in a memorable place or use his phone light to find it. He still rubs/pets me in my sleep which I hate. \n\nFast forward three weeks later. It\u2019s 12:30am. I had a exhausting day at work with horrible period pains and he knows this because I told him. I have to get up for work at 7:00am. Yet here comes my boyfriend shaking me out of my sleep. He says I need to wake up because it\u2019s about my cat. I jump out of my sleep asking him what\u2019s wrong. He proceeded to tell my my cat has been scratching his ear a lot today and his fur is going missing behind his ear. He thinks he has an ear infection\u2026. Mind you: I told my boyfriend twice last week that I think my cat has an ear infection but I have to wait until pay day to order my cat\u2019s ear medication because I\u2019m broke. He also could have asked me that before I went to sleep or the next day when I\u2019m up! So I told him that again. He says okay and goes back to playing his game. \n\nI toss and turn as I knew I would do. I can\u2019t fall asleep and my period pains come back on because I was woken up. Eventually he falls asleep. So I hop on the game and turn the volume up real loud, sip out my drink loudly, turn on the lights, stomp around the house and wake him up to casually ask him does he want to play the game too. He says that I\u2019m \u201cridiculous and petty\u201d and leaves to go sleep in his car. I said \u201cGOOD! I don\u2019t care! Now your dumb ass will learn to stop waking me up while I\u2019m sleeping!\u201d \n\nHe came back in the house but he chose to sleep on the couch. He says I\u2019m rude and that he will never concern himself with my cat again. AITA.

Fuck around and find out.", "NTA. Whilst what you did is petty and unlikely to help much, I completely get why you did it. Frustration and lack of sleep.\n\nBut why are you with someone this inconsiderate? It sounds like you have told him not to do this multiple times. He shouldnt have needed telling once.\n\nI think you need to consider how important this is to you and what youll do if he wont stop. Because it doesnt sound like he has much interest in stopping tbh", "NTA for now at least.\n\nthe relation seems pretty toxic since he isnt responding to you asking for respect, if giving him a taste of his own medicine doesnt help its time to consider other options.\n\nif the relationship becomes a constant trying to get a rise ouut of the other there is no relationship", "NTA. Does he have your consent to rub your butt when you're asleep? From how much you hate it, it sounds like he doesn't and that's troubling to me.", "[deleted]", "NTA he\u2019s clearly got no respect for your sleep. A taste of his own medicine will do him good (also as this is Reddit, make sure you sit and actually talk about this with him also)", "Everyone's going to say this is petty and two wrongs don't make a right but sometimes OP that's the only way people learn and I'm here for it! My husband has a habit of humming in the morning when getting ready for work even if I'm off that day so trust me I know the feeling of wanting to strangle them! NTA", "I mean NTA but he's kinda showing you his priorities and you're not it.", "If I thought you were in a regular mood and awake in the daytime and you did this, I would probably say everyone sucks here, but this is in the early hours of the morning, you're in pain, you're up for work at 7am and he's waking you up to tell you... the cat has been scratching his ear? He fucked around and found out. NTA", "First off, how are you 20, 21, and 23 all within this past month?\n\nSecondly, you have multiple posts about your boyfriend in your history.\n\nThird, feeding off points one and two, you both seem incredibly immature and borderline toxic.\n\n\\-ESH", "You were a LOT nicer than I would have been, I would have freaked the fuck out! Now, just to ensure that he gets it, do this to him every single night for a week. NTA", "I would get sad at my boyfriend for sleeping so much and I didn't get to hang out with him, but he has a really labor intensive job and also has trouble sleeping. A point of contention between us was him losing sleep just to try and hang out. My anxiety and personal baggage told me that I'd lose him and we'd slowly drift apart if he slept so much. I would also untintentionally wake him up when I just wanted physical contact.\n\nWe're now engaged and I let him sleep when he needs to because that means when it's time to hang out he is actually present for it and not just in a sleep deprecated state.\n\nYour boyfriend definitely was an asshole like I was, not taking into account your need for sleep. (Especially around periods, menstrual cramps are no joke)\n\nBut the answer should be you to communicate how much it is hurting you when you lose a lot of sleep. Getting petty revenge on someone who seems to not intentionally be waking you up lots is only going to stoke the fire and could start a petty war and that's no fun. Just make sure not to try and have these conversations DURING these moments because tempers can flare and that leaves little room for cognitive thinking. If you're like me and eye contact is spooky, sitting back to back can help couples have honest conversations while easing the anxiety.\n\nNTA, but could have been handled better.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA.  I have used a very similar tactic on my partner.  It worked.  Problem went away.  Overall a happy marriage for 46 years.", "ESH with him pulling 99% of the sucking weight.\n\nYou gotta have a serious conversation with him about this.", "Sleep deprivation is just one of the traits abusers use to control and disorientate their victims. \n\nYou \u2018paying him back\u2019 is an asshole move toward yourself. Your energy would be better spent researching traits of emotional abusers and see if anything else sounds familiar to you. \n\nIf it doesn\u2019t, then just know that making boundaries and having them consistently broken by others is a disrespectful act toward yourself and an asshole move by your bf. \n\nEither way, this relationship isn\u2019t going anywhere good. \n\nNTA - but only because right now you don\u2019t know any better.", "NTA. Although I\u2019m all for being petty, it didn\u2019t teach him a lesson and it will cause more tension in the relationship. He sounds unaware and he\u2019ll just keep continuing his patterns with no regard to you. The petty in me wants you to turn the breaker off before bed every night and have a special lock for it that only you have the key to but I know that will create more problems", "NTA. You were petty, but you tried to deal with it in a mature way so many times! Apparently that did not work, I hope he learned now.", "NTA. I\u2019d be so pissed. It\u2019s so hard to even be comfy on periods sometimes let alone fall back asleep after being awoken. I wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with someone so blatantly disrespecting and disregarding my sleep.", "NTA and the fact he is touching you while you are sleeping knowing you hate it is not okay", "YTA\n\nYou don't punish your partners.", "What he is doing to you is a form of torture.

Based off that information he is either extremely incompetent and you may want to look at other options, or you are petty and constantly complain or have an issue with him.  If that's the case, he's not the problem, you are.\n\nI had none of these issues when I met my SO when I was 20, 21, or 23.  Whichever age you actually are (another red flag).

Not good at all.", "Touching and rubbing your body without consent while you are sleeping, and on top of that you have told him no and he still does it, that\u2019s really very close to sexual assault.

I feel very very sorry for you right now but it may come to the point when you can only choose to save one of you. I would gently suggest you choose you.", "Gentle squeezes.  I never got any complaints about stomach cramps ever again. I got offered heat packs hot tea and left alone.", "Yes, I understand what you did, that's punishing him for doing something you didn't like.\n\nThere is no winning arguments or correcting behaviour with punishments in intimate relationships.\n\nI understand your feelings of righteousness about what you did, probably feels like justice was served.

So annoying", "Well actually to be clear he fixed 3 out of the 4 problems I\u2019ve been having with him in regards to my sleep.
