Horses are a part of my hobby, so I also make sure they are enjoying their lives and have ability to spend most of the time outside and not in the stables. It is also worth mentioning that one of the cats is 18 and has been with me since she was a kitten and one of the horses has been with me since he was 4 (he is now 25), so I always refer to them as my precious babies.\n\nMy sister in law \"Kate\" seem to have an issue with the way we refer to our animals, especially the way  I call my oldest ones. I have explained to her multiple times that considering how old they are and how long they have been with me, to me they are like my children as I have raised them, took care of them and looked after them when they were poor. However Kate still feels it is disrespectful to call them babies, as they are not kids and because her own children are not invited in our house and can't spend time with the animals.\n\nIt got worse this week as Kate wanted to come and stay for a few days in our house with kids and her partner and have \"winter wonderland\" photoshoot with the animals, as we got a decent amount of snow over here in the past few days. I have told her she is not allowed as her children are still very young and seem to be unable to treat pira with the care and respect the animals deserve, especially since most of them are rescued.

And my fiancee is on my side here, as he also cares about the animals deeply and have told his sister her kids need to learn how to behave around animals first and treat them with respect and care. He is also able to spend family time with them as we do different activities with them every few weeks.\n\nEdit 2: as it has been asked before. We do spend time with our nephew and niece once every few weeks and do activities together. It is just we are not comfortable with them in our house.\n\nBoth of the kids have been exposed to animals, they visit my MIL a few times a week who has dogs, however due to the way they behave around and to the dogs, her dogs tend to hide when the kids are there and refuse to come out.", "created_utc": 1678542536, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11oknf9/aita_for_calling_my_pets_my_babies_in_front_of_my/", "score": 1060, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My oldest one is perfect around kids and is a great example to teach them how to be around horses, as he is very gentle and friendly, but he is getting old and I don't want to risk him getting spooked by something the child does and injure himself.

My home is their safe place. It is up to me to ensure they feel safe in it. \n\nMy dog is also part Pit. With me he is a big ole goofball, but the only way he is allowed to interact with kids is when he is on a leash and under my control. That is for the child's safety. In part it is because of his breed's reputation ( deserved or not), I have seen what he can do with prey he's caught. And in part because he is a tall 75 pound doofus. He could hurt a small child without meaning to just by being silly.\n\nMy cats enjoy their peace and quiet in the house. They should not have to put up with that being disturbed by small children.\n\nAs for small children around horses, the potential for serious injury is scary. What would Kate have to say if one of the kids got kicked or bitten? I'm not saying small children should not be allowed around horses.

So you'd end up either completely unable to enjoy your time (since you would be constantly redirecting and correcting the children from interacting with the pets in a way which could cause a child or pretty to get hurt) or locking the pets away to keep them and the children safe.\n\nI have two 20ish lbs rescue dogs that don't like kids, and one who has enough issues warming up to adults. I don't have my own children to slowly, consistently, and appropriately get my dogs used to children. I'm sure as heck not going to try and use someone else's child who's definitely more excitable and less in control than normal because they are out of routine and excited about visiting. That's a recipe for disaster, and will likely end up with a bit, scratched, or at least scared child. It can reinforce the wrong behavior for the pet (who got left alone and continues to reinforce that kids are scary) and can make the child no longer feel safe around animals.\n\nI've had my nieces and nephews visit me and had to visit them with dogs in tow before. The time with the dogs out was exhausting, as we spent the whole time teaching, reminding, and redirecting the children and actively working with the dogs to keep them calm and comfortable around the children, so we wouldn't reinforce the idea that kids are scary. The rest of the time the dogs had to be put away in a separate room so the dogs could feel safe, the children could play how they wanted, and we could actually enjoy the company we were with, including the children.\n\nHaving pets that are grown, healthy, and both used to and enjoy being around children is one thing and it can be great  to have the children socialize children with your pets.

My 8 and 5 year old are also \"trained\" to be respectful of all animals and not harass them, and I *still* watch them especially around new animals to make sure they still behave safely and respectfully. Why? Because they're kids and they need regular reminders and help, and animals are whole beings that need to be treated right. I would 100% not allow uncontrolled kids around any animal, nevermind something as large and potentially dangerous as a horse (of course not saying the horse is mean, just the whole \"huge animal, small human spooks/accidents happen\" thing).\n\nNevermind the argument over \"babies.\" I have fur siblings at my mom's, I have a fur nephew, and my animals are my kid's fur siblings and my babies.
