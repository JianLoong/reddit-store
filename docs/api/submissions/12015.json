Horses are a part of my hobby, so I also make sure they are enjoying their lives and have ability to spend most of the time outside and not in the stables. It is also worth mentioning that one of the cats is 18 and has been with me since she was a kitten and one of the horses has been with me since he was 4 (he is now 25), so I always refer to them as my precious babies.\n\nMy sister in law \"Kate\" seem to have an issue with the way we refer to our animals, especially the way  I call my oldest ones. I have explained to her multiple times that considering how old they are and how long they have been with me, to me they are like my children as I have raised them, took care of them and looked after them when they were poor. However Kate still feels it is disrespectful to call them babies, as they are not kids and because her own children are not invited in our house and can't spend time with the animals.\n\nIt got worse this week as Kate wanted to come and stay for a few days in our house with kids and her partner and have \"winter wonderland\" photoshoot with the animals, as we got a decent amount of snow over here in the past few days. I have told her she is not allowed as her children are still very young and seem to be unable to treat pira with the care and respect the animals deserve, especially since most of them are rescued. Kate didn't like my answer and blew up calling me an asshole for comparing animals to children and making them more important and for not allowing her to visit.

And my fiancee is on my side here, as he also cares about the animals deeply and have told his sister her kids need to learn how to behave around animals first and treat them with respect and care. He is also able to spend family time with them as we do different activities with them every few weeks.\n\nEdit 2: as it has been asked before. We do spend time with our nephew and niece once every few weeks and do activities together. It is just we are not comfortable with them in our house.\n\nBoth of the kids have been exposed to animals, they visit my MIL a few times a week who has dogs, however due to the way they behave around and to the dogs, her dogs tend to hide when the kids are there and refuse to come out.", "created_utc": 1678542536, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11oknf9/aita_for_calling_my_pets_my_babies_in_front_of_my/", "score": 528, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then I read the OP's comment about how they act around their grandmother's dog. No way in hell I would subject my animals to their behavior! \n\nLike the OP my cats and dog are all rescues. My home is their safe place. It is up to me to ensure they feel safe in it. \n\nMy dog is also part Pit. With me he is a big ole goofball, but the only way he is allowed to interact with kids is when he is on a leash and under my control. That is for the child's safety. In part it is because of his breed's reputation ( deserved or not), I have seen what he can do with prey he's caught. And in part because he is a tall 75 pound doofus. He could hurt a small child without meaning to just by being silly.\n\nMy cats enjoy their peace and quiet in the house. They should not have to put up with that being disturbed by small children.\n\nAs for small children around horses, the potential for serious injury is scary. What would Kate have to say if one of the kids got kicked or bitten? I'm not saying small children should not be allowed around horses. Again, it needs to be under close adult supervision.\n\nSorry this turned out so long.

He was appropriately petting it's head, like he was taught to do. \n\nEven IF you allowed the kids over, it's not wise to let them mingle without CONSTANT supervision and guidance. So you'd end up either completely unable to enjoy your time (since you would be constantly redirecting and correcting the children from interacting with the pets in a way which could cause a child or pretty to get hurt) or locking the pets away to keep them and the children safe.\n\nI have two 20ish lbs rescue dogs that don't like kids, and one who has enough issues warming up to adults. I don't have my own children to slowly, consistently, and appropriately get my dogs used to children. I'm sure as heck not going to try and use someone else's child who's definitely more excitable and less in control than normal because they are out of routine and excited about visiting. That's a recipe for disaster, and will likely end up with a bit, scratched, or at least scared child. It can reinforce the wrong behavior for the pet (who got left alone and continues to reinforce that kids are scary) and can make the child no longer feel safe around animals.\n\nI've had my nieces and nephews visit me and had to visit them with dogs in tow before. The time with the dogs out was exhausting, as we spent the whole time teaching, reminding, and redirecting the children and actively working with the dogs to keep them calm and comfortable around the children, so we wouldn't reinforce the idea that kids are scary. The rest of the time the dogs had to be put away in a separate room so the dogs could feel safe, the children could play how they wanted, and we could actually enjoy the company we were with, including the children.\n\nHaving pets that are grown, healthy, and both used to and enjoy being around children is one thing and it can be great  to have the children socialize children with your pets.

OP, why did you originally say that the main problem is that the kids can't give your animals the respect they deserve? That may be true for the first two cats you mentioned, but for most of the rest of them, it sounds like your real problem is that *your animals aren't safe to be around children!* So if you've been arguing with your SIL trying to convince her that the issue is her kids aren't respectful enough, I can see why she thinks you're an asshole. Don't relax your rules about the kids not visiting, but if you haven't already, then please, tell your SIL the truth as soon as possible. Tell her that her kids can't visit because *you can't guarantee their safety around your animals.* That should get her to stop pushing it pretty quick, unless she's truly a monster who doesn't care about her children's well being.\n\nSo my ruling is ESH. Your SIL is still an AH for feeling entitled to a photoshoot and pushing your boundaries, but you're also an AH for trying to make this about their shortcomings as parents rather than your choices as pet owners.", "exactly. asking OP to allow her rescues who have a hard time trusting humans to allow little kids to \u201clearn\u201d how to respect them is asking for bites, scratches, screaming, and crying. and maybe a demand to pay for the doctor\u2019s bill.\n\nNTA OP. animals with issues re: humans should not be made into an empathy project for preschoolers.", "Yikes. Sounds like a tough group. Good call on OP.\n\nContext like this would have been helpful in the initial post.", "If the animals are the issue then of course kids should not be around them. Surprised their mom would be willing to endanger her own kids like that.", "You don't owe them anything OP. Your animals are not toys for her children.", "I'm just curious: what did the kids do to the dogs?  Were they purposely cruel/abusive?  I'm just curious because that almost seems too young to be really mean to animals, unless they've seen their parents being cruel to animals.\n\nI don't think you \"owe\" them anything.  They're your animals.  Just wondering if the kids don't deserve another opportunity given their age and likely not intending to harm animals.", "[deleted]", "Sure, when I was 5 I probably would have thought of a horse as a really cool toy.  But instead of saying \"you can't see the horse\" I think my family would have said \"it's not a toy, here's why, and while you can see it and take photos from a safe distance, you aren't old enough to ride or interact with it yet.  And you might never ride this elderly horse at all.\"\n\nDoesn't have to be all or nothing... \n\nThat said the request to stay a few days is a lot and the SIL does sound overbearing.", "\"don't seem to be willing to learn\" They're 3 and 5. \n\nI mean, you're NTA for calling your pets your babies and are not obligated to provide access to them at all. I just thought this was an odd thing to say.", "Yeah, agreed. It would be genuinely irresponsible of OP to allow her skittish, potentially reactive animals (many of whom sound like they\u2019ve had some past traumas) to be the sacrificial lambs here. This is these animals\u2019 home and that is the main place that they should and do feel safe (and by the sounds of it, likely the ONLY place they feel secure). Not only would it be a cruel thing to do to invite kids who are incapable of being calm into their home, it would also risk the safety of those children if any of those pets would become reactive. And based on what else has been said about the SIL, I\u2019m going to guess she\u2019d fault OP for THAT too.", "Yea, that\u2019s fine . She isn\u2019t interested in building a relationship with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s family. OP should acknowledge it, at least for her own self. \n\nCaretaking of animals and family relationships take work. OP wants one and not the other. Totally fine. Recognize that\u2019s the choice you\u2019re making, though, and don\u2019t be surprised if fianc\u00e9 and/or family make different choices.", "Their whole vibe is off \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Ya'll have horrible ideas about what family means. WTF a petting zoo? Half the time the animals there are not in healthy situations. OP doesn't like kids is the actual issue, and being passive aggressive about it.", "Of course they don't, and OP knows the animals best. I have a dog who everyone is by necessity advised to leave alone and never try to touch or reach out to - very reactive. I am not going to live in lockdown, my dog can be separated if needed. I continue to help teach my niece how to act around dogs, because she's not some random stranger and maybe one day does encoubter a scary strange dog - where to learn if not family?", "You can refuse because they are not treating the animals right and you would have every right to, but if you truly cared then there's ways to at least try to make it work. Did they come over ones as babies and then just left out? We don't know how often the kids are usually exposed to animals, but you could for example see if there's a possibility to work with the kids and some of the more \"stable\" animals to teach them how to treat animals with respect, how are they gonna learn otherwise?\n\nI don't think mom has done a good job either if it's as bad as you want to portray it. Since you don't elaborate about any of this I will assume that you have done your best and I can't call you an asshole for wanting to protect your babies.\n\n\nE: absolutely not ta", "Ya i considered that too and wanted to emphasize I can already tell what kind of person that is. Just wanted to play devils advocate because the writings kind of on the wall for this one. It would take a very mindful approach to find a resolution to this that doesn\u2019t end in pain. Doesn\u2019t sound like SIL will ever be qualified to instill these values. OP does have an opportunity tho specially if SIL wasn\u2019t there.", "I answered someone else about the answer to a path that doesn\u2019t evolve into conflict wouldn\u2019t be so black and white. There\u2019s opportunities for OP to introduce these kids to other animals while instilling values SIL may not possess. Nuance is hard to grasp these days when everyone\u2019s either good or bad and there\u2019s no in between. People are who they are and it\u2019s shit like this that just perpetuates divide. Just saying nobody has to always win or always lose in order to heal there\u2019s always a path to mutual agreed intent and reciprocity.", "Who said to let them run wild around her animals & let either the animals or the child get hurt?\n\nYou teach young children by modeling behaviors; you go slow; you do one thing at a time\u2026is it \u2018work\u2019; yes but it\u2019s not difficult", "Hell, I even talk to my plants. Most people form bonds with things, it's not weird at all. edit: Let me add a story I watched once in a documentary that I always remember as cute: American soldiers in Iraq were given landmine detecting robots. This one soldier was out in the field one day when the robot detected the mine and as programmed, sacrificed itself to save the soldier. The soldier was inconsolable and when told that he would be provided with a new detector robot he insisted that he wanted the old one repaired because that one \"saved his life\". Bonding with animate or even inanimate things is a perk of being human.", "I don't think that's too young, I know some kids start riding horses around 1 and there are special saddles for that age group. My youngest (2) has been around horses since she was 9 months old. It just depends on the child's parents to make sure the child is being safe around horses or any animals and it seems like OP's sister-in-law doesn't care how their kids act around animals.", "That's how you do it. Cats can be very difficult to photograph. They'll move their head at the last minute. You think you're taking a photo of their face and you get their butt instead!", "My husband and I, similar to OP, both work from home and have a ton of pets that we love and dote on very much and currently don\u2019t have plans for children.  We don\u2019t call them out babies, though instead of ever asking us or pressuring us about kids, my mother in law just lovingly asks how her grandkitties and granddogs are doing haha. Appreciate the hell out of it", "My sister refers to my cats as her nephews and niece \ud83d\ude02", "My dad asks about his \"granddogs\" :D", "Because the way she saw them treat her mom's dogs, she mentioned that. That's enough of a reason. Its not even anyones fault, she never blames the kids parents, she just set a boundary. NTA", "As someone who was never around animals as a child, no, you don\u2019t need to be around them to learn how to treat animals. At a certain point you\u2019re old enough to just learn these things based on being told rather than experience.", "No no, it's not her job to teach the children how to act around animals, especially if in that process a mistake is made by one of the kids and someone ends up hurt. It's not worth the risk. NTA", "How would she know they\u2019re not OPs kids, ofc they spend time together but OPs not gonna see every single interaction they have with an animal. I wouldn\u2019t want to take the risk with 3&5 year old around my pets either because if I see a kid pull my dogs tail itsssss game over I\u2019m gonna need you to leave", "Your vibe is pretty much steer clear so I guess that's understandable. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f", "They visit my MIL a couple of times a week and my MIL has dogs. Due to the way the kids behave around the dogs, the dogs now hide and refuse to come out when kids are around, and that's considering that one of the dogs is a \nfully trained service dog.", "I can totally get that! I agree, it would be great for OP and the kids to be able to get there one day with the animals but they should definitely not start out by trying with these particular animals and it sounds like SIL is too entitled and lacks respect for animals on her own.", "It's on their mother to teach them that, not OP and their rescue animals.", "Thank you for sharing this story!! It's so wholesome \u2764\ufe0f and yeah, I've got a lot of babies: my doggo, monstera plant and her baby, my camera (her name is baby!!) and some more plants haha", "I agree with you on that. Children raised around animals from a young age would know how to act. It didn't sound like that is the case with Kate's kids.", "Yeah it sounds like the kids parents aren't teaching them to respect animals, but that they're \"better than\" (?) pets and can do whatever they want and the pets should just let them. I bet the toddlers smack the dogs in the face and the parents do nothing. Definitely a recipe for disaster, those kids are going to get bitten one day.", "My wife and I refer to our dogs as our son and daughter,  and our cats as our benevolent dictators", "I refer to my brother's dog as my furry nephew. My son is also often referred to as our cats' brother.", "My sister in law calls our dog her nephew \ud83d\ude1d", "omg :(", "Omg. You are NTA at all. Poor fur babies.", "Thank you for the extra info. You are so not the ass.", "For sure like the answer that doesn\u2019t involve pain and resentments is gonna be completely out of the box. Like say OP and husband taking the kids to a Zoo, then a farm and eventually a shelter. Building a relationship with her family. Kids are wild as fuck at home because they\u2019re comfortable and they\u2019re kids. Gotta have the same understanding and respect for them as the animals. Can\u2019t imagine introducing all these rescues was all sunshine and rainbows but you work through the issues until you have harmony.", "IDK if it was this post or another but I said previously that this sub is full of the weirdest family dynamics man\u2026\n\nNo it may not technically be her responsibility but is this a family or just people? I can\u2019t imagine not wanting to take the time to help my neices or nephews learn \u2026 anything really but how to best interact with my pets so they can be regular visitors would definitely be on the list.\n\nThis just reads as people who may be biologically related but don\u2019t actually like each other so it\u2019s whatever I guess.", "Definitely doesn't and, unfortunately, the sil doesn't get how dangerous horses can be when my youngest is around new horses/at shows I'm a nervous wreck because she has no fear of them, and no matter how much I try she doesn't fully understand how dangerous horses are. She hates it when I make her wear a helmet.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I often hear this about cats but don't have any (I think they're evil LMAO).", "I had to look up what niblings mean \ud83e\udd23", "Did you read the part where the SIL wants to use the animals as props for a photo shoot with her kids in the snow? Where in anything that OP has said lead you to believe this mom wants to teach her kids to be kind to animals? \nAnd again you had the kids and it your responsibility to find a safe space for them to \u201cblow off steam\u201d, and the last places on freaking earth to do this with a toddler is a child free couples house full of rescued animals!", "And I genuinely cannot imagine subjecting pets to children that cannot behave around them. That's a recipe for disaster on all fronts because it can present so many risks for all parties involved. \n\nThe responsibility in this case falls on their parents, not OP.
