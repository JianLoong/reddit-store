Horses are a part of my hobby, so I also make sure they are enjoying their lives and have ability to spend most of the time outside and not in the stables. It is also worth mentioning that one of the cats is 18 and has been with me since she was a kitten and one of the horses has been with me since he was 4 (he is now 25), so I always refer to them as my precious babies.\n\nMy sister in law \"Kate\" seem to have an issue with the way we refer to our animals, especially the way  I call my oldest ones. I have explained to her multiple times that considering how old they are and how long they have been with me, to me they are like my children as I have raised them, took care of them and looked after them when they were poor. However Kate still feels it is disrespectful to call them babies, as they are not kids and because her own children are not invited in our house and can't spend time with the animals.\n\nIt got worse this week as Kate wanted to come and stay for a few days in our house with kids and her partner and have \"winter wonderland\" photoshoot with the animals, as we got a decent amount of snow over here in the past few days. I have told her she is not allowed as her children are still very young and seem to be unable to treat pira with the care and respect the animals deserve, especially since most of them are rescued. Kate didn't like my answer and blew up calling me an asshole for comparing animals to children and making them more important and for not allowing her to visit.

And my fiancee is on my side here, as he also cares about the animals deeply and have told his sister her kids need to learn how to behave around animals first and treat them with respect and care. He is also able to spend family time with them as we do different activities with them every few weeks.\n\nEdit 2: as it has been asked before. We do spend time with our nephew and niece once every few weeks and do activities together. It is just we are not comfortable with them in our house.\n\nBoth of the kids have been exposed to animals, they visit my MIL a few times a week who has dogs, however due to the way they behave around and to the dogs, her dogs tend to hide when the kids are there and refuse to come out.", "created_utc": 1678542536, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11oknf9/aita_for_calling_my_pets_my_babies_in_front_of_my/", "score": 2105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My home is their safe place. It is up to me to ensure they feel safe in it. \n\nMy dog is also part Pit. With me he is a big ole goofball, but the only way he is allowed to interact with kids is when he is on a leash and under my control. That is for the child's safety. In part it is because of his breed's reputation ( deserved or not), I have seen what he can do with prey he's caught. And in part because he is a tall 75 pound doofus. He could hurt a small child without meaning to just by being silly.\n\nMy cats enjoy their peace and quiet in the house. They should not have to put up with that being disturbed by small children.\n\nAs for small children around horses, the potential for serious injury is scary.

I don't have my own children to slowly, consistently, and appropriately get my dogs used to children. I'm sure as heck not going to try and use someone else's child who's definitely more excitable and less in control than normal because they are out of routine and excited about visiting. That's a recipe for disaster, and will likely end up with a bit, scratched, or at least scared child. It can reinforce the wrong behavior for the pet (who got left alone and continues to reinforce that kids are scary) and can make the child no longer feel safe around animals.\n\nI've had my nieces and nephews visit me and had to visit them with dogs in tow before. The time with the dogs out was exhausting, as we spent the whole time teaching, reminding, and redirecting the children and actively working with the dogs to keep them calm and comfortable around the children, so we wouldn't reinforce the idea that kids are scary. The rest of the time the dogs had to be put away in a separate room so the dogs could feel safe, the children could play how they wanted, and we could actually enjoy the company we were with, including the children.\n\nHaving pets that are grown, healthy, and both used to and enjoy being around children is one thing and it can be great  to have the children socialize children with your pets.

You sound like you merely dislike children and are looking for reasons to keep it up, and are probably a total asshole in general. NTA in this situation, but you suck.", "Are you not normally privy to the contents of your own mind? Or does it always take extreme annoyance to think thoughts?\n\nP.S. not implying you're stupid just deconstructing your euphemism on a whim, please don't take offense.", "OP doesn't sound like someone I'd like, however they are completely within their right to not allow people into their home, for whatever reason. Kate is being really intrusive and needs to back off", "I never said it was her responsibility, I was asking if it was a possibility. Of course you have to protect the animals, when did I say you didn't?  And it does sound like she's created a wonderland. \nI agreed the sister was out of line, and the op was nta..", "Not op or her pets job to teach someone else\u2019s kids. Not. Her. Job. Period.", ">Both of the kids have been exposed to animals, they visit my MIL a few times a week who has dogs, however due to the way they behave around and to the dogs, her dogs tend to hide when the kids are there and refuse to come out.\n\nIf you missed this edit--this is why. It's clear that SIL has no interest in making an effort to teach her children how to interact with animals, and it's not on OP to do it.", "Yeah, that's too young to be around horses IMO, especially since you've mentioned they've been around dogs that now *hide* when they visit. That's a sign the kids don't know how to properly behave around animals yet.\n\nNTA", "What in the world??  I\u2019d kick that kid out into traffic - and send his dad soon after.", "I simply don't anthropomorphize animals.", "Aren't the goats the actual Old Gods?", "It says \"a few days.\" That's really weird Kate was inviting herself. I mean, I get if they show up for a photoshoot and leave but \"Hey we want to stay at your place for free multiple days.\" and then get mad when the answer is no? Also they want to use the animals like props with children who have zero experience around animals? Wtf.", "Yes! People - especially family! - suck, right? This family doesn\u2019t sound more \u201centitled and tedious,\u201dnor the kids (3 and 5, I\u2019ll remind you) worse \u201cunpleasant terrors\u201d than the next. Don\u2019t have a family, I guess. Spend your Christmases or Hanukkahs with your chickens and goats. No where have I called OP the a-h.", "NTA it sounds like you\u2019re being responsible regarding not allowing the children to be around your pets for their own safety. Children as young as they are often think they\u2019re being gentle when they\u2019re not. \n\nYour SIL is 100% out of order inviting her family over for a photoshoot with your pets without consulting you first, and for being irrational when you said no.\n\nThe only thing I can think of that might make you a little bit T A H would be if you have said something to her to suggest that your love for your pets is the same as a mothers love for their child. I\u2019ve heard many people who choose to have pets as their \u201cbabies\u201d make this statement and even before I was a mum I thought it was pretty disrespectful.", "Maude is that you?", "My goodness, such sensitive little buttons you have.\n\nDef found OP\u2019s SIL ^", "lol, sure. Whatever you say. You can continue looking absurd if you wish, but that is how regular people view the whole \"muh pets arr peepul tWo!?!\" mentality.", "LOL. Not at all. You seem to struggle with reading comprehension.", "So what? Their opinion about it is just an opinion.   \n\n\nEveryone knows that their pets aren't humans, pretending it's about that is dumb. You guys are getting angry about a figure of speech because you feel entitled to a word.", "What part, exactly, do I \u201cseem to be struggling with\u201d?", "LOL. Well, for starters, when you put something in quotes it should be \u2026 a quote?", "You can\u2019t be serious\u2026"]}
