So to me, that\u2019s NTA.", "Given OP says that the kids have been unable to treat the animals with care and respect, it seems that the children have been given that chance in the past and failed. That\u2019s on the kids parents to teach them how to act around pets.", "Yes all that you do for animals is fine in your lifetime. But you do the whole of animal kind a disservice by not spreading your knowledge and understanding of animals.\n\nTeach as many people as you can, Don't hold back your talents and rob the world of spreading the spirit of animal care/rescue.", "My fiancee is against them visiting too as he has told his sister that she needs to teach them how to behave around animals first before they can visit.\n\nIt is not the case of him not seeing them as we still go on activities together every other week for a family time.", "[removed]", "I don't like dogs, my mom didn't like rodents, my roommate doesn't like dogs or kids - are we all AHs?\n\nDefinitely not grounds for judging someone's character.", "as OP's edit shows, these kids don't know how to behave around animals and on top of that, her fiancee is in total agreement with her. plus they DO in fact spend time with those kids.\n\nbut really, why on earth would OP (or anyone else for that matter) be an AH if they DIDN'T like kids? not everyone is particularly fond of them.", "How does not liking kids make someone an AH? Plenty of kind, caring people out there just don\u2019t like children and don\u2019t want to be around them. It\u2019s not the majority view, but it\u2019s completely normal thing and it doesn\u2019t automatically make that person an AH.", "Strange that you gave this judgement and explanation without requesting the info of how the husband feels", "Forgot the judgement (again) and Reddit won't let me edit, so just to be clear: NTA, but consider teaching your nephews/nieces how to be good pet owners, because it will make the world better for everyone, including all fur babies.", "I don't think our babies are the best pets to learn how to be around pets.\n\nThe older cat has mobility issues and going blind, so she prefers some peace and quiet and gets stressed at loud noises.\n\nThe other cat is very shy and hides when she sees new people, it takes her a while to get used to someone. She also doesn't like to be picked up.\n\nThe other 2 who are brothers tend to play rough and don't retract their claws on time, due to their sizes they also try to dominate new people and especially kids, and sometimes see kids as pray so they organise playful hunts which are not pleasant. \n\nDogs were abused by their previous owners, and one of them is half pitbull, so they react very strongly if they get hit by accident. Also both of them sometimes get overexcited and jump on people, which is fine for an adult, but a small kid might end up on the ground and find their playful attitude too rough and scary.\n\nHorses is a different subject entirely. My oldest one is perfect around kids and is a great example to teach them how to be around horses, as he is very gentle and friendly, but he is getting old and I don't want to risk him getting spooked by something the child does and injure himself. Plus I need to be extra careful what they try to feed him as he had some colics in the past. I just feel like I owe him that much and he deserves a calm retirement and can enjoy his life as a free horse. The other 2 one is a youngster who just turned 3 and all he wants to do is play. And the last thing you want is having the horse to play with the small humans as they can be dangerous if you don't know your way around, the last one is my sport horse, he is very strict and has some behaviour issues (he can bite) and is also very ticklish and sensitive. So not exactly child friendly.", "I believe I have replied to one of the comments with their behaviours.\n\nI would have been fine introducing them one at a time, but the kids don't seem to be willing to learn and I have seen them interacting with my MIL pets and were too rough to the point her dogs avoid them and hide.", "yeah, one of my most frightening moments with my first dog was when we passed a dad and a small kid during a walk - and the kid out of nowhere ran to my dog (who was on the leash) and smashed my dog over the head with a stone in his hand... \n\nDad did absolutely nothing to stop the kid or to teach him something after... and if my dog reacted badly it could have been a total disaster. \n\nthankfully nothing bad happened, but people really do underestimate how much care and attention should be put into small kids and animal interactions...", "Completely agree here. \n\nI'm waiting until Kate calls up and goes \"Hey, can my kids come play with their cousins??\"", "Of all the ways you could have said that, you chose skin babies", "She's not obliged to like children.", "Op stated in another comment that every week they go out for family time so I think it\u2019s just the issue of coming to her house. NTA", "Pira is a typo, posting through my phone and I think I tried to type something else and my phone came up with pira.", "Thanks! That's pretty young to be around horses and some animals with special needs. I had fish that I called my babies lol. If you raise and love something it becomes so special to you.", "Indeed. How else do you train or learn besides proximity and access?\n\nJust seems like an odd hill to die on.\n\nJust going to wait until they are 10 and no longer want to hang because you\u2019re mad about how they acted at 3 and 5?", "But it's not their responsibility to teach these children about animals. Why should they subject their pet babies to human children who don't know how to treat them? This is the parents job. I don't let kids interact with my cat unless they already have plenty of experience with animals and know AT LEAST the basics- be gentle, don't grab, don't pull trails, etc. It is especially important to protect older animals from potentially grabby kids (and adults).", "Then NTA if there is an agreement with your fiancee in this point.", "Question, how often have the kids been exposed to animals to learn how to treat them?  Have there been instances of them hurting animals? I\u2019m curious because that information seems lacking", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Haha", "Np I was just wondering if that was one of your kids names, just saw your edit and those kids seem way too young imo. They may not fully understand how to act around cats, dogs or horses and I doubt your sister would discipline them. Just a feeling", "If the kids have been given the opportunity in the past and failed then the parents should acclimate them first with animals that are not rescues who have lasting triggers (maybe another friend has a happy and friendly golden or something). You can\u2019t make the kids learn in OPs home environment as one mistake could lead to a child getting bit.\n\nOP is incredibly smart for not using her rescue animals and horses as training devices.", " I don\u2019t really see that\u2019s the problem. Why did they have to come to her house?  I\u2019m pretty sure they can bond at her sister house.", "No one said it had to be these people. Just don't hide your light and your knowledge under a barrel. The more it shines and spreads the better for everyone.", "My seven year old refers to our dog as his sister and told my 5 year old nephew that's his cousin lol.", "Time with family? Get the kids out of the home?

It\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to subject her animals to a 3 & 5 year old that don\u2019t know how to interact with animals and it\u2019s not her responsibility to teach them how to treat animals.
