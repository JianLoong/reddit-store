I have been with my husband45 for 4 years. My husband has a daughter Shianna19.\n\nI had asked Shianna to be one of my bridesmaids. Her mom passed away when she was young, and I have always tried to have a connection with her, but she was always very against me. She\u2019s tried pinning us against each other for as long as I can remember or she just not friendly to me. I\u2019ve tried engaging with her in things I know she liked. I tried helping her with college tours. She actually spent 3 days at her grandmothers when she found out her father proposed to me. Nothing seemed to work till I asked her to be my bridesmaid. She was very excited which I was shocked by, but took this as my opportunity to bond.\n\nI chose a light blue for my bridesmaid dresses but let them pick the dress, and my husband bought Shiannas since she\u2019s in college and only works part time and was worried she wouldn\u2019t be able to afford an elegant enough dress for our wedding. My husband was very excited about his daughter being in the wedding as well.\n\nDay of the wedding, I have 2 other bridesmaids, my sister, and my best friend. I\u2019m getting my makeup done, and they come up to me and whisper that I have to see what shiannas wearing and to stay calm and not ruin my day. So I marched down to the room Shianna was in to see. She did not have the dress we bought her one, in fact she had a white long fluffy dress on, very similar to a wedding dress.\n\nI asked her what she was wearing and she just said \u201cI liked this one better, light blue is ugly.\u201d I was so mad, I told her she didn\u2019t match with the wedding party, and she needed to change if she wanted to be in the wedding. She just shook her head and said \u201cyou can\u2019t kick me out, my dads here.\u201d I said \u201cyou can stay all you want, but you won\u2019t be in the wedding party.\u201d We argued for a few minutes before I finally told her to go find a seat then because I didn\u2019t want her being one of my bridesmaids no more.\n\nShe got angry and instead left. After my husband noticed Shianna wasn\u2019t in the wedding he began acting weird. He was very cold and off the rest of the day, even after I explained what happened. \n\nWe\u2019re at this beautiful honeymoon resort in Florida and he slept most the plane ride, then when we got here we got into a big argument about Shianna being kicked out. He didn\u2019t see the white dress and the direct defiance as big of an issue as I did. She had texted him this BS excuse about how she didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be an issue and thought it\u2019d be okay. She even pointed out that I was probably worried she\u2019d look better then me and oh how she didn\u2019t wanna ruin my special day. \n\n We\u2019re not arguing anymore but he\u2019s still a little distant and we\u2019ve only even went out a few times because of it.  I feel like maybe I should\u2019ve just ignored the dress because now it\u2019s ruining my honeymoon.\n\nThe dress was similar to this: https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwj6tc3Snor9AhWh4IYKHZ7iCqkYABBDGgJ2dQ&ae=2&sig=AOD64_2DfKDv2B9JBGFPFxoJ7ZgLJVhZlw&adurl&ctype=5&ved=0CAQQ0LYHKCFqGAoTCPDToteeiv0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABC7Aw", "created_utc": 1676007268, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10yhcr6/aita_for_kicking_stepdaughter_out_of_my_wedding/", "score": 198, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You chose and she lost. Sadly, you were unable to talk it out with your fianc\u00e9 before the actual ceremony so she may ultimately 'win' by breaking up your marriage. You and your husband need to talk this out with a professional so he can get an outside opinion. She is 19 and knew exactly what she was doing. NTA", "NTA.\n\nThat's just not okay. She knew exactly what she was doing. And she might succeed in breaking you up, if your husbond doesn't open his eyes.", "Wow Shianna is a little shit. Good luck NTA", "She bought a white dress? White? Your husband needs to talk to a few more people, or just google it.  Only the bride wears white to the wedding, that\u2019s common knowledge.  \n\nNTA", "NTA - your stepdaughter got herself thrown out, and I for one suspect that was her plan all along in a last ditch effort to sabotage your relationship.", "NTA she planned this. As soon as you asked her to be a bridesmaid, she said yes and started plotting her big entrance on your wedding day. His daughter is top shelf AH. And if he can't see that, I'd honestly reconsider that marriage. His grown adult daughter tried to upstage you at your wedding. That's just disgusting behavior and your husband needs to get his head out of his ass and have your back on this AND EVERY OTHER ATTEMPT at driving a wedge between you. \n\nShe's basically one of those people who doesn't want the surviving parent to ever find someone to spend their life with. She'll be perfectly happy being the only woman in his life even if that means he grows old alone and lonely.\n\nShe is selfish. And toxic. \n\nThis would be my hill to die on. She would have to apologize profusely or she would NOT be welcome in my house. \n\nYour husband did a shit job raising this brat. Tell him to handle it.", "Nta\n\nBut I'm petty enough to have the girl walk down the aisle in the white dress. A couple reasons for this. 1. She'd face off with nasty looks and comments from friends and family for her shenanigans. Most families would call her out directly for her behavior  and 2. Your husband would have seen the dress and her ploy to ruin your wedding, and it would have caused less stress on your honeymoon.   But again, I'm petty af.\n\nI you're things start to get smoother and you're new hubby starts to understand what's going on. Best of luck", "That little trouble maker knew exactly what she was doing from the very moment you asked her to be in the wedding. This was her plan from the start. It\u2019s worrying that your husband did not see the issue with this. She WORE WHITE TO A WEDDING! Lol wedding rule #1 is don\u2019t wear white unless the bride explicitly asks you to. And you asked her to change and gave her an opportunity to be a part of the wedding and she refused. She kicked herself out. Anyone in your position would\u2019ve done the same thing. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Maybe you should've let her be a bridesmaid like that and let her suffer the natural consequences of regret. She would've made a fool of herself.", "Yeah get an annulment.

This further proves you right on that front.", "NTA  You should have talked to him about it first, though. He should totally have a say in what matters on his own wedding day. But also it should've been a no-brainer for him, because: of freaking course she can't be a bridesmaid in that getup!\n\nBut still...NTA because SHE IS A MANIPULATIVE CONTROLLING BACKSTABBING NARCISSIST for wearing a LiTeRaL wedding dress to a wedding and **as a bridesmaid** She obviously planned this and had time to say she didn't like the color. What the heck kind of bridesmaid changes dresses without consulting the bride? And ain't no bridesmaid thinking that's a good swap.\n\nAt the same time, it would've been sort of hilarious to let her walk the aisle. All the guests who don't know her be like, \"wait, am I at the wrong wedding?\"\ud83d\ude02 And then people would ask and you could tell them and they'd all judge what a nasty thing it was for her to do and ALSO say wow you were a good sport. Like people would talk about it for YEARS. You'd be a legend! But still, you aren't TA. She \ud83d\udcaf is.", "NTA but you played this all wrong. You should have requested you husband deal with it. You don't deal with his family, you make him do it as you deal with your own. You could have sent a text or the Maid of Honor to explain the situation and summon him to ask her to wear the right dress. You didn't even have to mention kicking her out, that's exactly what she wanted.\n\nIn the future, just defer to him when she does stuff, he's her father, it's his job. Don't even get sucked into text messages. My MIL once sent me this email insulting everything about me, I read the first paragraph, then forwarded it to my husband with the subject line, \"handle this\". Done and I didn't have anything to do with that power play.", "NTA.  Shots fired.  OP she crossed a line and there should be consequences like not extending anymore courtesies or monetary contributions.  People don't get rewarded for acting malicious then playing the victim.", "NTA She knew exactly what she was doing when she got that dress. I bet she did this so you'd kick her out of the bridal party in order to cause trouble between you and her dad.  Her dad is being naive about her motives.", "NTA but as others pointed out, you should have just let her embarrass herself", "If her plot (and I\u2019m sure she had one) was to wreck your wedding/honeymoon,she nailed it. I\u2019m sorry,it seems like you really tried but this person is your enemy. The only question is\u2026does that make your new husband one? He NEEDS to understand what a rotten thing she did on your wedding day and needs to recognize the way this is. If not,this marriage is already in trouble.", "NTA - and good for you for kicking her out of the wedding party. It is very common knowledge that wearing a white dress to someone else\u2019s wedding is absolutely unacceptable. You do not do that - ever - without permission from the bride.\n\nYour husband is SO wrong to be upset at you for this. His daughter tried to pull a nasty little stunt to ruin the wedding - she knew exactly what she was doing. He really needs to take the blinders off where his daughter is concerned.", "NTA\n\nShe clearly knew what she was doing. I would suggest addressing this with a neutral mediator for this. It is going to be hard for your husband to accept that his daughter tried to destroy his wedding and by extension marriage.", "NTA but it sounds like she succeeded in sabotaging your marriage either way. She really did put you in a no win situation.", "NTA\n\nBut your husband needed to see what his daughter was doing.  You had multiple witnesses with what happened so at least you have that.\n\nThe stupid thing is that if you had've let her just walk down the aisle in her wedding dress, she would've just looked like a right royal dick and people would not be looking very favourably on her.\n\nYou've got some difficult decisions to make depending on what happens now.  Your husband is caught between a rock and a hard place and he missed the actual bad behaviour and may side with his daughter.  You may need to give her enough rope to hang herself in the future... if there is a future.", "She wasn't \"kicked out\" of the wedding.\n\nNTA. \n\nYour husband may nor be The One though.", "NTA - but I would encourage you to restate what happened to you kicked her out of the wedding party due to her act of defiance, and she was the one that chose to leave the wedding itself. \n\nI agree that she was likely looking for you to make a bigger deal (ie kick her out entirely) instead of just leaving her off the wedding party.  Not to say that I am petty but.... this would have been a case where if your bridesmaids were more on it they would have had a whoopsy with red wine too close to that dress....", "NTA- Show him this post.\n\nIf he can\u2019t accept what she did was wrong i\u2019d re-evaluate this marriage.", "ESH.  White dress was an AH move, but ~~kicking her out~~ (edit:) removing her as a bridesmaid without talking to your husband was not cool.  You and your husband need to be a team -- you should have worked this out with him.", "YTA. You shouldn't have kicked her out without speaking with her dad first.\n\nHonestly, you should have just let her use the dress. Having people telling her how ridiculous it is that she looks like she is ready to marry her own father would be punishment enough.", "YTA. You threw his daughter out of HIS wedding. \n\nI don't care about the dress, or her brattyness. You threw your fianc\u00e9/husband's daughter out of HIS wedding. \n\nWhat, you were worried the party didn't match? That the photos would be off? Your perfect day wouldn't be all you hoped it would be? And instead of rolling with you you -- a 42-year-old adult -- decided to throw a tantrum because your precious wedding wasn't exactly how you wanted it. And you threw his daughter out of his wedding. \n\nI hope he gets the marriage annulled. You give zero craps about his feelings, and while it's too bad everything has been paid for, it's better to know that sooner than later.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The only people who do are \\[1\\] MILs who want to compete with the women \"taking away their darling child\" or \\[2\\] selfish narcissistic AHs who want to spoil the bride's special day by competing/drawing attention.\n\nIt's stupid of them, bc it highlights their personal insecurity and the lengths they are willing to go to to try to sabotage the bride. It usually backfires bc attendees recognise what a shitty thing it is to try to do to the bride.\n\nIn some ways, it's a shame you didn't just let her wear it and reap the caustic comments she would have got from your friends. 19 is old enough to deserve every one of them and no doubt a lot of red wine would have been 'accidently' spilled by your clumsy friends. As it is, she's managing to play the victim here.\n\nAn interesting point is how did she afford this competing wedding dress \"since she\u2019s in college and only works part time\"? Did whoever raised her pay for it? The grandparents? Was this a concerted plan by several people?\n\nWhat I find so annoying is how clueless men apparently are. I say apparently, bc it's hard to believe they've not picked up this nugget of wedding etiquette over the months of wedding preparation. I think it's a convenient excuse for them to ignore the bs pulled by their mothers/daughters/sisters etc.\n\nI'm sorry you husband is sulking; until he recognises *this was something his daughter deliberately chose to do to try to hurt you*, there's not much you can do.

He does her no favours by not holding her accountable for being a not so great person", "Okay. NTA. But there seems to be a lot of unsolved issues in the background. Did your husband date anyone else before he met you? I am only asking since she seems to be so resentful of your role in the family. \n\nIn general I put a lot of the onus of building a good relationship with the SD on the new partner, as it is the grown up who has to be the bigger person. Especially in cases where there is no mother in their life, so you are essentially in practice stepping into that role. When you partner with someone who has a child, that child SHOULD be the first priority for them. I also do agree it would have been better if you had asked your husband to deal with the issue.", "DH bought her a dress in colour code and she goes out and buys a WHITE  dress,  why does DH not see the problem?", "Maybe say that you'll wear the exact same dress or a similar dress to her wedding because it's not a big deal right?\n\nNTA, but you do have to have a full conversation with your husband because she won at driving a wedge between you guys", "Oh hell no. She's 19 and did her best to break you guys up from the moment you came into the picture. I bet the only reason she was excited to be a bridesmaid was because she had already bought the dress and was going to try and ruin the wedding anyway. She saw her opportunity and took it but it backfired on the day and so she's sulking trying to get your husband to side with her.\n\nI feel so sorry that she did that on your wedding day OP and it sucks that is getting in the way of your honeymoon. I wish you the best of luck with this whole situation and hope that it gets resolved and it doesn't ruin your marriage. Lots of love \u2764\ufe0f \n\nNTA", "Well, her plan succeeded. Hind sight is 20/20 and all that, but you should have played it cool when you saw her dress, go like \u201dthat dress is beautiful! You will look amazing.\u201d And then let her ridicule herself.\n\nNTA for the question of course, she was way out of line. Im so sorry you got played and that the honey moon is affected by it.", "I do not think  this is an honest recounting. I would be interested in the girls version.", "NTA- this was her plan all along and she succeeded. I\u2019m sorry your husband doesn\u2019t see it. I agree with others who say you can try getting a counselor involved. It\u2019s a shame to have to start marriage counseling right after your honeymoon, but probably a good idea in this case.", "NTA - and show your husband this post. He shouldn't be acting like you did something wrong and his sweet princess is the victim.", "NTA. She should\u2019ve been kicked out of the wedding, not just the wedding party for the stunt she pulled. This is what would happen if she pulled this at any other wedding. \n\nI would rip my husband a new one for not supporting me on this. Absolutely ridiculous. His \u201clittle princess\u201d sounds like a tacky and obnoxious monster. Thank goodness she\u2019s over 18 so hopefully she cannot cause too many issues in your relationship.", "NTA she's 19 not a small child. The switch to being nice after asked to join the wedding party sounds like she planned it. You and your husband need to get on the same page. Family counseling should've started before the wedding. Good luck", "There\u2019s something very creepy about a teenage girl trying to wear white to her father\u2019s wedding. Talk about DADDY ISSUES. Someone get this girl a therapist.", "NTA- is your new husband an idiot?  Seriously is he a clueless moron when it comes to weddings?  Maybe, bug maybe, a child under 10 wearing a fluffy white dress in this case would be passable, as they area child and I think flower girls sometimes wear white, but her grown ass is 19.  She knew what she was doing and if he doesn\u2019t pull his head out of his butt to see it, he will end up alone.  \nIf you are at a place where there are others, be petty and ask them how they would react to this scenario.  \u201cWhy yes I will have a white wine, oh and can I ask you your opinion on a little argument myself and my new husband are having?\u201d Then lay it out and watch their face.  I wonder if he needs to hear it from strangers as this girl has poisoned him against you.", "NTA from reading stories on here I really am starting to think every bride needs a designated red wine bridesmaid to \u2018accidentally\u2019 spill red wine on the crazy MIL, stepdaughter, ex etc who turns up to the wedding in a wedding dress.", "NTA.  Wow she knew exactly what she was doing.  She knew what buttons to push.  I\u2019m also sure she knows that Dad is clueless when it comes to weddings and what a major slap in the face it was for his daughter to try to wear what she did.  She knew her dad would be mad at you.  She got the reaction she wanted from both of you.  Dad needs to understand how hurtful it was for you.  And unfortunately now he is stuck in the middle.  His daughter obviously doesn\u2019t like or want you around.  She wants you gone.  Just wait.  Next she will be telling her dad you are cheating.  Dad needs to have a very serious talk with his daughter.  Or you and him will never make it.  The daughter will make sure of it", "Show your husband this thread, so he may realize how fucked up his daughter is, as no one is thinking that what she did is excusable. NTA", "NTA but you have a husband problem, more than a stepdaughter problem. He needs to address her behavior and work with you as a team.\n\nI'm sorry you are already married honestly and that your newlywed time is tainted by this.\n\nPlease insist on marriage counseling and I wish you luck.", "Show your husband this comment. Your daughter purposefully tried to ruin your wedding day by causing unnecessary drama for your new wife. Stop being so blind to her immature and pathetic behavior. \n\nNTA\n\nYou, and everyone else, knows damn well the little jerk pulled that shit on purpose. \n\nShe did it out of spite. She did it because she's a jerk. She did it for attention. She did it to cause drama. \n\nTell your husband in the most direct mannor, you will no longer tolerate Shianna's disrespectful behavior. Period. Not one more time will you allow her the opportunity to treat you so poorly. Not one more freaking time.", "NTA. Unfortunately you made the mistake of not involving your husband when you saw the problem. Your marriage is going to be a miserable one as long as your husband doesn't see the problem. Prepare for an incoming divorce, dont put yourself through this.", "NTA I have to admit I tend to be a little bias with step parents because of personal experience at times.. but Shianna knew exactly what she was doing. Show your husband this thread. I think she could benefit greatly from therapy. Losing a parent young even if you have so few memories it messes you up and everyone handles it differently. If she is in therapy already you should:\n\nFirst, you and when you get back you need couples counseling, at least a few sessions to help create a plan moving forward. Both for what how to approach Shianna and to establish how to mend from the wedding/ honeymoon \n\nSecond, have Shianna and your husband do some family therapy or if she\u2019s comfortable with it have him sit in on a couple of her sessions (but only if she\u2019s comfortable if not, separate family therapy) \n\nAnd third, see about attending some of the family therapy sessions after they have been going for a while and feel like are in a good place. That\u2019s when you will have the opportunity to build a relationship on healthy ground. At the very least a base line of mutual respect needs to be established. \n\nYou don\u2019t sound like a bad person and I\u2019m going to take this in good faith that you aren\u2019t omitting details to make yourself look better (like trying to force her to call you mom and trying to take on disciplinary parenting, she was too old for any of that to be forced or okay) I do think there is a way forward where everyone can have a good relationship. You will have to forgive, your husband will have to support you, and Shianna will have to do some personal growth that\u2019s she will need to do anyway. And that growth will be easier with a support system. Even if it gets harder first. I wish you luck and I hope you\u2019re able to enjoy the rest of your honeymoon a bit more.\n\nEdit: a word", "NTA.\n\nThere's still time to file for annulment. Your life will be hell from now on if you stay.", "NTA. Def should've asked your husband to deal with it rather than going off though. You played right in to her set up!  Agree with other comments - get couples counselling so husband can get an outside perspective on what's going on with daughter.", "**NTA** \n\nShe deliberately tried to upset you with a blatantly disrespectful move - wearing a white dress that looked like a wedding dress - to your wedding. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your new husband is not being supportive to you. He absolutely needs to tell his daughter that she was wrong and owes you an apology.", "Don\u2019t marry people who let their kids walk all over them, it\u2019s one thing to have a respectful stepchild but one like this where they know daddy wont do anything is a major red flag. I would never date someone of their child didn\u2019t like me, it\u2019s just not worth the headache. Good luck op, I would seriously consider If that\u2019s what you want to deal with for the rest of your life because she\u2019s not leaving.", "NTA. The moment she agreed to it right away and was excited was the moment to question everything. She planned it from the start.

But someone should have gotten her father to deal with it\u2026 I bet the end results would have been much better for everyone", "NTA. \n\nshe\u2019s an adult. she knew what she was doing by wearing a wedding dress. not sure how your husband doesn\u2019t see that it was intentional. good luck OP.", "If you think it won't cause the issue to blow up again, call one of your other bridesmaids (recommend your best friend) and have her explain it to him, including his daughter's attitude.\n\nNTA.", "Shianna seems like a conniving bastard. NTA", "NTA\n\nHe doesn't have your back, and this will be a continued issue. Highly suggest you sit him down and say, 'rather than a honeymoon, let's treat this as a goodbye and get an annulment when we get back. If you can't see the issue with Shianna's behavior, then I can't see a future with you.'", "Holy shit, NTA whatsoever. Absolutely not ok! She clearly had this planned form the moment that she was asked to be a bridesmaid!! This was her one moment to say her big Fuck You! \n\nYou should of sent someone to tell you husband what was going on before walking down the aisle, but I totally get that in the moment it wasn\u2019t a thought. She clearly views you as \u201cstealing\u201d her father away and nothing you do going forward or have tried in the past will change that unfortunately. \n\nDH Shiism if address this issue with his daughter back at the beginning you his and yours relationship and got his daughter some counseling to deal with and manner emotions but he didn\u2019t. That\u2019s on him. Good luck going forward because you\u2019re gonna need to, especially if he\u2019s taking his daughter\u2019s side! I hope it all works out.

He might think it\u2019s an \u201chonest mistake\u201d, but it\u2019s clear this was a calculated move.

Of course he is going to be hurt", "NTA shianna is a 19 yr old but she sounds unstable for her age.", "NTA, but you should have seen that coming. Why would someone who hated the fact that you were getting married get excited about being in the bridal party unless she had a plan to upstage/sabotage you?\n\nAnd technically, you didn't kick her out of the wedding, only the wedding party. I also doubt she would have stayed for the wedding anyway. She would have embarrassed herself being in white to her own dad's wedding. It's a bit creepy.", "Yikes. Shianna is a grubby little nightmare human and her dad is angry at you for not, what, tolerating it??? I would reconsider a marriage to somebody who expected me to be treated like shit so his daughter could feel like she was \u201cwinning\u201d and the fact that she\u2019s adult just makes it worse. Your husband is spineless and your step daughter sucks as person. Oh NTA but I hope you don\u2019t sit there feeling guilty in your honeymoon when you did nothing wrong. Ugh", "NTA\n\nFrom what you said about her previous behavior, this was her plan from the beginning.", "NTA. I would probably have let her walk down dresses like the second bride and get all the judgements which, inevitably, would have got.

It\u2019s like she want to look like her dad\u2019s bride!\u201d And laugh about it. I would have even asked for extra photos with her dad and yourself, and draw the attention to it. She would have been livid. \n\nAlso, the dress is objectively ugly. Not even wedding dress type. I wouldn\u2019t have worried about her over shadowing you. People would have judged her to death without your having anything to do.", "Definitely NTA she did this on purpose to cause a problem in your marriage and succeeded.
