I have been with my husband45 for 4 years. My husband has a daughter Shianna19.\n\nI had asked Shianna to be one of my bridesmaids. Her mom passed away when she was young, and I have always tried to have a connection with her, but she was always very against me. She\u2019s tried pinning us against each other for as long as I can remember or she just not friendly to me. I\u2019ve tried engaging with her in things I know she liked. I tried helping her with college tours. She actually spent 3 days at her grandmothers when she found out her father proposed to me. Nothing seemed to work till I asked her to be my bridesmaid. She was very excited which I was shocked by, but took this as my opportunity to bond.\n\nI chose a light blue for my bridesmaid dresses but let them pick the dress, and my husband bought Shiannas since she\u2019s in college and only works part time and was worried she wouldn\u2019t be able to afford an elegant enough dress for our wedding. My husband was very excited about his daughter being in the wedding as well.\n\nDay of the wedding, I have 2 other bridesmaids, my sister, and my best friend. I\u2019m getting my makeup done, and they come up to me and whisper that I have to see what shiannas wearing and to stay calm and not ruin my day. So I marched down to the room Shianna was in to see. She did not have the dress we bought her one, in fact she had a white long fluffy dress on, very similar to a wedding dress.\n\nI asked her what she was wearing and she just said \u201cI liked this one better, light blue is ugly.\u201d I was so mad, I told her she didn\u2019t match with the wedding party, and she needed to change if she wanted to be in the wedding. She just shook her head and said \u201cyou can\u2019t kick me out, my dads here.\u201d I said \u201cyou can stay all you want, but you won\u2019t be in the wedding party.\u201d We argued for a few minutes before I finally told her to go find a seat then because I didn\u2019t want her being one of my bridesmaids no more.\n\nShe got angry and instead left. After my husband noticed Shianna wasn\u2019t in the wedding he began acting weird. He was very cold and off the rest of the day, even after I explained what happened. \n\nWe\u2019re at this beautiful honeymoon resort in Florida and he slept most the plane ride, then when we got here we got into a big argument about Shianna being kicked out. He didn\u2019t see the white dress and the direct defiance as big of an issue as I did. She had texted him this BS excuse about how she didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be an issue and thought it\u2019d be okay. She even pointed out that I was probably worried she\u2019d look better then me and oh how she didn\u2019t wanna ruin my special day. \n\n We\u2019re not arguing anymore but he\u2019s still a little distant and we\u2019ve only even went out a few times because of it.  I feel like maybe I should\u2019ve just ignored the dress because now it\u2019s ruining my honeymoon.\n\nThe dress was similar to this: https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwj6tc3Snor9AhWh4IYKHZ7iCqkYABBDGgJ2dQ&ae=2&sig=AOD64_2DfKDv2B9JBGFPFxoJ7ZgLJVhZlw&adurl&ctype=5&ved=0CAQQ0LYHKCFqGAoTCPDToteeiv0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABC7Aw", "created_utc": 1676007268, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10yhcr6/aita_for_kicking_stepdaughter_out_of_my_wedding/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband should have supported you in this. The fact that he took his daughters manipulation at face value and didn\u2019t support you in this matter is concerning and doesn\u2019t bode well for the long term.", "She tried a power play thinking you had no choice. You chose and she lost. Sadly, you were unable to talk it out with your fianc\u00e9 before the actual ceremony so she may ultimately 'win' by breaking up your marriage. You and your husband need to talk this out with a professional so he can get an outside opinion. She is 19 and knew exactly what she was doing. NTA", "NTA.\n\nThat's just not okay. She knew exactly what she was doing. And she might succeed in breaking you up, if your husbond doesn't open his eyes.", "Wow Shianna is a little shit. Good luck NTA", "She bought a white dress? White? Your husband needs to talk to a few more people, or just google it.  Only the bride wears white to the wedding, that\u2019s common knowledge.  \n\nNTA", "NTA - your stepdaughter got herself thrown out, and I for one suspect that was her plan all along in a last ditch effort to sabotage your relationship.", "NTA she planned this. As soon as you asked her to be a bridesmaid, she said yes and started plotting her big entrance on your wedding day. His daughter is top shelf AH. And if he can't see that, I'd honestly reconsider that marriage. His grown adult daughter tried to upstage you at your wedding. That's just disgusting behavior and your husband needs to get his head out of his ass and have your back on this AND EVERY OTHER ATTEMPT at driving a wedge between you. \n\nShe's basically one of those people who doesn't want the surviving parent to ever find someone to spend their life with. She'll be perfectly happy being the only woman in his life even if that means he grows old alone and lonely.\n\nShe is selfish. And toxic. \n\nThis would be my hill to die on. She would have to apologize profusely or she would NOT be welcome in my house. \n\nYour husband did a shit job raising this brat. Tell him to handle it.", "Nta\n\nBut I'm petty enough to have the girl walk down the aisle in the white dress. A couple reasons for this. 1. She'd face off with nasty looks and comments from friends and family for her shenanigans. Most families would call her out directly for her behavior  and 2. Your husband would have seen the dress and her ploy to ruin your wedding, and it would have caused less stress on your honeymoon.   But again, I'm petty af.\n\nI you're things start to get smoother and you're new hubby starts to understand what's going on. Best of luck", "That little trouble maker knew exactly what she was doing from the very moment you asked her to be in the wedding. This was her plan from the start. It\u2019s worrying that your husband did not see the issue with this. She WORE WHITE TO A WEDDING! Lol wedding rule #1 is don\u2019t wear white unless the bride explicitly asks you to. And you asked her to change and gave her an opportunity to be a part of the wedding and she refused. She kicked herself out. Anyone in your position would\u2019ve done the same thing. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Maybe you should've let her be a bridesmaid like that and let her suffer the natural consequences of regret. She would've made a fool of herself.", "Yeah get an annulment.

Any wedding that includes a fight the next day is a wedding that shouldn't have happened.\n\nNTA", "NTA, I\u2019d have called her father right then and there, and if he didn\u2019t see the issue I wouldn\u2019t have married him.

Good luck", "NTA, it was well within your right to kick her out as a bridesmaid. The fact she left the wedding altogether is on her alone. If hubby ain't happy, now you know he might not be the guy...", "NTA. This was planned. She knew exactly what would happen. You said she has always been against you. This further proves you right on that front.", "NTA  You should have talked to him about it first, though. He should totally have a say in what matters on his own wedding day. But also it should've been a no-brainer for him, because: of freaking course she can't be a bridesmaid in that getup!\n\nBut still...NTA because SHE IS A MANIPULATIVE CONTROLLING BACKSTABBING NARCISSIST for wearing a LiTeRaL wedding dress to a wedding and **as a bridesmaid** She obviously planned this and had time to say she didn't like the color. What the heck kind of bridesmaid changes dresses without consulting the bride? And ain't no bridesmaid thinking that's a good swap.\n\nAt the same time, it would've been sort of hilarious to let her walk the aisle. All the guests who don't know her be like, \"wait, am I at the wrong wedding?\"\ud83d\ude02 And then people would ask and you could tell them and they'd all judge what a nasty thing it was for her to do and ALSO say wow you were a good sport. Like people would talk about it for YEARS. You'd be a legend! But still, you aren't TA. She \ud83d\udcaf is.", "NTA but you played this all wrong. You should have requested you husband deal with it. You don't deal with his family, you make him do it as you deal with your own. You could have sent a text or the Maid of Honor to explain the situation and summon him to ask her to wear the right dress. You didn't even have to mention kicking her out, that's exactly what she wanted.\n\nIn the future, just defer to him when she does stuff, he's her father, it's his job. Don't even get sucked into text messages. My MIL once sent me this email insulting everything about me, I read the first paragraph, then forwarded it to my husband with the subject line, \"handle this\". Done and I didn't have anything to do with that power play.", "NTA.  Shots fired.  OP she crossed a line and there should be consequences like not extending anymore courtesies or monetary contributions.  People don't get rewarded for acting malicious then playing the victim.", "NTA She knew exactly what she was doing when she got that dress. I bet she did this so you'd kick her out of the bridal party in order to cause trouble between you and her dad.  Her dad is being naive about her motives.", "NTA but as others pointed out, you should have just let her embarrass herself", "If her plot (and I\u2019m sure she had one) was to wreck your wedding/honeymoon,she nailed it. I\u2019m sorry,it seems like you really tried but this person is your enemy. The only question is\u2026does that make your new husband one? He NEEDS to understand what a rotten thing she did on your wedding day and needs to recognize the way this is. If not,this marriage is already in trouble.", "NTA - and good for you for kicking her out of the wedding party. It is very common knowledge that wearing a white dress to someone else\u2019s wedding is absolutely unacceptable. You do not do that - ever - without permission from the bride.\n\nYour husband is SO wrong to be upset at you for this. His daughter tried to pull a nasty little stunt to ruin the wedding - she knew exactly what she was doing. He really needs to take the blinders off where his daughter is concerned.", "NTA\n\nShe clearly knew what she was doing. I would suggest addressing this with a neutral mediator for this. It is going to be hard for your husband to accept that his daughter tried to destroy his wedding and by extension marriage.", "NTA but it sounds like she succeeded in sabotaging your marriage either way. She really did put you in a no win situation.", "NTA\n\nBut your husband needed to see what his daughter was doing.  You had multiple witnesses with what happened so at least you have that.\n\nThe stupid thing is that if you had've let her just walk down the aisle in her wedding dress, she would've just looked like a right royal dick and people would not be looking very favourably on her.\n\nYou've got some difficult decisions to make depending on what happens now.  Your husband is caught between a rock and a hard place and he missed the actual bad behaviour and may side with his daughter.  You may need to give her enough rope to hang herself in the future... if there is a future.", "She wasn't \"kicked out\" of the wedding.\n\nNTA. \n\nYour husband may nor be The One though.", "NTA - but I would encourage you to restate what happened to you kicked her out of the wedding party due to her act of defiance, and she was the one that chose to leave the wedding itself. \n\nI agree that she was likely looking for you to make a bigger deal (ie kick her out entirely) instead of just leaving her off the wedding party.  Not to say that I am petty but.... this would have been a case where if your bridesmaids were more on it they would have had a whoopsy with red wine too close to that dress....", "NTA- Show him this post.\n\nIf he can\u2019t accept what she did was wrong i\u2019d re-evaluate this marriage.", "ESH.  White dress was an AH move, but ~~kicking her out~~ (edit:) removing her as a bridesmaid without talking to your husband was not cool.  You and your husband need to be a team -- you should have worked this out with him.", "YTA. You shouldn't have kicked her out without speaking with her dad first.\n\nHonestly, you should have just let her use the dress. Having people telling her how ridiculous it is that she looks like she is ready to marry her own father would be punishment enough.", "YTA. You threw his daughter out of HIS wedding. \n\nI don't care about the dress, or her brattyness. You threw your fianc\u00e9/husband's daughter out of HIS wedding. \n\nWhat, you were worried the party didn't match? That the photos would be off? Your perfect day wouldn't be all you hoped it would be? And instead of rolling with you you -- a 42-year-old adult -- decided to throw a tantrum because your precious wedding wasn't exactly how you wanted it. And you threw his daughter out of his wedding. \n\nI hope he gets the marriage annulled. You give zero craps about his feelings, and while it's too bad everything has been paid for, it's better to know that sooner than later.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The only people who do are \\[1\\] MILs who want to compete with the women \"taking away their darling child\" or \\[2\\] selfish narcissistic AHs who want to spoil the bride's special day by competing/drawing attention.\n\nIt's stupid of them, bc it highlights their personal insecurity and the lengths they are willing to go to to try to sabotage the bride. It usually backfires bc attendees recognise what a shitty thing it is to try to do to the bride.\n\nIn some ways, it's a shame you didn't just let her wear it and reap the caustic comments she would have got from your friends. 19 is old enough to deserve every one of them and no doubt a lot of red wine would have been 'accidently' spilled by your clumsy friends. As it is, she's managing to play the victim here.\n\nAn interesting point is how did she afford this competing wedding dress \"since she\u2019s in college and only works part time\"? Did whoever raised her pay for it? The grandparents? Was this a concerted plan by several people?\n\nWhat I find so annoying is how clueless men apparently are. I say apparently, bc it's hard to believe they've not picked up this nugget of wedding etiquette over the months of wedding preparation. I think it's a convenient excuse for them to ignore the bs pulled by their mothers/daughters/sisters etc.\n\nI'm sorry you husband is sulking; until he recognises *this was something his daughter deliberately chose to do to try to hurt you*, there's not much you can do. You can either sightsee solo, or you can fly home early. I would suggest you book online now for marriage counselling for as soon as you get back; it's worrying that you know each other so little, he defaulted to 'you are a horrible person for doing this to my precious princess'.\n\nIt's also worrying that his default is silent treatment rather than talking to you.

He may be being distant as he is sad that his daughter didn\u2019t come around and decided to pull this stunt. Rather than just upset at you.

Kicking stepdaughter out is not an option no matter how much of an AH she is. Mature way would've been to tell her you know she is pulling the stunt to hurt you and drive a wedge between you and hubby, and that you are disappointed and that after the wedding you want to have a  serious conversation with her about your relationships and her behavior. As an added plus, she would've made herself look like the AH and hubby would be angry with her rn, not you. I get it, weddings are emotional and stressful, and it's easy to say - superhuman to do.
