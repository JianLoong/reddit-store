I have been with my husband45 for 4 years. My husband has a daughter Shianna19.\n\nI had asked Shianna to be one of my bridesmaids. Her mom passed away when she was young, and I have always tried to have a connection with her, but she was always very against me. She\u2019s tried pinning us against each other for as long as I can remember or she just not friendly to me. I\u2019ve tried engaging with her in things I know she liked. I tried helping her with college tours. She actually spent 3 days at her grandmothers when she found out her father proposed to me. Nothing seemed to work till I asked her to be my bridesmaid. She was very excited which I was shocked by, but took this as my opportunity to bond.\n\nI chose a light blue for my bridesmaid dresses but let them pick the dress, and my husband bought Shiannas since she\u2019s in college and only works part time and was worried she wouldn\u2019t be able to afford an elegant enough dress for our wedding. My husband was very excited about his daughter being in the wedding as well.\n\nDay of the wedding, I have 2 other bridesmaids, my sister, and my best friend. I\u2019m getting my makeup done, and they come up to me and whisper that I have to see what shiannas wearing and to stay calm and not ruin my day. So I marched down to the room Shianna was in to see. She did not have the dress we bought her one, in fact she had a white long fluffy dress on, very similar to a wedding dress.\n\nI asked her what she was wearing and she just said \u201cI liked this one better, light blue is ugly.\u201d I was so mad, I told her she didn\u2019t match with the wedding party, and she needed to change if she wanted to be in the wedding. She just shook her head and said \u201cyou can\u2019t kick me out, my dads here.\u201d I said \u201cyou can stay all you want, but you won\u2019t be in the wedding party.\u201d We argued for a few minutes before I finally told her to go find a seat then because I didn\u2019t want her being one of my bridesmaids no more.\n\nShe got angry and instead left. After my husband noticed Shianna wasn\u2019t in the wedding he began acting weird. He was very cold and off the rest of the day, even after I explained what happened. \n\nWe\u2019re at this beautiful honeymoon resort in Florida and he slept most the plane ride, then when we got here we got into a big argument about Shianna being kicked out. He didn\u2019t see the white dress and the direct defiance as big of an issue as I did. She had texted him this BS excuse about how she didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be an issue and thought it\u2019d be okay. She even pointed out that I was probably worried she\u2019d look better then me and oh how she didn\u2019t wanna ruin my special day. \n\n We\u2019re not arguing anymore but he\u2019s still a little distant and we\u2019ve only even went out a few times because of it.  I feel like maybe I should\u2019ve just ignored the dress because now it\u2019s ruining my honeymoon.\n\nThe dress was similar to this: https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwj6tc3Snor9AhWh4IYKHZ7iCqkYABBDGgJ2dQ&ae=2&sig=AOD64_2DfKDv2B9JBGFPFxoJ7ZgLJVhZlw&adurl&ctype=5&ved=0CAQQ0LYHKCFqGAoTCPDToteeiv0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABC7Aw\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the support. I did show my husband this post and he admitted he may of made poor judgement and planned to talk to his daughter.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not sure if my husband told my stepdaughter about my post or not, but I have a comment from my stepdaughter or it may be someone posing as her. I\u2019m not using my original account so I\u2019m not sure how she would have found me, but I wouldn\u2019t give much attention to it!", "created_utc": 1676007268, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10yhcr6/aita_for_kicking_stepdaughter_out_of_my_wedding/", "score": 1208, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You chose and she lost. Sadly, you were unable to talk it out with your fianc\u00e9 before the actual ceremony so she may ultimately 'win' by breaking up your marriage. You and your husband need to talk this out with a professional so he can get an outside opinion. She is 19 and knew exactly what she was doing. NTA", "NTA.\n\nThat's just not okay. She knew exactly what she was doing. And she might succeed in breaking you up, if your husbond doesn't open his eyes.", "[removed]", "She bought a white dress? White?

Only the bride wears white to the wedding, that\u2019s common knowledge.  \n\nNTA", "NTA - your stepdaughter got herself thrown out, and I for one suspect that was her plan all along in a last ditch effort to sabotage your relationship.", "NTA she planned this. As soon as you asked her to be a bridesmaid, she said yes and started plotting her big entrance on your wedding day. His daughter is top shelf AH. And if he can't see that, I'd honestly reconsider that marriage. His grown adult daughter tried to upstage you at your wedding. That's just disgusting behavior and your husband needs to get his head out of his ass and have your back on this AND EVERY OTHER ATTEMPT at driving a wedge between you. \n\nShe's basically one of those people who doesn't want the surviving parent to ever find someone to spend their life with. She'll be perfectly happy being the only woman in his life even if that means he grows old alone and lonely.\n\nShe is selfish. And toxic. \n\nThis would be my hill to die on. She would have to apologize profusely or she would NOT be welcome in my house. \n\nYour husband did a shit job raising this brat. Tell him to handle it.", "Nta\n\nBut I'm petty enough to have the girl walk down the aisle in the white dress. A couple reasons for this. 1. She'd face off with nasty looks and comments from friends and family for her shenanigans. Most families would call her out directly for her behavior  and 2. Your husband would have seen the dress and her ploy to ruin your wedding, and it would have caused less stress on your honeymoon.

And you asked her to change and gave her an opportunity to be a part of the wedding and she refused. She kicked herself out. Anyone in your position would\u2019ve done the same thing. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

But also it should've been a no-brainer for him, because: of freaking course she can't be a bridesmaid in that getup!\n\nBut still...NTA because SHE IS A MANIPULATIVE CONTROLLING BACKSTABBING NARCISSIST for wearing a LiTeRaL wedding dress to a wedding and **as a bridesmaid** She obviously planned this and had time to say she didn't like the color. What the heck kind of bridesmaid changes dresses without consulting the bride? And ain't no bridesmaid thinking that's a good swap.\n\nAt the same time, it would've been sort of hilarious to let her walk the aisle. All the guests who don't know her be like, \"wait, am I at the wrong wedding?\"\ud83d\ude02 And then people would ask and you could tell them and they'd all judge what a nasty thing it was for her to do and ALSO say wow you were a good sport. Like people would talk about it for YEARS. You'd be a legend! But still, you aren't TA. She \ud83d\udcaf is.", "NTA but you played this all wrong. You should have requested you husband deal with it. You don't deal with his family, you make him do it as you deal with your own. You could have sent a text or the Maid of Honor to explain the situation and summon him to ask her to wear the right dress. You didn't even have to mention kicking her out, that's exactly what she wanted.\n\nIn the future, just defer to him when she does stuff, he's her father, it's his job. Don't even get sucked into text messages. My MIL once sent me this email insulting everything about me, I read the first paragraph, then forwarded it to my husband with the subject line, \"handle this\". Done and I didn't have anything to do with that power play.", "NTA.  Shots fired.  OP she crossed a line and there should be consequences like not extending anymore courtesies or monetary contributions.  People don't get rewarded for acting malicious then playing the victim.", "NTA She knew exactly what she was doing when she got that dress. I bet she did this so you'd kick her out of the bridal party in order to cause trouble between you and her dad.  Her dad is being naive about her motives.", "NTA but as others pointed out, you should have just let her embarrass herself", "If her plot (and I\u2019m sure she had one) was to wreck your wedding/honeymoon,she nailed it. I\u2019m sorry,it seems like you really tried but this person is your enemy. The only question is\u2026does that make your new husband one? He NEEDS to understand what a rotten thing she did on your wedding day and needs to recognize the way this is. If not,this marriage is already in trouble.", "NTA - and good for you for kicking her out of the wedding party. It is very common knowledge that wearing a white dress to someone else\u2019s wedding is absolutely unacceptable. You do not do that - ever - without permission from the bride.\n\nYour husband is SO wrong to be upset at you for this. His daughter tried to pull a nasty little stunt to ruin the wedding - she knew exactly what she was doing. He really needs to take the blinders off where his daughter is concerned.", "NTA\n\nShe clearly knew what she was doing. I would suggest addressing this with a neutral mediator for this. It is going to be hard for your husband to accept that his daughter tried to destroy his wedding and by extension marriage.", "NTA but it sounds like she succeeded in sabotaging your marriage either way. She really did put you in a no win situation.", "NTA\n\nBut your husband needed to see what his daughter was doing.  You had multiple witnesses with what happened so at least you have that.\n\nThe stupid thing is that if you had've let her just walk down the aisle in her wedding dress, she would've just looked like a right royal dick and people would not be looking very favourably on her.\n\nYou've got some difficult decisions to make depending on what happens now.  Your husband is caught between a rock and a hard place and he missed the actual bad behaviour and may side with his daughter.  You may need to give her enough rope to hang herself in the future... if there is a future.", "She wasn't \"kicked out\" of the wedding.\n\nNTA. \n\nYour husband may nor be The One though.", "NTA - but I would encourage you to restate what happened to you kicked her out of the wedding party due to her act of defiance, and she was the one that chose to leave the wedding itself. \n\nI agree that she was likely looking for you to make a bigger deal (ie kick her out entirely) instead of just leaving her off the wedding party.  Not to say that I am petty but.... this would have been a case where if your bridesmaids were more on it they would have had a whoopsy with red wine too close to that dress....", "NTA- Show him this post.\n\nIf he can\u2019t accept what she did was wrong i\u2019d re-evaluate this marriage.", "ESH.  White dress was an AH move, but ~~kicking her out~~ (edit:) removing her as a bridesmaid without talking to your husband was not cool.  You and your husband need to be a team -- you should have worked this out with him.", "YTA. You shouldn't have kicked her out without speaking with her dad first.\n\nHonestly, you should have just let her use the dress. Having people telling her how ridiculous it is that she looks like she is ready to marry her own father would be punishment enough.", "YTA. You threw his daughter out of HIS wedding. \n\nI don't care about the dress, or her brattyness. You threw your fianc\u00e9/husband's daughter out of HIS wedding. \n\nWhat, you were worried the party didn't match? That the photos would be off? Your perfect day wouldn't be all you hoped it would be? And instead of rolling with you you -- a 42-year-old adult -- decided to throw a tantrum because your precious wedding wasn't exactly how you wanted it. And you threw his daughter out of his wedding. \n\nI hope he gets the marriage annulled. You give zero craps about his feelings, and while it's too bad everything has been paid for, it's better to know that sooner than later.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As it is, she's managing to play the victim here.\n\nAn interesting point is how did she afford this competing wedding dress \"since she\u2019s in college and only works part time\"?

Did you make sure to explain that you only asked her to sit out of the wedding party but she chose to leave on her own instead? \n\nI had a white dress situation at my wedding. \n\nMy husband has an evil stepmother. We asked his stepbrothers to be ushers at our wedding because they are good guys and we gave them all plus ones because I got along with their wives/girlfriends. But one had a clueless girlfriend who is sort of \"trashy\" we will call her Ellie. She uses bad language everywhere, covered in tattoos and wears really skimpy clothes where her nipples often come flying out because she's very well endowed and doesn't cover up securely. She's a very sweet girl and I didn't have any problems with her as a person - we got along fine. \n\nAt my wedding, Ellie came back to say hello after I had put on my wedding dress. Just to say - hey we're all here and you look beautiful, etc.. She was wearing a white dress - it was beautiful but it was very skimpy and barely covered her breasts. \n\nLuckily, I'm a quick thinker. This is what ran through my head: 1) She doesn't know any better, 2) this has evil stepmother in law written all over it, 3) the stepmother is counting on me to make a scene about this so she can say more bad things about me to the family. \n\nSo I made a quick decision. I smiled and hugged her and thanked her for coming all this way to be with me on my special day. I told her I hope she enjoys the wedding and to save a dance for me. She giggled at that and then was off to find her seat. \n\nThe stepmother-in-law tried many other things to ruin the wedding that weekend - she made my mother-in-law cry by telling her that I didn't want her to be honored as mother of the bride. She tried to get lost on the way to the wedding in the completely wrong direction so they would miss it. She tried to say she was getting sick from the food at the wedding reception and create a food poisoning scare. She tried to tell the photographer which family members I wanted photos of most and they were all her friends and family that I had no relationships with (luckily I had discussed this all with my photographer in detail because we both had two full sets of parents). \n\nAll in all, we were prepared and we met each challenge graciously and therefore she wasn't able to ruin the wedding as she intended. \n\nI hope things work out with your husband and you can remember going forward - no matter what that girl does, she is his daughter - his flesh and blood. You should meet every behavior and every offense graciously. There's no better way to foil someone's plans to make you look bad than to refuse to act badly. \n\nI would talk to your husband and say, \"Look - it's wrong to wear white to someone else's wedding and I was shocked and startled that she came ready to do that - in the female world that's like declaring war - but I admit I could have handled this better and I'm sorry that I wasn't able to think of a better way to respond in the moment, but I'll try to do better about this going forward.\"\n\nThen just refuse to let her get in between you two by trying to provoke a negative response from you. If you don't defend yourself, you give your husband an opportunity to see the contrasting behavior between you both and make a decision for himself.

Even if your husband was too obtuse to realize how inappropriate her dress was on her own, he would have heard from many others. You would have come out smelling like fucking roses, and she would have looked like the obviously insensitive asshole that she is. (I know not helpful in hindsight, but perhaps a lesson for the future.) Yes, you would have had some weird photos from your wedding, and you had every right to react the way you did, but she got everything she wanted - she didn\u2019t want to be in the wedding anyway. She got out of it, ruined your wedding day and most importantly, came out looking like the victim to your husband. \n\nMoving forward, if it was me, I\u2019d adopt this strategy of being a rock (a technique to deal with someone in your life who is NPD or BPD but with whom you can\u2019t or don\u2019t yet want to go NC). Nothing she says or does bothers you. Have no emotional reactions that are negative. Do not get angry. If she does anything next level to get attention or disrupt, let it happen and your husband deal with it. (Yes, this is incredibly difficult, but you can do it. Get help from a therapist, take up meditation, etc.) If you had applied this strategy on your wedding day, you would have had zero negative reaction, let her wear the dress and let the chips fall. Assuming you can and want to smooth things over with your husband, more issues are definitely going to arise. \n\nTry to reframe her behavior in your mind and be generous with understanding why she\u2019s so difficult. She lost her mom young, and she\u2019s still essentially a kid. She likely would have treated anyone like this, so her behavior is about her, not you specifically. If you use the rock method, she will eventually stop acting out because she won\u2019t elicit a reaction from you at all (that\u2019s the point - You Are Inert), and it will become boring. Give her space (you\u2019re not and don\u2019t have to be her parent, you just have to coexist in each other\u2019s orbit). And finally, be as kind as you can make yourself towards her. When she gets older, hopefully she will regret her behavior, and realize that there\u2019s room for many kinds of family relationships, including one with you. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA", "NTA your daughter was trying to ruin your wedding.", "This is not just a wedding incident.

They are expected to act and dress accordingly if expressed by the bride and groom.

Thinking her relation to him would push you into dealing with her disrespect and she was trying to extort it.\n\nI feel like In situations like this , it's not even the act itself but the foul intentions that are so clearly implied, that are considered disrespectful and nasty. Sure changing her dress wasn't bad but she chose a dress that was nothing like the theme of your wedding and worse a wedding dress. Not horrible horrible  but the disrespect is practically thrown in your face \n\nNot hard to think why your husband wouldn't immediately get your side since he hadn't seen it all but once he truly listened I'm glad he came around and decided to face this.\n\n I'm sorry y'all were so upset during this supposed to be happy time.  Thankfully y'all have the rest of your lives to make up for that one bad day.\n\nSeems ike you and your husband are working it out.

You probably should have had your fiance talk to her at the time too so you could be on the same page. I can understand why your husband is upset. He wanted his daughter in the wedding.
