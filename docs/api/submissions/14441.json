I think people that have very strict dietary requirements should be prepared to either not eat or bring their own food. I understand ordering some plain cheese pizza and a couple pepperoni or whatever but if you have more extreme restrictions you can\u2019t expect everyone to cater to you.

So they don't feel left out.", "NTA but let invitees know your menu plan ahead of time so no one gets surprised. It might also work if you made it a potluck, and ask people to bring food that **they** can eat.

Vegan , keto the only one I'd truly worry about 1oo% accommodating is any food allergies/sensitivities such as the gluten free. \n\nThat said it's always a good idea to offer a vegi platter and at least 3 different sorts of pizza perhaps a meatlovers so the keto can pick off the meats and cheese and eat them , a vegetarian/ vegan and a cheese?", "Gluten Free you definitely need to accomodate if they are gluten intolerant or have celiacs.   Keto is not usually a medical reason so barring any medical reasons surely the person can eat whatever for a party.", "NTA - I agree with others who are saying you can go with a veggie tray or something that isn't dinner.

If you\u2019re only there for 2 hours schedule it in mid morning or mid afternoon and just have appropriate cupcakes and maybe some chips or something.

Save the embarrassment by not at all recommending that.\n\nIdk what you can really do about this situation\u2026 it mainly depends on how strict their dietary restrictions are.\n\nYou did say the rental is a 2hr window, hopefully they are happy to eat beforehand considering it\u2019s a child\u2019s bday.", "I would explain that there is no reasonable accommodations for vegan and gluten-free meals.

Isn't there easy food like bread, some vegetables and some of those cupcakes you mentioned?", "NTA: people with niche dietary restrictions shouldn't be expected to be catered to. creating options for them with the cupcakes lets them know you care. they should understand you can't do it all", "Get a vegetable pizza without cheese. Problem solved. The gluten free ones can just scrape the toppings off the crust. Also, tell them if they are that picky, bring their own food. \n\nBetter Yet, just order Pizza, and assume everyone likes it. Act like terms vegan and gluten free are foreign to you. Life is hard enough. Enjoy it, and eat pizza.\n\nGluten sensitivity is a scam, and celiac disease isn't a real disease, Google it. It's a toxic reaction to Monsanto Round Up, you ever hear of Monsanto, or no?\n\nVeganism destroys the environment and is not a natural human diet, as we have similar digestive systems as dogs, or canine.
