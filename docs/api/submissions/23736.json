We lived on the east coast for about 10 years for my husband's job then wanted to move back to the west coast to be near family. We had plans to move to an area that was three hours from where family lives because I have a very difficult relationship with my parents and didn't want to be too close.\n\nSo the time came that we needed to drive across the country to drop off some of our belongings that we couldn't ship and my husband announced that he no longer wanted to move to the area we agreed on. He wanted to be closer to his parents and have them more involved with our kids. I would never have agreed to move if I had known we would end up back in our hometown. I was so hurt and felt I had no choice. My husband makes all of the money so I felt like there was nothing I could do but just go along with it. We just sold our home.\n\nWe moved to an apartment while we tried to find a house and finally found one we loved. It was an older home (1920s) and we were really excited. We had an inspection and just found out about minor issues. After purchasing, we had some major issues. The paint that was cracked and peeling was actually lead paint. There was asbestos. We really messed up with this purchase...\n\nMy husband said he would take care of it and hired professionals to encapsulate and drywall. The drywall guys made an absolute mess and I tested the chips on the ground for lead and they were positive. The drywall workers said they didn't know there was lead in the house. I don't think my husband even confirmed this with them. I begged him to please get someone to help him clean the mess since it was everywhere and he said no he could handle it himself. He promised to hepa vacuum the entire house. He said I couldn't help because I stress him out. He vacuumed and then we moved our furniture in. Once there, I noticed he skipped three rooms and there were paint chips all over. He admitted he didn't vacuum those areas because he assumed they were fine because the workers weren't in there. \n\nNow our house AND all of our furniture is contaminated and he promises again to take care of it. I said I don't trust him. There are so many issues he keeps dismissing. There are lead chips in the yard he is ignoring because he \"can't fix everything.\" This is not just a home for the two of us but our kids need to live there. He promises to take care of stuff then doesn't do it. He forgets everything. Another example is we had a bear outside of the apartment complex and I said DO NOT LET OUR SON OUT TO PLAY. Twenty minutes later he let him outside. He forgot.\n\nWe've had the house for three months and I said I'm not living in the house. I told him he made a big decision that hurt me (moving back home) and I needed to make this decision. I said we can try to sell or rent and hire someone to take care of the place but I'm not staying there with someone who can't do fix things properly and put our family at risk.\n\nEdit: he said it will be safe enough and he will do it but I just \"keep coming up with new stuff to fix\" aka safety hazards. We have nowhere else to live and just spent an insane amount of money on this house.\n\nEdit 2: I have mental health issues that I feel he is always using against me. I have anxiety and OCD. Whenever I have a concern, he dismisses it and says it is my anxiety/ocd and I'm going over the top with the lead stuff. He said most people live in houses with lead and don't go through all of this trouble.\n\nEdit 3: he just said I'm privileged for not moving into an expensive house we just bought AND that we shouldn't have tested and just moved in because we would all be fine\n\nEdit 4: we had the asbestos removed.

It should be in your purchase agreement. Check your documents thoroughly to make sure it's either on there or not, and whether or not you signed it. If it's not in there, or you didn't sign it, You need to consult with a real estate attorney ASAP.
