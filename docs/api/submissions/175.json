I've been letting him stay for free. \n\nHe has been a good roommate overall, being quiet and clean. However, he asks to go out a lot to explore the city and we have been going to bars and restaurants very frequently. He has been good about splitting the bill down the middle, but he is very very quick to always Venmo me half of every single uber ride, drink, meal, etc. that we do.\n\nHe is about to leave, and I told him that it's been really nice hosting him but I've also allowed him to stay for three weeks for completely free and going out so frequently has been expensive for me, and that it'd appreciate it if he's willing to treat me to a nice dinner & drinks just once before he leaves instead of constantly Venmoing me for my half. \n\nHe got upset at me, saying I didn't give any expectation that he would have to \"treat me\" and that I am being \"passive aggressive\" and that he's \"not a mind reader\" and he has been Venmoing me and splitting the bill on things because that's the right thing to do (which I don't dispute). I said I wasn't that upset, but it would be a good faith gesture because I like to treat whoever hosts me and he's stayed a while, but he thinks it's rude of me to ask that of him \"especially as he is still trying to land a job\" (although he has been paying for his half of the meals through savings), and that my comment may make us end our time together on a \"bad note.\" \n\nI understand that he is not objectively doing anything wrong - I told him he could crash for free for three weeks and he has been splitting all the bills. But I would have liked a gesture of goodwill or thoughtfulness of him treating me out at least once, and once I asked that of him, he found it rude and aggressive and \"entitled.\" \n\nWhat do you think?", "created_utc": 1667267505, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yivisk/aita_for_telling_my_friend_whos_been_crashing_on/", "score": 6, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like he said, you didn't set an expectation that he would owe you anything beyond paying his fair share. Also, you chose to go out with him every time he wanted to go. He didn't make you spend that money, so the fact that's it's been expensive going out is irrelevant since it was completely your choice. I'm a firm believer that you should never hold a nice deed over someone, or score keeping, as its know.\n\nHowever, you didn't get angry and call him a bum or anything, you just expressed your desire to be treated as a thank you. Which is weird, but could've been worse.\n\nSo, soft TYA, borderline NAH.", "ESH. He should\u2019ve naturally done that on his own, it\u2019s common sense. But it\u2019s weird to ask him to do that, you just shouldn\u2019t have said anything", "Yikes, buddy. Your friend is sofa surfing and looking for a job. He made a big ask - to sofa surf for 3 weeks. You accepted. Although I accept that it may cost you a touch more in power and water bills (or not if you pay the base rate as a single person in a dwelling), we're talking maybe $20 in extra out of pocket costs. He's done his best to be the model roommate and inconvenience you as little as possible, while also treating you not like a AirBNB but like a friend and someone he wants to spend time with. What might have made sense as a thank you gift would be a potted plant, or a hand written note of gratitude and appreciation. Definitely not meals and drinks for 2 to celebrate you for being the best human ever /sarcasm. \n\nA good person - even someone not close to this guy - would want to help him towards success and recovery for whatever reason he's sofa surfing and trying to get a job. \n\nYTA.", "You have saved him hundreds of dollars, I would never impose on a friend for that period of time without at least taking them to dinner. \n\nI don't know that l would ask them to take me to dinner as a thank you if they didn't offer.

Not to mention he has been paying for half of everything through his savings, and doesn't have a job or any way of bringing in more money. Yet, you want him to treat you out for drinks and dinner... This man can't even afford his own half of a meal, and you want him to pay for *two meals and drinks.*\n\nThe least you could've done was wait until he landed a job and got a paycheck or two in.", "YTA if treating you to a night out was the price of staying with you then you should have told him that. If you do a nice thing for someone you should do it without expecting anything back. Sure it would have been nice for him to offer but he didn\u2019t. So suck it up.", "ESH It's pretty tacky to stay with someone for three whole weeks and then do nothing to really thank the host. It is customary to take someone out to dinner, and given how long he was staying, treating you to dinner at least once was called for.\n\nBut it's not the kind of thing you can really bring up or ask for...So I guess you were both at fault here.", "NTA. You were a good host. What sucks is that you had to ask at all. A considerate friend/guest would\u2019ve offered to treat you at least once. Imo, he\u2019s the one causing the bad note ending. But hey, lesson learned.", "NTA. he is cheap and no one ever taught him to be gracious. The right thing to do is to leave a hostess gift. Or at least treat you to a meal.", "Kinda ta, because all of the financial issues should have been discussed weeks ago.  How was he to know that you were overspending during the last 3 weeks if you haven't told him?\n\nYes,  he should compensate you,  but your overspending is not his fault and your request may be causing him to overspend,  or would that make it even,", "Entitled much? You could've said \"NO\" when asked to go out to exploring/boozing/cruising.  Maybe he was going to plan something/gift you something to say thanks? YTA", "A very very very light YTA.  Just don\u2019t host next time. Or say something later. It doesn\u2019t seem like too big a deal\u2026. That being said\u2026.\n\n\nHe is also TA because if you stay with someone for even a few nights, something is customary. Even if it\u2019s \u201chey first round is on me\u201d every so often.   The gesture is more important IMO.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
