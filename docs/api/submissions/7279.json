She used the situation to push her agenda to talk bad about you.  Now she's embarrassed by her actions - especially since her \"assumptions\" as to why you needed to lay down were wrong - but not big enough to admit it or apologize.

But, you might not get one.  Do you really want to hang out with someone who will quickly and easily assume you are alcoholic and then tell everyone else that as if it\u2019s the truth?  Sure, it\u2019s reasonable to have to respect her need for privacy with her trauma. But where was her respect for your privacy?  If she were mature about it, she could easily say \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for publicly accusing you of being alcoholic. I\u2019m a little sensitive about it given some past trauma.  I hope you can understand and forgive.\u201d\n\nShe feels no remorse for what she did. Instead, she seems to reserve the right to judge others\u2019 drinking AND be at parties where people drink. So, she might do that or something like it again. You might need to stop inviting Katie and Lance to events.", "NTA..it is not anyone's job but Katie's to deal with her trauma.

To this day, my only guess is that somebody slipped me something because two beers was not even a start to the night for me back then. Two beers was more like what I had to get ready to get ready to start drinking. Yet, I was passed out for like 5 hours. People were partying around me, and I have slight glimpses of that. I also got gum all over my buddy's bed, lol. That was like 25 years ago, and it is one of my life's mysteries.\n\n\nWho knows, maybe I was sick as well.

Honestly it sounds like she was trying to deflect from the fact that she herself had been drinking or that she has an issue with you and decided to take your absence as an opportunity to let her inner 13 year old mean girl go wild. \n\nLook I can understand how being around someone she thinks (apparently without any reason) is an alcoholic could be upsetting/triggering/pick your word of choice. But announcing that your alcoholism makes her uncomfortable to everyone she could find isn't going to help someone she supposedly thinks needs help, and it's not a normal response to her feeling triggered. If she were upset or triggered enough that she couldn't behave with some decorum and keep her concerns to herself (or herself and her husband, or herself and your husband, etc. etc.) I'm assuming the door was easily accessible and she could have gotten out of dodge. \n\nI don't think anyone has to disclose something from the past that has deeply affected them, but it's not a free pass to behave poorly, hurt other people and then declare 'oh no I have trauma and I'm not accepting further questions at this time. It's also very suspicious that she's been to parties where people are drinking before and this issue apparently didn't pop up, but suddenly when you're no longer in the room she just couldn't possibly control herself from voicing her concerns. If her decision not to (usually) drink at parties stems from an incident where she got hammered and did something humiliating, her past trigger excuse is an even odder thing to suddenly bring up.", "That friend just became an exfriend for what she did.

Did Katie just pick on OP because OP was out of the room?", "Did you say Katie had an incident at another party she was embarrassed of? So you stocked up non alcoholic drinks expecting her not to drink? But she took two shots?\n\nShe sounds like an old friend of mine. And the trauma with the drunk person was herself because she was an alcoholic who fell off the wagon a few times, remembered how bad it was and then projected and appointed herself the booze monitor for everyone else.\n\nI would assume you are not getting an apology because Katie is not ready to admit her own relationship with alcohol. I\u2019d stop hanging out with her because she\u2019s going to \u2018prove\u2019 your \u2018problem\u2019 as much as often alcoholics use \u2018prove\u2019 they can do Dry January to distract from the real issue.\n\nNTA. I do think the disclose your trauma thing is a bit odd as someone with PTSD but I also suspect your group senses she is bullshitting something and pushing becsuse they heard other stuff or she started lecturing them while you were laid down and they aren\u2019t keen. You don\u2019t get to yell \u2018triggered\u2019 and be an AH and just get absolution. You still have to acknowledge and/or apologise.\n\nAnd I say this as someone who drank heavily to cope with PTSD before I knew what it was.

She needs to publicly apologize just has she publicly lied about you.", "INFO\n\nI\u2019m a bit curious, did you ever figure out why your dog\u2019s liver enzymes were so high?", "That's an awfully lame excuse from Katie.", "NTA, her trauma is completely and utterly irrelevant. You had a bad time with a drunk person, that has nothing to do with being a rude asshole and going around a party saying the host is a drunk.\n\nIf you have a trauma and have a problem, leave, or stop attending parties where people will obviously drink, it doesn't give you permission to be rude nor an excuse to not apologise for being rude.", "NTA - I have PTSD, so I'm gonna weigh in with a little tidbit of wisdom: Having triggers sucks, but it is ultimately your responsibility to avoid them. Going to a party where you know people will be drinking when people drinking is a trigger for you is wildly irresponsible on her part. Especially if she has never once communicated that with you. \n\nIf you want to go the mature route, you can always say something like \"Katie, I apologize for triggering you, but it's unfair for you to be angry at me for triggering you when you didn't communicate your boundaries. Myself and other's can't be expected to read your mind, and it was very rude to make disparaging and untrue comments about me because of that. Those were uncalled for, even if trauma triggered it. You don't have to share details of your trauma if it makes you uncomfortable, but it's not right to hold us accountable when we didn't know, and to expect that your hurtful words should just be ignored.\"", "op=NTA\n\nHer triggers are her problem.  Bad mouthing in YOUR HOME is just A-H behavior--if she's so darn triggered-solution was to LEAVE.\n\nAnd then to not be willing to apologize.  \n\nSo your EAR INFECTION triggered her.  So sorry to hear that. s/\n\n<<Katie doesn't want to interact with us if we ask for an apology>>  Good riddance.", "Alcoholics do not necessarily need alcohol to function. Alcoholism is not really defined by what you drink, when you drink it, or even how much you drink. It's the effects of your drinking that define a problem. Alcoholism isn\u2019t the same as alcohol dependence, though they may overlap (virtually all who are dependent would be alcoholics, but not all alcoholics are dependent). There are even sober alcoholics (AA calls them dry drunks).", "NTA - She owes you an apology\u2026past trauma or not. We all have past trauma in some form. No excuse to be an AH. Additionally, she obviously wasn\u2019t that uncomfortable if she continued to stay in your home and talked *ish about you at your party. If you made her that uncomfortable, she should have left. If she does not apologize, I would not invite her to any more events. Your husband should have your back on this one. Btw - What was he doing when Katie called you an alcoholic? Why did she even feel comfortable doing so in front of him (and in your house)?", "Katie is 26 if she has such trauma that she can't handle it she shouldn't be at parties where there is alcohol yet.  To be called an alcoholic over an ear infection even if you happened to get drunk to get drunk isn't necessarily an alcoholic.  She needs to continue therapy.  She isn't ready to adult at parties yet.", "NTA She won\u2019t apologize, so it\u2019s a waste of time to keep demanding it. She\u2019s an ah and won\u2019t miraculously change and become a better person.", "NTA. She doesn't need to disclose the specifics of her trauma in order to apologize.", "NTA and time to cut Lance and Katie loose!", "NTA, but please consider postponing any thoughts of marriage for a few years.  At least until you're ready to be with a partner with whom you can be yourself completely without fear of disapproval or shame.  Until you understand fully that you need and deserve such a partner, and that a partner from whom you have to hide your work is not the partner for you.  Please, please don't even consider marrying a woman who wouldn't understand that a person raised with less financial privilege that she was (and which still cushions her in her pre-independent, pre-adulthood)  needs to have a job, and if that's a job in fast food, there is absolutely nothing, zero, nada, zip to be ashamed of!  And then, there's her hypocrisy.  Don't do this to yourself.", "So here's a cool idea - if Katie does not want to be around people who drink on a party, she can always not come to the party. She should definitely apologize, disclosing her trauma when she does not feel comfortable is different thing. I am pretty surprised she took two shots if thats the case though. NTA", "A high five is in order. You have reached a milestone.", "NTA she put her triggers onto other people, basically she was projecting all over you. She owes an apology.

Katie doesn't sound like much of a friend IMO.", "Forget the apology.  Given Katie and Lance have said, if she made an apology, it would not be sincere.

She 1,000% needs to apologize for her antics. I do, however, feel like Y W B T A if you tried to force her to reveal her past traumas. It feels super icky that the group thinks that\u2019s a reasonable demand; she shouldn\u2019t have to do that. But of course, if she wants to stay mum and not offer insight about her trauma around people consuming alcohol around her, then she also needs to stay mum with her judgments/accusations/false narratives\u2026 or she needs to stay home."]}
