By your admission, she has covered an entire months rent for 6 months, and there likely were other financial benefits provided by her.  Food, gas, entertainment expenses.

You should return the favor and she shouldn't even have to ask.", "YTA she helped you big time.

While I understand your reasoning it's not right. When you said you only asked her once or twice you sound ungrateful. Also what would you have done if she didn't cover your rent? As a couple which is a partnership you should help her. Her savings are not the point. It's what a couple does for one another. Especially someone who helped you as much as she did. She isn't asking to be paid back. She's asking for what she did for you. If she wasn't be laid off so quickly after your issues I'm sure she would never have brought it up. Also didn't she only ask for you to cover for one month? I don't see the issue you are having. Instead of her having to feel guilty because she knows you don't want to you should have just said no.", "YTA! Unless you Really can't cover her half of the rent 1 time, and maybe more, to be reluctant to extend the help you received from her 6 times already is totally a*****ish behavior, regardless of yours or her savings amount.

Its not a competition dude and treating it that way will only push her way. You support your partner when its needed (as long as its not taking the piss) just like she did with you. \n\nIt weird to flinch in that situation and become fixated on how she has more money than you.

She helped you out for 6 months with rent and expenses allowing you to not only avoid more credit card debt but to also pay it off, and now that she is in a financial bind because of a sudden job loss you first instinct is to not help her because she has more in her saving than you do.

Nope. You're talking like she has 1 million stashed away. Personally, if I only had 10k, I wouldn't have covered your rent. But she did.

She's not saying this is her long term plan or that you can't reassess it if she doesn't get a job this month. She's asking for some breathing room. \n\n2. Savings accounts are more valuable if you don't draw from them. Yes, those savings should be a cushion but again for ONE month, its better overall to let it sit.\n\n3. Just because a gift requires no repayment doesn't mean you're not showing yourself to be the less supportive partner here. When the chips were down, she treated her money as \"both people\" money.

Voicing your discomfort with an uncomfortable financial situation is okay. Obviously she\u2019s done much more for you, and you owe her at least this.

For her, possibly your discomfort says that you're not happy to sacrifice for her, even though she happily sacrificed for you for 6 months.

I can understand her reluctancy to touch her savings, but they're there for a reason, and she has more than you and she will be able to earn back those money at some point anyways.\n\nFor now I'd say she can cover her part of the rent herself without your help. She did go out of her way to help you when you were in a tight spot, and you should ready for if a moment arises when she truly needs your help in return.

And reading the comments about you saving for a car it makes sense. \n\nDepending on the job market she might have a job rather fast, she has savings and you will support her. However using the \"she supported you\" argument when you've only asked once or twice isn't fair.. She chose to do so. Is it courteous to make it even? Yes, and you are. \n\nBut being uncomfortable doesn't make you an asshole. Especially when she ASKED how you felt about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA if you feel this way, but sort that out fam", "I'm going to be down voted for this one. But hopefully you see it OP. I'm going with NTA for now, a potential y.t.a in the future. Let me explain.\n\nThis topic is more of a financial advice needed than an AITA. I believe you and your girlfriend aren't at the same level when it comes to financial education. This explains what I'm viewing as 'panic' about supporting your girlfriend for a month. \n\nFirst, let me explain that $10k of GF's savings. That is an emergency fund. Probably 3-6 months of expenses. This should NOT be touched unless there is no choice. This fund is for true emergencies, the only car get totalled or both of you lose your jobs. \n\nYou guys just need a budget conversation with a spreadsheet or pen and paper. \n\nData for spreadsheet:\nWhat is your monthly income? \nWhat is your average monthly expenses?\nWhat needs to go into your savings for another car? \nWhat needs to go into your retirement? \nWhat outstanding debits/loans needs to be paid off? \nWhat needs to stay in your emergency fund? \nWhat is your GF average monthly expenses? \nWhat is your GF saving for? \nWhat needs to go into her retirement? \nWhat debit and loans does your GF have to pay off? \nWhat needs to stay in GF emergency fund? \n\nOnline you can find budget templates available to download. Also, maybe listening to some of Dave Ramsey's 6 steps videos might help you. I personally don't agree with everything he says. But to get a person financially stable it is a good plan. \n\nKeep in mind, budget conversations aren't a one and done sort of deal. This needs to continue to happen at least annually. \n\nNow, relationship advice. If you don't have the above budget conversation and explain your panic about covering her rent it will lead her to resent you. She covered you for 6 months. She is asking for 1 month. If that means not saving up for a second car for 1-2 months, or cutting down on expenses to cover her rent then do it. She needs to feel safe and in a partnership with you. Right, it is leaning towards you are leaching off of her. And it will appear more like that if you don't explain where you are financially. \n\nIf you truly don't have a strong financial education like I'm assuming then NTA. But please take some of the advice given. \n\nIf you know all of this and still don't want to cover her. Than Y.T.A.", "NTA, u didn't say no, u pointed out that it is a big deal and it makes you unconfortable", "I'd say probably NTA, but you should probably just sit down with each other and try to understand each person's expectations and concerns about shared finances and expenses, including your means to pay.\n\nHave you told her all the stuff you told us, above?\n\nOne concern I'd have: It sounds like she's given you a lot, financially, and you could come across as ungracious if she asks you for financial assistance during a very stressful time and you get cold feet.\n\nI suspect you feel nervous and stressed about money in general at this point. You struggled with financial difficulties, and you're in a relationship with someone who helped you climb out of that. That may have caused you to already been nervous about the subject.\n\nJust talk about this stuff. Listen to each other. I bet just talking about it would do you both a lot of good. And remember, figuring out how you'll handle mutual finances is part of a relationship, and it can be different for every relationship.\n\nEarly on, you can get by without raising issues, because you're not entwined as much financially. But as you go further into a relationship, sharing space and bills and handling financial matters as partners, you eventually should talk about feelings about money, resources, how to make plans about money together, whether to have separate accounts, joint ones, or both, all that yucky stuff. It's uncomfortable to talk about money stuff, but when you're intimate with someone, when you're in a partnership, that should be someone you can open up to about even filthy lucre.", "NTA - It\u2019s hard to excuse yourself on your feelings. Although it\u2019s a fair exchange, that shouldn\u2019t change how you feel nor make her feel guilty. \n\nIf you are committed you support one another- financially, emotionally, and physically. If one of you on your own cannot cover the rent, you\u2019re probably living above your means- make a commitment to one another to always be in a place either one of you can leave a bad situation at work if you need to- no one wants to be a wage slave.", "No.  Valid concern.  Just keep talking through it and be honest.", "NAH - your feelings may be a tad selfish but at the end of the day you agreed to return the favor that she once did for you (although important to recognize she helped you out to a much larger degree), and honestly explained your thoughts about feeling insecure about your savings.
