By your admission, she has covered an entire months rent for 6 months, and there likely were other financial benefits provided by her.  Food, gas, entertainment expenses.  You've been living together for over 3 years.  \n\nNow it's her turn to have a crisis, and asks you to cover her for a single month, only rent, and you flinched.\n\nYour instinct is to immediately calculate that there's no personal benefit for you, and to recoil from it.  I truly hope for her sake this is the confrontation that ends the relationship.   This level of selfishness doesn't get resolved with therapy.

You should return the favor and she shouldn't even have to ask.", "YTA she helped you big time. You've also been together long enough that marriage should be on the horizon, and yet, you don't want to return the favor. You are where you are financially because of her.

While I understand your reasoning it's not right. When you said you only asked her once or twice you sound ungrateful. Also what would you have done if she didn't cover your rent? As a couple which is a partnership you should help her. Her savings are not the point. It's what a couple does for one another. Especially someone who helped you as much as she did. She isn't asking to be paid back. She's asking for what she did for you. If she wasn't be laid off so quickly after your issues I'm sure she would never have brought it up. Also didn't she only ask for you to cover for one month? I don't see the issue you are having. Instead of her having to feel guilty because she knows you don't want to you should have just said no.", "YTA! Unless you Really can't cover her half of the rent 1 time, and maybe more, to be reluctant to extend the help you received from her 6 times already is totally a*****ish behavior, regardless of yours or her savings amount.

Its not a competition dude and treating it that way will only push her way. You support your partner when its needed (as long as its not taking the piss) just like she did with you. \n\nIt weird to flinch in that situation and become fixated on how she has more money than you.

Nope. You're talking like she has 1 million stashed away. Personally, if I only had 10k, I wouldn't have covered your rent. But she did. Now you have to suck it up and return the favour.", "I do understand your reluctantance but I would say YTA for a few reasons \n\n1. Shes asking you to cover one month. She's not saying this is her long term plan or that you can't reassess it if she doesn't get a job this month. She's asking for some breathing room. \n\n2. Savings accounts are more valuable if you don't draw from them. Yes, those savings should be a cushion but again for ONE month, its better overall to let it sit.\n\n3. Just because a gift requires no repayment doesn't mean you're not showing yourself to be the less supportive partner here. When the chips were down, she treated her money as \"both people\" money.

Voicing your discomfort with an uncomfortable financial situation is okay. Obviously she\u2019s done much more for you, and you owe her at least this.

For her, possibly your discomfort says that you're not happy to sacrifice for her, even though she happily sacrificed for you for 6 months.

She does have savings, so it's not like she'd go bankrupt if you hadn't been able to help her out. I can understand her reluctancy to touch her savings, but they're there for a reason, and she has more than you and she will be able to earn back those money at some point anyways.\n\nFor now I'd say she can cover her part of the rent herself without your help. She did go out of her way to help you when you were in a tight spot, and you should ready for if a moment arises when she truly needs your help in return.

Are they forgetting that you didn't say no? You said you would, just that you're slightly uncomfortable with it.. And reading the comments about you saving for a car it makes sense. \n\nDepending on the job market she might have a job rather fast, she has savings and you will support her. However using the \"she supported you\" argument when you've only asked once or twice isn't fair.. She chose to do so. Is it courteous to make it even? Yes, and you are. \n\nBut being uncomfortable doesn't make you an asshole. Especially when she ASKED how you felt about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The reason it\u2019s not a valid argument is because you accepted her covering your rent for 6 months already. This means either one of two things: \n1) you owe her a debt to the amount of 6 months of rent - you can pay now or in monthly instalments\n2) you\u2019re partners (which you claim you are) and you have now entered an agreement where when one of you is struggling financially you work it out together because you\u2019re tackling life together.\n\nYou know this because you didn\u2019t say no. \n\nBut your reluctance makes it sound like you don\u2019t actually want to be partners (or don\u2019t want to pay off your debt) and you\u2019ll happily sponge off your richer girlfriend for the rest of your life.

Whats odd is that she would have much more saving to cover the rent now that she down on her luck if she wasn't covering your rent when you were down on your luck. \n\nYou just a selfish asshole, and I hope she'll remember that the next time you're out of a job \n\nYTA", ">she can be emotional sometimes\n\nas can the vast majority of human beings - do you think your response isn't 'emotional'?", "You've just confirmed that your GF is way better off without you.

Instead she sacrificed that extra savings so you could have a roof over your head AND be debt free, which is a pretty freaking lucky position to be in.
