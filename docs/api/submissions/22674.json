She downsized to another house 2 mins away.\n\nI was not supportive of this bc of MIL, and I warned my parents. She first used her leverage to meet my family (bf and I had purposely never introduced  them as we aren\u2019t getting married and bc of MIL). I can take all the self-satisfied comments she makes about the sale - to be clear, there was NO discount and in fact did her a favour as it was a quick and easy sale - but she\u2019s trying to invite herself when we visit. She first rushes to her new house when she learns we\u2019re there through neighbours then basically acts as if she\u2019s a member of my family: sits with us at the beach; leaves at the same time; tries to supervise when my bf and I are watching my nephew; lingers until she gets an invite to dinner etc. This isn\u2019t welcome by anyone esp since we\u2019re all pretty introverted and my parents don\u2019t speak English well. She\u2019s intense and while not a bad person, has obvious narcissistic habits. My bf has softly tried to manage this by spending 1:1 time with her, and goalkeeping but she doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nShe directly asked me when we\u2019d all like to come to her place for dinner. I had been giving non-answers before, but I told her that we\u2019re not going to come. Then I told her that this is our vacation and my family just want to spend time together. \n\nSo I felt like crap bc she had crying eyes. My bf had to hear it from her. She was both angry and sad. She called me ungrateful, couldn\u2019t understand that she\u2019s not \u201cmy family\u201d.\n\nI know I don\u2019t have to spend time with anyone I don\u2019t want, but AITA? I feel pretty guilty.\nShould I be more grateful?
