You **massively** overreacted based on a flirty statement from a girl that in no way disrespected neither you, nor your race. You just assumed she was up to no good and because you admit you already had no interest in her, you decided to blow up like a ticking time bomb.\n\nThis is a dick move. If you're uncomfortable with this topic or just easily irritable on it, then just tell her that: \"Hey, I feel uncomfortable with this race talk because I've had bad experience in the past, would you mind if we don't talk about it?\" There, now you've openly shared your feelings on the matter and you can actually see if she really is only interested in you because of your race or she was just making small talk.\n\nBut \"I've never been with an Indian guy before\" is NOT an insult about your race. I would have understood if she told you \"I've never been with a brown guy before\". Or if she told you the same thing but had a look of disgust on her face. Then - yes, by any means, burn her ass and leave this conversation. But from where I'm standing - and as you confirmed above - there was nothing she did or said additionally that implied that she was viewing you as a lesser person based on your race (which is the definition of racism).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's like if a girl walks to me and tells me \"I've never been with a Slavic man before\". Should I be offended by that? Is that offensive - to tell me I'm a Slav? Is this an insult? Simply stating your race sure doesn't feel insulting to me.\n\nI'll give you another example and take away the race completely, so hopefully I can get my point across better: imagine you walk to a girl, you start chatting and you say \"I've never been with a girl with blue eyes before\", to which she replies \"Well yeah, we're way out of your league\", then turns around and leaves. Do you think she would have been rude? Because if so, this is the exact same situation as above, since - as I explained above - simply stating somebody's race really isn't an insult, unless there is something more to imply it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yes, you're TA in this situation. You're not TA for defending against racist remarks - you should never tolerate those and I would 100% be with you on that one. But this wasn't a racist remark, it was some flirty small talk from a girl you just met and you absolutely overreacted and blew up at her.\n\nIf you ever see her again, be the bigger man - apologize for the way you reacted, explain to her that you felt offended by her remark and felt like she was being racist and that's why you said what you said. If she really didn't mean it in this way, she'll forgive you and everything is fine. You don't need to be interested in her to communicate with her in a civil way.\n\n(And if she in fact turns out to be a racist and starts verbally attacking you... well, we've already seen you're quick with words, so I'm sure you'll figure out something good to say to shut her up again.)", "She never reduced him to his race, she was making small talk while flirting. Read below in my other comment, where I explain it better but simply stating \"I've never been with an Indian guy before\" is NOT racist, unless there is anything more to imply it.\n\nIf you have this sentence: \"An Indian guy walks down the street.\" - do you think the narrator telling it is racist?", "Were you wearing a bangle, or a red bracelet?

Read below in my other comment, where I explain it better but simply stating \"I've never been with an Indian guy before\" is NOT racist, unless there is anything more to imply it.\n\n\"I've never been with an Indian guy\" is bringing his race front and center and acting like it is a relevant component of sleeping with someone. It's objectifying. I already said this once so it's kinda clear you're not engaging with what's being said to you, but whatever.\n\n> If you have this sentence: \"An Indian guy walks down the street.\" - do you think the narrator telling it is racist?\n\nDepends on the reason his race is a factor that merits discussion. Most jokes I've heard that start with \"An Indian guy walks down the street\" end with a racist-ass punchline about curry. But no, in and of itself, since that's not sexually objectifying that man based on his race but merely pointing out his race, in itself not racist. Depends where the story is going and why his race is relevant.", "Yeah you got it, it's a rakhi. That a good line. I actually didn't mind her roast, it's been several months and my rakhi is falling apart, my Indian friends have given me a little bit of shit for not cutting it off already", "I'm sorry but\n\n>\"Ah that's interesting.

I can't really think of any other context where you would offer this information unless you're flirting with somebody.\n\nBut again - we never really got to know what the real reason is because OP decided to blow up in this girl's face and leave.", ">Depends where the story is going and why his race is relevant.\n\nExactly, and we didn't even get to know why she said it because OP cut her off completely, despite there being nothing she said or did that implied she was belittling him based on his race.", "What do I know?

Because she didn't say \"I noticed you are Indian.\" she said \"I've never been with an Indian guy before.\" That is a different statement, it is explicitly an objectifying sexual statement about not having had sex with a member of his race yet. If he said \"I'm from India\" and she said \"Oh that's cool\" and asked a question about his culture, or talked about a trip to India she'd made it'd be a different story. But no, she immediately sexually objectified him based on his race. That is racist.", ">He may have been over the top with his comment.\n\nNo question about that.\n\nI would understood if he got offended by the sexual nature of her comment but from his posts he clearly states that it was the racism which he had a problem with and - as I explained above - I don't think the girl was being racist here. It would have been a different story, if she was.", "OP wasn't triggered by her sexual remark but the fact that she called him an Indian.

Telling her how racist she was, would have been more honest.", "Brilliant response, OP! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "NTA, public humiliation is a great response to racism, if your \u201cgood friend\u201d Alexis doesn\u2019t get it, she\u2019s not even a friend, let alone a good friend.", "Naw she had it coming. Great response.  As an Indian girl who grew up here in the US it's creepy when a dude does this. It makes no difference that you're a dude. NTA!", "NTA. You just gave as good as you got.", "NTA. She insulted you.", "You could have been more kind, and not insulted her looks - I mean, if you thought she was hot, would you have had an issue with what she said? Maybe so, I don\u2019t know.", "Just because she was an asshole doesn\u2019t mean you need to be one, and also being an asshole has now made things socially awkward for you.", "NTA- tell her \"your friend didn't have to be a dick by being racist either\".", "I regret I have but one upvote to give.", "Reddit done right. I have no awards to give, so please accept my sincere appreciation as your prize.", "That\u2019s why I think it was genius.", "She is (presumably, from her reported comments) a sexually active adult woman. Saying she doesn't know how to handle her own attraction to someone is infantilising someone using race as a pickup line. She knew exactly what she was doing.", "[removed]", "OP shall have my vote!", "I respond by saying I come with my own dipping sauce. And they normally don't get what that means.", "It\u2019s microagression. Your rejection may seem to be a harsh response to her comments. (\u201cA bit racist but not THAT bad, he should have just explained\u201cetc\u201d.) Sure but when it\u2019s the 20th time you hear it it\u2019s not such an innocent comment anymore as you explain very well in another comment.\n\nI got a taste of this while hanging out with a friend who is of Asian origin in a majority white country. Born and raised native but everywhere we went people would ask him if he spoke the language or just assume he didn\u2019t and start talking to him in English. I was a bystander and I was getting angry at this constant jab. He ended up snapping at someone and I wasn\u2019t surprised at all. Others were shocked that he was being so rude to someone just for asking an \u201cinnocent\u201d question.", "Bot. Comment irrelevant to previous comment.", "It's not OP we're talking about, we're talking about pocketdisco's comment.", "I don't get it either lol", "Please share with the class, we like zingers too", "Ahahahhahahaaa", "Yeah dude, it's May! You'll be getting another one in like three months!\n\nTurns out the dude did have four sisters and they'd tied all four strands together to make one bracelet.", "Rakhi is aug 30 my dude. It\u2019s not been a few months you\u2019re rocking last years rakhi lmao. That\u2019s some dedication, lucky sisters :)", "And there it is! The go-to of anyone like you when someone questions their racism-blind worldview. \"It's not possible that I don't care enough to recognize and understand racism, it's that the racism you're describing isn't actually real and you're just too sensitive.\"\n\nPoints for being predictable, I guess.", "NTA as an Asian girl same. People who act like being not white is soooo exotic are creepy.", "Just a note.. I can\u2019t tell you how many Indian men done married have said I\u2019ve never been with a whote woman before.. I really want to be with a white woman. It\u2019s creepy and stupid as F \u2026 but happens to everyone in most races. Not saying she want racist also\u2026 but I\u2019ve had men constantly tell me what they were in to\u2026 never had.. Hispanic women, Asian women.. men do this shit ALL the time.", "i get how obnoxious and ignorant she was being, but she was at least *trying* to be positive towards you, and you needlessly insulted her appearance and essentially by \"league\" also her overall worth. \n\nyou could have told her you were bothered by how tone deaf she was, but instead you chose to ruthlessly tear her down. yeah YTA.", "as an indian girl sick of hearing this, NTA lmao", "\"I'm out of your league\"? that's a great burn in the context, but it's not really \"being a Dick\". It's very low on the insult scale. NTA", "NTA and agree with everyone here. I\u2019d also maybe rethink my friendship with Alexis if she can\u2019t see the racism in the other friend\u2019s comment and sees you as the one in the wrong", "Maybe. I thought it was a pretty funny retort, but I can see why *she* wouldn't."]}
