I've found that at best, they're a little bit stupid for bringing up race for no reason and thinking it would be a good way to flirt. At worst, they see Indian men as lesser and thinks I should consider myself lucky that she's showing interest.\n\nSo when she said that I was pretty done with the conversation.

I\u2019m a old white lady and even I know that shit isn\u2019t ok)", "Right yes, fuck her, but definitely don't *fuck* her.", "Is that because you consider calling somebody Indian an insult?", "Alright, so realistically she didn't really say or do anything to imply that the statement was an insult, yet you assumed it is, got offended by it and blasted the girl?\n\nOP, I'm gonna tell you something that the rest of this thread is not going to tell you, because they are too busy getting triggered and validating you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA. 100%. You **massively** overreacted based on a flirty statement from a girl that in no way disrespected neither you, nor your race. You just assumed she was up to no good and because you admit you already had no interest in her, you decided to blow up like a ticking time bomb.\n\nThis is a dick move. If you're uncomfortable with this topic or just easily irritable on it, then just tell her that: \"Hey, I feel uncomfortable with this race talk because I've had bad experience in the past, would you mind if we don't talk about it?\" There, now you've openly shared your feelings on the matter and you can actually see if she really is only interested in you because of your race or she was just making small talk.\n\nBut \"I've never been with an Indian guy before\" is NOT an insult about your race. I would have understood if she told you \"I've never been with a brown guy before\". Or if she told you the same thing but had a look of disgust on her face. Then - yes, by any means, burn her ass and leave this conversation. But from where I'm standing - and as you confirmed above - there was nothing she did or said additionally that implied that she was viewing you as a lesser person based on your race (which is the definition of racism).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's like if a girl walks to me and tells me \"I've never been with a Slavic man before\". Should I be offended by that? Is that offensive - to tell me I'm a Slav? Is this an insult? Simply stating your race sure doesn't feel insulting to me.\n\nI'll give you another example and take away the race completely, so hopefully I can get my point across better: imagine you walk to a girl, you start chatting and you say \"I've never been with a girl with blue eyes before\", to which she replies \"Well yeah, we're way out of your league\", then turns around and leaves. Do you think she would have been rude? Because if so, this is the exact same situation as above, since - as I explained above - simply stating somebody's race really isn't an insult, unless there is something more to imply it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yes, you're TA in this situation. You're not TA for defending against racist remarks - you should never tolerate those and I would 100% be with you on that one. But this wasn't a racist remark, it was some flirty small talk from a girl you just met and you absolutely overreacted and blew up at her.\n\nIf you ever see her again, be the bigger man - apologize for the way you reacted, explain to her that you felt offended by her remark and felt like she was being racist and that's why you said what you said. If she really didn't mean it in this way, she'll forgive you and everything is fine. You don't need to be interested in her to communicate with her in a civil way.\n\n(And if she in fact turns out to be a racist and starts verbally attacking you... well, we've already seen you're quick with words, so I'm sure you'll figure out something good to say to shut her up again.)", "She never reduced him to his race, she was making small talk while flirting. Read below in my other comment, where I explain it better but simply stating \"I've never been with an Indian guy before\" is NOT racist, unless there is anything more to imply it.\n\nIf you have this sentence: \"An Indian guy walks down the street.\" - do you think the narrator telling it is racist?", "Were you wearing a bangle, or a red bracelet? I once picked up a guy by noticing he had this really elaborate 4 stranded red bracelet on and I asked him, \"Four sisters, or one overachiever?\" It made him laugh.", "NTA. She\u2019s playing race bingo. \n\nNot your fault she can\u2019t get 5 in a row.", "He didn't \"blow up\" at her. He just rejected her.

Read below in my other comment, where I explain it better but simply stating \"I've never been with an Indian guy before\" is NOT racist, unless there is anything more to imply it.\n\n\"I've never been with an Indian guy\" is bringing his race front and center and acting like it is a relevant component of sleeping with someone. It's objectifying. I already said this once so it's kinda clear you're not engaging with what's being said to you, but whatever.\n\n> If you have this sentence: \"An Indian guy walks down the street.\" - do you think the narrator telling it is racist?\n\nDepends on the reason his race is a factor that merits discussion. Most jokes I've heard that start with \"An Indian guy walks down the street\" end with a racist-ass punchline about curry. But no, in and of itself, since that's not sexually objectifying that man based on his race but merely pointing out his race, in itself not racist. Depends where the story is going and why his race is relevant.", "Yeah you got it, it's a rakhi. That a good line. I actually didn't mind her roast, it's been several months and my rakhi is falling apart, my Indian friends have given me a little bit of shit for not cutting it off already", "I'm sorry but\n\n>\"Ah that's interesting. Maybe if you meet an Indian guy who's in your league you'll get your chance.\"\n\nis NOT a simple rejection, that's full on blow up. And the fact that his other friend texted him the same tells me I'm not the only one thinking that:\n\n>Alexis texted me the next morning calling me an asshole and saying I didn't have to reject her by being a dick\n\nIt's not that much to ask to simply say \"Hey, I'm sorry, I'm really not interested in you\" and walk away instead of directly attacking her on assumptions that she was being a racist.", "I would assume it is? I can't really think of any other context where you would offer this information unless you're flirting with somebody.\n\nBut again - we never really got to know what the real reason is because OP decided to blow up in this girl's face and leave.", ">Depends where the story is going and why his race is relevant.\n\nExactly, and we didn't even get to know why she said it because OP cut her off completely, despite there being nothing she said or did that implied she was belittling him based on his race.", "What do I know? It almost sounds like \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of dicks but not an Indian dick\u201d it\u2019s just weird. \n\nHe may have been over the top with his comment.", "No we do know. Because she didn't say \"I noticed you are Indian.\" she said \"I've never been with an Indian guy before.\" That is a different statement, it is explicitly an objectifying sexual statement about not having had sex with a member of his race yet. If he said \"I'm from India\" and she said \"Oh that's cool\" and asked a question about his culture, or talked about a trip to India she'd made it'd be a different story. But no, she immediately sexually objectified him based on his race. That is racist.", ">He may have been over the top with his comment.\n\nNo question about that.\n\nI would understood if he got offended by the sexual nature of her comment but from his posts he clearly states that it was the racism which he had a problem with and - as I explained above - I don't think the girl was being racist here. It would have been a different story, if she was.", "OP wasn't triggered by her sexual remark but the fact that she called him an Indian. Was she only interested sexually in him because he was Indian? Who knows, we'll never truly know, because OP didn't even let her finish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut we're running in circles here, my dude, we'll have to agree to disagree - you believe she was racist in her remark, fair enough, in your view OP's actions were justified. I believe she wasn't racist in her comments and in my view OP's actions were an overreaction.", "You are not wrong. I don\u2019t know what his experiences have been like so I can\u2019t judge."]}
