But you've got to deal with family politics. That means being willing to listen and engage and perhaps compromise.", "Nta. And thankyou. It could have been a joke to the youngest, but i think that Marcus was really hurt by it. Or he will he in the future when she continues to repeat things like this. I hope you will stand up for Marcus again when he needs it. The youngest was being racist. Yeah two girls cannot make a baby, so? That just came out of the flow. You handled it well, but, i just hope when your daughter calms down you can tell her about what the kids were talking about.", "So it\u2019s okay for her kid to mock her son because of his race, but it isn\u2019t okay to tell them that two women can\u2019t create a baby?

A scolding about saying hurtful things and a time out would have been sufficent. The comment about 2 girls not being able to make a baby was inappropriate, not something to say to a 6 year old. You should have told her mothers about teir daughters comment and let them deal with the explanations. They probably had their own plan to explain these things when they could understand it better. But i agree she should have been disciplined but overall it's your daughters call.

It's probably a fake.", "Info: did she understand what Chelsea was saying to Marcus, or had she only heard one side of the story?", "Your daughter is already failing her children if her 6 year old gets to bully her brother about his race.

My niece is 2, my sister & her husband have already done time-out a few times (toddlers are indeed hell-raisers). 6 is old enough to be taught about racism & choosing words carefully; & definitely old enough to be held accountable for her words & actions. Your daughter & her wife are failers for not teaching any of their kids to be decent people or to punish them when they misbehave. Also, with them in your care in your home, you're justified in punishing your grandkids.", "NTA, if the little girl doesn't learn it now, she will become a racist in the future. You did the right thing. Besides, she's gonna get fun of for having two moms, being adopted, a mixed brother, etc. She should know these things, be prepared, and know its ok to have two moms, be adopted, etc. You did handle it well. Your daughter and her spouse are doing a terrible job however.", "NTA, you sound like you handled that well. They should be teaching their children about why they are different and how they are family. Obviously with love and understanding. One child should never feel like the odd one out esp if it is because they are being bullied by their own sister.", "NTA but I like how they think withholding you from them is best because you are helping them when their schedules clash. I bet they not even paying you either. So what are they gonna do if you \u2018don\u2019t\u2019 handle things \u2018properly.\u2019 Btw I think you handled it great", "this is why people stand against people like your daughter adopting Black kids/kids of color.. you\u2019re the only good adult here NTA", "Nta\nThe moment a child starts having negative views regarding race is when the teaching begins. Nip that shit in the bud.\n\nNta", "A close friend of mine has two adopted kids, and one of them is mixed race. She explained to me about conspicuous versus inconspicuous adoptions, and the different struggles they present. My understanding is that, technically, Marcus is *not* a conspicuous adoption, because a mixed race baby can be born of a white mommy. None of the kiddos are \"conspicuous,\" because theoretically any of them could have been born of either mommy, through use of a donor or whathaveyou. \n\nI suppose it depends on the six year old, but I feel like most would be able to understand that actually Marcus looking different does *not* mean he could not have been born of one of their mommies, because children from the same mommy can look different from one another, but these particular children were adopted, which means none of them were born of their mommies but were each chosen to build their family. Of course, these really are discussions their mothers should be having with them, but if they're avoiding those topics for some reason and you see Marcus being bullied then of course you have to step in.\n\nI'd be interested to know what your daughter expected you to say or do in the circumstance. Does she intend to ignore the bullying rather than confront the fact that her children are adopted? There is certainly no shame in it, and I very much hope she isn't conveying to her kids that there is.\n\nNTA", "NTA, what the girl said was not right & is not acceptable to say at any age. She is not too young to understand that no one is any different from anyone else on the inside & what you look like doesn't matter, in fact the younger the better. I think you handled it well & pointing out that none of them are from their mummies tummies was fine to do too, she needs to understand that in that respect all 3 of the kids are exactly the same. I assume they all know they are adopted, so really she was mocking him for the colour of his skin which is not acceptable at any age.", "NTA\n\nYou made the best choice you could in the moment.  It turns out that your daughter disagreed with it, but many folks would have no problem with putting a kid in timeout for somthing like that. \n\nNow you have more choices to make.  You can either: a) call your daughter every time you have a question about how to handle a situation with these kids or b) choose not to babysit the kids again until she stops berating you for doing your best.", "NTA disciple means to teach. You were teaching love and acceptance for everyone and explaining that to her", "NTA.  She's six and is young enough to be disciplined.  She is also old enough to understand the whole situation and her mommies failed her.  You handled it well and if Sandra and her wife don't nip this behavior in the bud, they're going to find their hands full with a racist little girl.", "Number one, saying that you have to handle things properly from two women is a joke\nNumber two, you did a great job", "You're nta.  Like where is a young child picking up racist remarks like that to say to their new sibling.  You were absolutely in the right for correcting that immediately.", "So the child comprehends enough to be racist, but not enough to understand that treating someone differently because their skin colour is wrong?", "NTA. Do they know Marcus is being teased? Because that should be their main focus.", "Nice of then to threaten you with not seeing the kids.\n\nNTA but I wouldn't provide emergency child care anymore", "Slight YTA. Not because you disciplined Chelsea, but because you said that two girls can\u2019t make a baby. Maybe they couldn\u2019t all by themselves, but with donor sperm, tons of same sex couples are able to have babies \u201cfrom their tummy\u201d. I think you should have left it as none of them DID come from their mommies\u2019 tummies, not that none of them could have.", "NTA", "NTA\n- for explaining to a 6yr old that name calling, teasing, bullying, etc are inappropriate behaviors.\n\nMaybe TA \n- for saying anything about 2 Mommies and how human reproduction works. That responsibly belongs only with the parents or others that they specifically designate. Parents and caregivers need to be on the same page.", "NTA, if your daughter or her wife didn\u2019t like the way you handled the discipline and explanation, all they can do is give you strategies that align more with their parenting values, and move on. Now they know that they weren\u2019t comfortable with how you handled that, they can come up with a plan on how they can make sure their kids are disciplined in a way they find appropriate for the age and action when they\u2019re not there, if that\u2019s something that all three of you (daughter, DIL, and yourself) can agree to work on. \n6yo sounds like they\u2019re repeating something they\u2019ve heard from someone else, like you said. They probably didn\u2019t understand the true meaning of their words, it sounds like a \u201cI want to say something mean and I know that this thing I\u2019ve heard other people say is mean, but I don\u2019t quite know why, but I know it\u2019ll hurt his feelings\u201d situation\u2026if that makes sense? I just can\u2019t imagine responding the way your daughter and her wife did when it involves something as serious and racism. I get that the kid is 6 but there needs to be a serious conversation to explain, where the kids can ask questions, and they can all work on strategies of what to do if someone is bullying or being racist to their sibling.", "NTA. My cousin who's like 8 knows about the whole LGBTQ+ Community because of her parents, she's know since she was little. She was raised in that format and that's perfectly okay. Adoption is perfectly okay. There's even children's books to help explain to kids how some of it works, do people appreciate them? No. Are they helpful? Very much so. I'm just glad that there's moms and Grandmothers like you that are so accepting and adaptable to changes like these (even though everyone knows it's been going on since the 70s and no one likes to admit it)", "NTA for so many reasons but especially because your daughter expects you to babysit but did not tell you how she wanted situations like this one handled. If she did not tell you, you handle it to the best of your ability, which you did. Your daughter is a bit of a jerk about this! What she might have said was \"In the future, please handle it this way.\" not threaten you to not see the children. That is a jerky move in this situation - what is she going to do if you say \"Okay. Stop bring them on weekends when there is a schedule clash.\"?", "NTA. But maybe just address bullying and racism, not reproduction issues. My guess is that's why they are upset.\n\nI'm not a parent, but I don't tolerate bullying or racism in my life anymore. I'm pretty sure I'd be correcting little ones before they can even understand why. All they need to know is it unacceptable. \n\nOP should maybe try and talk to her daughter about all the topics, and find out where their intolerance is coming from.", "NTA.", "NTA you handled it very well. Do the girls not know they are adopted? Seems weird they are taking about coming out of their moms tummy. If they haven't discussed them being adopted or willing to have proper talks about different races, relationships, age appropriate how babies are made etc. They are failing those kids.", "Six is absolutely not too young to be taught about racism or biology, in an age appropriate way. Not being racist or a bully should be a lesson from when they start waking and taking.", "\u2026 and for thinking a 6 y/o can\u2019t learn that you shouldn\u2019t bully someone because of their skin colour.

Bcuz is easier and a lot of \"older\" people use shorthand.

You guys are forgetting that these people were in their 30s and 40s when they had cell phones for the first time. My mother had a Razr (flip phone) at 41-", "I just took it to mean OP was white British, tbh. Typed out like British slang/speak.", "Well moms \"let's not try and correct her because she is too young\" approach is how you end up with one more racist person. The situation is alarming enough that words such as racism/racist should be part of the discussion.", "Well apparently she didn't say this out of not understanding how he could be their child too, but from a bullying standpoint and thinking that if she came from her Mom's belly than she isnsupposed to be something better.", "You're right. It is ageism. I just think that the shorthand used varies because of life experiences.\nBeing charged 20p for 160 characters on an SMS made shorthand very short \n\nI've seen people my age use cos, but not Bcuz, so I could see where the suggestion came from.", "I'm white and British, I'm also in my 40s. I don't think people my age or older would use Bcuz.\nWe were around when texts were expensive and every character was sacred.
