If the six year old noticed the difference, she is old enough for a talk. Ask your daughter how would she like such matters handled.", "NTA- and both mommies are failing miserably already if they're not so open that the kids aren't already aware that none of them came from mommies tummy.", "NTA, this is something those children will have to deal with going forward, not only being adopted and mixed race but also having lesbian parents, so sooner they learn about this the better, I'm sure you put it in a better way than their kindergarten bully or their bigot parent would.", "NTA, I don't think you did anything wrong and I do think you handled it well. But you've got to deal with family politics. That means being willing to listen and engage and perhaps compromise.", "Nta. And thankyou. It could have been a joke to the youngest, but i think that Marcus was really hurt by it. Or he will he in the future when she continues to repeat things like this. I hope you will stand up for Marcus again when he needs it. The youngest was being racist. Yeah two girls cannot make a baby, so? That just came out of the flow. You handled it well, but, i just hope when your daughter calms down you can tell her about what the kids were talking about.", "So it\u2019s okay for her kid to mock her son because of his race, but it isn\u2019t okay to tell them that two women can\u2019t create a baby?

Damn.\nNTA", "NTA", "If y'all think a 56 year old says things like   \n\n\n>how he was weird bcuz he didn\u2019t look like them or their mommies\n\nI want to know what people you're hanging out with.   \nThere's no way this is for real.", "YTA, you were right to step in and say something. A scolding about saying hurtful things and a time out would have been sufficent. The comment about 2 girls not being able to make a baby was inappropriate, not something to say to a 6 year old. You should have told her mothers about teir daughters comment and let them deal with the explanations. They probably had their own plan to explain these things when they could understand it better. But i agree she should have been disciplined but overall it's your daughters call. Maybe sit down with them and discuss what was said and what their expectations are if something similar happens in the future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
