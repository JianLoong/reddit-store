Sorry, but why should *you* be the one that has to learn Spanish?  I'm assuming you live in an English-speaking country, so if anyone should learn a new language, it's them.  Assuming the first language of your country isn't Spanish, the sheer audacity of moving to a country where your language isn't the primary language and then demanding other people learn to speak *your* language is insensitive at best and brain-dead the rest of the time.  When I moved to Germany I didn't demand everyone speak my language.
