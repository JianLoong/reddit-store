You don't speak Spanish; what more can you say about it? Would it be a respectful and enriching thing for you to learn the language? Yes, of course. But getting pissed because you're Hispanic and don't speak Spanish is kinda ridiculous on their part.", "You\u2019re not the ahole. Shame on her. It isn\u2019t disrespect to tell someone you can\u2019t understand. And you are not filthy.\n\nDoesn\u2019t look like she is making much of an effort to learn English so why should you have to learn Spanish? Just sayin\u2026", "NTA...she called you a liar and a filthy woman. Your response was justified. I wouldn\u2019t plan on going back to their house again anytime soon.", "Your bf should have had your back and stopped them from yelling at you or just left with you when they became abusive.  You shouldn't have cursed at them because your bf should have handed the situation without it escalating that far.\n\nYou're **NTA**, and you're the only one in this situation who isn't.", "NTA. Um, because you look a certain way you should know a certain language? nope. That may have been accurate 100 years ago, but not now.", "NTA.  Sorry, but why should *you* be the one that has to learn Spanish?  I'm assuming you live in an English-speaking country, so if anyone should learn a new language, it's them.  Assuming the first language of your country isn't Spanish, the sheer audacity of moving to a country where your language isn't the primary language and then demanding other people learn to speak *your* language is insensitive at best and brain-dead the rest of the time.  When I moved to Germany I didn't demand everyone speak my language.  I look Lebanese even though I'm not, and when people speak Arabic to me (I live in Canada now, high population of Arabic-speaking immigrants) I just say I don't speak Arabic and they don't yell at me.", "I think you need a new boyfriend", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend should have nipped this in the bid immediately. The fact he\u2019s still wavering? Not good. Not good at all.", "NTA. Perhaps she was taking your micro gestures and responses from being familiar with some of what you were saying as an indication of some level of fluency. It was wrong to get so aggressive about it. She had no reason to be angry that you were trying to respond in the way that best suited you. Elders can be a little nuts too. GL!", "NTA. They think you should respect THEIR culture by trying to learn Spanish when they moved to a predominately English speaking nation and aren't trying to learn English? That's just asinine.", "NTA. Your boyfriend didn\u2019t introduce you properly- he could have easily explained that you are not fluent in Spanish- before you met them in person. He also didn\u2019t try to stop the crazy his grandma threw at you. You responded accordingly given the level animosity and insults.", "Obviously YTA -- because people who look a certain way HAVE to be able to speak a certain language, DUH!\n\nI am being sarcastic. I hope your BF sees how racist his grandmother was being. NTA at all.", "Nta. You need a new bf.", "Why dont they learn english and respect your culture then? Lol NTA", "I don't think the truth is inappropriate or rude. NTA. My SIL was born in South America and she does not speak Spanish. No biggie. Just her reality. I can see trying to learn. But, that's what you do for yourself - not because someone else demands it of you so you meet their expectations.", "It\u2019s so weird to me that your bf translated that instead of replying back and calming the situation. He should\u2019ve left with you when she called you that without needing you to understand what she said in front of them. I think you should talk to him about it or else, it is a glimpse of your future with him.\n\nNTA, but I do think you should\u2019ve been calmer (understandable if you\u2019re younger that 17). You have to know that old people do things like that all the time. With time and experience, you\u2019ll learn to react to disrespect in a way that it doesn\u2019t affect you, but allows you to create boundaries so they don\u2019t say things like that again.", "Call Border Patrol every time they give you crap.", "ESH - They shouldn't have yelled at you and you shouldn't have yelled at them.", "I mean u don't speak Spanish then well I guess the hag gotta deal with it", "There is great power and wisdom in the power of the fart!", "ESH kinda, but she definitely started it so she sucks more, unless she's experiencing some sort of cognitive decline that would cause her to be paranoid. Regardless of her reasoning, you shouldn't have yelled back but it sounds like you already know that.", "Yta. That last part, another your bf is right. Relatives over reacted and you did too by cursing at them.\n\nIt wouldn't hurt to learn the language of half your heritage, especially if you have relationships with Spanish speaking families.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
