{"id": 2828, "submission_id": "z0ea7o", "title": "AITA for refusing to pay for my brother\u2019s fishing supplies that I broke?", "selftext": "My \\[22F\\] grandparents died when I was young, and my mom inherited the house. She never sold it, and likes to use it for holiday celebrations. My brother \\[24M\\], Sam, and I have full access to the house. Sam uses it often and doesn\u2019t treat it well. This upsets mom because she wants it to be clean for the holidays, yet she doesn\u2019t take away his keys, and she always expects me to help her clean the mess because she knows Sam won\u2019t. \n\nSo, I came to town with my new kitten yesterday, and was planning to stay at my grandparent\u2019s house. I was told that there may be some fishing gear out, but overall, it\u2019s clean. I walked into the house, and it was so bad that the only safe place for me to leave the cat unattended was a bathroom. It was disgusting. There was rotting meat, maggots, mold, mud, open beer cans everywhere, fishing hooks on the carpet, plus a pile of like 20 fishing rods thrown on the floor. There was more, but it's hard to describe how bad it was with just words alone.\n\nI called my mom crying, because I had nowhere else to stay since they had guests staying in my bedroom. My options were to figure something out there or drive hours back to my apartment. My mom told me to just clean it up enough so that it would be safe for my cat to be there, and to just throw any of Sam's stuff into the garage. She said that we were going to have to clean it up anyways so might as well just start now. So, I did, even though I was upset with the fact that I was once again expected to clean up Sam's mess for him. While cleaning, I put his pile of fishing rods into the garage like my mom said.\n\nEarlier today he came over here to get something for his next fishing trip, and I guess 2 of his rods that I moved broke. I don\u2019t know how because he wouldn\u2019t show me, but he started demanding that I pay him $150 for replacements because I was the one that moved them. I refused and told him he has no business treating the house the way he does. I essentially said that I\u2019m sorry his rods broke and I didn't mean to damage anything but if he wouldn\u2019t have left them out like he did this wouldn\u2019t be an issue. I showed him pictures of the rat shit, mold, and maggots that I had to clean up just so my cat wouldn\u2019t eat it and get sick. He had lied and said that the house was pretty much clean, and since he didn\u2019t clean it up himself then this is what he gets. Now he refuses to speak to me until I pay him, and calls me an asshole for refusing to. \n\nMy mom is trying to stay out of it but suggested I just pay him so we can have a peaceful Thanksgiving. My dad is on my side. My brother\u2019s girlfriend texted me basically saying that I\u2019m an asshole because it\u2019s easier for me to afford $150 than it is for him. In response I sent her photos of everything I had to clean up, and she left me on read. At first I was sure of my stance but now I\u2019m not sure and was hoping to get some outside input.

My mom makes a lot of excuses for him and it's sad - both for messes like this along with many other things. She says that even though he makes this huge mess, he helps her in other areas that makes up for it. She also blames it on his ADHD - which I get that ADHD can make you very messy and all.

I do think that he has some problems, and I think he sees it too, but he doesn't want to seek help. But I will say that this sort of behavior has been a pattern since we were young, and since he has been enabled for so long I think that plays a large role in why he leaves messes like this with no intentions to clean. For instance, growing up he would absolutely destroy our shared bathroom but I was the one that would always have to clean it up. My mom would say it was fair because I have a disability that made it so I couldn't help him and my dad shovel snow during the winters, so this is how we make it \"equal\". In high school he almost failed out because he struggled with certain subject and refused to do homework, and as a result my mom made me do his homework and take some online classes for him so he would graduate. He also was at fault for 3 car accidents before my parents stopped buying him replacement cars and paying for his insurance. I moved out for university and my brother continues to live at home and attend trade school, and I know for a fact that my parents are always cleaning up after him.

He should have been told to get his butt down to that house and clean his own damn mess. His sister should not have to do it for him.", "That's kind of what I'm planning on doing going forward honestly. Every year when I come home for holiday breaks she expects me to help her clean up this mess that my brother made (although this is the worst it's ever been), and I always feel bad saying no, and sometimes am afraid to say no because my relationship with my mom can sometimes be extremely transactional. I'm still partially financially dependent on my parents, and if I don't help her with things like this she gets very upset, holds it over my head, and sometimes threatens to take the help away. I'm about to graduate though and I have a job lined up for after school, and I won't need my parents help anymore.

Sounds like your dad is seeing the light, at least, so he should be requiring your brother to help your mother clean it up, since neither of them sees anything wrong with his behavior.\n\nYour brother's girlfriend had no right to butt into this situation. She's probably ignoring you because your pictures told a story that is completely different from the one he told her. She's got egg on her face and us too proud to apologize.\n\nHold your ground, but be prepared for a tense Thanksgiving dinner.", "NTA\n\nHe's lying about the fishing poles and he owes you for having to clean up his cesspool of a mess. Why doesn't your mom take his keys dang that's just nasty.", "NTA", "NTA. Don\u2019t give your brother a dime and tell your mom that she can allow him to trash the house if she wants to, but you will never clean it again. Why are you cleaning up after a 24 year old man? Refuse to attend any holiday get-togethers that consist of you cleaning up maggots for your entitled brother.", "Don\u2019t you dare pay him! \n\nI\u2019m glad you took pictures of the filth you had to clean up because I guarantee everyone would have minimized if you hadn\u2019t. Actually, it\u2019s telling that they\u2019re STILL trying to get you to pretend you\u2019re in the wrong when faced with photographic evidence. Here\u2019s the thing: You\u2019ve been cleaning up your brother\u2019s messes for year. Your family is blaming you not because you\u2019re at fault but because for the first time you\u2019re rejecting your role as the per who fixes your brother\u2019s mistakes. This is especially uncomfortable for your mom who will have to face his bad behavior. \n\nDo NOT pay him a cent. And for the love of god stop cleaning his filth \u2014 even if it means you don\u2019t use the cabin for the next year. Make a decision that you\u2019re no longer your brother\u2019s maid and trash bin. NTA", "Your mom CAN\u2019T stay out of it.", "NTA Your brother acts like an entitled child, and your mother enables him. If he or his girlfriend brings it up again, tell them you\u2019ll happily bill them for your time and effort you had to put into cleaning.", "Can you tell your mom that you are paying to have the locks changed ? You know he made copies of the keys so you can't just take it back", "NTA If he takes care of the fishing rods like he does the house, he is probably the one that broke them, and is blaming you so he can con you into giving him money.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nI'm a fisherman. Fishing rods don't break simply by being moved from one place to another. Unless you were tossing them across the room or into the garage, I'd venture a guess that this is not your damage.", "NTA your mom is making you the scapegoat for cleaning up his messes. Ask her to take back his key or the next time you will leave his messes as is and she can deal with him and the clean up. As long as you keep cleaning up you are enabling the behavior. It is wrong for your mom to ask you to keep the peace, when he is the one causing turmoil without consequences.", "NTa.\n\nAlso calling bullshit that moving a rod can break it considering it's built to handle a fish dragging on it. These things are meant to be flexible and hard to break. Have you seen how much they can bend and how much weight can go on them?\n\nEither he broke it himself, or he is lying and wants a payout. Say you'll do a repair or if it can't be fixed a direct replacement with a new one, you a friend who works at a fish and tackle store. Send photos and give the brand and model.\n\nThen call bullshit. Because it's most likely bullshit.", "Yta you throw something that is not your property and you don't know the value of the things you throw. You should ask first to your brother m", "I don\u2019t believe in the broken fishing rods (I\u2019d want to see the damage). For Christmas, he should get before and after photos. \n\nMom needs to check in on the house and light a fire under his backside from time to time. Putting pressure on the nice kid to pay $$$ because she doesn\u2019t want to read Sam the riot act isn\u2019t good parenting/adulting.", "If OP needs to pay him for his 'broken' rods, he needs to pay her a reasonable fee per hour for cleaning. $50/hr sounds about right.", ">But are they hard to break? \n\nThey're made literally to pull multiple dozens of lbs of struggling fish out of water. \n\nNot only would it be very noticeable if you broke one, you'd have to seriously put some effort into it. \n\nNTA, this is a scam.", "NTA. I promise you that you didn't break anything. Please don't pay him a cent, you have done absolutely nothing wrong.", "I don't know much about fishing rods, but I've moved my husband's (bothe cheap ones and pricier) and they're usually pretty flexible, so moving them shouldn't break them. If he won't show you, he may be lying that they're broken at all. Even if they are, it would be much more likely that he broke them and is trying to blame you since clearly leaving trash around isn't a problem for him or that they were broken from his careless storage methods. Either way, even if you did somehow break them, NTA. If he has no respect for other people's property, he's owed no respect for his.", "That would not have broken them, throwing them, walking on them would break them.", "If your brother is the type of person who would leave a giant disgusting mess for others to clean up, he is also the type of person who would lie about something being broken. You need to stop giving him the benefit of the doubt. NTA", "You mom enables him. \n\nI mean listen to her. You should pay him because he lied and you had to clean up a disgusting map.\n\nYou should pay??????????????????", "I have ADHD, and while I let things like laundry pile up too high and am liable to forget clean dishes in the dishwasher, I have never had an outbreak of mold or maggots.", "Does the girlfriend know about that?", "[removed]", "Yeah I actually don't care if she snapped every single fishing rod clean in half as she moved them. He's repeatedly and continually demonstrated he doesn't give a shit about her time, effort, or sanity - I am not sure why she should give half a shit about his fishing rods he couldn't be bothered to put away.", ">*don't pay him a cent*\n\nInstead, bill him for your cleaning services.", "I'm not 100% sure if his girlfriend knows but I often see her cleaning up after him anyways so I assume so.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
