{"id": 2828, "submission_id": "z0ea7o", "title": "AITA for refusing to pay for my brother\u2019s fishing supplies that I broke?", "selftext": "My \\[22F\\] grandparents died when I was young, and my mom inherited the house. She never sold it, and likes to use it for holiday celebrations. My brother \\[24M\\], Sam, and I have full access to the house. Sam uses it often and doesn\u2019t treat it well. This upsets mom because she wants it to be clean for the holidays, yet she doesn\u2019t take away his keys, and she always expects me to help her clean the mess because she knows Sam won\u2019t.\n\nSo, I came to town with my new kitten yesterday, and was planning to stay at my grandparent\u2019s house. I was told that there may be some fishing gear out, but overall, it\u2019s clean. I walked into the house, and it was so bad that the only safe place for me to leave the cat unattended was a bathroom. It was disgusting. There was rotting meat, maggots, mold, mud, open beer cans everywhere, fishing hooks on the carpet, plus a pile of like 20 fishing rods thrown on the floor. There was more, but it's hard to describe how bad it was with just words alone.\n\nI called my mom crying, because I had nowhere else to stay since they had guests staying in my bedroom. My options were to figure something out there or drive hours back to my apartment. My mom told me to just clean it up enough so that it would be safe for my cat to be there, and to just throw any of Sam's stuff into the garage. She said that we were going to have to clean it up anyways so might as well just start now. So, I did, even though I was upset with the fact that I was once again expected to clean up Sam's mess for him. While cleaning, I put his pile of fishing rods into the garage like my mom said.\n\nEarlier today he came over here to get something for his next fishing trip, and I guess 2 of his rods that I moved broke. I don\u2019t know how because he wouldn\u2019t show me, but he started demanding that I pay him $150 for replacements because I was the one that moved them. I refused and told him he has no business treating the house the way he does. I essentially said that I\u2019m sorry his rods broke and I didn't mean to damage anything but if he wouldn\u2019t have left them out like he did this wouldn\u2019t be an issue. I showed him pictures of the rat shit, mold, and maggots that I had to clean up just so my cat wouldn\u2019t eat it and get sick. He had lied and said that the house was pretty much clean, and since he didn\u2019t clean it up himself then this is what he gets. Now he refuses to speak to me until I pay him, and calls me an asshole for refusing to.\n\nMy mom is trying to stay out of it but suggested I just pay him so we can have a peaceful Thanksgiving. My dad is on my side. My brother\u2019s girlfriend texted me basically saying that I\u2019m an asshole because it\u2019s easier for me to afford $150 than it is for him. In response I sent her photos of everything I had to clean up, and she left me on read. At first I was sure of my stance but now I\u2019m not sure and was hoping to get some outside input. AITA?\n\nUpdate:\n\nThanks for all of the responses. Turns out what really happened was that Sam's girlfriend ended up not seeing the rods where I put them and stepped on them. She didn't tell Sam this until later today after she texted me and I didn't respond how she hoped. Currently Sam and his gf are here but downstairs fighting about who-knows-what. He's apparently going to be helping to clean out the garage, so we'll see how that goes. \n\nLike I mentioned, I cleaned up the house yesterday enough so that my cat wouldn't get into anything that would make her sick or injure her, but there's still a lot of work to do before the house is fit to have company over. So my mom came in earlier, saw the state of the house, and started crying. I didn't mention this in the post but my mom inherited the house jointly with my aunt who lives on the other side of the state. My aunt will flip out if she sees what Sam did to it, which adds an extra layer of pressure on my mom to get it clean. The only thing my mom said when she walked in was that she's stressed about all the stuff she has to do to prepare for Thanksgiving, and then she just stopped speaking altogether. I tried to talk to her but she just ignored me. Now she's just in the kitchen trying to make it look presentable.\n\n Not much else to say, everyone is currently to stressed out with other stuff to speak to me at the moment so I'm just in the corner on my laptop with my cat pretending to do homework. Not sure what's going to happen next but I'll keep y'all updated on if anything else of interest happens.", "created_utc": 1668975956, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0ea7o/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_brothers_fishing/", "score": 568, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do think that he has some problems, and I think he sees it too, but he doesn't want to seek help. But I will say that this sort of behavior has been a pattern since we were young, and since he has been enabled for so long I think that plays a large role in why he leaves messes like this with no intentions to clean. For instance, growing up he would absolutely destroy our shared bathroom but I was the one that would always have to clean it up. My mom would say it was fair because I have a disability that made it so I couldn't help him and my dad shovel snow during the winters, so this is how we make it \"equal\". In high school he almost failed out because he struggled with certain subject and refused to do homework, and as a result my mom made me do his homework and take some online classes for him so he would graduate.

He should have been told to get his butt down to that house and clean his own damn mess. His sister should not have to do it for him.", "That's kind of what I'm planning on doing going forward honestly. Every year when I come home for holiday breaks she expects me to help her clean up this mess that my brother made (although this is the worst it's ever been), and I always feel bad saying no, and sometimes am afraid to say no because my relationship with my mom can sometimes be extremely transactional. I'm still partially financially dependent on my parents, and if I don't help her with things like this she gets very upset, holds it over my head, and sometimes threatens to take the help away. I'm about to graduate though and I have a job lined up for after school, and I won't need my parents help anymore. So my plan is to essentially just come in to visit the night before/day of a holiday so she can't make me clean everything.", "And yet she lets your brother get away with it.
