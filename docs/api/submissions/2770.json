It\u2019s a pretty expensive trip because the ticket cost me usually around $800-$1000, I\u2019m buying gifts for all of my family members, which is about 15 people, and I have to pay for my own stuff while I\u2019m there, things, such as groceries, travel, going out to eat, etc. Overall since I moved away, I\u2019ve spent roughly $3000 each time I go back. Sure I could just skip out on getting everybody gifts and hoping me being there to celebrate and spend quality time is enough but unfortunately my presence is not enough for them. They want gifts too. Not only that I stay with my parents and my two siblings that still live at home. So for the duration of my stay there, I\u2019m typically sleeping on the floor, or a sleeping bag. It\u2019s far from comfortable with a bad back. Plus a good majority of my family hates me because I call out their bs. I got tired of being cordial and being around them. So I\u2019d rather not waste my time or money on them. \n\nSo this year I\u2019ve decided to save myself, the headache, back pain, expenses, and my sanity. \n\nUnfortunately there\u2019s also one lingering issue, my spouse, and I inherited their parents belongings, such as a house, a vehicle, and half of their total finances. I have not told my immediate family what the inheritance amount is, but it\u2019s truly not that much. It\u2019s around $100,000 which is going to be taxed anyways. So we\u2019ll end up with about $70,000 which will pay off debt and go toward fixing up the house. There was some hiccups and unfortunately it\u2019s not considered true inheritance, and it counts as income which is (not) lovely. \nMy spouse used to talk about their parents being really good at saving money and having a pretty good nest egg saved up for them and their sibling to split upon their death. My mother and siblings hearing this assume that we are going to be extremely rich now because the estate closes this month. \nSo for the last two months they have been sending me Christmas gifts they have in mind that I could get them, things, such as phones, computers, TVs, jewelry, and even a $50,000 car. \nI know they are doing this because they know about the estate and I honestly just feel used. I can\u2019t tell them the truth about the estate because they have their minds made up that I\u2019m extremely wealthy either way. \n\nSo AITA for not going because I feel like they only want me there for expensive gifts?", "created_utc": 1668916813, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzujyt/aita_because_i_dont_want_to_go_home_for_the/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
