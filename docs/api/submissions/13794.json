It also has a \"dryer\" setting with warm air, but I prefer to dry with TP, because I find that just like warm air hand driers, it still leaves me a bit damp.

Sorry, I didn't mean to suggest that we all live in log cabins with outhouses or the like... :D  \n\n\nMy apartment is pretty old, and the commode is ridiculously tiny.  I swear, it's like one of those little round ones you find in an elementary school bathroom.", "Omg I did not mean to imply that!!

But I just got flashbacks lmaoooo!!\n\nAlso, sitting=awesome. Why would anyone pee on the seat by choice? I'm firmly in the camp of, kick back, relax, and do your business!\n\nSeriously look into those heated seats tho, they might have em in your size. And it is sooooo nice! Like, this winter I swear the power has been off more than it's been on... And when it is, and I'm not THINKING about it but I sit down on the cold seat... Apparently other people can hear me SQUEEEEEAK from their bedrooms."]}
