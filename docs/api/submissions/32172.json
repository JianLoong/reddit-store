EXH does not drive and lives 90 minutes away.\n\nCURRENT: School called Friday afternoon for me to collect my youngest due to a fever. I asked my mother to pick her up. My mother texted to let me know youngest is quite sick (nasty junky cough, inflamed sore throat, and crying) and probably needs a throat swab. I left work early, and I called around to find an urgent care for her to be seen on a Friday afternoon.\n\nOn the way, I call my ex husband to let him know what\u2019s going on (divorce agreement requires me to let him know if the kids are sick enough that I bring them to a doctor). They are supposed to go to his house for his parent time on Saturday. As expected, EXH is on the fence about taking them for his overnight leaning toward not taking them. He\u2019s leaving the decision in my/the kids court.\n\nWe get through the urgent care visit and get a prescription for 4YO, so I go back to my mother\u2019s house to collect the 8YO. I expressed disgust and frustration at the situation, telling my mother \u201cAnd of course, he doesn\u2019t want to take them.\u201d\n\nMy mother thinks IATA\u2026 she believes that it doesn\u2019t matter if he doesn\u2019t want to take them when they\u2019re sick, and that our divorce agreement says he has to, so I should just bring them over (90 minute ride each way) and drop them off and MAKE him. She believes it doesn\u2019t matter what a 4YO wants and that\u2019s how a court will see it.\n\nOn the one hand\u2026 yes, it\u2019s totally his job to take the kids even if they\u2019re sick. It\u2019s just one overnight and I\u2019ve already done the hard part of getting her to a doctor and getting the prescription. Should he man up and do this? 100%\n\nBut realistically speaking\u2026 the kids will be agitated, upset and afraid the entire time, especially the 4YO. 4YO doesn\u2019t want to go. He will tell them (as he has already told them before) that he can\u2019t take care of them. He has already told the 8YO that if she gets too sick at his house he would need to call an ambulance and she\u2019d need to go to the hospital alone until I can drive over there. Whether or not that\u2019s true is beside the point, IMO. The fact that 4YO is unlikely to be sick enough to need medical services (especially now armed with a prescription) is beside the point. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to abandon them at his house and tell him to man up and figure it out, because he\u2019s not the one who will man up and figure it out\u2026 it\u2019s the kids who will suffer.\n\nEx husband is willing to document whatever decision I make on this. If I tell him 4YO doesn\u2019t want to go, he\u2019ll put it in writing.\n\nWIBTA if I keep the kids home from their visitation, knowing that this is something my ex husband can and should handle but won\u2019t?", "created_utc": 1701507200, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/188zmpu/aita_for_canceling_my_kids_visit_with_their_dad/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He pays for half a full tank of gas.\n\nThe lawyers came to this agreement because he has never driven the entire time I\u2019ve known him. He has a disability that impacts his movement and was in several accidents before I met him. He adamantly refuses to do what needs to be done to get social help for this\u2026 so no free bus or train passes, no dial-a-ride, nothing. He\u2019s relatively functional because he lives in walking distance from a train line now that I no longer drive him places.\n\nThe other \u201csolution\u201d on the table was for me to get an Uber and put the kids in to drive that distance to his house (the idea was that then I\u2019d get all those hours back).

I\u2019ve spent literal years living with him\u2026 it was a mentally and emotionally abusive situation and I got me and the kids out of it\u2026 but I still feel like I don\u2019t trust my judgement.\n\nLike\u2026 it is morally correct that he act like a parent and take care of them even when they\u2019re sick. They shouldn\u2019t be scared and upset to be with their dad when they feel sick. I shouldn\u2019t have to do this crazy drive\u2026 but the reality is that he stays juuuuuuuust inside of our legal agreements. I\u2019ve even consulted with CPS\u2026 he doesn\u2019t \u201churt\u201d them and the only evidence I have is what the kids say after they come home. \n\nIt IS true that if they\u2019re sick enough, it is faster for him to call an ambulance than for me to go get them. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019d actually send them alone or not\u2026 but that\u2019s certainly what he tells them because (as he reasons) he\u2019d have to stay with the other kid.\n\nIdk. I feel very lost. My heart knows the right thing is to keep her with me\u2026 but legally, it\u2019s much more murky. I don\u2019t want to enable him but I don\u2019t want to use the kids as weapons, which is what I feel like I\u2019m doing if I make a sick and unwilling kid go to a place she feels nervous being worrying about what ifs. She\u2019s not old enough to know that as long as he gives her the medicine (I know he\u2019ll do that at least) she\u2019ll be just fine.", "I\u2019d rather be TA for enabling him than TA for hurting my daughters (even by proxy).", "Okay I feel that. Not saying you\u2019re wrong but coddling a grown man and allowing his willful ignorance is just as detrimental emotionally to your daughters especially if you\u2019re not explaining your actions. Do what\u2019s best obviously. But when your daughters grow up and realize you\u2019ve enabled him to be an essential deadbeat through willful ignorance that\u2019s still gonna be trauma that they\u2019re gonna have to work out in therapy. Trust me. My mom took this same stance and my dad died earlier this year and I\u2019m still working on that trauma. Bc now I\u2019m hyper-independent and refuse help from everyone. I barely even agree to entertain men and if I do. I don\u2019t require much of them bc I don\u2019t expect much. I\u2019m now having to teach myself to have expectations from men at 29. So I mean. It\u2019s up to you."]}
