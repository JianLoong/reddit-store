My mother texted to let me know youngest is quite sick (nasty junky cough, inflamed sore throat, and crying) and probably needs a throat swab. I left work early, and I called around to find an urgent care for her to be seen on a Friday afternoon.\n\nOn the way, I call my ex husband to let him know what\u2019s going on (divorce agreement requires me to let him know if the kids are sick enough that I bring them to a doctor).

Like she's damned if she does or damned if she doesn't let the child stay home.  Sounds like a crap father. Why is OP the only one responsible for driving? That's not fair either.", "I can see why he's the ex. \n\nStill, he's willing to go with your children's choice on this matter, and it does sound like this is what's in their best interest. I know it sucks and is lousy all around, but NTA for keeping them home.\n\nDefinitely I'd try to have them call or, better yet, video call - then at least nobody can say you're keeping him from *talking* to them.", "[removed]", "Even better!  Any urgent care will have paperwork, possibly a number to call if any issues. Contact the doctor and ask when the child will be able to travel with their current illnesses and such.  \n \nLikely there will be a chart not added to the file that can be accessed by the child's primary doctor.  \n\nOr call your child start primary doctors after hours line. Since it's the weekend now.  Like I can call my child's pediatricians weekend after hours call system and they will route me to a doctor who will call me back later.\n\nWhen they call you back ask when the child be clear for travel.\n\nAsk for a doctor's note in the chart.  \n\nLike if I call the after hours and ask advice, they will add a chart note and that I will have access through the online portal system for my child's health care information. \n\nOP has anything like that set up.\n\nThis shouldn't be a mom or dad or even child choice. This should be a doctor's.", "And OP having to drive to drop and collect the kids is ridiculous. Especially since he gets to decide when he wants to have them or not", "I hate the way this reads.  She makes it seem like she's annoyed he doesn't want to take them. If we're my kid, I'd automatically say no, I don't want to take him.  He is sick,  doesn't need to be traveling, and exposes even more people to whatever he has. Mom,  grandma, and sibling are already exposed because they live with 4 yo or have been around 4 yo. When my child is sick and has already been in my care, I know what's coming for me in a few days. Why would anyone want to share that with others? He has no transportation and would need to call an ambulance? No,  you don't want your kids there sick.", "This!! Hope OP reads this. Everyone (except GM, who is wrong in this case) wants kid to stay with mom. But it could backfire if it\u2019s mom\u2019s or kid\u2019s decision. Let dad make the decision and document if. You know he isn\u2019t going to say he wants them to come.", "It's in their divorce agreement", "Unaccompanied minors aren\u2019t allow to travel in uber or lyft cars per their company policies. Even if they were, that would be insane.", "Maybe a stupid question but why didn't the lawyers suggest that you bring them by car, and he has to take them back via train where you pick them up at the trainstation? Or isn't there a trainstation in your city?", "Your lawyer is trash and you should get a new one to get full custody. The only reason one parent might ever be solely responsible for transport is if they moved out of the area by choice.", "It\u2019s really not more murky though. You just have to realize that you are truly a single parent in every sense of the word, except for the times when you have to pretend he\u2019s an actual dad instead of just a Saturday babysitter. The Emperor has no clothes, basically. And it\u2019s a farce that you have to consult him on things like letting him know when your kids are sick, bc he\u2019s not the same as you, and clearly doesn\u2019t give a shit.  \n\nIDK what kind of child sharing plan you have where you have to drive to him, unless you moved the 90 mins away?", "You are right to keep them home. You don't want small kids traveling while sick, and they're better off in their own bed. You also have your mom there to sit with them if you have to pop out for fever reducers, Pedialyte, soup etc. It sucks that you lost your free time, but everyone is better off if they stay home.\n\nIf dad is good with you keeping them, keep a text message trail documenting this.", "This sounds like emotional abuse for a child and should be brought to the attention of an attorney who can help safety plan should something happen if the child is concerned about being abandoned by a parent when a medical crisis happens.", "I have a lot of sympathy for her disgust at his refusal to parent properly, honestly. He shouldn't get off scot free from all the hard parts, and if he lived right down the street and the kids spent 50% of their time with him and considered his place equally home and he would take proper care of the sick one, then I'd say he should take them. \n\nBut as it is, all I could think was how miserable the 4yo would be - not just from the presumed lack in care, not just from the long drive, but because who wants to be anywhere but at home in bed when they're sick.", "Yeah, but a good parent is usually worried and stressed by their child being sick.  They *want* to be able to see their kid and know they're going to be okay, not just trying to figure out how to get someone else to handle the illness.", "This and the fact that she specified that she\u2019d get it in writing, it sounds like he\u2019d weaponize missed visits against her too. \n\nThe whole thing sucks\n\nEdited because somehow \u201cfact\u201d was \u201cfuck\u201d \ud83d\ude02", "Never mind that he doesn't drive. He'd have to call an ambulance if she worsened, which he'd probably wait till he knew he had to before he did, exacerbating the entire situation. This woman sounds like she's thinking in terms of her and him and not her children"]}
