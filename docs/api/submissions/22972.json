Nick is not allowed to eat processed foods and has a daily sugar limit. He has no allergies and is a perfectly healthy kid otherwise.\n\nThe cousin cut her birthday cake at the end of the party and cut slices for everyone to take. Eva and her other cousins took a slice and started eating it. Nick went to get cake and Anna stopped him, despite getting cake for herself and eating it. She reminded him that he had reached today's sugar limit and offered him carrots and hummus instead. Nick looked upset and I felt really bad for him. \n\nWhen Anna left to take a call a bit later, I got Nick a slice of cake. I got him a smaller piece and he was happy and ate it. However, he forgot to wipe his mouth and Anna caught him with cream on his face. I saw him pointing at me a bit later and Anna started screaming at me for 'poisoning' Nick with artificial colouring from the cake and going over his sugar limit. \n\nI didn't think what I did was that bad, but when we got home, my boyfriend told me to not override Anna's parenting decisions as she knows what is best for Nick.

Her reaction was also over the top. That said you should not have gone over her head", "YTA.  Don't go against the parent.  Restricting his sugar is a legitimate choice.  Although his mother was kind of a dick for taking a piece of cake herself.", "YTA. The kid is 5, whatever path the parents choose, unless they're actually abusing the kid, for a matter like this you kind of have to follow it. Even if you disagree. At best you could briefly try to convince the mother otherwise, but don't go behind her back.", "YTA. Your boyfriend is correct. It doesn't matter whether you agree or disagree with the kid's parent's decision, and it is unlikely you fully understand all the reasons why the parent has made that choice. Yes, it may be a parent being overly restrictive, and her eating cake in front of the kid is AH behavior.
