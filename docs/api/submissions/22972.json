The fact that she sat and ate cake in front of him is the absolute worst.", "I think ESH, seems ridiculous to have a sugar limit but let him hit it before going to a birthday party where everyone else (including her) is eating cake. Her reaction was also over the top. That said you should not have gone over her head", "YTA.  Don't go against the parent.  Restricting his sugar is a legitimate choice.  Although his mother was kind of a dick for taking a piece of cake herself.", "YTA. The kid is 5, whatever path the parents choose, unless they're actually abusing the kid, for a matter like this you kind of have to follow it. Even if you disagree. At best you could briefly try to convince the mother otherwise, but don't go behind her back.", "YTA. Your boyfriend is correct. It doesn't matter whether you agree or disagree with the kid's parent's decision, and it is unlikely you fully understand all the reasons why the parent has made that choice. Yes, it may be a parent being overly restrictive, and her eating cake in front of the kid is AH behavior. But so long as a parent is not abusing a child - and limiting a kid's processed foods and added sugar intake is far from abuse - stay out of it.", "YTA What if it was because of a medical issue?", "ESH.

That being said, you should not have gone against his mother's instructions.", "First you said it was your boyfriends cousin, then stated he is in fact your husband, then at the end you\u2019ve called him your boyfriend again? I\u2019m confused. YTA for ignoring Anna\u2019s wishes, he\u2019s not your child therefore it\u2019s not your choice what he eats regardless of how you might feel about her restrictions.

And mom should have been more thoughtful - let him have a small piece, split hers, or calculate his daily sugar intake with the cake in mind.\n\nStill, it's her child, her decision, her problem.

She was teasing the dog and say \u201cmmm this is good.\u201d But she didn\u2019t allow the dog people food. My dad, her brother, told her to stop, that it was cruel. She laughed and said \u201cI do it all the time.\u201d The look on his face!!! So he reached over and grabbed her sandwich and fed it to the dog. He said \u201cyou won\u2019t do that when I\u2019m around and if you do I will feed it to him.\u201d \n\nMaybe he was an asshole, maybe he wasn\u2019t.

But every child deserves a little bit of cake.", "YTA. It doesn't matter what you think about her dietary restrictions for her son. He is her son. You cannot be sure you know everything about his health and needs. You are an adult and should behave like one.

I won't.", "YTA. Anna sounds exhausting but you never teach a kid to lie and be duplicitous towards their parents.

Feel bad for the kid, I do too but don\u2019t ever do something like that again. You only override parents if you witness abuse otherwise mind your damn business.", "YTA - sugar effects children\u2019s behaviour, some in an extreme way.

Never good to defy almost to a parent's face boundaries they have established for their child unless they are dangerous or an obvious safety issue.  While this may have looked unreasonable to you, Anna may have a valid reason for her boundaries.  Whatever, to sneak something like that to the child who knows his mother's expectations is not good.  I get where you felt bad for the child, but that is not the main issue here and you should not have taken it upon yourself to override the parent's decision.", "YTA it\u2019s her child why are you wanting to over rule the mothers dietary decisions for her family and child.
