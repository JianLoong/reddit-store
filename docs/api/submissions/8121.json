Are they testing you on how to file a sexual harassment law suit?", "NTA You are not being the least bit unreasonable. Very few women I know would be comfortable sharing a room with a man who wasn't a relative or close friend.\n\nI'm genuinely shocked the school even did this to begin with, honestly.", "NTA, they have policies in place for these situations, they would have had a plan for this if anyone wasn\u2019t comfortable sharing rooms with another.", "As a man in my 30s I would not feel comfortable rooming with a 23 female. Regardless of any attraction level, mutual or not, I would just feel weird. NTA", "NTA.  You are not selfish for not wanting to share a room for the night with a strange man you haven't met before.  Seriously, not at all.  You should not have been put in this position in the first place.", "NTA. They should have looked into this closer and not put you into this position in the first place. You had every right to speak up.", "NTA - You made a perfectly reasonable request. \n\nI would guess that the men going on the trip are actually relieved as well. As a dude, it's much easier to room with another dude than a girl. Need to get changed in a hurry? No problem. Have flatulence? No problem, but you may get laughed at. \n\nSharing a room with a woman in a professional setting would be super stressful.", "NTA. This arrangement is much better for everyone involved. I can't imagine being an older guy asked to room with a younger female and being comfortable with that.", "NTA. You have every right to be comfortable and you shouldn't feel bad at all because they should have arranged a separate room for you instead of expecting you to room with a man you don't know.", "NTA\n\nI've found that women are resentful of other women who know how to express their limits and boundaries. Or jealous of women who get their boundaries respected, when they have not had such luck. \n\nStill,. your friend is an ass.", "NTA. People choose their doctors and massage therapists by gender.", "It wasn't ok for anyone to plan to put a man and a woman in the same hotel room.\n\nI wouldn't feel safe sleeping with a man I don't know in the same room.\n\nNTA", "NTA totally inappropriate for a LAW school to put you in this situation. WTH? This is litigation waiting to happen. This would put you and your male roommate potentially in harms way. Your friend is clueless, too.", "NTA.\n\nThere's NOTHING selfish about what you did,  period. You shouldn't be put in that position and have honestly never heard of a place rooming co-op without asking. Shit I worked at a place that wouldn't even let MY HUSBAND and I share arrangements as it went against company policy to bunk co-op. There are multitudes of reasons people would be uncomfortable with that scenario, and each are damn valid.", "NTA: I believe it is actually illegal for the school to require a female to share a room with a male at a school sanctioned event.", "Nah NTA. While more common with rest rooms and changing rooms, living with the opposite gender free or not is not ok if you aren\u2019t comfortable", "The school should have never put you in a dangerous unorthodox position as this. As someone who was sexually abused I would never feel comfortable being unconscious next to a male stranger.\n\nYou did the right thing speaking up, whoever's in charge needs to do a better job. \n\nIt's critical to avoid sketchy situations like this. Nta!", "NTA at all, very reasonable request you are good", "NTA. Hell no, I wouldn\u2019t share a room with one of those men. I\u2019ve been out of law school close to a decade. Men in this field are still much creepier and ickier and less-impacted-by-the-me-too-movement than the general public. It\u2019s still an ole boys club in more ways than it should be. Sexual harassment is still rampant. Hell to the No. Hell no.", "NTA. Glad you spoke up for yourself! That's an extremely uncomfortable position to be put in as a young women. Completely in your right to say something, surprises me that your friend doesn't share the same perspective. Good luck on your trip!", "NTA\n\nThey should never have expected you to share a room with a man, and you had every right to bring it up.", "NTA and it\u2019s complete inappropriate for them to have even thought about putting people in shared gender rooms.", "NTA. You are fine and the men understand. Don't worry about it, go on your trip learn and have fun.", "NTA.   I work in a male dominated field, and would be uncomfortable if my company said I\u2019d have to room with one of my coworkers.   I don\u2019t have any trauma, it would just be awkward for me.", "NTA", "NTA- you did nothing wrong and I commend you for speaking up! You absolutely shouldn\u2019t be forced to share a room under these circumstances. Your advisor also has a voice and if they weren\u2019t comfortable with sharing then it\u2019s up to them to speak up. \n\nNEVER avoid asking for what you need out of concern of inconveniencing someone else!", "NTA.  I'm surprised this was even an option.  Many jobs I've seen act like you constantly need to cock block someone even if they trust each other.  It was heavily snowing and sleeting and a male manager drove me home.  Trustworthy guy who just didn't want anyone to die.  He even stopped on the way to use his huge ass truck to pull a little car from a ditch.  It was a sworn to secrecy moment despite all being innocent  because he could get in trouble driving a female employee home alone.", "NTA..  Christ,  you used your judgement and realized its a stupid ass arrangement. you passed that class.\n\nany of the dudes would be just as confused and thinking WTF. \n\nI wouldnt want to be rooming with another dude i didnt know, let alone a woman.", "NTA.\n\nIf I was the man assigned to room with you, I would have requested a change, too. That's just not a good situation for either of you to be put in.", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised that they didn\u2019t have measures in place to prevent this sort of situation. \n\nNot all men, sure, but enough men would take advantage of that situation that it\u2019s best to avoid it all together.\n\nI\u2019m glad that they were able to figure something out for you, and you should be too.", "NTA.\n\nWhat made them think this would be a good sleeping arangement (the orginal sleeping arrangements)? I don\u2019t blame you for being uncomfortable", "Holy shit NTA. What is wrong with your school?? Do they not understand if you are assaulted they are liable for a MASSIVE lawsuit? Tell your friend she can go bunk with strange men if she wants, you're not only NTA but you would pretty much have to be an idiot to be ok with this.", "NTA.  As a man I would not want to share a room with a woman either.  Far too much potential for awkwardness, accidental privacy violations, and serious misunderstandings.", "NTA. That room assignment was a recipe for disaster. You made c the smart move.", "NTA.  I\u2019m amazed your university doesn\u2019t have policies in place already to prevent lawsuits.", "NTA\n\nAs a male there is no way that I would consider running with a female acquaintence.  As you mention, its an unfair position to put you and the men going on the trip in.", "NTA.  It's not wrong to be uncomfortable with the idea of sharing a room with a guy who is much older than you that you may not know that well.", "I'm of 2 minds.\n\nOn one hand, I'm fine with not wanting to share a room period.\n\nOn the other, I feel like if this was a more female dominated role, like teaching, and a man refused to share a room with women because he didn't feel comfortable, and he got his own room while they all had to share, it would be looked at very differently.\n\nI guess NTA.  4 to a room is entirely too many for a bunch of strangers.  Its really too much even if you know each other.  So I don't love that the school set it up that way.  But I do also feel kind of icky about the way this all went down and everyone but you ended up sharing a room while you got some place to yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have absolutely every right to say \"I'm not comfortable\" to anyone and anything that you're feeling uneasy about.  Your advisor may be a volunteer but that does not trump your need to feel SAFE.", "NTA. There is nothing unreasonable about it. \n\nThe school should have known better to start with, and they should have provided proper accommodations for the entire group in the first place. \n\nThey have instead chosen to book the accommodations incorrectly - twice. \n\nYou have nothing to feel guilty or wrong about.", "NTA, an extremely reasonable boundary to put in place.\n\nIf the advisor wants or needs their own room they can take it up with the school, the terms of their employment and accommodation are between them and their employer.", "NTA!!!!! So much NTA!!!!! And these men should very well be able to understand this. Most normal men would not be at all surprised that a woman doesn\u2019t want to room with them on a trip like that. Most normal men wouldn\u2019t take it personally. Bummer for the advisor, I guess? But it is what it is on that end. You are NOT THE ASSHOLE!!!!!\n\nMany of us have trauma and even those who don\u2019t are aware of others who do. I had to go to urgent care for something recently that was very sensitive and I wept when I was told they didn\u2019t have any female doctors working at the time. I had to hide my face in my boyfriend\u2019s chest while the doctor helped me. They both understood and were very kind about it. This is a normal reaction for you to have!", "Nta.  \n\nWhat your school did was odd.   Is your game gender neutral (like Leslie or Parker)? Cause that's the only way that this should have happened", "Im sorry WHAT?! How fucking dare they! That is begging for a law suit.\n\nI get where you are coming from OP. I have trauma around older men as well. And im so sorry you had to go through that. You are NTA at all!", "NTA. I wouldn't share a hotel room with a man I'm not comfortable with. Period.", "RIGHT? How stupid can a LAW SCHOOL be? How do they not understand they are so liable if OP was assaulted?? Like huge huge easy to win lawsuit. OP, are you sure they're actually accredited and all? This seems like a really bizarre thing for a law school to do.", "This would never even be considered in a work event. \n\nIt's a terrible idea in so many ways.\n\nNTA", "THIS", "I\u2019m also really confused how this happened. There\u2019s quite a few events like this happening in different cities, and my school definitely has more women than men. Last time I did this event, I was actually with all women. I think someone must have overlooked our genders, because this is just odd.", "To be fair, they didn\u2019t tell me I had to share a room with a man, they just said that there were two rooms shared between the four attendees and there\u2019s usually two people per room. I\u2019ve done this event before, so I preemptively told them I didn\u2019t want to share a room with a man.", "To be fair to them, they aren\u2019t complete strangers. Like we go to the same law school so I know of them, just not them very well. They seem nice, but I just feel weird about the whole thing. \nAlso, yay for shared trauma.", "Yeah they seemed nice, but sexual harassment in the legal field is still really bad, even with all the advances.", "I don\u2019t know if this makes a difference, but it\u2019s actually two to a room. I actually think I\u2019d be a bit more comfortable if it was all four of us in a room, but maybe not. \n\nAlso, while law is predominantly male, my law school has more women in it (probably like 60/40). That\u2019s another thing about this situation that makes it so strange.", "It\u2019s really odd. I think the school might have just overlooked the gender placements of us, and I\u2019ve done this event in the past, so I preemptively told them I didn\u2019t want to room with a man when I found out the placements for the event. They seemed understanding, for what it\u2019s worth.", "I remember forever ago hearing about some weird mixup at a university where they somehow paired up two students in a woman's dormitory but one of them ended up being a guy.\n\nSo I'm going to assume it was something similar. Especially if you're saying that's not how it worked in the past. Because...This just sounds like a truly terrible idea.", "Good on you for checking. After you graduate, you might want to suggest they review their policy of how they reserve rooms so this doesn't happen to someone else.", "Classmate=/=safe.  You did the right thing.", "Ah ok, I misread how the room situation went. \n\nAnd again, I totally get not wanting to share a room period.  I'm having a hard time expressing WHY I feel not great about this situation."]}
