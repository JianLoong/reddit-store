{"id": 14137, "submission_id": "12djhml", "title": "AITA for telling my bio brothers I have no interest in getting to know them, even after they spent years looking for me?", "selftext": "I (18F) have two biological brothers (20M, 27M) We were taken from our birth parents when I was two, due to some drug issues they had. We spent two years being shuffled around temporary foster homes before we ended up in an abusive one. My oldest brother apparently reported them, and after that we were seperated as staying together was less important than us being safe.\n\nI ended up with my adoptive parents after that. We had another two years or so of spotty visits and calls with my brothers, before both of them ended up in permenant homes that didn't allow any contact. I was six at the time, so I really have very few memories of my brothers. Anyway my parents are great, and I have a sister and brother (15F ,14M) who are my parents bio children, and we have a great relationship\n\nThe other month, a few weeks after my birthday, my parents got a call from my oldest bio brother. I guess he was able to get more information after I turned 18, and wanted to meet me. He explained to them that after he turned 18, it took him two years to find my other brother, and they've been looking for me ever since. I told my parents I'm not interested in any contact however.\n\nThe way I see it, blood doesn't make family, and I really have no reason to see them. I already have siblings, and I'd see it as of betrayal of them and our parents for actually having a relationship and raising me. My parents respected my choice, but told me to think on it, since he also told them he blames himself for us getting seperated for reporting the abuse. I get that, but really don't see that as something for me to solve.", "created_utc": 1680785759, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12djhml/aita_for_telling_my_bio_brothers_i_have_no/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Look, I'm usually all for \"you dont need to have relationships with anyone you don't want to\" but you realize your brothers likely spent years of your life protecting you from abuse, right? You have no reason here not to have contact with them? Feels a bit weird to call you anything but the asshole here for deciding you want nothing to do with these people who care about you very much, for basically no reason, without even trying to meet them and learn anything about them and see if you like then. Maybe tell them youre not ready for that step right now and work through whatever shit you're not telling us about here with a therapist?", "YTA simply for the dismissive way you talk about bio family. Yes, it\u2019s your right to not have contact but they literally did nothing wrong. They actually protected you by reporting the abuse. It\u2019s not their fault they got separated. You come across as quite mean and detached. For no good reason. \n\nBrothers are probably better off not knowing who you have become.", "I don't think I can give a judgement here, but you seem very cold about this. You have two brothers who care enough to have looked for you and want to reunite, but you just can't be bothered in the slightest? I get that blood doesn't make family, but I don't see how acknowledging them hurts or betrays what you have. It doesn't erase what sounds like a wonderful and healthy childhood your family gave you and your parents don't seem to have an issue with it from what you said in your post. It doesn't have to be an either/or situation to have contact with them and talking to them doesn't require you to keep talking to them. Maybe they didn't have the good luck you did and are just wanting to check on you, hoping you have better than what they did, that you are OK. It's ultimately up to you, obviously, but knowing at least some of what you all went thru, having no empathy for them makes me think you probably aren't as over your past as you're letting on, maybe even more than you realize at this point.", "It sounds like you are blaming your bio brothers for the things that happened to you in your childhood. They aren\u2019t responsible, they were children too. Generally it is better to have more love in your life than less. Sounds like your adoptive family knew this when they adopted you. YTA", "> I'd see it as of betrayal of them and our parents for actually having a relationship and raising me.\n\nNAH, but this is a bad (and inaccurate) take.  Your own parents are telling you to \"think on it.\"\n\nIf you don't want to meet him or have a relationship, this is fine, but you aren't betraying anyone with this.  My foster niece was separated from her bio siblings - as adults, we are VERY upset about this separation on her behalf, but also can just focus on her.  Your parents aren't mad at your bio brothers, and they also knew what they were getting into.\n\nIf you are using this as an excuse and just don't want to open that Pandora's box, right now, that is completely fine.  You had a rough childhood and maybe it's better to let sleeping dogs lie.  Or, maybe you can find a middle ground right now where you just write your brother a letter telling him some general info about yourself so he knows that you are doing ok. Tell him about your family, where you are in schooling, some things you like.  He's 9 years older - and now, as an older sibling w/ a brother 7 years younger... you are also HIS baby.  Trust me that he thinks of you as his responsibility. He just wants to know that you have a good life. (I'm sure he would love a relationship, but I think for now, he'd be satisfied with knowing you are happy and having a better life).", "YTA for treating them so harshly for something beyond their control. \n\n\"Actually having a relationship with me\" is such a snarky fucking comment- are you SERIOUSLY blaming those *literal children* for not being allowed to contact you? They saved you all from abuse, tried their best to stay in touch, and searched for you for years. Blaming them for not having a relationship and considering them trash who you want nothing to do with is unbelievably cruel.", "I think that he Is better off without you, you are doing the right thing by protecting him", "YTA\n  \nhe saved you from years of abuse. he had no control over being seperated or having no contact in the new home. Now that he is able to find you, he did and this is your response ?!?! Most foster kids only DREAM of being able to have this happen. \n  \nAdditionally, solve what ?  He wants to reconnect with you to make sure you are ok. You come across as very callous.", "YTA - you\u2019ve not considered your brothers feelings or have any empathy for them. They\u2019ve gone out of their way to find you and must be extremely disappointed.", "YTA. Your bio brothers are better off without you jn the picture. You are selfish.", "YTA, you sound very cold and detached", "Might have voted differently until I read your comments.\n\nYTA and pretty heartless like other people have said. You are doing your bothers a favour by refusing contact, I would be disgusted by the person you turned out to be.", "YTA. You sound like a very cold person. And you sound like you have some unresolved issues around your childhood that you should probably look into with a therapist.", "Your brother saved you from a bad situation and ultimately is responsible for getting you into the one you are in now. \n\nThe lack of contact was court ordered so he had no means to stay in touch with you. \n\nYou are right that blood doesn't make family but they are family and in this world - you can never truly have enough people in your life who truly love and care for you. \n\nYour brothers are responsible for the life you have - the least you can do is meet them and thank them.  \n\nYTA", "YTA. I don't understand why you're so indifferent and cold in your post AND your comments, but you're definitely in denial of whatever emotional issues you have.", "YTA.\n\nHe definitely spent years grilling himself over what he did to keep all of you safe and has probably thought of you daily. Cried about you. Lamented. Grieved. Motivated to find you out of love.\n\nI wish someone would try to find me because they love and protect me, not because they like to see me all messed up for doing things to improve my life.\n\nEdit: And honestly, you don\u2019t deserve his love.", "NAH.  But do not burn the bridges with him just yet.  You might change your mind later, no matter how unlikely that may seem now.  It really would not be betraying your current siblings either.  You still love them and see them as your actual family.  So maybe just meet with him once or twice and see how things play out.  Your current family solved your problems but perhaps your bio siblings were not so lucky.  You are not on the hook for fixing anything but it might help him to know you a tiny bit better.", "Soft YTA. You're totally right to view the family that raised you as just that, your family. But you seem oddly cold and detached toward your bio brothers for no real reason? Older bio brother may feel guilty, but he was a kid in a bad situation who had no control over what happened, and his actions prevented years of abuse and got you to your loving family. Has anyone in your adopted family actually insinuated they would feel betrayed if you met with them? Your parents seem supportive. You don't need to have a relationship with your bio brothers if you don't want to, but you can't even give them the courtesy of just once meeting or talking with them to at least say that you're not interested in maintaining a relationship with them but wish them well? I'm having trouble grasping how you seem to have no empathy whatsoever. This doesn't feel like you're protecting the feelings of your adoptive family, this just feels like you can't be bothered to take a single phone call because it mildly inconveniences you. Damn.", "You really are just a bad, selfish, close minded person. Do what you want but your reasoning is truly nonsensical and idiotic.", "YTA  \n\n\nYou sound cold-hearted. This isn't your birth parents coming back into your life; it is your siblings who were teens when they were separated from you. They must really care about you if they spend years trying to find you.  \n\n\nYou have a right to not want a relationship, but your reasoning is cold and they would probably be better without you. What can you lose by having some more loving family?", "YTA and I don't know how you don't see yourself otherwise. You sound like a cold hearted brat who doesn't deserve their attempt at connecting.\n\nGrow up.", "NAH but I'd really consider it, it was not their choice either to grow up without you and it does not in any way make your new siblings any less that.", "YTA. You are acting like it\u2019s your brothers fault that you were separated when in reality, it\u2019s not! They were kids themselves and were going through the same thing you were. Also your brothers obviously love you and want to see you. That is such a good thing that many adoptees don\u2019t have. If your siblings don\u2019t support you meeting your brothers that shows they are selfish.", "YTA, your bio-brothers reported abuse, to protect the three of you, and that got you your family. You're a callous person for going 'eh fuck 'em'.", "YTA. You dgas because your adoptive parents didn\u2019t raise them? Even though it was none of your fault you couldn\u2019t be together? He probably thought about you all the time wondering if you were safe after the incident at the fosters. AH AH AH.", "NAH. You do not have to go out of your way to spend time with someone when you are uncomfortable with it. However, I'll admit I'm not sure I understand how having a relationship with your blood relatives is a betrayal of your adoptive ones. Of course you don't have to \"replace\" your adoptive family with your blood ones. I just hope you are able to reach some kind of compromise that everyone is comfortable with someday without completely shutting the door on your brothers.", "Going with NAH but leaning YTA. I get it, you are in a good place and don\u2019t want to change that. That\u2019s your call. Your bio brother has every right to want to check on you and establish a relationship, that\u2019s his call. He was old enough that he had established and recognized love for you and the other brother and has held that love for years. I am actually more concerned by your answers and what I see as rationalization in the comments. OP have you ever had counseling? Whether you have memories of those early years or not, you experienced a trauma and I think that may begin to show itself in your reactions to some things. \n\nYour posts states you don\u2019t want to betray your parents, but they want you to think on it so clearly they won\u2019t feel betrayed. You then repeatedly state you don\u2019t want to be responsible for a grown man\u2019s feelings. This is concerning. You aren\u2019t responsible for his feelings and he isn\u2019t \u2018sad\u2019 and looking for a relationship with you to fix everything. He, too, experienced trauma and at an older age where it affected him more tangibly. It\u2019s not on you to fix his struggles, but reaching out to his sister who he has cared about for the past however many years also isn\u2019t a \u2018struggle\u2019. A grown up doesn\u2019t stop loving someone just because they no longer have to see them. I\u2019m much more worried about your confusion or maybe intentional kid-understanding of his motivations. Again, you don\u2019t have to establish a relationship with him if you aren\u2019t ready or don\u2019t want to revisit certain parts of your life, but your words here are blaming this on him rather than you understanding your own wants and needs. I think by your own words and reactions it\u2019s clear your consciousness is struggling with your past and how you feel about it, which is normal and understandable, but shutting the door and never reflecting and working through those thoughts is unhealthy.", "Wow, YTA. You can't even give them the courtesy of a call? It's not their fault that the permanent homes they were in didn't allow them to have contact. The lack of empathy here is...wow. You are looking it this all wrong. You could be BUILDING another bond, increasing your circle, and not betraying your adoptive parents because they are the ones that told you AND told you to think about it before dismissing your bio brothers. At least give it a shot with an open heart and mind, in my opinion.", "NAH, I think this is a really difficult and traumatic situation for all involved and it's none of your faults or responsibilities. I personally would reflect on your decision - simply meeting or speaking to them isn't necessarily a betrayal of your family, and it doesn't mean you need to try and forge a 'family like' relationship if you don't want to. But it could offer some form of comfort or relief to your brothers, and if you don't feel it would cause you to go greatly out of your way or cause you harm, maybe it could be worth it? You're right that it's not your responsibility but it could be a small gesture that would mean a great deal to them, and even give them a form of closure even if you choose not to meet again.", "NAH, though I would try to reflect on why you believe meeting them/having contact with them would be a betrayal of your family. It sounds like you might need to think about that.\n\nWhile you were 6 last time you saw them, your eldest brother was 15, the middle one 8, both very much minors and had very little say as to whether they could stay in contact with you or not. Imagine being in that position with your younger siblings and perhaps you\u2019ll find some compassion there. \n\nHopefully they can also understand where you\u2019re coming from and respect your decision, even if it\u2019s not what they wanted.\n\nWhile you don\u2019t \u201cowe\u201d them a relationship, I don\u2019t think it will hurt you to know where they are/what\u2019s going on with them, even only through social media.", "Info: why would it be a betrayal of your adoptive family to know your biological brothers?\n\nLove is not something that runs out, you will not have to take love away from your adoptive if you want to give any to your bio brothers.\n\nDo you think parents with multiple children have to love each child less individually with each new baby born?\n\nBecause that's not how it works, it works like the Grinch, the heart just grows bigger.\n\nIf you don't want to know your bio brothers for any reason that's your decision and I won't call you an A for it, but I can't pretend it's not gutting to see it's based on the premise that doing so would be a betrayal of your adoptive family.", "YTA they deserve at least a chance and some of your time. Your own parents told you to think about it, you say you have a great relationship, so you should listen to their advice - which hundreds of strangers agree with. Dont be afraid op, they won't feel betrayed.", "I would understand if you said this about the bio parents who were neglectful and caused this all. You were their sister for SIX years. They protected you for six years. You genuinely don\u2019t think that counts for anything at all????? That is 1/3 of your life. If your 14 year old brother was taken away when he was 6, wouldn\u2019t you have wanted to meet him again when he\u2019s older to make sure he\u2019s ok?????????", "I am adopted and would love to find blood siblings. These brothers cared for you and still care for you. I would try and find it in your heart to have a relationship with them.", "NAH\n\nBut your adamant refusal to have anything to do with your bio brothers does make me wonder if, somewhere deep down inside, you harbor some anger at them or blame them in some way for something that happened to you.", "While you're NTA for not wanting a relationship with your bio brothers, YTA for how you refer to them and your callous disregard for their feelings. It's not your job to fix their feelings, sure, but to not even care about how hard your bio brothers have had it and how hard things have been for them after losing you and each other, gives me huge AH vibes.\n\nIt's not about having a relationship with them, it's about actually caring about people who go through hard times and having even a miniscule amount of empathy for other humans. I would at least meet them to help them find closure, then go back to your life and let them know you don't want further contact. It's not a hard thing to do, especially if you don't care about them THIS much, but it would mean the world to two people who have made it their life's goal to find their little sister they got separated from due to abuse. Appeal to your conscience.", "NAH your brother's arent AHs for looking for you, and you're not an AH for not accepting contact, though I agree with your parents about thinking about allowing at least one meeting so they can see you're ok and happy.", "Soft YTA\n\nI understand some of your feelings - I was adopted the day I was born (in another country; my godfather was from there and brought my parents). I've never had any interest in bio family, even tho my parents were always open to it etc. If anything I always had curiosity about my godfather bc we were close but he died when I was little. But, I've also never known any of them, literally. I also have had an extremely privileged life and feel both that it could be awkward to contrast that, and also, my language skills are only OK in what would be their primary language. I don't feel any attachment and one of the reasons is that meeting would be to satisfy a very minute amount of curiosity that I have... but might lead to them wanting a relationship, which I honestly would not really have interest in. \n\nThe thing is: that is not your situation. You have actual siblings, who remember you, who loved you, who have been searching for you. You \\*DO\\* have shared history, and trauma, and probably similar characteristics. I mean you have shared language, too. \n\nI think you need to realize that pushing them away is more of a defense mechanism than a choice. No one is going to take anything away from you. Your family will still be your family - it will just grow a little. That doesn't hurt anyone.", "OP, you seem too cold. Nothing says you have to have a warm close-knit relationship with them but to not meet at all? If nothing else, could you give your brother(s) a sense of how your life is working out and how you found a good family and how maybe just maybe what he did was right? Even if you don't have room in your life (I didn't have room in my life when my father wanted to reconnect) for a relationship (Heck that's hard even for bio family that was raised together).\n\nNow, if they were wanting to reconnect due to wanting money or a kidney....we can change the AITA question, but right now, I have to say YTA", "I\u2019m torn btw N A H but based on your comments would say soft YTA right now. It\u2019s valid if you are not ready or mature enough for this conversation yet as it sounds like you are not yet capable of recognizing how much he likely did for you and the hurt he saved you from. At this point, it could cause more hurt and potentially regret on both sides. I would take the time to reflect and think about it like your parents suggested and perhaps work on unpacking the real whys past \u201cI have a family.\u201d", "YTA. Love is not limited to certain number of people, you know. If you meet your bio brothers and like them, it doesn't mean you'll love your other siblings less.\n\nYou can meet and see who they are, what men they became. If you don't like them, if you don't feel connection, you can always  stop communication. But they clearly still care about you, so bluntly refusing too meet them is heartless.", "Yea, YTA. \n\nLook, you aren\u2019t obligated to care about these people. You aren\u2019t obligated to meet them.\n\nPart of being a well-adjusted human is having empathy. You may not care about these people, but they certainly seem to care about you.\n\nYou were all separated as children and they took the time and effort to find you after all these years. Can you imagine how they must feel? They were likely worried about you for years. They finally found you after a decade of separation. And you straight up reject them? Not even a letter to say you are happy and healthy? It took your oldest brother 2 years to find your other brother because locating former adoptees is very difficult and time consuming. He did that _for you._\n\nIntrospection might do you some good.", "YTA. Is this even a real post, because I can't imagine a person being so callous to men that saved your life. Did your mother use drugs when you were in the womb? It's kind of weird that you would be so completely unfeeling to your own family and you think sibling love is the same as romantic love.\n\nIcky.", "There was no reason for you to come to AITA. You're being rude in the comments to people answering YOUR QUESTION. I think your brothers are better off without you. You're not kind. Do you owe them your time? No. Would it be nice to give closure to someone who was worried about you their whole time in the system? Yes. YTA.", "NAH. You aren't the AH for not wanting to meet them. And they aren't the AH for wanting to see you.\n\nJust a thought, though. Your eldest biobrother would have been about 15 when you were split up. Not much younger than you are now. Imagine if you did something tomorrow, something to save your younger brother and sister from suffering. You didn't do anything wrong, but you can *never* see them again. What would it mean to you, after more than 10 years, to see them just once?\n\nYou're right, you don't owe them anything. But it isn't a betrayal of your family to see them. Your family isn't somehow less because your biological relatives have found you. You don't owe them anything, but it would cost you so little and mean so much to them.", "NAH but the way you refer to your bio brothers seems like projected feelings about your bio parents.\n\nThey went through the same as you and maybe didn't get the great family you did.", "The most generous interpretation is that OP has a deep rooted serious fear of abandonment, for obvious reasons, and is scared.\n\nScared of her adoptive family abandoning her if she gives them any excuse, like calling her brothers brothers.\nScared of her brothers abandoning her after she welcomes them into her life.\n\nThe commments she makes seem cruel and nonsensical at first glance, but if you look at it as someone who's at their core scared of being abandoned by family, then of course she doesn't want to meet her brothers and risk being rejected. Of course she comes up with nonsensical excuses. And of course those excuses again demonstrate that fear of abandonment.\n\nOP, absolutely NTA. But you are scarred and need to look for ways to heal these scars, or they will destroy your future relationships.", "NAH it\u2019s completely fair that he wants to reach out to you. He was older and feels that responsibility even if it was completely out of his control and not his fault. He has more memories of you \n\nBut absolutely you are not the asshole. In any way.

You may find you feel very differently when you're older, so don't burn that bridge now. You can take it really slow, have limited contact i.e. occasional coffee out or something,  with the support of your parents, and just see what happens.

He never had any desire or intention of meeting anyone in his bio family. His adopted family was his only family in his eyes. Well, a few years ago my sister decided to do an ancestry DNA test. She ended up finding his half sister and reached out(dad was pissed). After talking about it with his mom, he decided to reach out to his HS, mostly for any possible pertinent medical information. A little while later he was a couple hours from where she lives for a fishing trips, so he decided to go meet her. They enjoyed their time, took a couple pictures and went on with their lives. I think they still text randomly, but she is in no way a part of our lives, despite being a lovely person.\n\nUltimately, it's your choice. You don't owe them anything, but what harm would it be to spend an hour at lunch? Bring your parents so you're more comfortable, get a free meal and brothers could get some closure(especially the older one w/ the guilt.)", "NAH. But gently, having more people in your life isn\u2019t a betrayal of your family. \n\nSome of my kids were adopted from foster care too. I\u2019m adopted.

But family isn\u2019t a competition. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to spend time with folks you aren\u2019t interested in. But you don\u2019t have to choose your family over your birth family.

However I would hope that you don't have to have forever 'lost' your bio siblings in lieu of the wonderful family you ended up with. I don't personally see it as a betrayal and I would hope your siblings would not either. I would imagine it feels to your bio brother like you harbor resentment towards him.

This is a very personal choice and it\u2019s yours to make. If you aren\u2019t comfortable with it, don\u2019t do it. You can always change your mind later. You don\u2019t have to explain yourself.", "NAH. Your brothers have carried years of guilt for trying to protect you in a way that caused you all to be separated; your phrasing that the authorities felt \"that staying together was less important than (us) being safe\" rather than safety being the priority suggests to me that perhaps you felt abandoned. But they were children, too. It's not your responsibility to heal their trauma, you're right about that. But I have a question: Is having contact with your bio brothers dredging up traumatic memories of the abuse you all experienced, or even just the fear of those memories coming up? If this is even a small part of your decision, please address it through counselling. Even if you never see your bio brothers, carrying that trauma can affect any relationship you may have with people outside of your family (you feel protected with them).", "NTA. It\u2019s your choice.", "NAH. Ultimately it\u2019s your choice. But other posters have some good advice. You\u2019re right, blood doesn\u2019t make family\u2026 but it sounds like you resent your brothers when you say \u201cI\u2019d see it as a betrayal of our parents for actually having a relationship and raising me.\u201d Your brothers we\u2019re minors too.

Make sure you don't regret your decision. if you're scared you will hurt your parents (foster or not) by meeting them don't. by the sound of it they want you to be happy and care about you. They don't mind you trying to connect with your other siblings, they know you're their son. if you don't believe me ask them about their thoughts.\n\nI hope I helped you a bit at least and good luck mate.", "NAH I think your parents are right that you should think very carefully on this.  You're not wrong, blood doesn't make you family, but they literally spent years looking for you, that's a lot of effort and does suggest that they'd be great brothers.  I'd also add even though he blames himself, the older of the two clearly took some incredibly brave decisions to help all three of you at an extremely young age and if that's not what big brothers are for I honestly don't know.  \n\nThat said in no way does that invalidate your feelings, this is an incredibly difficult and sensitive issue and you can't make a wrong decision here.  If this is too painful, if you can't get past the idea that this would be a betrayal, that's OK.  You're allowed to feel that way and no one should tell you otherwise.  However, if you can push through it then it seems like what you're going to find is not that your relationship to your family is any less for it, but only that there's more people in the world who love you and miss you, that your family could simply be getting bigger.", "NAH. These are a bunch of kids who had traumatic childhoods and have done the best they can. It\u2019s good that OP is doing well. But I do hope you can at least have some compassion for the fact that your brother does know you and does remember you, even if you don\u2019t remember him. You were a very important person in his life and he\u2019s missed you for well over a decade. You aren\u2019t responsible for his feelings. But that doesn\u2019t preclude you from acknowledging that it is very understandable that they both want to know you now. You are their little brother. They love you. That doesn\u2019t go away.

Some can't wait to get in contact with their families when they turn 18 and others harbor a lot of resentment towards them.

You seem to think that you have to choose one or the other, which is not the case.  \n\nThe other thing is you don't have to embrace them and play happy family - you can meet them for dinner and just talk and slowly get to know them.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (18F) have two biological brothers (20M, 27M) We were taken from our birth parents when I was two, due to some drug issues they had. We spent two years being shuffled around temporary foster homes before we ended up in an abusive one. My oldest brother apparently reported them, and after that we were seperated as staying together was less important than us being safe.\n\nI ended up with my adoptive parents after that. We had another two years or so of spotty visits and calls with my brothers, before both of them ended up in permenant homes that didn't allow any contact. I was six at the time, so I really have very few memories of my brothers. Anyway my parents are great, and I have a sister and brother (15F ,14M) who are my parents bio children, and we have a great relationship\n\nThe other month, a few weeks after my birthday, my parents got a call from my oldest bio brother. I guess he was able to get more information after I turned 18, and wanted to meet me. He explained to them that after he turned 18, it took him two years to find my other brother, and they've been looking for me ever since. I told my parents I'm not interested in any contact however.\n\nThe way I see it, blood doesn't make family, and I really have no reason to see them. I already have siblings, and I'd see it as of betrayal of them and our parents for actually having a relationship and raising me. My parents respected my choice, but told me to think on it, since he also told them he blames himself for us getting seperated for reporting the abuse. I get that, but really don't see that as something for me to solve.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. I would say you do not want to meet them now but keep the door open. It is not a betrayal of your adoptive family to meet them. I am sure they remember you much better. \n\nMy daughter is 22 and met her adoptive family at 16. She stays in touch with a younger sister but overall does not have much contact with them but appreciated getting to meet them.\n\nIt is wonderful you have a family that you love. \n\nYou do not have to meet your brothers but you may want to someday and if you do it is not being disloyal.\n\nI would send a letter and a picture of yourself to your brothers that shows you are safe and happy. Tell them you do not feel comfortable meeting them now. Wish them well. \n\nYou may want to know them when you are older or if you have biological children. You may have questions about your birth parents.\nI would leave the option open to meet them at a later date and just say at this time you do not want to meet. Tell them if you want to at a later date you will.", "YTA.  You don't necessarily have to have a relationship with them if you do not want, but I think to totally ignore them, especially based on your remarks, is callous and cold.  They just want to know that you are okay and you should at least give them that chance, whether its in person or in email/text.  \n\nI do feel there's more going on here, especially with you and likely buried/repressed feelings and memories (especially with abuse) that you're afraid to deal with.  While it seems like its better to leave that all buried, let me tell you, doing so has consequences in your life later on or possibly already as we see here.  I highly recommend therapy to talk this over vs. leaving it ignored.    Most of us can sense that you are bitter and cold and its going to only get worse the longer you ignore it.  It will affect any future relationships and likely any existing ones as well.    From someone that has gone through something similar and has been seriously messed up as a result.  And yes, therapy helps as well as dealing with the past issues slowly and cautiously instead of ignoring them.", "NAH - it\u2019s up to you. You sound cold and unemotional about it and it\u2019s unfortunate for your brothers who obviously want to know you and the situation you\u2019re all in isn\u2019t their fault. But again, it\u2019s up to you. All the YTA comments are so confusing to me. This is your life and you get to choose.", "I\u2019m not going to call you an AH. \nI am going to gently ask you to rethink your hasty decision. You may regret it.\nAnd your parents are ok with it. \nYou\u2019re young and probably really nervous but how about a dinner with brother and your parents? Just think about it, yes?", "NAH. As a fellow adoptee, I totally understand your POV. You were young when you found your family, and since you have a good relationship with them I get why your biological brothers don\u2019t feel the same. I actually have a similar perspective of my adoptive family being my family, and have a plan in place in case any biological members found me and reached out to go through legal contact rather than personal contact. In your case, there were extenuating circumstances that were traumatic for them since they were older. If you feel you can, could you communicate in order to give them closure and reassurance that those choices back then were valid? Could you have contact without being forced into a familial reconciliation? Could you talk to them more as human to human with compassion rather than with any familial expectations? Only you can answer those questions. But I wanted to let you know that I completely understand your perspective and first instincts. However, I think there\u2019s a bigger picture of hurt and healing here. Maybe your adoptive family could help you through that as well. Also maybe talking to a counselor or therapist would help you gain perspective as well. Good luck.", "My heart does go out to your older brother especially, who was nine when you were all taken into care, eleven when he got you all out of the abusive home, and about thirteen when you lost contact. \n\nI get that on the other hand you were two, then four, then six. Clearly you integrated more easily with your adoptive family and have fewer memories and less sense of attachment than your brothers - especially your older brother - did. Not to mention you had parents who didn\u2019t insist you cut contact with your brothers. They sound like kind and caring parents. At the very least your brothers could do with knowing that you\u2019ve had a good life and family, that your older brother doesn\u2019t need to worry what happened when he couldn\u2019t protect you. Which he did. If it had only been you and middle brother who knows what could have happened. \n\nYou might not feel any bond with him, but he was a thirteen year old who lost contact with the baby sister he was with since you were born. He has a much clearer memory of those years. There would be a lasting hurt there. \n\nI do think you could be kinder about it and maybe bare in mind that your parents don\u2019t seem to ever have had a problem with you staying in contact with your birth siblings. Not least the older brother who saved you from abuse.\n\nSo I\u2019m not blaming you or calling you an ah. But have you really thought about those numbers? Can you imagine losing contact with your other siblings when you were that age?", "Idk if you are an AH but I\u2019m surprised that you aren\u2019t at all curious finding out about your brothers. Perhaps you don\u2019t have a memory of them. I think it was respectful of your bio brother to contact your parents. And it sounds as if your parents are ok with your interest in meeting with them based on telling you to think it over. I wouldn\u2019t look at your bio brothers situations as owing them anything or a chance to fix or replace anyone or anything. It\u2019s ok for them to want you in their life. It\u2019s also ok for you to not want them in yours. I would simply suggest you talk to your adoptive parents and siblings and see their point of view because I don\u2019t think they would see it as being replaced. Meeting and having a friendship with your bio brothers isn\u2019t a betrayal to your family. Leaving them and not contacting them because you found your \u2018real family\u2019 would be. I think your heart is in the right place not trying to hurt your family. Just take some time to think, talk it over with your family.", "Op is 18, still a teenager, and as a former teenage girl myself, I know situations that make you uncomfortable can result in you responding in a rather cold fashion. I won't give a verdict here, but I will say this. Getting to know your bio brothers is not an insult to your adoptive family. There is always space for more love. Open your heart, OP. Everyone deserves more love in their lives, including you.", "YTA for not even giving them a chance. They clearly love you and have wanted to make contact for a long time. You\u2019re not given a finite amount of love to give that must be budgeted sparingly. The heart can expand and love many people in your life. If your concern really is that you feel that it\u2019s a betrayal to your adoptive family, then you should be open and honest with them and see if that\u2019s how they would feel or if they\u2019d be open to you letting someone else in.", "YTA", "NAH It sounds like you've all been through a lot, and you are young, and maybe feel like you're finally in a stable and loving family and don't want to jeopardize or change that?  No one would blame you for feeling that way.  Your dismissiveness and bluntness is probably a defense mechanism, and avoiding them keeps that part of your life away.\n\nHowever, I don't think you should close the door on your bio brothers completely - I think it's totally fair to say this caught you by surprise, you understand they've been looking for you and want to see you, but you aren't ready for that right now.
