Mine is 3, hers is 5. Vicky is no longer with her daughter\u2019s father, and now has a new boyfriend, Cody (28). \n\nFor as long as they\u2019ve been together, Vicky has brushed off Cody\u2019s issues with dating a single mother as him not liking kids. He can never babysit because he doesn\u2019t like kids, he\u2019s never able to help her out with errands because he doesn\u2019t like kids, he chose to sit far away from her on the plane because her daughter hates planes and \u201ckid noises\u201d bug him. She seems happy with him so whatever, I just went with it. When I saw them, I noticed how he wouldn\u2019t engage with her daughter. Her daughter is not the best behaved, I\u2019ll admit (loud, not great manners, restless), but not so far off the scale that it wold send someone running. But Cody won\u2019t hold her, play with her, and the second she even moves in his direction he\u2019s calling for Vicky to do something. I get not wanting to be \u2018daddy\u2019 right away and I get not liking kids (I\u2019m not such a fan of other people\u2019s kids myself) but I always felt like he was taking it to the extreme for someone who was willingly dating someone with a kid. \n\nAnyway, Vicky, her daughter, and Cody came to visit me at home for the first time for two weeks. I was expecting Cody to ignore my daughter as he does Vicky\u2019s, but after a couple of days, he took a liking to her. He would draw with her, if she brought him a toy he\u2019d do a little impression with a funny voice for her, he even joined my husband in teaching her how to swim. He hasn\u2019t been over the top, just way more accommodating of her than I expected, and it\u2019s really put in perspective his attitude to Vicky\u2019s daughter.\n\nVicky has chosen to ignore this, like won\u2019t even look in his direction if he\u2019s near my daughter. \n\nYesterday Cody and I were sitting out by the pool and Cody was reading a book, and Vicky\u2019s daughter came over and asked him if he\u2019d come and play with her. He said he was busy. She got a bit upset by this and started tugging his arm and whining. Eventually he just snapped \u201cget off me\u201d and went inside. Vicky came out straight after and soothed the whole thing with an ice cream. I told Vicky that Cody was a bit rude and she said \u201cwell, he tries, but you know how he is, he hates kids\u201d. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t think he hates kids Vicky, I think he just hates yours. He\u2019s better with my daughter than I was with kids before I had her. This isn\u2019t a dig but I really don\u2019t think this problem is what you think it is\u201d. Vicky took offence, called me an AH for insulting her parenting and her boyfriend and went back to the guest house (where they are staying). \n\nShe\u2019s been off with me today. I know maybe I was a bit harsh and it wasn\u2019t my place but was it really so bad of me to bring up a problem she is clearly not acknowledging?", "created_utc": 1692448438, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vf3xf/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_her_boyfriend/", "score": 12, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's willing to let her child suffer because she doesn't want to disturb a status quo. \n\nAt the same time, I don't think Cody hates Vicky's daughter. He seems to try to avoid any form of responsibility as a father figure. He plays with OP's kid because it's safe and doesn't mean anything. He wants to date a \"single\" without \"mother\".\n\nRegardless, his attitude is borderline abusive, so the \"why\" is not so important. Vicky has to admit they have a big problem.", "NTA.

Denial.", "NTA. It\u2019s not a healthy environment for Vicki\u2019s daughter. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s her parenting that annoys Codi or the child\u2019s temperament, but they both need to do what\u2019s best for the kid and break up or take parenting classes.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you necessarily should have said \u201cyour boyfriend hates your kid\u201d, but I can completely understand your concern & how bad this could be behind closed doors/where Vicky is refusing to look. You were a little presumptuous about it, but I honestly think it sounds like you had a reason to be concerned.\n\nI do, however, think you should apologize to Vicky for assuming stuff and instead suggest that her & Cody have a conversation about what they both want out of this relationship. If Cody doesn\u2019t want to be a dad, having a longterm relationship with someone who has a child isn\u2019t gonna work, and they need to talk about that.", " NTA - This infuriated me to no end.

Do you honestly believe you have enough information to speak about what Cody thinks about kids?\n\nPerhaps he\u2019s being polite because he\u2019s staying in your guest house for vacation & he has enough manners to understand that you may not appreciate him blowing off your kid in your home.\n\neta \u2014 just out of curiosity since you seem very invested in this situation ... why didn\u2019t you ask Cody the question when it happened? \u201cHey Cody ...

Pretty sad.", "NTA. She is trying so hard to ignore this situation. She has hurt feelings but not hurt enough to leave because she would have to tell Cody why. What a strange situation. Both adults should call it quits for the sake of Vicky's daughter, there is no future for them.", "Hmm I find this odd she is choosing to stay in a relationship with someone who so clearly wants nothing to do with her child, very sad for the child really.", "NTA for bringing this concern up- they need to figure some stuff out, because it isn't okay for Vicky to take a front seat to watch her bf hurt her child's feelings, and Cody should have enough situational awareness to know that this isn't fair or sustainable. And I'm speaking as someone who generally hates sharing space with kids, but am fine with my partner's son. If he wasn't compatible for me to be around, I wouldn't be, because I'd hate for him to grow up feeling someone's active disdain... like Cody seems to be doing. \n\nSlight TA for how you pitched it. Maybe Cody really doesn't like kids, but yours doesn't trigger him in the same way, like my situation. Maybe he's so worried about being put in a dad role that he's overcorrected to being colder than necessary. That's something for them to discuss.", "Munters?

But if someone had acted like that towards my child I would want to know so I mentioned it to Vicky, and her response kind of floored me. It\u2019s her choice to be with Cody but I think it\u2019s a bit weird that she looks at the way he is with her daughter and presumes it\u2019s fine because he hates all kids and then won\u2019t acknowledge that he\u2019s capable of being decent to one.", "(New Zealand, Australia, slang) A person often impaired by alcohol or recreational drugs", "Why are you not holding the person with the rude behavior responsible for his behavior.

You\u2019re not doing your daughter any favors by allowing this jerk around her\u201d", "These Y T A comments are wild. Maybe you could have focused more Cody himself than seeming to \"single out\" Vicky's kid, and perhaps when she's cooled off you can encourage her to have a talk with Cody about their future, but these people are hung up on wordsmithing. The important thing to communicate was that his behavior around one particular kid is unique.", "Ah, thanks", "In UK it\u2019s an ugly older woman, probably of loose morals", "So, what I said was too much, because Cody might not dislike kids, but saying all that wouldn\u2019t have been over the top?", "You can do two things at once. Hold the person with the rude behavior  responsible  as well as point out to the parent it seems like the person they have chosen to have a relationship doesn't seem to like their child. Cody's behavior towards Vicky daughter is going to have long-term negative effects on her daughter's emotional well-being if her mother allows her to grow up around a man who doesn't like children.  This relationship isn't good for her daughter which should be Vicky's # priority.", "Was just about to comment we use it in Scotland as well lol", "What you said is .... it\u2019s your daughter\u2019s fault that Cody an asshole.", "If this happened at my house I would have immediately called Cody out on his behavior. \u201cWTF dude ... why can\u2019t you just play with her?\u201d Or at the very least just called it the way I see it ... \u201cseems obvious to me that you don\u2019t want to be responsible for kids so why are you with Vicky?\u201d I think that would be way less offensive than OP\u2019s comment. \n\nAppears Cody has no interest in being \u201cDaddy\u201d or being responsible for any kids. He doesn\u2019t like OP\u2019s kid more .... he\u2019s not responsible for that kid. He played with her because she\u2019s someone else\u2019s kid. He doesn\u2019t hate kids he hates being responsible for kids. \n\nImo ... OP thinks Vicky\u2019s kid is annoying so she is guessing that is what Cody\u2019s issue is. After reading this I think Cody is a dick & Vicky is an idiot for trying to create a happy little family with a guy who has no interest in playing house. Let\u2019s stop blaming the kid & throw the adults under the bus. All of them.... actually I think ESH"]}
