He can never babysit because he doesn\u2019t like kids, he\u2019s never able to help her out with errands because he doesn\u2019t like kids, he chose to sit far away from her on the plane because her daughter hates planes and \u201ckid noises\u201d bug him. She seems happy with him so whatever, I just went with it. When I saw them, I noticed how he wouldn\u2019t engage with her daughter. Her daughter is not the best behaved, I\u2019ll admit (loud, not great manners, restless), but not so far off the scale that it wold send someone running. But Cody won\u2019t hold her, play with her, and the second she even moves in his direction he\u2019s calling for Vicky to do something. I get not wanting to be \u2018daddy\u2019 right away and I get not liking kids (I\u2019m not such a fan of other people\u2019s kids myself) but I always felt like he was taking it to the extreme for someone who was willingly dating someone with a kid. \n\nAnyway, Vicky, her daughter, and Cody came to visit me at home for the first time for two weeks. I was expecting Cody to ignore my daughter as he does Vicky\u2019s, but after a couple of days, he took a liking to her. He would draw with her, if she brought him a toy he\u2019d do a little impression with a funny voice for her, he even joined my husband in teaching her how to swim. He hasn\u2019t been over the top, just way more accommodating of her than I expected, and it\u2019s really put in perspective his attitude to Vicky\u2019s daughter.\n\nVicky has chosen to ignore this, like won\u2019t even look in his direction if he\u2019s near my daughter. \n\nYesterday Cody and I were sitting out by the pool and Cody was reading a book, and Vicky\u2019s daughter came over and asked him if he\u2019d come and play with her. He said he was busy. She got a bit upset by this and started tugging his arm and whining. Eventually he just snapped \u201cget off me\u201d and went inside. Vicky came out straight after and soothed the whole thing with an ice cream. I told Vicky that Cody was a bit rude and she said \u201cwell, he tries, but you know how he is, he hates kids\u201d. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t think he hates kids Vicky, I think he just hates yours. He\u2019s better with my daughter than I was with kids before I had her. This isn\u2019t a dig but I really don\u2019t think this problem is what you think it is\u201d. Vicky took offence, called me an AH for insulting her parenting and her boyfriend and went back to the guest house (where they are staying). \n\nShe\u2019s been off with me today.
