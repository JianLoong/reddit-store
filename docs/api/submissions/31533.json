We get along well, I respect her etc.\n\nExcept for one problem: she brings junk into my house every single time she comes. Sometimes it\u2019s cloaked as a \u2018gift\u2019 - Here\u2019s a Xmas towel I got at Walmart for 99 cents! Other times it\u2019s something she desperately \u2018needs\u2019 - Oh, it\u2019s so cold at your house I need to keep wool slippers here. And lately, she just sneaks stuff in.\n\nThings that have appeared at my house under one of these guises:\n-Fuzzy slippers x 3 pairs (all 3 pairs are here)\n-Corvette mugs x 4\n-Two more random mugs\n-TJMaxx wine glasses, I box\n-Floor rugs x 2\n-Knife sharpener \n-Sweaters, coats, dress shirts etc.\n-Special pillows x 3\n-Towels, bedding, blankets \n\nAnd of course insane amounts of food we don\u2019t eat, cheap toys for the kids, and random small stuff like hairbrushes and socks and stuff.\n\nEverything is presented with the declaration: it wasn\u2019t expensive, if it bothers you, you can throw it away. \n\nWe have tried talking to her. I have tried explaining that I don\u2019t have room for this stuff and I really don\u2019t want to throw away uneaten food and brand new toys because it\u2019s wasteful, but nothing helps! Every time it\u2019s: oh it\u2019s just something small or oh it\u2019s (daughter\u2019s) birthday so we brought shitty apple pie. Yes, but I spent 2 days baking so she had cake and 3 special desserts, then you guilted your son into eating one slice of the pie and the rest was thrown away!\n\nToday we got a text telling us that she has shipped an office chair to our house. Because apparently sometimes grandpa likes to nap in office chairs and I guess the other 3 we have aren\u2019t good enough? Grandpa comes to visit us about 3 times per year. Since they only live 2 hours away and just bought a giant truck, we asked that they take grandpa\u2019s office chair with them when they leave and bring it back next time he comes out (which will probably be April).\n\nSo, AITA for being annoyed and asking them to take the giant office chair back with them?

This triggered some MIL PTSD for me. My former MIL was a shopping addict and a legit, grade A hoarder.

Usually had dead insects inside. She gave me hoards of junk and costume jewelry. I was a 20 year old, wth was I going to do with any of that? \n\nWhen I was pregnant, she went into overdrive, buying as much second hand baby stuff as she could find. But the majority of it was useless. Stained and ripped bassinet sheets. We didn't have or plan to get a bassinet. Stained and ripped baby clothes, of both genders, even though we knew we were having a boy. Broken toys, missing pieces or parts. The list goes on. \n\nNo matter how much I BEGGED her to please stop with the \"gifts\", and my husband was much harsher with her (he had a lot of trauma from growing up in the hoarded, filthy home and with parents they spent money they didn't have in their shopping addiction while he and his brother lacked necessities, and certainly couldn't have anything extra), she would just burst into tears and sob about how \"unwanted\" and \"unappreciated\" she was. \n\nWe had taken to just throwing everything out immediately. Usually to the outside trash right away, to avoid a potential insect issue in our home. Husband threw things in the trash right in front of her. She would hand him something, he would walk over to the kitchen trash can and drop it in. She would just sit there with this freakishly blank stare. Some people just can't function normally.

And lately, she just sneaks stuff in.\n\nThings that have appeared at my house under one of these guises:\n-Fuzzy slippers x 3 pairs (all 3 pairs are here)\n-Corvette mugs x 4\n-Two more random mugs\n-TJMaxx wine glasses, I box\n-Floor rugs x 2\n-Knife sharpener \n-Sweaters, coats, dress shirts etc.\n-Special pillows x 3\n-Towels, bedding, blankets \n\nAnd of course insane amounts of food we don\u2019t eat, cheap toys for the kids, and random small stuff like hairbrushes and socks and stuff.\n\nEverything is presented with the declaration: it wasn\u2019t expensive, if it bothers you, you can throw it away. \n\nWe have tried talking to her. I have tried explaining that I don\u2019t have room for this stuff and I really don\u2019t want to throw away uneaten food and brand new toys because it\u2019s wasteful, but nothing helps! Every time it\u2019s: oh it\u2019s just something small or oh it\u2019s (daughter\u2019s) birthday so we brought shitty apple pie. Yes, but I spent 2 days baking so she had cake and 3 special desserts, then you guilted your son into eating one slice of the pie and the rest was thrown away!\n\nToday we got a text telling us that she has shipped an office chair to our house. Because apparently sometimes grandpa likes to nap in office chairs and I guess the other 3 we have aren\u2019t good enough? Grandpa comes to visit us about 3 times per year. Since they only live 2 hours away and just bought a giant truck, we asked that they take grandpa\u2019s office chair with them when they leave and bring it back next time he comes out (which will probably be April).\n\nSo, AITA for being annoyed and asking them to take the giant office chair back with them?

I say boarderline because her hoard is limited to her attic (I'm waiting for the ceiling to cave in), her 3 spare bedrooms, and her garage. Her mother was the same way, only it  was in her garage, basement, attic, and 2 spare rooms. Floor to ceiling \"stuff\". You could not enter the rooms, you could not open the doors fully. \n\nDuring all the lockdowns, she decided to clean her house somewhat. By dropping all her garage \"stuff\" off on my porch. I have 6 kids, and 5 were still at home during this. My organized basement and garage storage shelves are full of their stuff and odds and ends of stuff from mine and my husband's youth. She brought 4 extended bed pick-up truck beds full of garbage (garbage to me, sentimental stuff to her) over the matter of a week. It ended in a screaming match (not one of my better moments) with me telling her that if she put 1 more item on my property, I was going to call a moving company and have them haul all the crap she dumped on me back on their porch, along with my husband who thought this behavior from his mom was ok and that he could help her clean out one of the spare rooms because that's where he would be living. \n\nShe quit bringing stuff over, and I called a dumpster service to come and drop off a dumpster so I could get rid of the garbage she brought by. Fast forward 6 months, and both her parents died within a week of each other. So she was now responsible for cleaning out their house.\n\n1 week into her cleaning out the house (same floor to ceiling type scenario), my neighbor texts me while I was at a doctor's appointment to tell me there is a woman with a pick up truck full of stuff and she is putting it on my porch. I call my husband, he sees nothing wrong with this and goes home and piles it all in the living room, leaving a path to get into the kitchen. I come home just as she is emptying her 2nd load onto my porch. A screaming match later (this time I could care less if the neighbors hear) and me hauling every last item back into her truck, she finally left. I filled the inside of the cab of the truck and just threw stuff into the truck bed. It was severely overloaded. I threw a tarp and roped over it, and told her to leave. She had to drive it all back to her parents' house, doing 15mph because the truck was so packed. The best part was that she got pulled over and got 2 tickets. 1 for impending traffic and 1 for an oversized/improperly secured load. She asked for reimbursement for the tickets from me. I said no.\n\nThought that would be the end of it, but she called my husband and tried to SELL him the crap that she tried dropping off on my porch in order to pay for the tickets. Needless to say, I now have a firm boundary (and I absolutely HATE that I have to say the word boundary to her) that she can not bring her truck onto my property period. If she comes to visit, she has to bring her compact car and park in the street. She is also not allowed in my home if she has any bags (including her large purse). She has been told that if she brings an automobile onto my driveway or tries to enter my home with a bag, I will call the police and have her trespassed. This has worked very well. It's been 2 years, and she still shows up on occasion with her large purse. So I stand in the doorway, blocking it and making sure she visits my kids and husband on the porch or driveway.\n\nI agree.
