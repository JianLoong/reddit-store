You could've talked to your sister first, maybe she could've made an arrangement  with her ex to allow the girls to come to the wedding with their mother even though its his month. Or even asked your ex-BIL if he'd be willing to do that. You didn't even try any options.", "YTA. Should have discussed it with your sister and had her discuss moving the weekend so the kids could come to the wedding. You essentially completely disregarded how your sister would feel and also if their relationship is bad it's likely you would also be creating a very difficult situation for the kids too because they are the ones who are actually in the middle.\nI realise it's on the parents to be civil around them but that doesn't mean they will be.", "YTA", "YTA. I think your sister is right\u2014you\u2019re jealous. I don\u2019t think this had anything to do with the kids. You wanted her ex there to highlight the fact that they\u2019re divorced. You didn\u2019t even bother asking your sister to make arrangements for her own children to attend, you jumped right to \u201cwelp, ex has to be there, no other option!\u201d", "YTA - your sister could have worked something out with her ex-husband to get her nieces for this special occasion.

You could have told your sister the date in advance so she could get her kids for a day or so, or work it out with her ex to just drop the kids off. You didn\u2019t *have* to invite ex BIL too. You just wanted to stir up drama with your sister. \n\n6 weeks sounds awfully close to the wedding to send out RSVPs.  For those who have planned weddings, is it?  I invited people to a super bowl party 2 weeks ago; 8 weeks for a surprise bday party. I understand I like to plan in advance; so I\u2019m genuinely curious on the proper timeframe for wedding rsvps.", "YTA. If you care about your sister, why didn\u2019t you have a conversation with her about this? You took the hard route and made her feel like she doesn\u2019t matter.

So many ways this could\u2019ve been handled better", "So why didn't you ask your sister if she couldn't bring her children with her to your wedding? That's the 1st thing most other people would have done. Instead you blindsided her and you know she's on bad terms with her ex.

I find it awful that you don't care about your sister at all. You invited her, you didn't bother to let her know ahead even though you know they are on bad terms and you had the nerve to tell her that you rather have him at her wedding than her. I guess you do hate your sister and i this case you don't have to invite her but the way you handled it is awful", "YTA. You didn't even talk to your sister before inviting her ex? You obviously want your nieces at the wedding, but the two could have worked out a plan to make that happen.", "YTA. You don\u2019t bring the ex around when your sister is there unless she is ok with it. Plus your sister couldn\u2019t just ask to take them?

With the exception of abuse or violence, a divorce doesn\u2019t mean you write off the other partner. If my brother divorced his wife of 7 years you better believe she is still invited to everything in my future. She has become my sister and a sibling. You can\u2019t ask your family to love and accept your partner/spouse and then to write them off as soon as you divorce them. So there is absolutely a reason to invite the ex. He will always be the father of her nieces and, if they had a good relationship, he will be a sudo-brother to her forever as well.", "Honestly holding and pushing the date for at least a full month wouldn't be reasonable, the venues still packed with all the \"we were supposed to get married in 2020\" cases so the priority needs to on getting the place secured.

My aunt (mother's sister, in her 60s) first met my dad when she was 12.  She's seen my dad as her \"older brother\" her entire life.  She was always happy to see him at any family event.  She tolerates my mother because \"family.\"  \n\nI feel like we need more information here from OP.", "There's always the possibility that former BIL and OP actually do have a better relationship than the sisters as well - just because they're blood related, that doesn't mean a good sibling bond. Still, wouldn't hurt at least a heads up.", "there's nothing to imply OP and ex BIL are close, OP only invited him to ensure that the kids are there.  So many other ways to do that.", "I had wondered if it was a job schedule thing. If one of them has a job where they are work something like 4 weeks on, 4 weeks off.\n\nIts an odd schedule. But they definitely exist.", "My sister and her ex live clear across the country from each other. They do year on/year off and the kid visits the other parent on holidays. The whole family thinks this is an insane arrangement. The kid is 8, so we are waiting for them to say they don\u2019t want to do this anymore quite soon.", "You two are like the only logical people here! When people divorce it\u2019s not like everyone just writes off the other partner. You have made the choice to bring this human into your family\u2019s life and then the choice to divorce. With the exception of abuse and such, you can\u2019t expect your family to now just act as though your partner never existed as was never apart of the family.", "Could also be true.

I do because my blood always has my back. My chosen relationships are great too, but family is important. Family always has your back and my friend recently learned that too. She put a lot stock in chosen relationships but when she was almost homeless her distant cousin whom she grew up with was the one who offered her a room. None of her chosen family could do it. Edit: she doesn\u2019t live in my state, so she couldn\u2019t crash \n\nFamily dynamics matter too. Just like the post I read the other day, guy doesn\u2019t put stock in blood relations then got upset that they didn\u2019t contact him when he was sick. He literally said he never keeps up with family but got upset when they did the same. As long as you are cool with the same treament more power too you.\n\nI\u2019m grateful that I have a family and one that will always have my back, not everyone has that. So I will stay grateful and loyal to my day 1\u2019s. It\u2019s nothing like talking to my cousins or aunts even compared to my besties. My family will ride for each other always.", ">Family always has your back\n\nSadly, that's not \"always\" the case.  There are plenty of stories on this sub (including this OP) of family not having each other's back.  (I mean how often do you read stories about mom's/dad's choosing their new spouse over their bio-kids?)\n\nYour \"blood always has my back\" sounds like your bio-family is also your chosen family.  You're lucky.  Not everyone can say the same.", "Please read it again. \n\nI said I\u2019m eternally grateful for my family. I also said family dynamics matters. I have some chosen family too, my dad calls them his bonus daughters. Reasons above that people toss family is because of OP. Putting the ex-brother in law before her sister. That\u2019s shows disregard for her sister and breaks a relationship. A lot of family are not taught to care for each other and I feel like I\u2019m todays world people toss familial relationships aside. Look at the person whom responded, she doesn\u2019t have a strong relationship with her sister, doesn\u2019t mention any trauma, but would pick her BIL first because she likes him. I\u2019m picking both my sisters always.", ">I\u2019m grateful that I have a family and one that will always have my back, **not everyone has that**. \n\nI missed that the first time, because you repeatedly say \"Family always has your back\".  That is the case for you (and I am genuinely happy for that).  But your fist paragraph reads like \"family and family only has your back\".  And the second paragraph rightly blames a guy for expecting his family to have his back when he puts nothing into the relationship, stating he is the problem.  While I agree that he in that case is the problem, your basically stating in the first two paragraphs that blood family is what's most important.\n\nYou put blood family first.  You have valid reasons for this.  That works for you.  But that doesn't mean it works for everyone.\n\nMy story: my parents were married for 39 years.  They finally divorced after years of misery, due in part to my mother being abusive.  My cousin on my mother's side got married in 2019 (years after my parent's divorce) and invited my father to the wedding and not my mother.  She always had a great relationship with my dad, still does.  She didn't invite my mother because she was afraid my mother would make a scene (like she does at every wedding, graduation, baptism, etc) and because my mother basically ghosted my cousin after my cousin told her she was pregnant.  (All my cousin wanted was the occassional \"how are you doing\" texts, but my mother refused to do that).  So my cousin chose someone else over a blood relative.  She has no regrets.  And I supported her decision.", "They guy I used as an example ;\n\n\nHis family would reach out and offer help, he would say they don\u2019t matter and everyone for themselves. So when he finally needed help, they said everyone for themselves because whenever they asked him. He said they were adults and don\u2019t need him. They weren\u2019t even asking a lot, like a ride to store when the car broke down. A visit at the hospital when sick. He told them he\u2019s no obligated to help them with shunting. I understand that no one owes you anything but it\u2019s good to pass on good karma and help out because you never know when you need it. It doesn\u2019t mean let people walk all over you, but it\u2019s good to help out family and friends. \n\nI don\u2019t blame your mother or cousin. Your cousin chose to cut that relationship and your mother kept it closed off. I have some family members that do the most, they get invited. I\u2019m not shamed easily and other family members will step in to keep the peace. She just ignored your mom and didn\u2019t invite her, I bet she was hurt. I would personally be hurt. Then she just expected to pick up a relationship. This is like OP , her sister is hurt and will probably think she holds no consideration for her. It\u2019s a shame a relationship ended because of a wedding.", "I just mean that people want you to be family, but treat you how OP treats her family. With complete diresgard for their feelings and then expect them to be there when you are down. I have 21 first cousins and we stay in touch as much as we can. A cousin I haven\u2019t seen in a year asked to crash for a month. I said okay with no hesitation. I didn\u2019t ask why, just cleared out the space because she\u2019s been there for me, why not be there for her. I have never crashed at her place but we talk. She ended up leaving an abusive relationship and we got her settled later. That\u2019s what family does, we try to be there."]}
