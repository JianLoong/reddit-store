About 6 months ago Jake started dating Dani (27 or 28 f) and she started spending most of her time at his place as well and she basically moved in. So I see her almost every time I hang out with Jake.\n\nDani is fine, she always seems nice enough, but there is one thing that just bothers me about her. And that\u2019s her food. In the few months I\u2019ve know her, I have seen her eat some of the most bizarre and gross looking foods. Examples:\n1. She ate a bowl of crackers (like regular big square ones) with milk like it was cereal.\n2. A sandwich that was just butter and sugar.\n3. Strawberries and milk on top of biscuits (like the American ones).\nAnd way more examples that I didn\u2019t put here. Usually I just ignore it, but today she made something that I just couldn\u2019t ignore. She put pimento cheese spread on a hotdog bun and ate it with laoganma (an oil with chiles). I wanted to gag when I saw it. \n\nI told Jake when I sat back down what she was eating and he just looked over to the kitchen and back at me and just shrugged. I told him \u201cwhy does Dani always it the weirdest sh*t?\u201d Jake rolled his eyes and told me she could eat what she wanted and that\u2019s when I told him that it was weird she always seemed to eat the grossest sh*t imaginable.\nAnyway, after that he got mad and told me I should go home and I did but on my drive back he started texting me saying I was disrespectful to his girlfriend and he didn\u2019t think I should come over to hang out until I apologized. I honestly don\u2019t think I did anything wrong and it\u2019s not like I told Dani herself I thought her food was gross.", "created_utc": 1683947638, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13g5mx2/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_his_gfs_food_is/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I just meant a butter and sugar sandwich would be a delicious snack too lol", "YTA\n\n\nAlso- bread with butter and sugar is a poor people food. Like I'm german and my gran made it for me. But for example it was thing in the great depression in the us too. \n\n\n\nHer food choices might be werid but honestly not even close gross in my opinion. \n\n\n\nYour behaviour on the other hand... not cool. I thought this was a post about her pushing you to eat something but you have the audacity to fucking demand a justification for her to eat what she wants at her bfs house... who the fuck are you? Also... get the fucking hint. Your friend told you before you made a morpn out of yourself that she can eat what she pleases.", "YTA\n\nThis isn't about food.\n\nYou are trying to drive a wedge between Jake and Dani.\n\nJake is having a grownup relationship and apparently you resent this.\n\nTime to grow up.", "YTA.

It's not your business what she eats.  Nobody needs your commentary.", "YTA I won't lie the food doesn't sound appetizing to me either, but it really doesn't fucking matter does it? She's not asking for you to eat it, and nobody asked for your opinion. You're inserting yourself when it just wasn't necessary. Learning how/ when to hold your tongue would probably serve you well.", "YTA. Mind your own business and don\u2019t keep talking ill of his gf when he\u2019s clearly not interested AT HIS PLACE.

Who cares what someone else eats? She wasn\u2019t eating it at YOUR house, or at your dinner party. She was at her bf\u2019s house not yours. \nYou should be grateful that she liked you well enough to be comfortable around her guy and his pal to eat whatever she wanted, instead you made it odd.

What we eat is tied to culture, class, taste, and of course identity and image. A lot of people have eating disorders. A lot of people have food sensitivities. A lot of people have sensory issues that limit what they can eat. As long as nobody shoving food you don\u2019t want down your throat, leave it alone.\n\nApologize, and mean it", "YTA. Do you want to continue to be friends with Jake or not? If you do, apologize. It won't kill you, even if you don't think you were wrong. \n\nAnd if you think what she eats is the \"grossest imaginable\" your imagination is lacking. I can think of a lot grosser stuff than that, mostly involving raw fish. \n\nMy grandmother used to eat bread and milk, in a bowl like cereal, and I remember being given butter and sugar when I was a child. Maybe that sort of thing is a tradition in Dani's family.", "Had no idea some of these would be considered weird. YTA mind your own plate.", "YTA.\n\nNo one asked you. \n\nAlso, what's so weird about biscuits, milk and strawberries? \n\nAnd why does extra peppers in pimento cheese gross you out so bad?

Now?  It's sushi and you can get it at the grocery store.  What you find nauseating might well be somebody else's gourmet treat.", "YTA\n\nNo one asked you. Also, no one offered you this food. None of this is your business. You said something mean to your friend about someone he likes/loves, and you don't seem to think that you have done anything wrong?

It honestly sounds like you are jealous and just looking to pick on her ::::goes to kitchen for bowl of milk n crackers::::", "YTA. \nWhy do you care so much. How does it affect you? You aren\u2019t eating it, you don\u2019t live there and have to smell it, and you aren\u2019t the one kissing her after she eats it. And the things you described really aren\u2019t that bad. You\u2019re being a judgmental AH for no reason.", "I think YTA. These all seem like more normal things to eat to me. Growing up in poverty, we oftentimes ate crackers in milk, sometimes with peanut butter. The butter and sugar bread as well. People grow accustomed to eating stuff like that and find it enjoyable. \nAlso, it is just weird to comment on what other people choose to eat imo", "Every dumb thought that crosses your mind doesn\u2019t need to be verbalized. YTA, learn when to just say nothing. It really comes in handy.", "Even from your first paragraph you sound soooooo jealous.

Food insecurity forces you to get creative. But, even if that has nothing to do with it, why are her food choices under your scrutiny? What's the goal here? Do you want her to appease a guest, in what is essentially her house, who isn't even eating it???", "YTA. She wasn't trying to force you to eat it. What's the problem?", "Eh NTA- it\u2019s straight up an honest question lol why *does* she eat weird shit like that?! Your friend is a little soft and if it were my best friend, I could 100% tell her this and she\u2019d probably agree with me", "Her meal choices are quite gross and good you didn\u2019t tell her directly.
