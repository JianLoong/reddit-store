I mean what real Asian is called (FAKE NAMES) Max Johnson?\u201c\n\nMax ignored him before talking about something else with my brother. This pissed off my grandpa and he started yelling at Max saying that just because he\u2019s gotten a little taller doesn\u2019t mean he can disrespect him.

But I interrupted them and was all like \u201chim being tall is pissing you guys off? You know he can\u2019t control that right?\u201d \n\nMy grandparents were shocked that I had spoken up and said that it\u2019s not him being tall, it\u2019s his \u201cgoddamn attitude\u201d. So I told them that he\u2019s literally talking about hockey and sports-just like my brother is. Did they want him to apologize and say \u201coh I\u2019m sorry sir, of course you\u2019re right. I\u2019m a fake Asian. How dare I find hockey entertaining.\u201d Like no person in their right mind would say something like that. I ended with \u201cy\u2019all are sounding real crazy.\u201d\n\nWhich pissed them off and my grandma started screaming at me for mocking them and trying to humiliate them (brother and Max were laughing). \n\nI didn\u2019t think I was the asshole because well wtf? But when all the parents got back with the food, my mom and aunt sorta yelled at me for talking back and making them mad. They said that I should\u2019ve done what Max did and ignored them because they\u2019re old and don\u2019t know any better but instead I created a whole bunch of problems when the situation doesn\u2019t even concern me.
