He\u2019s half East Asian so he looks nothing like our very white family. I think he\u2019s pretty cool, as do most of us. But my grandparents are weird about it. \n\nMy grandparents are very ignorant and my aunt doesn\u2019t see them unless it\u2019s an emergency or an entire family thing. \n\nIt was my grandfather\u2019s birthday yesterday which is an entire family thing and so everyone was there. \n\nIt\u2019s been a while since my grandparents had seen Max and he had a growth spurt. So basically he\u2018s now 6ft 2 and a little built. The tallest of all the men in the family. They greeted him like they did everyone else so I assumed they didn\u2019t care.\n\nMy brother and Max were talking about some hockey game that was happening. My grandpa walked over to them and was all like \u201cI didn\u2019t know Asians liked hockey but then again you\u2019re fake Asian right? I mean what real Asian is called (FAKE NAMES) Max Johnson?\u201c\n\nMax ignored him before talking about something else with my brother. This pissed off my grandpa and he started yelling at Max saying that just because he\u2019s gotten a little taller doesn\u2019t mean he can disrespect him. My grandma butt in and said \u201cAsian folk aren\u2019t usually this tall so he must feel like something standing here with all these smaller white men, well Max you\u2019re still Asian-don\u2019t you forget it.\u201d \n\nMax looked so confused and so was I. But I interrupted them and was all like \u201chim being tall is pissing you guys off? You know he can\u2019t control that right?\u201d \n\nMy grandparents were shocked that I had spoken up and said that it\u2019s not him being tall, it\u2019s his \u201cgoddamn attitude\u201d. So I told them that he\u2019s literally talking about hockey and sports-just like my brother is. Did they want him to apologize and say \u201coh I\u2019m sorry sir, of course you\u2019re right. I\u2019m a fake Asian. How dare I find hockey entertaining.\u201d Like no person in their right mind would say something like that. I ended with \u201cy\u2019all are sounding real crazy.\u201d\n\nWhich pissed them off and my grandma started screaming at me for mocking them and trying to humiliate them (brother and Max were laughing). \n\nI didn\u2019t think I was the asshole because well wtf? But when all the parents got back with the food, my mom and aunt sorta yelled at me for talking back and making them mad. They said that I should\u2019ve done what Max did and ignored them because they\u2019re old and don\u2019t know any better but instead I created a whole bunch of problems when the situation doesn\u2019t even concern me. My grandparents were still pissed at me before we left and my grandma won\u2019t stop talking about how disrespectful I am.

They\u2019re starting to really lose it. But I\u2019ll be honest, the only reason my grandparents didn\u2019t have a heart attack when my aunt adopted Max was because Max is half white and looks it. He doesn\u2019t look like a \u201cstereotypical Asian\u201d which comforts and bothers them at the same time. It\u2019s sick.

So knowing that his cousin has his back probably helped. And you're right to wonder, I'm wondering myself. Is she in denial about them being racist or something?
