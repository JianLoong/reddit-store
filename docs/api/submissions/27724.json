There really isn't much excuse for her to not learn if she was interested. Heck, Televisa/Univision has filmed some telenovelas in Miami.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you assumed based on her looks alone: you had every reason to assume she\u2019d speak Spanish.", "NTA, it's not your fault she decided to base her whole personal identity on hot air.", "NTA, nothing wrong with assuming if they spoke the language or not. Sometimes its an honest mistake and you just need apologize which you did and gave your reasoning. They decided their feelings were hurt because she is not what she portrait herself to be online and thought you called them out for it. Its not your fault that they decided to think that way.", "NTA - Carla's just hurt you exposed how fake she is. I mean she built her entire persona around her roots and she can't even introduce herself in the language. That's kinda sad.

If she was honest about everything I don't think they would have caused such a scene and overreact like that. She coule have easily explained after your introduction that she doesn't speak or forgot the language, no big deal.", "NTA. That reaction from someone whose Latina heritage is a personality trait is reminiscent of performative relation to their culture. \n\nIt is a safe assumption that someone, whose personality trait is being a certain ethnicity, would be able to speak the language in that culture. She can own up to it or continue blaming others for their inability to converse in Spanish.", "I go with NTA\n\nIt was a reasonable assumption, that she is fluent in spanish with the image she activly makes. Your appologie is completely sufficient in my eyes.", "NTA. You already apologised. It is silly for them to insist that now you apologise better. Also, she could have told you then that her Spanish is not strong and this entire situation could have been avoided.", "NTA.  This white american woman would have assumed she spoke Spanish 100%.

How do they clock themselves right away lol", "NTA\n\nIf someone makes a big deal about their Cuban ancestry, then the assumption is that they grew up speaking Spanish as a first language. By speaking Spanish to Carla you showed her up and embarrassed her. Your bf should have warned you.\n\nI think this goes on a lot in America.

I don\u2019t think you owe her an apology but you can send her a message with the explanation and say \u201cI\u2019m sorry you were upset but it is my language and wasn\u2019t intended to offend\u201d.

Either way: She did this to herself. You are not responsible for her feelings of inadequacy. If she feels she should be more fluent, she could certainly work on it. If she played up her fluency, it was either because of her feeling guilty for not being fluent or to make herself \"special\" out of feeling inaduquate. \n\nYou apologized for an honest mistake. She is upset, because nobody can repair her destroyed faulty self representation. \n\nEntiendo completamente el sentimiendo de verg\u00fcenza cuando se habla en otras lenguas.

Given the info you had to go by, there was no reason to suspect she might not speak Spanish.

But i truly cannot think of you as the asshole here.  I might suggest talking to some other family members, try to find out more about why she reacted that way... but then again, I personally would be a little afraid to do so, after getting a reaction like that.

You definitely don\u2019t owe anybody an apology.\n\nThat said, all the Carla hate in this comment section is pretty obnoxious. I live in Chicago, and I know a fair amount of children of immigrants whose Spanish speaking parents not only didn\u2019t want their kids to learn Spanish, they actively discouraged it. In my experience, this is fairly common among more conservative Latino families in the US. Many of these second generation Latino immigrants who don\u2019t know Spanish still grew up learning the culture of their heritage even though they never learned the language; many of them feel personally inadequate *specifically because* they don\u2019t speak Spanish. Again, OP did nothing wrong, but Carla isn\u2019t any less Latina for not speaking Spanish, and I find it startling how many people are chastising her love of her Cuban heritage as fake just because she doesn\u2019t speak Spanish.", "NTA.  This is stupid of them. You already apologized for assuming she spoke Spanish.  That should be the end of it.

You inadvertently outed and embarrassed her in front of everyone which is why she is pissed. This is not your fault. While the US is not the best place to learn foreign languages Spanish is the easiest one to find opportunities to learn and others to speak it with.

Never assume.", "NTA - I don't see any offense on Your part. Carla claimed to be it, but wasn't.", "NTA You exposed Miss Carla for not being as Cuban as she liked to present herself as.\n\nYou apologized though I don't see why you felt the need to even do that.", "I mean it's just really weird to start talking to someone in a different language than the rest of the people in the setting. \n\nWhy nor just ask before?", "NTA. It's kind of embarrassing for her that I, someone from a country where hardly anyone can speak Spanish who hasn't been to a Spanish speaking area since the age of 7, speak better Spanish than her, who claims to be from a Spanish-speaking culture, just because I learned some Spanish in secondary school.", "Mmm I'm going to go with a mild YTA, but in one of the most innocent ways possible. As a Asian-American, I was raised with a separation from my culture because my parents wanted to assimilate to the US so I only speak English. Because of that, I've always felt excluded from my heritage, and it seems like your SIL is going through something similar. I've had moments like your SIL where people of my culture come up to me speaking the native language, and then get offended when I tell them I don't understand or speak the language. If you haven't grown up in that kind of environment, it may be hard to understand why she feels so negatively.\n\nI'd say apologize again, emphasizing that you weren't trying to show off or be condescending, but that you were genuinely looking for a way to connect with her. If her heritage is that important to her, ask her questions about how she grew up, the role language played, and maybe if you become closer to her you can offer to let her practice her Spanish with you", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hearing a native spanish speaker likely just serves as a reinforcement of how distant Carla is from her Cuban roots that she obviously values. This isn't OP's fault and she's definitely NTA but saying that it's cause Carla lied about knowing spanish is just wrong.", "I have to disagree. It's entirely possible that Carla truly does embrace her heritage, but was never taught Spanish and is struggling to learn it despite wishing she was better at it. Given that this is America and an area with a small Latin community, it's entirely likely that people assume she must speak Spanish often and she feels shame every time she has to explain that she doesn't. I'm sure she's gotten things like \"If you're Cuban, why don't you speak Spanish\" and \"Oh so you're not really Cuban\" simply because she doesn't speak Spanish. \n\nThat type of trauma from having parts of your identity questioned and missing and picked apart both by peers and enemies alike tears people down and it's unfortunately very common in poc communities. \n\nIt likely has very little to do with how much she hyped up her Spanish Skills and everything to do with how that's consistently been a point of embarrassment and turmoil for her. \n\nAlso OP's apology wasn't really an apology. It comes off as invalidating part of Carla's identity because she doesn't speak Spanish. \"Sorry, I thought you would know this 'basic thing' because of who you claim to be\" isn't the same as \"I'm sorry I hurt you\".", ">NTA, it's not your fault she decided to base her whole personal identity on hot air.\n\nTHIS! This is what I think. She was making a big deal about how Cuban she was but she never even bothered to learn the language! (Which wouldn't be a big deal if she wasn't trying to pretend she *did* know the language\u2014which honestly is what happened here.) How embarrassing!", "So you can\u2019t identify strongly with your culture unless you know the \u201cnative\u201d language?

One guy would not shut up about it and then proceeded to not know what Wiener Schnitzel was and complain that we didn\u2019t have Budweiser on tap.  He kept saying \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of that and I\u2019m of German decent!\u201d, like that isn\u2019t super common here.  Lol.  \n\nAnyway, agree on NTA.

There are a lot of very proud Welshies out there who don\u2019t speak the language and would be absolutely insulted to be considered \u201cless Welsh\u201d because of it. \n\nObviously this was a sore point to SIL that OP was unaware of but there was no need to bring her social media into it, a simple \u201cIm sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to cause offence, I assumed\u201d would\u2019ve done.", "Is it? I had a Mexican assistant and once we had a Spanish visitor and they happily chatted away in Spanish for a minute or so and it was fun to see how much more animated she got while speaking Spanish instead of English or German.", "I get where you're coming from, but is your username/social media all about being Asian?

This seems more like a Cuban version of a weeaboo.", "The OP was pulled aside and was rudely confronted at first.

I lived in Miami for 2 years after college and before grad school. Everyone spoke Spanish there. It was super easy to pickup the language at a conversational level.

OP NTA, Carla - fake AH. She drank her own kool-aid and paid the price.", "Ok but like. Deciding someone's heritage isn't legit simply because their parents/family never taught them the language is pretty messed up and people who do this are probably why Carla had such a strong reaction to this.", "My family comes from England (we used to regularly get relatives visiting us from the UK) so if I want to, I can brag about being of British descent *and* I even speak the language, lol!", "LOL - I am of German descent, however, I also know about 10 words of the language and admit to it.

I know plenty of people who didn't get the opportunity to celebrate their heritage until they were older.

She could have just laughed and said, \" hey, I speak Spanish poorly, let's speak English (although clearly she doesn't speak it at all).

It's not like OP ran up to some random person on the street who looked Hispanic and tried to talk to them (and even then, tbh, I think it's a bit different when someone is a native in a language trying to find someone to speak to than someone learning and expecting that person to help them practice).", "Agreed.

To me, I feel like the OP was genuine in her apology because she assumed Carla knew Spanish from her social media posts and wanted Carla to feel more \"comfortable\" knowing they can converse in their \"mother tongue\".
