There really isn't much excuse for her to not learn if she was interested. Heck, Televisa/Univision has filmed some telenovelas in Miami.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you assumed based on her looks alone: you had every reason to assume she\u2019d speak Spanish.", "NTA, it's not your fault she decided to base her whole personal identity on hot air.", "NTA, nothing wrong with assuming if they spoke the language or not. Sometimes its an honest mistake and you just need apologize which you did and gave your reasoning. They decided their feelings were hurt because she is not what she portray herself to be online and thought you called them out for it. Its not your fault that they decided to think that way.", "NTA - Carla's just hurt you exposed how fake she is. I mean she built her entire persona around her roots and she can't even introduce herself in the language. That's kinda sad. But not your problem.", "NTA - Carla made a big deal about her heritage and doesn't understand half of it. As a non USA person, this seems to be esepcially prevalent in the US - \"Oh, I'm German, too\"  Speak German to them \"I don't speak the language\".", "NTA ... it wasn't really your fault that she seemingly isn't exactly how she portrayed herself to everyone. If she was honest about everything I don't think they would have caused such a scene and overreact like that. She coule have easily explained after your introduction that she doesn't speak or forgot the language, no big deal.", "NTA. That reaction from someone whose Latina heritage is a personality trait is reminiscent of performative relation to their culture. \n\nIt is a safe assumption that someone, whose personality trait is being a certain ethnicity, would be able to speak the language in that culture. She can own up to it or continue blaming others for their inability to converse in Spanish.", "I go with NTA\n\nIt was a reasonable assumption, that she is fluent in spanish with the image she activly makes. Your appologie is completely sufficient in my eyes.", "NTA. You already apologised. It is silly for them to insist that now you apologise better. Also, she could have told you then that her Spanish is not strong and this entire situation could have been avoided.", "NTA.  This white american woman would have assumed she spoke Spanish 100%.  She's made her Hilaria Baldwin persona out of a lie.", "As a Latina living in the US, I've come to assume that the hyper-Latino LARPers never speak Spanish. \n\nWhat I mean is, if I meet someone that looks similar to myself except they immediately make it a Big Deal that they're soooo Latinoooo, it's nearly inevitable that they only speak English. How do they clock themselves right away lol\n\nedit so the sensitive 2nd(+) generations don't get the wrong idea. Ofc it's not your fault no one taught you Spanish/insert language.

By speaking Spanish to Carla you showed her up and embarrassed her. Your bf should have warned you.\n\nI think this goes on a lot in America.

I don\u2019t think you owe her an apology but you can send her a message with the explanation and say \u201cI\u2019m sorry you were upset but it is my language and wasn\u2019t intended to offend\u201d.

Either way: She did this to herself. You are not responsible for her feelings of inadequacy. If she feels she should be more fluent, she could certainly work on it. If she played up her fluency, it was either because of her feeling guilty for not being fluent or to make herself \"special\" out of feeling inaduquate. \n\nYou apologized for an honest mistake.

But i truly cannot think of you as the asshole here.  I might suggest talking to some other family members, try to find out more about why she reacted that way... but then again, I personally would be a little afraid to do so, after getting a reaction like that.

You definitely don\u2019t owe anybody an apology.\n\nThat said, all the Carla hate in this comment section is pretty obnoxious. I live in Chicago, and I know a fair amount of children of immigrants whose Spanish speaking parents not only didn\u2019t want their kids to learn Spanish, they actively discouraged it. In my experience, this is fairly common among more conservative Latino families in the US. Many of these second generation Latino immigrants who don\u2019t know Spanish still grew up learning the culture of their heritage even though they never learned the language; many of them feel personally inadequate *specifically because* they don\u2019t speak Spanish.

This is stupid of them. You already apologized for assuming she spoke Spanish.  That should be the end of it. Anything more is just weird and makes it glaringly obvious how insecure and whiny she is.", "NTA. You didn't do it out of spite. Carla simply has linguistic insecurity", "NTA.

You inadvertently outed and embarrassed her in front of everyone which is why she is pissed. This is not your fault. While the US is not the best place to learn foreign languages Spanish is the easiest one to find opportunities to learn and others to speak it with.

Never assume.", "NTA - I don't see any offense on Your part. Carla claimed to be it, but wasn't.", "NTA You exposed Miss Carla for not being as Cuban as she liked to present herself as.\n\nYou apologized though I don't see why you felt the need to even do that.", "I mean it's just really weird to start talking to someone in a different language than the rest of the people in the setting. \n\nWhy nor just ask before?", "NTA. It's kind of embarrassing for her that I, someone from a country where hardly anyone can speak Spanish who hasn't been to a Spanish speaking area since the age of 7, speak better Spanish than her, who claims to be from a Spanish-speaking culture, just because I learned some Spanish in secondary school.", "Mmm I'm going to go with a mild YTA, but in one of the most innocent ways possible. As a Asian-American, I was raised with a separation from my culture because my parents wanted to assimilate to the US so I only speak English. Because of that, I've always felt excluded from my heritage, and it seems like your SIL is going through something similar. I've had moments like your SIL where people of my culture come up to me speaking the native language, and then get offended when I tell them I don't understand or speak the language. If you haven't grown up in that kind of environment, it may be hard to understand why she feels so negatively.\n\nI'd say apologize again, emphasizing that you weren't trying to show off or be condescending, but that you were genuinely looking for a way to connect with her. If her heritage is that important to her, ask her questions about how she grew up, the role language played, and maybe if you become closer to her you can offer to let her practice her Spanish with you", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's entirely possible that Carla truly does embrace her heritage, but was never taught Spanish and is struggling to learn it despite wishing she was better at it.

I'm sure she's gotten things like \"If you're Cuban, why don't you speak Spanish\" and \"Oh so you're not really Cuban\" simply because she doesn't speak Spanish. \n\nThat type of trauma from having parts of your identity questioned and missing and picked apart both by peers and enemies alike tears people down and it's unfortunately very common in poc communities. \n\nIt likely has very little to do with how much she hyped up her Spanish Skills and everything to do with how that's consistently been a point of embarrassment and turmoil for her. \n\nAlso OP's apology wasn't really an apology.

And I have become really sensitive (not emotionally, just in terms of awareness) of how people EXPECT me to be able to speak Chinese because of my ancestry, and how expectations of identity and language are really intertwined. I've seen this on social media too, it's really ingrained in popular imaginaries. And there's this notion that the less you speak X language, the less 'X' you are. And so nations of authenticity come into play. I have literally had people say \"wait, you can't already speak Chinese? That's so bad.\" Or \"you look oriental... Half Chinese? Then you must be able to speak Chinese and English, I assume. That's so great.\" And then I have to do the extra work to say \"no.\" And to be okay with that. While I am okay with it, I have also majored in race and identity studies so I find this whole topic fascinating. And I just see people who say this as conflating identity and language. \n\nSo this is a POSSIBLE explanation for Carla's reaction? To be fair I always still get nervous around native Chinese speakers! My Chinese is so so. And again,  notions if identity almost ALWAYS come up. So maybe for Carla it is more pronounced because her identity is so pronounced as latino. AND given she came from Miami where there was a bigger community, it's likely she encountered some small-minded people who have made comments like this that diminish her sense of claim to that identity. \n\nI wonder if you could ask to have s conversation with Carla (if at all) to address this.
