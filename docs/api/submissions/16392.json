Her wedding is on my birthday and since we would have to stay over at a hotel it would be going into Mother\u2019s Day (my mom died when I was 18 and i just don\u2019t like Mother\u2019s Day). I\u2019ve met her college friends a few times and they\u2019re OK but they don\u2019t really extend themselves or care to get to know me very well. I\u2019ve tried asking questions and being engaging but I can tell they\u2019d rather catch up amongst themselves than try to get to know me and that\u2019s no fault of them! I totally understand they want to catch up on old times and current events I don\u2019t hold it against them at all. Last wedding we went to all her college friends went off on their own and I was left with their boyfriends, they all ignored me and went off to do their own thing and I sat at the table by myself for over an hour. We make sacrifices for our partners and I\u2019m happy my fianc\u00e9 had a great time with her friends. We danced and it was fun when we were hanging out but I know she wants to catchup with her friends and I\u2019m cool with that. \n\nNow my Fiance doesn\u2019t really take \u201cno\u201d for an answer and for the past year we\u2019ve had this wedding invitation I\u2019ve maintained that I don\u2019t want to go, I don\u2019t know anybody and she should just catchup with her friends. She started crying and saying I never want to do anything and that she just wants to dance with me and we always have so much fun at weddings\u2026.etc. I said that\u2019s true but I really don\u2019t feel comfortable going. She did not accept that answer and I did not stick to my guns. Eventually I said fine I\u2019ll go. \n\nJust yesterday she tells me that we are sharing a room with her friend who has sleep apnea and snores like a dump truck going through a nitroglycerin factory. Also apparently on the return trip home we are taking her other friends to the airport which is almost two hours out of the way, turning a 1.5 hour ride home into a 4.5 hour ride. \n\nNone of this excites me or makes me want to go. I brought this up to my fianc\u00e9 and she got upset, asking why I didn\u2019t just say no to begin with. I told her I did say no and she said she thought I was just being difficult because I say no to most things, and I said that she badgered me and broke me down until I said yes because I knew she wouldn\u2019t drop it until I did. It\u2019s my fault for not sticking to my guns and I admit that. Now she\u2019s upset because I\u2019m being wishy washy and I\u2019m pissed because I have to spent my weekend off with a bunch of people who won\u2019t talk to me and after that go back to a room where I won\u2019t even get a good nights sleep. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 did give me an out but needs to know within a few hours. \n\nWIBTA if I cancel on my fianc\u00e9s friends wedding two weeks before even after RSVPing \u201cyes\u201d?\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSo we talked it out. She was receptive to me saying that she needs to accept no for an answer when I say no. I did say I felt bad for saying yes and being wishy washy. Eventually I told her I would go because I already said I would but we will leave after the wedding and not share a room with her friend nor drive her friends back to the airport the following morning. I looked up the venue and it\u2019s only about an hour away so it\u2019s not terrible. \n\nEveryone saying I should break off my engagement- we have a healthy relationship. This is one of the first big disagreements we have. Our communication is normally very healthy but I do need to put some boundaries up and I informed her of that.

Huge red flags. Also, @op NTA, I wouldn\u2019t go either ESPECIALLY with the room sharing situation and the 4.5 hour drive home. No thanks", "ESH. You should\u2019ve stood up for yourself and backed out before it got this close to the wedding. It\u2019s likely the bride and groom have already paid for your plate, and it isn\u2019t great that your gf will have to explain to her friends why you bailed last minute. Sucking it up and being there for your partner at events sometimes is also par for the course in a relationship, so it\u2019s a red flag that she\u2019s saying you \u201calways say no\u201d and that you have this averse a reaction to being expected to attend this wedding.\n\nBut, all that being said, she should never have steamrolled you into going\u2014even more so since it\u2019s your bday and you understandably have a tough time dealing with Mother\u2019s Day\u2014and should\u2019ve accepted your \u201cno\u201d from the outset and handled it accordingly. It\u2019s also IMO insane of her to expect you to share a room and drive 3+ hours without discussing those things with you prior to committing to them.\n\nIt sounds like your communication is really bad, and you guys definitely need to figure that out before you tie yourselves together in marriage.\n\nBottom line, yeah, it sucks to back out at this late stage. In your shoes, I\u2019d go to the wedding on the conditions that you get your own room and aren\u2019t expected to shuttle people to the airport.
