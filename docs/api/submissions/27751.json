A detail i can\u2019t leave out is that My sister(26) is wealthy. Not like a millionaire But she has a lot of money to spend and a lot of money saved.  I(24), am poor, not homeless, but Most goes to bills, rent, I\u2019m living in a trashy apartment, two jobs, you get it. \n\nSo I\u2019m buying her whatever she needs for the kid, when she needs more I get more, even taking care of her kid whenever she or her husband can\u2019t, and I really didn\u2019t have a problem with it. That was until a family get together, and she\u2019s showing off her babies expensive room (canopy crib, decked out in decorations and toys all that stuff) and once again, didn\u2019t pay much attention to it. Unfortunately I got a little alcohol in my system and asked about it. \u201c Hey why am I paying for baby essentials while your buying all this for her? \u201c, something like that, and she immediately gets defensive, saying stuff how she doesn\u2019t want her kid to have a boring \u201cbabyhood\u201d.\n I say the same thing again, \u201c Totally get it, but if you have money for all this technically unimportant stuff(the extreme amount of decorations) why am I paying for all this stuff \u201c, and we go back n fourth. I find the fact that she\u2019s buying all of this unnecessary stuff for a baby while I\u2019m stuck paying for things the kid actually needs, of course I want the kid to have toys, but everything else? \n\nShe leaves and everyones looking at me like I grew another head. I get whispers, nasty looks, my mother saying I\u2019m horrible for not wanting to help my sister(which isn\u2019t what I even said in our argument) and I just go. Of course we get over it not even 2 days later, I go back to buying stuff, watching her kid. Another thing, I have to take days off work for her kid, so not only am I not getting money from my jobs, I\u2019m not getting any type of money from her. So because of that, I have to work 2x more then what I did before, and rents close.\n\n I\u2019m watching her kid, she gets home, kids asleep. I say \u201c I can\u2019t do this anymore, I\u2019m stressed out with my jobs and rent is due soon, unless you can pay me some money back for all this, I can\u2019t do it. \u201c and bam, shit storm. I don\u2019t wanna get specific but the whole thing ends with her saying if i don\u2019t care about her kid i can leave, I love her lil baby, but I can\u2019t get evicted, so I left. It didn\u2019t even take 24hrs for me to get multiple texts, calls, all calling me names, saying I\u2019m a horrible sister. a week later and I\u2019m still getting sarcastic and rude messages from my sister.\nI\u2019m stressed out, and my brains in scrambles.

The sister is married. She had the baby. It's her responsibility. I thought this was some situation where the baby was in dire circumstances. I guess it must be so kind of cultural thing? In any case, I would be done, outside of bday presents and the like. As for babysitting, if you are not working and you want to, fine. Otherwise, no. NTA. Anyone who has an issue can take up your slack.", "You are NTA but you are a doormat. Giving to people who have more than you while you struggle is not an admirable trait. It's a low self esteem trait. Everyday you should practice in front of the mirror saying the word NO. Stop, I have made my decision and it is NO.\n\nDon't try to reason with people like her. They don't care about you. Only about how they can use you. Stop babysitting too. Love yourself more.\n\nfor all those people saying you are a bad sister: tell them you have to pay rent so how much money are they going to give you so you can help your sister? Nothing? the STFU thank you.", "NTA your sister sound like an entitled A to say the least!\n\nI'm honestly shocked that your family doesn't see this. Has your sister always been the Golden Child who can do no wrong?\n\nIt is absolutely disgusting of her and her husband to be financially abusing you like this.

Nothing in this whole story makes sense to me.  Maybe this is a cultural thing?  Even your parents are being jerks...WTF?!?", "just... stop doing it and don't let her guilt you into it again. anyone who thinks you'd be wrong is ridiculous. as soon as i read that your sister is wealthy, i asked the same question you asked her-- why are you paying for essentials? you should be able to spoil the kid every now and then with a little gift or something, not be burdened with the constant expense of diapers. NTA.", "NTA  There is no reason your sister and her husband cannot get the things needed for their baby themselves.  They can even have them delivered.  There is also no reason why you should feel like you have to purchase these things since they can afford it and you can't.  Stop buying the baby supplies.  Also you should stop having to give up your life to babysit.  They are using you and taking advantage.  It is time for you to say no and put your money towards your needs.  Next time they ask tell them that you will no longer be willing to buy this stuff.", "NTA.\n\nStop helping her. She's using you for free childcare and support.
