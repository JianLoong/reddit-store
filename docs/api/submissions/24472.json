At the beginning I felt a bit overwhelmed with their daily visits so I talked to my husband about it & now they come every 2/3 days. I understand the situation so I have to put up with that.\n\nMy FiL is married to a woman (my step-MiL) (my husbands actual mom is out of the picture). They\u2019ve been married for 15y, we get on well but she didn\u2019t raise my husband, he was 20y when they got married.\nMy step-MiL has a daughter (step-SiL) She doesn\u2019t live in our town & we don\u2019t see her much but she has never been very close to us.Sadly, she\u2019s been diagnosed with the C-illness & we\u2019ve become closer for support. As a result of the treatment, she cannot bear children.\nMy pregnancy happened at the same time of her treatment so my step-SiL was both happy & sad when we told her the news, & so was her mum. My step-SiL is nice to my baby, no problem with her.\n\nThe problem is my Step-MiL. I understand that even though not sharing blood, she will be a \u201cgranny figure\u201d for my baby as she\u2019s been a long time in the family, but I think she has crossed some lines not even my baby\u2019s actual grand\u2019s have\n.\nShe comes to my house without telling us before. Just rings the bell & \u201chere I am\u201d. She holds the baby every-single-time, even takes her from my arms! Cannot stop touching baby, she wanna be alone with her, follows me every time I change her diaper or clothes,everyday brings \u201cpresents from her friends\u201d & buys them herself, is jealous of my own friends when they come to spend time with us, if we go shopping or for a coffee with the baby says that she must look after her instead of taking her with us.\n\nMy step-MiL knows that my mum is having a hard time living so far away from us, and says hurtful things like \u201cthe baby recognises me, it\u2019s a pity she doesn\u2019t recognise you\u201d when they are together (which was not true as the baby was too little when this happened).\n \nBut yesterday she said something I cannot stop thinking about. Some friends where discussing who would the baby look after & they told my FiL that she has his eyes, and my step-MiL said \u201cI would like her to look like me,I wish she looked like me\u201d\nShe doesn\u2019t share a single gene with my daughter!\n\nI repeat, I understand that she is indeed a granny figure & I understand the pain my step-SiL is going through, but I think that some things she does are creepy. I don\u2019t want my child to be a compensation for her daughter\u2019s problem.\nI told my husband & he said \u201cshe was just happy to have a baby in the family\u201d.\nI feel like an AH for feeling this way. I even feel guilty for having the baby when her daughter can\u2019t or at the same time as she was under the treatment (we started trying for the baby before shit happened & never thought of stopping tbh).\nAm I the AH??", "created_utc": 1691832398, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15p0098/aita_for_not_trusting_my_stepmil/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She will NEVER normalize by herself, if ever, unless and until you and your husband put up very clear and big boundaries. They will NOT be allowed over unless you invite them, from now on. And that may be never. Or it may be once or twice a year. How close they live has no relevance. \n\nIt is inevitable that this woman will continue to escalate until you both say something to her. It will not be taken well, at least at first. But guess what? SO BE IT. It\u2019s inevitable anyway, so you may as well put up boundaries now before things get worse. Also, her dealing with her daughter\u2019s illness is no excuse for being overbearing to you and stressing you out, popping in and overstepping her boundaries. She doesn\u2019t get to hurt you just because she is hurting. Plus your SIL herself is not like this. \nJust keep her out of your lives for the near future. Save your sanity, knowing any stress you bear os picked up by your baby and it takes away from energy you need to care for the baby.", "NTA. Baby wear and stop opening the door for her or when you open the door say things likes \"thanks for waking the baby\" and don't let her in.\n\nAlso, FaceTime with your mom and the baby, put a picture of your mom in the baby's room so you can point out grandma to her.", "NTA but your step-MIL is. \n\nShe knows what she's doing and she knows she can get away with it. I mean, her own step son treats her like she's a meek angel. Her extremely rude comment to your mother says otherwise. \n\nYour husband needs to put down some clear boundaries with her. **You** are the child's mother and you shouldn't be made to feel so uncomfortable whilst also having decisions made for you.  She also shouldn't be able to turn up unannounced to your home whenever she feels like it. If this isn't nipped in the bud now, it never will be. \n\nAlso, her sadness is **not** your responsibility. Sorry to put it so bluntly. If she really wants to control you and your child, she can go and get a child of her own. Let her adopt one. Then she can do whatever she wants. In both instances, neither child will share her blood. \n\nYou're definitely NTA.", "NTA. She sounds awful.", "how about she stop showing up at your house evey 2-3 days to grab your child out of your arms and make disturbing comments and spend some with her daughter. this is not a situation you just have to \u201cput up\u201d with. you\u2019re not available for visits this often. if hubby disagrees, great. they\u2019re his guests. you and baby will be elsewhere, or resting. stepmil does not get to hold the baby without asking, that is for grandmas who behave like normal people and don\u2019t grab babies out of their mother\u2019s arms. nta, i say again, if stepsil\u2019s situation is so hard on stepmil she should go be with her daughter. your baby is not a replacement.", "You're NTA.

She is also trying to gatekeep being the granny. Her weird possessiveness of your child is alarming.

Definitely have your husband talk with his father. She shouldn\u2019t be coming over without calling and asking if it\u2019s a good time for you. Your daughter is only 2 months old and you and your husband are just adjusting to being parents. I wouldn\u2019t let anyone come that frequently and if they did most of the time should be to help you ( maybe picking up, helping with a meal, even letting you rest or take a shower while watching your daughter for a bit). I suggest immediately putting an end to allowing her to take your daughter out of your arms. Speak up and say NO. You\u2019re right her actions are a bit creepy.", "NTA. You have  to establish boundaries. Tell her what days and times she may come over. Do not give her a key. Do not open the door to her other than at the established times.

This is pretty typical behavior for brand new grandparents (or step-grandparents).    \nYour stepMIL looks at the baby as a real grandkid. Sure, she might have said that \"I wish she looked like me\" without thinking. It happens.  She's excited for a baby.  It's sad that your SIL can't have kids, but perhaps she can enjoy being an auntie to the baby. Don't feel guilty for having your daugher while your SIL was undergoing treatment.  Life happens to everyone all at the same time.  \nNow, I was going to say \"no a h\" until I saw that your MIL sniping at your mom. I guess that would be all in the delivery of that line \"the baby recognises me, it\u2019s a pity she doesn\u2019t recognise you\".  \n\n\nJust hang in there, enjoy that baby, sniff her head, and NTA.", "NAH. You need your boundaries respected and your step-MiL is trying to cope with the fact that she'll never have grandkids who share her genes.
