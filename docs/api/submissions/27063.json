The situation is a bit complex. Mom wanted to go on exotic vacation last summer. Then she finds out my younger brother has a debt with state and until that\u2019s payed off she can\u2019t go (theoretically she was paying for the vacation with money from car sale but found out she can\u2019t go trough with the sale because brother created a debt on that car). Now brother couldn\u2019t care less about the debt. But my mom was really looking forward to that vacation.\n\nShe\u2019s a successful business owner. Comes to me saying she can\u2019t cover both the debt and vacation now. I know it\u2019s her dream vacation. I say I could cover the debt with my savings and she can go trough with the sale and get the vacation with her boyfriend. But these savings are for my masters degree tuition and uni expenses. She says it\u2019s fine, she has good income and can\u2019t return the money in two three months top. \n\nWell that was year and couple months ago. She still owes me money. I told her I had to go in debt over the year because I missed money for school. Told her I really need the money because if I pay for next year of school I\u2019ll be completely broke and won\u2019t be able to buy food. She went to 3 or 4 vacations since last year. Spent New Year\u2019s Eve celebrating in Greece on some island. Paid for her boyfriends sister\u2019s vacation etc. She\u2019s definitely not broke. She just doesn\u2019t care. \n\nNow she\u2019s claiming that since it was my brothers debt, it\u2019s not her problem and he should be the one paying me back. Well back  then I told her I\u2019m only gonna cover the debt because of her vacation and we all agreed she\u2019s the one paying me back. She told my brother that she feels like she has nothing to apologize for and we went no contact like a month ago.\n\nAnd next month she\u2019s celebrating 50th birthday. And texted me asking if I\u2019m coming. I love her and care about her but I don\u2019t feel like pretending I\u2019m okay with how they used me. So AITA for not going to the birthday party unless she at least she says sorry for using me like this? \n\nTLDR: AITA for refusing to go to my mom\u2019s 50th bday party because she borrowed my school tuition money and left me broke and doesn\u2019t feel like she has anything to apologize for?", "created_utc": 1694954833, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16kzt2n/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_moms_50th_birthday/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
