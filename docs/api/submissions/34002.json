She didn't respond at all or ask you how you were doing but she expects you to know she's worrying?\n\nThat's odd enough on it's own but easily chalked to miscommunication. But if she *keeps* bringing this up that's even more odd and speaks to some other concern she has but isn't able to express.", "Does your spouse know phones work two ways? NTA.", "NTA. \nIf I was worried about my spouse, the first thing I would do is text/call them. There\u2019s no way that she was that worried if she didn\u2019t attempt to contact you. Plus you messaged last, so ball was definitely in her court to message back. And then to keep bringing it up weeks later is just unhealthy.", "You both seem insufferable", "NTA. IMO she\u2019s giving you shizz for going away without her. She\u2019s jealous her significantly younger (and possibly perceived as \u2018hotter\u2019) wife went away without her and instead of talking to you like the adult she\u2019s been for as long as you\u2019ve been alive, she\u2019s making you feel bad in such a manner it\u2019ll make you rethink taking a trip without her.", "NTA. It makes no sense that she would feel that way while NOT sending you any kind of message. She\u2019s being completely unreasonable and passive aggressive.", "NTA, if she was really that worried wouldn't she have...sent you a single message?", "That\u2019s a very unusual reaction for someone who has not messaged you for like 2 days. Either she\u2019s just being a hypocrite or perhaps some messages failed to actually go through(either hers or yours).", "Wifi is a thing in Mexico and you could have used a messenger app to communicate with her.   NTA but you\u2019re both being obtuse", "INFO: I\u2019m so confused. How is she mad at you when she didn\u2019t text you either? Did she explain her reasoning?", "NTA but sounds like perhaps we\u2019re missing some context here? I\u2019m assuming her feelings are hurt about not being invited on the trip or something related to that. This sounds like a couple who\u2019s dating and figuring out communication styles, not an older married couple. Sounds like you need to have a sit down convo when you\u2019re back!", "the age gap is insane, but nta.", "NTA. Reading your answers in the comment, that doesn't make any sense. If she was really worried, meaning that she was imagining that something did happen to you, she would not have be afraid of \"bothering\" you. \n\nIt look like a power trip to guilt you. \n\nWas it the first time you went on that kind of family holidays ?", "This relationship sounds toxic. ESH.\n\nIt would be a huge issue for me if my partner didn't text me for that long while away on a trip without me while texting was in fact possible.\n\nBut a) my partner would never, and b) I would never blank her in reply.\n\nWeird how often it's the multi decade age gaps that feature people who still act like petulant teenagers.", "YTA", "I feel like I just would have texted if I were that worried, so I guess I\u2019ll go with NTA \u2014 because she could have also texted you first but didn\u2019t, is the thing. \n\nIf she keeps bringing it up, there\u2019s probably something more that needs to be discussed here. She either needs to say what she\u2019s actually upset about or drop it.", "I could be wrong but you tried twice to text her and she never answered but she was worried and couldn't sleep. Which to me could have been easily fixed responding to one of your messages. It sounds like a lie to make you feel bad and I suspect that she was doing something else for her not to text you back. And trying to cover it up by being fake upset. Anyway nta and I would be looking out for more mind games in the past and future. Idk it all seems fishy to me", "I would throw it right back at her: respond with how hurt you were that she didn't text you in X hours, despite you texting her - if she didn't care to text you in that amount of time, she has absolutely NO room to kvetch at you for not texting her in a shorter time span. After that, every time she says something about 36 hours, mention the number of hours from the last text you received from her.", "ESH.  \n\nSo what I'm gathering from your post is that you didn't let your wife know that you got to Mexico safely and waited a day and a half before texting?  That makes you the a-hole BUT your wife not bothering to text either and trying to power guilt you after you texted is both manipulative and weird AF too.  That makes her the a-hole.", "Shes getting mad at you for not responding to her lack of response?\n\nLol.", "Potentially your goodnight message didn't go through?\n\nFailing that though, NTA, text tennis rules that the ball was in her court to reply to you!\n\nYou're on holiday, she's not, if she's not replying to you she can't get annoyed that you're not messaging her multiple times without reply.", "NTA. If she didn\u2019t respond, she can\u2019t complain. And anyone should be allowed real time away, with family, not worrying about what\u2019s going on at home if not given a reason to be concerned. Feels like she didn\u2019t actually support your going on the trip \u2026 you\u2019ll need to talk about why.", "ESH. This seems so bizarre to me. A family vacation amongst adults where no one brings their spouse is already odd. And then seemingly playing a game of chicken where you don\u2019t contact one another for over a day, while you are in a foreign country? Something sounds pretty unhealthy here", "NTA. You texted, she did not. Based on her reaction, it sounds like she's trying to gaslight you.", "NTA and this behavior + age gap is worrisome.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Lady needs to grow tf up.", "Well, if you know, you know ;) \n\nWhy is she guilt tripping you, you may know also. But I reckon it has little to do with the frequency of your message.\n\nAnyway, a message is not a call, and with all the notifications we get nowadays, a simple message is not a disturbance. If she was really getting worried, or more likely annoyed/pissed/jealous at the thought of you getting such a good time that you were not sharing your every move with her, she should have texted and say so.\n\nThe silent treatment/the ongoing ressentment is immature and a kind of manipulation.", "Yeah. I mean, I\u2019m a stage ten clinger so I get why staying in touch feels important.

That part makes no sense to me.\n\nIt feels like she\u2019s being passive aggressive and waiting for you to guess why she\u2019s hurt because she keeps re-initiating the conversation, but that won\u2019t solve anything.", "I'm confused by the timeline.
