NTA.", "NTA. \nIf I was worried about my spouse, the first thing I would do is text/call them. There\u2019s no way that she was that worried if she didn\u2019t attempt to contact you. Plus you messaged last, so ball was definitely in her court to message back. And then to keep bringing it up weeks later is just unhealthy.", "You both seem insufferable", "NTA. IMO she\u2019s giving you shizz for going away without her. She\u2019s jealous her significantly younger (and possibly perceived as \u2018hotter\u2019) wife went away without her and instead of talking to you like the adult she\u2019s been for as long as you\u2019ve been alive, she\u2019s making you feel bad in such a manner it\u2019ll make you rethink taking a trip without her.", "NTA.

She\u2019s being completely unreasonable and passive aggressive.", "NTA, if she was really that worried wouldn't she have...sent you a single message?", "That\u2019s a very unusual reaction for someone who has not messaged you for like 2 days.

Did she explain her reasoning?", "NTA but sounds like perhaps we\u2019re missing some context here? I\u2019m assuming her feelings are hurt about not being invited on the trip or something related to that.

Which to me could have been easily fixed responding to one of your messages. It sounds like a lie to make you feel bad and I suspect that she was doing something else for her not to text you back. And trying to cover it up by being fake upset. Anyway nta and I would be looking out for more mind games in the past and future. Idk it all seems fishy to me", "I would throw it right back at her: respond with how hurt you were that she didn't text you in X hours, despite you texting her - if she didn't care to text you in that amount of time, she has absolutely NO room to kvetch at you for not texting her in a shorter time span. After that, every time she says something about 36 hours, mention the number of hours from the last text you received from her.", "ESH.  \n\nSo what I'm gathering from your post is that you didn't let your wife know that you got to Mexico safely and waited a day and a half before texting?  That makes you the a-hole BUT your wife not bothering to text either and trying to power guilt you after you texted is both manipulative and weird AF too.

If she didn\u2019t respond, she can\u2019t complain. And anyone should be allowed real time away, with family, not worrying about what\u2019s going on at home if not given a reason to be concerned.

A family vacation amongst adults where no one brings their spouse is already odd. And then seemingly playing a game of chicken where you don\u2019t contact one another for over a day, while you are in a foreign country? Something sounds pretty unhealthy here", "NTA.

But I reckon it has little to do with the frequency of your message.\n\nAnyway, a message is not a call, and with all the notifications we get nowadays, a simple message is not a disturbance. If she was really getting worried, or more likely annoyed/pissed/jealous at the thought of you getting such a good time that you were not sharing your every move with her, she should have texted and say so.\n\nThe silent treatment/the ongoing ressentment is immature and a kind of manipulation.", "Yeah.

Obviously her shit with the phone was a passive aggressive move, but cmon, \"it was a family trip so nobody invited my spouse?\" Sis, your spouse is your immediate family.

You accidentally replied with your real account.     \n\nSo you've been with this woman for 10 years? When you were 22 and she was 41? That's not a great age gap, and she sounds possessive.

This is just such a fucking straight couple that doesn't even like their partner thing to do that my brain self-corrected lol.", "This is manipulative bullshit, and you should reject it. How can she be worried about you if she never reached out and didn\u2019t get a response?", "I think OP means they had arrived in Mexico a few days earlier and had been texting as normal in the first few days. Then one night during the week, the wife didn\u2019t respond to the good night text, OP had a busy day the next day and didn\u2019t text the wife, then texted the following morning (32 hours after the good night text).", "But usually when people do it, it's because one spouse said \"I don't really want to do that,\" not that they didn't get invited on the trip.

Best case she's insecure, but it's possible that she actively looked for a younger partner that she could control.", "Yeah this is way too far and controlling. You\u2019re away with family and you sent several messages with no response. Maybe there\u2019s something there because you are a gay couple, so she figured as a female she\u2019d also be invited and *maybe* felt snubbed? But no other spouses were invited like you said, so that\u2019s not really a fair thing to be upset over, if anything it actually is fair, was a family trip and gift from your dad. If roles were reversed how would you approach? That\u2019s usually how I go about assessing. My vote is definitely NTA", "Holy cow thank you for this. My mom has used this with me and my immediate family members forever and this was very enlightening. \n\nShe would give me and my sister the silent treatment for months at a time when we were KIDS. Can you imagine ignoring your child for a month? Christ.\n\nOh, and also, NTA, OP."]}
