Allowing children to explore all aspects of self expression in a supportive environment builds self esteem which reduces the likelihood of bullying. It also gives you an opportunity to help them process any negative comments they might receive and learn that other people may have messed up views that they need to learn to deal with. \n\nMost kids won't say anything negative. Those that do have been exposed to toxic masculinity and this gives you an opportunity to name that and explain that nail polish is for everyone, but some people have funny ideas about what it means to be a boy or girl. \n\nYour husband is essentially saying that he would prefer to be their bully in a misguided attempt to stop others from bullying them, instead of teaching them how to handle other people without compromising yourself. He's got some work to do on his own toxic masculinity and that's worth addressing cause this will keep coming up across a wide range of issues in the future. The Will To Change by bell hooks is an excellent book on this topic, for both of you.", "It\u2019s becoming more and more common nowadays, and so much the better.

Depending on your location, this could be problematic or even violent.\n\nOtherwise, explain to them the nature of cosmetics.  Some persons use them to correct natural flaws.  Others use them to enhance appearance to find a mate.   None of this is natural, but it is totally harmless and generally accepted throughout history.  \\[See: ancient Rome-- where men wore more elaborate makeup than women.\\]\n\n Modern sensibilities tend to ignore the past, but maybe ignore all that and ask your kids if they feel okay about their natural selves before they want to change anything.  Also, make sure they don't bite their nails.", "NTA I think boys should be allowed nail polish if they are interested. My son usually wants his toe nails done whenever I do his younger sisters\u2019.

Kids nowadays seriously don't care, and like you said they're curious! It's important to let kids explore their likes and interests. If there's kids in their class/at their school bullying them for it then thats when you get faculty involved and solve the bullying problem. \n\nGenerally though kids nowadays don't care. My 4 y/o autistic brother does have concepts of girl/boy things but he'd wear his tutu and play with his cabbage patch dolls because we live in a generation now where McDonalds doesn't have girl and boy toys, kids can freely explore their interests without being bound to the social construct of gender and gendered things. \n\nMy dad is a lot like your husband, he has this mindset that girly things shouldn't be worn by guys (especially makeup/nail polish). Does this stop my 4 y/o brother from doing my mum's makeup and her hair? Hell no! Explain to your husband that if they get bullied, that's life and that it's not that hard to conclude. If your kid wants to stop, then that's his choice.", "NAH. It\u2019s not a big deal to let kids wear nail polish, and these days I see plenty of boys/men/male presenting people wearing nail polish. However, when I was growing up (not all that long ago) a boy would have definitely gotten bullied and beat up for it. Your husband is reacting based on his own experiences, and just wants to protect them. Younger generations seem to be generally more accepting of differences, and bullying doesn\u2019t seem to be the cool thing to do anymore, so I think it\u2019s really just a generational difference.", "This right here!! 100%", "plus they\u2019re 6, maybe help clean up on their skin but they can wear it.

I know a lot of girls and women that don\u2019t wear it and some boys and even men that do wear it. Some guys get manicures and wear clear polish. My friend in grad school wore black nail polish (he wasn\u2019t goth or anything\u2014he just liked it.) Harry styles wears it. It\u2019s 2023.
