They do what makes them happy and if anyone has a problem with that you tell them to shut up.", "YTA- they are boys not girls", "If it\u2019s good enough for David Beckham, it\u2019s good enough for your kids.   \n\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Our boys love wearing nail polish.\n\nYour husband should join in and help paint their nails or get his own painted. He should support and encourage them to be themselves.", "NAH you are comfortable with it but your husband isn\u2019t so a talk between you two might be good.", "NTA men only behave like this for one of two reasons:\n\n1. They either wanted to or never felt they could do that sort of thing because they\u2019re \u2018men\u2019 and this is seen as a feminine thing, either way it reeks of insecurity and gender stereotypes.\n\n2. They use to be the person who picked on children who engaged in things like this so they can\u2019t possibly have children who do that now. \n\nEither way, this is a him problem, not a you or your children problem. Let them express themselves, they\u2019re not hurting anyone other than your husbands ego.", "NTA this is how you normalize things", "NAH. He might be right, or would have been right once upon a time. Still, either their peers will be chill with it, or they'll say something mean and your kids may take it to heart and stop on their own.", "Husband needs to chill. Nothing wrong with any of this as long as the kids are wilfully aware and okay.", "6? He's probably gonna be fine and might start a trend.  NTA, husband needs to watch that razor commercial and address his own poor confidence.", "Let us know how school went! Neither of you are the AH. I wouldn\u2019t let my kids go to school with it on, their school has a no polish, hair colour or jewellery policy. I would also fear them being laughed at and it all ending in tears so I would not take that risk, bit of fun on the weekend and taken off Sunday night there\u2019s not much harm in that and they still get to be creative.", "As a 28M who found a love for using nail varnish via cosplay in his 20s, you rock NTA. Let them have fun", "My youngest boy likes a purple and yellow combo for a retro Batman style.... Though sometimes we add a little sparkle, because everything is better with sparkles!", "Counterpoint, bullys operate on insecurity and unhappiness, they will bully people for any reason.\n\nIf the nail polish attracts comments it will give the kids valuable experience in dealing with this and how they feel about it.", "Yes, people get bullied for how they\u2019re dressed, but does that mean you shouldn\u2019t dress however you want? No it doesn\u2019t. Why not go after the bullies instead of going after the victims? \n\nWe should **not** teach kids that they can\u2019t dress certain ways because society thinks it\u2019s wrong. We should teach kids to be proud of themselves and don\u2019t let the words of insecure people get to them. And, a lot more people today is okay with \u201cdifferent\u201d clothes. \n\nWhat you\u2019re saying is the same as when people tell women not to dress certain ways because they will get r*ped and then it\u2019s their own fault because they were \u201cbegging\u201d for it.", "NTA my 4 year old son also wears nail polish occasionally. Nails are my hobby and my daughter (his older sister) is also into them. My son doesn\u2019t get made fun of at preschool, he shows them off proudly and his friends and teachers all encourage him. Yes people are gonna judge and tell you something, my parents and aunts and uncles definitely have, but at the end of the day my son is safe and happy.", "If they get picked on for it, than they will learn shame.  It\u2019s sucks but that is life.  Protecting your kids from everything doesn\u2019t help them, it erodes their coping skills.   Much of world is lining up to teach kids that they should hate/shame things that are different.  They shouldn\u2019t learn that at home.", "NTA at all. My son (now 8) asked to wear nail polish when his mom was doing her nails (she only does them once in a while for fun) and so we all had them done to make sure he knew it was okay. He asked to wear makeup last year, so we ordered him a few different things to try. He\u2019s a kid. Kids need to find themselves. The most important thing is that we support our children and make sure they\u2019re happy. Nail polish and makeup aren\u2019t going to do any harm at all. Thinking their parents don\u2019t support them will. I know your child is going and just playing. But telling a child \u201cno you can\u2019t play. You\u2019re abnormal for wanting to play like that\u201d will damage them.", "Nah. NTA. I get where your husband is coming from and agree to a certain extent, but at the same time if this is the kids decision, ain\u2019t no harm or foul. They can explore this, ain\u2019t hurting anybody.", "NTA Kids should be able to explore and play\n\nBut why do I feel like you should get a nail stamping kit and stamp something \"manly\" on the thumb like maybe a snake or flames......then show the kids a bunch of different options and do the rest of the fingers with whatever they want \ud83d\ude02 I know their nails are probably too small tho XD", "YTA.  How bout dressing your kids in clown suits?  Impact will be the same.  Your kids have an entire lifetime too make such decisions.  What you want to do will mark affect them for a long time. Is finger nail polish a big deal?  No, but six year olds are not the right vehicle for calling it to society's attention.", "NTA in the slightest. If your kids ever feel sad or picked on, show them photos of 90% of 80s and 90s bands. It's been cool for years and your husband needs to accept that.", "It's 2023, men & boys wear nail polish now and look amazing, your husband is weird. NTA.", "NTA\n\nSolve the bully problem, don't conform to it.", "Never be your children\u2019s first bully. NTA. My mother, father and older brother forbid me from doing feminine things my entire childhood. They policed how I walked and talked and even how much I let my ARMS swing when I walked. They made me so self conscious and insecure about who I am that I am still, at 39, unpacking their toxic lessons.\n\nThey did it out of love, mostly, because I was obviously different and they wanted me to fit in, but it still didn\u2019t stop me from being Different, I was still picked on by kids at school, AND I was miserable because the little automaton they tried to make me be wasn\u2019t me anyway. If I was going to be picked on they should have just let me be.\n\nLet your kids wear nail polish. If they\u2019re bullied, it\u2019s because the kids were probably going to bully them anyway.", "NTA. Makeup and beauty stuff is for everyone. Help them find themselves, explore. Who knows? Maybe they won't like it after a week. Kids are changeable and easily distracted. Or maybe a kid in their class seeing them with their polish will inspire them to do the same! Anything is possible if you keep an open mind.", "NTA. However, I would have slightly warned my sons that other kids might not appreciate it due to their beliefs. I understand where your husband is coming from in the bullying aspect, because kids can be cruel, however I\u2019d still let them wear it", "NTA. If they get picked on at school, and want the nail polish removed, you can remove it. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re letting them go rogue with a tattoo gun.\n\nNail polish is a great way to express individuality, which is especially important for twins. If they are identical, nail polish can help the other 6 year olds tell them apart at school.", "My four year old like lipstick because I put it on. Your husband has to let your kids be who they are (oh and nail polish won't make them gay, bi, trans or anything else so tell your husband i said so). They're kids and they'll be whoever they'll be (in terms of identity and sexuality). Let them be kids for now.", "NTA. \n\nMy son regularly asks to wear headbands or hair clips when we leave the house and I let him.\n\nYour job is to protect them, but that doesn't mean to wrap them up and hide them in conformity. \nYou teach them to be confident, assertive young people and to stand up to people who would put them down", "I\u2019m glad to read your comment. Boys should be allowed to play with color also! \n\nI would tell the husband - MEN are the designers and testers and creators to some of these nail polish lines. Men in fashion, men in the arts. What\u2019s wrong with some long lasting colorful paint? Maybe it will help the boys creative side", "Kids will find something to pick at and make fun of no matter what. If not this then something else. If it\u2019s something you control, maybe it\u2019s better.", "I do union factory work and wear all sorts of colorful nail polish, my favorite is this black base with rainbow glitter in it. Only one really old guy (thinks like OP's DH) has even ribbed me for it.", "Wdym? She\u2019s not \u201cpushing\u201d into the kids, the kids asked for nail polish", "Because it is weird", "Embrace it! My husband comes to get fancy manicures with me every so often and loves it.", "Interesting, you claim 80% in another comment. Its almost as is you're just making this up out of your own ideas about gender appropriateness ...", "That\u2019s amazing!", "In your head", "It's really not", "Bullied in 80% of societies is a pretty massive assertion, got anything to prove that?", "To paraphrase Office Space- why should Op and their kids change when the bullies are the ones that suck?  You don't seem to think it's right to bully kids over nail polish.  So why not let kids do what they want as long as it's not bad, and handle the bad behavior as it happens?\n\nI've been bullied as an adult male for wearing nail polish, by strangers and coworkers.  It's annoying but you just tell them to fuck off essentially and move on.  How to deal with bullies is an important life lesson as well.", "\"set them up to be bullied\" is plain obvious victim blaming"]}
