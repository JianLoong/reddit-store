I (24F) have a birthday that falls on Christmas \u2014 every single year, as that\u2019s how it works. Apparently, this is a big, big issue with my brother (27M). \n\nWhen I was in little, my parents established that I would open my birthday gifts on Christmas \u2014 on my birthday \u2014 either before or after the Christmas gifts. They didn\u2019t want me to feel lesser and miss out on a birthday present by combining it with a Christmas present. I\u2019ve always appreciated that. The few times that it has been combined was by my request \u2014 they helped me buy a used car when I turned 19 as my present, then they paid for a trip once I graduated college. \n\nAnyways, we\u2019ve begun discussing holiday plans. My brother let us know that he planned on bringing his girlfriend (29F) so that my parents could purchase his plane tickets. After that, we started a new group chat to include her in our planning \u2014 my parents organize a Santa lunch and we usually go to a light show or caroling. My mom asked me if I wanted to open my birthday gifts at the beginning of the day or the end. I told her I didn\u2019t care. The chats and scheduling continued seemingly without issue. \n\nThen two or three days later, my brother asked me if we could do my birthday presents another time. Apparently, his girlfriend doesn\u2019t want to buy me a birthday gift AND Christmas gift \u2014 I was kind of wishy-washy about it. I didn\u2019t want to open them on a different day, but I told him that all she needed to do was sign her name on whatever he got me and that\u2019d be fine. She doesn\u2019t need to get me anything at all. He says that\u2019s not an option to her? She\u2019s freaking out and saying she won\u2019t come now. \n\nMy brother texted the chat and said I was making myself the star of the show on my birthday like always. He said that I refused to move my birthday (lol) and was making his girlfriend feel unwelcome. When dad stepped in and said I was allowed to enjoy my birthday on my birthday, that he and mom wanted me to celebrate then, my brother said he wasn\u2019t coming at all now. \n\nI talked to my parents separately and said we could change the day. I didn\u2019t care that much if it meant that Jack wouldn\u2019t come. They refused, saying it was the principle, but dad also let me know that my present is actually something to be done on my birthday/Christmas too. When my brother asked me \u201cto change my birthday\u201d again, this time I said no because I knew that there were plans involved. \n\nMy brother\u2019s girlfriend is now calling me a birthday grinch to anyone who will listen. \n\nAITA for being born on Christmas?\n\n\nETA: I texted the group chat suggesting I\u2019d time travel to change my birthday or maybe Jesus\u2019 to try to lighten the mood\u2026.. it didn\u2019t go over well with my brother and his gf \n\n\nETA pt. 2 electric boogaloo: Okay, I ruined Christmas. Apparently, they were going to announce they\u2019re expecting and didn\u2019t want to take away from me and make me share my birthday with another (lol) big event. I feel awful. They\u2019re still not coming to Christmas. \n\n\nETA (pulled from comment): The group chat is popping off and now nothing is a surprise.\n\nApparently, Christmas is her favorite holiday. She was going to give us all presents that would have hints for a scavenger hunt about her being pregnant (very much in the vein of something my mom and I would enjoy doing, and my dad would go along for the ride). She was wanting to do my birthday on another day to give her the time to do that instead of birthday presents/cake.\n\nThat said, my parents purchased tickets to a few events for me for my birthday to be attended on Christmas. A winter lights tour and a ugly sweater bar crawl. Obviously, the latter is a slight to her. But that\u2019s why they were insisting my birthday had to happen on my birthday. Yes, it\u2019s all Christmas-themed, but I\u2019ve embraced it now.", "created_utc": 1700574719, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180hgkt/aita_for_being_born_on_christmas/", "score": 277, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Christmas has been a long time, I'd think it would be appropriate for you to have scheduled your birth at a more convenient time. Maybe even wait until January? But Nooooooooooo - you had to choose Christmas. Well, I hope you're satisfied.\n\nOr maybe, without the sarcasm:\n\nWTF is wrong with your brother and his girlfriend? All you seem to be interested in from her would be a \"Happy Birthday\", which isn't exactly asking for a lot. Your brother is a raging AH here.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Obviously.\n\nI get your brother being weird/jealous about this when you were kids - Christmas means so much to young children and I can see how, say, a 6 year old would struggle to process the feeling that the day is being made less special by the partial focus on their younger sibling.  A child of that age would also struggle to understand the trade-off (that they get a separate birthday all to themself as well as Christmas, while the sibling only really gets one day).\n\nFor a child, it\u2019s understandable.  For a grown man in his late 20s it\u2019s frankly embarrassing.  Your brother seems to be deeply lacking in maturity when it comes to this issue, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just Christmas/birthday stuff that sets off his inner toddler or if he\u2019s like that in his everyday life, but he is for sure the A for getting this upset and blowing up family gatherings over a perfectly reasonable, long-standing compromise to account for your date of birth.", "lol NTA\n\nI can\u2019t imagine having the gall to demand that someone else\u2019s family member change or not celebrate their own birthday with their family because I both 1) refuse to get them a gift, and 2) refuse to NOT get them a gift. Truly can\u2019t fathom thinking I had any right to make such a request. \n\nIt sounds like she doesn\u2019t want to actually get you a gift, but she also doesn\u2019t want the APPEARANCE of not getting you a gift. So if you just agree to celebrate your birthday on another day, when she isn\u2019t there, she can somehow maintain the illusion that she may have gotten you a birthday gift, had she been there. It\u2019s Schrodinger\u2019s Birthday Gift. Your brother\u2019s girlfriend is a dolt and an AH, and if she does come for Christmas I don\u2019t imagine she will make it to the next one. \n\nNTA, enjoy your birthday.", "First off, NTA. At all.\n\nSecond, I\u2019ve come here after your 2 edits, and despite that, your brother and his gf are still TAs. They didn\u2019t want you to share your attention, but still chose your BIRTHDAY/CHRISTMAS as the day to reveal their news, and had the gall to ask you to change your birthday, when they, much more easily, could have chosen literally ANY other day (including the 24th or the 26th) to share their news if they were actually so concerned about your limelight. \n\nOP, you didn\u2019t ruin Christmas, they, or more specifically, your brother did. I genuinely hope there isn\u2019t much more to it, but the cynical part of me thinks that your brother has been jealous of all the extra attention you always get on Christmas (without taking into account the special attention he gets on his birthday), and wanted it all for himself this one year. \n\nNone of this is your fault, and I am so happy that your parents are sticking to their guns of celebrating you on your own day. Please don\u2019t feel bad about it. If there has to be an asshole, then it\u2019s your brother.", "NTA but your brother and his girlfriend are INSANE.  So, don't buy you a separate gift.  Yeah, okay, maybe that isn't ideal for you, but then don't do it.  To throw the damn fit about \"Now I am not coming!\" is childish.  I HATED having my birthday close to Christmas, because I got so many combined gifts, it was never that special, it was always cold... I just HATED it.  My sister (summer baby) got separate gifts, special times, everything, and while her birthday wasn't any more celebrated, it just felt special because she got another one later in the year.

You brother and his girlfriend sound like miserable people who deserve each other.", "Scrolling through the comments revealed that this would have been the 3rd time the GF would be meeting OP... like how the heck did the brother at no point let it be known to his  GF about the situation?\n\nLike, where was the \"Oh, by the way, OP's birthday is on Christmas day and she gets separate birthday and Christmas present.

Your parents are right to set this boundary now - just in case this girl winds up sticking around", "NTA, even with the second edit.  She's pregnant.  Great!  They could announce it any time other than Christmas itself.  I imagine you wouldn't have minded sharing your birthday with that announcement either.  \n\nGirlfriend is throwing out red flags here, and your family may be too wrapped up in the new baby excitement to appreciate it.  Is she going to continue to use the baby as a bargaining chip to get her way?  What else are you going to be expected to shunt aside because she a MUUUUTTTTHHHHERRR?", "Were they only coming for the day?

They could have announced their pregnancy separately on a different day. \n\nOr same day really. There's lots to celebrate all around. Could have just been an extra awesome day! I would be fine sharing the spotlight with my sibling, and becoming an aunt would have been a great birthday present.\n\nYour brother got in a tizzy for nothing.", "NTA. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re not only there for one day only. They could\u2019ve announced on Christmas Eve\u2026 talk about drama queens!!", "Hmm... brother's GF and brother are making a big issue out of your birthday, but it's \"your fault?\" Seems like you've been reasonable in compromising with them without allowing them to hold the entire holiday hostage to their demands.

NTA at all. Even if they are expecting why they cant announce it another day? They can perfectly chose a different day to share a news. You can NOT change your birthday date. And please do not fall for the \"didn\u2019t want to take away from me\" that is BS. They only want the \"spotlight\" just for them. You did not ruined Christmas they did! And you and your parents should still hold your ground because this is just the begging of this drama. You will keep hearing the: \"If you don't this you won se the baby\", \"If is not what I want you wont see the baby\" be prepare for that.

Your mom should have just crossed her legs until the day after! /s\n\nMy son was born in late November so his birthday falls on Thanksgiving every couple of years. He still gets his birthday cake, his pizza and presents.

So tell them congrats and maybe you\u2019ll see them next Christmas/your birthday.", "NTA\nBut I love your parents. The fact they have continued to celebrate it every year on the day and are not backing down as well is beautiful.

My uncle is also born on Christmas Day so I understand the issues it can create. What great parents you have!", "NTA!!

It\u2019s crazy. Everyone is together why not celebrate a birthday and a new baby while you\u2019re all in the same place? Why is it impossible to be happy about more than one thing at a time? It sounds to me that your family has much to celebrate and instead of basking in happiness, it has turned into a competition of special events. If they want to be petty about it, that\u2019s been your birth date for the last 24 years. Maybe they are the petty and selfish ones for wanting to steal your special day. I mean, they can literally announce a pregnancy any old day. Why are they demanding it be in your birthday? NTA", "I'm here after your edits. This was spiteful on their behalf. I'd have made New Year's a thing- keep it on theme new year, new family member, but whatever NTA. (And lucky you never had a family that just gave you a birthmas)", "NTA. Even after the edits, you didnt ruin Chrismas. They did. Firstly announcing a pregnancy is fine. Trying to take over Chrismas to do it is weird to me. Announce it any other day lol.

It's very obviously not your fault.  \n\nMy youngest is born within a few days of Christmas and we have always made sure that she gets Christmas and birthday gifts to make it fair.  We also don't put gifts under the tree until her birthday is over, so in a way her birthday has kind of become the kick-off to the holiday season when the kids were younger.  She would have her b-day, and the next day all the wrapped gifts would be under the tree for the kids to investigate.\n\nMy family has never cared much about having birthday celebrations on the actual day (what with work and school it was always hard to get everyone together on weekdays so we typically pushed birthday festivities to the nearest available Saturday.)  But if your tradition is to open gifts on the day, there's no reason for that to change just because your brother's girlfriend has a problem with it.  I think that she and your brother are being ridiculous about this and it's definitely not on you at all!", "Lol NTA your brother and his girlfriend are being extremely weird", "NTA, obviously", "NTA, who the hell does this woman think she is, demanding you not celebrate your birthday!? I'm glad your parents put their foot down", "Even with your final edit, NTA. You did nothing wrong. You didn\u2019t know your bro had big news to announce. You had no way of knowing that.

It is nice that they didn\u2019t want to take away from your birthday, but now that the secret is out, why are they still not coming? That makes it seem like they are the ones who are salty about having to share. Also, you were willing to be flexible so that they would come. Your parents shot that down. \n\nThis is not your fault.", "How were you to know? I'm impressed that your family has turned your Christmas birthday into an enjoyable tradition rather than the massive bummer it is for most Christmas babies.\n\nYour brother and his gf needed to be a little more open about the reason for their request.", "Saw your second edit and I still think they are being ridiculous. They are claiming they didn't want *you* to have to share with their baby news? You sound pretty reasonable and you likely wouldn't have cared. It's not like they NEED to announce it in the morning while you do birthday gifts. They can announce it whenever it feels right.

Now they are not coming to Christmas, punishing you and the whole family at a family celebration.\n\nPersonally, I don't understand why there couldn't be three things to celebrate on the same day, when the family is together. Could just have been separate events through the day.\n\nI hope it's all sorted amicably. Sadly, I suspect this is the tip of the iceberg with the GF.", "Response to the edit: they are the ones that ruined the surprise! Not you. They could have done it christmas eve and it would have been just as cute.", "NTA, but I'd ask him what kind of stunt he was trying to pull by making the holiday AND your birthday about he and his gf. He is well aware after 24 years that it's your birthday and how the family handles celebrating it. \n\nIt doesn't say how long they've been together, but by the fact that you created a new chat to welcome her into the planning hints at it not being too long. I could be wrong, though. \n\nIf she IS a \"new\" gf and this is her first holiday season together with him, she's already showing signs that she doesn't want to join the family, she wants to redesign it.

If she can't accept that, well, sucks to suck. \n\nAnd just for the record, I have a friend who had her son on Christmas day. About ONE TIME, the extended family tried to combine gifts and she told them that it would only be allowed if the gift were special enough to warrant it. They could be related gifts, like a Transformers for his bday and another for Christmas, but they do NOT get to say that a single little Spideman action figure covered both when all the other grandkids (including two on St. Pat's Day) get their own distinct celebrations for birthdays and holidays. It needed to be distinct - something for the birthday, and then whatever for the holiday from the family. It was never intended to be a \"give us more than the other kids\" but it definitely was a \"please remember, he is a child and doesn't understand why his cousins get parties on their birthday, but he just gets Christmas gifts\" sort of thing.

I (24F) have a birthday that falls on Christmas \u2014 every single year, as that\u2019s how it works. Apparently, this is a big, big issue with my brother (27M). \n\nWhen I was in little, my parents established that I would open my birthday gifts on Christmas \u2014 on my birthday \u2014 either before or after the Christmas gifts. They didn\u2019t want me to feel lesser and miss out on a birthday present by combining it with a Christmas present. I\u2019ve always appreciated that. The few times that it has been combined was by my request \u2014 they helped me buy a used car when I turned 19 as my present, then they paid for a trip once I graduated college. \n\nAnyways, we\u2019ve begun discussing holiday plans. My brother let us know that he planned on bringing his girlfriend (29F) so that my parents could purchase his plane tickets. After that, we started a new group chat to include her in our planning \u2014 my parents organize a Santa lunch and we usually go to a light show or caroling. My mom asked me if I wanted to open my birthday gifts at the beginning of the day or the end. I told her I didn\u2019t care. The chats and scheduling continued seemingly without issue. \n\nThen two or three days later, my brother asked me if we could do my birthday presents another time. Apparently, his girlfriend doesn\u2019t want to buy me a birthday gift AND Christmas gift \u2014 I was kind of wishy-washy about it. I didn\u2019t want to open them on a different day, but I told him that all she needed to do was sign her name on whatever he got me and that\u2019d be fine. She doesn\u2019t need to get me anything at all. He says that\u2019s not an option to her? She\u2019s freaking out and saying she won\u2019t come now. \n\nMy brother texted the chat and said I was making myself the star of the show on my birthday like always. He said that I refused to move my birthday (lol) and was making his girlfriend feel unwelcome. When dad stepped in and said I was allowed to enjoy my birthday on my birthday, that he and mom wanted me to celebrate then, my brother said he wasn\u2019t coming at all now. \n\nI talked to my parents separately and said we could change the day. I didn\u2019t care that much if it meant that Jack wouldn\u2019t come. They refused, saying it was the principle, but dad also let me know that my present is actually something to be done on my birthday/Christmas too. When my brother asked me \u201cto change my birthday\u201d again, this time I said no because I knew that there were plans involved. \n\nMy brother\u2019s girlfriend is now calling me a birthday grinch to anyone who will listen. \n\nAITA for being born on Christmas?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "nta. if anyone is making things about themselves it's the gf. she's invited to a family Christmas and tries to change their traditions, the audacity", "NTA - Your brother has dated her for less than a year or she would have known your b-day is Xmas day, since they have to fly to you have you ever even talked to her? I don't know why she can't just go in with whatever your brother is giving you, after all they are a couple. I don't see why she thinks she has to get someone she's never met a separate gift.", "Xmas bday too, 40 yrs of them. I hate the feeling that others are obligated to give bday presents, while most of them dont get gifts on their own bdays. I stopped the big bday celebration after presents years ago because of it.", "NTA - Wow your brother girlfriend sure does know how to make a great first impression on your family.", "NTA. My late great aunt was born on Christmas Eve. So she got double the presents.", "After ETA pt 2: you making a big stink about them announcing happy news on your birthday would definitely have made you the A but as it stands? No. They\u2019re just being overdramatic and, I suspect, wanted the spotlight on just their happy news instead of sharing.", "So your brother\u2019s girlfriend wanted to make your Birthday and Christmas about their upcoming baby. It had nothing to do with her having to buy 2 gifts. \n\nI was born wedged between Christmas and New Years. The only people that celebrated my birthday were my parents. \n\nA lot of babies born around Christmas get their birthdays forgotten. I\u2019m glad your parents aren\u2019t willing to do that.

It isn't. You didn't ruin Christmas. They ruined your birthday by thinking it was okay to take it over for their pregnancy announcement.", "NTA after second edit as well. It was there choice to take your birthday to announce their pregnancy. It seems idiotic to ask you to move your birthday.

Sounds like his gf is going to be a major thorn in your side for many years to come!", "I am coming onto this late and even with your edits you are STILL NTA. You did NOT ruin Christmas. Since they are flying in, that indicates to me they are going to be there a few days. They could have easily been the ones to change the day of their announcement to the day after Christmas. Instead they choose to ask you, you having no clue they were expecting and then tried to make you out to be the a-hole. Nope. NTA.", "NTA you had no idea what even a day was when you were born.  For all you knew you could have been born on Mars on Florb the day in which you need to buy a Plumbus.  \n\nYou are never guilty for existing on any day you were born no matter how inconvenient to the parents it may of been when it happened.

In fact I would say that makes their behaviour worse.  They had many choices here: a) announce on a different day b)announce anyway, with your permission c) tell you the real reason so you could choose to move your day d) tell you they want to do something special without telling you what it is, would you mind celebrating on say boxing day and e) STILL COME.  For pete's sake, how selfish can you be.  Lots of people do gifts on Christmas Eve, if they wanted the announcement to be a gift they could do that.", "Imagine being an AH for being born! Re: the last edit no it is NOT that they didn\u2019t want to take away from your bday with the announcement. It\u2019s that they didn\u2019t want your bday to take away the spotlight from their announcement. This is a them problem. They could have chosen another day to announce if this was a problem.

Or hear about it. Definitely NTA.", "NTA.

NTA .", "Ummm...NTA. And sorry they wanted the spotlight on them to say he knocked her up. At 27 he should have been able to realize you are able to have a birthday, celebrate Christmas, AND they do a baby announcement all at once without the world imploding. Shocking I know. You cannot change the date of your birth and for the next 80+ years that isn't going to change either, so they have to get past this. \n\nGo celebrate Christmas and your birthday with your parents. If they want to be 4 year olds and throw a temper tantrum that is on them. Not on you. \n\nPersonally, I find sharing \"big news\" on holiday tacky anyway. Just tell people on any random day if you want it to be special...so maybe I'm a celebration Grinch myself? Who knows??", "NTA\u2026 who would announce that they\u2019re expecting on someone\u2019s birthday REGARDLESS on if it landed on a holiday??? Lmao. I wouldn\u2019t feel guilty.

You're NTA, and this shouldn't even be a darn question!\n\nYour brother's girlfriend seems like a real piece of work. In all honesty, it looks like she may be pulling his chain, unless he's like this often. Obviously, you can't control when you were born, how people will react to situations, etc., their attitude problems shouldn't be a burden for you.\n\nNone of this, including what they were going to announce, is your fault, and you shouldn't feel bad for anything. That's what they want, probably, to hurt you and weigh you down emotionally more and more over nothing.\n\nOn the upside, it seems like your parents are decent, sensible people, so you have support there. I hope all goes well for you in the end.", "That last edit was bullshit.

It's never been a problem for me or anyone else. We do my cake and presents before Christmas presents. Your brother needs to get over himself, it's not like you chose to be born that day. If he was willing to do your presents another day then why couldn't his announcement be on another day?

You've said she doesn't need to get you anything for your birthday, that should be enough. And they're perfectly capable of announcing the pregnancy that day too as long as you're a reasonable person and they're reasonable people. I'll never understand why people feel the need to be the centre of attention for an entire get together. 3-4 hours gives enough time for focus on Christmas, birthday, and announcement. Do people need 4 hours just for one thing? I dont know, maybe it's just me since very pregnancy announcement I've ever made has been overshadowed by other things going on that it seems totally normal. Like people usually focus on one topic for, what, 20 mins? And then the conversation flows away organically from it. And it's not like a pregnancy announcement is the same as showing up with an actual surprise baby. The baby isn't actually... visible/able to be interacted with at a simple pregnancy announcement.\n\nAs adults, maybe it's time to stop making such a big deal about birthdays though?

You were right in the first reaction, why would you switch your birthday for a girlfriend of a sibling lmao. Not the asshole they could have planned for anyday other than christmas/birthday. I imagine they will be there for more than 1 day. If they wanted a holiday why not NEW YEARS. Literally a single week later and a great time to do it. Start the new year with a baby announcment!

The brother could easily just wait until the \u201cbirthday\u201d part of the Xmas gathering is over and then do the big announcement later, it\u2019s not like OP having her few hours as the centre of attention beforehand would make that any less significant, but instead he\u2019s whining about how it\u2019s not all about him.  What a baby.", "I\u2019m old and my parents still buy the plane tickets because they have the funds and I don\u2019t, and they\u2019re the ones that moved to a place with a small airport (=more expensive tickets). Plus, a trip means I incur a lot of expenses outside of actual travel - pet sitter, parking at the airport or transport to/from, and loss of income when I\u2019m out of town. Hell, trying to buy food at an airport is expensive AF. I don\u2019t feel bad about this one single bit.", "ooh that\u2019s genius!!", "This is a longtime family tradition bro & gf are trying to hijack. Gf could get a token gift - a candle, small plant, a dated ornament....almost like a hostess gift bc she doesn't know OP. Or a card \"wishing you happiness\" . But has to make a BFD. Bet she will claim the whole YEAR of no one else can have events, if they plan a wedding...\n\nOP  is NTA", "OP, I\u2019ve since read your edit, and for the record my judgment is absolutely the same, you are NTA and you didn\u2019t ruin anything. I might actually be a little more upset by this if it were me. \n\nSo it\u2019s not about getting you an additional gift, it\u2019s about entirely overtaking your birthday and a family holiday. She says she didn\u2019t want to ruin your birthday or take away from you, but if that\u2019s true, all she had to do was NOT DO THAT! Do the announcement on Christmas Eve, or the next day! This is still the same selfish thought process as the gift issue (or lie? Apparently?)- she absolutely wants to take your birthday and perhaps the biggest holiday of the year and make it about her, she just 1) doesn\u2019t want to be perceived as doing that, and 2) absolutely does not want to share any attention on the day. So it works out great for her if you reschedule your birthday, but either way it is still a huge slight to you. \n\nI don\u2019t know what she expected when she decided to craft this unnecessary plan, that had to be kept a secret, and then expect your family to make a pretty unreasonable accommodation without knowing what it is for. I\u2019ve been pregnant, I\u2019ve announced it to family, I didn\u2019t insist on making a big day for everyone into MY big day. It\u2019s still selfish.", "I like your style.", "Man, this whole thing is silly. So they wanted all the attention because she got creampied on? Tell your bro to grow up, he is going to be a dad soon.", "My issue was more \"how is the GF so shocked about the reveal that you also get birthday gifts from your family?\"\nThe additional info just means I really don't get the GFs problem whatsoever or why it would be so stressful.\n\nIs she just trying to cause drama?\n\nBecause this sounds like something my narcissistic older sister (30s) would pull.", "Well then I'm even more surprised by her reaction because if it was a complete surprise your birthday is then, I could grant /some/ understanding. But only a smidge. She really seems to have taken it out of proportion.", "Hey OP, I just want to give you a hug for this. As a new auntie myself, whose Christmas was a bit ruined by an overwrought and self-centered sibling pregnancy announcement last year (very unexpected!!), I just want to assure you that you ARE going to get excited about it. You don\u2019t get that moment back but there are lots more moments. Congratulations :) :) :)", "I'm a NYE baby, and trying to organize anything if I want to do something is next to impossible as people prefer to go to big parties and I prefer something smaller. My partner keeps forgetting how old I am as well. He gets it right for the year if I'd already had my birthday but by the time it comes around he's forgotten and has to recalibrate his brain.", "Thanks \ud83d\ude19", "You aren't the bad guy. Some people are weird about sharing special days. You don't have a choice! And they should have positioned it as an awesome birthday/Christmas present for everyone. :) Just tell them you are excited for them and being an auntie. Hoping for you this blows over quickly.", "I don\u2019t get why she had to spill all their details and didn\u2019t just pivot.", "What do your parents have to say about all of this?", "Still NTA\u2026she doesn\u2019t get to decide when your birthday should be held and why is she making your birthday about her and what she needs? Sounds like main character syndrome!", "Your brother is an asshole for letting her worry about it. She barely knows you. He should be helping her pick out a couple small things. It sounds like you don't even make a big deal about it. It's not like celebrating Christmas is so time consuming you can't focus on anything else besides Christmas... that sounds exhausting", "Well, my grandparents were crappy parents, which in turn, made my mom a crappy mom. I broke that cycle with my children", "My birthday is less than two weeks before Christmas, and when I was a little kid, we never put the tree up until after my birthday. Once I got old enough to help decorate for the holiday (actually *help*, not make a worse mess while putting up two ornaments and breaking things), I was also old enough to want the tree up all month, so we put it up Thanksgiving weekend.", "Please do that", "Isn't she going to have to start dealing with Christmas also being your birthday? Or Christmas being other people's favorite? \n\nIt's like she's decided she's the center of the universe because a, it's her favorite holiday, and b, she's pregnant. The inflexibility is a concern, especially when they could have said, hey, we have something special planned, or understood your parents made plans that can't be rescheduled. You can't expect everyone to drop what they're doing just because you want them to. The story they came up with, them demanding you move your bday because she didn't want to get you a gift, is also a stupid self centered story even though it was made up. Then instantly going to \"i'm not coming\" then?\n\nI'm sure you're right and they'll be ok parents, but they need to grow up a little and it concerns me how selfish she is. NTA obviously.", "My response was wrong-I meant all of this is exhausting.  It's your birthday-your brother knows how your family handles it. If they wanted to surprise your parents this was the wrong way to do it.  He also could have told you!  They have no right to be mad at you.", "My mom still makes me dye Easter eggs lol it\u2019s a thing", "My in-laws have a bingo night for Christmas. There's 20-30 envelopes with gift cards and cash of varying amounts, $25-50, and the \"grand prize\" final game is for $250 cash. Everyone is guaranteed to win at least twice in the early rounds, so nobody gets left out.\n\nTo win the final game, you have to completely fill your card. They said that it was both easier and more fun than buying presents for all of their kids and spouses. Grandkids still get presents, of course.", "That\u2019s the scary part too. Good luck to everyone especially the kid!!", "Exactly. It seems to me that Christmas and your birthday would have been even more special with a wonderful announcement like that.\n\nI bet your SIL would be the kind of bride who wants the entire season to be about her. \"You can't get married in June because I was already **thinking about** getting married in September.\"", "We have three family members in the extended family with birthdays on the 24th, 26th and 27th.", "Also. If they're gonna be there long enough to celebrate OP's birthday a different day... Can't they also therefore announce a different day? Even could do a cutesy spin on it. \n\nDec 26th: \"Oh everyone, we almost forgot! We have another present, it's for the whole family, but unfortunately, it's running a bit late!\" (*Picture of ultrasound or whatever other announcement prop they had planned*) \n\nWhat's wrong with extra celebration, anyway? Have all the parties! OP 's birthday, Christmas, future nibling! All the cake and pie and happiness. There's no limit to joy, so why not have even more? GF is ridiculous.", "I have this feeling, this is only the start of Baby mamm's entitlement. Lord help this family going forward", "The more I\u2019m sitting on it, the angrier I\u2019m getting. I would have happily shared the day \u2014 I always do anyways! Even if my parents and family wish me a happy birthday, it\u2019s less present to everyone else than a typical birthday. And I\u2019m fine with that! The people who matter most typically respect the matter!\n\nMy brother should have known I\u2019d have been okay with it. Before all this happened, I\u2019d have said he\u2019s one of my best friends. Now it\u2019s feels like I\u2019m stupid to think that", "They can announce on Jan 1, can't they?", "Why do people think we can only hold so much joy in one day? I would be capable of celebrating a birthday, a pregnancy reveal, AND Christmas all in one day and I would enjoy it all too. It would go down as best day ever", "They could have announced the pregnancy at literally any other day than on your bday/xmas. That\u2019s the easiest thing to move!!!", "My god it gets even worse(just read the edits), wanting you to change the day of your birthday so she can make an announcement on that day, could she be anymore self centred. She could literally do that any other time. Your brother is a gigantic asshole for going along with this and making it all about them and trying to make you feel guilty for celebrating your birthday on your birthday.\n\nI hope you have a great time, especially on the ugly sweater bar crawl that sounds fun.", "In this case, clearly Jesus is the AH. If anyone should change his birthday, it's him.", "According to the updates, gf and brother are expecting a baby. So yes, this will probably be the year of \"no one else can celebrate anything because we are having the greatest celebration of all!\"", "I don\u2019t know!! Maybe she thinks Christmas is Christmas and shouldn\u2019t be anything else? It\u2019s just not how my family has treated the day.", "Lmao, not sure if you saw my edit. She wanted to announce she\u2019s pregnant on Christmas.", "I don't get why she didn't accept Christmas wouldn't turn out how she planned it. You can't choose how people celebrate christmas. And making it about your pregnancy instead of someone's birthday is selfish. Just casually announce it. No silly games. No fuss.", "I really hope they aren\u2019t blaming you for \u201cruining\u201d their announcement\u2026", "Like I say. She/They just wanted the attention! Have your brother complain about your birthday on Christmas before? If not is just her wanted everyone say: OMG how nice is she to do all this to tell us she is pregnant. And like you say is her favorite holiday, so she is just dong for herself. And I guess your brother is just doing whatever she wants just to make her happy. Hold your ground sweetheart this is just the beginning. Next year is going to be: \"But is the baby first Christmas, don't be *selfish* (Trust me they are gonna use that word A LOT) is now about him and not about you. You celebrate a lot of birthdays already\"  \n\n\nAnd you birthday celebrations sound A LOT OF FUN! I would enjoy doing all that birthday or not. Lucky you (as long as you like it hahahaha)", "They feel bad for me and are frustrated with them. My mom is sad that she found out about her first grandchild in the midst of such negativity.", "I\u2019ve poked the bear too much today\u2026.", "My mom started hosting a neighborhood easter egg hunt instead of doing a small one for the household lol we still dye eggs at night", "This was my thought exactly. It kinda sounds like the brother has always been resentful of when your birthday is and doesn't want your birthday to overshadow his announcement.", "I literally just commented this. \n\nLike even if their gift is a ultra sound, say you forgot to pack it and 'find' it the next day.\n\nWhat's next? OP move your birthday cos its babys 1st Xmas?", "Yup can\u2019t have a birthday next year it\u2019s baby\u2019s first Christmas", "The fact that he's 27 with a 29 year old that still need mommy and daddy to buy their plane tickets says a lot about how immature your brother is.  The fact that this is a big deal means your parents were going to meet her and find out they were pregnant at the same time, which screams oopsy and knocked up louder than you ever can.  Don't worry, your brother seems the type that their will be many more girlfriends and unplanned pregnancies for him to announce in the future... I mean, it's hard to plan out an elaborate xmas announcement and forget your sisters birthday on xmas.", "OP,  your brother knows the routine.  They could announce their pregnancy the day before or the day after (I'd choose the day after) at lunch,etc.\n\nWhile it would be cute to have the scavenger hunt ... that isn't a necessity and they can save that for another time and place...they can think of another cute way to announce it.\n\nShe is coming into a family tradition and trying to change everything to make it about them and the baby. ... I understand the impulse, but  ... not the behavior.\n\nWe all change our plans now and again ... NTA.  \n\n Your brother should have guided her in a helpful direction but sounds like childhood resentment about your birthday on Xmas ... where you got more that day than he did...kicked in.\n\nTakes kids a few years before they can work out that your birthday on Xmas isn't  the advantage that it seemed when they were young ... seems the resentment kicked in before that.", "What is up with all these elaborate pregnancy announcements anyway? I'm getting close to having my first baby, and we mostly just called and texted folks based on when we were comfortable with them knowing. I did do a Facebook post somewhere around the 7 month mark, just to be \"official\" and catch anyone we hadn't told yet. \n\nBrother and SIL could make this announcement whenever and it would still be special. Why co-opt a day that is already two things and then pout that you had to share?", "Which is totally valid. And kudos to your parents for making accommodations so you get enjoyable time every year!", "Jesus gatekeeped that day and you should be ashamed of yourself for having the audacity to be born on Dec.25th! \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut honestly, if he wants your birthday to be flexible, then shouldn\u2019t Christmas be flexible too? \n\nIf they were smart, they would have made the announcement on new years... Ya know, celebrating a New Year and new life to come.\n\nAnyways, NTA.", "Obviously you\u2019re NTA regardless. Your brother is acting like a big baby and they could have just used thanksgiving to do the announcement instead of using your birthday/xmas. (Also, announcing pregnancies at xmas as if this was a gift delivered to the extended family is kinda corny?)", "Newsflash to her: she doesn\u2019t get everything she wants just because she\u2019s pregnant", "How disrespectful to have a birthday on her big announcement day!!!! Why should she share HER special day? Waaaa!!! Waaaa!!!\n\nAt least your parents saved money by not having to buy their plane tickets, and btw why can't your brother buy his own? Also, I bet the announcement WAS everyone's Christmas gift and now the couple has to also buy YOU a birthday present. They thought that they would have a free trip, not have to spend money on presents, but receive a bunch of presents instead. You ruined EVERYTHING!! /s   NTA", "Pffffff, oh wow. If not for you claiming that sil is 29 I'd legit be asking if your brother was somehow married to my sister because this type of bananas behaviour is text-book behaviour from my sister.\n\n- panic about your birthday being on Christmas\n- \"don't want to buy present but doesn't want to not do either\"\n- wants you to move your birthday celebration without saying why\n- /starts trash-talking you to other people and calling you birthday grinch even though you were actually willing to move it but your parents are firm on their principles/\n\nAll because she wanted to be the special girl on /your actual birthday/ with her pregnancy announcement.\n\nGeeez.\n\nReal glad your parents stuck to their principles because with this behaviour I would not be surprised if SIL would then go on to imply that from here on out you keep your celebration on whatever day you would have moved it too because it would be \"rude to her\" to steal her special \"announcement anniversary\" from her in the future by \"making it all about you\".\n\nAlso, super freakin late but I only just realised I forgot my \"judgement\". You're NTA for being born on Christmas.", "Of course she is.", "I strongly feel like our moms would be bffs. I LOVE that she\u2019s doing a neighborhood hunt. That\u2019s peak mom energy.", "TBf I'm 35 and needed my mom to buy my plane ticket to my brother's wedding this year as I simply couldn't afford it after unexpected vet costs. \n\nIf he expects them to pay every time but actually has enough money to do it himself, you're correct though.", "I don't know if needing parents to buy your plane tickets when you're 27 is necessarily a sign of emotional immaturity\u2014 The pandemic put a lot of people's professional goals back, and a lot of people suffered financial difficulties because of it.\n\nAll that being said, if they're not able to afford plane tickets, it does raise the question of whether they're financially solvent enough to take care of a baby.", "I\u2019m texting him separately to ask that. He didn\u2019t reply to my other texts today", "Jesus did not, in fact, gatekeep that day, because Jesus was not born on Christmas.", "To quickly say, regarding the plane tickets, my parents have been very fortunate. Growing up, they taught us the value of money, even if it meant we had a few struggles in college or shortly after. Still, they do like to take care of us in certain ways \u2014 obviously birthday and christmas presents. But covering travel expenses for holidays has always been something they\u2019ve insisted. They had experiences where family members couldn\u2019t make it to big events and missed out. They want to make sure everyone is included if they can.", "When she became an empty nester, she decided the neighborhood was her new nest lol The santa lunch, easter egg hunt\u2026 she does it all lol. Her social calendar is much more packed than mine lol", "Yeah, that's vastly different from needing/wanting your parents to buy your tickets to meet the girl you just knocked up. Since the gf is upset about Ops bday, it's safe to assume this is a newish relationship starting off with a bang and no pullout.", "So you don\u2019t think the parents suffered from the pandemic as well? My parents would give me the last dollar they had if I said I needed it, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re in a financial position to do so. I just know they would because of a parents love.

She\u2019s the type of momma I wanna be. Give her a squeeze from a internet stranger for her mom energy, and for having your (birthday back. \n\nPs. Be sad but don\u2019t drown in it. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. If you\u2019re feeling like you need to extend the olive branch send your bro an itty bitty onesie.

Give it some time and let it breathe. Maybe ask your mom about it after your bro has time to gripe about it/get over it. Either way, you\u2019re NTA.
