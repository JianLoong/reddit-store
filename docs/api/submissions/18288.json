Men and women have equal choice at the most critical stage - when they participate in sex that causes a pregnancy - and again it's why society puts the onus of responsibility on both parents at conception.\n\nIndividual circumstances vary - but I'd say the reality of most fathers being less effected physically and economically by parenthood is a technicality that helps balance it out - along with their tendency to be less attached to and more prone to abandoning their children (both planned and unplanned).", "He didn't wear a condom that broke, he chose to put the birth control responsibility on his partner.

It is adults making unintelligent decisions then getting upset when they have consequences.\n\nLiterally why I said each person is in charge of their own sexual health.", "It would work?", "Yep, exactly. I\u2019m glad you get it.", "If birth control fails, get an abortion if you dont want it.\nA woman has rights, more rights than a man.\nRape is of course horrible, I would not wish that on anyone.", "She has an abortion you get no say.", "It shouldn't be a gender issue, but it seems to be.", "YTA. So everyone was having a nice evening until you decided to take out your own fertility issues on Frank.\n\nIs Frank married? Or is the woman you called his side piece his partner?", "YTA. It wasn\u2019t the time or place to bring that up.", "ESH but really the only ones I feel bad for are this company\u2019s HR department and the kid who will probably grow up without a father. \n\nThe woman probably didn\u2019t lie about being infertile like some people are implying. Things happen. Frank is just as responsible for making the baby and needs to take responsibility. Condoms exist, he should have used one.\n\nOP obviously you\u2019re feeling a very strong way about your fertility struggles which is totally normal, but if you know you have such strong feelings of anger towards Frank you should\u2019ve stood firm with your husband and not hung out with him in the first place. It seems like you were waiting for an opportunity to tell him your mind\u2026 he definitely deserves it but it\u2019s not your place. Also your husband should draw a line between his work and this friendship, especially now that his wife is getting involved. What a mess", "YTA. Unless she was tested and proven not to have a uterus there\u2019s every chance she could get pregnant if she lead him on to believe she couldn\u2019t she\u2019s not a victim here and doesn\u2019t need you to defend her. This isn\u2019t any of your business your letting your own situation prejudice you against him.", "YTA\n\nFirstly. It's not your business. If you can't get pregnant, you get IVF for that, not turn into a gossip queen.\n\nSecondly, she deceived him. She told him she couldn't get pregnant, he was adamant he didn't want kids. Sounds simple, she either get an abortion or raise the kid alone. Her baby trapping technique backfired. The fault is hers and no one else's.", "You reacted out of our jealousy that he is fertile and you are not. That\u2019s a you issue that you need to deal with yourself. By age 40 a woman is perfectly capable of preventing pregnancy by herself and she has the options of abortion and adoption to rid herself of any unwanted pregnancies. Pregnancy is absolutely a choice at that age and not a very smart one with such a geriatric, high risk pregnancy. It is a particularly bad choice when you knew up front that the man doesn\u2019t want kids and you assured him you couldn\u2019t have any. They don\u2019t agree about this baby and have gone to court to get a fair, impartial, legal resolution to the problem. It\u2019s none of your business so stop interfering and jeopardising your husband\u2019s income. YTA.", "ESH. You all are way too old to be dealing with this type of drama. You\u2019re closer to nursing home age than party age.", "What? She misled him. He shouldn\u2019t have to pay a dime", "Yes\nAnd no it was the chick he was trying to get with that night.", "They are both adults in their 40's who presumably know how sex works. No one forced them to go raw. They chose to gamble and are equally responsible.", "You\u2019re right. About it all. Won\u2019t make that mistake again. Maybe that\u2019s why I put it all out because I knew I would never be in a situation to hang out with him again. Just feel terrible for the situation I put husband in.", "Infertile just means it is harder to have kids, not that you can't. She didn't lie by saying that.", "Haha agreed. Sucks it turned out like this and he couldn\u2019t just man up in the first place. Wanted or not.", "Infertile does not mean sterile and she may not have realized that she could still get pregnant.", "My boyfriend had a vasectomy and I refuse to stop taking birth control. That shit isn't 100%. Birth control isn't 100%. Condoms aren't 100%. Doctors aren't right 100% of the time. This is like 5th grade sex education stuff. If you really don't wanna have a baby, take every precaution possible, but also know that if you do have sex there's still always a chance someone ends up pregnant. Dude's a total dumbass if he thinks he can nut in anyone 100% risk free, wtf.\n\n(Probably OP you're still the AH for the public confrontation, sorry. I know it's hard to hold it in sometimes but this is an issue to be confronted in private or not at all. If I were you I would have just ignored the person completely, or left and gone home if he was bothering me. Also y'all should just not hang out with this dude, he seems like he sucks.)", "Yes but what does any of that have to do with you?  You have no horse in that race.  Yta for inserting yourself into it based on your personal issues with fertility.  Whether or not he's an asshole isn't the question at hand", "She could have aborted", "People create children.\n\nChildren need care.\n\nSociety put systems of accountability in place for providing care to children.\n\nThe ease with which parental rights can be terminated has far reaching consequences - at the cost of the child and the society that would shoulder the burden.\n\nA sperm donor is arranged, and often paid for their service, by parents that want to support and have exclusive rights to the child. It's an entirely different situation, and illogical comparison.\n\nWhen a man and woman consensually engage in intercourse, they're both responsible for the risk of pregnancy.\n\nWomen have the unequal task of bearing the children, so they have unequal say in ending the pregnancy - but both parents are responsible for the result of their actions at the point of conception.\n\nWould you rather mothers and fathers be held economically responsible for the children they create, or have every single taxpayer take on their support instead?\n\nHe made it clear he did not want kids, she made it clear she previously wanted children and had tried to conceive with her partners without success.\n\nShe clearly didn't want kids with Frank based on their hooking up under the assumption of infertility. Regardless of how unintended the pregnancy was or how unsuitable the father is, it seems she'll try to see it through. Regardless of how functional Frank's penis is, it seems he's no man.", "*at least in some states in the USA, I say as someone who lives in a state where a 10-year old rape victim was denied an abortion.", "I get what you are saying but doesn't that make the girl equally liable? How is it good to force a child on someone? What kind of resentment does it build? And is it any healthy? All of these big discussions about being Pro choice in America, but that doesn't save you guys from having childhood trauma and an abusive toxic relationship with your parents. I firmly believe if the girl said it's not a problem, the large part of the responsibility lies with her. Especially when she wants the kid. You want a kid but you can't depend on yourself to pay for the child. If I don't want it, i am ready to pay for the procedure. Deciding YOU want a child when your partner doesn't want it is peak weak human behaviour. It's not like they were in a relationship. It's not like he was exploiting her and is ready to fly at a moment's notice. They hooked up. I'm ready for the downvotes but this is how it is. \n\nAnd all of this considered OP is still TA. It's none of her business.", "He doesn't have to be a parent, paying child support is not being a parent.", "Well I do actually like your post, well made and thought out.\nThough on the last bit, clearly she did want the kid, she kept it.", "This is a great comment. So well put and so many good points. So thank you. \nUltimately She did not want his kids. But after trying elsewhere and being under the impression she couldn\u2019t have kids she was not going to give up this child.", "I do agree that the abortion bans some states have imposed are completely and utterly ridiculous, but unfortunately we'll have to save that conversation for a different thread.", "No; there's a difference between saying you're infertile and saying you can't get pregnant.", "She wanted a kid, tried with multiple partners. She didn't want a kid *with Frank*.", "More people need to understand that fertility is really not as straightforward as a doctor telling them they probably can't have kids. Way too many people take that as they're sterile so no need to use birth control. I had infertility issues for more than two years, then one month it just worked and now my 3-month-old is taking a nap in the other room lol. IDK if it's just doctors not educating people in what infertility means or general failure of sex ed, but if you still have the parts you should assume it's still possible.", "And she could have taken the pill ot had an abortion. Given he didn't want to kids and she KNEW that, it's obvious where the fault lies.", "That wouldn't be fair. It would *drastically* favour men. Basically give them no consequences for stealthing, getting women pregnant left and right, putting all the consequences of failed contraception on women only, all while laughing their smarmy little heads off about it.\n\nAlso, I'm very sorry you feel that men should have the right to force women to have an abortion. Unfortunately bodily autonomy trumps all else. We can't even take life-saving organs from a dead body if the person didn't consent before death.", "Nah my dude, you can't always blame the woman. Good try though.", "You seem to be confused, infertility and sterility are not the same thing. \n\nPeople who are \u201cinfertile\u201d still have a chance of having children, no matter how small the chance is there is a chance. To be precise infertility is \u201cmeasured by failure to conceive after 1 year without contraception\u201d. People who are \u201csterile\u201d are not physically able to produce a live child at all. Saying you\u2019re infertile doesn\u2019t mean you can never get pregnant. Man\u2019s should have wore a condom.", "She tells him she can't have kids. He tells her he doesn't want a kid.\n\nShe gets pregnant and instead of aborting, she keeps it and expects child support. There is NO ONE else to blame here but the woman. \n\nIf she wasn't sure, she should have warned him. Guys who are adamant about not wanting kids generally wear a condom.", "There, I corrected it so I stop getting pedantic answers. I am not a native English speaker so I mixed the term, my apologies. The same point however still stands. Clearly the woman did not think she was capable of conceiving a child, hence being sterile, because she did not insist on a condom.\n\nFrom OPs comments, I understood she told the guy that she cannot bear children, when this was false info. She based her info on not being able to become pregnant with her previous partners, not medical tests. As you pointed out, she did not medically test whether or not she was sterile and worked based on assumption. \n\nI think it's a disgusting thing to do. She should not have said she cannot have children as it is not confirmed and should have insisted for other methods of birth control.\n\nI am sure he did think of using a condom but then she said she cannot have children so they decided not to. I don't really see how the issue would come up otherwise.\n\nUsing a condom is not solely up to the guy."]}
