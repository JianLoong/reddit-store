But, I can also understand why your GF would be upset. You\u2019re going with your ex a few days early and staying with your ex Gf\u2019s family who you didn\u2019t get along with in the past to the point of blocking them on your phone. Would you be totally fine with her missing a (hopefully) once in a lifetime family event to be with an ex for a funeral and being with them for days (not just a few hours)? I\u2019m not gonna sugarcoat this, there\u2019s a chance you come back from the funeral with her stuff moved out.", "Okay wait - you and the ex blocked each other because it got so heated but she came by your house after her brother died - and she didn\u2019t know you and the brother were still close ??? How did she know where you lived if you hadn\u2019t been in contact ?? She wants you to go home to the funeral and stay with her extra days ??? Ummm hello if you were blocked for years how did she know where you live ??? None of this adds up. Seems like you might have still been in touch with her ??  Also a funeral is for the living not the deceased .   You already had a phone conversation with her family and visited with her when she showed up at your door by mental telepathy- since y\u2019all had no contact \ud83d\ude44.  You say you want to marry your girlfriend now but you are picking your old girlfriend and her family over her.  This has nothing to do with Dan - he is gone.  You are gonna stay with your ex for days when emotions are everywhere snd think that is not a slap in your girlfriends face.  This is the death shot to your relationship and you will only have yourself to blame.  You could always go back to where Dan is laid to rest and pay your respects at a later time.  Like my brother\u2019s Ranger brothers have done over the years.  Some didn\u2019t go to the funeral so, they have gone by his gravesite and left notes and Ranger coins and etc.  You need to say it like it is - you are choosing your past instead of your future and you will only have yourself to blame when you have to build s new future because of your choices.", "YWNBTA for making this choice.  But, honestly, neither will your GF be when she ends your relationship.  You are making a choice to prioritize an old relationship versus your current one.  Funerals are not for the deceased, they are for the ones left behind.  You will not disparage your friend if you do not go to the funeral.  If you choose the funeral there is a good chance you will be terminally poisoning your relationship.", "What is wrong with you? Get a rental car and motel.", "I kind of understand wanting to go to the funeral, I do not understand the need to be with your ex and her family for multiple days over the course of the funeral. If it really is just about Dan, you should thank them for letting you know and then stop talking to them again. I get why your gf feels like you\u2019re picking your ex over her.\n\nAlso I think it\u2019s shitty to commit to something and then back out.", "The thing is now you are going to spend two days ahead the funeral and be in the same car with alone your ex for at least 14 hours. Can you blame your gf for being insecure? How about you? Will you be okay if your gf does that to you? I dont know man. Unless you can find some way or borrow some money just to fly in, give your last respect to your friend, and fly out ASAP.", "YTA if you go *with* your ex and stay with her family.  That would be inappropriate, if you truly value your 2 year relationship that is close to engagement.\n\nI don't care if you have to pawn something off but find the money to get yourself there and back on your own because traveling with the ex and staying with her family is really distasteful for someone that's supposedly in a committed relationship.\n\nI do hope that once she cools down and thinks about her words, your girlfriend will see that you attending the funeral is necessary for your grieving process.  But again, don't go and spend **days** with your ex if you value your relationship with your girlfriend.", "I\u2019m having trouble with this - are you asking the internet for permission so you feel better about it?  Your friend is gone. You would be going for the living that he left behind. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this changes your girlfriend\u2019s feelings about how serious you are about her.", "I love how you mentioned your \"passionate\" relationship with your ex.  Lmao", "YTA if you travel with your ex on a very emotional trip and expect your gf to be ok with it. Just end things with her so you have a clean break because it\u2019s not like you\u2019re still going to be together with her for long after this trip. Rekindling a relationship with your ex and her family, even if you are not intending this to be a romantic relationship with her, is going to create a whole new dynamic that you can\u2019t expect your gf to be ok with.\n\nIf your gf was canceling on something important with you to spend 14 hours alone in a car with her ex, as well as staying for a number of days with her ex and his family, would you be happy about that?", "YTA - so the problem is staying 2 nights with Julia and her family here. I wouldn\u2019t be upset you went to the funeral but I would be super uncomfortable with you sleeping in the next room as an ex. Even with all the trust in the world it\u2019s a big ask. I think you have the chance to grieve Dan at a later time. His family completely cut you off your relationship with Dan was private. Amelia is your future. I would think carefully and weigh all your choices because I think this could end things with Amelia", "NAH. You were involved with your late friend\u2019s family for years and you cared for him. I feel uncomfortable with his parents stating they would \u201cregard you as family from now on.\u201d You\u2019re not family and you may be setting yourself up for some inappropriate bonding and behavior from them at the funeral and in the future. You\u2019re not the AH whatever you decide but my opinion is that a heartfelt loving letter of sympathy would be more appropriate than dedicating 4 or more days to being in the company of your late friend\u2019s family and your ex girlfriend.", "For the sake of a decision , I have to say that YTA. You can grieve Dan without going to the funeral. Driving on an emotional visit with your ex girlfriend, 2 days early, and staying in her parents house is definitely quite weird, even with the excuse that you are lacking money. I can't put my finger on it, but something just seems a bit off with what you've described.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUltimately the choice is yours.\n\n1. Go to the funeral, you are absolutely not getting engaged to your current girlfriend, who you claim to want to marry\n2. Don't go to the funeral, going there with your EXE'S FAMILY will ultimately ruin any peaceful chances of grieving him that you would have anyway. Then explain to your girlfriend your thought process around the whole thing, she should ultimately understand", "Travelling with your ex and staying with her family for extra days is not appropriate.  You say that you want to marry your GF, you made a commitment to go to her sisters wedding, if you choose to abandon those plans you should be aware that your GF will more than likely soon be your ex.", "Going against the grain here\u2014YWBTA to attend the funeral instead of the wedding.\n\nYou are planning (\u201cclose to\u201d) an engagement with a woman that you live with, who it sounds like has been supporting you through the stress of a medical residency (since you\u2019ve gotten permission from your co-residents to take time off to do this).\n\nAmelia will remember, and likely always be hurt by, this decision to support someone else on the occasion of her sister\u2019s wedding.  You can still remember/memorialize Dan another way\u2014but you should be there *in person* to support Amelia.", "I'm between Soft YWBTA and NAH.  \n\nBut I'm surprised that you didn't seem to have clue that you were supposed to go to a wedding at the same time as the funeral. \n\nIn the end it doesn't matter at all what we say here. All that matters is how important your gf is for you vs the funeral and how strong your relationship are. \n\nThis will for sure make your gf question how tight you are (which your fight showed). And especially since you will go with your ex. For your gf it's not a trip you're doing on your own for an old friend, it's a trip your doing with your ex!  I think it would be a lot different if you ex wasn't involved in this. But now you need to totally depend on her since you can't afford this.", "NAH but if I was your GF this would be the end of the relationship for me.\n\nFunerals are for the living. Driving down with her and staying extra time with the family is what swings it for me. That has nothing to do with Dan and is all about the ex. And you are choosing your ex's family over your GF's.\n\nIf you can go to the funeral without driving with your ex or staying with her family you would be NTA because then it is about your friend.", "YTA- you\u2019re spending 2 days with ex before funeral. You could borrow $, go to the wedding and fly to the funeral. \n\nDefinitely the AH", "Sorry mate, but YTA. It\u2019s terrible your exes brother died and that you\u2019d had a good relationship, but ditching your partner for that is a really bad look. I\u2019m usually all for funerals over other things but this one I think you\u2019re wrong. You are dedicating to your past instead of your future family and that\u2019s not right. It\u2019s sad he died but family couldn\u2019t attend my dads funeral for less intense reasons and so I just think it\u2019s wholly inappropriate. Problem is you\u2019ve made decisions now, you should have immediately explained to your ex that you will be sending thoughts and best wishes and under other circumstances you would go, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019d have understood, but your gf isn\u2019t going to forgive you for picking your exes family over hers. That\u2019s that.\n\nI think if you and your ex had kids together I could understand because it would be for the kids sake, but generally exes should be in the past, you kept your friendship secret because it wouldn\u2019t be accepted by them and now they\u2019re pulling you back into the fold.. just not good.", "NAH here, but this may put a strain on or end your current relationship.", "If you choose to go to the wedding you could do a few things instead. \n\nPerhaps go visit Dan\u2019s parents now before the funeral to chat about Dan. Arrange for a bouquet or wreath via a florist to arrive at the funeral home.", "NAH. I can fully understand wanting to go to grieve the loss of your friend. Even if you went to the wedding instead I could only imagine how horrible it would be to be around celebrations while you\u2019re grieving. However, your gf has a right to be uncomfortable with the arrangements of you travelling and staying with your ex for the funeral and missing an event with her family that you\u2019d already agreed to. It sounds like you\u2019ve made up with your exes family so even with all the trust in the world it\u2019s still uncomfortable. Sorry you\u2019re in this situation.", "Info: do you have to stay and travel with your ex? I don't think you're an A H but I think you're not really thinking this through. I think this will seriously hurt your current relationship.", "The issue is travelling with your ex and staying with the family imo. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "YTA if you take up the offer to go with your ex and stay with her family. This should not be an offer you would ever consider, it\u2019s inappropriate and your gf isn\u2019t \u201cjealous\u201d, this is something that is crossing her boundaries of what she is and isn\u2019t comfortable with. If you cross this boundary it will either end your relationship or set it up for failure. \n\nIf you choose to go to this funeral, which you have every right to do, it must NOT involve communication or spending time with your ex beyond the funeral event itself. Go by yourself, stay by yourself. If you can\u2019t afford it, don\u2019t go. The staying with ex gf option is not an option. Your gf cannot be upset if you go to a funeral for a close friend and miss the wedding. She absolutely has a right to be upset if you travel and stay with your ex gf. Very inappropriate and uncomfortable for her regardless of how much she trusts you. You respect her boundaries or you violate them. Your choice.", "YTA your ex girlfriend invited you on a long drive just the two of you and you would be traveling with her a couple of days before the funeral so you\u2019ll be spending the whole time with her. If you don\u2019t think your are prioritizing your ex girlfriend over your current one you are delusional. Concentrate on reviving the very passionate relationship you used to have with your ex because you just ended your current relationship", "YTA if you drive with the ex and spend days with her and her family. You and ex are going to be very emotionally raw, reminiscing about the old days, etc. That\u2019s leaving the door wide open for emotional bonding to walk right back in. I can see going to the funeral but NOT spending all the extra time with her and her family. Leave them in the past where they belong.", "It sounds like Dan wasn\u2019t \u201cyour ex\u2019s brother\u201d but rather \u201cyour friend\u201d. So try not to let your relationship with his sister muddy the conversation.\n\nThat being said, you going to the funeral is meaningless to Dan. He\u2019s not around to know you\u2019re in attendance. You\u2019d be going to be there for *his family*. And in doing so, you\u2019d sacrifice being there for *your current partner\u2019s family* at an event that\u2019s important to *them*.\n\nYWBTA. Go to the wedding and honor Dan another way at another time.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nPretty simple solution to this.\n\nYou should be going to the wedding and keeping your current relationship.  Because, if you go to the funeral, you may not have a GF to come back to.\n\nDiscuss a compromise with your GF.  Go to the wedding as planned, go visit Dan's family a couple days later to offer your condolences.\n\nTalk to Dan's family and let them know about the prior engagement.  While you deeply regret not being able to make the funeral, ask them if it would be alright if you show up a day or two later.", "YWBTA to your GF and her family, especially since you would be traveling with your ex  and staying with\n her family.  \n\nEven if your current gf forgives you for this l, her family will not.  Your gf will be at a wedding fielding questions about where you are and getting tons of unsolicited advice to dump you.  \n\nIn this situation.  I would go to the wedding, but I would make plans to visit your friend's graveside if he is buried and/or visit the family to offer your condolences.", "NTA for attending the funeral. This was your friend.\n\nIf you rode there with Julia and spent extra time with with her for the additional days, then it may cross a line for your relationship. But attendance to the funeral does not cross the line.", "YTA\n\nIdk brother, this is a terrible decision to make. I don't feel you prioritize your ex, but a friend of yours (aka Dan). It is normal for your girlfriend to be angry at the decision you make, and here is where my decision for YTA here comes. This decision should have been taking with your gf. She is affected from the situation as well. Explain to her, why you think of going to the funeral, maybe she has an idea that can work for both of you. Or point you out something that might have not occur to you. \nLoosing a friend is a terrible thing, and I'm absolutely sorry for this. Tbh YTA is also a bit strong of a statement, but it is so. I suggest you talk to your gf.", "NTA. This guy wasn\u2019t just your ex\u2019s brother, he was your friend. You should ask your gf to look at it that way. While I do think you should go to the funeral, you probably shouldn\u2019t drive down there with your ex or stay with her family. You and Julia aren\u2019t together anymore and your in a committed relationship with someone else. There needs to be boundaries. Also, make sure you personally extend your regrets to your SIL that you can no longer attend her wedding and offer to reimburse her for what she paid for your plate at the reception.", "NAH. This is clearly very important to you, and you have every right to go to that funeral. However, your girlfriend has every right to be upset about you skipping her sister\u2019s wedding and spending 14 hours in the car with your ex. I do think it\u2019s a bit weird that she sees this as you abandoning her, though. Typically people don\u2019t need support at a sibling\u2019s wedding. She\u2019s not even going to be alone, she\u2019ll he surrounded by family. Would she still feel this way if your ex wasn\u2019t involved? Ultimately she\u2019s still not an asshole, but I wonder if there\u2019s other factors contributing to her feeling this way.", "YWNBTA. This isn't about your ex, it's about saying goodbye to a friend you thought of as a brother. This will put (hopefully just a temporary) strain on your relationship but I feel it's important that you go.\n\nEdited for clarity", "YTA\n\nThis funeral is not for your friend it is for the deceased and you are prioritizing your ex and her family over your current girlfriend.\nI mean you can be okay with that, but don't expect your girlfriend to he okay for a emotional car ride with your ex and missing out on a important family event.\nI certainly wouldn't be okay and this is going to posion your relationship.

He said he\u2019s doing that to save money because he\u2019s broke.", "He can't though, as said in the post, he was originally unable to attend due to cost until his deceased friend's parents offered to host him.", "But nowhere in OP\u2019s post did it say that his GF is mad about the staying 2 days with the ex\u2019s family. That\u2019s your own assumption based on what bothers you. Re-read the post.", "He doesn't have any option available to him if he'd like to go to the funeral. The other option is to not go.", "Yes. I don't think you're being unfair. I just don't feel I would set the same. As long as we are up front with expectations, I think boundaries can be a great thing.", "Well, if he\u2019s too broke to go without making his gf uncomfortable then he w shouldn\u2019t go.", "If he can\u2019t afford to go without making his gf uncomfortable, then he shouldn\u2019t go. He can grieve without going to the funeral.", "I\u2019ve read it, and my opinion is that if I was the gf I\u2019d break up with him bc of the time spent with his ex. No where in the post does OP say his gf is breaking up with him, so we\u2019re both talking hypothetically here.", "As I\u2019ve said to many people now, if he cannot afford to go without making his gf uncomfortable, then he should not go. Or, he should be prepared for her to break up with him."]}
