But, I can also understand why your GF would be upset. You\u2019re going with your ex a few days early and staying with your ex Gf\u2019s family who you didn\u2019t get along with in the past to the point of blocking them on your phone. Would you be totally fine with her missing a (hopefully) once in a lifetime family event to be with an ex for a funeral and being with them for days (not just a few hours)? I\u2019m not gonna sugarcoat this, there\u2019s a chance you come back from the funeral with her stuff moved out.", "Okay wait - you and the ex blocked each other because it got so heated but she came by your house after her brother died - and she didn\u2019t know you and the brother were still close ??? How did she know where you lived if you hadn\u2019t been in contact ?? She wants you to go home to the funeral and stay with her extra days ??? Ummm hello if you were blocked for years how did she know where you live ??? None of this adds up. Seems like you might have still been in touch with her ??  Also a funeral is for the living not the deceased .   You already had a phone conversation with her family and visited with her when she showed up at your door by mental telepathy- since y\u2019all had no contact \ud83d\ude44.  You say you want to marry your girlfriend now but you are picking your old girlfriend and her family over her.  This has nothing to do with Dan - he is gone.  You are gonna stay with your ex for days when emotions are everywhere snd think that is not a slap in your girlfriends face.  This is the death shot to your relationship and you will only have yourself to blame.  You could always go back to where Dan is laid to rest and pay your respects at a later time.  Like my brother\u2019s Ranger brothers have done over the years.  Some didn\u2019t go to the funeral so, they have gone by his gravesite and left notes and Ranger coins and etc.  You need to say it like it is - you are choosing your past instead of your future and you will only have yourself to blame when you have to build s new future because of your choices.", "YWNBTA for making this choice.  But, honestly, neither will your GF be when she ends your relationship.  You are making a choice to prioritize an old relationship versus your current one.  Funerals are not for the deceased, they are for the ones left behind.  You will not disparage your friend if you do not go to the funeral.  If you choose the funeral there is a good chance you will be terminally poisoning your relationship.", "What is wrong with you? Get a rental car and motel.", "I kind of understand wanting to go to the funeral, I do not understand the need to be with your ex and her family for multiple days over the course of the funeral. If it really is just about Dan, you should thank them for letting you know and then stop talking to them again. I get why your gf feels like you\u2019re picking your ex over her.\n\nAlso I think it\u2019s shitty to commit to something and then back out.", "The thing is now you are going to spend two days ahead the funeral and be in the same car with alone your ex for at least 14 hours. Can you blame your gf for being insecure? How about you? Will you be okay if your gf does that to you? I dont know man. Unless you can find some way or borrow some money just to fly in, give your last respect to your friend, and fly out ASAP.", "YTA if you go *with* your ex and stay with her family.  That would be inappropriate, if you truly value your 2 year relationship that is close to engagement.\n\nI don't care if you have to pawn something off but find the money to get yourself there and back on your own because traveling with the ex and staying with her family is really distasteful for someone that's supposedly in a committed relationship.\n\nI do hope that once she cools down and thinks about her words, your girlfriend will see that you attending the funeral is necessary for your grieving process.  But again, don't go and spend **days** with your ex if you value your relationship with your girlfriend.", "I\u2019m having trouble with this - are you asking the internet for permission so you feel better about it?  Your friend is gone. You would be going for the living that he left behind. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this changes your girlfriend\u2019s feelings about how serious you are about her.", "I love how you mentioned your \"passionate\" relationship with your ex.  Lmao", "YTA if you travel with your ex on a very emotional trip and expect your gf to be ok with it. Just end things with her so you have a clean break because it\u2019s not like you\u2019re still going to be together with her for long after this trip. Rekindling a relationship with your ex and her family, even if you are not intending this to be a romantic relationship with her, is going to create a whole new dynamic that you can\u2019t expect your gf to be ok with.\n\nIf your gf was canceling on something important with you to spend 14 hours alone in a car with her ex, as well as staying for a number of days with her ex and his family, would you be happy about that?", "YTA - so the problem is staying 2 nights with Julia and her family here. I wouldn\u2019t be upset you went to the funeral but I would be super uncomfortable with you sleeping in the next room as an ex. Even with all the trust in the world it\u2019s a big ask. I think you have the chance to grieve Dan at a later time. His family completely cut you off your relationship with Dan was private. Amelia is your future. I would think carefully and weigh all your choices because I think this could end things with Amelia", "NAH. You were involved with your late friend\u2019s family for years and you cared for him. I feel uncomfortable with his parents stating they would \u201cregard you as family from now on.\u201d You\u2019re not family and you may be setting yourself up for some inappropriate bonding and behavior from them at the funeral and in the future. You\u2019re not the AH whatever you decide but my opinion is that a heartfelt loving letter of sympathy would be more appropriate than dedicating 4 or more days to being in the company of your late friend\u2019s family and your ex girlfriend.", "For the sake of a decision , I have to say that YTA. You can grieve Dan without going to the funeral. Driving on an emotional visit with your ex girlfriend, 2 days early, and staying in her parents house is definitely quite weird, even with the excuse that you are lacking money. I can't put my finger on it, but something just seems a bit off with what you've described.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUltimately the choice is yours.\n\n1. Go to the funeral, you are absolutely not getting engaged to your current girlfriend, who you claim to want to marry\n2. Don't go to the funeral, going there with your EXE'S FAMILY will ultimately ruin any peaceful chances of grieving him that you would have anyway. Then explain to your girlfriend your thought process around the whole thing, she should ultimately understand", "Travelling with your ex and staying with her family for extra days is not appropriate.  You say that you want to marry your GF, you made a commitment to go to her sisters wedding, if you choose to abandon those plans you should be aware that your GF will more than likely soon be your ex.", "Going against the grain here\u2014YWBTA to attend the funeral instead of the wedding.\n\nYou are planning (\u201cclose to\u201d) an engagement with a woman that you live with, who it sounds like has been supporting you through the stress of a medical residency (since you\u2019ve gotten permission from your co-residents to take time off to do this).\n\nAmelia will remember, and likely always be hurt by, this decision to support someone else on the occasion of her sister\u2019s wedding.  You can still remember/memorialize Dan another way\u2014but you should be there *in person* to support Amelia.", "I'm between Soft YWBTA and NAH.  \n\nBut I'm surprised that you didn't seem to have clue that you were supposed to go to a wedding at the same time as the funeral. \n\nIn the end it doesn't matter at all what we say here. All that matters is how important your gf is for you vs the funeral and how strong your relationship are. \n\nThis will for sure make your gf question how tight you are (which your fight showed). And especially since you will go with your ex. For your gf it's not a trip you're doing on your own for an old friend, it's a trip your doing with your ex!  I think it would be a lot different if you ex wasn't involved in this. But now you need to totally depend on her since you can't afford this.", "NAH but if I was your GF this would be the end of the relationship for me.\n\nFunerals are for the living. Driving down with her and staying extra time with the family is what swings it for me. That has nothing to do with Dan and is all about the ex. And you are choosing your ex's family over your GF's.\n\nIf you can go to the funeral without driving with your ex or staying with her family you would be NTA because then it is about your friend.", "YTA- you\u2019re spending 2 days with ex before funeral. You could borrow $, go to the wedding and fly to the funeral. \n\nDefinitely the AH", "Sorry mate, but YTA. It\u2019s terrible your exes brother died and that you\u2019d had a good relationship, but ditching your partner for that is a really bad look. I\u2019m usually all for funerals over other things but this one I think you\u2019re wrong. You are dedicating to your past instead of your future family and that\u2019s not right. It\u2019s sad he died but family couldn\u2019t attend my dads funeral for less intense reasons and so I just think it\u2019s wholly inappropriate. Problem is you\u2019ve made decisions now, you should have immediately explained to your ex that you will be sending thoughts and best wishes and under other circumstances you would go, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019d have understood, but your gf isn\u2019t going to forgive you for picking your exes family over hers. That\u2019s that.\n\nI think if you and your ex had kids together I could understand because it would be for the kids sake, but generally exes should be in the past, you kept your friendship secret because it wouldn\u2019t be accepted by them and now they\u2019re pulling you back into the fold.. just not good.", "NAH here, but this may put a strain on or end your current relationship.", "If you choose to go to the wedding you could do a few things instead. \n\nPerhaps go visit Dan\u2019s parents now before the funeral to chat about Dan. Arrange for a bouquet or wreath via a florist to arrive at the funeral home.", "NAH. I can fully understand wanting to go to grieve the loss of your friend. Even if you went to the wedding instead I could only imagine how horrible it would be to be around celebrations while you\u2019re grieving. However, your gf has a right to be uncomfortable with the arrangements of you travelling and staying with your ex for the funeral and missing an event with her family that you\u2019d already agreed to. It sounds like you\u2019ve made up with your exes family so even with all the trust in the world it\u2019s still uncomfortable. Sorry you\u2019re in this situation.", "Info: do you have to stay and travel with your ex? I don't think you're an A H but I think you're not really thinking this through. I think this will seriously hurt your current relationship.", "The issue is travelling with your ex and staying with the family imo. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "YTA if you take up the offer to go with your ex and stay with her family. This should not be an offer you would ever consider, it\u2019s inappropriate and your gf isn\u2019t \u201cjealous\u201d, this is something that is crossing her boundaries of what she is and isn\u2019t comfortable with. If you cross this boundary it will either end your relationship or set it up for failure. \n\nIf you choose to go to this funeral, which you have every right to do, it must NOT involve communication or spending time with your ex beyond the funeral event itself. Go by yourself, stay by yourself. If you can\u2019t afford it, don\u2019t go. The staying with ex gf option is not an option. Your gf cannot be upset if you go to a funeral for a close friend and miss the wedding. She absolutely has a right to be upset if you travel and stay with your ex gf. Very inappropriate and uncomfortable for her regardless of how much she trusts you. You respect her boundaries or you violate them. Your choice.", "YTA your ex girlfriend invited you on a long drive just the two of you and you would be traveling with her a couple of days before the funeral so you\u2019ll be spending the whole time with her. If you don\u2019t think your are prioritizing your ex girlfriend over your current one you are delusional. Concentrate on reviving the very passionate relationship you used to have with your ex because you just ended your current relationship", "YTA if you drive with the ex and spend days with her and her family. You and ex are going to be very emotionally raw, reminiscing about the old days, etc. That\u2019s leaving the door wide open for emotional bonding to walk right back in. I can see going to the funeral but NOT spending all the extra time with her and her family. Leave them in the past where they belong.", "It sounds like Dan wasn\u2019t \u201cyour ex\u2019s brother\u201d but rather \u201cyour friend\u201d. So try not to let your relationship with his sister muddy the conversation.\n\nThat being said, you going to the funeral is meaningless to Dan. He\u2019s not around to know you\u2019re in attendance. You\u2019d be going to be there for *his family*. And in doing so, you\u2019d sacrifice being there for *your current partner\u2019s family* at an event that\u2019s important to *them*.\n\nYWBTA. Go to the wedding and honor Dan another way at another time.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nPretty simple solution to this.\n\nYou should be going to the wedding and keeping your current relationship.  Because, if you go to the funeral, you may not have a GF to come back to.\n\nDiscuss a compromise with your GF.  Go to the wedding as planned, go visit Dan's family a couple days later to offer your condolences.\n\nTalk to Dan's family and let them know about the prior engagement.  While you deeply regret not being able to make the funeral, ask them if it would be alright if you show up a day or two later.", "YWBTA to your GF and her family, especially since you would be traveling with your ex  and staying with\n her family.  \n\nEven if your current gf forgives you for this l, her family will not.  Your gf will be at a wedding fielding questions about where you are and getting tons of unsolicited advice to dump you.  \n\nIn this situation.  I would go to the wedding, but I would make plans to visit your friend's graveside if he is buried and/or visit the family to offer your condolences.", "NTA for attending the funeral. This was your friend.\n\nIf you rode there with Julia and spent extra time with with her for the additional days, then it may cross a line for your relationship. But attendance to the funeral does not cross the line.", "YTA\n\nIdk brother, this is a terrible decision to make. I don't feel you prioritize your ex, but a friend of yours (aka Dan). It is normal for your girlfriend to be angry at the decision you make, and here is where my decision for YTA here comes. This decision should have been taking with your gf. She is affected from the situation as well. Explain to her, why you think of going to the funeral, maybe she has an idea that can work for both of you. Or point you out something that might have not occur to you. \nLoosing a friend is a terrible thing, and I'm absolutely sorry for this. Tbh YTA is also a bit strong of a statement, but it is so. I suggest you talk to your gf.", "NTA. This guy wasn\u2019t just your ex\u2019s brother, he was your friend. You should ask your gf to look at it that way. While I do think you should go to the funeral, you probably shouldn\u2019t drive down there with your ex or stay with her family. You and Julia aren\u2019t together anymore and your in a committed relationship with someone else. There needs to be boundaries. Also, make sure you personally extend your regrets to your SIL that you can no longer attend her wedding and offer to reimburse her for what she paid for your plate at the reception.", "NAH. This is clearly very important to you, and you have every right to go to that funeral. However, your girlfriend has every right to be upset about you skipping her sister\u2019s wedding and spending 14 hours in the car with your ex. I do think it\u2019s a bit weird that she sees this as you abandoning her, though. Typically people don\u2019t need support at a sibling\u2019s wedding. She\u2019s not even going to be alone, she\u2019ll he surrounded by family. Would she still feel this way if your ex wasn\u2019t involved? Ultimately she\u2019s still not an asshole, but I wonder if there\u2019s other factors contributing to her feeling this way.", "YWNBTA. This isn't about your ex, it's about saying goodbye to a friend you thought of as a brother. This will put (hopefully just a temporary) strain on your relationship but I feel it's important that you go.\n\nEdited for clarity", "YTA\n\nThis funeral is not for your friend it is for the deceased and you are prioritizing your ex and her family over your current girlfriend.\nI mean you can be okay with that, but don't expect your girlfriend to he okay for a emotional car ride with your ex and missing out on a important family event.\nI certainly wouldn't be okay and this is going to posion your relationship.

I can\u2019t imagine I would be a very good wedding date either. I would hope I had a supportive partner who understands why I needed to grieve in a way that includes going to the funeral, and why I\u2019m not up for a wedding. \n\nAs the partner, I would also be really disappointed if my almost fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t come with me to celebrate my sibling and spend time with my family, and instead was spending days with their ex, while staying at the ex\u2019s parents\u2019 house. I\u2019m not a jealous person, but that is too much for me. It\u2019s one thing to tell my family they didn\u2019t come because they are attending the funeral of a close friend and they send their regards. Totally understandable. It\u2019s another to tell them that they\u2019re staying with their ex & their ex\u2019s family while attending the funeral. Even if it\u2019s really just about the funeral, it starts to feel like a lot more in that scenario. It\u2019s hurtful and would take a lot to move past. \n\nIf attending the funeral is really important to you, I would recommend talking about it more with your partner. You may also want to point out how it wouldn\u2019t be fair to their sibling for you to be grieving at their wedding, as it would dampen the \u2018celebratory\u2019 vibe. I would also prioritize finding your own means of transportation, your own place to stay, and would be in and out for the funeral (not staying all weekend). Yes, it may be expensive, but what is your relationship worth? \n\nPrepare clear boundaries with the ex & their family (e.g. no solo comforting time) and share those boundaries with your partner. Also be prepared for your partner to still not be okay with it. Life is long. This is a comparability issue. What will you do if they\u2019re still not okay with you going?

That even if you missed his funeral the fact that it's the same day as the wedding means that you would be focused on your grief during the wedding instead of having fun and being supportive of your GF.

Sounds to me like a recipe for disaster. What if you go to that town in a couple of weeks, visit the gravesite with your girlfriend? That wouldn\u2019t suffice?", "I am not liking the way this is going in the comments, tbh. People, you absolutely get to make your own choices, and no one is disputing that. What you DON\u2019T get to do is what a lot of the commenters are doing: dictating how others feel about those decisions (by calling it a \u201cred flag\u201d that his girlfriend is very upset). It\u2019s his girlfriend\u2019s decision on whether HIS decision means that she doesn\u2019t want to continue the relationship? \n\nI would NOT be okay with this if I were in her shoes, either. Not attending the funeral instead of the wedding so much, but staying in the house with his ex and her family for DAYS. A family that obviously and not very subtly wants him to become a more active presence in their lives. I\u2019d nope out.", "I think YWBTA if you go. You are choosing between your future and your past. If you make the choice to break the commitment to your near fianc\u00e9e, I think your relationship will suffer a potentially unrecoverable setback.

No staying with the ex IL.  No car rides with the ex.  Hotel room.   Rent a car.  Then if they aren't on the exact same day get yourself to the wedding.  ESH.  Spend some money.  Save your relationship(s).   Be good to yourself.  You'll be able to pay it back eventually as a soon to be doctor.", "Unpopular opinion apparently, but YWBTA for a few reasons:\n\n1) whether you like it or not you would be prioritizing your ex and her family over your current partner\u2019s. Attending the funeral no matter how you slice it is attending your ex\u2019s family event and skipping your current gf\u2019s family event. No matter how many warm feelings or goodwill gestures your ex\u2019s family is sharing with you now, there\u2019s little to no reason to interact with them moving forward. They live far away, you\u2019re not in the same age group with them. So what\u2019s in it for you? Are her parents former caregivers, mentors, confidants? Something else? If not, what reason do you have for connecting with them moving forward? The only answer that I would assume as your gf is that you\u2019re still into your ex.\n\n2) There are other ways you can remember and respect your friend besides going to his funeral. Only you know your relationship with him and can/should determine what\u2019s appropriate, but there have been plenty of funerals that I\u2019ve had to miss because of scheduling conflicts, finances, or competing interests, where I\u2019ve personally had to come up with something that felt right for me and that loved one\u2019s memory.\n\n3)You\u2019ve already RSVP\u2019d to your SIL\u2019s wedding. They\u2019ve paid money to have you as a guest at their event and this close to the event it is unlikely that they can replace you or get their money back. This one is admittedly on the lesser reasons, but you shouldn\u2019t overlook it either\n\n4) Has your partner meet your friend who passed away? If not, have you him mentioned to her frequently in the past? If not, she would have no impression of how close the two of you were. \n\n5) Your asking your gf to trust you to go with your ex alone, stay at her home alone, and saying you would absolutely trust her if it was the other way around. What is there for her to gain in this scenario? What is there for her to lose? Sorry that you think your gf should blindly trust you absolutely, but that\u2019s just not how human beings work. She\u2019ll fear the worst and there won\u2019t be a whole lot there to show her otherwise.\n\nPut simply, it\u2019s best to sit this one out and go to your potential SIL\u2019s wedding. Nothing but harm can/will come to your current relationship by going to your friend\u2019s funeral. You stand to gain very little from attending the funeral beyond strengthening the relationships you have with your ex-GF and her family, which is perfectly fine if what you want is to rekindle that love interest. Just know that it would be at the expense of your current one.", "At this point it's coming down to picking a family. Which do you choose - the one you said goodbye to already, or the new one? You can't have both. Dan is dead, unfortunately, and will not know if you were at his funeral or not. But your ex will know, and your new girlfriend will know.

A lot of comments are completely disregarding OP\u2019s grief for the death of a close friend and focusing on his ex. I get that everyone is insecure sometimes, but putting your own feelings of jealousy above the healing of a partner grieving the loss of a loved one is incredibly selfish. If you can\u2019t trust your partner around their ex, then you don\u2019t trust your partner to be faithful.", "Are y'all actually this unhinged to be defending the girlfriend? He's not prioritizing a \"past relationship\" over his current one. He's MOURNING the loss of his close friend, who he saw as a little brother. \n\nThe girlfriend is weird to see you wanting to attend his funeral as time to spend with your ex. If she does break up with you she's doing you a favor.", "YTA. Amelia is your present and future, she should be the priority. If you come to the realization that she isn\u2019t then fine, go to the funeral and ditch her, but at least be honest about it with her.", "You'd be a HUGE asshole if you went to the funeral. You say you want to marry your gf. So for the rest of your lives at family events they will all remember how you ditched her SISTERS wedding. You're gonna spend a 7 hour car ride (14 hours there and back) with your ex you were with for 5 years?!\nFuck no bro.\nIf you do that I hope your GF leaves your shit out on the street.", "Please update us on your choice and the outcome.", "I think you both need to compromise. From your comments it seems like going to the funeral is really important to you and I don't think you're TA for wanting to go. The issue is traveling and staying with your ex and her family. That seems to be the boundary that your gf seems to have issues with. Honestly, that does seem a bit too intimate, especially since you had bad blood only a few days ago, so I can understand why she might be upset by it, especially given the timing of it all. Had you lost a different close friend, would your gf still expect you to come to the wedding instead? That would make her TA in my opinion. \n\nIMO your ex should not even be playing a role in this dilemma. I think it's a bad idea to accept a ride with her where you will be in a car together for 14 hours in addition to staying with her and her family for several days. Not only because it's causing tension in your current relationship but also because that could turn sideways real fast. Emotions will be all over the place, sure they seem fine with you now but what if something happens and that changes? If things go south, what's your backup plan? Because this arrangement seems like a recipe for disaster.\n\nYou're NTA for wanting to go to the funeral even if it means you'll miss SIL's wedding but find alternate arrangements.", "Why an either or? If both these events mean something to you, make it work! Go to your GF\u2019s wedding and then drive with your GF to attend the funeral. Long, weekend that is sure to be exhausting but that\u2019s just prioritizing. It\u2019s what I would do and expect from my significant other.", "I disagree with this, while I get that this is not a great situation for his gf and I wouldn\u2019t want to be in the same situation, his friend died and OP is unable to go bcuz of financial reasons by himself just on the day of the funeral. And calling him names and her friends and family is strictly a NTA rating imo. She needs more empathy.", "This was the first thing that I noticed lmao.", "The fact that he described the deceased primarily as his ex\u2019s brother and not his friend is also really telling tbh", "Gaping plot holes. All of a Sudden everyone is thanking him for being close with Dan for years and helping him through depression taking his word alone?", "Funerals are for the living, and OP is living, so the funeral is for him too. His friend died, a friend who he felt a brotherly bond to, and he should be allowed to grieve him in the way he wants to.\n\nPeople are filling in so many blanks and making so many assumptions here. When my brother died, I heard from people I hadn't heard from in years, and even someone I was not on speaking terms with. They had no objective beyond helping me grieve. That's the nature of death, and people assigning all sorts of ulterior motives to the ex without any actual evidence... seems very paranoid to me.\n\nI trust my partner enough that I would be completely fine with this situation. Do y'all not trust your partners? It stinks that these two events are happening at the same time, but making this situation into a \"you're choosing your ex over you current partner\" feels so wrong to me, and I would never put my partner in a situation where they have to feel guilty for attending their close friend's funeral, especially because of a wedding.\n\nPerhaps I'm biased, though, because I can't stand weddings, lol.", "She is absolutely an asshole for dumping someone for mourning a friend.", "I hope op reads this comment.", "Support goes both ways", "He\u2019s not going for the other family, he\u2019s going for himself.", "Absolute this.

I also think he should go to the funeral, but I also tried his GF's shoes on and... well, being at my sister's wedding without my boyfriend would obviously make me very sad for a number of reasons, mostly unrelated to the ex, but that would obviously play a role as \"the cherry on top\". \n\n\nDifficult situation all around, I'd say it's a lose-lose... I assume it's too late now to postpone the funeral, otherwise that might have been the only save for this big mess.", "If this is that important. Arrange the money, and go to just the funeral.

I know you are mourning your friend's death, but please separate that out from what you think you owe these people. You owe them nothing, they are not your responsibility.

The pressure this family is putting on you is not fair or appropriate.", "How did the ex also find him,  a hospital resident, at home when she just dropped by when residents barely leave the hospital plus at a convenient time when his live in girlfriend was not home ??? So many holes.", "This still doesn\u2019t make sense and YWBTA, not for going to the funeral, but for the how and how long you are going for.  If you have had no contact, and Julia had no idea about your relationship with her brother, why would she even contact you in the first place.  Also, why wouldn\u2019t she just call you, email or text.  It makes more sense for your friend to give her your email or phone number, not address.  Heck, I don\u2019t even know the address of over 95% of my friends.  Also, if your family is in the same town, why not relay information via them.  I\u2019ve had the misfortune of planning a funeral for a close loved one.  If I had to inform someone of their passing, I called. I did not have the emotional bandwidth to drive six hours to tell someone, especially someone who I did not know was close my loved one.  If she came in person to tell you, Julia was looking for emotional support for herself, which is not your role in her life anymore. I also have known a lot of medical residents.  While their wages are not great, I\u2019m certain they could scrape up enough money for quick in and out flight for the same day on a budget airline, which is only an hour flight if the drive is about six to seven hours.  If you are willing to miss your future SIL wedding for this funeral, I\u2018m not sure why you wouldn\u2019t charge your credit card to get a cheap flight or rent a car yourself or even borrow.  Going to the funeral I can understand.  Spending days in close contact with your \u201cno-contact\u201d ex is not understandable.", "I think you still have feelings for your ex.

Resentment is the silent killer of relationships.

If they can\u2019t come to an agreement, this situation will poison the relationship either way.

That is the emotional cheating and why, yes, they will break up.", "I think the point of saying they for the living here is that OP said they don't like the living people that will be there. OP is choosing to hang out with people he doesn't like over keeping a commitment they made to their GF.\n\nSo, GFs feelings are perfectly valid. She is going to be embarrassed to be alone and worried about what OP is up to. Not to mention, if OP is willing to drop this commitment, what else are they willing to drop? Trust concerns are valid.\n\nBut then from OPs perspective the death of his friend turned enemies into kin. They are all suffering the same and so he wants to be with them during the mourning. Also perfectly valid and normal feelings to have.\n\nNAH seems fine to me.", "Imagine being at a wedding, surrounded by happy people, when someone you loved recently died.", "Jealousy isn't a good look on anyone.  It is nothing but ego & has no value at all", "I dont agree that he is prioritizing an old relationship - OP lost a friend who was very important to him", "She could indeed say that to the extended family. But as her sister already knows he wants to go to his ex's brother's funeral, sister will probably spill the beans at some point.\n\nMoreover, she has already told her friends in addition to the sister so I thinks she will tell all her family as well. So even if she ultimately accepts OP decision, this could damage OP image for a long time.\n\nEdit: my point is not saying OP shouldn't go to the funeral to get closure regarding his friend but he has to know that this action could have consequences for his current relationship.", "Then why did he spend some much time talking about how the family wants him there and how important they are to him?", "They had a very passionate relationship whereas his current relationship is...nice.", "If you take the ex out I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a conflict at all.  Amelia said he\u2019s leaving her alone so he can \u201creconnect with the ex\u201d her issue is him spending 14 hours alone in the car, plus days at the families house.  What\u2019s he going to do for days before the funeral with ex and her parents in their home? Reconnect.  That\u2019s clearly a very intimate and emotional experience.\n\nIf he figured out a way to get himself there alone, attend the funeral and say goodbye to his friend and pass along his condolences to the family and than head home, she would likely be okay with it.", "It\u2019s the ex situation. If it was just a normal friend it probably wouldn\u2019t be a big deal.", "Imagine thinking having reasonable boundaries is cOnTrOLLiNg. \ud83e\udd23", "I think he is comforted by going to the funeral of his friend. But, you're right, if you can't trust someone not to cheat on you in any situation, then breaking up is the way to go. I just dont this he's the asshole. Again, for me, I can't babysit my bf like a child, I just dont have the energy. I feel, if someone is gonna cheat, then they will no matter the situation. Thanks for responding politely! Have a great weekend!", "jealousy is an emotion. it has no morality, like anger. actions have morality. she\u2019s well within her rights as a human to have \u201cugly\u201d feelings.", "Yeah grief has a funny effect on people. I bet girlfriend is suspicious that OPs gonna let the grief get to him and shack up with the ex - that\u2019s what I\u2019d be afraid of.", "Op decided to go to the funeralas he considers this to be the correct action for him. He s not in the mood to celebrate and go to the wedding ffs . The gf needs to stop being so selfish and empathize with him too.", "I think you mean that You, SpaceyJaycey, can mourn without going to a funeral.  You have no call over the way others mourn.", "Then she should help him with that instead of doing what she is doing now. Try to make a plan for him to go in a war she is comfortable with. But instead she doesn't want him to go to the funeral of a super close friend.", "based on your comments your personality seems to cause a lot of problems", "He's prioritizing one of his best friends", "...the funeral is seven hours away. it was going to be at least an overnight stay for op even if he had his own transport.", "I\u2019d bet money that it will happen. I\u2019ve seen people do that and try to justify it with \u201cbut I was grieving! I couldn\u2019t help myself!", "If he want to remain in a relationship with his SO he shouldn\u2019t see her as irrelevant.", "Not to mention, SEVEN hours away from where she lives\u2026", ">That\u2019s boundary stopping for anyone.\n\nLOL, what? Please, don't speak for \"anyone\". Plenty of us trust our partners and aren't controlled by jealousy. Yikes.\n\nSome of us are even...*gasp*..friends with our exes!", "What a perfect time to hook up with your ex\u2026 at her brother\u2019s funeral under the same roof as her parents lmao.\n\nY\u2019all are adding so much extra shit in this made up scenario. If he cheats, leave. He has been this transparent thus far. This preemptive breakup shit is so dumb. At least let the guy commit the crime first.", "It's not boundary stopping for me (together with my husband for 8 years). If you think your partner would or could cheat on you if you \"let\" them be alone with another person, then don't date them. It's pretty simple--if you can't trust them, then don't be with them.", "Wouldn\u2019t be an issue for me. It seems you\u2019re rather insecure to expect that your partner would cheat with his ex while she\u2018s BURYING HER BROTHER.", "\"She was there for me! I was having a really hard time and she comforted me - by putting her mouth on my penis.\"", "I think maybe he didn't title it that way cuz the biggest problem here (the issue for his GF) is that his friend Dan happens to be his ex's brother", "Agreed. The SO and their wishes are very relevant. At the point of being ready for engagement, you are a pair. Your decisions affect each other.\n\nThis situation sucks. I can understand why OP wants to go to the funeral but I can also understand why his SO would want him there. This is a NAH situation.", "Except it has a lot to do with his ex who he will be with the whole time.", "I think you can be the most secure person, about yourself, and the relationship, but this situation could change that. OP is going to be in a car alone for hours with an ex. He described the relationship with the ex as passionate. They started this relationship in HS, they are probably each other\u2019s first love. That\u2019s alot for the gf to deal with, on top of being upset he isn\u2019t at the wedding", "But do you want someone attending your wedding who is clearly not in the mood for fun and celebration stuff, because he/she is grieving? \n\nShould this person put up a fake smile and fake happy face just for others? This is insane. OP is NTA here.", "What expenses are they offering to pay? The ex is letting him join her when she drives down there herself and her parents are letting him stay in a room for a couple days. Neither of those things cost them extra money.", "I wouldn't want to be in a relationship where my partner wouldn't even try to help me go to a funeral of a friend who is like family to me.", "Seriously, this entire thread is very r/AreTheStraightsOK", "It seems like the situation is boundary-crossing for OP\u2019s girlfriend, too, though.", "Would i personally? No. That doesn't mean his gf doesn't have the right to be upset that he's spending several days with his ex's family instead of attending her family's big event.", "Ok. But I was positing an alternate explanation that, as it turns out from OP's comments, was accurate. The family found out after death. A lot of people also feel that death notifications should be done in person.", ">I don\u2019t have trust issues at all actually.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Also, idk if you realize this but a lot of cheating happens when people are in emotional, traumatic states.\n\nHmm.", "Yeah gf could give him her car, so that he doesn't need to go two days earlier and maybe some extra money so he can afford a small room where he can sleep and drive back in the morning after the funeral, because this is the only reason he has to drive with his ex gf and \"has\" to sleep at his ex gf parents house.", "But then how would they be able to call the man an asshole?"]}
