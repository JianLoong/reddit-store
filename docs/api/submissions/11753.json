It's for low income families but at the moment it's just me. I'm a music student with both bass and drums. I use my furthest bedroom as my music room where I practice. The way the floorplan is set up the apartment to my left mirrors mine but the one to my right is opposite and only one floor. I've lived here for the last 6 years and have gotten along with my neighbors. \n\nLast month a new couple moved in the left one apartment with a newborn. Maybe a week old at that point so now a month. I'm unsure how they had it setup for the first two weeks but two week ago I was practicing on the drums and was interrupted by pounding on the door because I woke the baby up. I apologized and double checked my sound proofing (padding but also have a drum booth) but found no gaps. The sound is muffled but loud enough to be heard in the mirrored room but nowhere else in the other apartment. I know that based on that guy that lived there before. A few days later it happened again while practicing and I noticed I could hear the baby crying almost perfectly. I got in a screaming match with the husband and we got the apartment manager to come out and settle it. Turns out they put the kid's crib right on the other side of the wall where my drums setup is. The couple said that was the only room with the amount of natural light they wanted for the kid. They told me to move the room I used for music and I agreed as long as they footed the bill for the sound proofing and they called me an asshole. Now they have been calling in none stop noise complaints.\n\nEdited to say the couple actually agreed the only room they could hear the drums in was that one room. However they like the lighting in there so they won't move the baby. The neighbors on the other side were surprised to find out I had drums.

You've made some with soundproofing, and if they aren't willing to compromise location, there's other areas that are easy enough to arrange.

What is so freaking special about \"the light\" that they can't move the stupid crib a couple of feet one way or the other and go back to how things were before they jammed the kid up against the only conduction point in the building?

They would get the exact same sound level if I took everything, padding included, out and put a TV in it's place", "I do believe I lost a lot of people when I said drums in an apartment. My sound proofing consists of a layer of sound dampening padding on the existing wall, 2x4+plywood build outs to create a second wall and floor with sound proofing insulation added, rubber cushioning, and another layer of sound dampening pads.

If I play in the room you can barely hear it at my front door. I built double walls with padding just for it. The booth is the same both used in theaters to muffle the harsh drum sounds. If I start playing music from my computer in a non soundproof room it would be louder. \n\nEdited to add I did tell them the room is padded.

It's really weird how they never heard it until two weeks later when they placed the crib in that exact spot directly behind the drum booth. So of the month of this happening the baby didn't wake up until session 14ish? The room is sound proofed and the neighbors agreed you couldn't even hear it in any other room besides that one.

Like you can hear it but can't really make it out.\n\n\nThese responses make me wonder if your hearing is already somewhat impaired from your music practice because there is nothing 'muffled' about a 'loud youtube video playing in the same room.' A loud youtube video is loud,  not 'muffled. Are you saying the parents shouldn't be complaining about the equivalent of *a loud YouTube video* playing in their baby's nursery while it's sleeping / trying to sleep?? If someone in the same room as me is playing a youtube video, I can absolutely hear it. I really think you should consider getting your hearing checked. \n\n\nAside from that though, expecting to play drums in an apartment without complaint is a pretty big ask. I know and have known tons of drummers in my lifetime and every. single. one. of them played in their soundproofed basement or their soundproofed garage and were sensitive about the time of day they played.  If they didn't have a basement or garage, they used a friend 's or band mate's or a studio.\n\n\nYou could see if the neighbors would be willing to compromise on having a time schedule for you to play. Like, only between X o'clock and Y o'clock or something. How often are you playing? An hour or 2 a day at a consistent time or just whenever you feel like it for as long as you feel like it, day in and day out?", "If that\u2019s the case, then I think NTA. When you live in an apartment, you have to accept some level of noise during the day. It\u2019s not fair for them to expect you to rearrange your apartment because they want their baby to have the most natural light possible.", "I shouldn't be able to hear my neighbour's TV at all. I live in an apartment with absolutely crappy soundproofing, this building is super old, and I NEVER hear my neighbours' TVs. I do hear my other neighbour's piano, which is a rhythm instrument, and no matter what soundproofing they use, it's disruptive. \n\nYour neighbours should be able to listen to their OWN TV or have a nap in their own home, at pretty much any time of day, without having to listen to whatever is going on in YOUR home. If you live in an apartment - and I say this as both a former percussionist AND someone with a severe migraine-related disorder who is now housebound - you should not be playing rhythm instruments at home. They're disruptive and intrusive. Get a studio space, or rent somewhere that does not share walls with other people's homes. The fact that your old neighbour was willing to put up with it doesn't actually make it okay.", "Isn't it possible to move the sound booth to a different wall in the room?", "why is the booth on a shared wall to begin with? if it's a simple as moving a crib it's as simple as moving your booth. \nor only your needs are considered in this scenario?", "I'm puzzled.  Per your post: \"The couple said that was the only room with the amount of natural light they wanted...\"   So they wanted NO natural light?  Weird, but whatever floats their boat.  Either way, I still think they should just shift the crib.", "Alright, it sounds like you've got the soundproofing locked down, but resulting to getting into a shouting match still makes ESH. \n\nIt's more than a bit silly that they'd rather their baby be woken up than get a little less sunlight.", "It really doesn\u2019t matter. They shouldn\u2019t have to arrange their apartment based on the noise you\u2019re going to make. Maybe they don\u2019t want loud noise in their bedroom or office, either.", "How can you hear yourself playing the drums while simultaneously in the neighbor\u2019s apartment? How do you know what the light is like but supposedly the landlord doesn\u2019t? \n\nSomething isn\u2019t adding up here.", "You sound like the kind of person who shouldn't be living in an apartment.", "NTA\n\nIf you remove the padding and change the room\u2019s purpose, it could still be an issue for the baby. You could end up putting a tv against that wall or a bed. Either one of those could result in noise that would disturb the baby. And *you* would then be bothered by the baby\u2019s cries.\n\nYour neighbors are in the position where they can make a change on their end to improve the situation. It would also be more courteous on their part to *not* put an infant\u2019s crib against a shared wall.", "Baby needs vitamin D.. its not entiled to not want your baby to have a vitamin D lack in Winter (in summer 15 min outside are enaugh)  they are not doing this to anger you! maybe ask them to tell you when the baby sleeps and work arround it", "His rights to his apartment end when they start infringing on other renters rights.", "Seems like you must be hard of hearing. In order to be a considerate neighbor you wouldn't put a TV on a shared wall.\n\n>Just for clarification you're saying a YouTube video in the same room as you that you can't make out what is being said is unacceptable noise level.\n\nYes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Just because you can't tell what's being said doesn't mean it's not audible.", "Well\u2026this is the comment people need to read. I was not sure how I felt. But NTA if you are living there to care for your mom. Is the drum set in your bedroom?", "But you said at the moment it's just you? \n\nI don't think it's wise to get in a screaming match with the neighbors at your mom's apartment and jeopardize her housing over your loud music.", "Um, because they can hear it in that room and it\u2019s part of their apartment? You\u2019re lucky your previous neighbors didn\u2019t complain.", "You're still AH for having that setup in an apartment. You need to play it at Guitar Center, your school, or rent a spot. You're asking that they give up sleeping quarters so you can play music.", "I\u2019m interested to know how you know what your drums sound like in the other apartment. However, even with sound proofing if there\u2019s a part of the noise and vibration that disturbs the other room I would say it\u2019s beyond \u201cnormal\u201d apartment noise.", "This is reasonable. NTA", ">he did offer to move the drum room\n\nMove that shit to a studio. Sincerely, a longtime musician.", "Still, you\u2019re in an apartment. Hearing it is enough, It\u2019s really rough. I would personally switch to an electronic or even a mesh while at home and save the full percussion for in the music building where you won\u2019t have to worry about anything", "Hi...you sound like someone who can\u2019t figure out why this is triggering.   \nIt is not normal to expect to play this kind of instrument in an apartment complex. Ever!\\`\n\nDoes that help?", "Dude *don\u2019t* accept the A H judgements. You have gone above and beyond with your soundproofing (source:am a musician and recording engineer), the new neighbors are being absurd, and after reading the whole thread, everyone voting against you are the same type of self centered idiot as your neighbors and/or not bothering to understand the context. \n\nYou are absolutely within your rights to make a reasonable amount of noise during the day in your own home, and with the setup you describe you are absolutely keeping it to a more than reasonable volume. \n\nP.S. I didn\u2019t specifically see any mention of it in your booth setup, and judging by everything else you\u2019re likely already on top of this, but if you do end up needing to go further you can make a cheap and effective isolation platform for your amp and kit with plywood resting on tennis balls. Use a hole saw smaller than the ball diameter to stop the whole thing rolling around and you\u2019re most of the way to no vibration transfer.", "This is honestly a really good point. I was wondering why OP kept comparing things that are wildly different sound wise. A hearing issue would explain a lot, including why he doesn\u2019t seem to think it\u2019s loud when the neighbors do.", "I will definitely get my ears checked. I used those examples from things that were happening during the time of the sound test and it's what I grabbed into first. The room is soundproofed as much as I possibly could and I attempted to over engineer every detail. I only play between the hours of noon and 4pm and at this point I'm willing to narrow it down to a specific time. When it's just homework such as memorizing I tend to only spend an hour actually playing however when that demonstration comes up I max it up to two or three. But it's rare I have three hours uninterrupted.", "Fair enough. Although I can in fact hear their TV", "How portable do you think a sound booth is?", "The booth is built into the secondary wall to account for the vibration. It can totally be moved but without that anchor the sound will go down at that wall but the chance of vibration greatly increases.", "Thats what they told the landlord. There's is no natural light. There's no window.", "Their isn't any direct sunlight in that room. That's why I chose that one in my apartment for the music room. No windows for sound to escape. They said that the light is set up in a natural way. The shouting match came about because I found out they put the crib in the same spot as my booth and told them even if they wanted to keep that room moving the crib from that exact spot would solve their problem", "That's what I'm trying to get across. It's not loud noise. If I were to remove everything, padding included, and put a TV against that wall we would have the same issue.", "Well by that logic op doesn\u2019t have to arrange her apartment based on the baby", "And why should Op, who has been there longer, need to re arrange their apartment based on the neighbors desire to have the baby in that specific room, against that specific wall?", "Maybe he doesn't want to screaming baby next to his music room, but that's stuff you have to deal with when you live in an apartment building at least he's doing everything he can to limit the disruption as much as possible", "We actually tested this in 3 rounds. Landlord was there. He was called the second time and was there for the tests. \n\nRound one: same as with that Old neighbor I had a friend come and play so I could hear it in multiple rooms myself. I did instruct him to play as loud as he could. Landlord was here for these current neighbors \n\nRound two: landlord present again we did a sound level test and I spoke with him about the drum set and times and everything\n\nRound three: I played and recorded the sound in different places. \n\nAlso he knows the light situation. He also asked them why the baby had to be in that room. He can't dictate where they choose to have their baby but he can highly suggest moving it away from that wall. Yes he knows about the wall and in an unscientific test pressed his ear against it and gave the ok. I don't know if he understood what they meant by the lighting being natural in that room but he also didn't press the issue aside from suggesting they move the crib and asking me to try an add extra padding in that spot", "And why is that? I actually don't make anymore noise than any other family in that complex. Yes I've checked", "like it or not, there is a reasonable level of noise that can be heard from other apartments. i can definitely hear my neighbors when they are having a family dinner (loud talkers).", "A) He can hear their TV in his apartment.\nB) They admit the only room they can hear his drums in is the room right next to the drum room, they only keep the kid in there because \"They like the lighting\"\nC) it's to be expected that neighbours can make some noise during the day\nD)If he doesn't like to hear the kid crying at whatever time would they not be infringing on his rights?", "And how loud do you think a screaming infant will be? At all hours of the night. \n\nI\u2019ll take living next to a band instead of someone with an infant all day.", "No. It's in the third room that doubled as an office/sitting room. My bedroom is next to it.", "Yes at the moment it's just me. Mom has some extended Dr appointments she has to go through. Will be home soon though.", "Also very true about the screaming match. Not proud of the moment myself and that's what led to this post", "The previous neighbor didn't complain because it's not a loud noise level. If I took all the padding out and put a TV against that same wall we would have the same issue.", "Even if I didn't have that set up or I took everything out and replaced it with a TV against that wall we would still have the same problem. It's actually less than that. I built the second better insulated walls because I can hear their TV in my bedroom because it's against the same wall as my bed", "She can do whatever she wants in her apartment", "I checked with the old neighbor and this time when the landlord got involved we checked the noise level again. That's also how I know where the baby crib is.", "As a housebound person with intractable migraine who would be fetal on the floor if he were my neighbour - and a former percussionist -  I'm going to have to disagree with you. There is no reasonable time of day to be playing drums in an apartment building. The professional musician in the other comment was correct, drums belong in a standalone home or a studio space, not in a building where other people's homes share walls with you, period. No matter what time of day, people have the right to reasonably peaceful enjoyment of their own homes.", "I can't afford a studio", "Thanks for the suggestion I actually use foam covered hard rubber cubes with plywood and anti fatigue mat. The drums also sit in an additional plywood rubber and anti fatigue mat setup.", "You have a right to complain about their TV because it's audible in your apartment, just like they have a right to complain about your drums being audible in their apartment.", "You can't always base this on being heard or not. \n\nIt's really more about the level of noise and if there are any quiet hours or restrictions on drum sets in the lease. If there are local decibel maximums or quiet hours. \n\nOp, you can download a decibel measuring app and check to see what the local and complex rules are. \n\nMany places limit noise from 10pm to 7am and decibel levels to 70 ish. Some apartments don't allow drum sets. \n\nMaybe try a drum mute or portable isolation booth?", "But only one wall is shared with that apartment. If there\u2019s no window, can\u2019t you put it against one of the other two door-less walls?", "Surely the landlord would know that though??  There are so many little contradictions with you. It's a 2 bdrm, low-income apartment for families but you live there 'by yourself at the moment' but then that changes to you live there with your mom. You said in the baby's room the sound should be 'muffled' which you then compared to 'a loud YouTube video', which are two completely different things. Then 'they want the natural light'  but the room doesn't have a window?? And the landlord somehow doesn't know that? And you didn't tell him?", "I understand what you\u2019re trying to get across, it\u2019s just BS. If it\u2019s loud enough to wake a baby, it\u2019s too loud.

You, the AH with the drums, receiver of noise complaints, doesn't make anymore noise than any other family?", "[deleted]", "You should definitely do this. Bide your time until you hear the baby crying and call your landlord about the noise", "For clarification the noise level of a TV on the other side of a wall would put you in the fetal position?", "Totally. I figured you would be on top of it, you\u2019ve obviously put a ton of thought and work into getting it right. And once more for the record, you did.

During the middle of the day it's expected to be able to Make some noise.\n\nLifelong apartment dweller here, usually quite times are specified in the lease", "That's what op states he has done there is full soundproofing and the drums are in a booth", "The way the booth is made it's like in a corner with 3 sides. Originally made that way due to the room being a shared space. I don't think I'm explaining that right but half the booth is attached on the unshared wall and the other half attached on the shared wall. It was the best solution we had at that time. Unfortunately with how it was constructed a lot of the soundproofing will need to be taken down to unattach it from the secondary walls. \n\nThe amount of wall the booth shares with the shared wall is maybe 3 or 4ft", "1. The landlord absolutely knows about the light. He was there when it was discussed. My issue is not what they think natural light is and my landlord just side eyed them and moved on. \n\n2. The apartment is a two bedroom but I will admit I made this confusing with how I worded it and not explaining. The apartment was just my mom and dad. The bedroom was a master and smaller that he used as an office/sitting room. I made the master into two \"rooms\" by putting up a wall. That's where my bedroom came from. The smaller room is where all of the drumming is taking place. Sorry for the confusion.\n\n3. Yes I'm here with my mom. My dad is gone. She's at prolonged doctor appointments that I'm not getting into right now. She will be back soon enough\n\n4. A loud YouTube video from someone across the room is the same level of talking in the room beside you. I also have the example of if there was a TV on the other side of the wall. You can hear them all but not really make out what is being said. It's muffled. I would have the same issue if I took out all the padding and put a TV in that spot\n\n5. Even if you didn't ask I will say the landlord knows a out the drums. He even checked the noise level with me", "Any noise is loud enough to wake a baby if people expect complete silence for their babies. Those babies, in turn, will become children who can't sleep without absolute silence and the cycle will continue forever.", "Op was there first and has literally build a sound reducing booth into that room.

They chose to have a kid, it's unfair to live in an apartment complex and make other people listen to it crying.", "That is just objectively not true, like, at all.", "Who was there first is irrelevant.
