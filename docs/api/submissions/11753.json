It's for low income families but at the moment it's just me. I'm a music student with both bass and drums. I use my furthest bedroom as my music room where I practice. The way the floorplan is set up the apartment to my left mirrors mine but the one to my right is opposite and only one floor. I've lived here for the last 6 years and have gotten along with my neighbors. \n\nLast month a new couple moved in the left one apartment with a newborn. Maybe a week old at that point so now a month. I'm unsure how they had it setup for the first two weeks but two week ago I was practicing on the drums and was interrupted by pounding on the door because I woke the baby up. I apologized and double checked my sound proofing (padding but also have a drum booth) but found no gaps. The sound is muffled but loud enough to be heard in the mirrored room but nowhere else in the other apartment. I know that based on that guy that lived there before. A few days later it happened again while practicing and I noticed I could hear the baby crying almost perfectly. I got in a screaming match with the husband and we got the apartment manager to come out and settle it. Turns out they put the kid's crib right on the other side of the wall where my drums setup is. The couple said that was the only room with the amount of natural light they wanted for the kid. They told me to move the room I used for music and I agreed as long as they footed the bill for the sound proofing and they called me an asshole. Now they have been calling in none stop noise complaints.\n\nEdited to say the couple actually agreed the only room they could hear the drums in was that one room. However they like the lighting in there so they won't move the baby. The neighbors on the other side were surprised to find out I had drums. The only two rooms you can hear the drums are the ones that share a wall and it sounds muffled as if someone in the room with you was watching a loud YouTube video", "created_utc": 1678234573, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11lgfl3/aita_for_not_moving_my_music_room/", "score": 2992, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It would be different if everyone who lived there has always complained.   Apartment or not, no one has ever complained before.  Ever.

You've made some with soundproofing, and if they aren't willing to compromise location, there's other areas that are easy enough to arrange.

What is so freaking special about \"the light\" that they can't move the stupid crib a couple of feet one way or the other and go back to how things were before they jammed the kid up against the only conduction point in the building?

They want the crib in that one specific spot that is literally right behind the drum booth. The one spot that has the greatest chance of sound escaping or vibration.", "Fair enough I will concede that. However I've only really ever seen that happen when you putting it directly by that baby which you shouldn't do even awake. Even with my soundproofing it still sounds like it's across the room and you can't make out what is being played. They would get the exact same sound level if I took everything, padding included, out and put a TV in it's place", "I do believe I lost a lot of people when I said drums in an apartment. My sound proofing consists of a layer of sound dampening padding on the existing wall, 2x4+plywood build outs to create a second wall and floor with sound proofing insulation added, rubber cushioning, and another layer of sound dampening pads. Then my drums have a 2x4 frame and sound dampening glass booth. Luckily there are no windows in this room\n\nAlso my drums have felt padding on them also to dampen the sound.\n\nMy hours I practice are between the hours of noon and 4 pm. \n\nThe biggest issue is the crib is directly on the other side of the wall the booth is on.

If I play in the room you can barely hear it at my front door. I built double walls with padding just for it. The booth is the same both used in theaters to muffle the harsh drum sounds. If I start playing music from my computer in a non soundproof room it would be louder. \n\nEdited to add I did tell them the room is padded. They agreed they couldn't hear it in any other room besides that one but they couldn't move the baby because they liked the lighting.", "The padded room is in consideration for the neighbors.

The neighbors on the other side were surprised to find out I even had drums.\n\nWhen I say they put the baby directly on the other side of the booth I mean directly.

And a TV wouldn't be in that position? Have you ever lived in an apartment. You can hear your neighbors tv if it's against one wall which is where most people put their TV's. Matter of fact their bedroom TV is on the same wall as my bed. \n\nBut wait go back. How is a YouTube video on a phone and unacceptable noise level?? I literally had to turn one on and walk to the other side of my room just to make sure we are hearing the same thing.", "I'm trying super hard to have empathy. The only reason my music room is even to that level of soundproofing is because my parents are old and pretty much can't take a high noise level so I kept soundproofing until they couldn't hear it at wll in their room which is the first room by the front door while my music room is the third room.", "Simple enough answer but a tad bit depressing. It's my parents and I help take care of my mom since my dad passed.", "Why would anyone complain when they can't hear it. The only room in the other apartment you can hear it in is that room.

There is a second wall plus padding and a drum booth to mute the sound further.

Even that couple agreed you couldn't hear it in any other room.", "Fair enough however I did play almost daily even the first two weeks. It's really weird how they never heard it until two weeks later when they placed the crib in that exact spot directly behind the drum booth. So of the month of this happening the baby didn't wake up until session 14ish? The room is sound proofed and the neighbors agreed you couldn't even hear it in any other room besides that one. Even if you did hear it it could be confused with a TV on the other side of the wall. It sounded like someone was watching YouTube in the same room as you but you cant really make out what they are saying", "I came here to get judgement and I'm even answering the ones that say ESH OR NTA. Everybody has brought up really great points and it's sparked an interpersonal discussion. And it has given me my next course of action \n\nAlso I have come to the understanding I am in fact the AH for having instruments in my apartment. I will accept that. Offering counterpoints actually helps me.\n\nEdited to say for the most part im just just trying to offer clarification of the situation with that noise level and setup", "I do. Whole room is padded and sound proof and I play in a sound proof drum booth, and my drums are felted", "Very true", "I\u2019d be willing to bet if they moved the crib to the opposite wall and added a simple white noise machine they\u2019d be fine.", "NTA they\u2019re being entitled and unreasonable.", "Yeah NTA. I feel bad for their baby.", ">it sounds muffled as if someone in the room with you was watching a loud YouTube video.\n\n\n>The same volume as if someone in the same room as you was watching YouTube. Like you can hear it but can't really make it out.\n\n\nThese responses make me wonder if your hearing is already somewhat impaired from your music practice because there is nothing 'muffled' about a 'loud youtube video playing in the same room.' A loud youtube video is loud,  not 'muffled. Are you saying the parents shouldn't be complaining about the equivalent of *a loud YouTube video* playing in their baby's nursery while it's sleeping / trying to sleep?? If someone in the same room as me is playing a youtube video, I can absolutely hear it. I really think you should consider getting your hearing checked. \n\n\nAside from that though, expecting to play drums in an apartment without complaint is a pretty big ask. I know and have known tons of drummers in my lifetime and every. single. one. of them played in their soundproofed basement or their soundproofed garage and were sensitive about the time of day they played.
