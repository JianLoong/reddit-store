But then I decided to enjoy those trips for what they were and especially enjoy our time together. We did a long automobile trip across the country and a couple of cruises, plus some shorter trips. The last trip was supposed to be at the beginning of 2020 where I'd planned to meet her in Hong Kong for the last portion of a long cruise that she was already on. Because of the pandemic, that meetup never happened and her cruise was cut short. She died at the end of 2021.\n\nI treasure the memory of those trips we took together.\n\nSo -- if you have a good relationship with your mother, even if it's not feasible for your mother to go with you on this particular trip, my suggestion is to consider leaving things open to spend quality time with your mother while you still can. \n\nNAH", "NTA and stop discussing your plans with your family.
