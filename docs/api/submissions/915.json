{"id": 915, "submission_id": "ykhau0", "title": "AITA for waking up my roommate by talking on the phone at night?", "selftext": "My friend and I rented a room together for our first semester of college. I moved from a different city and we're going to a school in his home city. There was a friend I left behind when I moved out of college who has mental issues and was dependent on me for support. She was distraught that I was moving, but I made a promise to her that I would always be available to talk to any time of the day or night. Because of this I never put my phone on silent.\n\nShe calls a lot late at night because of her schedule, that's when she's able to talk. I don't mind so much because I'm a night person and have insomnia. My friend/roommate however has started complaining that it wakes him up and asks if I could put my phone on silent at night. I said no. I go out of my way to talk quietly on the phone, but he says the ringing wakes him up and me talking keeps him awake, sometimes for a long time. I suggested ear plugs or headphones and he seemed pissed.\n\nTo make matters worse my friend seems like he's starting to resent me and her for it. She was talking about moving here and I asked my friend if he could ask our apartment complex if we have any open rooms. He said no and said that from what he's heard he doesn't like her and thinks she's manipulative. This pissed me off. He shouldn't be saying that, and how hard would it be for him to do a simple thing like that and help me out. Isn't he supposed to be my friend? I would do it for him.\n\nI'm a person of my word and don't want to break this promise to her. Frankly I've known her longer and her well being is a priority to me. I don't get why it would be so hard for him to get earplugs or something. I'm paying for the bedroom too and I have a right to use it as my space. I think her well being is more important than the inconvenience of my roommate having to wear earplugs or something.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Just for clarity it doesn't happen every night. I've known this girl since COVID lockdown (met during lockdown) and only known my roommate for a few months.", "created_utc": 1667422915, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykhau0/aita_for_waking_up_my_roommate_by_talking_on_the/", "score": 1562, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're pretending that there's no solution except keeping your roommate awake is both assholish and frankly narcissistic.\n\nand why is it HIS problem to look for an apartment for her?  \n\n> to make matters worse my friend seems like he's starting to resent me and her for it\n\nwell, at least you're not totally oblivious.", "Oof.\n\nYTA in this situation, friend. Your intentions are genuine, but.. he\u2019s also paying for this space.\n\nListen, he has a right to sleep. In apartment complex, in the city, and on campus there are hours of silence. Hell, even bars close down after a while.\n\nPeople need sleep and you\u2019re interrupting his and instead of taking responsibility, you\u2019re forcing him to take action for YOUR issues. Why not put it on vibrate?\n\nAnd about the girl.. listen, she needs therapy. You should NOT be responsible for her feelings. Whether she realizes it or not, she IS manipulating you. There NEEDS to be boundaries there.\n\nBeing codependent isn\u2019t helping anyone.", "YTA.  Yes, sharing a room means you are never going to have everything exactly as you'd like, and you have to put up with noises inherent  in communal living situations.  But frequent late night phone calls are something else.  Put your phone on vibrate or wear Bluetooth headphones to bed yourself, then take the phonecall outside.  \n\nAs for asking about openings in the building, why is that your roommates job?  Why can't you do that yourself?", "YTA. They're being forced to share a room with you and you're staying up late at night, letting your phone ring, which is definitely annoying, and then chit chatting and demanding HE be the one to find a fix for it? Sure. His fix is going to be moving out on you. And why should he help you? You're not doing him any favors. Go out into the hall or the living room or somewhere that's not where he's trying to sleep. He's in his room, at night, late, in bed, trying to sleep. You're having a gossip session. You're a complete ahole.", "YTA - you\u2019re severely over complicating this issue. This has nothing to do with your other friend and your relationship. You\u2019re an AH for waking up your roommate by talking on the phone. Unless it\u2019s a literal life or death emergency you just don\u2019t do that.", "YTA. Put your phone on vibrate and take it out of the room if you're going to be talking to someone late at night. When you share a room, you have to have a modicum of common courtesy, and it sounds like you don't even know the definition", "YTA full stop. You are not entitled to disturb someone else\u2019s sleep. If you\u2019re so concerned about keeping your promise why don\u2019t you designate a time to call her every night at the same time. Go down the street stand if I\u2019m at 7-Eleven and talk all you want.", "YTA. You agreed to a time-consuming and inconvenient way to support your friend. That\u2019s totally fine. But, your roommate did not. He needs to be able to use his own room for essential tasks, and sleep is pretty much at the top of that list. You need to inconvenience yourself more to make this work (phone on vibrate, earbuds to hear ringing, being \nelsewhere when the call comes in, not talking in the room when he\u2019s asleep), and not push the complications on him.", "\u201cI would do it for him\u201d You can\u2019t even put your phone on vibrate for him, why should he accommodate you back? YTA", "if you\u2019re an insomniac, you can notice your phone on vibrate. Then it is absolute barbaric of you to leave a ringer on late at night AND talk with someone while someone else is trying to sleep in the same room. Ever heard of a thing called quiet hours? Abide by them. YTA\n\nEdit: misspelled word", "YTA\n\nYour roommate is not unreasonable in expecting you to be quiet at night. He is paying rent for somewhere to sleep. Your night calls are disturbing him. Your friend is not his responsibility. You should not be waking him up at all.", "YTA. When you share a room with someone, you need to be considerate of the other person. Taking calls in the middle of the night is not being considerate. It's rude and makes him loose sleep.   \nI saw in a comment that you know what it's like to be tired, but you only know what it's like FOR YOU. You cannot say you know how he feels, because you don't. You can't. \n\nNow he is your friend and he is asking you to consider him. Don't be a bad friend, a bad roommate or a bad tennant. \n\nFind a way to keep your promise without hurting your living situation. \n\nAlso, if your friend needs this much support, I do hope she gets the right help. As good as your intentions are, you are not a professional and you cannot 'fix' things. you can support, but you need boundaries. Being co-dependant isn't healthy for either of you, but it can seriously hinder her mental health.", "YTA if sharing a room and chatting on the phone in the moddle of the night. Go somewhere else to talk.", "YTA and just plain rude.", "YTA. You agreed to share a room and you are keeping your roommate awake. I would be pissed too. Put your phone on silent and let it vibrate and take your conversation outside. This is common sense if you share a room, you have to make concessions. If you want to talk late at night, get your own room (and still don\u2019t be loud). Why on earth do you think you are entitled to do whatever you want at someone else\u2019s expense? \n\nTotal AH behavior", "YTA\n\nYou're being remarkably inconsiderate. You expect your roommate to put up with YOUR friend's issues, to accommodate you in keeping your promise, wtf? Go talk somewhere else. Expecting to have silence after a certain time is not unreasonable.", "YTA. Put your phone on vibrate and leave the room to talk. Of course he resents you -- you're interfering with his sleep and your behavior is very rude and self-centered. So is the friend that is calling -- I would be horrified if the other half of my conversation was keeping a stranger awake night after night. Fix this.", "YTA\r  \n\r  \nCome on now, really? You know it's an asshole move to not put your phone on silent in a shared room, when it rings in the middle of the night. Then as added relish you just take the call and talk, waking and keeping your room mate up with zero empathy for them. I'm not sure why being a \"person of my word\" means you can just be a dick to others you live with. You have a very entitled attitude. \r  \n\r  \nThis friend of your has issues beyond what you can help them with, they need a therapist, not a shoulder to lean on. It's selfish of her to think you can be at her beck and call regardless of the hour, knowing full well you share a room with someone.", "YTA. Sleep on the couch in a common area if you need to have your phone on sound. Good lord that fact that you even need to have this conversation on Reddit shows how clueless you are. \n\nYou sound like an insufferable roommate.", "YTA \n\nAs roommate you not only have rights, but also the *duty* to be considerate in shared spaces. Taking phone calls at night when someone is trying to sleep is NOT being considerate.\n\nAnd if your 'friend' calls you in the middle of the night and you don't notice it because of the silent alarm and your deep sleep, well, then she needs to call at a later time. Your promise to her is unsustainable and needs boundaries!\n\nYou aren't a therapist. If her problems are that severe she needs one. \n\nThe easy solution is to take the call outside and schedule the phone calls with your 'friend' so you can expect them in advance. Don't make your problems that of the roommate ... you are the nuisance at nighttime here. Well, actually your 'friend' is, you are just the useful tool that she has at her beck and call.", "Guess what, sleep is useful in contributing to good mental and physical health.\n\nYour roommate did NOT make any commitment to giving up his sleep. You can't negatively impact his wellbeing just because you're too lazy to take your call elsewhere. There are SO MANY simple and logical things you could do to not be disruptive - put your phone on vibrate on keep it on your person, set it to silent but have it blink when it rings, go to the bathroom or away from your sleeping roommate to answer. HE doesn't have to make adjustments for YOU here. Also, maybe your friend can also benefit from some professional MH support to.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re being very inconsiderate to your roommate. You need to go outside of your room to have a private conversation. Put the phone on vibrate and then leave the room. I\u2019d be super annoyed if I were woken up in the middle of the night constantly by a loud ringer and then have to listen to my roommate\u2019s conversation while I\u2019m trying to sleep.\n\nAlso it\u2019s not your roomie\u2019s responsibility to ask your apartment complex if there\u2019s any availability, why can\u2019t you ask yourself? Or pass along the contact info for the landlord or property management to your friend for her to ask.", "strong YTA. go outside or something if you need to talk on the phone. but also, you need to seriously think about your codependent relationship with your friend. that\u2019s fucked up.", "YTA\n\nYou're sharing a room, you need to respect quiet hours.\n\nI'm not suggesting you ditch your friend, but you need to find work-arounds to not wake your roommate up. This likely means putting your phone on vibrate and keeping it near you to wake you, or wearing bluetooth connected sleep headphones so only you hear the ring. And then taking the conversation OUT of the bedroom as quietly as possible.", "YTA. \n\nLook, clearly you are not interested in a judgement, judging by your responses. I think you came here hoping to be validated and instead, no one agrees with you. Instead of arguing with everyone, you could just start to ask yourself WHY no one agrees with you. \n\nIt reads as though you think we don't understand your point of view. We do. \n\n>She was distraught that I was moving, but I made a promise to her that I would always be available to talk to any time of the day or night. Because of this I never put my phone on silent.\n\nYou made a promise. We get it. But it's entirely your responsibility to make sure you can keep it. And that means YOU and not everyone else around you. So if you are so hellbent on keeping this one: move the fuck out. It's not that difficult. But do everyone a favor and move into a single apartment, do NOT - under any circumstances - go for one with other roommates. They will be just as desperate to get rid of you as your friend currently is. To anyone else, this would have already occured as the best solution but that requires stepping back from YOUR personal needs for one second and trying to take on someone else's perspective. I would urge you to try it, it will help you in other things in life as well.", "YTA, there's clearly solutions available that don't hurt your friend or keep your roomie up at night and you're just not doing them cos they're harder. You could put your phone in vibrate and keep it in a pocket so you can feel it when it goes off, or you could plug headphones into your phone so it doesn't disturb your roomie when your phone rings.\n\nNight time is when people have a fair expectation of quiet to sleep conditions in their home. YTA for not respecting it", "Yta bro. Why don't you go to sleep with earphones on so only you can hear the ringing, or schedule with your friend to have the call at a set time and day. That way, you can keep the phone on silent and still answer cause you know when it's coming.", "You didn't even put the phone on SILENT at home?!\n\nYTA", "YTA. If you need to take the call from your friend take it out of the room. The space is his space too and he has a right to be able to sleep without getting interrupted by your phone", "YTA, you are makiny noise at odd hours, that's all. He shouldny use earplugs coz you cant be bothered to switch your phone to silent lol. Get yourself a cheap smartwatch that vibrates when you have incoming calls or smth. And then go outside to talk. That's what you do if you have to take phonecalls at night, not ask your roommate to get earplugs", "Uh, yes YTA. Why are you acting so entitled? Just because you have insomnia doesn't mean that you shouldn't care about your roommates sleep schedule. Why does he need to adapt to your selfish needs by purchasing earplugs when you can easily go outside to call your friend and put your phone on silence. \n\nI do agree with that he shouldn't resent your friend, because she is not the problem. It is you that is inconsiderate. And you shouldn't expect him to help you out for your and her benefit if you don't simply help him out by calling outside where he can't hear it. Friendship goes two ways.\n\nJust because you're paying for the bathroom too doesn't make you entitled to do as you please without taking other well-beings into account. The wellbeing of your friend is not his problem and shouldn't be.", "YTA. Quiet during nighttime hours is a completely reasonable request. Don\u2019t care how long you\u2019ve known your friend, you have to respect the person you are sharing a living space with. Apologise and be a better roommate in the future.", "YTA. If you insist on talking on the phone while roommate is sleeping, you need to leave the room. Very rude to keep him up or insist he use ear plugs. He shouldn\u2019t have to do that. Also, you need to set up appointed times to talk with your phone friend so that you do not have to leave your ringer on at night.", ">and I asked my friend if he could ask our apartment complex if we have any open room\n\nWhy can't you ask yourself?\n\n>This pissed me off.

YTA if you are consistently causing anyone to lose sleep. Go take your calls somewhere else. Honestly you\u2019re a huge asshole for this and I hope you learn from this experience.", "You say that you'd help your roommate with their mental health if the situations were switched, and yet in reality deny them sleep?  Basic college dorm courtesy is to go elsewhere to take a phone call, especially if the other is SLEEPING. \n\nOP, you may want to see a therapist yourself to figure out healthy boundaries. You're letting one friend call you at late hours, to put her mental health on you instead of a therapist. Your friend's mental health cannot just be on you, and if she's said that it is, that is unhealthy at best and manipulative at worst. She needs a real therapist. Meanwhile, you are trampling your roommate's boundaries in a space that is THEIRS, TOO. They did not sign up to sleep in the same room as you, yet get no sleep.\n\nYTA", "Yes..YTA. You're roommate should not pay the price for you talking to your friend. It also sounds like she needs more help than can be given on the phone. Your solution for your roommate to wear earphones only requires work on his part where it is your phone call that is disturbing things. Your phone call...you find the solution that works for your roommate.", "YTA and a selfish one lol is not only the ringing of the phone (which Is annoying af by itself) but you even speak with her in the room while he's speaking...are you for real? At least get out of the room, literally 0 empathy.", "YTA\n\nThere are many many many ways to communicate non-verbally these days.

Then I read the post and yep, still YTA.", "YTA\n\nYour roommate has a right to sleep without being disturbed. Being a night owl who has had problems with insomnia, I know how precious sleep is. Believe me, you'd complain if someone kept waking you up. \n\nOthers have pointed out ways you could take your friend's calls without disturbing your roommate. Use them. \n\nAlso, your friend needs therapy. It is nice that you give her some support, but she seems to want a lot from you and you are not a trained counselor. Please encourage her to find a counselor near her.", "YTA.\n\n>how hard would it be for him to do a simple thing like that and help me out.\n\nYou're asking him for a favour when you can't respect him enough to not take calls late in the night when you share a room... and you're shocked he isn't interested in doing so?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm paying for the bedroom too and I have a right to use it as my space.\n\nIt is both of your spaces, and he has a right to sleep in it.

When you share a room. You are ridiculously rude! How would you feel getting woken out of a dead sleep and then kept up? What is wrong with you? Definitely the asshole!", "Your friend needs therapy and you need to find a way to stop being her emergency contact if it happens this often to the point of disturbing your roommate. It's also more than likely, which I doubt you would be willing to admit, cutting into your own mental health and sleep. Your friend who calls isn't an AH but you need to set some boundaries. \n\nAnd yes, YTA for waking up your roommate. It isn't your roommate's responsibility to cater to your selfishness.", "YTA and you know it. Let your poor roommate sleep", "Yta, you are being so inconsiderate of your roommate, take the call outside if you must be on the phone at unreasonable hours.you are a very entitled person.", "You are being super inconsiderate.", "YTA. You are being terrible to your roommate. Being deprived of proper sleep utterly ruins the bedrock of your day. It puts everything on a bad footing. And frequently, by the sounds of it, you're interrupting your roommate's sleep. You need to change your living arrangements because your situations aren't mutually compatible.", "YTA. If I was that roommate I\u2019d be getting you thrown out ASAP. \nHe is well within his rights to expect silence every night between say 10-7. The only things that should interrupt that silence is if you have to get up to go to the toilet, get a drink or get up for the day.. and then they should be done as quietly as possible. \n\nI can\u2019t believe people have to point this out.. that\u2019s a new level of stupid.", "YTA. Put your phone on vibrate and leave the room to talk.\n\nEdited to add have your friend text when she needs to talk so you can leave the room and call her.", "YTA\n\nYou are inconsiderate to your roommate but expect thing from roommate?\n\nThat's not how it works, you don't get to be inconsiderate and then feel entitled to their help.", "YTA you want him to do you a huge favor when you give him nothing but a bad night sleep in return. I hope he starts blasting music when you sleep you deserve it.", "IMO, YTA. Sometimes people need very specific conditions to be able to fall asleep and remain asleep, silence being one of them and earplugs are just uncomfortable. You ask how hard it is to wear earplugs. How hard would it be to just put your phone on silent? If you're a night person, wouldn't you already be awake and be able to see that your phone is ringing? Also, if you have insomnia, wouldn't you be able to empathize with your roommate not being able to get enough sleep? I'd for sure resent someone who's causing me to get disturbed sleep lol.", "YTA. \n\nSleep is a physical NEED. The room is the only place he can really sleep. He is entitled to sleep there. His NEED to sleep supersedes your desire to ...be alerted only by a ringing phone to your friend's call at her convenience? Like there are so many solutions. Have her text you when she's going to call so you can step out and call her. Put the phone on vibrate in your pocket so you can step out when it rings. Set a time to call so you can leave the room beforehand. Text instead of calling. His ability to GET SLEEP is more important than the inconvenience of you putting your phone on silent or vibrate and picking one of myriad other ways to know when your friend is calling so you can go outside the room and talk to her. He does not need to wear ear plugs--which not everyone can sleep with-- and risk not hearing his alarm because you WANT to have your phone ring out loud and you WANT to talk to your friend on the phone in the BEDroom in the middle of the night. You can talk on the phone in a common space or outside. \n\nAnd then you wonder why your roommate doesn't want her moving in so you and she can have a top volume live and in person nightly 2 am chat in his bedroom. JFC. Yeah, of course he's starting to resent you and her. He NEEDS sleep and you are being APPALLINGLY selfish and inconsiderate.", "YTA - put your phone on vibrate and strap it to your arm so the vibration actually wakes you up! That\u2019s more reasonable than expecting your roommate to wear earplugs. Also leave the room if it\u2019s late and go talk in the bathroom if you are concerned with other people in the house. Literally any other room with the door closed or even a balcony. You are the one being inconsiderate here. You are prioritizing your other friends and your own comfort over your roommate. You are being unreasonably noisy in a shared living space. Make a plan and stop being an asshole.", "YTA. Let people sleep. Also: talk to the building yourself. Maybe you and your friend can get a place together, and your current roommate can find an actual considerate person to replace you.", "YTA. Put it on vibrate. If you have a smart watch, you can use that to wake you up quietly. And take your call outside ffs. It's incredibly rude to constantly wake up your roommate and keep him awake. If you don't stop, he might get mad enough to ask your landlord for a new room for *himself*.", "YTA\n\nYou are being inconsiderate", "Info: why can\u2019t you or your friends on the phone go to the apartment complex and ask if they have rooms? Why are your expecting your sleep deprived roommate to do it for you?", "Your friend should not be dependent on you for support and should get the help she needs from a professional.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual to expect quiet at night when everyone else is sleeping.\n\nYTA", "YTA. You are not this girl\u2019s personal therapist and it\u2019s unreasonable to expect your roommate to tolerate wake-ups in the night.", "YTA - \n\nThere's lots of ways here you can keep your promise to your friend. \n\nAt night why not have your Bluetooth headphones in so the ringer goes to the headphones rather than rings out loud? If you have a smart watch why not have the ringer buzz on the watch and be silent on the phone? You literally could have the phone on vibrate and hold it at night so you can still feel it when it buzzes. \n\nAlso, there's literally zero reason to be taking the call in the same room. The primary use of a living space is a safe place to *sleep* virtually everything else you do besides bathing can be done easily elsewhere. I was in an LDR in college and it was literally no effort to sit out in the hallway on the phone and talk as long as needed. \n\nIt just sounds like there is a level of entitlement here that's closing you off to reasonable solutions that doesn't make your problem your roommates' problem. Your roommate isn't asking you to break your promise. \n\nAlso would your friend be okay knowing that their calls are actively disturbing your roommate every day? I'm sure if you brought it up to them they'd likely want to find a way to be supported by you that doesn't also contribute to harming someone else.", "YTA but I think the idea that \u2018compromise\u2019 on your part would be considered breaking a promise is what is holding up your ability to accept this. \n\nListen, I am treated for insomnia and I too can sleep deeply when I do actually sleep. I also have kids and am awoken by them often when they were young. I don\u2019t think you do understand how hard it is to go back to sleep when you are woken up especially suddenly which floods your body with adrenaline. Additionally I can\u2019t sleep with ear plugs. They hurt my ears. \n\nYou made a promise to your friend to always be there for her, which is honorable I guess, but your friend can also be asked to call at a reasonable hour. Or to send a text if she thinks she needs to call you later that night in which case you stay up. Also, you can sleep with ear buds in and hear the phone ring while you sleep and roommate never hears a thing EXCEPT then you need to leave the room to talk to her. And if this girl\u2019s mental health is such that you missing a late night call because you were asleep you are wel past your usage as a friend and actually damaging her mental health more. She needs a therapist not a friend. \n\nYour roommate is not wrong to ask you to not talk on the phone at night when he is asleep. There are hallways that can be used instead. You are paying the same that he is paying and he has every right to be able to sleep IN A BEDROOM. He isn\u2019t paying to sleep in a call center. Tell your girlfriend you can\u2019t talk after a certain time or get yourself some earphones that can connect to your phone to wake you when she calls. Also consider that your insomnia will never get better when you voluntarily mess with your sleep hygiene by answering calls at night.", "im a night owl aswell and i have to say yta stay in a common area until your ready to go to sleep", "YTA\nYour roommate should not have to do anything to accommodate your promise and now problems. *You* should get some earbuds that connect to your phone. That way you can keep your phone on and when she calls it will ring in your ear and not wake him up.

I moved from a different state and we're going to a school in his home state. There was a friend I left behind when I moved out of college who has mental issues and was dependent on me for support. She was distraught that I was moving, but I made a promise to her that I would always be available to talk to any time of the day or night. Because of this I never put my phone on silent.\n\nShe calls a lot late at night because of her schedule, that's when she's able to talk. I don't mind so much because I'm a night person and have insomnia. My friend/roommate however has started complaining that it wakes him up and asks if I could put my phone on silent at night. I said no. I go out of my way to talk quietly on the phone, but he says the ringing wakes him up and me talking keeps him awake, sometimes for a long time. I suggested ear plugs or headphones and he seemed pissed.\n\nTo make matters worse my friend seems like he's starting to resent me and her for it. She was talking about moving here and I asked my friend if he could ask our apartment complex if we have any open rooms. He said no and said that from what he's heard he doesn't like her and thinks she's manipulative. This pissed me off. He shouldn't be saying that, and how hard would it be for him to do a simple thing like that and help me out. Isn't he supposed to be my friend? I would do it for him.\n\nI'm a person of my word and don't want to break this promise to her. Frankly I've known her longer and her well being is a priority to me. I don't get why it would be so hard for him to get earplugs or something. I'm paying for the bedroom too and I have a right to use it as my space. I think her well being is more important than the inconvenience of my roommate having to wear earplugs or something.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But more than that you're TA to yourself (& somewhat to your friend). And I say this as someone who's been in your shoes exactly, when it comes to supporting a friend with poor mental health. \n\nIt's not safe for you or for your friend for you to be the only person supporting her. What if your phone broke and she tried calling you while in crisis? She needs to have other coping skills and other people in her support network, and it would be best for her in the long term to work through what she's dealing with so she does not regularly need this kind of support. \n\nThe reason it's dangerous for you is because when a friend is dependent on you like that, it becomes difficult to set any sort of boundaries or say no for any reason. It becomes difficult to express discomfort over something that's happened in the friendship. Your friend does deserve support and help, but not at your expense. \n\nFeeling like you must keep your phone on at all hours of the night to support your friend is starting to impact the security of your housing situation by impacting your relationship with your roommate. In a healthy friendship, you would be able to let her know that you need to stop having your phone ringer on at night, or you'll risk complicating or even losing your housing situation. \n\nIf you have cause to be afraid of how your friend might react to you telling her that you can't remain as availible to her all the time\u2014afraid either that she'd lash out at you or that she'd self destruct in some way\u2014then the friendship isn't healthy the way it is right now. \n\nI've had codependent/emeshed friendships before where realizing that it was unhealthy and starting to set boundaries and work on my own healing lead to booth me and my friend getting better, and i've had friendships like this that were ended by the (now ex) friend who was opposed to me setting healthier boundaries with them\u2014because they had been benefitting from my lack of boundaries and were angry to lose that.\n\nIf for no other reason, consider setting boundaries with your friend for her sake. After a certain point, completely limitless support like the support you give her turns into enabling. It sucks learning this the hard way, because it feels like kidness to offer someone unconditional support. But it is also kind to have healthy boundaries with someone, and to give them both the chance to learn how to navigate relationships more healthily and to navigate some of their challenges on their own.\n\nI hope you see this comment, and I hope that you're able to gradually start setting boundaries with your friend and that she responds well to them.

Then when she does call, if you're worried about waking people, leave the building. I'm glad you value your word but this isn't the medieval times and you didn't take an oath bound by law or blood. 2020 was a different time. It's almost 2023. Times have changed. We aren't all sitting at home in a state of uncertainty with all the free time.", "NAH, but I want to qualify this by saying up that you *are* in the wrong here.\n\nYour roommate has the right to not have his sleep constantly interrupted. I realize that you made a promise to your friend, but your roommate did not and he doesn't deserve to be dragged through the hell you're putting him through. Sleep deprivation is literally a form of torture. You are torturing him.\n\nYou made a promise to your friend, but you also made an implicit promise to your roommate when you entered into the lease that you would be a decent roommate, and you are currently breaking that promise to him in spectacular fashion.\n\nSo, you need to find another solution to this unfortunate situation you've gotten yourself in. You have to find a way to keep both your promises or you *will* be the asshole (and a promise-breaking asshole at that).\n\nThe way I see it, there are only a few options:\n\n1. Get your own room, with sufficiently thick walls so that you don't disturb your neighbors. If you don't make another change, this will be the default option because your roommates will kick you to the curb.\n\n2. Get a smart watch that buzzes you awake on your wrist, or some other technological solution. You seem adamant that these won't work, but have you tried them?\n\n3. Modify your promise to your friend. Instead of taking all calls when she calls you, instead you'll put your phone on silent from specified hours, then call her back when you can. Promises are open to renegotiation if they become untenable, and this one very much is not tenable.\n\n4. Help your friend to get some professional help. I've been where you are with several people, and ultimately, **you are not helping her**. You're turning yourself inside out and really only acting as a crutch. Your friend sounds like she has some kind of anxiety disorder, and she's not going to get better by having her anxieties indulged on demand.  She needs help from a therapist to develop coping techniques that will allow her to manage her issues without requiring a person on retainer 24/7/365.\n\nIt's admirable that you want to help your friend. It's admirable that you want to keep your promise. But promises are simple and life is complicated, and honoring the spirit of a promise can mean rephrasing it, especially when promises conflict. You're not an asshole, but refusing to make any changes *would* make you an asshole.", "YTA your roommate doesn\u2019t have to wear earplugs for your calls.

Sometimes we have to recognize that what we don't understand is our problem, not societies.\nEdit: I can't personally wear ear plugs because that's  a sensory issue for me. Instead of making that my sister's fault for having a young child I made that MY issue (BC I couldn't afford housing otherwise) and worked around it like an adult.", "YTA, you made a promise to talk, not your roommate. Why should he suffer with you? If it were me I'd have cancelled the deal or have a huge fight with you. Plus I'd say suggest therapy to the girl, you can just listen to her problems, she needs help and you're stopping her from becoming healthy. She might not be in the right mind to go but as a friend help her find a therapist not making her come to you. Apologize to your roommate.", "It sounds like you might be on the spectrum a little bit man. How seriously you take this promise and inability to emphasize with your roommate is a little concerning.", "YTA- put your phone on vibrate and take the call somewhere else. It\u2019s not that hard.", "YTA and you CANNOT be you friends personal therapist. I've been there done that and it's not healthy. They need an actual therapist on their side not you.", "YTA. Go speak quietly in the apartment complex's laundry room or some other unoccupied public space if you want to talk in the middle of the night.", "You are definitely the ahole", "YTA. What you should be doing is keeping the phone on vibrate. Also leaving the room and going outside to talk would be a better option. I\u2019ve lived with roommates for 10 years and I\u2019ve always been considerate. I always go outside to talk no matter what time of day it is if I am awake and I am not working. (My shifts are usually 3am -11am or 4am-12pm) Not only does it keep it a private conversation, but it allows your roommate to sleep. He doesn\u2019t need headphones or earplugs. You need to show compassion and consideration of your roommate. Yeah you pay a part of the rent. I pay rent too. But you will never see me on the phone in my room where people can hear me. My voice carries throughout the house so I am aware and always considerate of others.", "YTA for so many reasons here. First of all, frequently waking someone up in the middle of the night and taking no steps whatsoever to mitigate the problem. Secondly, you're not a therapist or psychologist, if your friend truly needs 24-7 access to someone to talk to, they need someone more experienced to help them. Otherwise, they can understand that, at night, your phone will be on silent. Thirdly, why would you ask your roommate to ask the apartment complex for openings for your friend instead of just doing it yourself, if you'd do it for him? Fourthly, your argument is that you pay for the bedroom too and have the right to use the space--sure, but your roommate ALSO pays for the bedroom and ALSO has the right to use the space, AND has the right to expect uninterrupted sleep. Sleep disruptions CAUSE mental health and physical health problems, so in your concern for your long distance friend's well-being, you're throwing your roommate/friend's well-being by the wayside. You do not get to ask your roommate to wear earplugs every night which would be uncomfortable and prevent them hearing their alarm clock or fire alarms etc just so your long-distance friend doesn't have to either text message you or wait til a reasonable time of day to hear from you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're awake anyhow, you could text with your friend instead of voice calls, or you could step outside away from other people's sleeping areas to talk, and keep your phone on vibrate. If you are worried you won't notice the phone vibrations, get a smart watch and keep THAT on vibrate too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you need to frequently be talking on the phone at night, you need a living situation where you won't be disrupting other people's sleep.", "YTA\n\nWear earbuds/airpods so the ring doesn\u2019t wake your roomie.\n\nCall your pal to check on her so the phone doesn\u2019t have to ring.\n\n*You* ask property management whether there are upcoming vacancies.\n\nYou can support your pal without annoying your roommate", "YTA. You could at least put it on vibrate and under your pillow", "YTA\n\nYou start by calling this guy your friend but by the end he is relegated to just roommate. You clearly have no respect for him or the supposed friendship you had. \nYou say you have the right to use the space as you are paying for the room aswell. This is true, but your roommate isn't saying you can't talk to your friend. Just simply asking you to be considerate and have your phone on vibrate so he doesn't wake up. You can still continue your late night calls without waking him. You've a very selfish attitude towards the whole situation and are likely going to end up with noone to share with in future.", "YTA. you're commitment to your friend is fine. but your roommate didn't commit, and you shouldn't force him to follow your \"rules\" as if he did. that's really selfish, imho.\n\nput you phone on silent and create a plan b to go talk somewhere else when other friend calls. you roommate does NOT need to include your friend in his life just because you did. he's right to be disgruntled. you're not married .. you don't come as a package deal. he gets to make his own decisions unrelated to you, and if you want to keep him as a roommate, you have to accept this.", "YTA big time. You expect him to do you a favor and help you out yet you can't do HIM a favor and put your phone on vibrate and leave the room when you need to talk to this girl. And further more you're pissed off by his opinion (which is probably spot on), but what did you expect him to think when he's forced to overhear your late night chats? You're being selfish, and if he is your friend then you need to treat him like one and give a little instead of expecting him to constantly give for you, especially when YOU'RE being the inconvenience.", "just..just go outside? YTA.", "YTA. So damn disrespectful. I had a roommate during college who did this and it\u2019s insane.", "YTA", "YTA and I can\u2019t imagine a world in which it\u2019s not unanimous here. You\u2019re intolerable and I hope roommate kicks you out.", "I laughed when you said you think he\u2019s starting to resent you and your friend. What gave that away? The fact he told you he doesn\u2019t like getting woken up in the middle of the night and you pretty much said I don\u2019t care? YTA", "Anyone else think this is the friend who calls and not the actual roommate?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes, letting your phone ring to where it wakes someone else in a different room up, is AH behavior.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA", "And the solution is so simple! \u201cI\u2019m sharing a room so my phone needs to be on silent at night. Text me when you want to talk. I\u2019ll move to a common area and call you back.", "Disturbing is the right word. OP needs to live alone so she/he can be at her/his  needy friends beck and call without bothering others. What an asshole. YTA", "Yeah room mate probably doesn't want her living there because he *knows* that this woman is going to be showing up at all hours of the night, banging on their door demanding to talk to OP. No thanks, I wouldn't want that either.", "Also, the friend who is constantly calling needs to see a therapist, not call friends in the middle of the night. Every once in awhile? Fine. OP can step out and be there for their friend. Frequently? No. This is a dysfunctional relationship and OP should be getting some space from this friend, not trying to move the friend closer to them.\n\nMental health stuff is hard, but leaning on another person, a friend in another city, isn't a solution. It's a crutch that will burn you out, OP.", "This. Adding my YTA", "My thoughts to a T! Phone on vibrate, leave the room to talk.", "THIS RIGHT HERE. To me the most important question is why she can't leave the room when friend calls. There seems to be no explanation for this at all, which suggests to me that OP just thinks she is 100% in the right.  I just don't get it. YTA ...SMH.", "Or they could message each other and make phone calls only for civilized hours.", "Completely agree here.\n\nYTA", "I\u2019d discover a fondness for polka and bagpipe music just when roommate\u2019s head hit the pillow.", "\nYour comment has been removed for being unhelpful and offtopic.
