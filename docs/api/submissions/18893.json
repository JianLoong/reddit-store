None of us have kids (we are child free intentionally), and all of us are in our 30s. We all live within a few blocks from one another and see each other weekly for get togethers. Recently, we had planned an event where we all were going to go tubing on a nearby river (a few of us have done this in the past already). This consists of 4 hours on the river, you all tie together and bring coolers for drinks and snacks, and this does always include liquor.\n\nI looked at the event page today and noticed someone as a host whom I had never met before. So, I asked the other host who it was, and she explained it was the wife of another friend of theirs. She then went on to say that they also intended on bringing their oldest son (under 15 years old). I responded with, \"Oh. That is unfortunate, but I appreciate the heads up.\" She continued on and said they requested PG-10 behavior from us, nothing overly sexual and no heavy drinking. I responded with, \"I don't have anything nice to say about that request, so I'll keep my mouth shut\", I did not keep my mouth shut lol. She then said if it didn't work that they could arrange a different date with them.\n\nThis is where I think things got a little dicey. I continued with saying, \"I just think if you're going to bring one child to an adult activity/gathering, you shouldn't request or expect them to cater to your child. I think that is silly. I think I would prefer to just go with you guys another time honestly. I didn't realize the extent of the trip being child friendly. I hope that's okay?\" She went on to say, \"We can do a different date with them. I guess I thought tubing was an overall child-friendly thing and not being shit-faced was a goal for this tubing trip anyway. I guess I misunderstood that the group tubing was supposed to be an adult version.\"\n\nHer and I went back and forth a little bit after this, I told her I felt it was selfish of them to go tubing with a group of adults, all of which don't have kids except them, and they expect us to not use certain verbiage, especially when I know alcohol will be involved regardless of level of drunkenness (last year we had an incident with one female not even being able to swim because of how drunk she was so being \"shit faced\" is not the goal).  I reminded her it didn't bother me at all to go another date. She finished the conversation with saying her partner invited the couple and they didn't think the couple having a child should exclude them from hanging out with the group nor did they think it was a selfish request from them that we just try to be s little more consider around their child.\n\nSo... am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I wanted to add that the couple with the child were not in the plans originally, and no one had said anything until I brought this up and asked who they were. It would be one thing for the host to clarify with the group that they were gonna invite someone with kids OR giving the couple a heads up about it being an adult gathering in case the parent didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate. \n\nEdit 2: There is no concern for our safety with alcohol consumption and drunkennesses this time around.

You're fully allowed to not want to do the event dry, but your reasoning that you've known this group for 10 years and this is how you always is probably the flip side of her logic too: she's known you all for 10 years, and your group had a safety scare the previous year, so she thought it wouldn't be a huge stretch to change it a bit.

Tubing down a river on a Saturday afternoon is a reasonable to be open.\n\n2. Good people know good people. If your friend group is so tight, you should inherently trust that anyone they invite is good people. Either this individual needs to make new friends or the organizer wants you all to meet them. In either case, you trust them.\n\nYou fail both these with your stance. Your reasons are that you can\u2019t get shit-faded and you can\u2019t be sexually crass.

It\u2019s like if someone wanted to take their kids to a house party where people will be drinking, making out (or more), and doing all sorts of other things. Would you take someone that age to a college party? No? Good.\n\nAlso the they said \u201cunder 15\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with that.", "The kid is 10, and you sound immature", "Did you not read my 2nd part? Did she know she was with a group of \"intentionally childless 30 year olds\"? \n\nShe may have been a bit tone deaf, but she wasn't an AH.", "[deleted]", "Just say you\u2019re an entitled parent.", "It\u2019s almost assuredly not legal in any part of the states either.", "I didn't want to rant but if the kid is being described as \"under 15\" and the parents asked for \"pg-10,\" that's a pretty big gap in age, I wouldn't call an 10-11 year old \"under 15.\" I wouldn't put folding money on it but I'm just imagining this is a homeschooled kid who has to go everywhere with their parents. \n\n\nAs others have said, what kid would want to hang out with a bunch of strange adults for hours on end on a river? Assuming the kid is around 13, why wouldn't the parents just let the kid stay home or go to a friend's house for a few hours?\n\n\nIt's all speculation but I've just got a feeling these are the most annoying kind of overprotective hover parents who get in the way of their kid having a life, which results in them getting in the way of those around them being able to let loose and have a good time", "In the case of my friend's parents, it was religion, which shouldn't come as a shock to anybody. Nice people, the mom became widowed and loosened up a lot as we all got older, but I remember my friend being scared to watch \"signs\" at my house when we were in middle school because he was scared of his parents finding out, meanwhile I would go to another friend's house and watch \"American pie\". My parents were fine with pretty much anything short of excessive nudity when we were at a young age. I remember 11 year old me watching \"jarhead\" with my mom and then the masturbation scene came up \ud83d\ude05", "You sure got a pretty mouth \n\n(Sorry. Could not overlook the Deliverance vibe.)", "Paddle faster!", "Tubing to me isn\u2019t a float down the river. Where I\u2019m from tubing involves taking out a boat with tubes on the back going through the wake, so there is a person with a boat that would be \u201chost\u201d", "Idk, sounds like the same kind of tubing we do down here in Texas and I just got back from taking my 3 year old and my 6 month old. It was a good time. But I'm also not overly pressed about them seeing adults drinking and having a good time.", "It's not a college-aged party. It's a gathering of middle-aged individuals in a public place. (Where other people and children will more than likely be)", "I think it's fine if they don't want a teenager at their party, but floating a river in a public place is not the same as a college house party. \n\nOP shouldn't be doing anything too NSFW (definitely nothing sexually explicit) because there will be other people there who did NOT consent to seeing that. Anyone who goes to a house party expects some level of indecency, but people neither expect nor want to see anything inappropriate when they take their family to float the river.", "I read your passive aggressive second bit, yeah", "Lol I spend 40+ hours every week filtering the hell out of myself. It's pretty entitled to expect people you don't know to change everything about an excursion so that you can bring a kid. Not all events are intended for children, and children shouldn't be inserted into the ones that are specifically for adults. \n\nThe are plenty of things I'd rather not do than do with a group that includes kids.", "Lol. I bet you have kids.", "To you.  It\u2019s boring TO YOU.  Not everyone shares the same feelings on every topic.", "i dunno. some people talk about sports. so. could be worse. yta, but not being up for a kid friendly day is not the problem, it\u2019s the way you chose to express it.", "It's just so condescending to act like finding sex more interesting than finances and gutters makes you somehow more mature?  My partner and I are closing on our first home this month and I sure as hell hope I don't start finding my gutters more interesting than his dick.  I'll sell the damn house if that happens.\n\nSeriously I have plenty of friends who are homeowners, who absolutely are not boring as shit and definitely fuck.  Some of them are in their 60s and would just leave if someone started droning on about work, finances, and home repairs.  \n\nSome people are just dead before they die I guess.", "It's absolutely legal in the states.", "Appropriate to the setting; I\u2019ll allow it. \ud83e\ude95", "Burt saw a lot of action everyday, if I understand things correctly \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49", "Was he your spirit guide?", "Lol it wasn't passive aggressive or judgemental in any way.  If this lady doesn't know this group, it's very reasonable to think that maybe a group of 30 years wouldn't care. It's not like it's a group of 20s college kids or something.\n\nEdit: It would be very dense for the lady to suggest a kid come along with a group of 20s college kids because it's obvious that it would be unwelcome. It's not obvious that 30 year olds would have the same opinion. She backed off once they expressed they weren't interested though, so it clearly wasn't some weird sense of entitlement of ruining their trip.", "As an adult WITH children, I can firmly agree. Im not talking about sex the entire time but there's definitely less relaxing going on because I'm always worried about the kids. I do think OP could've gone about it slightly different but overall she's NTA. I need my occasional child free outings. Idk why other parents get up in arms about it", "I would never willingly talk about finances lol but OP makes it seem like all her friends wanna talk about is sex, and I've had friends like that. It just gets super boring and repetitive", "I truly didn't mean for it to be condescending, it just seems like some people in this thread seem pretty defensive that people would have the audacity to find things like finances interesting to talk about. I have sex just fine I just don't need to announce it all day long. I'm not sure why talking about a lot of different topics is boring but so many people are defending that OPs group talking about one topic over and over again can't possibly be boring.", "I\u2019ve done this in many states and it\u2019s never been actually legal. Most people just don\u2019t know it, or don\u2019t bother to care.", "Well there\u2019s the judgment: you think it\u2019s \u201c20 year old\u201d behavior to be bothered", "You truly sounds insufferable. Why does this matter so much to you?", "Maybe they're all super kinky little sluts and that's why they like each other?", "It just seems like a lot of people are telling OP that they're TA and immature for finding these topics interesting in the first place. I guess I was turning it around on these big responsible adults because the simple fact is, your interests are not an indicator of your maturity.  My closest friends and I talk about video games, cartoons, poop, politics, and therapy lmao. I'm not even one to talk when it comes to being boring.\n\nWhether OPs interests are cool or mature wasn't even the question at hand.  If someone works all week and manages their home, along with all the other bs that comes along with being an adult, I think it's reasonable to want to float down a river while you get drunk and talk about sex with your friends without some random telling you to watch your mouth.  What's not reasonable is telling an entire group of adults that they have to change their behavior because you're bringing your child to their recreational activity.", "No, I think it's OBVIOUS that 20 yo college kids wouldn't want a kid along on a float trip that includes drinking. It's not obvious that a group of 30 yo adults wouldn't want a kid along. I don't judge them at all (except for that OP thinks it's obvious that they wouldn't want it and goes out of his way to shame the lady for even considering it). I'm in my 30s with 3 kids of my own and if I had a chance to go on a drinking float trip with just adults, I would NOT want some random kid along. It's just not obvious that I wouldn't want that.", "Lol why would a group of 30 year olds, especially intentionally child-free ones, want to hang out with a kid when they\u2019re drinking and relaxing??"]}
