None of us have kids (we are child free intentionally), and all of us are in our 30s. We all live within a few blocks from one another and see each other weekly for get togethers. Recently, we had planned an event where we all were going to go tubing on a nearby river (a few of us have done this in the past already). This consists of 4 hours on the river, you all tie together and bring coolers for drinks and snacks, and this does always include liquor.\n\nI looked at the event page today and noticed someone as a host whom I had never met before. So, I asked the other host who it was, and she explained it was the wife of another friend of theirs. She then went on to say that they also intended on bringing their oldest son (under 15 years old). I responded with, \"Oh. That is unfortunate, but I appreciate the heads up.\" She continued on and said they requested PG-10 behavior from us, nothing overly sexual and no heavy drinking. I responded with, \"I don't have anything nice to say about that request, so I'll keep my mouth shut\", I did not keep my mouth shut lol. She then said if it didn't work that they could arrange a different date with them.\n\nThis is where I think things got a little dicey. I continued with saying, \"I just think if you're going to bring one child to an adult activity/gathering, you shouldn't request or expect them to cater to your child. I think that is silly. I think I would prefer to just go with you guys another time honestly. I didn't realize the extent of the trip being child friendly. I hope that's okay?\" She went on to say, \"We can do a different date with them. I guess I thought tubing was an overall child-friendly thing and not being shit-faced was a goal for this tubing trip anyway. I guess I misunderstood that the group tubing was supposed to be an adult version.\"\n\nHer and I went back and forth a little bit after this, I told her I felt it was selfish of them to go tubing with a group of adults, all of which don't have kids except them, and they expect us to not use certain verbiage, especially when I know alcohol will be involved regardless of level of drunkenness (last year we had an incident with one female not even being able to swim because of how drunk she was so being \"shit faced\" is not the goal).  I reminded her it didn't bother me at all to go another date. She finished the conversation with saying her partner invited the couple and they didn't think the couple having a child should exclude them from hanging out with the group nor did they think it was a selfish request from them that we just try to be s little more consider around their child.\n\nSo... am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I wanted to add that the couple with the child were not in the plans originally, and no one had said anything until I brought this up and asked who they were. It would be one thing for the host to clarify with the group that they were gonna invite someone with kids OR giving the couple a heads up about it being an adult gathering in case the parent didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate. \n\nEdit 2: There is no concern for our safety with alcohol consumption and drunkennesses this time around.

You're fully allowed to not want to do the event dry, but your reasoning that you've known this group for 10 years and this is how you always is probably the flip side of her logic too: she's known you all for 10 years, and your group had a safety scare the previous year, so she thought it wouldn't be a huge stretch to change it a bit.

In either case, you trust them.\n\nYou fail both these with your stance. Your reasons are that you can\u2019t get shit-faded and you can\u2019t be sexually crass.

Sounds like they want to talk about sex, maybe engage in some not so SFW behavior, and drink. 15 year olds might be \u201csuper fun\u201d (to you) but they definitely don\u2019t belong at this kind of event. It\u2019s like if someone wanted to take their kids to a house party where people will be drinking, making out (or more), and doing all sorts of other things.

Assuming the kid is around 13, why wouldn't the parents just let the kid stay home or go to a friend's house for a few hours?\n\n\nIt's all speculation but I've just got a feeling these are the most annoying kind of overprotective hover parents who get in the way of their kid having a life, which results in them getting in the way of those around them being able to let loose and have a good time", "In the case of my friend's parents, it was religion, which shouldn't come as a shock to anybody. Nice people, the mom became widowed and loosened up a lot as we all got older, but I remember my friend being scared to watch \"signs\" at my house when we were in middle school because he was scared of his parents finding out, meanwhile I would go to another friend's house and watch \"American pie\".

I'm not even one to talk when it comes to being boring.\n\nWhether OPs interests are cool or mature wasn't even the question at hand.  If someone works all week and manages their home, along with all the other bs that comes along with being an adult, I think it's reasonable to want to float down a river while you get drunk and talk about sex with your friends without some random telling you to watch your mouth.

You just say \u201chey, I don\u2019t think this trip is for me cause I wanna be able to cut loose. We can plan for an adult only trip next time\u201d.\n\nEdited to add: Entitlement does go both ways. It sounds like most of your trips are child-free, and this time someone invited the couple and their child.

Will the kid have fun? Doubt it. But secondly, your friend offered to arrange another date with the couple and kid, you could\u2019ve just agreed to that.

It was embarrassing. My parents were kind of like your friend group though, no censoring, it was just the fact I was brought on specifically adult trips all the time.

If I were this couple I'd have wanted everyone in the group to discuss beforehand if they wanted a kid in tow, and I wouldn't ask them to modify their behaviour, assuming that behaviour didn't involve public sex.

Plus, I'm leaning towards when the other couple was invited, they probably asked if it was ok if their kid joined them. The girl said there'd be heavy drinking and lewd behavior, and the couple (being normal parents) were probably put off but polite enough to say maybe they'd go another time then. The girl said \"let me ask the group if they can keep it civil,\" and voila. I dunno, total guess but seems way more likely than what OP is describing.\n\nAlso, this whole \"omg kids exist?!\" attitude is crazy to me.", "Except they aren't asking them to act in a way that's appropriate for a 15 year old. They're asking for PG10. There's a world of difference between those two numbers.

Alcohol is involved more often than not, and everyone leaves the river the same way they came. If you want to have a child friendly float you need to explicitly plan that because when the adults come out to play, they do indeed play. Nothing wrong with it.

It's just nice to be able to loosen up and relax and not have kids around", "Here's the thing, location does not matter if the original plan was adults only especially if it was something that was done fairly regularly among friends. As an example, I periodically go on camping trips with friends it is adults only. If suddenly someone new joined in and wanted to bring a kid, especially a young one, that would probably be a no-go.   \n\n\nIt isn't just about enjoying alcohol, weed or language. The kid means that a lot of things that people might have felt comfortable discussing due to mutual trust, etc. they probably wouldn't feel comfortable doing now. The kid also can mean that suddenly the group needs to worry about being dragooned into being babysitters or entertaining the kid. It means that things we had planned to do (Tomahawk throwing, cards against humanity, etc.) are probably not going to be appropriate or as safe to do with the kid around.   \n\n\nThe other problem is that as the people with teh kid don't seem to be known to the larger group they also are going to be less likely to know what their limits are. Also, the trip/excursion is meant to be an excursion where we can relax and blow off steam having to censor ourselves isn't conducive to that especially if the kid is particularly young.

Your kid, your problem.", "The kid is under 15. PG-10 isn't even a thing. It's ridiculous. Guarantee the kid is way too young for this kind of activity and will either be miserable or super annoying.

Maybe everyone used to drink the same and be just as vulgar but now some people in the group are maturing and looking for different types of hangouts. Assess the situation before you end up being the only holdout who starts to look obnoxious and out of step. People change over time and group dynamics change too. You know for sure that some of your friends didn't see anything problematic with having a kid join so it's time to pay attention to this. \n\nAs for the communication part, you should work on that. You know you were communicating like an asshole. Think about why you think it's ok to talk like that to your friends and find better ways to resolve disagreements. There was no reason for this to escalate like that.

The other adults involved could spend the entire day overly cautious and trying to \u201cwatch\u201d everything they say and do, and those aren\u2019t really the hallmarks of a fun, relaxing activity. It also feels like the \u201chost\u201d was trying to be sneaky about it and wouldn\u2019t have even given the other adults fair warning that they were expected to be on their best behavior.

That\u2019s the real issue here. I don\u2019t think the other person did anything wrong by \u201cgetting invited on a trip\u201d and \u201casking adults not to swear around their child\u201d. The real issue is they never should have been invited in the first place without the groups okay, at which point the group has to deal with a kid they invited being along. Since the group never okayed it (or at least OP didn\u2019t, I\u2019d love to know what the other 4 people thought as OP never says that I can see), that\u2019s the problem part.", "Yep. If this person doesn\u2019t get why this friend group goes tubing and wants to control their conversation, I\u2019m guessing they wouldn\u2019t understand a single second of the Simpsons", "But that\u2019s the thing, you can\u2019t assume that. That\u2019s literally asshole behavior. Imagine if you had an event planned, and that one family member you hated was invited because your mother assumed that you wouldn\u2019t mind because it\u2019s family. It\u2019s asshole behavior and they shouldn\u2019t just assume something like that. You know a friend might have a problem with it, THATS the person you need to tell the most because that\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nAnd only OP seems offended by it probably because she talked with the host friend in private. We don\u2019t know if the others would be or not but just the fact that they didn\u2019t mention anything either, I believe that no one was told this. If it\u2019s a group event, don\u2019t just assume things. Not really related, but a relative example would be assuming that no one has allergies and not asking beforehand, then poisoning someone with peanuts. Totally not like the scenario at all, but see what assuming can do. That is totally asshole behavior from host friend. That\u2019s why my stance is ESH.", "Even most of us in California know what this means", "Agreed. I\u2019ll be reading the post, thinking to myself, clearly this person is an AH, and then be completely floored when all the top comments or NTA. Like what!!", "No, we don\u2019t know when, but does it really matter? When you\u2019re planning a trip with a group of friends, you do not blindly invite someone without getting the okay of the group. \n\nI agree with you that I don\u2019t think the invitee is being selfish at all. I don\u2019t see how that person did anything wrong, they were invited on a trip by a friend and requested people tone down their language, which the group can accept or not. But I think the real problem is the friend who is inviting people behind the backs of others in the group, including someone that completely changes the dynamic of the trip. The only thing I\u2019m unclear on is if friend did this behind everyone\u2019s back, or if OP has a very, VERY different idea of what the trip is from everyone else, and the other people in the group were already asked and said yes. A kind of \u201cOP is more extreme than everyone else and they didn\u2019t know how to tell her, so they just invited the person\u201d situation.", ">They were invited on the outing by someone who appears to have told them it was fine\n\nI think that person is the one who really messed up here. \n\n>I personally wouldn\u2019t mind if someone brought that up to me.\n\nNeither would I, however I do see how bringing a kid would kill the vibe for many. Especially if specifically told to tone things down to accomodate. \n\n>To be clear I think the friend is the real problem here unless there\u2019s missing info, as they seem to have invited someone on the trip plus their kid without asking anyone. That\u2019s the real issue here.\n\nJust got to this part of your response, and we're in full agreement. I think that person realized their mistake after the op's response.", "You know I appreciate that! I\u2019m about to be 32 and while I feel behind my peers, I try to remember I got myself through college and have been living on my own since. \n\nNo resentment luckily! I was an odd little duck. I was born with a healthy sense of self (which I recently got back after a depression; but it\u2019s weird to think you were more secure with yourself a a child than an adult but that\u2019s trauma) and this natural understanding of emotion, behavior, and healthy boundaries. When she was irrational and lashed out, I knew it was at no fault of mine. So I never carried that burden of taking it personally (though there was still pleeeenty of toxic emotional labor and trauma to go around). For the first time in my life, I do feel like i\u2019m starting to thrive", "I appreciate that! I got to be at my dad\u2019s house a few times a week which DEF helped. My mom really is a wonderful person with a good heart; but everyone has their demons and she wasn\u2019t doing anything to manage them. She projects a lot onto me so I always got it the worst. That place was an prison but I (and my sister) ESCAAAAAPED! I was she first in my extended family to attend and graduate college. Thank jeebus I was basically born an old school who was grounded and understood emotional regulation and healthy boundaries.\nI was the only emotionally mature one in the house and functioned as the adult. Somehow also managed to pass these skill sets to my little sister. She graduated college with honors and is a nurse at a prestigious hospital.\n\n(Mind you, I have CPTSD and went through a major depressive episode to process and beal my trauma to achieve secure attachment; and my sister has some anxiety. still relatively unscathed all things considered)", "Either the kid has already been exposed to anything OP and friends would be saying or he's pretty sheltered. Welcome to the age of the internet in 2023. If they have access to it or access to friends with access to it, they know all the bad words and concepts.", "It wasnt all during high school.  The preppy kids were raised that way since elementary school.   I was classmates/schoolmates with them for the entirety of Kindergarten through grade 12.\n\n\nEdit: i was friends with violin preppy guy for a while in like 1st or second grade, until he got too high and mighty about NOT owning a TV.  Literally would get a smug look on his face and act like not owning a TV made him better than you\n\n\nEdit 2:  god i didnt think this would make me remember so much about this.   Its like remembering one thing unlocks another and that unlocks another.   \n\n\nViolin guy also wasnt allowed action figures or board games.   I got him a board game for his birthday one year and his parents took it away and later gave it back to my parents when we left because he wasnt allowed board games.   \n\n\n\nThe only \u201ctoys\u201d he was allowed were those mind-training toys where youre trying to slide wood blocks together to take them apart/put them together, or trying to move metal rings and rods in a specific way to separate them.   And Legos, luckily he was allowed Legos.   He wasnt allowed most themed sets, like Harry Potter or Ninja Turtles, but he was allowed more basic/realistic themes like the \u201cCity\u201d theme, Space stuff like the Rocket Ship, and idk if they were around at the time (im 25 now) but he would have been allowed the Architect line where its the Eiffel Tower and stuff like that.", "It does matter because this friend has a life and responsibilities outside of organizing this outing. Maybe she was going to tell OP and she hadn\u2019t gotten around to it yet because she\u2019s busy with other things. Also, I find it hard to believe that a group that\u2019s carefree enough to get drunk by a river and uses vulgar language regularly in conversations would be so uptight that they would insist their friend get clearance from them before inviting someone outside of their group on an outing. OP doesn\u2019t mention what her other friends think of this which makes me think that OP is the one that doesn\u2019t want the vibes of these get togethers to change.", "Waaaaaaooooooow\n\u2026.So that\u2019s why I\u2019m this way", "Allllll of this right here!", "As someone who was a sheltered kid growing up, I can confirm the lack of impulse control that went into my young adult life and even into my early 30's. At 35 now, I am better, but it has taken a lot of work to get there. \n\nWhen you're not \"allowed/permitted\" anything because of fear of consequences from your over protective parents, you  cut loose once those consequences are non-existent.", "I plan on being the parent that will pick up my kid no questions asked, just to know he gets home from his fuckshit safe. Will allow my son when he becomes of age to experiment as long as he shows maturity, and keeps his grades up and life together. \n\n\nMy parents had a saying that they'd give me enough rope to hang myself with, and it came with the implication of them reigning me in if they felt like they needed to. They'd let me have a beer or 2 before it was legal but they wouldn't buy it for me. My dad knew I smoked weed and even had my back for me a few times and just would tell me not to let my mom find out, and never sell it. I went quite a bit further than that in my late teens and early 20s but didn't disappear into any of it. They knew me and my brother would do that stuff elsewhere but they didn't ever prod about it. I remember watching one of the Halloween movies at 6 and the mummy at 5. Had goldeneye at 6-7 and grand theft auto 3 around 10 I bet. I was far from sheltered and I think my parents set reasonable limits because they wanted to let us be stupid kids so we could have fun, but it was allowed because we kept our shit together"]}
