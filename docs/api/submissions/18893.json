None of us have kids (we are child free intentionally), and all of us are in our 30s. We all live within a few blocks from one another and see each other weekly for get togethers. Recently, we had planned an event where we all were going to go tubing on a nearby river (a few of us have done this in the past already). This consists of 4 hours on the river, you all tie together and bring coolers for drinks and snacks, and this does always include liquor.\n\nI looked at the event page today and noticed someone as a host whom I had never met before. So, I asked the other host who it was, and she explained it was the wife of another friend of theirs. She then went on to say that they also intended on bringing their oldest son (under 15 years old). I responded with, \"Oh. That is unfortunate, but I appreciate the heads up.\" She continued on and said they requested PG-10 behavior from us, nothing overly sexual and no heavy drinking. I responded with, \"I don't have anything nice to say about that request, so I'll keep my mouth shut\", I did not keep my mouth shut lol. She then said if it didn't work that they could arrange a different date with them.\n\nThis is where I think things got a little dicey. I continued with saying, \"I just think if you're going to bring one child to an adult activity/gathering, you shouldn't request or expect them to cater to your child. I think that is silly. I think I would prefer to just go with you guys another time honestly. I didn't realize the extent of the trip being child friendly. I hope that's okay?\" She went on to say, \"We can do a different date with them. I guess I thought tubing was an overall child-friendly thing and not being shit-faced was a goal for this tubing trip anyway. I guess I misunderstood that the group tubing was supposed to be an adult version.\"\n\nHer and I went back and forth a little bit after this, I told her I felt it was selfish of them to go tubing with a group of adults, all of which don't have kids except them, and they expect us to not use certain verbiage, especially when I know alcohol will be involved regardless of level of drunkenness (last year we had an incident with one female not even being able to swim because of how drunk she was so being \"shit faced\" is not the goal).  I reminded her it didn't bother me at all to go another date. She finished the conversation with saying her partner invited the couple and they didn't think the couple having a child should exclude them from hanging out with the group nor did they think it was a selfish request from them that we just try to be s little more consider around their child.\n\nSo... am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I wanted to add that the couple with the child were not in the plans originally, and no one had said anything until I brought this up and asked who they were. It would be one thing for the host to clarify with the group that they were gonna invite someone with kids OR giving the couple a heads up about it being an adult gathering in case the parent didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate. \n\nEdit 2: There is no concern for our safety with alcohol consumption and drunkennesses.

I'm pretty introverted, but as far as I know it's not very unusual to invite new friends to an event coming up that you think will be appropriate to expand.

You're fully allowed to not want to do the event dry, but your reasoning that you've known this group for 10 years and this is how you always is probably the flip side of her logic too: she's known you all for 10 years, and your group had a safety scare the previous year, so she thought it wouldn't be a huge stretch to change it a bit.

I feel like she was told that her son was allowed to come by whoever added them,  just no one told you. Also, you said that she said they would go with them a different day pretty quickly. Why were you still so angry at her when she told you she wasn't going anymore? I don't think she was trying to be selfish, I think it was an honest miscommunication and she really didn't know anyone was against them coming. Like kind of oblivious to what actually takes place on a tubing trip\n\nI've been tubing before, there's NO way that it's gonna stay PG anything after the first 2 hours tops \ud83e\udd23 Definitely not a surprise family friendly activity cuz you already have a set vibe in place. Kids there is a whooole different mentality\n\nETA for anyone who doesn't know, tubing has the same vibe as camping since you're on the river for so long, surround by nature.

There are many adults who don\u2019t drink a lot or use vulgar language so they had no way of knowing that their request would kill the entire vibe of the day. I\u2019m in the same age range as you and your friends and if someone made this request of my friend group, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem because we don\u2019t act like that even when there aren\u2019t kids around.
