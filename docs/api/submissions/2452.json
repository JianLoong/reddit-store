Mind you I had already moved some stuff in and locked before I left. I\u2019m assuming the property manager unlocked it for whoever stored their stuff in my unit to move their stuff out.

Document everything. Then report to the management company what the pm did. Take pictures of all the stuff in the apartment. Have them reclean the apartment and then discount your rent.", "You rent should be prorated as the unit is obviously not available. There should be a walkthough with both you and the property management team member to note anything to protect your security deposit. Or at least, a report should be made available in a timely manner (within a day or so) of you actually taking possession of the unit, so you can note any discrepancies.\n\nI would be SCREAMING, because this is just so wrong on just so many levels.\n\nFWIW, I have been a landlord for the apartment in my house for years and this just screams of future problems.", "Take pictures. Document your communications. They have breached you lease. TBH i would do anything I can to nullify the lease and not move in. \n\nI would not move anything. They now need to prorate first month since the place isn\u2019t ready for move in as stated by the lease. It is their problem to fix. Do you have friends or family who can help you navigate this situation?\n\nEDIT: Huh? How do you expect them to clean the apartment after you\u2019ve already started moving stuff in with someone\u2019s rando stuff in there? You have unfortunately put yourself in a difficult position. Once you\u2019ve moved in, landlord needs to give you 24hr notice to enter the property. This is really unsafe for you. Still document everything and take pictures of how you\u2019re receiving the apartment.\n\nYTA to yourself right now for accepting this apartment.", "NTA - But, if you can, take your things out until this gets resolved. Take pictures with a date stamp and send emails to the property manager so you can establish a document trail. You'll want all of this if you go to move out and they try to charge you a cleaning fee when they didn't give you a clean place to begin with. Also if you're able get a rental lawyer to send them a notice that rent will not be paid until the unit is actually available and you are not responsible for the time you could not occupy the unit.", "Omg NTA but you should probably not move in\u2026. This screams your rights will be violated the entire time you reside in this property.", "NTA\n\nThe property manager had plenty of time to have the apartment ready for you to move in. What she's allowing is unacceptable.\n\nLook into your lease if there's anything you can do, including any deposits.", "NTA you're on the right side of this legally and morally. There's no excuse for the apartment being ready when it was promised. I would consider finding a new apartment, but if that's not feasible be sure to get your rent prorated plus any extra costs you incur. And document EVERYTHING.", "I would take dated pictures of the apartment ASAP, preferably the date you were supposed to move in. Insurance against them keeping your deposit when you move out. Also since you are essentially sharing the apartment I would request them to pro rate the rent. \n\nYou have a point about the cleaning, all this crap and traffic does negate the cleaning. It might be worth it to go above the property managers head. She could be collecting money for storage in your apartment. It doesn't ever hurt to ask.", "NTA. The property manger is violated the terms of your lease agreement. You\u2019re within your rights to move all the items out of the unit. \n\nFurthermore, change the locks on your door (you might need approval depending on your lease). Someone has access to your unit that you do not know.", "I'd be breaking lease immediately, or id lwt my new neighbors know i will be moving stuff out into the hallway as I move my stuff in.", "Nta and huge red flag that someone let themselves into the place without your permission after you started moving in. I'd be finding somewhere else to live.", "I would notify the property manager that if the stuff isn't out of the unit by 9am tomorrow morning, you will be putting it out on the curb. I would take whatever stuff you have in there with you so it doesn't get taken in the meantime. Then, in the morning, after putting the stuff out if you have to, I would change the locks and move in. Keep the old locks to put back once you move out but I wouldn't feel secure in that apartment without changing the locks. \n\nBest of luck to you. The property manager sounds like a jerk.", "NTA for being pissed.\n\nYou need to consult an attorney, and/or talk to the local housing authority that oversees this.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a signed lease, then I would argue that whatever\u2019s left in the apartment is now under your control.\n\nThe apartment is not clean and in move-in ready condition.  Since you\u2019ve found the apartment unsecured, you have no idea what condition it\u2019s in.  Demand an inspection, then a cleaning.\n\nSince your name is now on the lease, I\u2019d also start demanding your landlord notify you before entering the apartment.\n\nI\u2019m not a lawyer, but in some cases, if the landlord can\u2019t provide the agreed upon property, it\u2019s up to them to provide an alternate place for you to stay. (That might mean a hotel for a few days, but at least you\u2019ll have a door that locks.)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
