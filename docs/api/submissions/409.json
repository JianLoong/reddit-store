This isn't a professional matter you need to deal with, as you don't mention any evidence or even suspicion that it's had a real impact on your professional reputation. This is personal for you. A professional acquaintance really offended you and it's been bothering you for years. It's not reasonable to expect someone who's not a friend and no longer even involved in that profession to address a personal matter from years ago.  Let it go and move on. Quit giving it space in your head, it's long over and done with.", "YTA\n\nThe moment they said they were retired, you should have ended the conversation. Also being sick is just icing on the cake.", "YTA\n\nThis happened years ago and if it was going to effect you professionally, it would have by now. You reached out to this person knowing they were retired and harassed them about it. It's time to let it go, 2 years is a long time to hold a grudge.", "Obviously you triumphed over whatever was holding you back then. Bringing it up now, especially under the circumstances, is bitter and unnecessary. YTA.\n\nNext time, either deal with it in the moment or file it away as a red flag for the person making the comment. \n\nRemember the koan of the monks' journey. Two holy monks are traveling a long way. They come to a river and see a fine lady, who asks for help in crossing. The older monk silently picks up the woman and carries her across. They continue along for hours and hours. The younger monk finally breaks their silence, blurting, \"Why? Why would you break your vow? You know we are not to touch a woman!\" And the older monk replies, \"I let her go hours ago. Why are you still carrying her?\"", "YTA. You knew this person is retired but still chose to harass them over a professional matter that happened years ago. They are no longer in that profession and don't owe you anything. Let it go.", "Nta - they made comments that could possibly damage your career expecting you not to hear about it, and when it was possible, you requested to know why. The way you addressed the situation was perfectly civil - and at the end of the day, if they didn't want to be questioned about it, they shouldn't have said it in the first place.", "YTA  \n\n\nSeems like it's been a thorn in your side since you learned of it, but has it really made any difference in the two years since it happened? Is it even objectively still relevant? Or is it just something that bugged you to the point you just felt you need to bring it up so you could address some sort of personal feeling about it? And especially since the person is sick, possibly long-term or terminally (we don't know), I can guarantee you it's not relevent to *them* anymore.", "IMO: If someone is sick or got health issues, you shouldn't \"get even\" or bother them. They're already suffering and it wouldn't really make you feel better. The guilt is forever and you'll have nightmares.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You should have asked two years ago. Being a trainee doesn't stop you from asking questions and the actions you described you took now aren't actions you couldn't have taken back then."]}
