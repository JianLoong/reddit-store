I am planning on inviting my entire family but not my eldest nephew. \n\nHe is my brothers son and honestly a real piece of work. He does not like us. Has never liked us. Is rude to everyone and can not stand us. There is definitely some parental alienation going on as his mother had no interest in the family even when she was dating my brother and then when she got pregnant with him she did everything she could to minimise us with her son. \n\nHe is rude to his cousins, his own siblings and stepmom. Because of his mom he was rarely at family events but when he was. He would misbehave, get annoyed with his dad, demand to go home and refuse to talk to anyone. \n\nFor his 11th birthday my brother  completely decked out his back garden. Giant cake, balloons, streamers, games, and a large BBQ.  My nephew threw a complete temper tantrum over it and wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone. He sat in the corner for hours and refused to talk to anyone and no one hung out with him because they all know he doesn\u2019t like them. \n\nI feel bad for my brother. I really do. He was so excited to be a dad considering our dad wasn\u2019t really that present in our lives. He has said himself he will just take a step back if things don\u2019t improve. \n\nI don\u2019t see the point of inviting a kid who hates us and probably won\u2019t even show up anyway. He never has before.

I don\u2019t totally understand the dynamics from the post though. \n\nHowever, at the end of the day you can invite who you want. NTA.", "First NTA, but there is an easy way to deal with this.  Plan the gathering on your nephew's mother's weekend and most of the problems are solved.", "NTA. I personally would invite him because  even if my nephew was a mess, I love my brother too much to hurt him. But you have the right to chose who gets to come to your kid\u2019s birthday, and if there\u2019s no way to control your nephew, then he\u2019s out.", "NTA but talk to your brother and figure out what's going on.  Has he tried to go through the court system at all to improve this?", "If nephew wouldn\u2019t show up anyway, you might as well extend the invite. \n\nIt keeps the peace with your brother, and if nephew ever realizes that this side of the fam is decent, you can always say that he was included and he never took you up on it. \n\nBut if you can schedule on moms weekend, you\u2019d be better off. \n\nAs an aside-\nI\u2019m still confused how his mom wanted nothing to do with the father of her child\u2019s family. What did she want to happen? She\u2019d raise the child alone and dad would just be ok with that?  Dad needs to get some some help so the boy can stop being so angry.", "Don't invite him, because if he does come he will ruin the party.\n\nTo all of you people trying to hold a family together against all logic: when do you finally say, Enough is enough?", "NTA: I cannot blame you one bit. Your son deserves a joyous birthday, not one wrecked by his spiteful cousin.", "This is tough. Making him feel unwanted certainly won't help, there's obviously something bigger at play here... But you also have the right to invite whoever you want, it's your son's day. \n\nNTA I guess because of that. Maybe extend the invitation but make it clear it's optional, if he doesn't want to come and enjoy the party there are no expectations for him to attend.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your issue is really with his Mom. Kid can\u2019t help it if he is constantly being told that y\u2019all suck. Poor lil dude. Your brother needs to get a handle on that problem. \n\nI think I would invite him otherwise you\u2019re just giving his mom more ammunition to use against you & hurting your brother. Maybe he could bring a friend? Maybe that would help? You\u2019re definitely not the asshole which ever way you decide. It\u2019s your son\u2019s day, you don\u2019t need to invite drama", "ESH.
