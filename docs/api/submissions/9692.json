If I had such a pissy cousin, I wouldn't want them to my awesome birthday either.\n\nIt's your son's birthday. What does he think about Cousin being there? It's not your brother or his son's birthday, but your son's. And his true feelings should be your biggest guide here. \n\nAnd do not force him or even suggest to him, your son, that it could be an olive branch.

But before doing anything, I'd have a frank talk with your brother.  Ask him how he thinks you (OP) should handle this.  See if he has any suggestions.
