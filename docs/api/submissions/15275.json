Obviously we couldn\u2019t have an engagement party because the virus hit less than a week later. We haven\u2019t gotten married yet because Dave\u2019s mom can\u2019t come back into the country yet because of a Visa issue. So to celebrate our four year engagement anniversary, Dave threw us a surprise (to me) engagement party.\n\nMy best friend of almost 20 years, \u201cMichelle\u201d (24F), was invited to give a speech. Dave and her get along great, and I love her like a sister, so I was very excited for her speech. Instead, she started quoting that TV show Ricky and Morty about how love isn\u2019t real, etc. I was very uncomfortable but thought she was trying to be funny. Afterwards, I asked her what that was about. She said that romantic love doesn\u2019t really exist and love is only real when you don\u2019t want to fuck.\n\nI just walked away and tried to enjoy my night. Dave told me she was probably trying to lighten the mood because it had gotten so sappy with PowerPoints and other speeches. The next day though, Michelle texted me, unprompted, and defended herself, saying that humans don\u2019t mate for life, it\u2019s not in our nature, etc. I just asked her to stop and she went off, saying that I was punishing her for her beliefs.\n\nAfter like a week of this, I told her that I wanted some space. She wouldn\u2019t give it so I told her she wouldn\u2019t be my MOH anymore and I wasn\u2019t sure if she was still invited. By this point she had spent NO money on my wedding except for a gift for the engagement party that I offered to return to her.\n\nWe finally have a date on when Dave\u2019s mom will be allowed a Tourist Visa so we\u2019ve started officially planning and even have a date. I feel guilty that Michelle isn\u2019t here for me to talk about everything with like we always have been, and my mom thinks maybe I should reach out, but I\u2019m still angry. Michelle also has told everyone I abandoned her for my fianc\u00e9 and what an AH I am, so am I? Should I have overlooked her little attitude problem?", "created_utc": 1681994582, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12sxg7x/aita_for_kicking_my_best_friend_out_of_my_wedding/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If so, yeah that's a *horrible* thing to say at someone's engagement party.\n\nNTA", "If this is a \"little attitude problem\" then Lincoln had a \"minor head wound\".\n\nNo, you're NTA for having some self respect.", "NTA. She clearly doesn't believe in marriage. So why should you put her as MOH. As someone who wants to help you, starting this new life? It can be her believe but she could also support you and your way of life.", "Anyone using rick and Morty for something in real life automatically becomes the AH. \nNTA", "NTA, this girl engineered her exit from the event, as well as your life.  Let her go.  You're both better off for it.", "NTA - at its core, a wedding is a celebration of love. She's entitled to her beliefs, but you don't need that kinda energy at your wedding....who knows what else she would do!!", "*I didn't abandon Michele.  She was taking every chance imaginable to talk me out of marrying my fiance and I finally just decided that I can't have someone that toxic in my life.*\n\nNTA", "NTA yeah that's not a friend it's a crazy person with an agenda. Let her go and don't look back.", "NTA. She should've saved her rant for Facebook, and given the traditional yet boring speech. Then she doubled down by texting you. You're good to be rid of her. If anyone questions why you 'abandoned' her just show them your last text from her.", "NTA. Why would you want someone in your wedding that is already hoping that it will end? No need to invite all that bad energy. Also, why her beliefs matter? What did she expected? For you to break your engagement?", "I honestly think it has more to do with jealousy than anything else. She's already spread through your friend group that you abandoned her for your fiance. She's either jealous of the relationship you have with him, jealous that you're not spending time with her, but she's developed feelings beyond friendship for either you or your fiance. NTA", "Why would she even want to be part of an event she doesn't believe in?\n\nIt's like she wants to be invited to play soccer when you already know she's just going to stab the ball and scream that games are stupid.", "NTA - Girl clearly has had her heart broken or hasn't found the right person yet, so she can't understand love. Which, by itself, is okay, but there's no need to bring others around her down too. Your wedding should be with people that support your marriage and believe in your relationship - doesn't sound like that would include her.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't believe in love, your love, or your upcoming marriage. She made a public spectacle out of her opinions when she could've just given them to you privately. How could she possibly be a part of the wedding? She also refused to honor your request for space. She might have different opinions than you, but she could still be a good friend if she wanted to be one. She's clearly not doing that so your decision is more than fair. You are not punishing her. She created this situation and lacks a lot of tact and situational awareness. I'm sorry you're experiencing this while planning our wedding. I'm sure it has to hurt not having such a long-standing friend by your side. It's not on you to reach out to her when she's done all the damage and refuses to respect your boundaries. Best wishes on your upcoming marriage!", "NTA. I think bestie is starting to feel like she\u2019s being replaced.\n\nHowever, her attitude is unacceptable and she should be happy for you that you have found happiness with a wonderful partner.", "NTA  \nMichelle is a disillusioned, far from a little attitude problem.  \nOnce you made it clear that you wanted some space, she should have respected that.  \nTry talking to her again and see if she has improved. And then maybe give her another chance.", "NGL anyone who goes out of their way to quote Rick and Morty is off my guest list. NTA, not the kind of energy you need at the wedding or while preparing for it.", "NTA. Someone can not believe in marriage and still be a good MOH, however, your friend isn't that person. There is absolutely no way that speech shoukd have been given and now she is pulling the old \"she abandoned me.for her fiance\" to cover for her bad behavior instead of apologizing.\n\nShe could either have declined to give a speech or gi en a speech not about the virtues of love, but about the virtues of you and your fiancee. A speech bashing marriage at an engagement party is not the time or place for her to proselytize to the audience about her views on love.\n\nYou wouldn't give a speech at the funeral of a  religious friend saying that you don't believe in god, heaven is a joke and your friend's soul didn't go to better place, they are just rotting in the ground. If you didn't believe, you would still be able to give an appropriate speech celebrating the person your friend was.\n\nThis is really no different.\n\nAlso, Rick and Morty quotes? So very much not the time or place.", "Did you know about her beliefs before or did she suddenly download her personality from watching too much Rick and Morty? I personally find it odd that someone with beliefs like hers should be asked to be in the bridal party in the first place but nevertheless, NTA whatsoever for kicking out someone who behaved so inappropriately and continuing to push it when you asked for space.", "NTA - I\u2019m sorry to have to tell you this but that\u2019s not a best friend. Beliefs or not you need to put those aside when you are celebrating your best friend and she didn\u2019t do it.

She sounds like she\u2019s going through something on her end that\u2019s making her averse to love, but it\u2019s absolutely not okay for her to take that out on you. It\u2019s okay to be sad about a longtime friendship ending and wishing they were still in your life, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to reach out or keep her in your life. If she\u2019s not being a positive person, it\u2019s absolutely okay to distance yourself.", "NTA. Seems like your friend missed the memo about celebrating your wedding.\n\nSounds like she\u2019s going through something and decided to vent it in the most inappropriate setting.

Your fiance will soon be family and will be building a life with him.", "Bro WTF? You are obviously NTA. Your wedding party and guests should support the marriage, not blatantly shit on it. Sorry this happened - I wonder if something in her life suddenly made her this jaded against relationships/marriage?", "NTA. Yes, there are a lot of relationships that don\u2019t work in the end, but if your friend is so miserable in life that she ignores the existence of tons of romantic relationships that continue long past the time when physical sex is a major factor, she is not worth wasting time of your life being around anyway.", "NTA \n\nIt's fine if marriage doesn't interest her personally, but it is not ok to air her views at your engagement party like that. Is she mad at you for being in a committed relationship?", "NTA. Based off her chosen character to quote it feels like she sees herself as enlightened. That she is ahead of everyone else because she \"knows\" love is not real. She is looking upon other people's lives with her own viewpoint and when the relationships don't make sense to her she assumes they the ones that are wrong. A very important thing to remember about Rick & Morty is that Rick is a deeply disturbed and broken man. Anytime you agree with Rick it warrants a look in the mirror to see if you aren't broken as well.", "I think this is a good example of the problems you get when people are told that authenticity is the only important virtue.

I am tempted with a little ESH, but you're fully in your right to not want someone at your wedding who is singing \"LOVE STINKS\".\n\nYou two need to have a conversation if you want to rekindle the friendship.

If she says no, she made her choice and you made the right one.", "Look her joke was dumb and it is your wedding so you can invite whoever you want. So NTA.\n\nBut is this really the hill you want to die on? Kicking someone out of a wedding is usually a relationship destroyer.\n\nSit her down over coffee or whatever and have an open conversation. Tell her how you feel and how you'd like an apology. Explain that you know she wasn't malicious but that it had felt that way. Tell her you only want supportive people at your wedding and you'd like for her to be there because you love her. \n\nAnd depending on how that convo goes, adjust.", "She said \u201cI hate to break it to you, but what people calls 'love' is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed.

A most fitting analogy I hope to use someday. \n\nThe friend reads like she's been burned in relationships or something, but that's not OP's problem. One of my best friends got engaged right after I got out of an abusive dumpster fire of a relationship. I was disillusioned and basically like a feral cat about men and relationships.  But instead of shitting all over her happiness, I congratulated her, helped her pick a ring for her husband, went to her bachelorette party, and was a good, supportive friend.

Especially if she had repeated the \u201cfocus on science\u201d part directly to you. But then she would have had to have followed up with some stories of how you and your fianc\u00e9 prove that quote is wrong, how much you do love each other and how amazing you are. \n\nSince she\u2019s obviously going through some things, she should have simply declined to give a speech at all. It sucks that she\u2019s angry that she can\u2019t find love, but taking it out on you was wrong.

Like folks shoving their religion in your face and telling you to 'accept the Lord! as your Savior' that is what she is doing to you and it is wrong. If you couch it in those terms and she still doesn't see she's the one being an AH, yeah, cut ties. NTA", "If the people getting married are into it then I agree, could be pretty funny. Not the case here though.", "I just looked up BHP and now I feel dumber.", "Alright, we\u2019ll call it a draw", "I was at a Catholic wedding ceremony where the priest choose Original Sin and the Fall of Man.
