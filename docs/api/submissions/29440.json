Because of this, mom and my wife would argue a lot especially after we go out to eat. My wife decided to stop going and expected me to do the same as support but I didn't think it was fair for me to let go of a basically faamily tradition if you will over some minor disagreement between her and mom.

I was stunned to see her there and she acted all shocked and made a scene and got into a huge argument with mom then went to her parents house.

My wife decided to stop going and expected me to do the same as support but I didn't think it was fair for me to let go of a basically faamily tradition if you will over some minor disagreement between her and mom. So what I did was tell my wife that I'd go for business meetings but in reality I go to have dinner with my family. \n\n\nLast week, me and my family were eating at one of the usual places and my wife showed up.

Such a hard decision.", "You are stuck between your mother, who is blatantly excluding your wife because she thinks she's beneath her, and your wife who has done nothing wrong. Yeah, tricky.", "Only because you're afraid to stand on your own.", "No you are not. You made a choice.", "No you\u2019re not, you married your wife. Grow a backbone and tell your parents to show some respect to your chosen family. You aren\u2019t obligated to go to dinner with them every week", " No you aren\u2019t. You aren\u2019t stuck at all.", "He said his MOM said she doesn\u2019t have manners. So it sounds like husband was oblivious to whatever the faux pas is. If she were swearing and eating with her hands his mom wouldn\u2019t have to point it out to him.", "OP literally can\u2019t even say what she\u2019s doing wrong. He said his mother won\u2019t say. So it\u2019s clearly nothing obvious like burping at the table all the time. Sounds like the mom just does not like her, and OP is apparently ok with how his mom is treating his wife.", "Mama's boy", "How\u2019d his wife know where they were? I\u2019d start wondering how much sabotage my mother had been doing, but then I\u2019m not an asshole like this guy", "Op said he doesn't know because his mommy won't tell him. So it's nothing that he can see she does at dinner its just his mom. I'm guessing because he married someone she didn't approve of.", "He\u2019s a spoiled brat.", "He shouldn\u2019t have to stop going bc his wife chose to stop going. He also shouldn\u2019t lie to his wife about it.", "The post.", "This! \u261d\ud83c\udffb", "She ordered the wrong wine at each course.", "Unfortunately after only six months there won't be any.", ">You have declined to help her with whatever unknown etiquette violation she has committed\n\nBecause it's unknown even to him. Meaning it probably doesn't exist", "He literally doesn't know, his mum won't tell him what his wife did wrong.", "It might be talking with a full mouth of chewing with the mouth open. Less egregious but very annoying as well.\n\nJust playing devil's advocate, there's a small chance OP isn't a gaping cloaca.", "I will agree on the \"She's just mad\" guess you are having, if she can't even give him a reason. \nAnd OP hasn't noticed anything when they have been out in the past.\nOr it's something so minor. It's not even important, but MIL is using It to fuel her hate. .\n\nEither way. MIL seems to be the problem. I agree.", "Ah. So in reality, the poor girl has done nothing wrong.", "What do you expect from someone who grew up wealthy?", "Ah, I mean, aren\u2019t most on this sub? \ud83e\udd23 either gender roles reversed or just flat out stories most of the posts on here. That being said, I still very much enjoy calling people assholes.", "That sucks I didn't realize that. Never been divorced. \n\nBut yeah this whole etiquette thing is bs. I went to a michellin star sushi resturant a few years ago where they serve omakase. Hundreds of dollars and a personal sushi chef describing the food. I had a bad reaction to the texture of a fish. I finished it but the chef literally offered me a napkin to spit it out as it's not for everyone.", "Right. It\u2019s probably just an excuse for his snobby mother to exclude her. Like it\u2019s the height of bad manners to be rude to others, even when they are being rude towards you.\n\nOP doesn\u2019t even think it\u2019s worth finding out what his wife did \u201cwrong.\u201d He\u2019s just like eh, I\u2019ll just lie to her.\n\nLike did she use the wrong fork? Forget to put her napkin on her lap? Get the waiter\u2019s attention wrong? Or take off her pants and shit on the table during the appetizer.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/RJdr2Wq9Y1\nHe doesn\u2019t even know what his wife is doing wrong\u2026.", "I think OP would notice that though. I don\u2019t think he deserves a devil\u2019s advocate.", "But wouldn\u2019t he be able to notice something like that himself? If it\u2019s his mother with the issue and she won\u2019t say what it is, it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s an obvious (or, let\u2019s be honest, real) faux pas.", "Well, I\u2019d counter that the OP who doesn\u2019t stand up for his wife or communicate with her openly and respectfully is the problem.  MILs gonna MIL.", "I think the only thing she did wrong was marry him."]}
