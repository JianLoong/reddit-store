He has is the youngest of 3 siblings (1 sister, 2 brothers) and I am the youngest in my family and have 1 older sister. \n\nRecently his sister brought up the topic that if her and her husband were to pass away, they would want my boyfriend to take guardianship of their child (and me, as we are getting married next year). They have a 2.5 year old and are expecting another (due date May). My boyfriend was open to the idea and brought it up to me to get my opinion. I said i wouldn\u2019t want that, and if he were to agree to it, this would jeopardize our relationship. \n\nI don\u2019t want to look after and be responsible for his sisters children. We live in a HCOL area, and we want children of our own, so if worst case scenario something did happen to his sister and BIL, I don\u2019t want to be responsible for 2 children and don\u2019t think we could even afford it. \n\nI\u2019m also not particularly close with his sister/BIL and confused why they would want my bf to have guardianship in this case, as their older brother is more equipped (married and has child of his own). Sisters husband also has 2 siblings which are married and have children of their own. Boyfriend is a middle school teacher (maybe that\u2019s why?) and is close with his sister but has no children or experience looking after children. He spends a lot of his free time playing PS5 and coaching highschool lacrosse. \n\nBoyfriend eventually agreed with me and told his sister that he wouldn\u2019t want guardianship, and maybe we can revisit this topic a few years down the line. Sister got mad and is blaming me for changing his mind and is now talking trash about me to the rest of the family and saying I\u2019m not considering her children\u2019s future (why should I - theyre not my children!) \n\nAITA for not wanting guardianship of her children if they were to pass away and convincing my boyfriend to not agree to it?\n\nEdit: To add, boyfriend and I didn\u2019t say no never. We said no _right now_ and are open to this topic  in the future. We can barely support ourselves right now and if worst case something were to happen tomorrow or even a year from now, we would not be able to support the children. \n\nEdit 2: \u201cConvinced\u201d was a poor choice of words. I asked boyfriend what he plans for us to do if they pass away next week, and he said \u201cthat wouldn\u2019t happen\u201d. Then we started talking about what would we do if it _did_ happen and he agreed that we are no where near equipped to raise children **right now.**\n \nEdit 3: I\u2019ve mentioned this in several comments - but they have no money. No assets. No life insurance. No savings - literally nothing. If we agreed to this and they were to pass away 4 weeks from now, we wouldn\u2019t have enough money to even buy diapers or formula. \n\nEdit 4: Thanks for all the logical (and some slightly silly) replies. Muting this post now since I\u2019ve gotten all the input needed.

Of course he was receptive in the moment, as the sentiment is that most people would be. But when you think about the practicality of it all, reality hits and you realize it might not be the best fit. For you, *or* the kids.\n\nIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re just saying \u201cF*ck the kids, leave them homeless.\u201d You\u2019re confused why you would be the first option when there is another, comparatively more capable option available. You two aren\u2019t even married yet, and springing this on you is jarring.\n\nThis is a hypothetical, yes, but a hypothetical that could have real life-altering consequences should you agree without forethought and, if the worst happens, you are left with kids in your care that you aren\u2019t equipped to care for. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for just considering what such a thing would actually mean for you, your fianc\u00e9, and those kids. That\u2019s more forethought than many parents bother to give before they start having kids, tbh. I think it\u2019s very responsible.", "NTA. They asked your boyfriend because he has no child. So they know it\u2019s a financial big support to have two, and all others have children. Maybe they already answered \u00ab\u00a0no\u00a0\u00bb. You are right : what would happen financially if they die next week ? Could you afford one child ? If they die next year, could you take care of two ? \nWhen we think about the right person to take care of our children, it\u2019s if we die TOMORROW. Not in 5 years. You\u2019re not married, it\u2019s really an important decision and\u2026 I think it\u2019s bad to ask you before your wedding to decide for such a responsability.", "NTA. The crux of it is - it's unaffordable and probably will be for a while. If sister has burned bridges with other relatives because she insists on shit talking anyone who doesn't give her what she wants then that's her problem.\n\nAnother commenter said they agreed to it if the parent took out life insurance, that's a good idea for the future if you all agree to that.", "NTA\n\nMy husband was asked to be a godparent by his sister. He declined. We're childfree and intend to keep it that way, and there are people that would do a better job of raising kids if it came down to that. \n\nThe fact is, it doesn't matter how likely or unlikely it may be that you *would* end up having to take them in, it is still an obligation that would change your life if the worst happens and one you both NEED to be on board with. Absolutely nobody gets to demand it from you.", "NTA\n\nAs you're building a life, planning on getting married with your boyfriend, you 100% get equal say of if your boyfriend (and obviously you) should take his nieces/nephews in. And you're not willing to take on that responsibility. That's completely your right. There's no way your boyfriend can take in these children and have a relationship with you, if you don't agree to be their guardian as well. \n\nThe fact that your boyfriend's sister didn't invite you to these discussions and is now badmouthing you is an indication that she doesn't have any idea of your and your boyfriend's family dynamics and is just not counting you as his family at all.", "NTA. I told my husband before we got married (we are childfree) that if any of his siblings with multiple kids tries to approach us with guardianship of their kids if something happens, it has to be a no. He agreed. It's something that needs to be discussed as it is absolutely possible.", "Planning to get engaged in summer and married next year? Am I the only one who is like \u2018huh\u2019 do people do this? Plan on getting engaged?", "NTA, but keep in mind the parents' assets are typically put in a trust for the children which the guardian can use to provide for said children, so the fact that you personally can't afford to raise their children shouldn't be the driving issue. If that's really the main thing, you should have asked them for more information on what they intend to do with their assets in their will vis-a-vis the kids and their future.\n\nOf course if the issue is that you don't want children period, that's important too.", "What is the outcome of this argument.  Is she trying to convince you to care for her kids?  Like if you turned around and said, yeah you know what\u2026for sure leave them with me.  I\u2019ll definitely take care of them for you\u2019, does she think that\u2019s a good or safe idea?\n\nI have kids and I absolutely only want them with people who want to have them.  I don\u2019t want them with people who are cajoled into taking them\u2026kids feel that.  That\u2019s not the life I want for my kids after the trauma of losing both their parents.\n\nThis is just not smart.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If you\u2019re barely supporting yourselves it would be madness to throw a couple of very young children into the mix.

You\u2019re thinking practically.", "This is why you ask the person before you draw up the paper work. And not surprise them later on or demand it.\n\nThey may not be willing or able to take your kids for whatever reason.\n\nThe fact is if op is going to have a future with the bf then she gets to have an option. \n\nThis is not something you agree to so you make someone happy or to keep peace in the family. If you do this and do it right this is a big commitment. It\u2019s a commitment you should look as if this going to happen tomorrow how do we do this. You don\u2019t wait until something unfortunate happens take the kids in and go oh hell I didn\u2019t think this through.\n\nOp and the bf was open and honest with the sister. They may be her choice but op and bf are not comfortable with the situation. So the sister needs to accept the no and find someone else that is willing and capable. She may be upset and that\u2019s ok but she needs to understand that sometimes what you want doesn\u2019t always happen. So instead of bashing/guilting/ manipulating the family to hate op she needs to find a plan b.", "Nta \n\nIf your answer isn't a *wholehearted* \"Yes\" to taking in additional children, then the answer should be no. It would be better for the children to be placed in a household that will prioritize them and actually wants them to be there.", "just my  $0.02  but I do not get going to someone and asking them to take care of your child in case of your death and not having some sort of life insurance policy in place to defray some of the costs. especially at first. I mean, I get it, it's family, and what isn't your business isn't your business- but at the point that they ask this- it's certainly fair game to ask- have you taken steps to provide for them in the even that something DOES happen to you? I'd be willing to say- I'm not unwilling to care for your children- but I am unwilling to do it at the point that it means that I cannot afford to have my own. I'm going to need to you to take out a life insurance policy to cover your children's basic care before I agree.", "Do they have life insurance? Between that and survivor's benefits (depending where you are) you could actually be financially very set to look after those children if that were to be the issue.\n\nI find it odd you say that you want your own children and that's a reason not to do it, but also describe already having their own children as a reason she *should* have gone for other siblings.", "NTA. your reasons are totaly understandable. Is not easy to raise kids and you should be 100% certain before embraicing such responsability.", "NTA.    \n\nTaking on guardianship of children is a huge responsibility and should not be taken on lightly.     \n\nReally, they are mild ah because they should have discussed it with both of you present. Plus they should have details in place - will there be a trust set up for the children? What about paying for college? Do they expect the children to be part of a religious community?     \n\nYou mention that you're in a hcol area - where do they expect their children to be raised? Would they want you to move from where you are now?     \n\nI suspect your bf framed your refusal as \"she said no.\" It's more like \"we can't say yes now because we haven't made decisions about our future, and we need more information before we decide if we can take on such a huge responsibility.\"", "You discussed it and told him your feelings and the reality that you may end the relationship if he agrees to it. That's exactly what you're supposed to do - state your boundaries and the potential consequences. \n\nHe had the option to agree or disagree with you and to decide if this was a deal breaker for him. \n\nI don't see the conflict though. He agreed with you as you both talked it out and it doesn't appear that his sister is mad at him or you. So who is calling you an AH? \n\nNTA", "Could the sister and her husband buy life insurance policies that you have access to view/confirm? If so, that could help ease the financial burden on both of you and set their kids up for a better future. The life insurance money can go into a trust where you and your BF are the executors of the trust and her kids can have access to it after x years or by completing certain things (graduate college, marriage, kids of their own, etc).\n\nThis way, their kids would be taken care of. If they balk, then they fully expect you to be their insurance. \n\nNTA", "You stated you are confused as to why your boyfriend\u2019s sister asking him to be a guardian when he doesn\u2019t have experience taking care of kids and spends a lot of free time playing PS5 and coaching lacrosses. \n\nThen why do YOU want to have kids with him? lol\n\nAnyway, you\u2019re NTA. It\u2019s great that you are insightful and willing to acknowledge the potential hardships that could come of this. You deserve to build your life together as you want. Plus, you are willing to have this conversation at a later date and possibly reconsider.", "NTA - this is definitely a 2 yes one no situation.\nYou gave your partner your honest feelings on it and he acted on that.\n\nHis sister is over reacting. Nobody is owed things like guardianship.", "NTA. If you don't want to raise someone else's children, they shouldn't try to make you feel guilty or talk trash about you. After that, good for you for saying no.\n\nIt is super unlikely that would ever happen, but I know someone who is now raising their young niece due to her parents getting killed in a car accident. It does happen.", "NTA parents/guardians who emphatically do not want to be parents/guardians are worse than no parents/guardians", "Nta: this is a huge choice and it needs to be two yeses or it's a no. Having or taking on children is a huge responsibility. Feeling or knowing it isn't for you, even just for the moment, and sticking to that is the responsible choice", "If they ever do get you to agree, make sure they get life insurance and that they pay the premium every month!  You are not the AH", "NTA.\n\nCircumstances change. When I was born, my fathers brother and his wife were my god-parents. If anything happened to them, they'd be the ones I would be living with. Then when I was about 15 or so, they talked to my parents and said that if something happened *now*, it wouldn't work out for the guardianship. They lived an hour away, they were now empty nesters -my cousins having left home and my ailing grandmother moved into a nursing home. I would have to move for my final year of schooling - which wouldn't have been fair to me or them.\n\nThere was a discussion and ait was changed so that if something happened to me, it would be my mothers best friend who would look out for me. She lived in the same town as I did, she had a son who was my age (we're about a week apart). I'd either live in my house and she'd come help me with things (groceries, bill management, etc.), or I could move into her house and she'd help manage the renting of my house. I could stay with my friends for my final year of school. It was a change that made sense for everyone involved.\n\nYour SIL is allowed to be upset. That doesn't give her the right to be abusive.", "NTA.  I respect you for actually considering the ramifications if something were to happen in the near future and realizing it's not possible right now, but might be in the future. Too many people say yes without considering anything. Her attitude and badmouthing would make it a never.", "NTA but potential boyfriend red flag. He should have said: 1. This is something we need to discuss with OP present. Now that mistake can be forgiven. But it sounds like he said, \u201cyeah I\u2019d be honored.\u201d And assumed you\u2019d be too. Once you hit him with logic, he was like, \u201cUh dang, good point.\u201d It was then up to him to make sure he cleared it up with his sister. Did he \u201cthrow you under the bus?\u201d If so, major red flag\u2026\n\n(Edit) also HUGE SIL red flag. No offense, but you two aren\u2019t even engaged yet. Extremely irresponsible to thrust that decision on her brother and not even engaged girlfriend.", "NTA. And it doesn\u2019t sound quite like you \u201cconvinced\u201d him, but rather made him think about it in a realistic way\u2026? It\u2019s easy to automatically say yes to something for someone bc you want them to know you\u2019re there for them, but when faced with something this serious, this *important*, it\u2019s best to give it some serious thought. \n\nBeing honest and saying you are ill-equipped is beneficial for everyone involved, *especially* the kids", "NTA\n\nThis is something that should be agreed upon. You don't agree with it, and he can't make a decision for both of you. If it's a deal breaker for him, then he should end the romance with you before marriage.", "NTA people in this thread saying the chances are slim that your bf would actually take guardianship are being naive. Slim DOES NOT mean zero. Freak accidents and illnesses can happen suddenly and do all the time. \n\nOP gets a say because of course they do if they\u2019re expecting to be in this relationship long term. And the fact that the sister wants to get paperwork drawn up would mean they get locked into a guardianship possibility.", "NTA. I\u2019ve seen the comments you made and with your post I don\u2019t see how anyone could say either of you are. His knee jerk reaction is to say yes because he loves his sister and her kids. All you did was list the reasons why taking in the kids in the near future(let\u2019s say the next 5- 10 years) wouldn\u2019t be the most ideal situation for anyone. \n\nHer and her husband have other family members(like their parents and other siblings) that they can ask. If the worst does happen and it\u2019s not explicitly dictated in their will then child services would do the asking anyways.", "NTA because you had a discussion and made the joint decision that you are not the correct choice, at least not right now.", "Im going to say NTA. \nI don't get how people can get mad when someone says no to that. Id rather hear an honest no than a yes that was a lie because they felt obligated to.", "NTA-Even if it doesn\u2019t happen in the future, never agree to something you really don\u2019t want to do.", "NTA.\n\nWhy on earth would you be? They're not your children. It's okay to ask, everyone should try to have a plan in place, but it's a huge ask and a huge burden.\n\nI think his sister is the asshole for not taking her brother's refusal with grace.", "NTA-You looked at the present time and realized if they were to die tomorrow that you are not equipped to make it work.  Makes sense.  The sister obviously did not take this into account of whomever told her didn't explain it properly.  She is probably mad because she may have asked the others and they diverted to your BF because you both do not have children.  I wouldn't be surprised if he wasn't the first choice and is getting mad at everyone deflecting.  Kids have become overly expensive and in this economy something will have to give.", "NTA - After the edits clarified a bit more, I feel like they have plenty of other options. He's allowed to change his mind after a meaningful conversation with his **future wife. Who didn't have a say in future SIL getting or being pregnant.** So, saying you're not financially ready, or even not ready in general, should be more of a blessing to them. Because they should want to know their kids are with someone who can afford to care for them. Not just love them because they are family, but be able to justifiably take that big of a responsibility on.", "NTA and this is something that should be discussed between the two of you. I also wonder how much her burnt bridges with other family members plays a factor in all this. If he\u2019s on the same page as you currently, then let him deal with her and her shit taking. That\u2019s his responsibility not yours.", "NTA. \n\nThat\u2019s a big ask for anyone, financially and mentally stable or not. \n\nIt\u2019s a lifelong commitment - you cannot expect anyone to just be on board with that decision and I would be concerned if someone agreed to it lightly. Why they would opt for someone with no kids and likely limited experience versus someone who has been down that road before is beyond me.", "NTA because of the effect on your own relationship. Since you're getting married next year they needed to ask both of you not just him. Since you're not on board with it they need to back off.\n\nIt's weird they'd ask him between your engagement and wedding Since this sort of thing can end relationships. Don't they like you?", "It's a huge hypothetical, but they are wise to get it figured out. Whomever ends up taking the role needs to make sure the parents have a will, a super-healthy life insurance policy for the children's care and education, and they'd also be eligible for their parents' social security. So in terms of the financial responsibility, it should be taken care of, especially if it's part of any any plan put together for possible guardianship. If you feel like having a conversation with his sister, as opposed to a fight, have your BF let them know you are happy to revisit in a few years, with the understanding that certain provisions would be in place to help offset the cost of raising newly-orphaned children. (It falls into the \"how does this work\" category - there are tons of legalities to address.)", "NTA \"Not right now\" is a reasonable answer. Sure, she feels as if you're rejecting her children but her feelings are not the truth. Hopefully, she will see reason in a few days.", "2 is exactly how to look at this...it does happen often unfortunately for all sorts of reasons.Very smart of you both not to treat this casually...cause it never happens!", "NTA, but I think it matters how sister and husband set this up.  For example, if both mom and dad died, those kids would need a ton of TLC.  This means intense therapy, and likely, one of you would need to quit your job.  \n\nIf sister and husband had robust life insurance policies that went into a trust for raising those kids, that is fine.  It should pay you something like 2000 amounts to raise those kids (food, larger home, larger cars and loss of income). Medical should also be paid by this estate, and the bills sent directly to the whomever that is (this trust should be handled by a non family member and paid too... usually, a law firm does this as they can protect the money best).\n\nIf sister and husband just want to give you kids and no money, then don't do this.", "NTA - it's not just the money issue, it's also the issue of whether you can help children after trauma and raise children with trauma. It costs time, money, energy and much more to raise a child. It becomes even more difficult if the child has been through something difficult. You most like would have to move and re-plan your entire future.\nAlso none of you know yet whether the other child will be healthy or not. \nIt's such a heavy question to just throw out and hope for a yes.", "No, NTA. You should never agree to a guardianship role for children (or to be a parent for that matter) unless you are ready to take it on immediately. That means being financially, physically and emotionally ready for the responsibility.", "NTA - Although I do think y\u2019all should all sit down together and have an adult, honest conversation about the situation and your feelings (because they are valid). If they don\u2019t want to hear you or be grown ups about it then that\u2019s on them, dude.", "NTA/NAH and smart of you for prioritizing the fact that you\u2019re not in a good position to raise a child, even if the chances of it happening are slim. The chances are *still there*. BF probably didn\u2019t realize there\u2019s a lot more to consider and once you laid it out, changed his perspective.", "NTA. You stated your position. He was free to part ways and take up his sisters offer. I don't understand why people are saying that you're manipulative. That's a huge responsibility that should not be agreed to for lolz.", "NTA. I am honestly shocked at all these Y T A judgements, saying this was purely hypothetical, when in an story concerning a partner/spouse potentially on the live for taking care of a high needs sibling people jump in to say how important it is for thechild's parents to have a confirmed plan what happens with that child when they die. This was the mother trying to confirm her plan, right here. No matter the reasonings, taking in children 100% should be a two yes one no situation - if OP knows she wouldn't want to, it was fair of her to tell her partner that if he would commit to taking them in, she would split with him. 'Ultimatum' became an ugly word on reddit, but some situations very much are a place for an ultimatum, and your partner making a life decision that you know would lead to you not wanting to be with them is one of such places - why waste anyone's time and pretend to try for a compromise when there's no compromise to be had?", "Wtf NTA there's like half a dozen more qualified financially secure people who could take the little critters.", "YTA. Not necessarily for saying no, your financial concerns are valid. But your whole attitude makes you one. They are your bf niblings and you literally said you don\u2019t care about their future. Thats not a good look. And you say one of the reasons you don\u2019t want to is because you would struggle to raise your own kids (which you don\u2019t have yet) and in the next sentence say how the other uncles would be better suited because they have children of their own\u2026 like what?", "Nta people need to not give guardianship to child free people over people with kids.

I expected to see either an account with money for that child or a term life insurance. Kids aren't cheap", "NTA, if you\u2019re not allowed to say no; you aren\u2019t being asked a question.", "I'm going with INFO because I think it depends on your boyfriend's true feelings on whether he would want to be their guardian.  If he would and you are trying to convince him otherwise then I would say you're poisoning the waters by trying to talk him out of it, and doing him and the kids a great disservice.  I do think that it's admirable that you are honest with him about your true feelings on the subject though, as saying \"yes\" and then treating the children resentfully would be far worse than just telling him honestly flat out that you don't agree with it.\n\nThat being said, I have a 5 year old daughter, and I have spoken with my 23 year old stepson several times about wanting him to be her guardian should anything ever happen to me and his dad.  Granted he's young but he knows her better than anyone, would raise her the closest to how myself and her dad do, and I trust him with her life.  I asked him what he would do if his future wife felt the way you do, and he said \"If someone felt that way about my sister I wouldn't want to marry them.\"  I think having an honest discussion with your boyfriend would be best, keeping in mind that if that tragic incident did occur and you truly love your man, you would want what's best for him and his family, regardless of what that is.", "NTA, I\u2019m going to incur Redits rage.

Is she expecting you to raise her kids on your dime? \n\nBefore she takes the easy way out and dump her kids on the one who she hasn't burned the bridge with, she needs to make provisions to have someone else take care of them.", "YTA\n\nNot for not wanting to take them, that is your choice.\n\nNot for setting a clear boundary.\n\nYTA for planning on marrying/starting a family with a guy whose family you have no interest in/care for/compassion for.\n\nHis sister and her husband decided that of all possible options they thought your BF was the best choice and you want to stop their wish.

If sister doesn't really have anything in place, then I totally get it. \n\nWe asked my BIL who is single with no kids. My sister has 4 kids and his sister is single with 2 kids. My son has sensory issues and would be miserable with either of our sister's long term, but would deal and gets along great with his cousins if it was the only option. Our son also has the most in common with his uncle.  My husband (40) and I (37) have significant savings in place. Our house is paid off, we have life insurance, significant regular/emergency savings, college savings, etc. All would go to BIL for care of our kiddo (MIL and SIL and my sister would also be fully involved to give him relief, etc as well). \n\nI would have understood if he said no, and we have backup plans if he changes his mind, or something happens to BIL that makes it no longer feasible (illness, accident whatev). Our sisters with multiple kids are also much more financially strained than BIL is to start out with. Idk, I just feel like asking the OP & bf that don't have kids isn't automatically a bad option- I don't feel there is enough info.", "This isn\u2019t all that uncommon of a tactic, sadly.

Yes he has no kids, but he is a great uncle. \n\nOur house is paid off, we have decent savings (for us and for kiddos college), retirement savings, and life insurance. All of it would go to BIL for kiddos care. My MIL, FIL and both our siblings are amazing and none of them would just leave my BIL to raise my kiddo alone either. They would all be helping with whatever they can, too.\n\nI'm curious if OP and bf even asked what kind of financial savings are in place if the worst case scenerio happened?

TBH, if I have to die before my kids are grown, I'd prefer for them to be raised by someone who I feel close to, and who has some connection to me. \n\nObviously, this doesn't make OP the AH here, and the sister's response is not appropriate.

They asked for an almost immediate answer, boyfriend says he thinks it\u2019s because they wanted some paperwork drawn up. We don\u2019t want to agree to it **right now** and said we would be open to discussing it in the future.", "I answered the question. My sister would never put me and bf down as first option for guardianship because we have no experience, resources, or money to raise a child.", "I think you should add this into the op!", "It's completely fair and understandable that you wouldn't want to take in the kids then. I was just saying that there at least needs to be a real conversation about it. Like others have mentioned, make that life insurance policy a prerequisite for the guardianship when you do decide to revisit the topic", "Yea especially since op said many times there are other siblings that are much better choice. If anything if the bf and op say yes they are the ah, the other older siblings that are married with houses are much better choices.", "I have added that now! :)", "Yes, when we asked someone to be guardians we also shared the financial situation and what resources my children would have.", ">Only, in this case, the empty basket is not a basket at all, and is in fact a shredder and not fit to carry your laundry in the slightest.\n\nHAHA, that is too funny", "I mean yeah but technically in that case there is concern for anything. If the future guardian does drugs, ends up in prison, abuse kids, etc. Never know.\n\nIdk i don't think I'd be able to make the decision alone. I'd definitely have to talk it out with all the family members.", "This is what I mean. What\u2019s the point the proposal is the agreement to get married/the engagement. What are they going to do, go to Disney world and he gets on one knee and she\u2019s like \u2018YES!\u2019 And then takes a pic for Instagram?", "Well clearly OP doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s stupid and that\u2019s fully the only thing that matters on that topic\u2026", "What lies is she telling? You didn't mention any in your post. And why does it even matter, since you say everyone is on your side?", "Dude you can\u2019t make a post looking for judgement and then be mad that people are making judgements based on the information given because they \u201cdon\u2019t even know about you or the family dynamics\u201d. What\u2019s the point of making this post just to say that you don\u2019t really care what peoples opinions are lmao", "Are you lost? You're literally on a public internet forum asking a large group of strangers what they think of you.\n\nThere are a million places you can say \"I don't really care what a stranger on the internet thinks of me.\" This is one of the **very few** places where saying that is actually laughably hilarious.", ">I don\u2019t really care what a stranger on the internet thinks of me \n\nYou kind of do since you posted \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Never said otherwise.", "They are young and it should be super cheap for a 20 year 1MM dollar policy (less than 50 a month). \n\n\nHonestly, if you have kids you each should have term life insurance that replaces your contributions while kids are in the house. \n\nA stay at home parent will need to be replaced by babysitters and cleaners.  A working parent will need to have their salary and household contributions replaced.\n\nThe death of a partner is horrible. Leaving the remaining parent to\nStruggle (or guardians) is even worse.", "Not even life insurance through work?\n\nWhat about government benefits? In the USA, children can receive social security benefits for deceased parents, in Canada children can receive Canada pension plan survival benefits\u2026benefits can be received by each child, for each parent.", "[deleted]", "True true.. there's a lot of what ifs in the future. In my siblings' will several people are listed as potential guardians. It's a list where people get a ranking and the first person listed gets first right of refusal for the children and if they say no the next person is asked. This is partly because yes they may forget to update the will but taking in the kids will involve certain conditions which they may or not meet when the time comes.", "What if that IS what they\u2019re going to do? And it makes them happy? Is anything else relevant? Like it doesn\u2019t matter what your preference is, it\u2019s not your relationship lol", "Obviously because being trash talked and insulted is still hurtful/annoying. Not to mention it causes drama that no one wants or cares about. Even if everyone is on OPs side, lies and BS are still hurtful/annoying.", "But people ARENT making judgements based on the info given. They are randomly assuming things and making shit up, and basing their judgement on THAT. So yea, OP can be mad that people are just randomly making shit up and insulting her over it.", "I hope you\u2019re having a good laugh!", "\u201cThinks of me personally.\u201d \n\nYou could think I\u2019m an AH in this situation and that\u2019s cool.

We would be happy to revisit the topic in the future.", "I\u2019ll play what if with you. Even if she would agree to her sister right now saying no to his still would not make her the asshole.\n\nFor the simple fact they may have a very different relationship with the kids.\n\nHer sister may have been more financially stable.\n\nAnd if the cases were 100 percent the same.\n\nHer bfs sister had this conversation (about their future) without op.  This tells me she doesn\u2019t view op as family. And then when they tell her no she bashes them. \n\nSo why do you take on kids of someone you\u2019re not close to. It\u2019s a forever lifetime commitment that will change your life.", "People are so keen for an argument they are missing the point. Google the definition of proposal. In their relationship that\u2019s already happened was my point. Good on them for longing it out and doing the most. Like girls and a birthday month", "Oh, I see from comments you are in BC. The CPP child benefit if $291/month, per child, per deceased parent (provided parent meets some standards of contribution). So it wouldn\u2019t enable guardians to buy a bigger home, but would cover formula and diapers.", "It\u2019s just a pretty weird thing to take issue with but you do you, man"]}
