{"id": 33384, "submission_id": "18maswx", "title": "WIBTA for cancelling Christmas with my family because of my dog?", "selftext": "I (26F) just got a call from my mom with a request to change our Xmas plans from a location 2.5 hours away from all of us to their house: which is potentially more than 6 hours away for me and my husband with holiday traffic. This request is to accommodate my younger brother (24M) who has been dealing with chronic back pain for over a year, and does not think he can do the drive. Probably important context: my husband (29M) and I both think that my younger brother is coddled by my parents, and feel a bit frustrated because part of his prolonged back issues seem to be tied to him not doing his PT / making the required lifestyle changes. Regardless, we have made 8+ hour drives home for Christmas before, so the change is annoying but reasonable. Plus: we like my family, and wanted to spend the holidays together.  \n\nThe issue is that we now have an 11 month old puppy who does not do well in the car. If he\u2019s not let out every hour, he throws up and is just clearly miserable the whole time. We have anti-anxiety medication specifically prescribed to help him in the car, but my husband is still uncomfortable about putting him through such misery for 6+ hours. When we first chatted about it, my stance was \u201cyes, it sucks but we can\u2019t just not see family just because our pup doesn\u2019t like the car. We\u2019ll stop a lot on the way and give him his medicine.\u201c My husband said ok, but he was clearly not 100% on board, so I suggested we talk more later. Now I\u2019m reflecting and thinking he may be right - and a 6+ hour trip is too much for our new dog, and maybe I\u2019m being too accommodating to my family. And no one is available to watch him over the holidays on such short notice, so that\u2019s not an option.  \n\nI have to tell my folks something soon, because the plan was to leave on Thursday - so WIBTA if I refused their request and effectively \u201ccanceled Christmas\u201d?", "created_utc": 1703015620, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18maswx/wibta_for_cancelling_christmas_with_my_family/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
