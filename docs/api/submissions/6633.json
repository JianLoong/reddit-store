Our lease is up for renewal and rent is going up. Meanwhile, a house my parents own, which they inherited from my grandfather, has just become vacant. My younger sister and her boyfriend lived there until recently, paying rent to my parents at below market rates. The \u201cfamily rate\u201d also includes my parents doing the gardening and lawn mowing.\n\nNow, my parents want my bf and I to move in. When they put it to us initially, they asked for ~10% more in rent than my sister and her bf were paying. It\u2019s a cheaper option compared to staying where we are, but I thought it was unfair to be asked to pay more than my sister. There\u2019s no mortgage (same for their other house) and costs for running the house haven\u2019t increased.\n\nWe made a counter-offer: instead of paying rent, we\u2019d take over all running costs and responsibilities, and also pay for renovations to the house (which it desperately needs), i.e. we\u2019d donate time/effort to improving the house in exchange for lower \u201crent\u201d. After discussion, my parents seemed to like this idea.\n\nMy bf and I gave notice to our landlord that we\u2019d move out at the end of our lease. We wrote my parents a proposal for an annual sum of ~80% of what my sister and her bf paid, but including all things a landlord would usually pay for (e.g. rates, utilities supply, insurance), responsibility for maintenance, plus the agreed-upon renovations.\n\nMy parents have said our offer isn\u2019t enough. They\u2019re now asking us to pay the 10% more per week they originally asked for, INCLUDING all the responsibilities/renovations we offered to take on. They\u2019ve said we should be happy to be paying less than market rates and saving money compared to if we renewed our current lease. This is fine but we\u2019re quite happy where we are and my parents\u2019 house, while cheaper, is in nowhere near as nice an area and is going to cost us in other ways e.g. moving costs.\n\nI\u2019m confused and unhappy, first because I was asked to pay more than my sister for the same house, and second because I feel my counter-offer has been turned against me and I\u2019m now going to be expected to have all this extra responsibility and live in a construction site while also paying more than my sister. I also can\u2019t back out and stay in my current place as we already gave notice to leave.\n\nIt was probably a mistake not to have settled terms fully with my parents before giving notice to move out, but I didn\u2019t expect them not to see our offer as a win-win.\n\nAITA?

I'm sure he's not in the mood to get new tenants. It's quite the hassle.\n\nAs for your parents, AH for asking you do the work plus rent and turning back on shaked hands. It's not about the 10% increase, that's their business and are not obliged to give equal treatment. Probably the price they rent for is really small. But really I can't imagine my parents asking my bro rent for the apartment he stays in with his gf. Sorry but it's mind boggling.

Is there any way you can talk to your current landlord and try to extend renew your lease? Because your parents are kind of screwing you over. So even if you end up taking up their deal due to necessity I hope you get to move out soon after.", "NTA. Are you able to retract your notice to your landlord?

I\u2019m happy to accept that it\u2019s not helpful to be annoyed about the 10% increase I was originally asked to pay, however most people agree we are being screwed if we\u2019re expected to do the renovations and run the house on top of that. Unfortunately, I think we will still have to move out of our current place. I\u2019m going to suggest to my parents that we either pay the amount they want for us to be normal tenants, minus the renovations, or we agree on a lower amount. And if neither of those options sound good to them, we will find somewhere else to rent, most likely interstate (where they will probably only see me once a year).", "Yes, definitely should not have submitted that paperwork until things were final but oh man - they screwed you. I wouldn't have assumed my parents would change their mind after agreeing like that, and then waiting until after things were finalized with your current landlord to revoke the deal and make a newer, and very crappy offer. Easy mistake to make!\n\nI also wouldn't compare to your sister, the whole fair/unfair thing because of siblings is a poor argument, and it would save money regardless. What is the most unfair is that they now expect all the additional things you only offered in exhange for no or cheaper rent. That is unfair, especially doing so when you have closed one door already.", "NTA\n\n> It was probably a mistake not to have settled terms fully with my parents before giving notice to move out\n\nCorrect.  \nCould you cancel the cancelling of the lease? and then use that to encourage your parents to return to the original agreement?", "NTA\n\nDon't move into their house.  By not moving in, you would save yourself a lot of problems.

They've changed the deal. I guess you could pay the rent they're asking, but charge them for the renovations. Materials plus an hourly rate. Prices have increased lately so paying more than your sister is reasonable. But if they want renovations on top of that - it's fair they pay for it.", "NTA - It's one of two things, either your parents are having financial trouble, and they really need the money and are too proud to admit it, or they are unfathomably awful human beings.  Either way, moving forward with your parents on this, in any fashion, will not go well for you, or your relationship with them.  Either try to work with your current landlord, or get to apartment shopping.  Eventually, once the renovations are finished, they'll ask you to move out, and sell the property, and then where will you be, both financially, and in your relationship with them?  Family and money often don't mix.", "Your parents are happy to be greedy and try get more money out of you and renovations etc! \nI'd tell them to stick it and find somewhere else to rent. \nYou don't want to be dealing with their greedyness for the next few years", "\"Sorry mum and dad.

I hope you find someone soon\"\n\nIf they were happy with +10% or with you paying renovation costs and utilities, it's difficult to see how they feel that +10% AND utilities etc is just as fair.\n\nDon't do it.

I would say it\u2019s not great your parent change their agreement with you just after your gave the notice to your landlord.\n\nWhat I would say : don\u2019t try to compare with your sister, if the rent is lower at least of what you got before it\u2019s still okay (I know it\u2019s unfair but you will be unhappy for something that you can let go and it\u2019s not so serious) but at this moment you don\u2019t do all the extra thing you planned to do in you original propose.

You won\u2019t be doing both. They are being greedy.", "NTA. It's only the beginning of the month. Just ask your landlord if you can stay. If that's impossible, can you find another apartment in your area? Or anywhere else? Doesn't sound like a great idea to become involved with your parents for a roof over your head if they screw you over like that. \n\nTell your parents you rather stay in the area you are living now, so you won't become their tenant. Then just keep repeating and say nothing else. If they tell you they are disappointed, you are wrong, etc, just tell them \"I'm sorry to hear that, but we won't change our decision.\" this way, you don't make more drama than necessary. In the bad case family members chime in, tell them the same.\n\nYou can also opt in to tell them you don't appreciate the way they are handling this, but count on losing a part of the relationship. If you are willing to do so, I totally understand, as they really are pulling the rug from under you.

Treat it like any other business relationship.  Don\u2019t get emotional.  If they won\u2019t budge, then find a property that works better for you.\n\nExplore rent to own options with parents.

You're right, the terms should have been agreed before you made any definite decisions but it's bad of your parents to go back on their offer.

As you've realized, it would've been wise to get the contract finalized before cancelling your lease, but you naturally trusted your parents.
