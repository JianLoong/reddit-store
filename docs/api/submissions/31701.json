It has always bothered me when we were kids and we had awful fights because of it. Recently, he's doing the same thing with the house, he always refers to the house as his and tells everyone that he's the one who bought the house, when it was clearly me. It doesn't bother me that much because we don't really have any friends in common because of our age difference.\n\nNow comes the problem. He kept in contact with his ex because he has a really good relationship with her kid, but because of that, they were starting to get close again and she regrets breaking up with him. He tells me he doesn't want to get back together with her but I know him well enough to realize he's still in love with her. \n\nOne night I came home from work and my brother told me that his ex was going to come to the house because she was upset and had a fight with her mother. I told him that she coud come, but I didn't want her spending the night. He got upset with me and started questioning the reasons why. I explained him that I knew that he was still into her and that they eventually would get back together, and I if that happened, I knew he would want her to come live in my house with her kid and I didn't want that to happen. \n\nHe told me I was overreacting and got upset with me. She eventually had to spend the night because there was a storm and she couldn't go back home. The next day I told my brother that that was going to be the last time she spends the night at the house and he got mad at me again. He told me that he was living there too and he had the right to bring home whoever he wanted.\n\nAITA?\n\n*Note: He's not helping me pay for the bills or food because he's been having a bad couple of months at his work, but he does most of the chores around the house since I'm working and studying at the same time.", "created_utc": 1700921502, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183kkx2/aita_for_not_letting_my_brothers_exgirlfriend_to/", "score": 311, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He should really kick him out or get a signed agreement for when his brother will be out the house so he doesnt end up getting squatters rights or treated as a tenant", "Give him 30 day eviction notice . If you don\u2019t be prepared to have an entire family living in your home rent free, and no one to blame but yourself", "Kick her out right now. Tell her if she isn't gone within an hour, you will call the police to have her removed and charge her with trespass. And tell your brother the same. Then change the locks because your brother has a key and probably made one for his girlfriend.", "I know. I have two older brothers , and I am older than my two younger sisters. My brothers never made a habit of taking control of my stuff, except to pick on me as little kids maybe. Like to take a toy and play keepaway until our parents told them to stop. Ha!  I never did it to my younger ones either. It sucks that she sees this as normal sibling behavior because it isn't.", "Ahahah I was thinking the same \ud83d\ude02 as far as I know, my experience, (and friends experience)  it is younger sibling that acts that way", "for me it was cousins. but yeah, older siblings/relatives tend to get more control. i never got to pick what game we played, and when they got bored of me being around, they\u2019d just shoo me away. in all honesty, it made me stop talking to a majority of them and would be alone/with a friend during any family event", "It doesn't even require that someone be older.  This kind of situation requires three ingredients:\n\n1)  A family member with a strong personality who learns they can steamroll other members of the family; \n\n2)  A family member with a weaker personality or a \"go along to get along\" view who allows themselves to be steamrolled; and,\n\n3)  Adults and other family members who could put a stop to the behavior, but either ignore it or validate it.  \n\nGive it a couple decades, and a pattern forms.", "I'm also the oldest and I never do this crap. The only time I could have been described as controlling over my brothers' things was when I used to steal one of my younger brother's sweatshirts (he's almost a foot taller so they were very comfortable and I always did it discreetly and never right in his face). \n\ni", "This is good advice, generally.  If he does not cooperate, OP will have to escalate to an eviction notice.  My only caution is that OP needs to follow the law to the letter.  There are plenty of jurisdictions where, in this situation, OP's brother would be considered a bona fide tenant and would this be entitled to notice, etc.  etc.  \n\nPeople like OP's brother often don't care about other's rights, but care very keenly about their own and are skilled in exploiting the system.", "You need to check up on tenant or squatter laws to make sure you can kick your brother out. He has overstayed his welcome and needs to go NOW. Please stand up for yourself and remove him before he surprises you with his ex and kid moving in. NTA", "Tell the girlfriend that you own the house.  She's probably rekindled the romance because she thinks he owns the house.", "Yours asked? Mine didn't :( Just took my stuff, then would try to claim it was his. Or would lose his mind screaming at me for daring to ask for something of mine back, and then destroy it.", "Then say No. when they ask why tell them, because you don\u2019t want to borrow it, they want to own it without paying.", "Generally because they're bigger than us, and by the time you're adults it's ingrained.", "You imply that we had a choice? If I had something my brother wanted it. If I was reading a book he wanted to read it, playing with Lego? His Lego ofc! (It wasn't it was mine)"]}
