He used to live with his ex-girlfriend, who lived with her mother and her grandmother, for a few years and she has a kid, but then she broke up with him and just in that time I moved out of my parent's house because I was able to buy a house thanks to my grandma's inheritance. \n\nSince my brother had nowhere to go and he needed to stay in the city because of his work, I told him to move in with me for a few months since I didn't want to live alone in a new neighbourhood where I didn't know anyone and my brother is more outgoing than me. \n\nHere's the thing (and I know a lot of people with older siblings can relate to this), my brother has always taken ownership of my things, if I have something that he likes or needs, he takes it without asking for permission. It has always bothered me when we were kids and we had awful fights because of it. Recently, he's doing the same thing with the house, he always refers to the house as his and tells everyone that he's the one who bought the house, when it was clearly me. It doesn't bother me that much because we don't really have any friends in common because of our age difference.\n\nNow comes the problem. He kept in contact with his ex because he has a really good relationship with her kid, but because of that, they were starting to get close again and she regrets breaking up with him. He tells me he doesn't want to get back together with her but I know him well enough to realize he's still in love with her. \n\nOne night I came home from work and my brother told me that his ex was going to come to the house because she was upset and had a fight with her mother. I told him that she coud come, but I didn't want her spending the night. He got upset with me and started questioning the reasons why. I explained him that I knew that he was still into her and that they eventually would get back together, and I if that happened, I knew he would want her to come live in my house with her kid and I didn't want that to happen. \n\nHe told me I was overreacting and got upset with me. She eventually had to spend the night because there was a storm and she couldn't go back home. The next day I told my brother that that was going to be the last time she spends the night at the house and he got mad at me again. He told me that he was living there too and he had the right to bring home whoever he wanted.\n\nAITA?\n\n*Note: He's not helping me pay for the bills or food because he's been having a bad couple of months at his work, but he does most of the chores around the house since I'm working and studying at the same time.", "created_utc": 1700921502, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183kkx2/aita_for_not_letting_my_brothers_exgirlfriend_to/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother is living in your home and trying to act like he is the owner. Let him know that\u2019s not acceptable.  Give your brother a list of rules to follow in order to continue living in Your Home.  No overnight guests should be rule number 1.

Your brother should not be feeling permission from you for overnight guests, but he should check with you.  That said, there is a very good chance your brother wants to set up housekeeping for himself, the ex, and her kid in your house.  \n\nMy advice is to nip this in the bud.

Literally nothing about that house is his, how can he brag about it. Managing a household is tough, it has a lot of credit and you shouldn't let him take that credit from you, no matter the circumstance or the context. It's a way of undervalue towards you. Now I'd understand if he was younger, that pride and immaturity is more common in young men since they take longer than women to grow up. However, he's 31. He's no kid whatsoever.

I told him that she coud come, but I didn't want her spending the night. He got upset with me and started questioning the reasons why.\n\nNow, to the main point. Right off the bat, he TELLS you, not asks you, that she's going to come. Period. \nYou can't just make decisions over someone else's house like that?? What the hell. Second of all, after you give him an extremely understandable answer, he has the audacity to get upset as if it's HIS house??? Who even gave him that authority. \n\nTo sum it all up: your house, your boundaries, your rules. If he doesn't like it, he can leave. When he starts paying rent, he can start acting like he has a say in any of it. Istg this man really needs to be humbled.\n\nMy advice is, stand your ground, don't let him get away with stuff he shouldn't get away with, and kindly introduce him to the respect that he owes you and your home. \n\nI hope it all goes well, take care <3", "\"He told me...he had the right....\"\n\nHe may have told you that, but that doesn't make it true. He has ZERO right. You need to make that clear. Now.\n\nGiven your history with him, I don't know why you would ever have offered for him to move in, but what's done is done. Fix it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is taking advantage of you and you are enabling him. He is a 31 year old man lying about buying a house when in reality he is freeloading at his sister's house.
