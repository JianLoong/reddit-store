I'm the junior coach of a youth wrestling team, I referee basketball three times a week and I love going to the gym and rock wall climbing. I get a discount at the climbing gym because the wrestling group rents from the same building and my head coach and the owner of the gym struck a deal. \n\nI have started to get into competitive climbing, both club and at my university and have equipment of my own. My brother and his wife (29M and 30F) are coming home for the holidays and he asked me if I knew of any trust exercises for he and his wife to do while they're in town. I told them I could get into the climbing gym on a good deal and he asked how much weight the harnesses and rope could hold. I looked it up and it's over 2000 pounds. He also asked how it was trust based and I explained about belaying and climbing and trusting your belay partner will catch you when you fall.  \n\nI have only met my brother's wife once due to him moving across the country, she was an average weight when I met her, however, I didn't know that over the course of 3.5 years, she had gained over 300 pounds and my brother didn't mention that exercise might be an issue.\n\nI didn't comment about her weight when we met up at the gym, just said hello, paid for our time and their rentals and went in toward the more difficult bouldering section.

I told him ok and kept working on my bouldering until my two hours was up.\n\nAfter I came back to my parent's house, my SIL cornered me and screamed at me, talking about how I set her up to make her look and feel fat and how I rub my athleticism in her face. I apologized, but she and my brother got a hotel room, and both of them refused to speak to me. So AITA?

Neither your brother or SIL informed you of her weight and how much of an issue it is for her. You treated her just like you'd treat anyone else - with respect and dignity. You made no assumptions when you saw her.   \n\nMy guess is, you would have gotten screamed at for *not* inviting them too.", "NTA. She had to have known what rock climbing entailed and if she was worried it would make her look or feel ridiculous, she should have declined the invitation.", "NTA. Like you said you couldn\u2019t possibly have known beforehand that your SIL is morbidly obese and it\u2019s not your fault. You were polite and didn\u2019t treat her badly plus you paid for them.", "NTA.  If you hadn't seen your SIL in years and your family had never mentioned anything about her physical condition, then you would not have known about her limitations.  Also, you told your brother about the gym and he didn't object at the time.  This weighs on him, not you.", "You need to ask her how you could possibly know how obese she was. Demand an answer.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou got set-up, but why? That is the part that makes no sense. You did not know, did as requested, basically got lied to.  \n\n\nWhen I know someone can do something I cannot? I sit and cheer them on.", "NTA. Seems like there was really no way for you to win in this situation.\nYour brother is a slight asshole for not warning you though. It sounds like his significant other has some serious shame issues with her weight gain.", "NTA\n\nYou were never trying to intentionally hurt your SIL. They asked what you like to do and you told them exactly what you enjoyed doing. It sucks for you SIL that she felt this way, but it was not because of something you did.", "NTA. You didn't know she was overweight. You just assumed she was at a normal weight (as that's how she was when you met her) and everything would be fine. Your brother could have easily mentioned it at any point in time.", "NTA - your SIL should have told you her abilities in advance", "NTA.\n\nYou can't be an asshole on accident. The one who is an asshole here is your brother. He knew what the activity would be and he could have easily guessed it would be an issue. And worse, now he is acting as if it was your fault.", "Fluffy girl here-you are so NTA.  You had no way of knowing of knowing she gained 300 pounds.  Your brother could have quietly let you in on that little gem upfront.\n\nBro and SIL need to apologize.", "Nta. You were nice to them and didn\u2019t comment on her weight. It\u2019s not your fault she\u2019s morbidly obese. She embarrassed herself.", "NTA\n\nObviously. Youd hope she's throwing insecurities back at you out of shame and embarrassment after your brother set this up, and that an apology is coming. But yeah, not even close to being an asshole.", "NTA. Her insecurities are not your responsibility.  If she thought rock climbing would be too strenuous then she didn\u2019t have to try it. She also sounds jealous.  Tell your brother that you had no idea it would be an issue for her and you are sorry they didn\u2019t have a better time.  (To preserve your relationship with him.). Really she owes you an apology.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHEY ASKED!  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"After I came back to my parent's house, my SIL cornered me and screamed at me, talking about how I set her up to make her look and feel fat and how I rub my athleticism in her face. I apologized, but she and my brother got a hotel room, and both of them refused to speak to me\" .. THEY Are the AHs, not you. YOU gave them what they asked for.", "NTA\n\nI'm disabled and if someone invites me to do something and I discover it's not physically possible, I may feel bad, but I would never take it out on them. Perhaps you could have asked about their physical fitness to make appropriate suggestions, but a 400+ lb person should know they have limitations and they could have looked into it too.", "NTA\n\nBut your bro is and your sil is an even bigger one. \n\nDo you mean to tell me that your bro and his wife did not have a conversation about doing this activity? What did they think rock climbing was going to entail? \n\nGive me a break. One of them had to be smart enough to realize she wasn\u2019t going to be able to do that.", "> my SIL cornered me and screamed at me, talking about how I set her up to make her look and feel fat and how I rub my athleticism in her face. I apologized\n\nI wouldn't have apologised, I would have said \"I had no idea you got so fat, no one told me.\" and left her to go be an AH.", ">my SIL cornered me and screamed at me, talking about how I set her up to **make her look and feel fat** \n\nNTA, she did that all on her own; but it's easier to blame you. \n\nAlso, your bro should have realized someone who is several hundred pounds overweight shouldn't be rock climbing. Did she scream at him too?", "NTA. Your brother asked for a suggestion and you gave one. He did not mention any physical limitations. He is the one who chose to do it. I\u2019m thinking there are deeper issues you accidentally got caught up in that lead him to look for \u201ctrust exercises\u201d in the first place.", "This 1000x", "getting the feeling he somehow didn\u2019t know what rock climbing is", "OP is NTA. However, I think it's on the SIL. I would think that a person that heavy would never agree to something so challenging. Unless, the brother didn't tell his wife what he had planned.", "I'm guessing that pun was intended?", "He had to know his wife would be challenged at a CLIMBING GYM. I bet he expected her to get all inspired to change her body.", "Our gym is somewhat accessible. My climbing coach is an amputee, and we have wheelchair users, both ambulatory and not that use our gym. I'm just sad it wasn't accessible for her.", ">But your bro is and your sil is an even bigger one.\n\nFreudian slip, or pun intended?", "My brother told me she expected the auto-belay system we had would hold her weight, it does not.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Perhaps. Wanting his partner to not be morbidly obese wouldn't make him an asshole, but the rest of his behavior still does.", "Yikes!  Def a slip.", "So it sounds like he got her there under false pretences if his primary objective was trust. Honestly, the two of them are ridiculous if they think someone 400+ pounds should be rock climbing as a beginner. NTA", "And that\u2019s your fault, how? \nIt\u2019s supposed to hold 2000 lbs. I suspect that wasn\u2019t the reason she couldn\u2019t climb. \n\nThey\u2019re grasping at straws trying to find something to blame you for."]}
