I told them I could get into the climbing gym on a good deal and he asked how much weight the harnesses and rope could hold. I looked it up and it's over 2000 pounds. He also asked how it was trust based and I explained about belaying and climbing and trusting your belay partner will catch you when you fall.  \n\nI have only met my brother's wife once due to him moving across the country, she was an average weight when I met her, however, I didn't know that over the course of 3.5 years, she had gained over 300 pounds and my brother didn't mention that exercise might be an issue.\n\nI didn't comment about her weight when we met up at the gym, just said hello, paid for our time and their rentals and went in toward the more difficult bouldering section.

Neither your brother or SIL informed you of her weight and how much of an issue it is for her. You treated her just like you'd treat anyone else - with respect and dignity. You made no assumptions when you saw her.   \n\nMy guess is, you would have gotten screamed at for *not* inviting them too.", "NTA. She had to have known what rock climbing entailed and if she was worried it would make her look or feel ridiculous, she should have declined the invitation.", "NTA. Like you said you couldn\u2019t possibly have known beforehand that your SIL is morbidly obese and it\u2019s not your fault. You were polite and didn\u2019t treat her badly plus you paid for them.", "NTA.  If you hadn't seen your SIL in years and your family had never mentioned anything about her physical condition, then you would not have known about her limitations.  Also, you told your brother about the gym and he didn't object at the time.  This weighs on him, not you.", "You need to ask her how you could possibly know how obese she was. Demand an answer.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou got set-up, but why? That is the part that makes no sense. You did not know, did as requested, basically got lied to.  \n\n\nWhen I know someone can do something I cannot? I sit and cheer them on.", "NTA. Seems like there was really no way for you to win in this situation.\nYour brother is a slight asshole for not warning you though. It sounds like his significant other has some serious shame issues with her weight gain.", "NTA\n\nYou were never trying to intentionally hurt your SIL. They asked what you like to do and you told them exactly what you enjoyed doing. It sucks for you SIL that she felt this way, but it was not because of something you did.", "NTA. You didn't know she was overweight. You just assumed she was at a normal weight (as that's how she was when you met her) and everything would be fine. Your brother could have easily mentioned it at any point in time.", "NTA - your SIL should have told you her abilities in advance", "NTA.\n\nYou can't be an asshole on accident. The one who is an asshole here is your brother. He knew what the activity would be and he could have easily guessed it would be an issue. And worse, now he is acting as if it was your fault.", "Fluffy girl here-you are so NTA.  You had no way of knowing of knowing she gained 300 pounds.  Your brother could have quietly let you in on that little gem upfront.\n\nBro and SIL need to apologize.", "Nta. You were nice to them and didn\u2019t comment on her weight. It\u2019s not your fault she\u2019s morbidly obese. She embarrassed herself.", "NTA\n\nObviously. Youd hope she's throwing insecurities back at you out of shame and embarrassment after your brother set this up, and that an apology is coming. But yeah, not even close to being an asshole.", "NTA. Her insecurities are not your responsibility.  If she thought rock climbing would be too strenuous then she didn\u2019t have to try it. She also sounds jealous.  Tell your brother that you had no idea it would be an issue for her and you are sorry they didn\u2019t have a better time.  (To preserve your relationship with him.). Really she owes you an apology.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHEY ASKED!  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"After I came back to my parent's house, my SIL cornered me and screamed at me, talking about how I set her up to make her look and feel fat and how I rub my athleticism in her face.

YOU gave them what they asked for.", "NTA\n\nI'm disabled and if someone invites me to do something and I discover it's not physically possible, I may feel bad, but I would never take it out on them. Perhaps you could have asked about their physical fitness to make appropriate suggestions, but a 400+ lb person should know they have limitations and they could have looked into it too.", "NTA\n\nBut your bro is and your sil is an even bigger one. \n\nDo you mean to tell me that your bro and his wife did not have a conversation about doing this activity? What did they think rock climbing was going to entail? \n\nGive me a break. One of them had to be smart enough to realize she wasn\u2019t going to be able to do that.", "> my SIL cornered me and screamed at me, talking about how I set her up to make her look and feel fat and how I rub my athleticism in her face. I apologized\n\nI wouldn't have apologised, I would have said \"I had no idea you got so fat, no one told me.\" and left her to go be an AH.", ">my SIL cornered me and screamed at me, talking about how I set her up to **make her look and feel fat** \n\nNTA, she did that all on her own; but it's easier to blame you. \n\nAlso, your bro should have realized someone who is several hundred pounds overweight shouldn't be rock climbing. Did she scream at him too?", "NTA. Your brother asked for a suggestion and you gave one. He did not mention any physical limitations. He is the one who chose to do it. I\u2019m thinking there are deeper issues you accidentally got caught up in that lead him to look for \u201ctrust exercises\u201d in the first place.", "This 1000x", "getting the feeling he somehow didn\u2019t know what rock climbing is", "OP is NTA. However, I think it's on the SIL. I would think that a person that heavy would never agree to something so challenging. Unless, the brother didn't tell his wife what he had planned.", "I'm guessing that pun was intended?", "He had to know his wife would be challenged at a CLIMBING GYM. I bet he expected her to get all inspired to change her body.", "Our gym is somewhat accessible. My climbing coach is an amputee, and we have wheelchair users, both ambulatory and not that use our gym.

Wanting his partner to not be morbidly obese wouldn't make him an asshole, but the rest of his behavior still does.", "Yikes!  Def a slip.", "So it sounds like he got her there under false pretences if his primary objective was trust. Honestly, the two of them are ridiculous if they think someone 400+ pounds should be rock climbing as a beginner. NTA", "And that\u2019s your fault, how? \nIt\u2019s supposed to hold 2000 lbs. I suspect that wasn\u2019t the reason she couldn\u2019t climb. \n\nThey\u2019re grasping at straws trying to find something to blame you for.", "Also, she IS fat. Fat is a description, not a moral judgement or insult. If she doesn\u2019t want to look and feel fat, she needs to make the life changes to not be fat. If she doesn\u2019t care about being fat (which is totally fine), then she should chill tf out", "NTA I am so stuck on the fact that she gained 100 pounds a year!!! Like... how??? Even with a medical condition that is literally insane. I really hope she is seeing a doctor because something is very wrong. \n\nAnywho, they knew what they were going to do, so... like, they could have said no if they didn't want to.", "NTA... if anyone is at fault its your brother for putting her in the situation... Its dumb for her to blame you.", "NTA but just know this isn't about you. She's struggling with living in a fat body, and especially if she hasn't always been fat she is I'm sure overwhelmed by how differently people treat her now that she's fat. People will treat you so horribly and it's really disheartening and there's a lot of research showing that this treatment is why it's so hard for many obese people to lose weight. All that said, you're not in the wrong here, you genuinely didn't know she was fat, especially not fat enough that this activity wouldn't be realistic. If you care about this person I'd sit them down and apologize for the mishap and say that you want to be an ally to her however you can be.", "NTA, but it seems like a really weird thing for him to ask his sister for anyway, because my first guess is he didn't mean *exercise* exercise, but more like a couples therapy thing.", "NTA you didn't know and she is 100% in the wrong for screaming at you. You've only met her once. What the hell is she thinking by disrespecting you while you helped them to find some sports?! Maybe, of you said swimming that would have been easier on her joints, she would also put you at fault because everyone is in swimsuits and she could not help but feel bad about herself?!  Good riddance they went to a hotel.\n\nI am obese as well (210 now, gained about 50 pounds in 6 months due to my thyroid) and would never have put that nor my anger on you.", "NTA you obviously didn't know so how could you have been blamed? \n\nYour brother and her should have known and realized it wasn't something she could do. Are they morons? \n\nBut your brother is weird why would he ask about trust exercises? Like who asks for that? What would that even be? Lol", "NTA: I really want to ask about your relationship with your brother and why you didn't know about the weight change but I completely understand she probably doesn't want that talked about and might be ashamed and not want people to know. I don't think you're the AH because you met her before and didn't know. If it was your first meeting, I'd think it would be a risky option. If SIL was on the phone with you when you suggested climbing and she agreed, then that's her own fault. If it was your brother that agreed, he should have thought about it and known his wife would be uncomfortable, or at least ask her if she's comfortable. I wonder if she felt compelled to agree because she's being polite or feels pressured to please you as your SIL she barely knows. Attacking you verbally when you got to your parents house is very inappropriate on her behalf. We are all allowed to have our feelings and you're valid to feel those feelings, but how you act is completely different. She was upset and probably embarrassed but she had no right to get upset with you. Even so, she could have been mature about it. Where's brother in all this? He should be the peacekeeper in all of this, shouldn't have to be but still should be. \n\nTLDR: SIL made her own choice, she's the AH. Where's brother? Being overweight sucks\n\nEdit: no one should be made to feel bad about exercising and being in good shape. It's hard work and deserves praise. Flaunt what you got, you literally worked your ass off.", "This was an embarrassing situation for her- she didn\u2019t come to the realization of her physical limits until she was already at the gym. She then, instead of holding herself accountable, wanted to focus the blame on you.", "NTA.  That's ridiculous if you had no way to know.  But if she's gained 300 lbs in 3.5 years, she has issues that are absolutely beyond control, and your brother is in denial if he's going along with her being an AH to you.", "Trust exercises have to be the dumbest thing ever. You either trust someone or you don't, all of these couples playing these emotional games need to grow up.", "No he didnt tell you. He should have been like look sis she\u2019s gaind like 300lbs and do you have any gym or activity\u2019s we can do when we come to visit. He should have informed you because she\u2019s probably already extremely insecure and embarrassed and no he put her in that situation not you because you were not informed.", "NTA\n\nClimbing is fun for all sizes at the gym. She could have enjoyed it\u2026. Even just messing around on the bouldering wall.\n\nYou aren\u2019t a mind reader. And it\u2019s not like you surprised them with climbing. You TOLD YOUR BROTHER in advance.", "NTA, I am 375lbs, your SIL is fucking delusional. You're not clairvoyant, you told your brother you were taking them to a climbing gym, she had her opportunity to say \"naw, not in my wheelhouse\" and chose to make a scene. Also you didn't set her up to feel fat, she's fat, if she has that big of an issue with it, she should solve it, not make it other peoples problem.", "I'm actually rather flabbergasted at this. I'm a little over weight. Not a lot, but my weight plus my height means I am not small. If someone offered me to go climbing, or do anything physical that meant putting my body into an apparatus, I'd immediately think about whether or not this was a good idea for me at my size. I cannot believe that a woman who gained that much weight didn't stop to think that strapping into a climbing harness could be difficult for her and her self esteem, regardless of the weight limit. Hell, most people that size won't even sit on chairs without being sure it's a good match for their body size, and she blindly showed up at a climbing gym and then said you set her up to feel fat? \nNTA, this is on her and her husband, for making poor decisions for their own physical and psychological abilities.", "NTA, but next time you make a similar offer, you should ask if any of the parties involved gained 300 lbs in the last 3.5 years. /s", "As a bigger person...why the hell would they agree to this? My ass ain't climbing no rocks lol NTA", "NTA Your brother is an idiot for agreeing to it.", "NTA why didn\u2019t your brother ask for something she could do like light swimming or maybe water aerobics? Rock climbing would not be my suggestion for anyone that weight!", "How on earth were you supposed to know any of this about her given her husband was not forthcoming with info. NTA but your brother is. This is his mess.", "NTA, she is just being a jerk because she doesn\u2019t feel good about herself. It\u2019s her issue not yours, hope she turns it around poor thing.", "NTA. Your SIL was just embarrassed and instead of taking accountability of her own actions blamed it on you. Your brother also sit you up.", "NTA. Your brother should have given you a heads up. How would anyone guess that someone gained 300 lbs in three years? I mean, I feel bad for her, but how are you TAH?", "NTA\nThis is on your brother and his wife. Sounds like she may be in a bit of denial and is taking it out on you", "NTA - your knowledge was requested and you offered based on what you know.\n\nAny accusation of you \u201crubbing your athleticism\u201d in her face seems to suggest the real problem: SIL\u2019s insecurity about her own weight. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to gain a lot of weight quickly and it can happen for a lot of reasons including medical ones.\n\nHowever, gaining weight is understandable and excusable. Getting angry because someone else is in shape is completely inexcusable.\n\nShe was probably going to get mad no matter what you suggested. She was going to get mad being in the same house and sitting at the same table as you. \n\nWorst case: she\u2019s thinking \u201cHow dare she be fit and active just to make me look bad!\u201d For your brother\u2019s sake, I hope she\u2019s not that bad and her insecurity is temporary.", "NTA - She looks and feels fat because she IS SUPER FAT. She knew what the activity was ahead of time and she needs to know her own limits. This is 100% on her and no one else, not even your brother. Being fat is fine, being an entitled asshole isn't.", "NTA\n\nThere were plenty of opportunities for your brother to mention she\u2019d gained a significant amount of weight. \n\nHe even asked what the weight limit was for the harnesses. \n\nBut there\u2019s probably something going on for her to gain that much weight in a relatively short time and your brother and SIL probably haven\u2019t realised or want to deal with it and that\u2019s a whole another can of worms.", "NTA, but my guess is she was lured there by your brother under false pretenses and she was super embarrassed to be there. It was easier for her to take out her anger on you, someone she sees once every 3 years, instead of her husband. \n\nJust curious, are you guessing she gained 300 pounds or is that a fact? That\u2019s A LOT of weight to gain in that timeframe. She would have to eat 6,700 over her maintenance calories a week to gain that much weight.", "NTA. Being fat sucks, but this isn't necessarily about fat. Some fat people are incredibly active. I'm pretty overweight and I work out regularly. What it's about is mobility limitations, which is something that your brother should have talked to you about. If being fat isn't a problem, it means that it needs to be approached just the same way as you would approach any other limitation. You didn't have that information and without it couldn't have recommended a better course of action.", "To me this sounds like the brother set up his sister to be the fall guy. Her brother did not  want to come out as a bad guy by telling his own wife she needs to lose weight and used his sister to show her the problem. \nNTA. Who doesn\u2019t know what rock climbing is? I\u2019m not super fit but I know I\u2019m not athletic enough to do it.", "NTA\n\nWow, shame on you for inviting someone to join you on a healthy, sociable activity.  (That is sarcasm.)\n\nYou did nothing wrong.  You did not owe an apology.  In fact, she owes you an apology.", "She gained 300 pounds!? So she weighs over 400?? I have never seen anyone that big in my life. (I\u2019m not American. But surely that\u2019s HUGE there too?)\n\nNTA at all. She is. How can she blame you for not knowing? They seem to both be delusional.", "That's alot!", "NTA. Your brother asked you to recommend trust exercises and you did.  This is on him.  He should have asked his wife if this was something she\u2019d like to do.\nSounds like SIL feels awful about her weight.  I wonder if your brother has been nagging her to exercise and has used you as an example.   I wonder if this issue is straining their marriage and that\u2019s why he asked you about trust exercises.\nTell mom and dad your side, and see if they can help sort things out a little.  Or text both your brother and SIL \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I upset you.  Bro said you both wanted to do a trust exercise while you visited and asked me for a recommendation.  I assumed he would check with you to see if this was something you\u2019d like to try.  I know climbing isn\u2019t for everyone and I\u2019d never try to force it on anyone.  I apologize for upsetting you.  In the future I\u2019ll be sure to check in with you about any plans.  I\u2019d still like to hang out with both of you while you\u2019re in town if you\u2019re up for it.\u201d", "NTA, how were you supposed to know about SIL\u2019s weight gain if nobody said anything? You literally treated her like a normal person and she blew up at you?! Wow that really sucks, I hope things work out in the end!", "another adult randomly screaming at another, another cynical read lol", "NTA but you seriously haven\u2019t seen this woman like at all over the course of 3.5 years? Not even a single photo?", "Youre SIL is over 400 lbs and she agreed to bouldering? \ud83e\udd28 I call BS", "NTA for helping out your brother, but . . .\n\nYTA for \"I didn't comment about her weight when we met up at the gym, just said hello, paid for our time and their rentals and went in toward the more difficult bouldering section.\" \n\nIt should have been immediately apparent to you that your selected exercise was not suitable for an overweight beginner. Instead of the \"more difficult bouldering section,\" you should have selected a section that was more suitable for your SIL, like maybe the beginner section. \n\nOr before going in you could have asked her if she was comfortable with what you had planned. Maybe a quick tour of the facility to show her what she was in for. She was your guest. You should have adapted as soon as you saw how she had changed instead of doing something that fit only your capabilities.", "Nta your brother should have known that his wife wouldn\u2019t be able to do the activity, or he should have told her about it and SHE should have known she couldn\u2019t do it. I\u2019m kinda thinking this is on your bro for not communicating with you or his wife.", "NTA- I feel like your brother set you up so you could be the one to tell her she is too big to do that.

You potentially saved your brothers life. Sounds like that trust fall could be debilitating.", "Fake fake fake", "First off, NTA. Second, she needs to go to a gym anyway. Maybe not a climbing gym but a gym nonetheless. I can only hope she reflects on this and does something about her weight, or your brother will be a widower sooner rather than later.", "ESH. Brother should have told you about SIL issues and SIL what activity they were doing. SIL should have walked away without a fuss when she saw she couldn\u2019t participate. But you say \u201cwent in toward the more difficult bouldering section\u201d. You saw your SIL, I presume you knew they weren\u2019t experienced climbers and you left them alone. As a sister and as the person introducing them to the sport you should have stayed with them at least until they were comfortable but preferably the entire time. At my local gym new climbers cannot climb alone their time, someone has to show them how and it should have been you.", "An honest mistake is an honest mistake my friend", "Sooo nobody has social media at 20? No pics of SIL for 3.5 years? I don\u2019t believe it.", "OP- I think that one thing that you may want to take away from this is that you are generally more fit and active than most people, and that you may want to take that into account when recommending things. Which is to say, you need to ask a few more questions about what their base level of fitness is. To someone who runs marathons, a ten mile run is not a lot. Someone you randomly pluck from the local mall and send out on a ten mile run is going to struggle a little more. \n\nYour brother probably could have done more research, but if he'd never been in a climbing gym, he really didn't know what to expect. I can't say you were flaunting your fitness, because this is what you do and love. But I think you do need to be mindful of your fitness if you are going to suggest physical things to other people. Since you work in a very physical environment perhaps you could think along the lines of what you would suggest for a group of your parents' coworkers, or a friend who is in corporate finance. Rock climbing is not going to be high on the list of team building activities in those situations. Sort of like how it's more reasonable to go on the easiest hiking trail with someone you have never worked out with than it is to try out the most difficult. And start with an hour hike instead of planning to be out for eight hours. Sight unseen, work with the idea that the larger population can manage about 25-50% of what they say they can.", "NTA.

If SIL fell from the top of the wall that rope would break (and you might go flying) and she would be seriously injured. To be honest I cannot believe the place even let her top rope. I mean even just bouldering, if she were that land with all her weight on one foot she could easily buckle and get a compound fracture. You can get those even when you are average or underweight but the risk goes up for SIL.", "Well, to be fair, it would hold her weight if she fell.

Those seats/ turnstiles/ booths are MASSIVE, it'll be fine!' only, of course, for us to get there and I can't fit and it's not fine. People have gotten angry with _me_ when they've realised, despite me telling them the likely outcome- straight sized people often don't really think too much about how people in nonstandard bodies are accommodated; very fat people, wheelchair users, visually impaired people, we're seldom on their radar.\n\nAnd if you're a big fat, you don't always want to be the person saying 'We can't go there because I will be uncomfortable' so you DO go along with things and put up with the discomfort as much as you can- you don't WANT them to realise that the narrow seat arms bruise you, the turnstiles trapped part of you and now you're in pain, the waiters are sniggering and saying things about you. You want everyone to have a nice time, so you keep quiet. \n\nThe malign version is that rather than talk honestly to his wife about her weight, Brother has attempted to shame her into 'doing something about it'. Lots of people who have never had more than the 'gained 5lbs at Christmas so stopped eating biscuits for a few weeks' kind of weight issues think that fat people are either too stupid to not be fat, or just don't realise we're fat. They're the people who call bullying 'tough love' and believe that shame is the most effective weight loss tool. I've had people set me up like this ('Come for a walk' - which I love to do!- is actually 'Come and climb this mountain', which happened on a holiday in Wales.

I'd gone up over 8 dress sizes. \n\nThat was my wake-up call and have got down to 83kg currently on a diet and weightlifting. Best move I could have made.", "Rock climbing takes a fairly high level of physical capability and existing knowledge. How would you select that for someone you barely know, regardless of size?", "Not sad enough to not carry on for 2 more hours doing what you do regularly to check up on your bro who is visiting though...\n\nThe situation was unfortunate - you weren't to know - but how you dealt with it was selfish imo.", "EXPECT YOU TOOK THEM ON THE DIFFCULT SECTION! \n\nYou did not utilize all those accessible devices. No you wanted to show off how good you are. You talk about how much involved in sports you are and the coaching you do but you FAILED here. A coaching FIRST responsibility is to KNOW their athlete's ability.  You failed! You should have started them off on an easy climb!", "She\u2019s on her way to one of my favorite TLC shows and a nice visit to Dr.Now.", "We even had the tangent about horseback riding, because Reddit is so obsessed with fat women trying to ride horses that I almost think it's a fetish.", "Haha, yes! \u201cThere\u2019s the wall, you just kind go up. Have fun!\u201d", "Okay, but there\u2019s absolutely no way that if SIL who was previously \u201cabout 150 pounds\u201d according to OP\u2019s comments developed a medical condition that caused her to gain weight that rapidly, nobody in the family would have talked about it. It\u2019s an immediate medical workup, not a \u201chey we\u2019re gonna be in town next week, can we meet you at a bouldering gym to do a trust exercise?\u201d This story is absurd and didn\u2019t happen, lol.", "For sure except Op said she had GAINED 300 pounds so she is most likely in the 450 to 500 lb range now, and I'm not saying these people weighing that much can do absolutely nothing but lay in their bed all day, but you have to admit being 500 lb will absolutely severely limit what you are able to do. And Rockwell climbing relying on another person to catch while you fall something he should have known would not be a good idea. Especially since it's clear the she is insecure about this which again is fine but he either didn't know that she was insecure about her size or didn't care which makes him the asshole.\nI just want to add because I'm tired of seeing this there is a point that a certain weight you can absolutely assume that person is able to do. I CAN assume that someone weighing 600,700, 800 lb can't walk up 10 flights of stairs. I CAN assume someone only weighing 100 pounds can't bench press 350 lbs. Sure my assumption may be proven wrong but most likely won't. I'm sorry but there is a point at the extreme ends that you can and should make assumptions about someone for their own health. I'm not saying you should look at someone that's 250 pounds and assume they're a fat tub of lard who never moves but yeah I'm going to look at a woman who is 500 pounds and assume she cannot Rockwall climb. Sue me.", "I agree! Though I think OP should have been a little suspicious when her brother asked what the weight limit for rock climbing harnesses is. Suggests he knew his wife would have an issue but didn\u2019t mention it to his sister. Sounds more like he\u2019s ashamed of his wife\u2019s weight gain and was trying to make her feel bad by using OP to do it", "I doubt he did this with the direct  hope and intention for SIL to blow up on OP. However, it seems possible that he may have been using this situation to influence SIL to exercise based on his actions. \n\nTo gain 300lbs in 3.5 years is extremely concerning, and if he is at all concerned about her health (which he should be as her loving husband), then I'm sure he's brought up exercising at least once. Plus, OP isn't a marital therapist or psychological expert. She's very clearly obsessed (in a good way) with exercising, and I'm positive brother knew that and was intentionally asking for actual exercise options for them to do together as a couple. Unfortunately, brother then proceeded to manipulate the situation by not explaining his part in it to inevitably achieve his goal of gaining her trust, but at the expense of OP.... her brother really sucks.", "A destroying trust exercise!", "There\u2019s probably some resentment at OP being in shape and athletic while SiL struggles with weight and what ever the root cause of the weight gain is/was.", "Lol because he fed his fat wife a story...", "Except when you do that you put the person onto a section that is tailored to them or at least is appropriate to their level. OP put them on the difficult section. I mean would you take a novice first time skier on a black slope to start? That is the equivalate of what OP did.", "I have a SIL who projects and I agree that this is probably the case.", "True", "They make harnesses strong enough in terms of weight rating, and I've seen some pretty large harnesses, but if she just gained 300 lbs and was already ~150 like OP says, then I'm honestly not sure in terms of fit. Rental harnesses are also uncomfortable already, and I'd wager that if SIL put one on and had to put her weight into it, it hurt. They're supposed to sit with the waistband around your waist and I don't imagine that working here even in the largest sizes I've seen.", "And I wouldn\u2019t recommend climbing as a trust exercise, especially to someone who\u2019s never tried it before. I get where OP was coming from, but climbing is other things before it\u2019s a trust exercise, and especially not knowing someone\u2019s comfortability, an open climbing session wouldn\u2019t be my first go-to. \n\nI also wouldn\u2019t be asking my kid sister about trust exercises to do with my wife, though, so it\u2019s all kind of weird.", "But they never texted the family group chat or video called?", "It's not that your math is incorrect (although it's extremely unlikely any single component would ever see a load of 3150lbs in a top rope scenario), but that you are completely missing the most important factor, while adding an element that doesn't make sense. The amount of rope out is one of the primary factors in calculating fall force. Also, a fall of 30 feet with a 5 foot fall arrest doesn't exactly mean anything. The factors are length of rope out, distance of fall, weight of climber and belayer. In a top rope scenario, the rope is slack free leading to the climber. Any fall would merely be the length the rope would stretch, and would put very little additional force on the anchor...maybe 900lbs total for a 450lb person. The harness can handle upwards of 6000lbs, the anchor more. The rope is going to be closer to 5000 lbs, but it doesn't really matter because it's a dynamic rope and will never see close to that force...not sure where anybody got 2000lbs from. Also, if you fell 30 feet on a top rope, both you and your belayer would be banned for life from that gym. There's no additional risk from an equipment perspective, when specifically talking about top roping. There are zero reports of a rope breaking in the way you describe, ever, including lead climbing which puts WAY more force on your system.", "Like I said, a food addiction. I don\u2019t think anyone said anything about OP, addressing this woman\u2019s obvious problem.", "No idea, but I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s not like my comment is -20 or anything. \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut yeah, \u201cgot so fat\u201d implies they wanted to get fat and had to put in the effort to get fat. That it is shocking how fat they\u2019ve become. \ud83d\ude05", "I commented above and found out that OP signed them up for a class, which means it's reasonable that they didn't stick around. But I'd like to say that your skiing analogy doesn't really hold in a climbing gym. I've been both an instructor in one gym and a customer in many and it's extremely common for brand new climbers to climb with very talented, experienced climbers. In climbing (top rope) you have to take turns, so other than trying different difficulties of routes it's not really a \"keep up\" kind of sport. Most experienced climbers remember being new and will help their new friends find simpler routes and walls to attempt, while giving them small pointers that everyone knows like \"step with your toes, not the side of your foot\". It's much better to have an experienced climber in the group of newbies because they (hopefully) actually know how to belay, and can help the newcomers practice safe belaying skills, and recognize more quickly if there's an issue.", "Your opinion is not a very good one.", "It is alarming to me that she gained that much so fast.  I hope she is going to the doctor to see if there is an imbalance of some sort that needs addressing.  I also wonder if hubby didn't mention her possible issues with the rock climbing because he didn't want to shame her.  What he should have done, was been truthful, OP could plan a different activity for them all that she could enjoy.  \n\nNTA, you didn't know.", "Did we ALL miss where OP said that she put these 2 untrained people on the DIFFICULT section?", "I couldn't never not ever think of it this way!", "Bro and SIL are definitely having relationship issues", "Oh, I read it totally differently than you did. I read it as OP paid for them all and then split and they went their separate ways, and she was the only one who went off to the advanced section. I don\u2019t know which of us is right, but hopefully that explains why I gave the judgment I did!", "I don't think OP brought them to the difficult bouldering section. It reads to me as she went there herself, hopefully after teaching them how to belay on a beginner wall although she doesn't mention if she did that or not.", "It's not *impossible*, but if true she should be seeing a doctor asap because it's pretty fucking close.\n\nOne of my patients weighs over 300 pounds. It took her *decades* and an endocrine disorder to get there.\n\nRaid weight changes in either direction are usually symptomatic of a serious medical issue.", "Earlier this year I injured my shoulder and required physical therapy.  The place I went for therapy also offers Pilates classes and, being in the worst shape of my life, and over my own deep reservations, I signed up.  Best thing I've done for myself in so many years.  Still have a little bit of range of motion issues, but when my shoulder is completely healed I've conscripted some friends to go indoor climbing with me. \n\nI'm thinking in February because I'm still working on upper body strength in general  \ud83e\udd23. I have only been climbing a few times and it's been rather too many years since, but I have a goal now.", "I lost 20 lbs without killing myself (or even really trying) recently -- went from 215 to 195 in a few months. it was mainly cycling regularly (low impact which is great for my terrible knees / previous ACL and meniscus tears) and walking a lot more that did it. \n\nfor food: my weight has fluctuated my whole life and I don't like the idea of temporary or restrictive dieting that I used to try for years. so instead, when I feel like I haven't been eating healthily, I just focus on getting back to a healthy equilibrium: Mediterranean diet, pescetarian mostly, remind myself to drink water instead of soda, cut alcohol down a bit... it's all done in moderation and I find it so much easier to maintain as a result!", "Lol, calm the farm. Don't attribute to malice what you can to stupidity, right? Which do you think is more likely: that your average person is stupid? or that your average person is murderous?", "Was he able to belay her due to the weight differential?", "Absolutely!! \u2764\ufe0f", "Climbing is really more lower body strength- think of climbing a ladder, your legs propel you up and your arms are for balance. You might be surprised!", "CICO??", "And? That still doesn\u2019t equal lazy or unathletic. It literally only means they consume more calories than they burn and nothing more.", "She didn't put them anywhere. She left them after paying and then headed to the difficult section to climb by herself.", "Yea\u2026let\u2019s work on our relationship by bringing my huge wife to rock climbing. It\u2019s such a terrible idea he must have planned it. Come on. No one looks at their 300lb friend or family member and thinks making them climb a wall would be helpful for their relationship.", "\"Logically\"", "I agree.  I'd put my money on the brother being clueless and then when his wife got upset, deflecting her anger away from him, which then naturally went to the OP.  A lot of guys do that deflection/avoidance thing.  \"Angry wife alert!  Hide! Deflect!\"  \n\nAnd we have a 30 year old woman who in a few years went from average weight to 300 lbs over weight.  That's a major change, and likely the result of something very serious going on - so she's dealing with whatever underlying issue is resulting in the weight gain, plus learning to live in an obese body in a society that is not very nice to obese people.  I think any one of us would be very sensitive in that situation.", "Right?

Breaking the laws of thermodynamics is an impressive feat", "That actually makes me suspect a disability more, tbh. I have been overweight my entire adult life in part due to an endocrine disorder, but after I got a neck injury that affected the entire right side of my body, I very rapidly gained about 40 lbs in a few months, because I had to quit running and weight lifting, both of which I\u2019d done regularly previously, and it completely screwed up my metabolism to go from pretty active to almost completely sedentary. I\u2019m lucky enough that I had the resources to see a nutritionist and a physical therapist and worked on integrating healthier diet changes knowing that I couldn\u2019t go back to my previous level of activity, as well as find gentle activities that I could do, but if I hadn\u2019t had those resources, the number very well could have kept going up. So to me, a disability actually makes a lot of sense as a possible cause for sudden and rapid weight gain if it affected her mobility.", "Sounds like a severe depression or something, to the point of constantly binge eating. I find it incredible to believe that she\u2019d be normal weight then gain 100 pounds a year for three years without some severe mental or physical problem.", "It takes a lot of muscle to move limbs that heavy.

She's an adult and able to make her own decisions.", "Whoa, nice! I have always wanted to try climbing but assumed that I'd fail since I can't do a pull-up. Thank you for correcting that misunderstanding for me!", "Right, the harness rating is to accommodate the added forces of a fall/catch. The more relevant measurement to determine accessible is waist and thigh diameter.", "Yeah agree.  But I also understand OP not being suspicious.  It was up to her brother to look out for his wife and sister, he failed on both fronts.", "I don't think the weight difference between the brother and SIL is mentioned? If SIL is 300lbs and the brother is anything over 200lbs that would be fine to belay each other.", "I think OP only showed them the bouldering area so free climbing. Don't know if that was the original plan to start the session with or if she changed to bouldering once she saw the weight disparity.", "No. Her body was very, very efficient in using energy.  Her body temperature, an indicator of metabolic efficiency, was below normal. I don\u2019t recall exactly, but she averaged around 96. The doctor said that her body made efficient use of every calorie. Human beings aren\u2019t normally that efficient. Heat indicates lost energy. Car engines, for example, waste a lot of energy.", "Because they want an excuse for fat shaming. Let's be honest, anyone who gains 300 lbs in 3 years has an underlying health issue. Either physiological or mental health. There will always be people who feel it's a moral failing that goes far beyond what judgment they would ascribe to any other illness. There's very little someone can be in life that generates more contempt than being fat.", "It\u2019s a way of saying \u201cnone of this applies if that is the reason.\u201d", "Agreed. My physical ailments were compounded by medication. I was eating 1 meal a day but was consuming more calories per day with the medication than the food itself. That's the biggest reason I shot up over 200 lbs in weight.", "Yep,  it definetly sounds like a medical issue.  I once gained over 50lbs in a year,  turns out I had a brain tumor producing extreme amounts of cortisol", "Well, I do need to compensate for the lack of biceps haha", "Climbing is a great sport (I'm biased, obviously) because it's very adaptative. When I climb with friends, none of us do the exact same thing on the wall in order to get to the top. It teaches you to know more about yourself and to trust yourself, since you have to find the beta that will suit your style. It's a bit of a mental game, as you learn to think differently and to find the solution to the problem from the ground.\n\nAnd it's a great social sport, as I've yet to meet a climber who wouldn't happily help you if you ask, or encourage you when they see you trying hard on the wall. When I started, I'd be struggling on some of the easiest boulders in the gym and I'd have climbers who were having fun on the hardest boulders cheering me on and giving me advice.

So don't stop yourself from trying, it might not be for you, but at least you'll have tried !", "I've never seen s gym that didn't have ground anchors or weights the belayer can clip into in the case of a weight differential.", "Tell you what I definitely trust bigger people on belay for me. The first time I went rappelling the person on my rope was my ex bf's sister who is a hefty lady, I was more worried she would drop me intentionally because her brother and I had long been broken up, but I was definitely not afraid that I'd move her feet off the ground. My ex and I together had to belay her, and we used safeties in case we fucked up but she was the one teaching us all this and she knew that bigger people need to have more people on their ropes. She had specifically gotten into rappelling because you have to hike up to the summit of whatever you're rappelling off of at least twice to set and retrieve your equipment, so she figured it would be a good activity to force her to exercise more, she learned to climb a bit after she lost some weight. She's still a big lady but she's very active and actually got involved with wilderness rescue in her state because of her rappelling and climbing skills and love of hiking, she says she's often on-belay for when they have to lower someone in a stretcher, unless the person is bigger than her she never struggles.", "Fat people can climb and wear harnesses?

But yeah, can't really do a push up. Last time some friends asked me to, I basically shifted all my weight to one side to push on the other arm and was stuck with one side up and one side down.", "It's literally just one extra thing to clip, and since they'd need to take a belay class together anyways, the teacher would have instilled that habit from the very beginning.", "A ground anchor literally puts all the force into a bolt into the floor, and if one weight is insufficient then you can just use two? I've belayed a 200lb difference and we didn't even need the anchors, i can't imagine 300 is much worse than that."]}
