Now if he wants to find a woman who has a history of fraternal twins on her mom\u2019s side and he wants to try to take credit for her genetics, that\u2019s on him.", "Definitely the AH, you couldn't wait to shit on him.", "NTA, fraternal twins have to do with the pregnant person having an extra egg in their ovulation and that has nothing to do with your brother. unless hes a transman who is going to be carrying the fetuses\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA, fraternal twins have to do with the pregnant person having an extra egg in their ovulation and that has nothing to do with your brother. unless he's a transman who is going to be carrying the fetuses", "NTA. And as a mom of 2 1/2 year old twin boys I cackled at \"having twins sounds like a nightmare\"", "NTA.  Your brother needs a lesson on procreation.  Twins occur when a woman either releases two eggs at once (fraternal) or the egg splits (identical), neither of which have anything to do with his sperm.  Ignorance on basic body functions is annoying af.", "NTA.\n\nCommon sense about people's anatomy should have been enough, lol... obviously there's only fraternal twins if there's 2 EGGS not if there's twice as much semen. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nHe could still become the father of identical twins though... so it's not out of the question completely. \n\nAnd while my mum is a fraternal twin, her brothers had been born singularly and my sister didn't get twins either... just because it's hereditary isn't a guarantee you'll have twins... it's just increasing the odds.\n\nHe can get over himself... if he's so immature to care about such a thing (more than the health of baby/babies and mother) than he's not fit to be a father.", "NTA. Your brother needed that reality check for the sake of whoever he ends up with. You did her a good turn there.", "NTA. He also comes across as a bit of a creep and very immature. Huge red flags for any woman he pursues. At this rate he'll be lucky if he has a single kid.", "As someone currently pregnant with twins I can\u2019t imagine wishing for this.", ">He took offence to that and had a little fit. My mum seems to think i should of kept my mouth shut and not \"burst his bubble\".\n\nNTA. A little fit?! He took offense to science? Your mom thinks you should let him bask in erroneous info? Better to have a heads up now than disappointment (or a big fit later).", "NTA - biology is biology. It has to do with the amount of eggs released in a cycle. Given that your brother doesn't have any eggs...\n\nYou were stating facts, not trying to destroy his dreams!", "Does he know how twins work? How could he possibly think his genetics would impact how often his female partner has 2 eggs released (or whether one splits after fertilization, but that isn\u2019t even genetic for anyone)? NTA.", "This is the silliest reason to get angry about. NTA", "Also, it\u2019s far from guaranteed even when on the woman\u2019s side! I\u2019m pregnant now. My Dad is a twin and my mom has twin sisters so I was kinda hoping for myself that I\u2019d have twins - I have it on both sides! And I\u2019m an older mom - but nope, just one baby in there. Very silly to be sure a rare thing is gonna happen for you even if it runs in your family!", "NTA. Your brother is probably delusional, and doesn't understand that he can't pick what will come out of the baby hole... maybe is just a cute baby, maybe is twins, maybe is just a wet rat...", "This dude has the same attitude as men who blame women because they had daughters instead of sons when gender is decided by the father lol", "Yup. I was about to say - I don't think he needs to worry about twins because he will never let go of Mom's apron strings. \n\nAlso, does this man understand basic anatomy? How does he think his sperm will magically make another egg appear? Is he like the people of the 1700's who think that tiny little people are in semen and they just grow in the woman? What is his plan, exactly?", "Meanwhile, fraternal twins do run in my family and my BIL's first question about the ultrasound for their second child was \"There's just one, right?\" He did not want twins to bring them up to three kids. I think if they had them from the first pregnancy, he would have seen it as efficiently getting them to two kids, though.", "I mean how was he envisioning that twins happen? For fraternal twins, two eggs have to ovulate - that\u2019s clearly something that only happens in the woman. Was he picturing his sperm, like, punching both ovaries and forcing another egg out somehow? \ud83d\ude02", "I can't quite grasp how people play this game of chance with themselves and their spouses where if they lose (and you have like almost no control) they have a child or children they are disappointed with. Come on people, don't gamble with people's lives.", "Exactly. It\u2019s determined by the genetics of the mother who will be pregnant, not just maternal line.", "I'm a fraternal twin and pregnant at the moment. Once my midwife knew I was a twin they actually checked more thoroughly if it was a twin pregnancy, like really waived that wand around (first ultrasound was vaginal) to the point I was thinking it can't be possible for one fetus to hide all the way up there and far to the side. Anyway, it's definitely not twins.", "My twin uncle had twins with his ex. Was that really just a coincidence?", "Yes, he could have a higher propensity for twin grandchildren if he has that gene and passes it on to a daughter, but not twin children.", "+1.  I'll never understand family cultures where informing people without any malice of a basic fact is considered an affront.  What a weird way to live.", "So she was a woman with a genetic predisposition for twins and had twins, exactly what op told her brother.", "... because having twins is hereditary for *women*. Did you even read the post?", "You\u2019re literally proving OP\u2019s point that it\u2019s hereditary for women. The whole point of the post is that OP\u2019s brother is male.", "He\u2019s saying that because he\u2019s a twin, he\u2019s going to have twins. He doesn\u2019t affect whether or not he has twins. She\u2019s trying to avoid him being disappointed because he doesn\u2019t affect whether the woman he gets pregnant has twins or not.", "The chance of having twins is entirely dependent on the mother, and the way her womb works. A man could pass that down to his daughter though, and she would have an increased liklihood of having twins.\n\nIt can also be purely by chance, as with identical twins.", "Twins either occur by random chance (identical) or a second egg present at conception (fraternal)\n\nThe sperm has no effect on either.", "He\u2019s no more likely to have twins than any other guy on earth. He thinks that because HE is a twin, he will produce twins by default. He needed to understand that that\u2019s not how it works.", "It\u2019s a much lower possibility than OP though. Men don\u2019t influence whether there\u2019s a multiple birth vs singletons, as he\u2019s not the one ovulating and birding said children.  It\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s not possible for HIM to influence it besides having children with a woman whose family has high twin rates.", "From experience is it? Im sure there are the good moments but twin pregnancy just sounds painful, plus the sleepless nights that will come after, then the mahem once their toddlers lol.", "Hope you're doing alright. I guess he wants twins since he wouldnt be the ones carrying them. Wish you luck and a healthy delivery \u2764\ufe0f", "Regardless of biology he could always have twins through adoption lol. But i dont think my brother will take to kindly to that suggestion.", "He\u2019s probably going to start looking for a girl who comes from a family with lots of twins just to increase his odds now", "NTA, just make sure to NEVER say \u201cI told you so\u201d when he has a single child and you\u2019re good. Just don\u2019t rub it in his face.", "That's actually not true in my in laws  family 2 brothers and 1 sister ended up with twins out of 11 brothers and sisters.", "One day he'll have a baby and when he sees how much of a handful they are he'll thank his lucky stars he's only dealing with one of them.", "Sort of. Vaginal secretions also play a role.", "This is what I was thinking too. Sounds like the type of guy to blame his wife for his broken sperm and their inability to have a son. It\u2019s best to break this thinking now before he becomes a nightmare for some poor woman who didn\u2019t produce the twins he was so proud of before they existed. The big brother is just being an actual big brother, NTA.", "Can confirm. My dad is a twin. My second pregnancy was twins. Although we think my dad and his brother are identical (never tested, though) so that may not translate since identical aren\u2019t viewed as having a genetic link. I was definitely pregnant with fraternal twins.", "A friend of a friend ended up with fraternal twins - twins ran on both sides of the family and the mother was in her late 30s when she got pregnant. Older mom's are also a factor. (I don't know her well enough to know if IVF was involved).\n\nAn older coworker had 2 kids in college and a pair of toddler twins. I asked a colleague if it was a second family situation and was told his wife of 20+ years thought she was in menopause.", "It means that somewhere in your uncles\u2019 ex\u2019s family tree that there were twin women. And typically if the mothers genetics are stronger than the man\u2019s.", "Yes. Fraternal twins (the only kind that are genetically linked) are more likely with women who have hyper ovulate, ie releasing more than one egg at a time during ovulation. Your uncle's genetics had absolutely zip zilch to do with how many eggs his partners ovaries released. Twins are actually not that uncommon in the general populace, so it was just a neat little coincidence. Especially if either set of twins was identical, because that's just a fluke of nature that isn't influenced by genetics.", "Sometimes, the only way people will learn is through the hard way. Trying to reason with them just doesn't do anything.\n\nHe still MAY have twins, but it is probably unlikely.", "Even if he was somehow genetically predisposed to having twins, twins are a high risk pregnancy. I know several people who started out as twins and then lost their sibling via miscarriage, stillbirth, or shortly after birth.", "But the universe has a sense of humor, so there's a good chance he'll marry a woman who has the twin gene, get a few sets of twins, and spend the rest of his life laughing at you about it.", "So true lol, I thought the same thing but I didn't want to say it lololol.", "Interesting.", "I agree with you and OP. I\u2019m thinking about what happened in my family and my extended family. OPs brother shouldn\u2019t expect twins, but he can\u2019t be \u201cshocked\u201d if by some chance it does happen.", "And there is possibility his *wife* will release two eggs on the cycle they're trying to conceive.\n\nI mean it's not impossible, just improbable.", "Hopefully someone tells him even that isn't a guarantee either! I know twin girls who came from a family of twins. They both had singleton pregnancies for all pregnancies!", "Okay I\u2019m going to bite.\n\nHow exactly do you think the two brothers contributed to the creation of the twins? They ejaculated the same amount of sperm as other men do, and even if they didn\u2019t it still wouldn\u2019t matter. They either have to find more than one egg (so the woman ovulated two which they didn\u2019t cause) or the embryo split after fertilization (which the sperm itself also did not cause, it\u2019s either random or the structure of her eggs that is debated). How did their genetics influenced the creation of twins?", "The men did not contribute to the egg splitting or the release of two eggs. Twins are hereditary maternally, not paternally. Your BILs did not cause the twins, their wives did.", "Anecdotes don't disprove data\n\nAnd no, a man's sperm can't magically create a second egg", "Fraternal or identical?", "Thats fine lol. I think i would be the one laughing though if he had multiple sets. That just seems like a monkey paw wish.", "Not really, there needs to be two eggs for two babies to form. Men don\u2019t contribute to how many eggs are released when their partner is ovulating.", "Right! I know twin sisters who married twin brothers. No twins were produced throughout several pregnancies.", "My family is rampant with twins and I had a singleton each time. Thank Christ. Every ultrasound I was like \"check all the corners for stowaways\"", "I always heard it skips a generation", "Or you have my family that has a history of twins, but everyone prays they don't end up pregnant with twins. Every single one of those twin births going back a few generations ended up premature with one of the twins dying at a few days old. The surviving twins were healthy (my great-aunt just died at age 96 for example), but they all talk about feeling a great sense of loss. Yes, modern health care is better and the chances of that happening are lower now, but no one wants that risk.", "They can split eggs though - as a mother of identical twins I can confirm they run through the male side.", "1 brother had 2 boys, the sister and the other brother both had a boy and a girl.", "Some men don't have a biology class stuck in their brain apparently. My husband wanted a girl, we're having a boy and he was like: the luck of the draw came from me. And we laughed. And I'm grateful my husband has some common knowledge that is very available in this day and age unlike in the renaissance.", "I had an ex freak out I was pregnant when my period started. I lost so much faith in men that day.", "My sincere apologies-I was not trying to threaten, but my writing was definitely not okay at the start of that one. I was trying to offer the advice that you should take the care needed to remember that there are people behind these posts."]}
