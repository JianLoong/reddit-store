Your brother needed that reality check for the sake of whoever he ends up with. You did her a good turn there.", "NTA. He also comes across as a bit of a creep and very immature.

I was about to say - I don't think he needs to worry about twins because he will never let go of Mom's apron strings. \n\nAlso, does this man understand basic anatomy?

Moms age and other factors can also contribute to the likelihood of having twins. Fraternal twins are no more alike than regular siblings. They can be any combos of sex. \n\nIdentical twins are totally random, and are caused when an already fertilized egg splits into two randomly. They are always either boy boy or girl girl sex. \n\nAnd yeah having twins is probably a nightmare but its also really incredible! If he\u2019s serious about wanting twins, when he\u2019s ready, he could try and adopt or foster. Tell him to start saving, twins equal twice the cost of everything.
