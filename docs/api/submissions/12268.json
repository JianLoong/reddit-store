So while yes his odds depends on his wife genetics on that aspect, he could well pass it on to his famale children (and all his descendants) and have twin grand babies. That said fraternal twins have exponentially increase the last decades for other factor the humongous amount of IVF, fertilely treatments.

People want specific genders all the time and many often keep trying until they have at least one of each, but others never get the gender they're hoping for.

He might as well know how it actually works so he doesn\u2019t continue to get his hopes up. \n\nMaybe he will have twins and he\u2019ll be super happy, but you\u2019re accurate in thinking that he likely won\u2019t have them. \n\nAlso, now that you\u2019ve told him, YWBTA if you keep pushing it.
