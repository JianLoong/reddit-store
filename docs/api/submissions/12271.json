I\u2019m not saying the kid doesn\u2019t suck (or that her parents don\u2019t suck because they obviously do), or that she isn\u2019t an entitled spoiled brat, but what I am saying is you could have thought that through, or even if you couldn\u2019t (we\u2019ve all been there) you could have apologized for what you called her (like an adult) and then moved forward with what she did was wrong (lying), it was obviously an accident, but that now your cats don\u2019t have their favorite lounge place/toy etc. whatever they use it for and you can\u2019t afford to just replace it because not everyone has disposable income.

I don't like when adults insult kids, but here it seems justified. Audrey seems to be a lil manipulative, poor Sophie.", "NTA\n\n\nYes, \"kids break things, that's what they do\", which is why as a parent you have to have some money reserved to repair/replace items their kids damage/break. And asking for an apology is very fair, of course she can't pay for a new one herself but she could be asked to go to the shops with you and pick out a new cat tree together and pay for it with her parents money. Her mother should have absolutely apologised too and offered to buy a new one, she's the biggest AH in this imo\n\nAbout the dumbass comment, I think it's a bit of an overreaction but it seems like you're fed up with your nieces behaviour and you only insulted her when she (stupidly) tried to blame an innocent party for it. People say things in the heat of the moment, I don't think it's a big deal, but it's valid if she's upset by that word. For this I think an apology is a good idea, only about that specific word. And again, the family should provide you with a new tree/money for one.", "ESH because you should never call a child names like that, even if it fits and they're horrible. but her parents seem to be worse because they're raising their child to be a spoiled asshole, so.", "Of course YTA with a dose of ESH.\n\nWho talks like this to children?

The fact that you reacted like this suggests to me you\u2019re not mature enough to babysit and if I was this kids parent I\u2019d be pretty upset.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s really telling you call one kid an \u2018angel\u2019 and one kid a \u2018spoiled brat\u2019. That\u2019s really mean and judgemental- they\u2019re both just kids! Sometimes kids mess up and make mistakes! When they do, we as adults need to correct them and show them how to do better.

You had the potential to be NTA, but you threw it away when you acted immaturely towards a child. And then made it worse by not owning up when confronted about it. I can also tell from the way you told the story that you still think the child is more in the wrong than you were. The difference is that you are an adult who most certainly has the knowledge and experience to do better, and she is a child who is still figuring all that out. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right, either. \n\nYou probably could have gotten it replaced and made a teaching moment for her/her family out of it, but you didn\u2019t decide to go that route.
