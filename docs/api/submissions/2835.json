I rented my own place and was at peace. My mother begged me to move in with her and my \"stepfather\" (sibs' father), both of whom were in ill health.\n\nI moved in, took over the cooking and cleaning, shopping, etc. About two months in my stepfather became immobile and unable to get out of bed. I pretty much waited on him hand and foot. I didn't mind; he had always been good to me. This included diaper changes and personal care daily. He passed away about a year after I moved in. I have always worked at home but this did affect my income. I had to pull a lot of all nighters, as well as watching him at night because he would get very agitated. We moved him into a hospital bed in the living room and I slept on the couch next to him.\n\nAfter his passing my mother understandably went through a depressive stage that lasted over a year and I literally did everything for her. She would refuse to eat. I spent a lot of time coaxing her to eat, making sure she was hydrated, taking her medicine, getting her in the shower, changing her bed when she was incontinent, etc.  About six months ago she popped out of her depression and started doing more for herself.\n\nNow the AITA part. My 4 sibs have always complained I'm not paying rent, even though she begged me to live here. Now that she's feeling better, they have ramped that up. I hear the \"you're living there for free\" complaint often. I still buy all the groceries and household necessities, take her out to eat a couple times a week, to appointments, clean, laundry, etc.  She is prone to falls and has fallen three times since I've been here.

She stays quiet during the conversations about rent and doesn't defend me, just says \"Oh, ignore them,\" after they leave.\n\nMy mother is pretty well off financially. I would be contributing more if she needed it or was struggling financially. I am not well off but comfortable; I don't \"need\" to live here. My sibs had a will drawn up and I am not included.

Your mother is manipulating you emotionally while simultaneously refusing to stand up for you.  The hard work and care you put in to caring for your mother's husband (your siblings' father) went unappreciated by them.  I think your mother knows that she has power over you, that you still respond potently to her begging you to stay, because you feared being abandoned by her and I'm guessing deep down still do.\n\nPlease reach out to a therapist.  Please consider moving out, and focusing your attention and care on yourself.  I'm guessing your siblings will eventually have to hire a caretaker for your mother and will realize too late what a good deal they had with you being her free, live-in, trustworthy caretaker.  They may beg you to come back, may even admit your mother misses you terribly.  I still think you should forge ahead on your own, living life for yourself.

Their choice.", "Hard NTA, a full time carer as you have been is significantly more expensive than the rent you would pay *if* that was even necessary. Rent might be reasonable if your parents were renting, or still paying the mortgage or you weren't already paying utilities. It seems as though they own the house and you already pay for food etc so draw up an invoice including all the things you already pay and a costing at market rates for the care you provided to your step father and the ongoing care to your mother, then deduct the rent they seem to think is necessary and send that to your siblings. To really drive the point home, you could also get quotes for in-home care to replace what you do. They are completely and utterly out of line and incredibly ignorant if they think persueing this is a good idea, its likely you would also have an excellent chance of prevailing if you contested the will as you can demonstrate the time and effort you have put into caring for your parents. (Jurisdiction dependant obviously). CYA, get the paperwork sorted, document the shit out of what you have done and be prepared for a fight.", "Nta\n\nBut keep in mind they are building a case to sue you when your mother dies.

You have no defense, and your mother isn't going to grow a back bone to help you now. While they will have her money, and more questionable legal support to help them. \n\nIt's great to care for you mom. But she's not going to be here much longer. What about your retirement? What about your future, after all this? \n\nGet legal advice. Don't wait for them to bury you, it will be so much more expensive. \n\nYou could be my mil. I wasn't there to help her, but you have a shot still. Please don't wait. I think my mil would 1000% be here today had she gotten appropriate legal advice. But she's not.

So just want to point out - wills can be revised, amended, thrown out completely and redrafted.   You could suggest to your mother that you can take her to another attorney and they can review the existing will, talk to her about her wishes and revise the will accordingly.  If she, for example, treated all five of her children equally under the will, your siblings would probably not have any case for you using undue influence on her.  Or she could leave you the house, which might be what they really care about, and split the rest of her assets between them.  Anyway, the main point - ask her if she would be interested in having an attorney review the existing will and maybe revise it.  You shouldn't force her and she seems so spineless she may say no but why are all those other children entitled to an inheritance if there is one and you are not, when you have not had anything from a father or your grandparents (which also sucks, reminds me of L. M. Montgomery who wrote Anne of Green Gables in part because her grandparents left her without any inheritance including giving her home away to their eldest son).

Did they even read it?!", "Good question.  I guess I'm just used to it.", "Didn't know that!  Thanks!", "A relative is an attorney and they brought an attorney (not my relative) from his firm with them along with a notary.   This was about four months before he died.", "Yes, and an attorney.  Stepfather was in a steep decline physically by then but could still carry on a conversation at that point.  The attorney explained some basic things, and they both signed where they were told to sign.  They were  at the house for less than 15 minutes.", "No, they didn't.  Just signed it.  The attorney tried to explain a few things, but it was very basic.  Stepdad was on a pretty steep decline by then, but could still carry on a conversation.   But they both just basically signed where they were told to sign.", "Doesn't matter. If he didn't have the mental capacity to understand what he was signing, the will can be voided. And if the attorneys attested that he had sufficient capacity when he didn't, they could face disciplinary action as well.", "Unfortunately,  that seems legal enough for my state. You mother can always redo her will.", "The notary needs to face action too.", "Without knowing what jurisdiction OP is in, you shouldn't be making legal claims and pushing her to take action, beyond maybe talking to a lawyer herself. You've also seemingly overlooked the fact that even if everything you've said is correct, he wasn't her father and so she likely lacks standing to challenge the will. I add the \"likely\" because I too should not make definitive claims on this matter, since neither of us can know what laws are relevant here.", "My understanding is that notaries just say \"Yep, that was the person who appeared before me,\" which would limit their liability unless they were also there as a witness.", "At no time did I suggest that OP would have standing to contest her stepfather's will. However, I'm reasonably confident (though I'm an accountant, not an attorney) that lack of mental capacity will nullify a will in all 50 states.", "It depends on where you are located. Some places have laws requiring them to verify that the person signing knows what is in the document. Where I am they have to verify you understand what you are signing. To me, this situation sounds like this would fail that but who knows. \n\nhttps://www.agingcare.com/articles/amp/457500", "I am a law student who is currently practicing (disclaimer, none of this is legal advice) and my understanding is the same. But neither of us actually even know whether OP even lives in the US, or a common law jurisdiction. Even if the odds are good, it's irresponsible to make those sort of assertions when the person could act upon them to their detriment.\n\nOf course, I'm probably overly conscious about that due to my chosen profession."]}
