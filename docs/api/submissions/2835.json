I was raised by my grandparents because she was a teen mom in the 60s. I knew my whole life (I have no idea how I kept that secret as a child, except to say I was terrified my sister/mother would totally abandon me because I adored her and it was drilled into me to NEVER TELL A SOUL) my 4 sibs did not know I was their sister until they were adults.\n\nBefore COVID I went through a divorce and walked away from everything to escape abuse. I rented my own place and was at peace. My mother begged me to move in with her and my \"stepfather\" (sibs' father), both of whom were in ill health.\n\nI moved in, took over the cooking and cleaning, shopping, etc. About two months in my stepfather became immobile and unable to get out of bed. I pretty much waited on him hand and foot. I didn't mind; he had always been good to me. This included diaper changes and personal care daily. He passed away about a year after I moved in. I have always worked at home but this did affect my income. I had to pull a lot of all nighters, as well as watching him at night because he would get very agitated. We moved him into a hospital bed in the living room and I slept on the couch next to him.\n\nAfter his passing my mother understandably went through a depressive stage that lasted over a year and I literally did everything for her. She would refuse to eat. I spent a lot of time coaxing her to eat, making sure she was hydrated, taking her medicine, getting her in the shower, changing her bed when she was incontinent, etc.  About six months ago she popped out of her depression and started doing more for herself.\n\nNow the AITA part. My 4 sibs have always complained I'm not paying rent, even though she begged me to live here. Now that she's feeling better, they have ramped that up. I hear the \"you're living there for free\" complaint often. I still buy all the groceries and household necessities, take her out to eat a couple times a week, to appointments, clean, laundry, etc.  She is prone to falls and has fallen three times since I've been here.  I pretty much take care of everything for her. \n\nThis came up again recently.  I said if I have to pay rent I'll just get my own place.  My mother got upset and said she doesn't want to live alone and doesn't want to end up in a retirement home. The spouses of my sibs have said she's not moving in with them. She said she didn't want me to move out; one of my siblings said that I should start paying rent then. She stays quiet during the conversations about rent and doesn't defend me, just says \"Oh, ignore them,\" after they leave.\n\nMy mother is pretty well off financially. I would be contributing more if she needed it or was struggling financially. I am not well off but comfortable; I don't \"need\" to live here. My sibs had a will drawn up and I am not included. I was also not included in my grandparents' will who raised me. So this isn't about hoping to get an inheritance.

There has to be more to the story because there is no way someone can expect you to be a live-in caretaker, pay rent, and accept 0 inheritance.

Tell your mom she either shuts down her children....OR you will move out. \n\nYou are caregiving, which is something people get paid for.

Your grandparents who left you out of their will were AHs for that and I don\u2019t think too much of your mama either.  Your life, your choice but unless your mom leaves you at least a life estate in the house, those siblings will toss you out before her funeral. Just be prepared and have a plan. Please don\u2019t get suckered into waiting on your mother hand and foot for the next 20 years and be treated like s&&t by your siblings. Maybe talk with a therapist to be real clear in your mind why you have made and continue to make such a commitment. Your life could be very different if you were out enjoying yourself instead of dedicating yourself to older people the way you have.

It's not your siblings business (though I agree with a poster who guessed they wanted more money to inherit).

Even if they do not want to pay, this will give you leverage to contest the will . Even if you do not want the money, do it for the sport: screw the selfish idiots...", "NTA. Start looking for your own place asap. It's sounds like your siblings would try to kick you out 5 minutes after learning yoyr mom passed. Talk to your mom about dropping by every so often to check on her.", "NTA, not their business. Butt out you nosey twonks!", "INFO:  how did they get a will drawn up without your mum? It needs a signature of the person the will.", "How can OP's siblings have a will drawn up that excludes her?  That makes no sense.", "If they want you to pay rent, your mom can start paying you for the live in nursing you\u2019ve been doing.  With back pay.", "NTA but you need to move out asap.", "Yes brilliant move. NTA. I hope Mom wills all her money to charity. What a bunch of knobs they are.", "She doesn't owe them anything should move out find your own place and let them take care of there mom. They will kick you out the moment she does.", "This was my thought", "This is the only answer OP needs to see.\n\nNTA", "I would add to this that part of the agreement be that the money you pay in rent to your mom come back to you in her will. You have been their caretakers, you should get an inheritance!\n\nDoes your mother agree with the will they have drawn up?? If not than can you take her to a lawyer and let her draw up her own?", "They didn't speak to me for a year after they found out I was actually their sister.  I don't know how that was my fault; maybe because I didn't tell them before?  There's actually a lot more to the story, but only allowed 3,000 characters.  lol", "This sounds shady. How can a lawyer draw up a Will for someone who is not his client? That could potentially warrant a referral to the licensing board. OP can still contest it and should. Caregiving round the clock costs more than rent and siblings clearly only care about money.", "Sounds like they think she\u2019s the mooch but they\u2019re the AHs!!  NTA op! I\u2019m so sorry you have to go through this junk with your siblings.  I can\u2019t believe your mom agreed to a will without you in it.", "They actually did zero to help out with their own father when he was sick except run to an attorney to have a will drawn up before he died, brought it to the house, said \"sign here and here\".  to both of them.  He was too sick to even read it or care about what it said, and my mother is useless when it comes to her \"real\" kids.  She pretty much just does what they say.", "Personally I hope mom wills all her money and the house to OP.", "Why doesn't your mother say anything when your siblings bring up paying rent?", "That sounds illegal to me. You're definitely NTA in this situation. You've been an unpaid caretaker for a long time , and it sounds like they've done nothing.\n\nI would should probably look into who has or will have power of attorney for the future.\n\nAlso, you could move into your own place that your mother has no financial ties to and tell your mother she could live with you there. That solves the whole issue of you paying rent.", "Yeah, I worked a case with a lady who did this to her wealthy dying husband. She went to prison and was forced to give back all the stuff she stole. You should fight for your part since you are doing so much of the caregiving and they\u2019re not doing anything but waiting for people to die.", "Fair", "NTA, but you\u2019re not being very good to yourself.  You\u2019ve been a 24x7 caretaker of your mother and stepfather, without any compensation or appreciation.  Your mother did not raise you, does not stand up for you, is not giving you an inheritance, and clearly favors your siblings.  Since you you can afford to live alone, move out and get some peace and rest.", "NTA. It sounds like your scavenger siblings are trying to \"preserve their inheritance\" by making you pay for the last years of your mother's life. It's greedy and disgusting.", "NTA.    How about retirement village?  I think they have apartments  and group activities and shopping trips.\nShe would have people to talk to.", "NTA leave take back your life and let them be her caregiver \n\nNone of these people give a damn about you", "NTA I feel the OP is trying to connect to her mom and have a mom for a bit before she passes making it not about the money.  The siblings are probably worried about the mom changing the will and including her in it for taking care of her.  For the siblings this is all about money.", "NTA \n\nOP please get some legal advice on this, what your sibs did with regard to their father is beyond the pale, it doesn\u2019t sound like he was of \u2018sound mind and body\u2019 when he signed and who were the witnesses to his signing? Did someone read and explain the will to him? All highly suspect and they may have some explaining to do \n\nPlease don\u2019t let these objectionable assholes walk all over you and your mother like this, it will only leave you feeling resentful and betrayed further down the line. Think of it as future proofing yourself and your mother", "NTA\n\nTell them there are 2 options - just 2!.  Either they kick in for an in-home caretaker for mom or they shut their pieholes.  Right now, you're the unpaid caretaker so are they really looking to change that?!", "NTA if your mum wants round the clock care, she needs to advocate for you. Also why on earth are you happy with this arrangement when no one is putting you in their will?\n\nYou've gone above and beyond for years despite there being many other adult children in the house.\n\nWhy are you letting yourself be treated like a second class citizen?", "NTA Ok then I pay rent but one of you takes over all the nursing duties. So which one will it be? (crickets....)", "NTA - you need to look out for yourself.  If your mom won\u2019t tell them you don\u2019t need to pay rent, then get out of dodge.  Also tell them in order to caretaker for your mother, they will need to pay you caretaker fees.  The only reason for them to resent you has to be inheritance issues.", "NTA, listen you were a free nurse and worked full-time. That is hard. I had to do it for 1 week for my mother and it was brutal. Your agreement with your mother is none of their business.", "NTA next time they bring it up ask which one of them would like to pay you all the past due caregiver bills for their father.", "NTA\n\nBut you need to revisit that Will situation with your mother.", "It sounds like the siblings don't want the job of caring for Mom, but will kick OP out as soon as she passes or has to go to Assisted living.\nDon't give up your life to take care of your Mom and be treated like garbage by your half siblings.", "Or the Mom could pay her ..??", "Yeah that is not a valid will."]}
