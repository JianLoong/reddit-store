My wife recently developed a fear of the dog after confirming her pregnancy. She wanted to re-home the dog, either by giving him back to my buddy we originally got him from (as his dog that gave birth to mine has since died) or by finding some other nice family to take him. Obviously, that didn't make any sense, for a number of reasons, but her anxiety was overwhelming her.\n\nWe read some stuff about pregnant women developing sudden fear and hatred towards pets and how common this phenomena is. Several people shared their personal stories on my original post, but I couldn't show her those because I didn't tell her about the original post. There were too many people saying mean things on it. But I found similar stories elsewhere online, and she found them reassuring.\n\nWe've been training the dog on how to be around babies. Well, my son is training him. So far a former coworker of mine and a neighbor have let me borrow their babies for an evening, and both times went really well. So we will continue to enforce appropriate baby behavior with the dog.\n\nMy wife visited her OBGYN to discuss her fear and anxiety, and she again was reassured that many women face similar experiences when pregnant. She is going to start seeing someone to discuss her changing emotional state. She also decided she wants to spend as little time as possible with the dog for now. So we've all been accommodating that, and the dog is now spending the majority of his indoor time in my son's room instead of the living room when my wife is home. So far the dog doesn't mind, as he sleeps in there anyway, and that's where his best friend lives. Our home continues to be harmonious.\n\nI appreciate all the people who provided productive information and outlooks on the last post.", "created_utc": 1673552301, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10a8i7u/update_we_are_preparing_the_dog_for_our_baby_and/", "score": 5187, "replies": ["Saw your first post!

I said that it sounded like they found a solution. OP may have figured something out for now, but there are countless stories of dog people keeping the dog at the expense of their partner and child, even when they do run into issues of children being knocked down, nipped, bitten, etc. By the way you're taking this so over the top, I have to assume you are pretty emotionally compromised with this topic and so I won't take your overblown and hyperbolic statements as anything but a lack of common sense and experience.\n\nHow is this an irrational fear, by the way? You're more likely to be injured by a dog than every other animal, combined. Dog bites are a continuous public health issue.\n\n\"Dog bite injuries are common and devastating with an annual incidence of 12.9 per 10,000 persons.1 Children are disproportionately affected compared with adults.

I picked a couple of breeds at random for size comparison.", "Yes. And if you have access to multiple practice babies and babies and toddlers at different levels of development, doing this with as many of them as possible and in as many settings as possible will really help doggo remember best.

My dog Max does not like strangers in the slightest, so we were concerned about having kids. Once we\u2019ve introduced him to someone, he\u2019s fine, but those were all adults, not babies. When my daughter was born, my husband took the little hat they put on the baby as soon as they\u2019re born and brought it home to Max (yes, the one covered in blood and fluids,) as well as the baby blanket they first wrapped around her, and let him sniff it while giving him praise and pets. He left them with him when he came back to the hospital. \n\nMax was completely gentle with her once we brought her home. I have pictures of him staring adoringly at her while she\u2019s doing tummy time, and six years later, he\u2019s a dream dog with our 20 month old son, and he sleeps on my daughter\u2019s bed every night. And if someone so much as even tries to tickle her or the baby when they don\u2019t want it, Max is there, shoving his full 75 lbs weight between the kids and the \u201caggressor\u201d And staring them down hard. \n\nI won\u2019t trust my dog with a stranger until we\u2019ve properly introduced them, but I trust him with my children\u2019s lives and safety any day of the week.", "I do love a good ending.", "Oh wonderful, I know how much that dog means to yall from your first post.

Yes you do say originally that it's good they seem to have found a solution, then you start to make ridiculous assertions and accusations about OP. But it's clear to see you're a dog hater, so it's not going to get through to you that this irrational fear of pets is a recognised medical phenomenon when people are going through a pregnancy, because that would also require you to actually read OPs update and not just make stuff up.\n\nSecondly, all this talk of dog bite is entirely a straw man, as OPs original post is about how the wife is afraid the dog will knock her over or that the anxiety involved will harm the pregnancy, not that the dog will bite a child. But that would also require you to have read all of that instead of fruitlessly hallucinating.\n\nThirdly a thing doesn't have to be completely 100% safe to be an irrational fear. Fear of flying is an irrational fear, even though planes crash. Fear of spiders, irrational, despite the many poisonous varieties. Same for snakes. Needles can easily puncture a major blood vessel or accidentally inject air, still irrational.\n\nAlso your personal attacks are very droll, but they don't make up for a lack of knowledge or ability to rationalise. All the scenarios  Iput forward were possible and there have been multiple accounts of them taking place. Which according to OPs original post is all the wife needed, the very idea that it couldn't be 100% guaranteed meant she couldn't cope, which is how we know that she needs mental help, because of course most things cant be 100% guaranteed.\n\nBut to play your game, should the husband support her if she wishes to rip out and throw away the bathtub? After all, the CDC reports the leading cause of infant deaths between the ages of 1 and 4 to be drowning. And once the kid gets over 4, should he support his wife in never letting their child use a motor vehicle, because that's the leading cause of child deaths in the 5+ range?\n\n https://www.cdc.gov/injury/features/child-injury/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fsafechild%2Ffalls%2Findex.html", "I hope your wife is able to work through her emotions and fears.", "Not sure if you will ever see this, but this (hilariously) backfired for us.

Think of: Gently pulling his ears, playing with the tail, etc. That way, the dog is more likely to tolerate this if the baby accidentally does it.\r  \n\r  \nBuy some stuffed animals/other baby toys and throw them on the floor, getting closer and closer to the dog. If he doesn't take it then he gets a candy. In this way, the dog learns that there are things that he is not allowed to play with, no matter how much fun it is.\r  \n\r  \nWhen the baby is here:\r  \nNever leave the baby alone with the dog, not even for a short while. Put either the dog or the baby somewhere so they can't get together.\r  \n\r  \nTeach the baby to leave the dog alone when he: sleeps, eats or is in his place/crate.\r  \n\r  \nTeach the baby that the dog toys/cuddly toys belong to the dog and that the baby is not allowed to play with them.\r  \n\r  \nIntervene as soon as the baby touches the dog. Baby may only pet the dog under adult supervision.\r  \n\r  \nLearn to recognize your dog's signals when he is uncomfortable with something someone is doing. Our oldest dog always looks at us with a desperate look \"help\", only then comes a growl.

But I think it\u2019s alarming your wife was willing to get rid of your son\u2019s support animal and best friend that comforted him after his mom passed.  It shows a lack of respect to your son.  I think it\u2019s something worth watching once her bio child is born.  What other changes will she want to make?", "Glad you are keeping the dog! As someone who was born into a family with two dogs that were each 100lbs+ (and who\u2019s had many large dogs since), I think things will work out just fine! In my experience, the bigger the dog the more gentle they are with kids! By time the baby is mobile, the dog will have adjusted to the situation. The only things I would watch out for: If the dog is excited and jumping around, he may knock the baby over accidentally. And don\u2019t let the baby pull on the dogs tail, ears, or mess with his food etc. A lot of (most) dogs have a really high tolerance for that kind of stuff, but better safe than sorry.", "I\u2019m glad you were able to come to a solution and I\u2019m so happy your dog is doing well with the baby training.", "I\u2019m glad things worked out, but it\u2019s a little unfair that your sons dog has to stay confined to one room because his step mom suddenly developed a \u201cfear\u201d of dogs and wants to spend as little time as possible with him.", "This is such a good update.

What would be the point of posting the thread if advice wasn\u2019t wanted?", "So I've always heard that babies and puppies give off a certain scent to older dogs that allows them to know to be more gentle with them. While I'm no expert and the scent thing might be made up it is 100% true that dogs know the difference. I have two bigger dogs that rough house non stop with each other and my husband/myself. I got pregnant with my first and suddenly they wouldn't play as rough with/near me. When we brought my daughter home they were like different dogs - even with essentially no previous baby interaction they just knew that they needed to be very careful around her. If your pup is already as mellow as he seems I would be very surprised to hear that they're anything less than amazing with your new little one", ">I want the treat NOW! So he just jumps up and gives me both paws. He's probably like, if I g\n\nSame with our dogs. We taught them to shake hands, and then they randomly give us their paws when they are hungry for treats. Like for example I am typing away on my laptop and one (or more, we have three) of the dogs come and put their paw on my leg or my arm if they can reach. And then waits, as in \"ok, I gave you my paw, where's my treat\".", "I sometimes tell the story of my current service dog and the mail truck, with the same result.  She's supposed to alert me to the doorbell or the door knock.  USPS will knock when they drop off something, where other delivery services won't.  A few months after I got her, she suddenly led me to the door, but there was no one there and no package.  This happened a couple more times over the next few weeks.  One day I happened to be standing by a window facing the road and saw the mail truck pass by - didn't stop - but my dog promptly led me to the door.  I began to suspect at this point, and it was confirmed a little while later.  She had learned the sound of the mail truck, and knew that if she heard it, it was possible there would be a door knock, and THEN she'd get treats.  She simply decided to not wait for the knock..."]}
