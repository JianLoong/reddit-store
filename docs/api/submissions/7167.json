{"id": 7167, "submission_id": "10a8i7u", "title": "Update: We are preparing the dog for our baby, and my wife is taking steps to safeguard her mental state", "selftext": "My son has had a dog, half great dane, half unknown canine Casanova, for six years. My wife recently developed a fear of the dog after confirming her pregnancy. She wanted to re-home the dog, either by giving him back to my buddy we originally got him from (as his dog that gave birth to mine has since died) or by finding some other nice family to take him. Obviously, that didn't make any sense, for a number of reasons, but her anxiety was overwhelming her.\n\nWe read some stuff about pregnant women developing sudden fear and hatred towards pets and how common this phenomena is. Several people shared their personal stories on my original post, but I couldn't show her those because I didn't tell her about the original post. There were too many people saying mean things on it. But I found similar stories elsewhere online, and she found them reassuring.\n\nWe've been training the dog on how to be around babies. Well, my son is training him. So far a former coworker of mine and a neighbor have let me borrow their babies for an evening, and both times went really well. So we will continue to enforce appropriate baby behavior with the dog.\n\nMy wife visited her OBGYN to discuss her fear and anxiety, and she again was reassured that many women face similar experiences when pregnant. She is going to start seeing someone to discuss her changing emotional state. She also decided she wants to spend as little time as possible with the dog for now. So we've all been accommodating that, and the dog is now spending the majority of his indoor time in my son's room instead of the living room when my wife is home. So far the dog doesn't mind, as he sleeps in there anyway, and that's where his best friend lives. Our home continues to be harmonious.\n\nI appreciate all the people who provided productive information and outlooks on the last post.", "created_utc": 1673552301, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10a8i7u/update_we_are_preparing_the_dog_for_our_baby_and/", "score": 707, "replies": ["Saw your first post!

I\u2019m glad she decided to be honest with professional about all this instead of digging her heels in and forcing you to get rid of him. I have a Great Dane that has been around all my nieces and nephews as babies and never once had he ever don\u2019t anything to harm any of them. They\u2019re gentle giant but I get people, including pregnant women, get scared of their size. I truly hope she\u2019s able to get rid of this fear. Please update again!", "Yay!  I'm glad this one is working out well.  Happy to see your wife is getting help, and that you all have found a compromise that is working.

Props to all of you (and the dog too, who I'm sure is approaching their training like a pro!) for communicating, compromising and working through all this for the good of your family.", "OPs that write updates are the best.

Wishing you and the family a happy and safe pregnancy.", "NAH I thought you were going to post that you'd gotten a [coyote vest](https://www.coyotevest.com/) for the baby.", "I am glad this worked out. We have an 8 year old Blue Heeler and when I was pregnant with  my 15 month old son and for the first 6 months after he was born I was terrified of our dog being near me/him. Mainly the baby and my belly though. I finally let them around each other and saw how amazing Apache was around my son and now they are best friends. I can't even call him MY dog anymore, he is definitely our son's dog lol. He calls him bubba, I love it", "I'm so glad you're working through it. \nOne step at a time.", "Thank you for the update. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re figuring it out. \n\nThank you also for treating your wife\u2019s anxieties with compassion rather than disdain like so many people on that post did. Of course getting rid of the dog isn\u2019t an option but looking for productive ways to help your wife manage her anxiety was the way to handle it, not dismissing and insulting her like so many comments did.", "They were really excited about the free babysitting. A level of excitement that, to be honest, made me nervous.", "People love free babysitting.", "I LOLed hard at this. I totally understand loving free babysitting!!!

Hopefully she's comforted by the \"baby training\" and will continue to improve.", "When I brought my baby home from the hospital, I sat on the floor (I\u2019m not going to tell you how bad that hurt lol) and let my dog approach me on her own terms. She kinda sneaked up gingerly - it was so cute. Then she sniffed the baby and curled up on the floor next to me. It took her about 30 seconds to decide that protecting the baby was her life\u2019s work. She was 6-7 years old at the time and they became best friends. I think the default setting for dogs is to be gentle around babies. My current dog is so gentle around my grandkids even though I don\u2019t have small kids around. Your dog will be great and will love being a \u201cbig brother.\u201d Congratulations \u2764\ufe0f", "I do hope this works out but you better be prepared to re-home the dog in the worst case, such as any aggressive behavior or injuries from the dog.

Of course OP would be TA IF the dog ever showed any sign of aggression but that's a pretty long long reach at this point. OPs original post was about his wife's unfounded fears and her mad suggestion they get rid of the dog because of it. Now we get a positive update, and your response is to tell him he could be a future AH if the whole situation literally changes from how it is now \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Right if the dog is not kid friendly and mauls the baby what the going to say \u201coops sorry it didn\u2019t workout as planned\u201d", "a really good outcome.

Babies get disfigured by dogs every year. The wife is not having irrational fears, she's having unfounded fears about a real possible danger. All I'm saying is the husband is NTA for trying to find a solution, but he would be if he convinces himself that getting rid of the dog would never be the solution.", "Being the father of an infant for the second time is going to be so much fun!

My son holds the baby and puts treats in their hands to \"give\" the dog while giving the dog commands. After the dog follows the commands the \"baby\" (actually my son) gives the dog a treat. So the dog learns that babies are humans (authority figures) and need to be treated respectfully and not puppies or some strange interloper animal that can be played roughly with.\n\nThe dog also gets used to the sounds babies make so he won't find them upsetting or stressful later on.", "Large dogs aren\u2019t any more dangerous to children than small dogs are. \n\nIn fact, as small dogs have more energy they are more likely to knock children over.", "Fascinating", "This is so wonderful.
