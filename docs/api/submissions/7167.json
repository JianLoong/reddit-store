My wife recently developed a fear of the dog after confirming her pregnancy. She wanted to re-home the dog, either by giving him back to my buddy we originally got him from (as his dog that gave birth to mine has since died) or by finding some other nice family to take him. Obviously, that didn't make any sense, for a number of reasons, but her anxiety was overwhelming her.\n\nWe read some stuff about pregnant women developing sudden fear and hatred towards pets and how common this phenomena is. Several people shared their personal stories on my original post, but I couldn't show her those because I didn't tell her about the original post. There were too many people saying mean things on it. But I found similar stories elsewhere online, and she found them reassuring.\n\nWe've been training the dog on how to be around babies. Well, my son is training him. So far a former coworker of mine and a neighbor have let me borrow their babies for an evening, and both times went really well. So we will continue to enforce appropriate baby behavior with the dog.\n\nMy wife visited her OBGYN to discuss her fear and anxiety, and she again was reassured that many women face similar experiences when pregnant. She is going to start seeing someone to discuss her changing emotional state. She also decided she wants to spend as little time as possible with the dog for now. So we've all been accommodating that, and the dog is now spending the majority of his indoor time in my son's room instead of the living room when my wife is home. So far the dog doesn't mind, as he sleeps in there anyway, and that's where his best friend lives. Our home continues to be harmonious.\n\nI appreciate all the people who provided productive information and outlooks on the last post.", "created_utc": 1673552301, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10a8i7u/update_we_are_preparing_the_dog_for_our_baby_and/", "score": 2581, "replies": ["Saw your first post!

I said that it sounded like they found a solution. OP may have figured something out for now, but there are countless stories of dog people keeping the dog at the expense of their partner and child, even when they do run into issues of children being knocked down, nipped, bitten, etc. By the way you're taking this so over the top, I have to assume you are pretty emotionally compromised with this topic and so I won't take your overblown and hyperbolic statements as anything but a lack of common sense and experience.\n\nHow is this an irrational fear, by the way? You're more likely to be injured by a dog than every other animal, combined. Dog bites are a continuous public health issue.\n\n\"Dog bite injuries are common and devastating with an annual incidence of 12.9 per 10,000 persons.1 Children are disproportionately affected compared with adults.

I picked a couple of breeds at random for size comparison.", "Yes. And if you have access to multiple practice babies and babies and toddlers at different levels of development, doing this with as many of them as possible and in as many settings as possible will really help doggo remember best.

My dog Max does not like strangers in the slightest, so we were concerned about having kids. Once we\u2019ve introduced him to someone, he\u2019s fine, but those were all adults, not babies. When my daughter was born, my husband took the little hat they put on the baby as soon as they\u2019re born and brought it home to Max (yes, the one covered in blood and fluids,) as well as the baby blanket they first wrapped around her, and let him sniff it while giving him praise and pets. He left them with him when he came back to the hospital. \n\nMax was completely gentle with her once we brought her home. I have pictures of him staring adoringly at her while she\u2019s doing tummy time, and six years later, he\u2019s a dream dog with our 20 month old son, and he sleeps on my daughter\u2019s bed every night. And if someone so much as even tries to tickle her or the baby when they don\u2019t want it, Max is there, shoving his full 75 lbs weight between the kids and the \u201caggressor\u201d And staring them down hard. \n\nI won\u2019t trust my dog with a stranger until we\u2019ve properly introduced them, but I trust him with my children\u2019s lives and safety any day of the week.", "I do love a good ending.", "Oh wonderful, I know how much that dog means to yall from your first post.

Yes you do say originally that it's good they seem to have found a solution, then you start to make ridiculous assertions and accusations about OP. But it's clear to see you're a dog hater, so it's not going to get through to you that this irrational fear of pets is a recognised medical phenomenon when people are going through a pregnancy, because that would also require you to actually read OPs update and not just make stuff up.\n\nSecondly, all this talk of dog bite is entirely a straw man, as OPs original post is about how the wife is afraid the dog will knock her over or that the anxiety involved will harm the pregnancy, not that the dog will bite a child. But that would also require you to have read all of that instead of fruitlessly hallucinating.\n\nThirdly a thing doesn't have to be completely 100% safe to be an irrational fear. Fear of flying is an irrational fear, even though planes crash. Fear of spiders, irrational, despite the many poisonous varieties. Same for snakes. Needles can easily puncture a major blood vessel or accidentally inject air, still irrational.\n\nAlso your personal attacks are very droll, but they don't make up for a lack of knowledge or ability to rationalise. All the scenarios  Iput forward were possible and there have been multiple accounts of them taking place. Which according to OPs original post is all the wife needed, the very idea that it couldn't be 100% guaranteed meant she couldn't cope, which is how we know that she needs mental help, because of course most things cant be 100% guaranteed.\n\nBut to play your game, should the husband support her if she wishes to rip out and throw away the bathtub? After all, the CDC reports the leading cause of infant deaths between the ages of 1 and 4 to be drowning. And once the kid gets over 4, should he support his wife in never letting their child use a motor vehicle, because that's the leading cause of child deaths in the 5+ range?\n\n https://www.cdc.gov/injury/features/child-injury/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fsafechild%2Ffalls%2Findex.html", "I hope your wife is able to work through her emotions and fears.", "Not sure if you will ever see this, but this (hilariously) backfired for us.

I laughed too much reading this. \n\nBack when my eldest was a toddler, my terrified husband sent me an article outlining the 5 most dangerous things to have in a house for a child. An unsympathetic me sent him back a badly compiled photoshop of a new toy I was working on- a trampoline built on ladders, guns, and swords. I am still looking for the best wall space to hang it on.", "I have tripped over my friend\u2019s tiny dogs more times than I can count. They love to run around my feet and, being so small, I don\u2019t know that they are there.", "Idiot. Hang your head in shame. You are one pathetic loser.", "Great update.  Your son is going to be a great brother.", "I'm so glad to see someone working the right way to make it work. Nice job!", "> So far a former coworker of mine and a neighbor have let me borrow their babies for an evening, and both times went really well. \n\nLoaning out a baby like it\u2019s a screwdriver, lol. Probably just worded badly but this sentence threw me off. Hope everything goes well with the rest of the pregnancy and that you guys can keep your dog. Our cats didn\u2019t mind the baby at all and weren\u2019t interested in the slightest.", "Sounds like your family is living and doing all the things it can. I respect your wife for getting help and understanding\n I think you will all be just fine.", "So happy for the update and that things are working out.\n\nI hope you update us again after baby is born to let us know how things are going with mom, baby and Casanova.", "This a positive update all around...\n\n...Except for the part about borrowing babies. You're babysitting. Or taking care of them. Or spending time with them. You're not borrowing. I really hope you're not one of those guys who \"babysits\" his own kids.", "IRL dog trainer here. When I have clients who are pregnant I tell the to teach the dog [Go to your place](https://youtu.be/Z-kvwI_DmHU) and have a place (bed or spot) in every room where they are out of the way BUT can see everything.  He's going to want to keep tabs on everything going on with this fascinating smelly food dropping wonder and if you try to make him stay where he can't he's going to break stay.   \nBasically you want to be able to walk in a room with your hands full of child, give the dog a command and know he won't be underfoot.", "When I was pregnant we took all recommended steps to prepare my doggie too. The last step was bringing baby\u2019s first hat home to let him have her scent so he would know she belonged. Now with my ex husband, myself and my child he was great! Loving and normal\u2026 but let someone else, even a friend walk through my door and he went nuts!!! Very protective! Luckily we were already used to crating him until he settled and realized who was in the house and that they would not hurt us.  You could mention that as being a benefit to keeping your dog too! But I get it, the fear is real, not just for dogs but we also worried about my cats climbing into her crib and smothering her.", "Didn\u2019t read the orig post but I\u2019m glad cuz the thought of rehoming a family pet is heartbreaking. I\u2019m glad you are working through it. My friends mom went through something similar. They had 2 giant rescue wolf/husky hybrids. She was terrified their inner wolf would come out when the baby was born. My friend J was 12 & overhead the conversation about getting rid of her dogs. She packed a bag and ran away with them. Parents finally found her camped in the woods with them the next day. She told them I won\u2019t let u take my dogs. They worked it out & the dogs were so protective of the baby. Her mom was happy she kept them", "I LOLed at \u201clet me borrow their baby\u201d haha.\n\nThis is a great outcome for all though :)", "The \u201cborrow their babies\u201d part has me cackling but this is awesome to hear. Good luck with continuing his training.", "There's also ways to introduce dogs to babies by bringing home clothing that the baby has worn etc for a while before they actually are introduced to the baby itself. It gets them accustomed to the smell and helps them associate the baby as an alpha. Apparently. This a friend told me.", "Loving", "\u201cMy wife thinks the dog is going to eat the baby but I want to show her that\u2019s probably not true\u201d", "My parents had a GSD-collie mix and a GSD-doberman-rottweiler mix when my sister and I were babies. Before I was born they were really nervous about how the dogs would handle it, but it was very similar--they guarded both of us. When my sister was a baby, one of their friends had come over right after they got an above-ground pool and was leaving carrying his rolled up towel in his arms. The collie-shepherd mix saw him, thought the towel was my baby sister, and TACKLED HIM. Didn't hurt him, didn't bite, just held him there until my parents unrolled the towel and showed him that their friend was not actually trying to steal the baby. But he was absolutely NOT going to let anyone get kidnapped on his watch!", "Some people don\u2019t care weirdly lol, a family I met on vacation asked for me to babysit their small children for them that night after we met on the beach around lunch", "She's still living in the same house with the dog, they're just not in the same room as much. Part of correctly done therapy is that the person is only introduced to the frightening thing in the sorts of doses they can handle. /u/TheGreatestGreatDane and his family are handling this well.", "She's working on getting mental health help for her anxiety. She doesn't need a stranger from the internet's advice on how to homemake an episode of fear factor", "I'd love to have heard that convo\n\n\"Hey, mind if we babysit your baby to show my wife that my dog won't injure it?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, absolutely! We've been needing a night out\"", "It's clear you have zero experience with any kind of anxiety. The absolute most important thing here is that she get mental health help, because this anxiety is not ultimately about the dog. If it's dealt with by removing the dog instead of addressed by actual treatment, it's likely something else will just become the source of the anxiety and it will get worse. Pregnancy and postpartum anxiety can be debilitating. OP is doing the exact right thing by urging his wife to get treatment for the anxiety.", "Some dogs just instinctively know about babies anyways. I have a behemoth too hes a Newfie, he has always been more gentle with smaller or more fragile humans than he is with me. When my 2nd baby was born in August we did introductions but kept her out of reach... didn't last long 4.5 months later and the baby squeals with excitement every time she sees him, and he will come give her nose boops (because he knows he's not allowed to lick faces. I hate being licked in the face by dogs so I trained him to only do so with permission). This is the dog who came into my life when my older daughter turned 1. She can walk him and he weighs almost 3-4x what she does. \n\nThe bigger the dog typically the more gentle. I'd be more concerned with a small/medium sized high energy dog than a big guy tbh. Big dogs are the best, in fact I just woke up from a nap with the big guy and the baby (who was in her bassinet).", "My BIL is a doc who was working in the ER, and saw a fairly unpleasant situation where two dachshunds killed a baby. The situation in that home was not great to start with, but I agree, don't underestimate a dog just because they are small.", "It's really impressive you can diagnose a person with postpartum anxiety while they're still pregnant and from a secondhand account. Clearly you have a lot of experience with this.", "When I volunteered at the SPCA, we were taught that they number one dog bite requiring medical care was family terrier biting face of family toddler. Because they're right at eye level and looking a dog straight in the eye is received as an aggressive act.\n\nIt's just as important to teach the child how to treat the dog as it is to teach the dog how not to react.", "That is so sad.", "Dachshunds have a SUPER high prey drive too... Any dog poses a risk to a child/baby tbh. I do controlled interactions between my baby and our dogs. I was the same with my older child. In fact my 5 year old was only allowed to be alone with my dogs in the last year after I was certain she understood dog body language enough to not be at risk of making my dogs feel unsafe or back into a corner (we've worked on how to treat animals and consent since before she could talk back to us). Kids and dogs should not be left unsupervised because its not the dog that is unpredictable, dogs give warning signs and if you aren't watching you can miss them. Its the kids that are unpredictable imo.", "I apologize for slightly mistyping. I meant pregnancy and postpartum anxiety and will edit that in. As this anxiety has showed up absolutely out of the blue at the time in pregnancy when pregnancy anxiety is common it's not some giant leap to say that is the most likely possibility lol. But you do you I guess", "I just find it very odd that everyone is certain the pregnant woman is \"hysterical\" about worrying that this large dog is a threat to her infant. And that my suggestion that it's not irrational to worry about dogs around babies has been so roundly rejected. Everyone wants a nice happy update with NTA and I agreed, that's where we are. But if that woman is uncomfortable with the dog after the baby is born, and the husband assumes he already did his due diligence, I have a feeling he's going to be telling her how it is. I hope I'm wrong.", "This is literally other people with anxiety noticing that this is presenting *just like severe anxiety*. I'm not calling anyone fucking hysterical (but thanks for the random historical sexism), I'm literally drawing on my experiences of years of untreated severe anxiety compared to once I was able to get treatment. Jesus fuck, dude."]}
