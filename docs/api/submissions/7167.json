My wife recently developed a fear of the dog after confirming her pregnancy. She wanted to re-home the dog, either by giving him back to my buddy we originally got him from (as his dog that gave birth to mine has since died) or by finding some other nice family to take him. Obviously, that didn't make any sense, for a number of reasons, but her anxiety was overwhelming her.\n\nWe read some stuff about pregnant women developing sudden fear and hatred towards pets and how common this phenomena is. Several people shared their personal stories on my original post, but I couldn't show her those because I didn't tell her about the original post. There were too many people saying mean things on it. But I found similar stories elsewhere online, and she found them reassuring.\n\nWe've been training the dog on how to be around babies. Well, my son is training him. So far a former coworker of mine and a neighbor have let me borrow their babies for an evening, and both times went really well. So we will continue to enforce appropriate baby behavior with the dog.\n\nMy wife visited her OBGYN to discuss her fear and anxiety, and she again was reassured that many women face similar experiences when pregnant. She is going to start seeing someone to discuss her changing emotional state. She also decided she wants to spend as little time as possible with the dog for now. So we've all been accommodating that, and the dog is now spending the majority of his indoor time in my son's room instead of the living room when my wife is home. So far the dog doesn't mind, as he sleeps in there anyway, and that's where his best friend lives. Our home continues to be harmonious.\n\nI appreciate all the people who provided productive information and outlooks on the last post.", "created_utc": 1673552301, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10a8i7u/update_we_are_preparing_the_dog_for_our_baby_and/", "score": 1356, "replies": ["Saw your first post!

It took her about 30 seconds to decide that protecting the baby was her life\u2019s work. She was 6-7 years old at the time and they became best friends. I think the default setting for dogs is to be gentle around babies. My current dog is so gentle around my grandkids even though I don\u2019t have small kids around.

Animals pick up on how people feel around them, and if your wife starts shunning the dog after your child arrives then that can lead to problems.", "Glad you guys figure it out", "I\u2019m not sure trying to avoid the dog is going to help her overcome it. Maybe some gradual reintroduction therapy?", "My local animal shelter offers classes on how to get dogs used to babies. I haven\u2019t attended but I follow their Facebook page and have friends who have.

Wishing you all the best", "So, a dogs sense of smell is absolutely amazing! They can detect everything from bombs to drugs to chemical changes in a body like insulin level changes, hormonal changes, impending seizure activity, etc, so your dog is more than likely already aware that your wife is pregnant.

My parents had a blue heeler who was their \"firstborn\" and they were worried how she'd react to a baby. Anecdotally, she just sniffed him all over, then parked herself by the cot and was his shadow and bodyguard until the day she died. Never left his side.", "Trusting, or they really needed to get laid. Could be either, not my place to judge. They've also met the dog before and know he is docile.

You negotiated his best friend not getting kicked out!", "That's how Apache is too, he sleeps right next to his bed and wherever the baby is you can find the dog. I was worried so hard because Apache thinks he is a lap dog at 60 lbs and he jumps alot so I didn't want him to jump on the baby. Even now when our son crawls all over him and pets and even gives him kisses, Apache will lay there and just let him do whatever.", "I'm sure he'd refund the babysitting costs.", "Congratulations on your new Golden Angel! They are both the most intelligent and daft dogs, I'm on my second and can't imagine life without them.\n\nMy first was a huge boy, and when we brought our tiny, one month premature daughter home, he took one look and decided she needed looking after! He would always lay as close to her as possible, being so careful not to squash her. Every time we came home from somewhere he couldn't go, he had to check the carrier to make sure we brought her back!\n\nThe only thing he didn't like was when she cried with colic. It was a particularly loud and grating cry, and he just noped right out of the room! He'd go and lay halfway up the stairs, head down with the saddest expression he could muster! \"Sorry Mum, this one is on you!\"\n\nOur daughter is 8 now and climbs all over our current retriever, but she's such a loving and patient dog that she never tries to get away. She just looks at us as though she's confused!", "Well no, but avoiding the dog seems like it\u2019ll make it worse or harder to overcome the problem.

You don't, like, get it.\" I ate so much crow when I grew up. One day, that crow will be my son's, and it will be glorious.", "That's a complete fabrication of your mind. There is literally a mile of distance between the dog actually exhibiting dangerous behaviour towards a child, and the IRRATIONAL PHOBIA of a dog doing a behaviour that it has never ever exhibited to the extreme that you want to get rid of it.\n\nBabies do get disfigured by dogs. They also sometimes get attacked by jealous siblings. Sometimes they get put in danger by post-partum mothers displaying mental health issues. All \"real possible dangers\" by your definition.\n\nAlso if OP had thought he had \"solved\" the issue with getting his wife into therapy, he wouldn't be going to the lengths of acclimatising the dog to babies. Literally by the post, your opinion is disproved. He's taking the sensible precautions. It's you taking a leap of delusion to compare not abandoning an innocent animal to removing a known threat to his children.", "If my pregnant wife was afraid of my dog I would probably prioritize her mental health, whether it rose to your personal bar of being rational or not. I said that it sounded like they found a solution. OP may have figured something out for now, but there are countless stories of dog people keeping the dog at the expense of their partner and child, even when they do run into issues of children being knocked down, nipped, bitten, etc. By the way you're taking this so over the top, I have to assume you are pretty emotionally compromised with this topic and so I won't take your overblown and hyperbolic statements as anything but a lack of common sense and experience.\n\nHow is this an irrational fear, by the way? You're more likely to be injured by a dog than every other animal, combined. Dog bites are a continuous public health issue.\n\n\"Dog bite injuries are common and devastating with an annual incidence of 12.9 per 10,000 persons.1 Children are disproportionately affected compared with adults. It has been estimated that the likelihood of a child sustaining a dog bite in their lifetime is around 50%2 and approximately 80% of severe dog bites in children involve the head and neck.\"\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3820741/", "I don't think the person you're responding to is the one who is emotionally compromised.

I picked a couple of breeds at random for size comparison.", "Yes. And if you have access to multiple practice babies and babies and toddlers at different levels of development, doing this with as many of them as possible and in as many settings as possible will really help doggo remember best. Ex when a dog learns sit they need to learn sit in the living room, sit in the kitchen, sit in the back yard, sit in the park, sit on a walk, sit when greeting a human, sit at PetSmart all mean the exact same thing. \n\nEventually if you could get like idk a few dozen little kids at different ages and smells and settings and energy levels, doggo would be much more reliable about remembering it when their little sibling is born. And with as many kids as you can, practice manners associated with different activities/settings. \n\nAnd kids doing different things - sleeping, crying, diaper change, excited yelling. Kids playing with toys that dogs need to be super good about \"leave it.\" Btw absolutely learn and generalize \"leave it\" and \"stay,\" those and \"come\" are the biggest life saving commands. Leave the baby's toy alone, leave the thing the toddler is offering you bc it isn't dog safe food, leave the baby alone, leave the baby's stuff alone, etc. Zak George's dog training revolution on YouTube has some pretty good training videos on these"]}
