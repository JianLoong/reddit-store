I thought it was just a general interest, but it seems like it's gotten to be more. \n\nI own our house outright. I bought it a few years ago before meeting husband with a combination of savings and the inheritance I got when my grandmother passed. My husband is not on the title. This is important, because a week ago my husband came home with a realor's info. He was going on about getting rid of all our stuff, selling the house, buying a tiny house and some land, everything. He said the realtor would be there for an assessment the next day. \n\nI immediately stopped him and made it clear this was not happening. He did not have my permission to sell the house, he was not getting rid of my things (he can do whatever he wants with his), and I am not living in a tiny house. I'm sure some people love it, like his friends do, but his friend's wives and children are all miserable. They have no privacy, had to get rid of a lot of sentimental items, the kids are always fighting because they're on top of each other - I refuse to do that. I told him I refused. \n\nHe got super pissed off and said he was making the best decision for the family and that I would get used to it. I reminded him that I owned the house, not him, and he could live in a tiny house if he wanted to. I would be comfortable here. More arguing, and he left to go stay with one of his friends. \n\nSome friends agree I'm in the right, that tiny home living isn't for everyone and I would be miserable living like that since I enjoy my space, privacy, and sprawling. Others have said that he can't live his dream without my help, and I'm selfish for not at least giving it a try before shutting it down.

Idk that there is a solution here for both of you, but him demanding he had the right to decide what is best for the family is a huge red flag.

You are not obligated to sell your house and things to fund that venture.", "NTA\n\nIt is VERY FUCKING WEIRD that he arranged everything including setting up an appointment for a realtor to come by the next day without so much as a discussion. Something is seriously wrong here.", "NTA He didn't even have a conversation with you, he just up and decided these things one day. Marriage is about communication and compromise... he skipped a few steps. \n\nAnd you have the right of it - if he wants to go live in a tiny house you're not stopping him. Oh, he can't do that without seeing the house that isn't his? Thats a problem for him to figure out then because he clearly doesn't consider you or your needs when it comes to fulfilling his dreams.\n\nTiny houses are for people who don't have a house and need a cheaper way to access one. Its poverty porn.", "NTA, he shouldn\u2019t assume your stance on major life decisions like selling your house.", "NTA and don't let him force you to sell under any circumstances.\n\nAs this is your sole property, he has not rights to it or the proceeds, but once it is sold, it can get murky.\n\nAlso, tiny house living is lovely, if that is what you want to do.  You obviously don't wish that lifestyle for yourself of children, so you all should not have to endure it.\n\nQuestion?  Did he even consider your children?

The sale of your house isn't happening unless you agree. \n\nI think it was unnecessary to rub his nose in \"I own the house and you don't.\" I own the house my wife and I live in, but I don't remind her of that, it just isn't part of my vocabulary.  \n\n\nI also think it may have been unnecessary and premature to level the \"you can go live in a tiny house by yourself\" line. \n\nThe guy may just be going through a weird phase that will pass if you remain steadfast and silent, but you're using words that are escalating the dispute and pushing this towards divorce.", "NTA.

It's *your* house, for one, and he can't make a unilateral decision like that and just expect you to cave like his friends' wives did. \n\nThank everything that his name isn't on the title.

Sunk cost fallacy prevents many from admitting it.  \n\nThere are ways to try tiny house living without major commitments.  Many people list tiny homes on air bnb. \n\nThe smart way to do it is buy the vacant land first, build, and then sell the main property.   There is a lot of red tape when it comes to converting vacant land into residential property, and there are a lot of laws regarding what features homes must have (sewage hookup, connection to the electrical grid, zoning, minimum square footage, etc). There are also parenting regulations that outline at which age children must have their own bedrooms.   Even if you were on board, he's already putting the cart way before the horse.  He's being super impulsive, no matter how long he's wanted this for.", "NTA but the reason for not moving isn\u2019t that you own the house.  It\u2019s that a decision to significantly hangs lifestyles is a two yes decision.  The actual ownership of the house is irrelevant.", "NTA.  He wants \"his dream\" paid for by you. If he's so hot to live in a tiny house, maybe he could rent one for 6 months.  Alone. And find somewhere to park it, maybe his parents place.  6 months of having to dispose of composting toilet waste should cure him.  I think this goes back to every kid wanting a fort or playhouse.  The reality of living in it 24/7 is quite different.", "NTA. And I bet he's not staying in one of his friend's tiny houses right now... no space for guests.", "NTA.  His \"dream\" shouldn't be at your expense.  If he wants his dream so bad then HE needs to figure out how to make it happen. Selling YOUR house is not the answer.  And tiny house living truly is NOT for everybody.

I guess if you help him pack, you're helping him live his dreams.", "**NTA** and I\u2019m impressed that you stood your ground. \n\nIt would be interesting to see how he feels after a week or 2 of actually living in his friend\u2019s tiny house.", "NTA tiny homes ar for people struggling to make mortgage or rent payments not people who own real houses out right. Tell him to build a tiny house in a garden shed in the back yard and he can live out his dreams\n\nEdit: also in most places since you carried the house into the marriage it will remain yours in case of divorce, if you sell and then re-buy the house is now community property", "NTA.

Or does he think he will sell your house and pocket the money from the sale? What exactly is he trying to achieve here?

If you dig deeper, I won't be surprised if this all comes from resentment he is not on the title of the house.", "NTA But this is more than an \"enthusiasm for living tiny\" problem.  This is a \"he doesn't treat you as a PARTNER\" problem.  If this is regular behavior from him, then he either never saw you as a partner in the first place and hid it well, or he is going through something that he hasn't communicated with you about. To see which one it is, I'd recommend reading the free easy to read ebook link below. It's very easy to understand and you will know for certain,. Then, if it isn't a control issue that he has, then he needs to talk to someone.

We've lived there for several years and while we make it work, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't an absolute f-ing nightmare, at times. We don't have a full kitchen, storage is severely limited and it's next to impossible for us both to move around the space at the same time, without one of us getting in the way of the other, at some point.
