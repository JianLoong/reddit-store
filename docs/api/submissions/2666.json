I thought it was just a general interest, but it seems like it's gotten to be more. \n\nI own our house outright. I bought it a few years ago before meeting husband with a combination of savings and the inheritance I got when my grandmother passed. My husband is not on the title. This is important, because a week ago my husband came home with a realor's info. He was going on about getting rid of all our stuff, selling the house, buying a tiny house and some land, everything. He said the realtor would be there for an assessment the next day. \n\nI immediately stopped him and made it clear this was not happening. He did not have my permission to sell the house, he was not getting rid of my things (he can do whatever he wants with his), and I am not living in a tiny house. I'm sure some people love it, like his friends do, but his friend's wives and children are all miserable. They have no privacy, had to get rid of a lot of sentimental items, the kids are always fighting because they're on top of each other - I refuse to do that. I told him I refused. \n\nHe got super pissed off and said he was making the best decision for the family and that I would get used to it. I reminded him that I owned the house, not him, and he could live in a tiny house if he wanted to. I would be comfortable here. More arguing, and he left to go stay with one of his friends. \n\nSome friends agree I'm in the right, that tiny home living isn't for everyone and I would be miserable living like that since I enjoy my space, privacy, and sprawling.

You obviously don't wish that lifestyle for yourself of children, so you all should not have to endure it.\n\nQuestion?  Did he even consider your children?

If things don't pan out, or there's major delays, at least your family still has adequate housing.\n\nThe smart way to do it is buy the vacant land first, build, and then sell the main property.   There is a lot of red tape when it comes to converting vacant land into residential property, and there are a lot of laws regarding what features homes must have (sewage hookup, connection to the electrical grid, zoning, minimum square footage, etc).

It\u2019s that a decision to significantly hangs lifestyles is a two yes decision.  The actual ownership of the house is irrelevant.", "NTA.  He wants \"his dream\" paid for by you. If he's so hot to live in a tiny house, maybe he could rent one for 6 months.  Alone.

I do think tiny houses are super cute and I love the idea of one, but they're really not designed for long term use (for instance, most of them have a little sleeping loft for the bed that will be accessed by stairs or a ladder: so not accessible for disabled people or elderly people).", "Oh no. 600ft is a small home. Those tiny house things are closer to 100 sq ft", "Basically everything is multi functional and you don't own a lot of stuff. Its good for people that have a nomadic spirit or their tastes run in a more spartan fashion anyway. Its a terrible idea for anyone that needs space and privacy (unless you will be living there alone).", "I really like some of the 400-600 sq ft ones.  But you get down to the ones that are something like 125 and it's like, that's *interesting* and it's neat that some people can do that, but I couldn't.", ">Well, that's the thing, isn't it?  I will concede that there \\*are\\* people who enjoy being outside in all kinds of weather, and good for them, you know?  I could not do it, even if I lived in the most perfect climate.  :D", "You sound awesome dm if you fancy adding on xbox and switch.", "Next time you weed out books, send them my way lol", "Eh I had a bunk bed and I never remember changing the sheets being all that difficult.  To be fair, I was young.", "With escrow etc it\u2019s extremely unlikely for someone to just come home to someone else in their house. But yeah, another reason not to get married for me. I want control over my own life.", "Basement footprint?  Basements are extremely rare where I live.", "Way smaller than 600 sq feet; think 150-200 sq ft.\n\nThey're largely extremely, *extremely* disabled-unfriendly and equally extremely senior-unfriendly. They cost a ton, aren\u2019t even legal in most municipalities, often require you to live way the F out in the boonies due to zoning issues which means you have to drive drive car car *everywhere*, and because of their location they don't always have access to heat, electricity, AC, or water. They almost all feature loft beds and the most incredibly unsafe and unreliable stair systems in human existence to reach loft beds.\n\nThey're basically ego projects for privileged pampered temporarily abled elitist assholes who think they're getting back to nature but who are really one misstep away from a broken back.", "He\u2019s thinking it\u2019s \u201ctrendy\u201d", "Yeah I don\u2019t see how they\u2019re feasible for a family of 4. What the hell is this husband thinking? He doesn\u2019t even own a share of the house!", "Husband might end up living there alone if he keeps this up.", "That\u2019s what I was gonna write but google said 600 lol. But I agree it\u2019s TINY", "Don\u2019t forget that most have only a compost toilet \ud83e\udd22", "Let\u2019s not forget that they\u2019re often not connected to plumbing or electricity, so\u2026composting toilets and owners shower\u2026rarely? IDEK.", "And some of the legal places to park the tiny house can easily be the same as renting a whole ass apartment.\n\nI just saw a video where spots in a Tiny House Village were 800 USD a month. That's more than my rent.\n\nGranted, the village was on a very pretty plot of land, but I live in a big metropolitan city in a walkable neighbourhood a short 15 min walk from downtown.", "I lived in one while on a work assignment in Northern California. Way cheaper than any other housing option I could find, and the person who owned it had it set out on her back 40 so, while I was still in the city and my address was a busy street, I felt like I was in the middle of nowhere. It was great, and I would\u2019ve loved to live there full time. But it was TINY. So tiny that I didn\u2019t have a full kitchen. And in the summertime in California I didn\u2019t need a real stove or oven (I had a microwave and toaster oven and lots of healthy take out options), but if I lived there year round I\u2019d want a little cooktop or something. And there would\u2019ve been no way to house anyone other than me in that space. I didn\u2019t even know whole families attempted the tiny house thing. I\u2019m sure the kids especially hate it.", "I get that it's not for everyone but not everyone is buying one because they want to virtue signal lol. \n\nThey're really cheap to build, much more eco friendly than big houses, and cost little to heat. They make sense for what they are.", "They really aren't. I've seen some tiny house hunting shows where they make space for a few kids, but literally no one ends up having much/any privacy in that scenario. It kind of feels like this guy either Thinks they are trendy/cool and isn't thinking logistics. Or He doesn't like that his wife owns her home and he isn't on the paperwork. Because if they sold it for a tiny home, his name would be on all the paperwork with her, and if they bought something else later he would have his name on that too.", "It's probably fine for one person, maybe two, bit when I see people with kids moving in... that just seems cruel.", "Average size seems to be around 300sq ft. There used to be a show on TV - like house hunters but for tiny homes. It's very tempting to do but the lack of stairs to the loft (or very steep ones) is a concern for a klutz like me and I need space for my books. And I certainly wouldn't want to live with someone else in that small of a space.", "Pretty much like living in a 22 foot trailer with a loft, on a permanent basis.  One person, maybe two, if they are both extra mellow, could make it work.  Resident(s) spend much of their time outside.\n\nIt would certainly be better than living in a teardrop trailer    (inside dimensions 8'L x 5'W x 4'H, with kitchen outside), but it is the same ballpark, IMHO.\n\nI think the suggestion above to buy land and use a tiny house for camping sounds realistic.  Hubby lives a little of his dream, and she lives her dream, which is to live in her house.\n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "The most common are built out of storage sheds", "Composting toilets when done right are not actually bad. But a family of four would need a huge one\u2026 not tiny house friendly", "Your emoticon made me laugh.", "There\u2019s a development of manufactured homes in my area that has cute little houses (not tiny houses)  for really affordable prices. Two bedrooms start at around $45,000 which is dirt cheap, so I went there and took a tour.  But the site fee is $1,000 a month and they can raise that at any time.  And no dogs allowed. So forget it.", "They might make sense for 1 person. But for any more than that they sound like a nightmare. And that one person better be small, healthy, able-bodied, fit, non-claustrophobic, and not mind an uncomfortable bed and barely usable kitchen and bathroom.", "They aren't always that cheap to build. A lot of them cost more per square foot than a normal house.  In fact the average cost of building a tiny home tends to be almost twice as much per square foot.", "They made sense a few years ago, just like living out of a bus or a van made sense.  Now unfortunately the wealthy want to imitate poverty in order to feel something and they drive up the cost for the rest of us.", "Just no. A small house requires much more heating than a decently sized apartment, because all the walls are exterior walls. And because of zoning, it's impossible to legally build a tiny house almost anywhere in the world where there is working public transport, meaning that if you live in a tiny house, you are likely to have to drive almost everywhere.  Very few tiny homes use geothermal heating or other environmentally friendly sources of heat.\n\nTiny houses are straight up dumb. If you want to save the world, move into an apartment.", "Not everything is cheap because they need miniature versions of appliances and furniture, which are specialty items.", "They make no sense, and are just a further attempt to jam more and more people into unlivably cramped and privacy-free environments, just like all modern housing.  The absolute last thing we need right now is more people convinced that a healthy, meaningfull life is possible with 100 square feet and a hotplate.", "In that case he needs couples counseling and not a realtor. This is so ridiculous. I feel bad for OP", "Yeah, and I don't think anyone needs a giant house but proportional to the family.", "There are some families where tiny home or motorhome living works well.  But really only when *everyone* is on board with the idea.\n\nHeck, if you look at homes in other parts of the world like Hong Kong, family living in what to many westerners seems like an unbelievably small space is just normal.  Upbringing makes a big difference in the amount of personal / private space people need/want to feel comfortable :-)"]}
