I bought it a few years ago before meeting husband with a combination of savings and the inheritance I got when my grandmother passed. My husband is not on the title.

You obviously don't wish that lifestyle for yourself of children, so you all should not have to endure it.\n\nQuestion?  Did he even consider your children?

If things don't pan out, or there's major delays, at least your family still has adequate housing.\n\nThe smart way to do it is buy the vacant land first, build, and then sell the main property.   There is a lot of red tape when it comes to converting vacant land into residential property, and there are a lot of laws regarding what features homes must have (sewage hookup, connection to the electrical grid, zoning, minimum square footage, etc). There are also parenting regulations that outline at which age children must have their own bedrooms.   \n\nEven if you were on board, he's already putting the cart way before the horse.

He's a major asshole for trying to force this on you by (poorly) initating the process.", "NTA but the reason for not moving isn\u2019t that you own the house.  It\u2019s that a decision to significantly hangs lifestyles is a two yes decision.  The actual ownership of the house is irrelevant.", "NTA.  He wants \"his dream\" paid for by you. If he's so hot to live in a tiny house, maybe he could rent one for 6 months.  Alone.

We've lived there for several years and while we make it work, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't an absolute f-ing nightmare, at times. We don't have a full kitchen, storage is severely limited and it's next to impossible for us both to move around the space at the same time, without one of us getting in the way of the other, at some point.

For us, price is the deciding factor.)", "Yes this.", "Agreed. I think OP needs to discuss his finances with him and find out his motivation for the tiny house", "Same here! I can\u2019t imagine moving into a tiny house. After I finish work i like to be unsociable and have time by myself, couldn\u2019t imagine having no space to myself in a tiny house. \n\nIf I ever became rich first thing I\u2019d do is build a library in house so I can have unlimited free time to myself \ud83d\ude02", "The husband can literally be in the doghouse, as well as metaphorically.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83c\udf59", "Total win", "I love \"settle his hash.\"", "I mean, that's a far better idea than \"Well, just try it for a while to see if you like it\" like OP's friends are suggesting. If she doesn't like it, then what? She goes back to her house that she no longer has with all her belongings that she also no longer has?", "I vote the husbands share the tiny house, and the wives get the full sized houses.", "Dying at this. Thank you \ud83d\ude02", "IT WILL NEVER DIE!!!!!", "No, tiny living means you have to do your collaborative artwork outdoors.  It's adventurous!", "Yep, I love when the top comment is literally what I was gonna say. Great minds and all that...", "I'd watch that movie", "Is \"pull camper\" American for a caravan?", "I could see a tiny home being great for retirees, a single disabled person or something. A lot easier to do the upkeep and such. But i\u2019d imagine it would be miserable for a family. I couldn\u2019t imagine having small kids and no way to get some peace and quiet, our two bedroom apartment feels like a matchbox when our 7 year old is hyper. And we\u2019ve just got the one lol.", "Some of my friends love the idea and have been looking in to how to do it more over the last few years. But they are all minimalists, they don't like clutter, have very few possessions out of what is necessary and don't even have anything on their walls. I on the other hand could never do it. I utilise every bit of space with various collections, including books and crafts I do. Tiny homes would never be a feasible option for me.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

They need therapy for his communication skills and whatever he is running from mentally.", "Yeah, that\u2019s not a bad idea at all. OP\u2019s husband can build it himself, decorate however he wants. Sounds like a good way to keep everyone happy.", "Thank you for the reply. I appreciate the information you gave me.", "*husband.", "My suspicion is just he wants to have a bunch of money at his disposal and he thought he could convince OP to sell the house that OP owns outright and then split the money from the sale.", "Honestly that makes sense , at least with this man. Ready to sell OP's house and all without even talking about it first.", "That would be a big \"screw you dad\" for me as a hormonal teen, having no private space, or in general feel I have no space to breath in the house becouse the living room Is almost smack in the kitchen.", "Thanks for clearing that up. \nI'm not from America (if that wasn't clear lol) so I'm not familiar with everyday use of phrases etc that might be common or not common. \nMostly when I hear \"for the family\" I think of old mafia movies.

Manufactured/modular homes I am considering have a bonus room and that will be my library/book room", "I also vote for this idea!\n\nAnd i really love your username!", "I always wondered how on earth families can be happy in a tiny house. Singles and young couples I understand but a family with kids? Nah. I remember watching this tv show for a while where the parents wanted a tiny house. The younger kids tended to look at least somewhat excited about it but the older kids mostly hated it: no privacy, no space to yourself, often sharing beds with siblings. I love my sister and we go camping every year but after two weeks of being cramped into a tent I am so happy to have my own space back", "It might be a local term for where I live in the US.   But yes,  a pull camper is like a caravan.  But when we talk about caravans here they are usually larger and have more luxury features.  Where as a pull camper could be one of those tiny things that fits a bed and maybe a little stove.  We also have pop up campers and Trailer Vans", "Americans don\u2019t call them pull campers, but I think I get the meaning. Like a pop up camper or a teardrop camper. Neither of which are comfortable to live in for very long (I tried it).", "A pull camper is one where the bottom is solid and the top pops up and you push beds out. A camper is like a mini house that you pull behind a truck. An RV is a mini house you drive LOL.", "Hopefully soon ex-husband", "That wouldn\u2019t be a slow growth over years. He\u2019s been planning this without his wife for a long time cause \u201che\u2019s the man of the house\u201d and expected her to just go with it even though he knew she didn\u2019t want it. This is not manic. It\u2019s calculated.", "I have seen the word \"caravan\" used in the USA when I lived there, Texas, but vernacular is regional. Here a camper is a van based thing, canonically a VW Transporter, so \"pull camper\" would likely be understood by most and found cute.\n\nPunchline - I have a bona fide American RV here in Scotland.", "Just like a tiny house isn\u2019t comfortable to live in LOL."]}
