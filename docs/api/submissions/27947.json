The day of daughter\u2019s birthday comes, I get her from her bus stop and she wants to stop at her Grammy and papas house on the way home (we live literally 5 houses down from them).

My mother full on gets so upset that she didn\u2019t know it was her birthday, and blames me. \nShe told me it\u2019s my fault because I didn\u2019t tell her the exact day of her birthday, and that she can\u2019t remember all of her grandkids birthdays so it\u2019s my responsibility to tell her ahead of time. Plus she\u2019s been really busy working. I just couldn\u2019t believe that this was an actual thing she\u2019s upset about so I laughed, and told her I thought she knew and she could have asked me.

Keeping a calendar isn't difficult. It's not your responsibility to do this for her. Her final shot, saying you don't care about her? *Shes* the one that forgot your daughter's birthday and then threw a hissy fit on your daughter's birthday instead of handling it with grace and keeping the focus on your daughter. \n\nAnd if it was a week before, or two weeks before that you were discussing birthday parties and she a) didn't already have a gift or b) wasn't prompted by that conversation to get a gift, that's on her.", "Maybe suggest a shared calendar with all important dates you feel comfortable sharing? But regardless she shouldn't expect grace from others when she gives none to others. Focus on your kids' joy and maybe take sometime to reflect. After that time maybe you'd be able to have a conversation about how much this hurt you, and anticipate all outcomes. Good luck, and happy birthday to your kiddo\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nAre they not able to get a calendar and mark peoples birthdays on it?  How many grandkids do they have?\n\nThere is literally no excuse for grandparents who lives so close and are obviously a major part of their grandkids lives to not have any knowledge of when their birthdays are.  Papa is just as guilty as grammy in all of this for not keeping a note of when birthdays are.", "NTA - But your mother sounds stressed. I would keep an eye out for memory issues and note if this behavior is happening with other things. Serious conditions start out small like this. It could explain her anxiety. (It could also be nothing, just offering a different perspective.)\n\nIt\u2019s strange that you both had just talked about it.", "You're NTA. She talked about the daughters birthday before meaning she knew its your daughters birthday soon. If not, she could have just asked. Thats a big overreacting for me, Anyway youre NTA", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s just deflecting her guilt and shame over forgetting, and turning it into anger at you, making out like *you* should feel guilty / ashamed / apologise.\n\nThat\u2019s immature and rude of her.", "In the Netherlands we have birthday calendars.

That should be too early for dementia but it happens.\n\nIs the mother scared (but not admitting it) that she has a potential problem? Is she working longer hours than she can cope with now and so is having memory lapses & is stressed up to the gills? Everyone I know in their 60s was very grateful to reduce their hours at work before they actually retired.

Still in the workforce, an obvious assumption would be that she failed to manage competing priorities.", "My 90 yo gramma managed all of this on an iPad, jus\u2019 sayin\u2019", "Even easier? Have the birthday calendar just be a secondary calendar that gets paired with the otherwise changing yearly calendar for non-birthday appointments and dates.
