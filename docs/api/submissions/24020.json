He\u2019s a great guy but I guess I just wanted more so I broke up with him in May. It was totally not planned but literally on the way home from breaking up with him I met the most amazing guy (Aiden) at Starbucks and it was an instant connection, love at first site, and by the end of the week he had moved into my house and I am still on cloud 9 with him. Isaac thinks because of the timing I was cheating on him and that\u2019s the reason for the breakup\u2014I assure him (and this sub) that I had never met Aiden before.\n\nBecause of this, my friend says I can\u2019t bring Aiden to her wedding.\nIsaac is the best man. it will be distracting enough for me to be there  with the fresh break up, it will be a disaster if I bring the guy which Isaac thinks I was cheating with (again to reassure, I was not). \n\nThere\u2019s a real part of me that thinks everyone needs to get over this. Aiden is in my life and he will always be in my life so people need to get over whatever is bothering them and accept him as they are going to accept me. 10 years ago Isaac met the groom because of me and they became best friends, certainly they can accept Aiden and come to like him in the same way. \n\nMy friend says that she\u2019s been planning the wedding for over a year and while it was certainly my right to break up with Isaac (though she doesn\u2019t agree) I\u2019m not immune from being an asshole for my actions in the wake of it and I need to use some \u201ccoming fucking sense\u201d as she said in her last text to me.\n\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: someone in the comments asked why Isaac was boring and Aiden is exciting. I thought about it for a while and I can\u2019t find the comment but I think it\u2019s a good question so I\u2019ll answer here. When I found out about the Barbie movie I told Isaac I wanted to go see it, his response was \u201cyeah that would be fun, when does it come out?\u201d Like just so vanilla and no discussion or excitement. When I told Aiden I wanted to go the Barbie move 2 weeks ago it launched into an hours long discussion about exploitation, capitalism, the environment, western culture, etc\u2026  after 8 years of Isaac being so \u201cperfect\u201d (and we met in high school mind you) and everyone telling me how lucky I was I just needed something different.\n\nHopefully that answers the question and the poster sees it.", "created_utc": 1691326108, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15jou2i/aita_for_wanting_to_bring_my_boyfriend_as_my_plus/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I believe bringing new partners to weddings is a little strange in the best of circumstances, though there is little that can be said to discourage it. Here you are inviting the romantic rival of the bride's best man, whether you agree that this is the case or not. Nasty scenes happen in weddings. It is not unreasonable for the bride to demand you do your part to prevent one.
