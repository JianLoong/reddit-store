I\u2019m not made of money but I don\u2019t want someone to be thirsty. Today she comes into a room I was working in and said she\u2019s going to take a Pepsi. Didn\u2019t ask me. Just told me. I said I\u2019d rather she didn\u2019t because I only have a few left and I have a long week ahead, and we don\u2019t get paid again until the following week.
