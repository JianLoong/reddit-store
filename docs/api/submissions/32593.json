He has two children with his second wife: 16M and 12F.  \nChristmas is a big deal in my maternal family. We meet at my grandma's place, all my mom's siblings and my cousins, often also other family members that would have otherwise have to spend Christmas alone. Everyone tries to come a few days early to help my grandma with cooking and to stay until after New Year to help with cleaning (and eating the insane amount of food). There's always so much food that my grandma forces everyone to take multiple jars of left-overs when they leave. My grandma grew up in poverty and her life mission seems to be making sure no-one is ever hungry.  \nLast year was the first Christmas since I met my father and they invited me to spend Christmas with them but canceled last moment because my father's wife wanted only her immediate family. It hurt to be turned away a day before Christmas, but my maternal family welcomed me with open arms.  \nMy father's family visits his mother every year on the 25th for a few hours. They still invited me to join them last year and I did. My father's wife decided to stay home last moment. After we finished eating, my paternal grandmother offered seconds to my brother. I wanted some too, but my grandmother said that it's more important that the children eat some. She also offered some to my sister and my father and there was nothing left for me. She also had presents for everyone except for me. I'm okay not getting anything and I didn't starve that one night, but it still hurt. Every time I see her she always has something \"for the children\" and for my father and always leaves me out.  \nSo this year I decided to spend the whole Christmas with my maternal family. He says it's ridiculous and that I'm acting selfish. Even my maternal family says that I should reconsider, because spending time with family over Christmas is more important and that I might regret not getting to know her when I could once she's gone.\n\nI do feel like an asshole because holding a grudge towards a woman in her 70s over Christmas goes against my values, but on the other hand I'd rather put extra effort into making sure that my maternal grandma's Christmas is as good as it can be as long as she's still with us because she's been there for me my whole life.", "created_utc": 1702030790, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18djv60/aita_for_not_wanting_to_visit_my_paternal/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Trust you judgment here. Don't spend time chasing the acceptance of those who aren't interested in opening their arms to you. There'd have to be a seriously incredible reason as to why they never tried to create a relationship during the 18 years it was on them to do so, but it still wouldn't matter now that they have squandered the chance you gave them.\n\nSpend your time with the people you'll miss from your life. Your paternal family is barely a blip on the radar. Don't open yourself to the rejection they're so quick to throw at you.", "Info: you said you didn\u2019t meet your father until you were 18, why was that?", "NTA and I'm so sorry that you've been treated this way.

Enjoy your Christmas elsewhere.", "NTA. Christmas traditions are important to families and it\u2019s completely natural that you would chose to spend this with your maternal side regardless. That being said, I agree with your family that you might regret not getting to know her? At the very least I would make the effort to explain your feelings to your father so that he understands your perspective adequately. If you feel comfortable you might also want to ask your father to arrange more meetings, outside of Christmas, so that you can spend time getting to know one another.", "NTA\n\nIt sucks when people won't respect your feelings. Your relationship with your paternal grandmother doesn't sound like a priority to her and you don't find her treatment of you entertaining; perfectly reasonable. You have nothing to feel guilty about.", "NTA  \n\n\nSpend the holyday with the ones that embrace you, not the stranger ones.  \nit's a invite, not a convocation.  \n\n\nIf them want a relationship, THEM must need to made more effort to build the bridge, instead of setting fire on it and making you fell like is a 'second class grandchild'", "\r  \nNTA, it's understandable that you want to prioritize the warmth and inclusivity of your maternal family's Christmas tradition, especially after feeling excluded during past celebrations with your paternal grandmother.", "NTA. She's not your grandmother, she's made that clear. Your father's wife clearly doesn't want to be near you either. Your father's trying to make this relationship with you into something it isn't. I kind of feel for him, it's something that seems important to him, and nobody else in his family seems interested in making that work.\n\nIf I were you, I'd tell him \"not yet.\" He wants to integrate two branches of his family, and honestly, big family occasions are not the time to do that. Just see him at other times of the year, visit with your grandmother when there's no expectations, and get to know them before you get drawn into these significance -laden occasions.", "I tried getting information about my father and finding him, but I've never managed to. My mom never wanted to talk to me about my father when I was a child and the rest of my family respected her wishes and didn't tell me more about him either. From what I could overhear from other family members, my father only showed up once after the divorce, when I was around 5 years old and disappeared again. Then for as long as I can remember I kept on asking my mom to see my father and she stayed on her position that she'd only take me to meet my paternal grandparents once I turned 18 and she kept her word. By that time my paternal grandfather wasn't alive anymore.", "Thank you for your answer. I have tried asking to meet her more, but she's always busy and is only interested in seeing me if I'm at my father's place when she visits. She then brings sweets and gifts for my half-siblings and asks them about school and life. I have tried to engage more in conversations with her, but she usually says something like \"I'm talking to (my brother or sister) right now\". It feels like I'm only tolerated when I hang around in the background. I'm trying not to let it get to me because she might feel awkward or need more time to get used to having a third grand-child and one that's all grown, but I'm not going to lie, it hurts. I'll try a more direct approach next time I talk to her.", "I\u2019m going to go on a bit of a tangent here but I promise this will relate to your post.\n\nI think it\u2019s important to find out why you weren\u2019t able to see your dad. Make sure to ask both your parents because each of them will give a biased answer. It\u2019s bizarre because if he didn\u2019t want to be around he wouldn\u2019t keep meeting you now. \n\nBut why do this? \n\nBecause understanding why you weren\u2019t able to see him will in turn better understand your paternal family\u2019s mindset. Is it just that they don\u2019t care for you cause your father doesn\u2019t? Or are you unfortunately a victim of circumstance and a reminder of the worst thing that happened to your father. (Not being able to see his son\u2019s childhood). \n\nOP you\u2019re NTA whatever happens and my heart breaks for you. But depending on the answer you are given will greatly affect if your paternal family are TA.", "Thank you for your answer.\n\nI have tried to ask both my parents about the almost 18 years when my father wasn't around. \n\nMy father says that his relationship with my mom is not my business and as I child I wouldn't understand anyway.\n\nWhen I pressed my mom she first said that she doesn't want to poison me against my father and has nothing good to say about him, but that my relationship to him as a father is independent of her relationship to him as a partner.\n\nI got some information from my maternal grandma and she says my father was very egoistical and not a good partner or a good father. My mom's siblings don't know a lot because my mom is the oldest.", "Tough situation all round. Sounds like a bad break up which you\u2019re unfortunately in the middle of. You don\u2019t deserve this OP. I just hope that if you have a kid you won\u2019t subject them to situations like this. \n\nNTA\n\nP.S you\u2019re 19 now and still can\u2019t get an answer as to why you were denied a father from both your parents I wouldn\u2019t bother with either.", "You should spend your Christmas with people who love you, who care about you, and who want you there.

He is saying you're selfish???  \nBecause you want to feel good during Christmas, not being the target of constant malice from his family?   \nWhat's the point you being there? To just seat and see, how everyone is pampered and you're not even allowed to take part in a conversation? OMG...  \n\n\nYour maternal family is strange, too, in this case.  \nFirst they denied you ANY contact with your paternal family, maybe destroying the chance of making a bond with them, and now, suddenly, they're all into keeping contact with abusive grandma? WTF???  \n\n\nBesides, you don't have to hold a grudge towards your paternal grandma. You just can be indifferent. You don't have to think about her, you don't need to have any feelings towards her - she's a stranger to you and you can treat her this way - no bad feelings, but no \"love lost\".   \n\n\nDon't listen to them.  \n\n\nDon't waste your time on the paternal grandma - if your father cares about you and your feelings, he should put some effort, show, that he cares.   \n\n\nYour Christmas was perfectly happy with your mathernal family.

My parents divorced when I was 2 and I lived with my mom, spent my time with her family.  It sounds to me that the attachment you have with your maternal grandmother is very important to you and that's where your heart is.  You have no obligation to make your father happy or to put yourself in hurtful situations.  Be the with family you love, continue to build that relationship.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA.

It\u2019s not the exact same thing but my uncle first met my cousin when she was 24. When she first started being introduced to the family it took a little while for everybody to get to know her & I definitely noticed some weird behavior from my relatives! Happily that\u2019s not the case now but it took time for everybody. I would definitely explain your feelings to your father though. His reaction just seems to me like he doesn\u2019t understand your perspective. Good luck, I hope you and your family have a great Christmas.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt doesn't even sound like they want you there??", "It makes sense you'd feel hurt by this, she's being hurtful!", "I think he's still selfish and egotistical. You already existed when he married the second wife, and now she refuses to spend time with you. Also, what's up with his mom? Why so many gifts? That's weird and IMO she's going out of her way to shoo you out the door. They're not welcoming to you, none of them are."]}
