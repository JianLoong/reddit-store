I would advise you to attend counseling and target the reason that got you anxious in the first place. Try to ask your girlfriend to accompany you so you can improve your mental health and this relationship. \n\nStay strong and humble. Don't look at the past but stride towards the future.", "I can see this being a hot take, but I'm going with YTA.\n\nYou being anxious isn't an emergency. I don't think it's reasonable to get upset at your girlfriend just because she answered a call. It may have taken longer to get off of that call than she meant for any number of reasons. Maybe she just had a hard time getting her sister off the phone.\n\nI think it's worth having a conversation about, in which you can explain to her that in the future, if she's going to call you when your anxious then you want either her complete, undivided attention or to not call. Then you both can decide from there on how to proceed in the future. If she says she's willing to do that and THEN this happens again, i'd side with you.", "NTA. It's normal to expect your partner to be there for you during a difficult moment.", "I don\u2019t expect anything of her really. She asks me how I am and I\u2019m honest in the response. If I\u2019m anxious, she\u2019ll try to support me regardless of how well I\u2019m managing it myself. She\u2019ll set boundaries when she\u2019s not able to do so, and I will also.\n\nAll I expect is if she\u2019s going to say she\u2019s here and have me rely on her for a period rather than on my own coping skills, I\u2019d like for her to be consistent. \n\nI realise I should likely set some boundaries with it.", "The reason I considered it an emergency is because I have PTSD and the anxiety was related to a night terror. Calling her when I wake up can prevent me being caught up in the intrusive thoughts and often prevent flashbacks since her voice grounds me. Her calling and disappearing can kind of exasperate this situation and I\u2019ve explained this before, though not fully in detail. \n\nI think your comment about communicating if she\u2019s going to be here I need her full attention and also discussing how to handle it in the future is a really really great idea. Thank you for this."]}
