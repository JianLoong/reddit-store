People just don't like being pointed out their flaws, EXPECIALLY parenting flaws.\n\nWill add though, regardless of parenting strategies, 15-17 is prime rebelling time anyways. Hell my 10 year old pushes the line when ever possible and I spend all sorts of time with her.", "NTA \n\nUsually meddling isn't a good idea, but clearly you're concered about the girls. Their needs are being put aside for their younger siblings and this could cause worsening problems down the line. \n\nYes, teenagers rebel, but they also need attention and love from their parents.

His daughter\u2019s apparently need someone to advocate for them in that arena.", "NTA. \nHe asked, and got an answer. It\u2019s understandable that it wasn\u2019t what he wanted to hear\u2026. \nBut in my experience as an adult, sometimes we need to hear our mistakes blunt and straightforward like that. Some people take offense to it and get offended, more emotionally mature ones will appreciate that it was wasn\u2019t sugarcoated. \n\nTeens rebel, yes. And parenting doesn\u2019t stop just because they\u2019re older and a new baby came along. I have 3 kids and they\u2019re age difference is huge like this. \nI\u2019ve had to remember to include the older ones in as many things as I can that actually interest then and talk to them like I did before baby came along.", "NTA I'll never understand people that focus on their new partner's kids and gradually forget about their kids.", "NTA. My dad always made certain to spend time with us individually. Each year we each also got a \u201cDaddy Day\u201d, where we got to pick everything for the day, from food to every activity. You don\u2019t forget the time your parents choose to make for you.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s understandable to give babies more attention\u2026 but their not infants anymore & his daughters need attention too. I get he only gives them attention based solely on his own likes\u2026 but he needs to consider the facts that his daughters may not enjoy those things, especially when it\u2019s things that are typically disliked by girls. That\u2019s just common sense.\n\nNo one is asking him to play salon or tea party or something along those lines. However, it\u2019s not gonna kill him to at least sit down & talk with them, take a few hours out of his days to escort his daughters to things they enjoy, treat them to an outing of their choice. Just simple things. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t technically your place to put him in his place, though the moment he opened up to you about it, he did give u reason to so. \n\nIf he likes the outdoors so much & wants to compromise, perhaps the girls would like to go riding\u2026 they can talk & ride & it would be fun & a n experience they can share.", "NTA for wanting to help, but YTA for the way you told your BIL that he was screwing up.   \n\n\nProbably would've been better to ask him if he bothered to ask/talk to the teens about what's going on to see if they'd just tell him about their own frustrations. Especially since they told you straight up that they're frustrated.", "YTA. I'm sure you were trying to help but telling someone they are doing something wrong with their kids is never the way to go. You may be 100% correct but he isn't going to hear it. The better way to approach it is by providing advice if it is asked for but never using accusatory language when you are doing it. If they are truly open to advice then they might hear it. Just because the girls tell you that's the reason they are rebelling doesn't necessarily mean that is the case. Teens rebel, it just happens. It is a natural course of life and should be handled delicately.", "Look, I gotta say ... my parents were loving, decent, involved parents. And I was rebellious AF. There's just not enough info here to make a determination. Maybe the girls are rebelling because there's something wrong in the household. Maybe they're rebelling because they're rebelling.", "NTA. Hopefully he just wasn't in a state of mind to hear it then? He probably felt attacked too. If I were you I would try to speak to him again and mention that you're not judging - you're coming from a place of caring. Mention to him what his daughters have told you and maybe the two of you could come up with a list of activities to present to the girls to see if they're interested in any of them?\n\nETA: Have him ask his girls what they would be interested in doing too.", "I honesty don't bueve in being gentle to parents especially when it effects those I care about. I understand they rebel in general but it's clear they need so real attention", "He's very rural minded so his hobbies are basically hockey, beer, 90s rock and stuff bbq and 4 wheeling.\n\nThe oldest daughter will get some joy from playing around on the 4 wheeler with the boys but the youngest daughter is very introverted and she doesn't care for rural/rednecky stuff like camping and 4 wheeling.\n\nI honesty can't remember the last time he did something on their level that didn't involve the kids or camping", "He's not going to hear it in general because he thinks that stubbornness is a cute personality trait. I know that teens rebel but it's clear that they need  attention on their level that isn't what the parents want to do or revolve around the kids ex. Babysitting", "Agree 100%.", "Look I'm saying this as someone who studied interpersonal communication and used to say just what you did regarding being gentle. \n\nBut the fact is your chosen method caused him to shut down. It didn't have the outcome you wanted. \n\nWhereas a bit of tact would have had him actually listen to you. Something like \"So you feel they're rebelling but when was the last time you did stuff with them that wasn't catering to their younger siblings?\" And then thinking of some ideas for stuff to do your older niblings like. \n\n\nI don't think you're an asshole, but I don't think your chosen method of approach is going to get you what you want.", "That is so hard. I was the oldest in my family and all of my cousins and siblings were years younger. I was always the one stuck with the babysitting chores and never got to do some family activities because I was the built in babysitter. I don't blame the girls for rebelling. And I do agree that he needs to spend more time with them. I just know that parents usually shut down and resent when people tell them they are wrong in how they are raising their kids.", "I do get that parents get resentful when they're td they're wrong but I believe in addressing issues and I don't care about stuff like \"parent shaming\" I care about the girls more than their feelings", "Fair enough. I respect your choice and I hope things get better for them.", "NTA.\n\nYour niece has told you how they feel. He was venting to you about their behavior. You responded. But, you weren't just responding as an observer. You were giving him advice based on the actual feelings of his daughters.\n\nIt wasn't even harsh advice. It's pretty basic advice for engaging with a teen. \"Spend time with them that involves *their* interests.\"\n\nWith young kids, you can get away with involving them in your activities and interests (to a degree). But that doesn't work with teens if your interests aren't their interests.\n\nMy guess is that he reacted as he did because he wasn't looking for advice, but rather validation. That he was looking to hear \"yeah, man, teens are all James Dean wannabes in hoodies\". What he got was not comisseration, or suggestions on how to \"fix\" his daughters, but advice on changing himself.\n\n(side note: I don't agree with the 'all teens rebel' attitude. Teens are learning independence. Which they need to learn and takes time. Can it involve pushing boundaries, sometimes even too far? Sure. But a lot of teen 'rebellion' could be avoided by treating them with respect and courtesy and meeting them where they're at.)\n\nCould the way you have said it been tailored differently? Possibly. Hard to say without actually hearing it being said.\n\nBut, knowing what you know of the situation, it sounds like you would have been doing a disservice to him and them to not tell him that he needs to start with himself.\n\nOne thought on where to go from here... You've told him to connect with them through their interests. Maybe the next step is to help him experience it.\n\nFigure out something that your nieces would be interested in doing and invite the three of them to do it with you. No GF, no younger brothers. Just dad, daughters and uncle.\n\nIt might be the opportunity he needs to see that he can connect with them without it all being about him.", "But what if other people have tried before? He can be difficult to talk to because he thinks that being very stubborn is a cute personality trait.  I refuse to waste my time with stubbornness", ">But the fact is your chosen method caused him to shut down. It didn't have the outcome you wanted.\n\nThat simple fact holds true in about 90% of comments, online or otherwise.", "That's fair enough. You know the guy I don't lol. I definitely don't think people are required to give endless patience when someone is routinely thick headed. \n\nI'm mostly just glad that your nibblings feel comfortable enough to talk to you at least.", "If other people have tried and failed, what use is tossing your hat into the mix doing?", "Tbh I wouldn't have said that if I knew the brother is the type to be proud he's stubborn and doesn't listen.", "Because I care", "Yeah I too wrote a fucking book worth of words prior to that.\n\nHonestly, if my sister/brother was 'too stubborn and doesn't listen' then I would just keep it to myself. Knowing the above, what good would any advice do other then enflaming tensions between siblings.", "I'm just pointing out the fallacy of that statement. If notifying him does nothing as he's too stubborn, what does it accomplish?\n\nI understand you care and wish things were better. Weigh the negatives and positives here on this confrontational stance. \n\nNegative: Inflames your relationship, results in zero change, doesn't improve the situation.\n\nPositive: Makes you feel better having stated your opinion.\n\nIn lieu of that information, wouldn't either being silent or waiting for the correct moment yield more positive results? Got to ask yourself, are you doing it for the kid or for yourself. If it's the former, then you need to go about it in a more productive way.", "NTA", "NTA. They likely need connection.", "NTA", "NTA. Parents hate being confronted with their shitty parenting."]}
