People just don't like being pointed out their flaws, EXPECIALLY parenting flaws.\n\nWill add though, regardless of parenting strategies, 15-17 is prime rebelling time anyways. Hell my 10 year old pushes the line when ever possible and I spend all sorts of time with her.", "NTA \n\nUsually meddling isn't a good idea, but clearly you're concered about the girls. Their needs are being put aside for their younger siblings and this could cause worsening problems down the line. \n\nYes, teenagers rebel, but they also need attention and love from their parents. You've pointed out the issue, now it's time to let their parents process and hopefully change accordingly.", "NTA he definitely needed to hear it.", "NTA-if he didn't want advice he probably shouldn't have been complaining to you about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His daughter\u2019s apparently need someone to advocate for them in that arena.", "NTA. \nHe asked, and got an answer. It\u2019s understandable that it wasn\u2019t what he wanted to hear\u2026. \nBut in my experience as an adult, sometimes we need to hear our mistakes blunt and straightforward like that. Some people take offense to it and get offended, more emotionally mature ones will appreciate that it was wasn\u2019t sugarcoated. \n\nTeens rebel, yes. And parenting doesn\u2019t stop just because they\u2019re older and a new baby came along. I have 3 kids and they\u2019re age difference is huge like this. \nI\u2019ve had to remember to include them is many things and talk to them and do things they wanna\n do.", "NTA I'll never understand people that focus on their new partner's kids and gradually forget about their kids.", "NTA. My dad always made certain to spend time with us individually. Each year we each also got a \u201cDaddy Day\u201d, where we got to pick everything for the day, from food to every activity. You don\u2019t forget the time your parents choose to make for you.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s understandable to give babies more attention\u2026 but their not infants anymore & his daughters need attention too. I get he only gives them attention based solely on his own likes\u2026 but he needs to consider the facts that his daughters may not enjoy those things, especially when it\u2019s things that are typically disliked by girls. That\u2019s just common sense.\n\nNo one is asking him to play salon or tea party or something along those lines. However, it\u2019s not gonna kill him to at least sit down & talk with them, take a few hours out of his days to escort his daughters to things they enjoy, treat them to an outing of their choice. Just simple things. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t technically your place to put him in his place, though the moment he opened up to you about it, he did give u reason to so. \n\nIf he likes the outdoors so much & wants to compromise, perhaps the girls would like to go riding\u2026 they can talk & ride & it would be fun & a n experience they can share.", "NTA for wanting to help, but YTA for the way you told your BIL that he was screwing up.   \n\n\nProbably would've been better to ask him if he bothered to ask/talk to the teens about what's going on to see if they'd just tell him about their own frustrations. Especially since they told you straight up that they're frustrated.", "YTA. I'm sure you were trying to help but telling someone they are doing something wrong with their kids is never the way to go. You may be 100% correct but he isn't going to hear it. The better way to approach it is by providing advice if it is asked for but never using accusatory language when you are doing it. If they are truly open to advice then they might hear it. Just because the girls tell you that's the reason they are rebelling doesn't necessarily mean that is the case. Teens rebel, it just happens. It is a natural course of life and should be handled delicately.", "Look, I gotta say ... my parents were loving, decent, involved parents. And I was rebellious AF. There's just not enough info here to make a determination. Maybe the girls are rebelling because there's something wrong in the household. Maybe they're rebelling because they're rebelling.", "NTA. Hopefully he just wasn't in a state of mind to hear it then? He probably felt attacked too. If I were you I would try to speak to him again and mention that you're not judging - you're coming from a place of caring. Mention to him what his daughters have told you and maybe the two of you could come up with a list of activities to present to the girls to see if they're interested in any of them?\n\nETA: Have him ask his girls what they would be interested in doing too.", "I honesty don't bueve in being gentle to parents especially when it effects those I care about. I understand they rebel in general but it's clear they need so real attention", "He's very rural minded so his hobbies are basically hockey, beer, 90s rock and stuff bbq and 4 wheeling.\n\nThe oldest daughter will get some joy from playing around on the 4 wheeler with the boys but the youngest daughter is very introverted and she doesn't care for rural/rednecky stuff like camping and 4 wheeling.\n\nI honesty can't remember the last time he did something on their level that didn't involve the kids or camping", "He's not going to hear it in general because he thinks that stubbornness is a cute personality trait. I know that teens rebel but it's clear that they need  attention on their level that isn't what the parents want to do or revolve around the kids ex. Babysitting", "Agree 100%.", "Look I'm saying this as someone who studied interpersonal communication and used to say just what you did regarding being gentle. \n\nBut the fact is your chosen method caused him to shut down. It didn't have the outcome you wanted. \n\nWhereas a bit of tact would have had him actually listen to you. Something like \"So you feel they're rebelling but when was the last time you did stuff with them that wasn't catering to their younger siblings?\" And then thinking of some ideas for stuff to do your older niblings like. \n\n\nI don't think you're an asshole, but I don't think your chosen method of approach is going to get you what you want.", "That is so hard. I was the oldest in my family and all of my cousins and siblings were years younger. I was always the one stuck with the babysitting chores and never got to do some family activities because I was the built in babysitter. I don't blame the girls for rebelling. And I do agree that he needs to spend more time with them. I just know that parents usually shut down and resent when people tell them they are wrong in how they are raising their kids.", "I do get that parents get resentful when they're td they're wrong but I believe in addressing issues and I don't care about stuff like \"parent shaming\" I care about the girls more than their feelings", "Fair enough. I respect your choice and I hope things get better for them."]}
