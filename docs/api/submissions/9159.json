It\u2019s kind of harsh, but they aren\u2019t respecting or appreciating your home. Damaging your clothes doesn\u2019t sound like an accident either.

If they're creating mayhem in your house and choose to act like selfless shits, then they are not entitled to come into your house. Your house, your rules.", "NTA. You were kind to give her a place to stay but obviously you haven't been around little kids too much and their actions were not meshing with your lifestyle.", "NTA\n\nYou have a right to be comfortable in your own home and not have your things destroyed.\n\nThe friend should be thankful.

At the age of 4 and 5 wouldn't be aware of the situation and can't be humble.  BUT, it is up to her, as their mother to teach them respect.\n\nBut I do have a question, why was your best piece of clothing on the floor to be trodden on?", "NTA! Your friend needs to have better control of her kids if they\u2019re ruining things. Did you friend offer to replace or repair the item once she\u2019s back on her feet?", "NTA.  If they were able to do that to your clothes, it was only the first of many items they would\u2019ve destroyed.  She wasn\u2019t watching them properly.", "NTA. They need to respect your home and everything in it. I get that they\u2019re kids but they\u2019re old enough to know that they shouldn\u2019t destroy something that doesn\u2019t belong to them. Where is the mom in all this? She should be watching her kids", "NTA. Those kids are still pretty young, so they won't understand how to be \"humble\", but you also don't owe them anything. It's your house and your space; you're not obligated to share it. They aren't your responsibility.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2018s your house, above all.

Or did you give them a couple of other weeks to find other arrangements? Or, if you kicked them out immediately, did they have a place to go and you knew they had a place to go? \n\nYou're not under an obligation to house them, but if you agreed to house them and then abruptly left a mother with two children, one of whom is disabled, homeless with no warning because a kid ripped your dress, you are absolutely an asshole.

He told me he was going to see me on my birthday, and then told me \"oh, actually I've had these plans on your birthday since before I even met you. I don't know why I said that.\" He also forgot my birthday, and so much more. After explaining all of that, it felt justified to the other person, but beforehand it just seemed like I was overreacting.", "YTA\n\nListen, you get to decide if you want to help out a friend in need. You certainly weren't required to take her in or help her out in the first place. However, you did agree to assist her. You were well aware of her kids when you did so. Did you set a boundary on time for this assistance? Did you talk about realistic expectations regarding her kids behavior? It seems very cruel to abruptly kick out a person who is struggling over a piece of ripped clothing. At age 4 and 5, accidents will happen. Young kids are never \"humble\" and that's a strange expectation.", "[deleted]", "YTA. You offered to help, knowing full well that she had kids. Even the most well adjusted 4 and 5 yo will break things and certainly won\u2019t have enough awareness to realise that they should go around acting humble and grateful all the time. And if you let her live in your house with her children I assume since she is your friend that they also interact with you. And now, because they have acted like perfectly normal children, i.e. being bratty and breaking things, you have decided to take away another place they thought of as their home and also severed a relationship with someone (you) they probably considered to be safe and friendly. So yeah.", "So the 4yo and 5yo have lost their home and are staying with a stranger and you expect them to be...humble???

How to act like a guest would be cued from the childrens mom.  \n\nEspecially with the age of the children, teaching the children by saying things like, \"we're a guest in this house, we need to do x, y, z\" would go a long way.  The mom should be taking a more active role in getting her children to understand their situation.  Sure, kids are going to misbehave, but hearing the mom at least trying to teach them goes a long way to understanding.  \n\nReminds me of the neighbors I have that ignore their dogs constant barking.  Children and dogs both need correction, they're works in progress.  \n\nNTA", "But you do have a right, in your own home to be comfortable.  And these kids aren't making your comfortable.

I hope she finds a better situation. Good on you for trying.", "This sub is not r/AmIObligated.

Not great. I feel like the punishment is extremely harsh given the crime and perpetrator. There is 50% chance she put a family out on their ass because a special needs 5 year old absentmindedly ripped a blouse", "Basically, I just feel like there's a lot of missing context.

Why would you ever think you are when their disrespecting you and your property?  Her children's issues are not your responsibility to bear.\n\nShe chose her actions and now needs to pay the price for them.
