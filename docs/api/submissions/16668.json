Life happens and doesn\u2019t stop for a wedding. Your not drinking likely was going to have people talking and possibly asking you if you are pregnant. Some people can look at you and just know.

Three weeks is a LOOOOOONG time between a pregnancy announcement and a wedding.", "NTA. I\u2019m guessing her told his fianc\u00e9 and she\u2019s the one who\u2019s pissed. They get a day for their wedding, not like a whole month. 3 weeks is definitely long enough time to make an announcement like that. \n\nCongratulations!!!", "NTA.

Yikes OP, I am so sorry you have to deal with this tomfoolery instead of getting to be excited about your life changing news.  It's baffling to me that they can't get past their own selfishness to let you be excited about something you've wanted and didn't think you'd be able to achieve. Three weeks is a pretty long time and it's probable that even if you'd told everyone sooner, they'd still be talking to you about the pregnancy at the wedding.  People take interest in that kind of thing.  But that doesn't mean your pregnancy is more important than their wedding.  My SIL is very competitive/ wants all attention on her so I empathize deeply with the nonsense you're experiencing. Hopefully with time she'll realize she's being foolish. I'm sure your brother is just trying to take his soon to be bride's side to make her happy", "NTA.

Probably insecure or entitled as heck.", "I announced 4 weeks before my brother\u2019s wedding. My SIL was ecstatic (we asked her to be the godmother) and took a picture day of her wedding with the bump. \n\nI think it all depends on the person. We didn\u2019t announce before my BIL\u2019s wedding because we were only 8 weeks, but my MIL knew because I got \u201cmorning\u201d sickness during the reception and she and my husband\u2019s aunt walked into the bathroom during it. They were good and didn\u2019t tell anyone until the reception was over. My BIL and SIL were then disappointed they didn\u2019t know (but not angry or truly even upset by any means). \n\nSome people are weird about sharing the spot light. Maybe your future SIL feels like an outsider or something already. Maybe she\u2019s a bridezilla. Maybe she made an offhand comment and your brother blew it out of proportion.  \n\nAt this point, wear something that doesn\u2019t super accentuate the bump, don\u2019t take any photos with your hands on the belly in an obvious way during the reception, and move on.

Not tryna sound an ass myself, but true family wouldn\u2019t get pissed at minimal shit like that. Not saying ur pregnancy announcement is a small topic, but it\u2019s not like u went out of ur way to announce it at his wedding, which then I could find his reasoning valid as to why he\u2019d be pissed.

Like, I'm not sitting around after dinner talking solely talking about the bride/groom/wedding. People are going to congratulate you and eventually move on to other topics of conversation.  I've never met a person who went running to the bride to talk about something big in someone else life and \"upstage\" the wedding.

OP should say to brother she's not going to attend lest anyone be distracted by her presence.

Your exciting news is worthy of sharing.", "NTA.  I suspect brother was fine with it until he told his fiance' and she threw a fit.  You have a bride-to-be who wants all attention on her.

And even if you didn't (which I'm sure you wouldn't do anyway), how long would you be expected to wait before putting in on Facebook so that it didn't upstage their wedding? \n\nCongratulations on the pregnancy!", "NTA.\n\nIt's very strange. It could be a cultural difference thing but where I came from, the more good news, the better e.g., pregnancy, marriage, promotion, kids accepted into a prestigious uni that they craved for, etc. Everyone would be happy for each other.\n\nWe don't have this notion where one good news could probably outshine the other and so must avoid revealing to family members the former good news.\n\nTo put it bluntly, it's like me saying \"Only I deserved to have good things happening to me during this day or week or month, no one else can.\" Pretty selfish thinking, isn't it?", "NTA. The wedding is 3 weeks away, not 3 days. The world isn't going to stop just because they have an event coming up and announcing your pregnancy nearly a month in advance of their wedding is plenty of time for people to get their excitement out before the event. (Honestly, as you noted, posting it on FB might have been better because that lets relatives/friends you don't see as often find out earlier rather than at the wedding.)\n\nTell your brother to get over himself. It's understandable to be stressed, but he shouldn't take his or his fiancee's feelings out on you. Thanks to you making the announcement when you did, three weeks from now it'll be \"old news\" and everyone will be thinking about his marriage since, you know, it'll be happening at that moment. So, he should focus on that and leave you be. \n\nCongrats on your upcoming kid. When your brother realizes he was being an AH and starts to feel bad, be sure you leverage that for as many diapers as you can get him to buy.", "NTA\n\nI kinda was in the same predicament as I had finally hit that 12 week mark a month before my sister's wedding.\n\n I told my sister at the 5 week mark partially because I didn't want to have to come up with reasons for why I wouldn't be drinking or ATV riding on her Bachelorette but I did end up asking her later if she was okay with people finding out so close to her wedding. Thankfully for me she was ecstatic and excited for me to finally announce it but also like.... I don't think she would have any real right to ban me from it if she wasn't. \n\nThis isn't like you're announcing it at their rehearsal dinner or something. It's almost a month before the event after waiting to hit a specific milestone. Don't feel bad.", "NTA\n\nI don't get why people get so upset about stuff like this. His wedding is ONE day. He doesn't get to make everyone put their lives on hold for months  before and after. 3 weeks is more than enough time. The world doesn't revolve around your brother just because he is getting married. \n\nIt's better to announce it before the wedding rather than having people find out during the reception or something. That would be bad.", "NTA", "NTA. The idea that the entire world has to stop within a month on either side of someone\u2019s wedding is absolutely ridiculous. Happiness isn\u2019t a zero sum game- people can be excited for you and your brother at the same time, and if he can\u2019t wrap his mind around that, that\u2019s his problem. In three weeks everyone will be used to your news and refocused in his.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s entirely reasonable protocol to not make big announcements on the *actual day of* a wedding but that\u2019s where it ends. \n\nThis idea that when 2 people get married everyone else\u2019s life has to stop happening for months either side, and no one else in the world should matter, is ridiculous and selfish. \n\nAre they expecting that people at the wedding should not be allowed to talk about anything or anyone else except the couple? Like if someone says \u201ccongratulations on your pregnancy\u201d to you or \u201chey how\u2019s the new job going?\u201d to uncle Jim or \u201chave you picked a major yet?\u201d to cousin Penny, it\u2019s some terrible infraction that siphons some of the precious, precious attention away from the bride? \n\nYou\u2019ve tried to reach out and resolve this with your brother, which is good, but if it was me I\u2019d just drop it now. This is a childish tantrum and I don\u2019t recommend giving it any more oxygen by continuing to engage with it.", "NTA! Three weeks prior to a wedding? His partner sounds jealous. People are weird", "Nta. You are 12 weeks, when else were you supposed to announce it? At the wedding? Were you supposed to wait till 3 weeks after? \n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy,  may the most difficult thing you have to deal with be what kind of icecream to eat.", "NTA. if you showed up and didn't drink the champagne and someone noticed, it would cause a FAR BIGGER stir than telling people three weeks before. Could you imagine everyone at the wedding gossiping about how they *think* you're pregnant, and THEN the bride found out that way? She would have thrown a fit.", "NTA you announced it 3 weeks before, to me that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not like you announced it that morning. You were in a no win situation. If you had not announced it and someone had worked it out at the wedding because you weren\u2019t drinking he would have been moody and if you had announced it straight after they would have said you were one upping them.\n\nPeople need to learn they get a wedding day. They can\u2019t block out a month where everyone they know has to prioritise their wedding over their own lives.", "NTA. It\u2019s better to announce it before (and even 3 weeks before!) so by the time the wedding comes it\u2019s not a surprise to anyone and everyone can focus on the event at hand.", "3 weeks isn't a issue, either his soon to be wife or he is a bridezilla and congratulations", "NTA - I was expecting when you said \"right before\" that it was the morning of the wedding. It's three weeks to go, did they expect you to wait to week 15 to tell everyone - not very practical.", "I am so sick of people acting like their weddings even matter to anyone but the couple themselves. \n\nThis bullshit is getting out of hand. \n\nNTA", "I am increasingly perplexed as to how peoples wedding days have become a stage-managed giant pain in the ass to anyone except the bride & groom. If you\u2019re a guest or wedding party you could be asked or told\n1) there will be a steadily increasing number of \u2018parties\u2019 for which everyone invited has to pay handsomely, including paying for the bride & or groom.\n2) along with paying for parties there will be the expectation of buying an expensive gift from the registry AND give money to the happy couple.\n3) women in particular will be instructed not to cut or dye their hair or told the opposite, told not to get pregnant & if they are, expected not to tell anyone, told to loose weight, not wear makeup or do wear makeup, cover their tatts, wear low shoes as the bride is short etc etc \nMyself and a bridesmaid were quite heavily pregnant at a friends wedding years ago. In fact the bridesmaid really looked like she could pop any day. No one paid more attention to us than the bride and groom. A friend of mine was pregnant with her first child at my wedding and I was thrilled to be able to tell everyone. There was even a very young baby, too young not to bring as he was breastfed, and I danced with him too. no one forgot it was my wedding, no one spent more time with the pregnancy lady or cooing over the baby. It was a lovely day with my nearest & dearest. Everyone just needs to calm down about weddings.", "These are people who claim birthday months", "I wonder, is this a Western thing? I'm African. This issue of \"taking the attention from the main couple\" that I keep seeing on Reddit has always left me bewildered. Because where I'm from, sharing the spotlight with someone (even on the wedding day) for a few minutes is absolutely normal. I've been to plenty of weddings where a man would propose to his lady in front of everyone. Of course it's done with the couple's permission; and instead of looking at it as a \"theft of spotlight\" we consider it like a bonus, a memorable event where two other people in love can look back on and remember it with fondness. A sense of community. We all cheer, express our congratulations and then quickly move on back to the star couple of the day. \n\nSome tribes actually wear the same colour codes. So the bride ensures to mention her colours and themes on the invitations and you can be sure 99% of the people, especially the couple's  family, will wear a variation of that colour code and theme. So imagine almost everyone blending along with the room decor \ud83d\ude05.\n\nThe one unwritten rule we do have is that no one should wear the same colour as the bride. That's our way of letting her stand out and shine. But engagement and preganancy announcements on the wedding day, that's such a non-issue to us if and when it happens. So to me, OP making that announcement WEEKS before the wedding day...NTA", "Yes! It absolutely would've been more disruptive to have it be guessed or construed at the event itself.", "NTA what is it with these people who think their wedding is the most important thing in everyone else's life.\nYour brother doesn't own the months or weeks before or after his wedding. How self absorb one must be to think that no one else is allowed to share news around the time of their wedding.\nYou are not sharing the news at his wedding.\nHonestly, this is your future SIL talking. How insecure she must be.", "NTA. How dare he get married just after you announce your pregnancy?! /s \u2026see how silly that sounds??\n\nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong and they need to get over themselves.

You were actually being really considerate!", "I mean you could have waited until after the wedding so yes maybe TA.", "American weddings have become insufferably narcissistic.", "NAH. You did nothing wrong and there is nothing wrong with your brother being a bit pissed off. Just talk to him and make good. And try to avoid too much. Any talk at the wedding.", "NTA.

It\u2019s all very innocent but vindictive and mean at the same time. Just know if you do those things at their wedding all night you will be bringing attention to yourself (the pregnancy) and everything your brother said was right.
