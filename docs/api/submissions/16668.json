It has been 12 weeks of excitement, and nausea, and impatiently waiting to tell my parents. My husband and I are ecstatic, we've been trying to get pregnant for almost a year and it was starting to feel like it wouldn't happen. We had a pregnancy loss in the past, so we decided to wait the whole 12 weeks to announce.\n\nThe day came, all check ups were good, and I could tell my mum. It was great, she cried, I cried, we all cried. I felt absolutely blissful (and mostly still do). After my parents, his parents, both sets of grandparents etc.  I called my brother (33M), he was really happy for us, really happy that his kids would get cousins, we talked on the phone for an hour. We joked about the fact I wouldn't be able to drink at his upcoming wedding which is three weeks away.\n\nThis is where I might of fucked up? The day after, I posted it to Facebook. We visited or called anyone who we wanted to tell personally and Facebook was an after-thought.\n\nThe next day my mum calls me really upset, apparently my brother had called her and had ranted about the fact that we announced the pregnancy 'right before' his wedding. That their whole wedding would now be about me being pregnant, and I would steal the attention from his fiance. He was specifically pissed that I put it on Facebook.\n\nIt's been a couple of days and apparently he's still pissed. I tried calling him and he wouldn't answer me. Should I just let it go and see if he calms down? Maybe my mum shouldn't have repeated what he said since he was just venting; but he upset her quite a lot, she's not the appropriate person to vent to in this situation.\n\nMostly, is three weeks an appropriate time away from the wedding?

He is probably getting an ear full from your future sister-in-law. He probably was fine with it!!", "NTA. Despite what some bridezillas (and groomzillas) seem to think, the happy couple doesn\u2019t get to \u201cown\u201d weeks or even months of the calendar in which no one else is allowed to have life events. \n\nThey get to be the center of attention on their wedding day, and that\u2019s all. ONE DAY.", "NTA. He\u2019s worried about all the people who (a) weren\u2019t already told by you AND (b) are FB friends with you *and* your brother AND (c) will be attending the wedding?? That has got to be a tiny number. It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nNot to mention it\u2019s just more joy at the wedding; not a competition about what\u2019s more important.", "NTA. He\u2019s acting like you announced it at his wedding ceremony", "NTA. 3 weeks is far enough. People would have gotten their congratulations out of the way by then. Therefore the wedding would be all about the bride and groom. And not about why you are not drinking. Because that would have been the conversation at the wedding if you didn't tell anyone. So you actually did him a favor. I personally think that it is the bride that is making a big deal - maybe it is stress or she is being a bridezilla. I think this because he wasn't bother in the original call when you told him. So give them space and try to wear a dress that doesn't play up your pregnancy at the wedding.", "NTA. Three weeks is plenty of time. It\u2019s not like everyone was going to be able to keep it a secret for that long. Just make sure to try and deflect focus back to your brother during his wedding weekend and you\u2019re good to go", "NTA - I don\u2019t understand why people feel \u201cupstaged\u201d by stuff like that.", "NTA. I don't think you need to apologize. It's three WEEKS. It's not like you announced it the day before.", "NTA\n\nOh my. How dare you announce your pregnancy on your own social media within a month of your brother & SIL getting married. {sarcasm}\n\nJust because brother & SIL are getting married doesn\u2019t mean no one else is allowed to announce their own good news. It\u2019s not like you did it at the bridal shower, the bachelorette party, or the wedding. WTF", "NTA. Three weeks is not right before.  Three days is.  Hopefully, your brother will get over being sore about it.\n\nAnd congratulations and get all the sleep you can now.", "NTA You're not trying to steal the light from the wedding it's three weeks away. The week of would have been a different story. Like others said just deflect the attention and try and point it at the bride and groom all should be fine.", "NTA.  3 weeks before the wedding is plenty of time!!  My guess is the brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is the one that has the issue with the announcement. Doesn\u2019t want any focus taken away from her.", "NTA. Like others have said three weeks is plenty of time. I'm sure that while people will congratulate you in person, his wedding will still be about him.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThey have a wedding day. Not a wedding month. The wedding invitation doesn\u2019t impose some sort of life event announcement embargo on you until after the wedding is done.\n\nIf you\u2019d kept it on the downlow but then worn a loose-fitting dress to the wedding while drinking water all night, they\u2019d be calling you an AH for *not* telling them.\n\nCongratulations, and wishing you all the best for your pregnancy and parenthood.", "NTA I would let it blow over if it doesn\u2019t, ask him what solution does he want to give you to do. I think he might just be overwhelmed rn and he blew up on you.", "NTA They get ONE day, Not  a month.", "NTA, three weeks is plenty of time.", "No, you are not upstaging his wedding. Sheesh.\n\nNTA", "He gets a DAY. *Not* nearly a wedding month. After that long of a struggle he should be happy for you. And people have three whole weeks to chatter about it. The novelty will wear off or be much less by then. Just be gracious, answer questions but don\u2019t prolong the pregnancy talk. Talk about how excited you are for *them*. NTA but your brother is being one.", "INFO: is the to-be couple going through fertility issues? Outside of that, NTA, but it doesn't hurt to apologize just to smooth shit over.", "Wait, you had the nerve to share your news during the same MONTH of their wedding? /s \nDude needs to settle down and not be a jerk about this. The world doesn\u2019t stop spinning while his wedding is looming. \nNTA but also let it go, at least until after the wedding.", "The happy couple does not get a wedding *month*. They get a wedding *day*. Your are NTA, but your future SIL is a bridezilla (assuming that she's the reason for his change in attitude)", "NTA. Better to say it now rather than have it come out on the wedding day. Maybe it's his fianc\u00e9 who's really upset.", "NTA. No one\u2019s lives pause for anyone else\u2019s. He (and your future SIL) can get over it.", "NTA because he seemed happy when you talked to him so you couldn't have predicted this reaction.", "If you didn\u2019t announce it before, people would have noticed you weren\u2019t drinking or they would overhear about it DURING the wedding and it would have drawn even more attention.  So you did your best. NTA.", "NTA. People are allowed to have their own lives while other people get married. Your brother and his fianc\u00e9 are ridiculous.

It would only be a problem if you announced it at the wedding or the day before.", "People and their weddings are fucking exhausting.\n\nYou don\u2019t own all the days around your wedding. \n\nIt would have been okay to post about it the day before the wedding, the day after the wedding, or any day that wasn\u2019t their wedding day. Period.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\n\nHonestly, if I were you, I wouldn't even attend the wedding now.  Not as a \"look at me protesting the wedding\" but as a \"if you're going to bad mouth me and be pissy, you obviously don't want me at the wedding\".  If you go to the wedding, your brother will scapegoat you if ANYTHING goes wrong at it (which inevitably something will not be perfect) and you will get blamed.  Take the time you were going to go and do something else.  Take a vacation.  See Maui.  Whatever you need to do to make yourself happy and forget your brother even exists.

I assume not all the guests are your family - the rest of them won't care much about you or what you are doing.\n\nJust don't do the gender reveal at the reception..........LOL", "Going with NTA.  Life happens and doesn\u2019t stop for a wedding. Your not drinking likely was going to have people talking and possibly asking you if you are pregnant. Some people can look at you and just know. Most you can do is thank anybody for asking, whatever but today aka wedding day itself, you want the focus on the happy couple. Don\u2019t Facebook such an announcement as I think that can rattle your brother more.", "NTA - I come from 2 large families. In 3 weeks, we could have a wedding, a baptism, and a funeral. Three weeks is a LOOOOOONG time between a pregnancy announcement and a wedding.", "NTA. I\u2019m guessing her told his fianc\u00e9 and she\u2019s the one who\u2019s pissed. They get a day for their wedding, not like a whole month. 3 weeks is definitely long enough time to make an announcement like that. \n\nCongratulations!!!", "NTA. Did he want you to have people bugging for not drinking at his wedding and then expect you to lie to them if they guessed you were pregnant? Three weeks is ample time. Probably the fianc\u00e9e being insufferable.", "NTA. Your brother is ridiculous", "NTA, either you tell people before hand, or you don't drink at the wedding and someone guesses, and three weeks before the wedding is plenty of time. \n\nI bet soon to be sister in-law, or one of her family saw the post. Just wait it out, but expect the bridezilla, or her family, to say something to you at the wedding.", "NTA - Wedding people are exhausting. Is no life to happen for others from the day they get engaged to the day they walk down the aisle? Easy call. It's weeks away and there's enough love to go around!", "NTA\n\nYou didn't take anything away from your brother. He'll be just fine.", "NTA. Yikes OP, I am so sorry you have to deal with this tomfoolery instead of getting to be excited about your life changing news.  It's baffling to me that they can't get past their own selfishness to let you be excited about something you've wanted and didn't think you'd be able to achieve. Three weeks is a pretty long time and it's probable that even if you'd told everyone sooner, they'd still be talking to you about the pregnancy at the wedding.  People take interest in that kind of thing.  But that doesn't mean your pregnancy is more important than their wedding.  My SIL is very competitive/ wants all attention on her so I empathize deeply with the nonsense you're experiencing. Hopefully with time she'll realize she's being foolish. I'm sure your brother is just trying to take his soon to be bride's side to make her happy", "NTA. If you hadn\u2019t announced it then and someone else had revealed it at their wedding or guessed because you aren\u2019t drinking it would\u2019ve been way worse", "NTA - announcing it at the rehearsal or on the wedding day would be inconsiderate.  Pretty much any other time is fine.", "Well, it's a matter of announcing it before, when people could have some time to get used to it, or at the wedding, when you would be turning down alcohol, and then take over the entire wedding party.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nNo don\u2019t apologize. \n\nHow much attention can a pregnancy get at a wedding? Will the guests tie ribbons to you and dance around you like you\u2019re a May pole?\n\nThe people who think every little thing will ruin their wedding are so needy. \n\nI had a fistfight break out at my elegant wedding, and I just owned it and said the party can\u2019t begin unless there\u2019s a fight.", "NTA", "NTA- if your family is like most, you probably headed off a series of questions about why you arent drinking at the wedding. Congratulations!", "This is an increasingly common post on Reddit about people getting absolutely butthurt about having someone else have sone great news at the same time that they do.  It\u2019s such a tiresome and ugly trend.  Like, I can see being mad at someone  who \u201calways\u201d has to upstage others, but otherwise, come on people.  We all share the same world.", "NTA", "NTA", "I'm pretty sure everyone would notice at the time of the wedding that you are pregnant, even if you don't tell them anything  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. 3 weeks is pretty far and honestly you did nothing wrong.", "NTA as long as it\u2019s not the day of the wedding.", "NTA \ni bet SIL got in his ear. he seemed happy for\nyou before so idk why he switched \n\nit\u2019s not like you announced you\u2019re pregnant AT their wedding.", "Absolutely NTA. Stand your ground, OP. What would they have preferred, you announcing your pregnancy at the reception when everyone is going to see your cute bump and notice that you\u2019re not drinking?\n\nI agree that it\u2019s probably your future SIL that\u2019s causing this drama. \n\nYou did everything right with how/when you announced it. Your brothers wedding is not more important than the life you\u2019re growing inside of you (congrats btw!\ud83d\ude0a)", "NTA. I\u2019ve known people who purposely announce their pregnancy and spread the word about it before a wedding so it won\u2019t be news that distracts during the wedding. If you would usually drink at a wedding, people might put 2 and 2 together and then it actually does end up distracting from the wedding.", "I agree, the way he switched from one day to the next...", "And the bride's side won't care.\n\nNTA", "Yeah.  Probably insecure or entitled as heck.", "I announced 4 weeks before my brother\u2019s wedding. My SIL was ecstatic (we asked her to be the godmother) and took a picture day of her wedding with the bump. \n\nI think it all depends on the person. We didn\u2019t announce before my BIL\u2019s wedding because we were only 8 weeks, but my MIL knew because I got \u201cmorning\u201d sickness during the reception and she and my husband\u2019s aunt walked into the bathroom during it. They were good and didn\u2019t tell anyone until the reception was over. My BIL and SIL were then disappointed they didn\u2019t know (but not angry or truly even upset by any means). \n\nSome people are weird about sharing the spot light. Maybe your future SIL feels like an outsider or something already. Maybe she\u2019s a bridezilla. Maybe she made an offhand comment and your brother blew it out of proportion.  \n\nAt this point, wear something that doesn\u2019t super accentuate the bump, don\u2019t take any photos with your hands on the belly in an obvious way during the reception, and move on. Nothing much you can do otherwise, you can\u2019t unannounced a pregnancy, and everyone else\u2019s lives don\u2019t stop for a party."]}
