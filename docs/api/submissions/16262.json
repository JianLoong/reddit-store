You did the right thing. Even if he was just talking shit, it is still very fucking serious and he needs to face serious consequences.

If it wasn\u2019t a genuine threat, then it was a cry for help, and now he\u2019s got the attention he was asking for. Plus, you aren\u2019t even the only one who reported him so it doesn\u2019t even fall squarely on your shoulders. Good job, keep it up", "NTA\n\nNo snitching is if a kid cheats on a test\n\nIf they threaten to shoot up the school, it's ok to tell other people.\n\nYou did the right thing\n\nTake a warm bath, have a treat, relax. \u2763\ufe0f", "You absolutely did the right thing and your actions potentially saved the lives of your classmates and general public. \nHopefully the arrest got this individual the help he needs.", "NTA\n\nYou did what a responsible citizen should do.  You were not the only person to report his comments.\n\nYou did the right thing.\n\nWhat if you had said nothing and he did something that made the national news? \n\nHugs and Good Luck", "NTA. At best you saved lives, and at worse at least there where consequences for their actions and hopefully greater chances of them getting some help/intervention.", "NTA. When I was in high school we had a kid like this. One day he sent a snapchat photo of him holding a gun with the caption \"don't come to school tomorrow\". One of the people who saw it immediately notified the police. Turns out it wasn't a real gun anyways but since he already had a history of calling in bomb threats and threatening people, the police coming was the tipping point that made his parents get him the mental health help that he needed.  \n\\[edit, I forgot the last sentence\\] So, even if that kid wasn't really planning anything that day, this might be the event that could help him get help so that he doesn't end up hurting people in the future.", "No one gets arrested because a teenager told a teacher that they made a comment that sounded threatening.\n\nIf he got arrested. He would have had to have committed a crime (edit there would need to be evidence to suspect a crime). This means that he didn't just say some stupid stuff or talk about idolizing 9/11. He was a credible threat.\n\nYou did the right thing for telling someone. NTA.", "NTA \n\nYou absolutely did the right thing.\n\nA troubled person who not only admires terrorists, but warns people that something is going to happen is a time bomb. He obviously has been planning something. Nobody knows if he would follow through, but it's better to be safe.", "NTA - 100% did the right thing. If he wasn't serious he's now learned that actions have consequences and if he was serious, you've helped save a lot of people. The fact that someone else also reported it should tell you that you did the right thing. It was probably more than just you and one other person. Either way, he needed an intervention one way or the other, so don't feel bad, you did nothing wrong", "NTA. Sympathising with terrorists and vague threats like that are potential signs of radicalisation, the kid needs to be on the law enforcement radar and needs help. It might also have been a credible threat, in which case you could have saved lives. Difficult call, you did the right thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Unfortunately,  school shootings are common now. You should feel comfortable reporting whenever someone starts talking about doing something that makes you nervous. You obviously weren't over reacting since others reported him, too.", "NTA. It's understandable to second guess in a scenario like this, but it's definitely not a laughing matter for him to have been saying those sorts of things, especially in the world as it is today. I don't know if there's a way to get rid of the what-if ponderings surrounding whether or not he was serious, but there are also what-ifs regarding the potential that he wasn't just joking around. You made the call to tell an authority figure about credible worries before anyone had the misfortune of finding out if there was intent for them to be carried out, and that's not wrong nor does it make you the asshole. You made the right choice.", "nta, sorry you had to do that", "Awwww NTA - what a tough position. Hopefully he is getting the help he needs", "NTA.\n\nGiven the sheer amount of shootings we deal with nowadays, you could have very well prevented another one.\n\nHere's hoping that kid gets the help he needs-and he might get it now that you've helped shine a light on his situation.", "NTA!!!", "NTA. You didn't do anything wrong, the stuff he said is pretty messed up and the threats he made are no joke. I do understand the feelings of guilt and you will overcome it. It was so much better for you to be on the safe side, because who knows what else could have happened if you didn't. He could've done some real damage, so just remember that you did the right thing, okay?\n\nI hope you'll feel better soon, stay safe.", "NTA. Always trust your gut instincts. If you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, do what you need to do to feel secure.", "You did right when you reported your school-mate's threats of terrorism. NTA", "NTA \n\nHere's the thing: even if he had no plan, he clearly needs help. Now that he's on the radar of authorities - in school and out - there's a better chance of him getting help.", "You and the other person that reported him are heroes.  You possibly saved lives.  What you heard was a threat against the entire school. Yes it may have been a cry for help and that is what he is getting.  Thank you for keeping your school safe.", "You did the right thing, don\u2019t feel guilty. \nTo be honest, if they arrested him they found something that equaled to probable cause \u2014 if the cops are following actual procedures. \n\nThere\u2019s a real chance you saved lives, if the threats weren\u2019t serious there\u2019s clearly something wrong with him and perhaps this will make his parents get him help. \n\nNTA", "NTA, what you did was incredibly brave, and not many people would do this until the unfortunate hindsight afterwards and the comments of \"I always thought X would do something like this.\" \n\nWith regards to dealing with your emotions right now, please speak to someone you trust, like a counsellor or a friend.", "Easy NTA. Your report supported the first one and made it harder to dismiss. This is not something to joke around about.", "NTA\n\nMaybe it was nothing, and maybe it was something. It\u2019s always better to be safe than sorry in a situation like this. You did the right thing.", "I agree it was the right thing and NTA, but let's not pretend law enforcement doesn't do dumb shit on a regular basis.", "They do. They really do.\n\nI would like to think that the level of silliness needed to imeediatley jump to arresting someone on a single teenager having overheard something, is uncommon."]}
