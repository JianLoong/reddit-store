While she loves the city and school, she hates how expensive everything has become. She does work part-time, but it simply isn't enough. My parents (M77) and (F73) have been sending her money each month, but since they recently retired, they've had to cut back. To fill the gap, my brother (M28) and I (M32) have begun sending some money to our sister from time to time to help with her rent.\n\nI have a well-paying job and a close relationship with my sister, so I'm happy to help where I can. However, my GF (F30) has expressed her dissatisfaction with the arrangement. We've been saving up to buy put a down payment on a house in the future, and my GF believes that my financial contributions to my sister is hindering our progress. Yesterday (which happened to be the day I usually send my sister money), GF told me that we needed to reduce expenses, and one suggestion she made was for me to no longer send money to my sister. She believes that my sister needs to learn how to manage her money better and that my brother (M28) should contribute more. I told her about how I feel a responsibility towards my sister and how my brother doesn't make as much as I do, and while she did acknowledge that she then said I was \"financially na\u00efve\" and said she \"doesn't want me to be taken advantage of\". I was kinda disappointed hearing this, as I made the conscientious decision to help my sister and wasn't falling for some sort of scam.\n\nThe conversation ended because we both had to go to work, but she told me not to send anything until we've further discussed this. During my lunch break at work, I proceeded to send my sister some money and told GF about this over dinner. She told me that she was \"disappointed\". At this point, I was getting a little annoyed and responded by saying I was not willing to comprise my current arrangement with my sister. GF got upset with this and left the table, AITA?\n\nEDIT 1: I make about 15.5k/month and have been putting away 4-6k each month towards a future house. GF makes about 7k/month currently saves around 1k/month for the house. She said she'll contribute more once her student loans are payed off.\n\nI pay for rent and utilities, GF pays for bulk of groceries\n\nI started sending my sister $1500/month since my parents retired\n\nEDIT 2: Sis pays $2800/month in rent and $350/month in transportation. I contribute $1500/month; brother pays $750/month, parents pay $500/month. Our mother was terrified of sis living in NYC on her own and only agreed if she lived in a nicer area and had a car", "created_utc": 1684333552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13k3ads/aita_for_sending_my_younger_sister_money_against/", "score": 251, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But that is not the case. In fact it is the direct opposite. If anything your gf with her loans and smaller contribution of 1k is the one who is \"financially naive\". \n\nIf you do purchase a property with your gf please make sure to put it in an llc and have go through the proper legal channels to have documents in place to protect this investment.

Please separate out her contributions and buy a house under YOUR NAME ONLY, unless you marry.  \n\nShe's being pretty hypocritical about you helping your sister, given how heavily you subsidize girlfriend's lifestyle.  NTA", "NTA. Your sister doesn\u2019t seem to have a spending problem like what your GF thinks. As long as you\u2019re not compromising the life you and your girlfriend are building together, I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t help family.", "NTA: OP, Your personal priority is to ensure your sister gets through school; owning your own home is secondary. This is very reasonable as you currently have a place to live. Your girlfriend wants you to prioritize buying a house and wants to control your finances. She is asking you to violate your ethics & personal commitment, and defer to her decision. No, this is not how things work in a relationship. Big Red Flag!", "NTA this is a bit of a red flag for me that your girlfriend is trying to dictate how you spend your money. It is not her business unless you were financially relying on her or something (like using her money to send to your sister) beyond what would be expected of roommates (like, her splitting the costs of rent/bills for living is not good enough as you have that with roommates). \n\nHowever, i do treat the levels of a relationships differently and distinctly.  \nUnless someone is my spouse - not girlfriend/boyfriend, even not fiance (though it is a transition period where you should be talking about finances and working out how it will work in your marriage) - they do not have any business in my money and how I spend it, unless they are financing me. I also wouldn\u2019t buy a house together with someone else unless we were spouses. That is moving into \u2018marriage-like\u2019 relationship territory, which I don\u2019t go for unless actually married as it has legal implications. Common-law, where I am has different legislation apply to it than actually being legally married, so there are differences that can apply (legal marriage has the upper hand for protections). Girlfriend/boyfriend is not good enough for me to financially entwine myself and have them dictate what I do (to a degree, girlfriends/boyfriends can have input/voice opinion as with any relationship, but no it doesn\u2019t bind me to follow their input and no i don\u2019t have to wait on them or get their input on things like my finances/spending). Not married? then no \u2018marriage like\u2019 parts. I worked too damn hard for my money and my property.\n\nNot everyone has my sentiment and firm distinctions. It sounds like may be okay with a \u2018marriage like\u2019 relationship, being common-law, which is fine, but if you are then yeah, she does get to provide input on how you spend your money, like any spouse would, unless you have specifically not entwined money as spouses. You don\u2019t refer to her as wife though, and you do not identify what arrangements you have between you. You should elaborate, this could easily be a Y T but for now I\u2019ll stick with my NTA. \n\n Your girlfriend isn\u2019t wrong to not like what you\u2019re doing. At 25 your sister should be supporting herself in her endeavors, if she wants to live and go to school in New York. You should have a cut off point to support and it should be a much lower threshold than a parents would be. I have seen too many situations where supporting family becomes a permanent arrangement even when they could be supporting themselves, to the detriment of the family member left paying, to not also side eye that, however, she overstepped that when she called you \u201cfinancially naive\u201d and directed you to not send any more until you two discussed it more. A good number of people pursue a Masters part-time while they work full time, rather than the reverse, because of affordability. Like, is it going to stop once she has her degree? You should periodically re-evaluate it, but you are an adult, it is your family, and it is your money.", "esh your sister sucks for living beyond her means if it takes the whole family plus her working part time.", "NAH\n\nI can totally see your gf point.\n\nI can totally see your point.\n\nPersonally, I'm siding with your gf, but I don't think there's any absolute right or wrong here, just different values.\n\n(And yeah, I noticed that your mom had your sister at age 52)", "Living in NYC I just laugh at this. Hundreds of thousands of people live here, go to school, work and rent all with out family support. I don't think you're an asshole for sending money but your sister is clearly lazy because of all the support she gets. She's 25, she needs to grow up.", "You are NTA.  This isn't necessarily a \"leave your GF\" situation, but it is one where she needs to understand that your money is your money,  and she needs to back off.", "You make almost 200k a year and your GF is worried you sending 18k a year is going to \"hinder your ability to buy a house\"? \n\nWtf and NTA", "NTA \n\nSupporting your sister is good thing, and will pass soon.\nYour gf is not entitled to your money, if anything she saves so much less towards house.\nBe careful with agreement on hooter buying and protect your share", "NTA and don\u2019t marry her or get her pregnant. She thinks she owns your money already", "NTA & get either a co-hab agreement or a pre-nup ASAP", "How much are you giving your sister?", "NTA - first of all, you both have a combined income of $280K a year.  You are saving $4-6K per month for a house and she's contributing $1k due to student loans.  You're not exactly struggling to come up with a down payment.\n\n1. It's your money, you haven't combined finances and she can't tell you how to spend your money\n2. she makes roughly 50% of what you make, but in reality, you pay the rent, the utilities and 20% of the groceries.  Which means, she's probably at most contributing 10-15% to your household, while contributing 25% or less of what you do towards the down payment.  These numbers would indicate that she isn't making additional sacrifices while you are giving money to your sister.\n3. You want to do it, don't feel taken advantage of, and your whole family is helping her.\n\nGirlfriend is just jealous and insecure about your sister.  It's understandable, but as she's entering the relationship with more debt, lower income, and lower contribution to joint expenses (even percentage wise), she's really overstepping her bounds by telling you how to spend your money.", "NTA. \n\nBut your gf is showing some \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nFirst of all, it's your money.

She's using you to pay down her debts.  \n\nAnd I have a feeling that the house will be equally \"shared\" despite the fact that her savings is about 1/6th of the total House fund", "Nta as long as you're covering your bills, what you do with your 'fun money' is your business.", "YTA\n\nYour GF has a point. You both are saving for your future together, houses aren't getting cheaper and interest rates are high. You both have your own bills and life to pay for too. Your sister is in NYC a really expensive place and in college for her *Masters* which means she already has her Bachelors degree. THIS IS HER MASTERS. The cherry on top. The cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. It's like sending her money so she can fly first class while she's already in the exit row. Or giving her money to fix her newer BMW because insurance won't pay for it. She shouldn't be getting a Masters if she can't afford it. She should have a stable job with her Bachelors and then save and work for her own Masters. These are your sister's decisions - where she gets her masters degree, where she works, and I can understand if you were helping her if she was in between jobs and not to lose her mortgage or if she was in a random tight spot. But she's not. \n\n> I feel a responsibility towards my sister\n\nI don't get this aspect. Your parents are the ones who should be responsible. Sending her money once a month or every few months isn't fair to your GF and your future together. You will have your future house, ring, wedding to pay for, honeymoon, saving for a possible child, their college, the list is endless. Would you like it if she gave a bunch of money to her church, random donations, or felt the need to support children in need in the middle east? \n\nI get why her just being your GF may be a bit premature in her getting a say in this, but if you are all serious and live together, then yeah this should be discussed together when you're engaged and married. If my serious GF was helping out her parents, relative, whomever, regardless how trivial their situation was - it would be a red flag to me. I get the random one-off help, but your sister doesn't need help.

You're prioritizing your sibling going for their Masters. When you should prioritize the house and communicating with your GF and compromising.

It's not like she asked you to wait weeks. 24 hours would not have killed your sister. Honestly, when you are dependent on others funding your lifestyle, waiting for funds comes with the territory. What is your sister going to do when you have a major expense and can't afford to send her the same amount? It is fair to openly discuss these things in committed relationships. You may still end up on the same path, but both of you are on the journey and in agreement. \n\nThis is not a question about sending money to your sister.

OP and the family still get to help her to whatever degree they feel comfortable doing.\n\nIn fact, it appears the mother wanted her to be in a nicer building and take cars rather than the metro which is why those expenses are so high.", "It doesn't sound like she is demanding anything though.

How long have you been together? Are you going to get married or considered married by common law?

Since buying a house is a significant point in a couples relationship you are also delaying that for your sisters benefit. \n\nIt isn\u2019t entirely clear to my if your gf is upset at solely the amount or if she thinks your sisters rent is unnecessarily high. If its the latter then she should look at the rent rates in lower crime areas in NYC and see if she finds anything lower (i highly doubt there is). And yes taking the subway alone as a woman is risky. \n\nI see the amount as not making your sisters quality of life better, but more as a guarantee of her safety. I think that preventing your sister from becoming the victim of a significant traumatic event up to and including death is worth a delay of your house. I mean if you lowered your amount and she moved to a worse place and was robbed or worse id imagine youd feel pretty guilty. And i would definitely insist on continuing to help her.

She clearly wants your future home together to be your first priority, also totally valid. \n\nIf you\u2019re buying a house with this woman then it makes sense that you two coordinate finances transparently. The conversation, though, needs to be about values and then finances will follow that lead.\n\nThe only reason I\u2019m saying NTA instead of NAH is because she demanded that you change your routine before having the full conversation, then got huffy about it.", "Was the arraignment with your sister started before you moved in with your gf?  If so, then none of her business.  Either way, you\u2019re not married so your money your choice. NTA", "Not only that; when considering his salary he is only sending his sister $1500 a month!!! She is very controlling over finances that do not impact her in any way.", "You should check the edits. He apparently makes 2x what the GF does per month and saves 4x as much[as in puts away $4k every month to gf saving $1k]despite her only living expense being 80% of groceries.", "Yeah but a lot of students do have family support\n\nShe should ditch the car though. It\u2019s an expense and PIA", "NTA. Your support for tour sister is your choice and is reasonable considering you income and expenses. Don't buy a house with someone you are not married to without consulting an attorney ESPECIALLY if you will be contributing more to the down-payment and mortgage payments.\n\n  \n\n\nDon't get married without talking to a lawyer about prenuptial agreement.", "It's time to point out that from the outside it looks like she's the one taking advantage of you. She benefits from your salary a lot more than your sister.", "Considering the serious discrepancy between your contribution to the house and hers, I very much hope that you\u2019re not planning to give her 50% ownership of the house. \n\nFrom the details you gave, there is someone profiting of you financially, but it\u2019s not your sister.", "Def NTA, OP's girlfriend might be a golddigger if one is feeling particularly uncharitable. As a former New Yorker, unless you are talking about upstate or Long Island, your sister doesn't need a car at all. Save your money. I used to have a two bedroom in Battery Park City for 2700, but that was a long time ago. Does she have roommates? Almost no students and few people under 30 live alone in Manhattan (or Brooklyn and Queens these days). My cousin is a management consultant and had roommates until he got married in his late thirties. Just trying to say, OP's sister can probably cut some expenses if OP and GF agree on it.", "NTA times 100", "soooooooo she is trying to take advantage of your kindness? She is projecting that onto your sister....\n\nYou said you save 4-6x more than her and pay most of the bills. Why should she have a say in how you spend YOUR money? Esp with how much you save? Is she planning on paying half the down payment or is she expecting you to do that? She is showing you who she is, take notes and see if you like who she really is.\n\nYou are a fantastic older brother btw!!!!", "NTA at all,", "He pays her rent and bills. All she pays is for the odd grocery shop. \n\nThe audacity it must take to tell the person who is quite literally housing and paying for you, that they need to stop helping their sister.\n\nGfs selfishness and entitlement to his money is the real slap in the face\u2026", "Covering rent and bills is absolutely financial help when it comes to paying off student loans, though. So if that\u2019s how she sees this then that\u2019s just completely incorrect.", "That is not true in a committed relationship he is talking about buying a house and living with her. If he wasnt that would be another story but with that level of commitment she has some sort of moral right to complain about how he spends his money because he has agreed to mutual finance with her.", "And he's already saving 4-6x as much as the gf towards the house.", "yeah, given the amount he is presumably spending on household bills- he's already helping her pay down her loans. cuz yeah, she's covering 80% of the groceries but even if they're spending $1k/month on groceries, that still means she's spending what $800/month.\n\nWhile he covers rent, utilities and 20% of groceries. (Which is totally fine if that works for them.) But it means that he's definitely helping her both save for their down payment and pay down her loans..", "I agree with you too. I was just sharing an option. I do not believe, if this is the case, he is doing anything wrong. Just providing insight not judgement.\n\nBut she may not see it that way. She may see it as that is money he could give her if he wanted to help someone. Like I said I may not agree with her but could see how she may think this since apparently they are buying a house together and planning a future.\n\nLike I said not saying she is right at all.", "I have to agree with you, what happens when they have bought a house together or gotten married is he still going to pay for his sister.\n\nWhile I do think it's his money he can do as he pleases as he is saving a lot and it's not impacting their lifestyle, I also think this is a prelude to how they handle their finances if they do get married, is he going to ignore his wife's opinion when it comes to spend.", "That\u2019s not expensive for NYC. That\u2019s a walk up studio in a decent area or a room with roomates in a decent area. It\u2019s not gonna be swanky", "plus she's making $7,000 a month! it's not like she's struggling on minimum wage!", "She lives in the suburbs, drives everyehere and still pays $2800/month?  Doesn\u2019t that defeat the purpose of going to school in nyc?", "I mean i think what he is doing is reasonable. My point is that she has a valid reason to be included in financial decisions. And the idea he has no obligation to consider her opinion is ludicrous for a serious relationship.", "There are thousands of apartments in NYC less than that.  Literally 2,000+ apartments available downtown across every neighborhood for under $2,100 on apartments.com", "I\u2019m not saying OP is in any way TA for supporting his sister, but why is the sister\u2019s living situation determined by her parents?  If they were contributing to her expenses I can see how they would have a say in where she lived and the requirement that she have a car.  Personally I\u2019d feel guilty if my siblings were  shelling out that kind of money for me to live that far above my means.", "sounds like a loving family coming together to help her. \n\nSure, it's not the norm for others to do so, but it sounds like no-one has a problem except the gf, when it has nothing to do with her.", "yeah, this all falls to me under the- if OP is fine with how he's is spending money and he can cover his expenses, that's what matters. if they were married and mixed their funds, yeah this should be a conversation but they aren't.\n\nIt's no different than if she wanted to 10k to take her bestie to Europe. it's her money- as long as she can cover her expenses and their agreed on costs, awesome. Whether it's a practical use of money is irrelevant.", "If she had a roommate it would be a 2 bedroom and the price would likely double. So, no she wouldn\u2019t cut it in half", "Meanwhile, GF pays nothing for rent or bills and only pays for groceries. If sister is spoiled, why isn't the GF? Did you have to pay rent while paying off your student loans?", "yeah, I agree the car is a little silly. but depending on the neighborhood you want and the security (i admit, I prefer a doorman building living on my own), yeah- $2800 feels really reasonable for that.\n\na friend lives in near Jersey- her building is asking $4100 for a 1 bdrm this year. yes, it's a luxury building with amenities. and it's jersey.", "She\u2019s 25 and once she graduates will you continue to pay for her even though she has the means and opportunity to live in nyc for less. Also how is she paying for parking, tolls, insurance etc in nyc during the week for under $350a month?  You\u2019re not the AH for helping her out of your budget if you have it. I\u2019m betting your gf has a bigger problem with the idea that you will be paying her way indefinitely bc your mom demands. Ask yourself will you be paying a higher rent and buy nicer cars bc your mom doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re safe in a few years?", "No, OP is able and willing. The family just seem willing (to spend OP\u2019s money). What happens when OP has children of his own? How would it be justified at that stage for him to finance his sister\u2019s luxury lifestyle? And how will the sister develop a work ethic if she has a luxury apartment financed by her brothers as a student?", "NTA your girlfriend needs to figure out how to save more and not dictate how you spend your money.", "If your GF wants to fast-track the house, she should save more of her income. She makes 7k and saves 1k, which leaves her with 6k. If her contribution to your household is food, let's say she spends 1k on groceries, other loans/bills, and 1.5k. She still has 3 .5k leftover...", "So you're going to pay 6x into the down payment what she does, potentially 7x, while already paying the bulk of your living expenses (which I assume is about 75% of your expenses). I really hope y'all are married committed. This is really selfish of her. Over half your income is going towards y'all's joint planning and only a 1/3 of hers is.", "Obviously luxury apartments exist and there are plenty of expensive studio apartments here but I was responding to OC acting as if there are no apartments below $2800. Of course there are.", "Yeah that's true. The fact that she's saving a ton of money by him paying for rent, changes things. I'm just not so gung-ho on him paying for his sibling's education. But to each their own.", "Once she graduates, she either start working or will move back to our parents until she starts working. The last month she was mainly at home from school so didn't have to spend too much on parking, usually it this, groceries, and other miscellaneous expenses that she spends her own money on.", "Im sure op agrees that she shouldnt be in a high crime area. Hes paying for her safety. Also its NYC what do you expect?", "Some people like their mothers and don't want them to worry", "My wife was pushed by a homeless man in the subway. If she had been in the wrong spot she could have fallen on the tracks and died. She refuses to use the subway anymore. There is good reason to fear the subway. But there are still buses.", "if the economy gets worse won't houses be less expensive though?", "I don't think it's a ridiculous price to pay, I just think they're doing a disservice to his sister. I do wonder how/if she'll be able to manage her own finances and life decisions once OP stops paying.", "I like my mom plenty! I would also never dream of having 3 separate family members subsidize my living costs so I don't have to get a roommate at the age of 25.", "Depends on HOW the economy gets worse, and when.", "It's the parents choice but they're not the ones forking up the biggest slice.", "Except the parents are not the ones paying for it. Plus the sister is 25, her parents don\u2019t need to make such choices for her at her age.", "Probably easily if she gets a job at master level. It isnt that hard to manage finances with a real income.", "But they were when this started and the brother is just going on with this. She is also paying part of the rent. The point is girlfriend isn't paying any rent, so I don't think she gets a say. In the end, if the brother is financially comfortable enough to help her, that is his money his business."]}
