{"id": 17480, "submission_id": "13k3ads", "title": "AITA for sending my younger sister money against my GF wishes", "selftext": "My younger sister (F25) is working towards getting her master's degree in New York. While she loves the city and school, she hates how expensive everything has become. She does work part-time, but it simply isn't enough. My parents (M77) and (F73) have been sending her money each month, but since they recently retired, they've had to cut back. To fill the gap, my brother (M28) and I (M32) have begun sending some money to our sister from time to time to help with her rent.\n\nI have a well-paying job and a close relationship with my sister, so I'm happy to help where I can. However, my GF (F30) has expressed her dissatisfaction with the arrangement. We've been saving up to buy put a down payment on a house in the future, and my GF believes that my financial contributions to my sister is hindering our progress. Yesterday (which happened to be the day I usually send my sister money), GF told me that we needed to reduce expenses, and one suggestion she made was for me to no longer send money to my sister. She believes that my sister needs to learn how to manage her money better and that my brother (M28) should contribute more. I told her about how I feel a responsibility towards my sister and how my brother doesn't make as much as I do, and while she did acknowledge that she then said I was \"financially na\u00efve\" and said she \"doesn't want me to be taken advantage of\". I was kinda disappointed hearing this, as I made the conscientious decision to help my sister and wasn't falling for some sort of scam.\n\nThe conversation ended because we both had to go to work, but she told me not to send anything until we've further discussed this. During my lunch break at work, I proceeded to send my sister some money and told GF about this over dinner. She told me that she was \"disappointed\". At this point, I was getting a little annoyed and responded by saying I was not willing to comprise my current arrangement with my sister. GF got upset with this and left the table, AITA?\n\nEDIT 1: I make about 15.5k/month and have been putting away 4-6k each month towards a future house. GF makes about 7k/month currently saves around 1k/month for the house. She said she'll contribute more once her student loans are payed off.\n\nI pay for rent and utilities, GF pays for bulk of groceries\n\nI started sending my sister $1500/month since my parents retired\n\nEDIT 2: Sis pays $2800/month in rent and $350/month in transportation. I contribute $1500/month; brother pays $750/month, parents pay $500/month. Our mother was terrified of sis living in NYC on her own and only agreed if she lived in a nicer area and had a car\n\nEDIT 3: Update - My GF and I had a long talk after work, it didn't go well. To summarize, tensions escalated during the conversation. I told her that I plan to continue helping my sister until she completes her degree, and afterward, she would either start working or move back to our parents' home until she finds a job. However, my GF expressed her belief that my sister (and whole family) is manipulating me and thinks I'm naive enough to send her money regardless of how she uses it. I started to feel increasingly annoyed and defensive by her accusations and asserted that it's my money, and I have the right to spend it as I see fit. I then (stupidly) said that if she really wanted us to buy a house, she should save more and cut back on expenses like nice shoes, clothes, and purses. At this point, she became properly angry and declared that she couldn't stay in the same house as me, and said that she would be going to her friend's house. Before leaving, she said, \"Call me when you stop thinking like a fucking idiot,\" before I could even think I replied, \"I won't be calling.\" \n\nI feel that I may have irreparably damaged our relationship", "created_utc": 1684333552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13k3ads/aita_for_sending_my_younger_sister_money_against/", "score": 713, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But that is not the case. In fact it is the direct opposite. If anything your gf with her loans and smaller contribution of 1k is the one who is \"financially naive\". \n\nIf you do purchase a property with your gf please make sure to put it in an llc and have go through the proper legal channels to have documents in place to protect this investment.

That is not such a big deal IMO and I don\u2019t know why your GF is making such a big deal out of it especially when she can only contribute 1k per month when you\u2019re contributing 4K.", "You are putting a huge amount into the down payment fund.  Please separate out her contributions and buy a house under YOUR NAME ONLY, unless you marry.  \n\nShe's being pretty hypocritical about you helping your sister, given how heavily you subsidize girlfriend's lifestyle.  NTA", "NTA. Your sister doesn\u2019t seem to have a spending problem like what your GF thinks. As long as you\u2019re not compromising the life you and your girlfriend are building together, I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t help family.", "NTA: OP, Your personal priority is to ensure your sister gets through school; owning your own home is secondary. This is very reasonable as you currently have a place to live. Your girlfriend wants you to prioritize buying a house and wants to control your finances. She is asking you to violate your ethics & personal commitment, and defer to her decision. No, this is not how things work in a relationship. Big Red Flag!", "NTA this is a bit of a red flag for me that your girlfriend is trying to dictate how you spend your money. It is not her business unless you were financially relying on her or something (like using her money to send to your sister) beyond what would be expected of roommates (like, her splitting the costs of rent/bills for living is not good enough as you have that with roommates). \n\nHowever, i do treat the levels of a relationships differently and distinctly.  \nUnless someone is my spouse - not girlfriend/boyfriend, even not fiance (though it is a transition period where you should be talking about finances and working out how it will work in your marriage) - they do not have any business in my money and how I spend it, unless they are financing me. I also wouldn\u2019t buy a house together with someone else unless we were spouses. That is moving into \u2018marriage-like\u2019 relationship territory, which I don\u2019t go for unless actually married as it has legal implications. Common-law, where I am has different legislation apply to it than actually being legally married, so there are differences that can apply (legal marriage has the upper hand for protections). Girlfriend/boyfriend is not good enough for me to financially entwine myself and have them dictate what I do (to a degree, girlfriends/boyfriends can have input/voice opinion as with any relationship, but no it doesn\u2019t bind me to follow their input and no i don\u2019t have to wait on them or get their input on things like my finances/spending). Not married? then no \u2018marriage like\u2019 parts. I worked too damn hard for my money and my property.\n\nNot everyone has my sentiment and firm distinctions. It sounds like may be okay with a \u2018marriage like\u2019 relationship, being common-law, which is fine, but if you are then yeah, she does get to provide input on how you spend your money, like any spouse would, unless you have specifically not entwined money as spouses. You don\u2019t refer to her as wife though, and you do not identify what arrangements you have between you. You should elaborate, this could easily be a Y T but for now I\u2019ll stick with my NTA. \n\n Your girlfriend isn\u2019t wrong to not like what you\u2019re doing. At 25 your sister should be supporting herself in her endeavors, if she wants to live and go to school in New York. You should have a cut off point to support and it should be a much lower threshold than a parents would be. I have seen too many situations where supporting family becomes a permanent arrangement even when they could be supporting themselves, to the detriment of the family member left paying, to not also side eye that, however, she overstepped that when she called you \u201cfinancially naive\u201d and directed you to not send any more until you two discussed it more. A good number of people pursue a Masters part-time while they work full time, rather than the reverse, because of affordability. Like, is it going to stop once she has her degree? You should periodically re-evaluate it, but you are an adult, it is your family, and it is your money.", "esh your sister sucks for living beyond her means if it takes the whole family plus her working part time.", "NAH\n\nI can totally see your gf point.\n\nI can totally see your point.\n\nPersonally, I'm siding with your gf, but I don't think there's any absolute right or wrong here, just different values.\n\n(And yeah, I noticed that your mom had your sister at age 52)", "Living in NYC I just laugh at this. Hundreds of thousands of people live here, go to school, work and rent all with out family support. I don't think you're an asshole for sending money but your sister is clearly lazy because of all the support she gets. She's 25, she needs to grow up.", "You are NTA.  This isn't necessarily a \"leave your GF\" situation, but it is one where she needs to understand that your money is your money,  and she needs to back off.", "You make almost 200k a year and your GF is worried you sending 18k a year is going to \"hinder your ability to buy a house\"? \n\nWtf and NTA", "NTA \n\nSupporting your sister is good thing, and will pass soon.\nYour gf is not entitled to your money, if anything she saves so much less towards house.\nBe careful with agreement on hooter buying and protect your share", "NTA and don\u2019t marry her or get her pregnant.

It's your money, you haven't combined finances and she can't tell you how to spend your money\n2. she makes roughly 50% of what you make, but in reality, you pay the rent, the utilities and 20% of the groceries.  Which means, she's probably at most contributing 10-15% to your household, while contributing 25% or less of what you do towards the down payment.  These numbers would indicate that she isn't making additional sacrifices while you are giving money to your sister.\n3. You want to do it, don't feel taken advantage of, and your whole family is helping her.\n\nGirlfriend is just jealous and insecure about your sister.

You both are saving for your future together, houses aren't getting cheaper and interest rates are high. You both have your own bills and life to pay for too. Your sister is in NYC a really expensive place and in college for her *Masters* which means she already has her Bachelors degree. THIS IS HER MASTERS. The cherry on top. The cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. It's like sending her money so she can fly first class while she's already in the exit row. Or giving her money to fix her newer BMW because insurance won't pay for it. She shouldn't be getting a Masters if she can't afford it. She should have a stable job with her Bachelors and then save and work for her own Masters. These are your sister's decisions - where she gets her masters degree, where she works, and I can understand if you were helping her if she was in between jobs and not to lose her mortgage or if she was in a random tight spot. But she's not. \n\n> I feel a responsibility towards my sister\n\nI don't get this aspect. Your parents are the ones who should be responsible. Sending her money once a month or every few months isn't fair to your GF and your future together. You will have your future house, ring, wedding to pay for, honeymoon, saving for a possible child, their college, the list is endless. Would you like it if she gave a bunch of money to her church, random donations, or felt the need to support children in need in the middle east? \n\nI get why her just being your GF may be a bit premature in her getting a say in this, but if you are all serious and live together, then yeah this should be discussed together when you're engaged and married. If my serious GF was helping out her parents, relative, whomever, regardless how trivial their situation was - it would be a red flag to me.

Since buying a house is a significant point in a couples relationship you are also delaying that for your sisters benefit. \n\nIt isn\u2019t entirely clear to my if your gf is upset at solely the amount or if she thinks your sisters rent is unnecessarily high. If its the latter then she should look at the rent rates in lower crime areas in NYC and see if she finds anything lower (i highly doubt there is). And yes taking the subway alone as a woman is risky. \n\nI see the amount as not making your sisters quality of life better, but more as a guarantee of her safety.

In this case, it's your sister, but it could be anyone in the future.  Your gf is of the opinion that adults should be self-supporting.  Maybe she would be okay with sending money to family as a one time emergency, but who knows, since you guys have evidently never discussed this.

She could have attended university closer to your parents, and the money saved in one year would dramatically improve everybody's lives.\n\nYour girlfriend was out of her lane telling you to cut your sister off. You are already saving for your house at a very brisk pace, and contributing much more than she is. She is not missing any meals on account of your sister. However, you responded to mistreatment with mistreatment. Criticizing her personal spending was uncalled-for and unhelpful, and made an attack instead of employing reason. If you love her, why be so harsh with her? If you don't, why are you buying a house with her?\n\nI think your girlfriend's real concern is not about the short-term assistance with your sister's education. Her problem may be that your family are spending tens of thousands of dollars a year of your money as if it is their own. Your sister probably should not be living in the city **at all**, and your mom is making huge financial demands that she wants paid for by you, since it is obvious that nobody else is going to do it. When your sister is done with school, your parents will probably expect you to continue spending a couple grand a month supporting the family in some capacity, whether that's them or your brother or somebody else. It's not unreasonable for you to prioritize your family with a portion of your income, but this isn't an unrealistic source of insecurity for your girlfriend, who wants to know that you are committed to your own financial security. You can afford the help you are giving your family now, but what if something happened to your heath or your career? You are living your life as if everything will always be as good as it is now, which sounds foolish unless there is more information than you have provided.\n\nI don't think you've damaged the relationship irreparably if it's only as bad as you've clearly stated, but you have real problems with your temper and your priorities. You should apologize to your girlfriend for losing your temper. You do not need to apologize for supporting your sister, but just say that the things you said were unhelpful and not called for and you regret them. \n\nYou might want to consider couple's counseling with your girlfriend so these feelings can be handled in a more neutral environment with the support of somebody who is trained to navigate conflict. If she is freaked out by the suggestion of counseling, I would tell her that you care about her concerns and want to make sure that the two of you can talk about them in a neutral and constructive setting. That you don't think she was completely fair, but that her concerns are important and you'd like to do the work together to make sure you're both being fair with each other. The amount of money you make gives you an outsized amount of influence in your relationship, and while I'm sure you don't see the problem with this, your girlfriend does not like feeling like a passenger, or like she is considering building a life with somebody who intends to float his family members forever.", "ESH.. kind of. If you are looking to buy a house together, then you should be looking to marry and start to consider your assets joined. Your GF has a right at this point to have input on big monthly expenses. However, she shouldn't expect you to cut her off immediately. You should discuss a timeline of help and at what level and then your GF can see if she's comfortable with that and if so, you need to stick with the agreement. Paying your 25 yr old sisters NYC rent indefinitely isn't reasonable or fair to your GF, without even getting into the fact that she could easily live comfortably with a roommate for say 2k a month. You could suggest something like reducing by 500 at lease renewal and then another 500 a year later and the next.", "YTA sorry but mom shouldn't have a say in where sister lives. 2800 for an apartment and a car in new york city which a car is basically useless.

This is sort of a taboo subject but it's valuable to understand anyways so I'll say it here. Women are extremely competitive with each other in ways that men simply aren't. Your girlfriend now feels like she is competing with your sister for your resources. Women can be absolutely vicious when it comes to competing for a man and his resources. You are simply helping your sister get to her next stage in life which is a good and normal thing to do, especially with the understanding that it's temporary and something will change soon. To your girlfriend, deep in her subconscious, you should never spend any of your resources on another woman and this will absolutely not stand.", "Devils advocate here, but perhaps your GF is projecting onto your sister?

You are not engaged.  She gets no say in how you spend your money.\n\n2.  It looks as if you pay more than your fair share of monthly expenses.  Your monthly expenses should be divided in accordance with how much each person makes each month.  She should be paying 31% of all of the monthly expenses, and her student loans should not be a factor at all as those are her responsibility and hers alone.  Roll the cost of groceries into the total and split it 69/31.  Unless your rent is extremely low and your groceries are extremely high, you\u2019re going to discover she has been underpaying.  She has a lot of nerve complaining about the help you give your sister when she is continually being given help.  If this relationship is to continue, it\u2019s time to show her the bill on what help she\u2019s been given.\n\nI\u2019m really concerned by her \u201ctelling you\u201d not to give money until you talked rather than asking you.    How bossy is she in other areas?  This seems dictatorial in nature.  In any event, I still think she\u2019s completely overstepping in weighing in at all about how you spend your money.  Personally, if my husband made that much money, I\u2019d want to see him giving some of it away to charity.\n\nAnother thing:  She seems quite concerned about your house down payment, yet you say you\u2019re contributing 4x as much each month.  Yikes!  If the house were to be equally in your names, you should only be matching what she can afford to put in.  You\u2019d be better off buying a house yourself\u2014do NOT put her name on the deed\u2014and having her live with you; the deed could be easily changed if you got married.  You are not married or even engaged, so this should be an equal pot of money.  You should figure out how much excess you\u2019ve placed into that savings and move it to another account that she cannot access.\n\nIDK, you\u2019re getting a really up close look at how she manages finances and what she does when she doesn\u2019t get her way.

Does that genuinely make sense to you? That should continue to pay over 2x what she pays even with the pay difference when she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to contribute 10% of your salary to help your sister not have debt and live in an unsafe place.\nYou should really think about if you want to be tied financially to a house with someone who will always expect you to put their needs and wants above everyone else", "NTA\n\nGood thing you found out before actually buying a house together.", "NTA.

I\u2019m gonna  guess that groceries unless you two are big eaters or into really expensive food is maybe 15% of what you pay so let\u2019s assume $2k for you and $350 for gf. \n\nI am going to guess that you pay for all entertainment such as dinner out, takeout,movies, etc as well you know you make so much more than gf.  \n\nI saw a comment where you do not share accounts with gf so no need to worry about her taking your savings. \n\nIMO it is so selfish and self serving of your gf to say anything about you sending your sister money along with your brother and parents to help her with living expenses while she completes her education when your gf is having YOU subsidize almost all of her living expenses.  \n\nI think you and gf need to have a serious discussion on not only boundaries of what either of you has a say in as far as spending of each other\u2019s income but also take another look at how much she contributes to current living expenses. \n\nSomeone who supposedly wants to save so much money certainly should be taking a break from regularly buying clothes, shoes and whatever else while pleading poverty due to paying her school loans.  \n\nIf you move forward with purchasing a house with gf it would likely be a wise investment to have a lawyer draw up a legal agreement that you and your gf acknowledge in the event the house is sold you are each entitled to recover the amount of down payment contributed to the original purchase from the profit. Then the remaining profits to be distributed based on percentage of house expenses you each paid as I can\u2019t imagine she won\u2019t expect you to still make the full house payment as well as cover insurance and taxes. \n\nIf there is no agreement then it would be likely if you were forced to sell the house it would be a 50/50 split of any profits.  \n\nBest wishes to you OP.", "No judgement however, you should ask your sister to account for her spending.

Her problem may be that your family are spending tens of thousands of dollars a year of your money as if it is their own. Your sister probably should not be living in the city at all, and your mom is making huge financial demands that she wants paid for by you, since it is obvious that nobody else is going to do it. When your sister is done with school, your parents will probably expect you to continue spending a couple grand a month supporting the family in some capacity, whether that's them or your brother or somebody else. It's not unreasonable for you to prioritize your family with a portion of your income, but this isn't an unrealistic source of insecurity for your girlfriend, who wants to know that you are committed to your own financial security.

She literally had no leg to stand on given he is saving 4x more than & he pays the rent + bills & she only pays for 80% of the groceries (and she makes 7k a month wow)! I think she\u2019s jealous of his sister or just greedy. If my partner wanted to support his little sister, Id find that so admirable & sweet! Shes just a bossy greedy jealous hater - OP reconsider being financially connected to this person & if you do marry her, get a pre-nup & be clear who owns how much of the home!", "She wants him to suddenly stop making these payments - it\u2019s like having the rug pulled out from under you and trying to figure out how to replace that $1500 immediately while studying for a master\u2019s - that\u2019s insane!\n\nEdit: grammar fix", "... sorry for answering your question? I won't make that mistake again.", "I didn\u2019t say I agreed. I was just saying this may be the reason she feels this way. I was making an observation! I am by no means saying he needs to stop.\n\n\nBut since everyone is coming at me it is totally unreasonable for siblings to support someone that\u2019s an adult too. The same can be said for his sister. \n\n\nBut if you want to play devils advocate the gf apparently took out loans and put herself through college. I can see where she be a little salty why the sister isn\u2019t doing the same thing but instead is getting a free ride from the brother. The sister is 25 years old. She is plenty old enough to figure out how to take care of herself and not depend on her brothers. A lot of people go to school and work full time.\n\n\nPlus the gf is probably wondering where the support ends. Is the bf going to pay for her wedding? Is he helping buy the house? Is he going to continue to support her after they get married? I think these would all be valid questions.", "I know! I want him as my brother!", "$2800 is not an expensive apartment in NYC, lol. My son and his girlfriend can't find anything below $3100.", "Do you have any idea how difficult it is to get a master\u2019s degree???? If it was easy everyone would have one.", "She being angry when she suggested her to stop buying cloths, shoes ans purses is showing how greedy she is.. she wants her money and his too..", "even if thats how she feels, that still makes her an AH. \n\nthey collectively make over 20k a month, they absolutely are not hurting for money in any way shape or form, and 1.5k is not going to leave any dent in their finances at all. OP pays all of their rent and utilities, so she doesnt even have to worry about rent payments, while he\u2019s also saving *four thousand dollars* a month **at minimum** for a house. at this point, that 1.5k is close to pocket change for him, and she wants him to stop because, in your opinion, she\u2019s jealous? \n\nany way you cut it, she\u2019s acting like an AH", "OP's parents probably paid for his college. Now he wants to do the same for his sister since his parents no longer can. GF has no reason to be salty, since she is definitely benefitting by how his parents helped him (as he apparently does not have student loans and can save 7x the amount as she is saving towards their future home). She is obviously benefitting so much from her relationship with him. Let him help his sister however he pleases. She still comes out far ahead.\n\nIf she had never met her BF, she would have to pay her student loans off all by herself and still pay rent, utilities and groceries. He is helping her massively already. If I were Op, I would be very turned off by her jealousy and greed.", "I mean it's expensive enough that she lives alone AND has a place to store her car to drive into work every day. Plus costs for gas, parking, etc. It's living far beyond her means given the information we have.", "Are your son and GF splitting that $3100? Or are they each demanding to live alone in a $3100 apartment?", "what", "Out of $7k/month she contributes $1k towards the house, plus groceries. What is she spending 5k+ a month on? How many new clothes, etc. does she need?\n\nIt's your money and you have offered to help your sister out. I respect this decision greatly. NTA", "I get that too. Like o said I can see both sides of an argument. I really didn\u2019t judge one way or the other.\n\n\nI can see his reasoning why he wants to help. I can also see her points of where does this end. They want to buy a house and other things. But like I said I can see both sides.", "Because the parents used to help support her. The time and money commitment to move probably isn't that different than helping out till she graduates in the same place.", "Do you know anything about NYC? This information means that she actually lives out of the city and that her rent is STILL that high. She has a car because she probably has to commute to the train station to even get to the city.", "It\u2019s really difficult. Depending on the major it can be super hard. So much so most people can\u2019t sustain a job while getting one because they are working and putting all their effort energy into getting a master\u2019s degree. Hence why they are helping.", "Personally I don't see how your mother would \"let\" her adult daughter do anything or not.  She's not a kid.  \n\nNYC didn't become expensive overnight, it's been that way forever.  She should absolutely be providing her own way there like so many other's are.", "A 2-bedroom is not double the price of a one-bed or studio because the apartment size doesn\u2019t double. In a quick scan of my neighborhoods current inventory a 1-bed in a prewar building (excluding the new builds) looks to be about $2,000-2,300 and a 2-bed in a similar building is $2,900-$3,200. Interestingly, the 3-beds are mostly under $3,500.", "Yeah, if she\u2019s complaining about how you spend your money while not really contributing much before your\u2019re even married, then you really need to look at a pre-nup before you do get married.", "How much does she have in student loans still? What's her balance?", "She has a car because she refuses to take public transit. It's in the OP's comments.", "What does this have to do with \"they are living alone in an expensive city and refusing to take the very available and easy public transit and instead insisting their car-driven lifestyle is also subsidized\"?\n\nLook, if that money was being sent to someone head down on their masters living within their means, sure, got it, I think that's praiseworthy. But when the entire family is sending thousands a month so someone can live alone and avoid the poors in their own private vehicle, that's a different discussion.", "There is a lot of difference between \"letting\" her daughter do something and \"allowing\" her daughter do something.\n\nCould OPs sister study in NYC without her moms approval? Technically, yes.\n\nIs her mother right to demand conditions if she is supporting her financially?\nDefinitely.\n\nJust because the conditions go beyond \"don't fail out\" doesn't mean they aren't valid.", ">What happens when OP has children of his own?\n\nPresumably, her master's degree would be completed by then.", "It\u2019s expensive in NY $2800 is low in NYC. If she has a car it\u2019s because it can be dangerous taking public transportation early & late in the day. Especially for a female that is new in this city. I said it\u2019s hard bc you said she is spoiled. It\u2019s hard to get this type of degree & it obvious she is NY bc she is going to a prestigious school here. Saying she is spoiled is not true. If she was here trying to be an actor or unemployed and doing nothing - ok - but she pursuing a degree that is challenging and is difficult to pursue without having a job. Imagine with one.", "Unfortunately, I do agree that you also need to revise the lifestyle of your sister. Her money habits and living conditions are negatively impacting your relationships. I think it is important to help out your sister finish her degree but to address what is not a sustainable way.", "Some people like their mothers enough to not want to waste their retirement money", "Assuming that is indeed when the funding stops."]}
