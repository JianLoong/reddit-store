While she loves the city and school, she hates how expensive everything has become. She does work part-time, but it simply isn't enough. My parents (M77) and (F73) have been sending her money each month, but since they recently retired, they've had to cut back. To fill the gap, my brother (M28) and I (M32) have begun sending some money to our sister from time to time to help with her rent.\n\nI have a well-paying job and a close relationship with my sister, so I'm happy to help where I can. However, my GF (F30) has expressed her dissatisfaction with the arrangement. We've been saving up to buy put a down payment on a house in the future, and my GF believes that my financial contributions to my sister is hindering our progress. Yesterday (which happened to be the day I usually send my sister money), GF told me that we needed to reduce expenses, and one suggestion she made was for me to no longer send money to my sister. She believes that my sister needs to learn how to manage her money better and that my brother (M28) should contribute more. I told her about how I feel a responsibility towards my sister and how my brother doesn't make as much as I do, and while she did acknowledge that she then said I was \"financially na\u00efve\" and said she \"doesn't want me to be taken advantage of\". I was kinda disappointed hearing this, as I made the conscientious decision to help my sister and wasn't falling for some sort of scam.\n\nThe conversation ended because we both had to go to work, but she told me not to send anything until we've further discussed this. During my lunch break at work, I proceeded to send my sister some money and told GF about this over dinner. She told me that she was \"disappointed\". At this point, I was getting a little annoyed and responded by saying I was not willing to comprise my current arrangement with my sister. GF got upset with this and left the table, AITA?\n\nEDIT 1: I make about 15.5k/month and have been putting away 4-6k each month towards a future house. GF makes about 7k/month currently saves around 1k/month for the house. She said she'll contribute more once her student loans are payed off.\n\nI pay for rent and utilities, GF pays for bulk of groceries\n\nI started sending my sister $1500/month since my parents retired\n\nEDIT 2: Sis pays $2800/month in rent and $350/month in transportation. I contribute $1500/month; brother pays $750/month, parents pay $500/month. Our mother was terrified of sis living in NYC on her own and only agreed if she lived in a nicer area and had a car", "created_utc": 1684333552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13k3ads/aita_for_sending_my_younger_sister_money_against/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But that is not the case. In fact it is the direct opposite. If anything your gf with her loans and smaller contribution of 1k is the one who is \"financially naive\". \n\nIf you do purchase a property with your gf please make sure to put it in an llc and have go through the proper legal channels to have documents in place to protect this investment.

Please separate out her contributions and buy a house under YOUR NAME ONLY, unless you marry.  \n\nShe's being pretty hypocritical about you helping your sister, given how heavily you subsidize girlfriend's lifestyle.  NTA", "NTA. Your sister doesn\u2019t seem to have a spending problem like what your GF thinks. As long as you\u2019re not compromising the life you and your girlfriend are building together, I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t help family.", "NTA: OP, Your personal priority is to ensure your sister gets through school; owning your own home is secondary. This is very reasonable as you currently have a place to live. Your girlfriend wants you to prioritize buying a house and wants to control your finances. She is asking you to violate your ethics & personal commitment, and defer to her decision. No, this is not how things work in a relationship. Big Red Flag!", "NTA this is a bit of a red flag for me that your girlfriend is trying to dictate how you spend your money. It is not her business unless you were financially relying on her or something (like using her money to send to your sister) beyond what would be expected of roommates (like, her splitting the costs of rent/bills for living is not good enough as you have that with roommates). \n\nHowever, i do treat the levels of a relationships differently and distinctly.  \nUnless someone is my spouse - not girlfriend/boyfriend, even not fiance (though it is a transition period where you should be talking about finances and working out how it will work in your marriage) - they do not have any business in my money and how I spend it, unless they are financing me. I also wouldn\u2019t buy a house together with someone else unless we were spouses. That is moving into \u2018marriage-like\u2019 relationship territory, which I don\u2019t go for unless actually married as it has legal implications. Common-law, where I am has different legislation apply to it than actually being legally married, so there are differences that can apply (legal marriage has the upper hand for protections). Girlfriend/boyfriend is not good enough for me to financially entwine myself and have them dictate what I do (to a degree, girlfriends/boyfriends can have input/voice opinion as with any relationship, but no it doesn\u2019t bind me to follow their input and no i don\u2019t have to wait on them or get their input on things like my finances/spending). Not married? then no \u2018marriage like\u2019 parts. I worked too damn hard for my money and my property.\n\nNot everyone has my sentiment and firm distinctions. It sounds like may be okay with a \u2018marriage like\u2019 relationship, being common-law, which is fine, but if you are then yeah, she does get to provide input on how you spend your money, like any spouse would, unless you have specifically not entwined money as spouses. You don\u2019t refer to her as wife though, and you do not identify what arrangements you have between you. You should elaborate, this could easily be a Y T but for now I\u2019ll stick with my NTA. \n\n Your girlfriend isn\u2019t wrong to not like what you\u2019re doing. At 25 your sister should be supporting herself in her endeavors, if she wants to live and go to school in New York. You should have a cut off point to support and it should be a much lower threshold than a parents would be. I have seen too many situations where supporting family becomes a permanent arrangement even when they could be supporting themselves, to the detriment of the family member left paying, to not also side eye that, however, she overstepped that when she called you \u201cfinancially naive\u201d and directed you to not send any more until you two discussed it more. A good number of people pursue a Masters part-time while they work full time, rather than the reverse, because of affordability. Like, is it going to stop once she has her degree? You should periodically re-evaluate it, but you are an adult, it is your family, and it is your money.", "esh your sister sucks for living beyond her means if it takes the whole family plus her working part time.", "NAH\n\nI can totally see your gf point.\n\nI can totally see your point.\n\nPersonally, I'm siding with your gf, but I don't think there's any absolute right or wrong here, just different values.\n\n(And yeah, I noticed that your mom had your sister at age 52)", "Living in NYC I just laugh at this. Hundreds of thousands of people live here, go to school, work and rent all with out family support. I don't think you're an asshole for sending money but your sister is clearly lazy because of all the support she gets. She's 25, she needs to grow up.", "You are NTA.  This isn't necessarily a \"leave your GF\" situation, but it is one where she needs to understand that your money is your money,  and she needs to back off.", "You make almost 200k a year and your GF is worried you sending 18k a year is going to \"hinder your ability to buy a house\"? \n\nWtf and NTA", "NTA \n\nSupporting your sister is good thing, and will pass soon.\nYour gf is not entitled to your money, if anything she saves so much less towards house.\nBe careful with agreement on hooter buying and protect your share", "NTA and don\u2019t marry her or get her pregnant. She thinks she owns your money already", "NTA & get either a co-hab agreement or a pre-nup ASAP", "How much are you giving your sister?", "NTA - first of all, you both have a combined income of $280K a year.  You are saving $4-6K per month for a house and she's contributing $1k due to student loans.  You're not exactly struggling to come up with a down payment.\n\n1. It's your money, you haven't combined finances and she can't tell you how to spend your money\n2. she makes roughly 50% of what you make, but in reality, you pay the rent, the utilities and 20% of the groceries.  Which means, she's probably at most contributing 10-15% to your household, while contributing 25% or less of what you do towards the down payment.  These numbers would indicate that she isn't making additional sacrifices while you are giving money to your sister.\n3. You want to do it, don't feel taken advantage of, and your whole family is helping her.\n\nGirlfriend is just jealous and insecure about your sister.  It's understandable, but as she's entering the relationship with more debt, lower income, and lower contribution to joint expenses (even percentage wise), she's really overstepping her bounds by telling you how to spend your money.", "NTA. \n\nBut your gf is showing some \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nFirst of all, it's your money.

She's using you to pay down her debts.  \n\nAnd I have a feeling that the house will be equally \"shared\" despite the fact that her savings is about 1/6th of the total House fund", "Nta as long as you're covering your bills, what you do with your 'fun money' is your business.", "YTA\n\nYour GF has a point. You both are saving for your future together, houses aren't getting cheaper and interest rates are high. You both have your own bills and life to pay for too. Your sister is in NYC a really expensive place and in college for her *Masters* which means she already has her Bachelors degree. THIS IS HER MASTERS. The cherry on top. The cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. It's like sending her money so she can fly first class while she's already in the exit row. Or giving her money to fix her newer BMW because insurance won't pay for it. She shouldn't be getting a Masters if she can't afford it. She should have a stable job with her Bachelors and then save and work for her own Masters. These are your sister's decisions - where she gets her masters degree, where she works, and I can understand if you were helping her if she was in between jobs and not to lose her mortgage or if she was in a random tight spot. But she's not. \n\n> I feel a responsibility towards my sister\n\nI don't get this aspect. Your parents are the ones who should be responsible. Sending her money once a month or every few months isn't fair to your GF and your future together. You will have your future house, ring, wedding to pay for, honeymoon, saving for a possible child, their college, the list is endless. Would you like it if she gave a bunch of money to her church, random donations, or felt the need to support children in need in the middle east? \n\nI get why her just being your GF may be a bit premature in her getting a say in this, but if you are all serious and live together, then yeah this should be discussed together when you're engaged and married. If my serious GF was helping out her parents, relative, whomever, regardless how trivial their situation was - it would be a red flag to me. I get the random one-off help, but your sister doesn't need help. And just because you make more doesn't mean you should feel any obligation.\n\n>We've been saving up to buy put a down payment on a house in the future\n\n\"We\" = you and your GF. You're prioritizing your sibling going for their Masters. When you should prioritize the house and communicating with your GF and compromising.

It's not like she asked you to wait weeks. 24 hours would not have killed your sister. Honestly, when you are dependent on others funding your lifestyle, waiting for funds comes with the territory. What is your sister going to do when you have a major expense and can't afford to send her the same amount? It is fair to openly discuss these things in committed relationships. You may still end up on the same path, but both of you are on the journey and in agreement. \n\nThis is not a question about sending money to your sister.

OP is paying nearly all the shared expenses for him and his girlfriend and contributing 80%+ of the money towards the goal of a down payment. He is doing more than his fair share. GF has no grounds to argue he does not sufficiently prioritize the goal of a house. She doesn\u2019t get to pocket watch all of his money.", "According to what OP has said\n\nHe makes approximately $186,000 a year and is giving his sister $18,000 a year", "$1500. And it is 10% of his monthly income and he puts more in the housing fund.", ">your parents helped you and your brother during your studies\n\nYes, we would't have made it through out studies without their regular financial support. Since they had us at such an old age, they can't really work like they used to so me and my brother want to kinda take on their role for our sister", "Then absolutely NTA. I personally would be weary about how someone wants to dictate to you like this about money. Especially considering it appears you contribute substantially more to shared expenses.", "Then one option is for your girlfriend to make/save more money since you are paying rent and utilities. \n\nShe has balls, I will give you that, to say to the person who is paying her way, that you should stop helping your sister.", "What kinda rent is she paying where she needs a part-time job, you sending her 1500$, your brother sending her money, and her parents sending her money, to be able to pay it? I mean NYC is expensive - I live here - but that's nuts", "How much does your GF make? And how much is she saving towards the house?", "Why don't you read his posts instead of his edit. His sister is living in a 2.8k/mo apartment leeching off his family while she works part time. She's spending more than double the amount of a monthly metro card on transportation while leeching off her family. She can live here on half the costs while still leeching off her family.", "Her family pays for her expensive apartment and she drives into the city every day. She's spoiled.", "So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the GF\u2019s business yet BUT what is the long term plan? OP- are you going to be paying your sister\u2019s way for the next five years? Til she gets a full time job? I\u2019d be hesitant to buy a house with someone who I\u2019m not financially compatible with.", "Even with OP's edits my point still stands. She's paying for her student loans and also towards the house. Based on principle, when they are living together and saving for the future, she has some say in it too. \n\nAnd the sister still shouldn't be getting anything. Mother shouldn't have much say in this especially if they didn't contribute to her college later on. If she can't afford it then she shouldn't go to NYC for college....for her masters. \n\nAt him bringing home $15k home a month, this is a pick your battles situation. Yeah if GF and him are going to have a future together at a certain point she will have a say in the combined income of the household. At what dollar amount or donation shouldn't she?", "She pays $2800/month in rent and spends about $350/month on transportation. I  pay $1500/month, brother pays $750/month, parents pay $500/month", "She makes around 7k/month", "Good questions. Also, do you have an emergency fund? Either for yourself or for as the two of you as a couple?", "A 2800 apt in NYC is a very basic very small studio. No one considers her a leech. It sounds like both older bros received similar support from parents.\n\nMeanwhile girlfriend is living rent free at OPs place while OP is contributing 4x as much as she is towards their down payment. And that isn't enough for her; she wants OP to cut sis off so she gets more. She sounds like the actual leech.", "Why don't you read the edits! OP's mother insisted the sister live in a nicer area if she went to school in NYC. The parents were paying for it until they retired, that's when the brothers on their own decided to take over. There is no mention of sister begging anyone for help.", "I have read them. OP and the family still get to help her to whatever degree they feel comfortable doing.\n\nIn fact, it appears the mother wanted her to be in a nicer building and take cars rather than the metro which is why those expenses are so high.", "It doesn't sound like she is demanding anything though. Spoiled would be if she is demanding that her brother keep paying. \n\nIt sounds like the mother demanded the expensive apartment and the car access and OP is willing to contribute for his mother's peace of mind.", "I was planning on paying for the next year and half (which is roughly how long it should take her to complete her masters). At this point she'd most likely have a job or move back to Mom and Dad until she gets a job", "He is paying 80%+ of there combined contribution towards of the house. He is paying 25-38% of his income towards the house (GF is only contributing 15% of her income). Her assertion is that he isn\u2019t sufficiently prioritizing the house. She has no ground on which to make that argument.\n\nOP\u2019s comments indicate that his parents provided similar contributions towards him while going through school. Probably why he isn\u2019t steeped in student loan debt. So, it makes complete sense why he feels an obligation towards his sister. \n\nThe GF does not get to tell OP what to do with his money if his portion of the shared expenses are covered. Everything else is HIS money.", "2800 a month in rent? Lol that's almost double what I pay in rent, and I live alone, in Manhattan. Sorry but she's living outrageously for someone who is relying on others to keep her afloat. And why the heck is her transportation so high? $127 is the cost for an unlimited metrocard, what else is she spending on? Metro north? LIRR?", "lmao 2.8k/month while leeching off her family when she could get 1 roommate and cut that in half in a decent apartment. Why would you not lead with this? Your girlfriend is not the asshole, neither are you. Your sister is.", "It sounds like she needs to get a place with roommates. Living alone is a luxury. She\u2019s not entitled to live alone one someone else\u2019s dime.", "I think your sister is surely spoilt. Can she get a smaller, cheaper Apartment? Sure, Look into it\nWould she do it? No because why make yourself uncomfortabel when your Life ist beeing sponsort by your Family. \n\nYTA because your GF is right. She has Student loans because she didn't have someone Pamper her ass Up. So  in my View, If i worked my Butt Off, Studien, working and taking Out loans - seeing someone Like that makes me wanna hurl", "How much does she save towards the house?", "That is definitely my interpretation of this situation. It will take GF very long to save enough for a down payment (especially if your goal is 20%). And I doubt she could even get a loan for the quality of house she has in mind. While OP after a year could get a really good house just with the money he saved.", "That's funny because I live in a 1BR and don't pay that. Yes this city is expensive but you can live without paying almost 3k a month in rent. And you definitely don't NEED to pay hundreds a month for car expenses in the city. Not when the subway is 2.75 a swipe or $127 for an unlimited metro card.", "I live in NYC, I know exactly what $2800 can get. She is 25 years old with a part time job and a bachelors degree. She is a leech and needs to grow up.", "Have you discussed that timeline with your GF and sister? I could see being hesitant about a future house if there is no timeline for covering your sister\u2019s expenses.", "Agree to disagree", "Yeah its pricy. A big part of this was because my mom was terrified of the idea of my sister living in NYC all on her own. The only way we could convince her was if sis lived in a nicer area and drove instead of taking the metro. Ironically,  GF found the place", "Some people are just more fortunate in life. The family is able and willing to help the sister live an easier life with no harm to themselves. So why not? GF is also not suffering from OP helping his sister.", "Regardless of whether or not the GF is right about OP\u2019s sister being spoiled, she does not get to complain about how OP spends his money when he is doing 75-88% of the saving towards the house.", "She saves 1k/month for the future house. She said she'll save more once she's payed off her student loans", "But the parents insisted on a more expensive place and car because they are terrified of her living in NYC. So it sounds like parents are calling the shots here.", "Why is gf barely saving 1k against OP saving 4.5k and barely contributing to expenses not a leech, but his sister, who he sends 1k for since she is studying, living according to her family's wishes and who he loves and wants to support, a leech? \n\nAnd at whatever stage of education or life, when brother helps sister or vice versa, since they can easily afford it, and was conscientious decision , why are the siblings called leech? \n\nYou do realise sibling has more relationship with each other than gf? And if guy is paying for gf's expenses or college, it would be fine, cause they are supporting their SO?\n\nAlso not to mention most relationships end. Marriages and gf -bf. But it's ok for SO to support each other. But not the siblings they grew up with. \n\nIn this case, he is literally not shirking any of his responsibilities. He is paying more for current expense and saving way more. 4.5 out of 15.5 is greater portion of income than gf's 1/7. It seems gf is acting entitled to his money and dictating what he should do, spend it only on her.", "They both know, GF has been wanting to fast track getting a house as the economy gets worse which I guess is partially why the arrangement is upsetting her now", "That\u2019s fine, but the objective data shows that the GF is financially dependent on OP as much, if not more so, than the sister. If you think contributing 25-38% of his income towards a shared goal isn\u2019t good enough, she is free to leave and try to get a house on her own.", "Your sister is 25! Your mom's feelings about this don't really matter, she could be living in a much cheaper place", "So she's mature enough to get a master's degree, but apparently incapable of taking the subway. Or rather, it's that she can't be with us plebs on the train. God forbid LOL rme", "if your parents insist that she needs to live in a nicer area and have a car, they should be responsible for the additional living costs, i get they retired but then they should\u2019ve compromised and let her live someplace cheaper and take public transportation so she isn\u2019t living outside her means", "Agree on all counts. Sister is an adult and can take the subway like everyone else. I take it by myself when I visit and haven\u2019t had any issues. Not saying crime never happens there, but it\u2019s no more dangerous than just walking down the street. \n\nGirlfriend doesn\u2019t get to dictate how OP spends his money since he\u2019s contributing way more to their house fund to begin with. I think he said he also pays rent and utilities for their apartment, too? I think I saw that in a comment anyway.", "It does sound like that, but that has nothing to do with that person claiming you can't live here under 2800 and in anything bigger than a studio lol. I mean that's just false. NYC is not a terrifying place (although ironically it's drivers that can make living here scary). The sister is being coddled.", "Yep, GF seems to want to quickly get the house, and if they breakup (which is more likely than not), she can try to claim half and fleece OP.", "I mean, she absolutely has a point there.", "Maybe, but like I said this is the parents choice."]}
