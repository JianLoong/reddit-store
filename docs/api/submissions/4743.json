We got the biggest bedroom, but out of the children bedrooms there is one specifically large. I had said that will be Maddie\u2019s room, since she has the most toys and furniture and it\u2019s the second closest room to our bedroom. (The closest is the babies room.) Maddie has a big inflatable princess bed(shaped as a castle that takes up most of a normal sized room) she has several toy chest, and princess castle forts. These things made her room pretty crowded at our old house. This wasn\u2019t an issue because she had a big bedroom and Jude\u2019s bedroom was the attic, so they both had big bedrooms.\n\nWell my gf doesn\u2019t agree that Maddie should get this bedroom. She thinks Jude should get it since he\u2019s the the oldest. I told her that wouldn\u2019t make sense bc Jude deserves the privacy as his bedroom would b on the other side of the house and he has much less things for his room and she shouldn\u2019t make Maddie put up her everyday toys and items she\u2019s use to having (bc she suggested packing some stuff away). She told me it didn\u2019t make a difference and I was an excluding Jude AH. She\u2019s now saying she should\u2019ve rethought our living situation.

She might be into a cool loft style bed, and that would give her space underneath.  \n\nThis also sounds really crazy, but when we lived in Japan and the houses were much smaller than the US, I knew some families who would basically have their kids switch rooms once a year. Those kids were closer in age though. But yeah, I think as a general rule the oldest kid needs the biggest room. There is room for compromise but YTA", "YTA for handing her a decision rather than discussing it as a family. I also think you're setting up trouble for the future treating your 5yo as a little princess who doesn't have to put her toys away, but that's just my view.\n\nThere could be a way to redeem yourself. A 13yo boy might prefer to be further away from his parents' room, and you can build on that by talking to both of them about how to upgrade it to the kind of room a teenage boy wants, such as building a good study area where he can also game with his mates, and age-appropriate decor so he feels good when a friend comes over.", "so in a couple years when Maddie doesn\u2019t want the giant inflatable bed anymore, will she have to move out of the big room?  Since that\u2019s a big justification in your mind?  \n\nI\u2019m guessing no.  YTA.  Why does Maddie have so much more than Jude?  13 year olds like toys and stuff too.  Why does your bio daughter get more than her son? \n\nAlso - does Maddie have more toys than you?  If so shouldn\u2019t she have the biggest of the 4, not you two?

I will say, though, that it feels pretty sketchy that you're assuming your daughter should get the bigger bedroom because she has more stuff, considering the context of Jude not being your son.

I don\u2019t agree that mom & dad automatically get the biggest bedroom. Why? You have the whole house to decorate & put your stuff in. Kids only have their bedroom as their own space. When the parents have people over, they don\u2019t entertain them in their bedroom the way kids do. Parents use their bedroom to sleep & change clothes in.

I was just busting your balls. Glad to see you have a sense of humor :-)", "Very cute but I would argue if it doesn't fit in her room and or can't be stored for easy enough access it is in fact too much stuff personally for a five year old. Including princess forts. Sounds like you need to prioritize her favorites or get smaller furniture to make her stuff fit in the room.", "My parents moved house 2 years ago with my siblings (all still living at home as housing costs are mad in our bit of the UK and they're just starting out in their careers) and the rule was that eldest got to pick their room, then 2nd eldest etc.\n\nThis did require some negotiation in the end as one sibling picked the room whose en-suite had a bathtub, but they don't take baths. Youngest sibling loves baths and didn't want to only have shower access. They ultimately swapped as the eldest realised they preferred the way they could arrange their furniture in the slightly smaller room and liked the view from the window more, youngest was happy to get a bathtub without needing to ask to use someone elses bathroom.\n\nThis is why you need to ask people, so they can make sure own preferences known. Someone will settle for a smaller room with more privacy, others want a larger room but a shared bathroom, or they want to be away from a noisy road etc.", "So he doesn\u2019t need room for a gaming set up?  And a desk for homework and all that?\n\nAnd you never answered.  What happens when Maddie grows outta that bed and all those toys?  Or are you gonna make her keep the inflatable princess bed til she moves out at 18?", "Y'all VR needs a 10x10 clear space, so I don't know why this is an argument. You can put shit in forts, but you can't clear out more space for your VR if you don't have it.", "I read the post. The info was added after my comment.", "Not exactly. But they fit the tune. Which you should definitely check out (along with the entire Beatles songbook).", "Oh yah, I agree with the ESH. There seems to be a lot of missing reasons in OP\u2019s post, but clearly, his GF made a poor decision to go through with the whole house purchase and renovation without having this conversation first.", "Ask him directly which room he\u2019d prefer, but be prepared for him to pick the larger room.\n\nThat is a good way to compromise here.   The oldest child gets to pick his own room.   You can set up some of the extra toys in the living room if he does pick the larger room.", "It doesn\u2019t make sense at all. The only guess I can make is that if they bring the GF\u2019s son into the conversation, then OP will try and pressure the kid to give up the big room (with all of the associated arguments that the daughter has more stuff), and the GF is worried that it will hurt her son\u2019s feelings? Or that the son will just give into whatever OP wants to avoid drama. I get the sense she feels like she needs to protect her son here by NOT asking him.\n\nThis is one of those posts where it feels like OP is only giving us cherry-picked info. I would love to hear the flip side of this pancake.", "Or it\u2019s possible she\u2019s excluding him because the increase in privacy doesn\u2019t really justify the drop in size- like maybe it\u2019s just five feet further down the hall, but half the size of the other.", "This is the only correct answer. He's old enough to make a choice and would probably pick the room with privacy. \n\nYTA for not asking the kid.", "This is exactly how they should go about it! I wish I had an award to give.. here\u2019s my poor man\u2019s silver instead! \ud83e\ude99", "Exactly. \n\nLet Jude pick. Then Jude feels especially included \n\nUNLESS OP has been dropping hints that his Princess should get the biggest room and is bullying Jude already to select the attic!", "OP\u2019s girlfriend doesn\u2019t want to ask her son because she thinks he will feel left out. I wonder if there is precedent for things like this happening in the past?\n\nRegardless, this family seems to have some major communication issues.", "I understand. It\u2019s just very hard when she enjoys and plays in them daily.", "When she grows out of it she\u2019ll have a new bed. She\u2019s still very obsessed with Disney princesses so I don\u2019t think that will be anytime soon.", "Either that or GF is picking a fight and knows Jude wouldn\u2019t want that room. \n\nIf she\u2019s feeling the need to stretch her wings with the new house and baby and Jude, she may be in a spitting contest over something Jude doesn\u2019t even want.", "I'd feel more left out if I found out my parents were having arguments over which bedroom I should have without asking me which I want.\n\nI appreciate that his mom is trying to stick up for him since step-dad only cares about his bio-kid, but I honestly think treating him like an active member of the family by letting him pick his own room would be the better move.", "Good luck with the big move! Hopefully you and your wife can communicate and get over this hump and she can understand your intentions for him to get privacy. I'd definitely give the teenager the option to choose personally overall. Hopefully your wife can see that as a fair option so that Jude doesn't complain down the road and if he does it was his decision which room to pick anyway. Haha", "But at some point in the next 13 years - all these things you think justify her having the bigger room won\u2019t be around anymore.  But she\u2019ll still have it.  Because she\u2019s your kid unlike Jude.\n\nCause a 5 year old likes Disney princesses and wants the big inflatable princess bed.  But Is a 10 year old girl?  I can guarantee a 13 year old girl won\u2019t want that in her room when she invites friends over. \n\nYou\u2019re planning for now, in a home that you\u2019ll live in for years.  Why not give Jude the big bedroom til he turns 18.  He moves out, next oldest moves in.. if she still loves the Disney princesses she\u2019ll have even more room.", "It has nothing to do with Jude not being my child. Jude is my child just not biologically. We have father son time.  I love him like my own", "Your girlfriend seems to disagree.  She thinks you\u2019re excluding him.  Is it possible you think you\u2019re making an effort but also subconsciously doing things that favor Maddie?", "I literally assistantly coached Jude whole football team. Maddie is younger so she enjoys more one on one time. Jude rather sits in his room and play his PlayStation. I do play games with him on the system at times I can.", "That doesn\u2019t change the questions I\u2019m asking that you\u2019re avoiding. At some point, Maddie\u2019s not going to have princess tents and boxes and boxes of toys.  But you\u2019re gonna let her keep the big room, even though she doesn\u2019t need it anymore.  Because at that point it\u2019s hers.  \n\nGiving a 5 year old the second biggest room so she can put up all her princess tents at the same time is ridiculous.  Because she doesn\u2019t more than one up at once.  Jude could get the big room and set up a nice video game space - for when you go play with him.  \n\nIt\u2019s clear you\u2019re here to fight and not take advice or a judgment.  You\u2019re refusing to take everyone\u2019s advice of ask Jude, and you\u2019re arguing with the people who are you calling you the asshole.\n\nAsk your girlfriend to clarify - why would Jude feel excluded if you included him in the decision making process.  It makes no sense.  Either you made it up to save face, or she hasn\u2019t thought it through clearly."]}
