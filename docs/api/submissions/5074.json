Maybe! The thing about parents is that families of all types come with baggage. I was raised by hetero parents who actively hated each other, and that sucked. (Also, my mom is not feminine, and I am, and so I faced those same issues). I am also a woman who is in a relationship with another woman, so I totally get how some aspects of my life would be easier if I were in a hetero relationship, but the most important areas wouldn\u2019t be any easier, and I bet it\u2019s the same with your dads. \n\nThe next step is to work with your dads on how you can get the things you feel like you aren\u2019t getting from them. It sounds like you are now in a good school situation, so that\u2019s a good thing! Your new schoolmates, if they aren\u2019t bullies, are the kind of people you want to be friends with.\n\nDo your dads have within their friend community people who can be stand ins for the mother type figure you are wanting- or grandparent figures, for that matter? The friend communities that spring up out of queer communities having to make chosen families- because of exactly the type of disownment your dads experienced- can be some of the most supportive groups.\n\nAt the end of the day, you have two dads who love you, and who I bet will be happy to support you in getting what you need to be a happy, well adjusted adult. Be open with them, be sure they know how much you love them, and work with them.", "NAH. They sound like great guys. You need someone to to talk with about feminine stuff. Telling you to talk to your friends is not dealing with it. Maybe you can reach out to one of your friends mothers or older sister.", "NAH It\u2019s ok to feel the way you do. You realise you\u2019ve got good parents but wish you had more in common. Sadly, we can\u2019t make our parents fit our expectations as their unique people too - male or female.

It can be an aunt or friend who can help with makeup and such. It sounds like you are missing that person in your sphere that you can connect with and talk to about those things. That said, your dads sound pretty great. Rather than trying to subtract one of them, add a person.", "You have two parents who love you. You don't understand how lucky you are.", "NAH. I\u2019m a gay father and husband, the situation you\u2019ve described is one of my biggest fears for when my children get older.\n\nYour feelings and needs are completely valid, not to mention understandable, given your family dynamic. That said, your situation is not unique, there are kids being raised by a single father, some with toxic/uninvolved parents , while some others have no parents whatsoever. You are fortunate to have both parents who love and care about you. Parents who experienced hardship, faced adversity and went through emotional turmoil to bring you into this world, not to mention just live their lives. Something I think you should keep in mind. \n\nTelling them that your life would have been easier had they been a heterosexual couple was hurtful, and not true. Asides from what I stated above, not every heterosexual family is healthy or functional, there are plenty of examples of that all over Reddit. You have no idea if life would have been better with a mother, it could very well have been significantly worse. This isn\u2019t to make you feel like your need for a mother figure is wrong, but to give you some perspective. \n\nYou should probably have a good talk with both of them. Apologize for hurting them, explain that you love and appreciate them. Then explain that you have needs that aren\u2019t being met, that you feel invalidated and dismissed by them when you\u2019ve tried bringing it up, that you need their support in this stage of your life.

I feel like people are hearing \u201ctwo dads\u201d and automatically making them into warm amazing fathers and OP some sort of bigot.

However they have a child craving  a feminine or female influence. OPs dads are responsible for filling in the gaps, which could be done by both finding her female mentorship and not acting so \u201cgendered\u201d themselves and rendering everything she needs as female concerns that are beyond them. Plenty of single dads learn to do their daughters hair and teach them sewing and art or whatever \u201cgirly\u201d things they are into. This is a two parent household that surely should be able to do at least that much!", "A gentle YTA. You have 2 parents who love you and you're so lucky for that, but you kinda spit in their faces when you told them that you wish you had hetero parents instead. I know the grass is always greener, but I can tell you from personal experience that even if you had a mother there's no guarantee she'd share your interests or that you'd be close. I do think it's ok to want an older female figure to spend time with, so I'd suggest seeing if your community has any sort of mentorship program, like big brothers/big sisters. I had my own \"big sister\" when my single dad signed me up for the program so I'd have an older girl/woman to spend time with. I actually had 2 different ones over the years and they were both wonderful and it was a great experience.", "im gonna say yta on this, but very very softly. I know the feeling of not having a female role model, as i lost my mother when i was very young, and was raised by my very masculine father too. He was always into cars and wars and all those other masc things i just don't get bc they aren't my interests. I wouldn't say im feminine, as i am Nb and i am very artsy, but i understand the feeling of missing something that just isn't there, and feeling isolated. However, your dads seem to love you very, very much, and it must have really hurt their feelings to feel like they weren't enough, when they are trying. i know my dad would have felt devestated if i told him he wasn't doing a good enough job when he's the only support i had.\n\nI think the best thing to do is say you're sorry and you weren't trying to be mean or hurt them. Remind them that having them in your life is the best thing that could have happened to you, bc trust me, having two loving parents is a lot more than most these days, especialy when they moved you away from toxic enviroments when you were getting bullied, thats a lot of effort for your comfort! Just make sure to tell them that when you said that you wished you had a female role model, its not that you wanted them gone, but just that you wanted a deeper connection, and for them to care about your interests too. That you wanted something in common bc you were feeling loney. \n\nif they can't get into your interests, either try and find new interests *together,* or ask them to find a female they trust for you to talk to. Also teachers can be good friends! i know it sounds lame to be friend with teachers, but i also know when i was missing my mum the most, my female teachers were absolute superstars and made me feel like i had never lost anything at all.", "NAH\nBeing a teenager is hard and the world is sadly not a kind place for rainbow families yet.\nI think your dads can make an effort in showing interest in the things you like. That's part of parenting, regardless of gender. Like I (f) am a professional couch potato and one of daughters is really into sports, so during the last years I've learned a lot about gymnastics and cheerleading.\nAnd maybe there is a female friend who could take you under her wing?

They play rugby and change tires.\n\nYou are conflating things. nah", "Darling, I'm not going to call you an asshole but also.... your parents interests were never very likely to match yours. Because they're adults and you are a child. And there are plenty of moms out there that you could have had that wouldn't be this fantasy that you're harboring- and I don't just mean in the 'there are plenty of children abused by their mothers' by, but in the- if I had a feminine child, I'd have no way to relate to them. I wasn't a feminine little girl, and I didn't grow up to be a feminine woman. I certainly didn't get a 'womanhood' relationship with my own mother either. \n\nTo offer a reframe to why they might be acting a little differently today:\n\nHow would you feel if they told you that they wished they'd had a son, since apparently gender is the thing that makes people the same? It'd feel crummy. and it'd be way worse of them to do because again- adults versus child.\n\nI'd also try to reframe the relationship they have with their families- as the other person's fault. Framing it as 'if you guys were straight, we'd be fine' instead of 'if they weren't bigots' is gross. You've also almost definitely romanticized the idea of what having those adults in your life would be like- not having them there isn't a walk in the park, but at least in the circles I grew up in, it would have been preferred. I know more people than not who have gone low to no contact with their extended families because of how terrible they were. \n\nI do hope this conversation has made your dads aware that you need some more feminine role models in your life- you deserve that connection. It's also something you can try to seek out now that you're a teen.", "100% NTA. It's not good to have kids if you're a gay couple for this reason.. Try seeking therapy, it can help a shit ton. I wish you the best!", "Y a major AH. You will never understand the stigma and hatred they have endured, you should be proud of them. They adopted you out of the kindness of their heart and you respond with insecurity and selfishness.", "YTA you get what you get and you don't get upset. Especially in your case, where you have TWO parents who love you for you. What I'd do to have at least one father in my life. Grow up. I know I didn't blame my mom for not being a manly man at 14, or literally any age before that. Not giving pity for having little maturity. \n\nI was often an example of comparison whenever parents tried showing their kids how lucky they were to have 2, or usually 4 parents that care about them greatly. Every family has their issues, but yours are not the fault of your dad's, get that through your head. You guys don't have a ton in common, so what? Are they not allowed to be men? Go find a woman, or any female that's older than you that you DO have stuff in common with and spend time with them bonding, doing the things that interest you. Blaming your dad's for having their own interests and not doing a 180 on them to make you feel better, isn't doing anyone any good. Seek therapy if this is that much of an issue.", "You\u2019re 14 so I\u2019m not gunna say YTA, but please be aware these having a mother doesn\u2019t guarantee anything. I also grew up without grandparents and my mum isn\u2019t at all feminine, and very resistant to me being so. \n\nYou\u2019ll be ok with this as you get older. Be open about how you feel, talk to a therapist. Talk to other people with similar issues. Seek out mentor relationships with other women - teachers, peers moms/aunts/older siblings, friends of your fathers. \n\nIt\u2019s gunna be ok", "honestly? i wouldnt call you an asshole, but you definitely suck. most of the time same sex couples will be told that they won\u2019t be proper parents bc they won\u2019t have the other sex parent for the child, and you just confirmed that to them. would it be any different if you had a masculine mom with a masculine dad?", "OP, this is really great you should read this comment! NAH", "Top comment material. Great advice.", "No she expressed much appreciation for her parents it's feminine advice she needs and they can't help or figure anything out without communication. It's the same as single moms getting their brothers/dad's to help teach their sons things they can't.", "This 100% this.", "I get OP feeling, but what she said to her parents is just horrible. After they were discriminated by they families and other person, hearing that from their own daughter should be one of their worse nightmares. There are tons of persons  raised by single parents without a mother or parent figures. Also there are tons of child's that doesn't share interest and personalities with their parents.  OP choose the worse and hurtful way posible to address her concerns with their parents she is TA.", "I absolutely agree that what she did and how she approached it was wrong.\n\nOP was rude (like a lot of teenagers are) and an AH to the people that love her.\n\nThat being said OP has problems and should address them correctly, not like she did. Her parents are also a little AH in this situation imo. \n\nFirst because they respond to their daughters interests with \"go talk to your friends about it\". Most children would like to have a relationship with their parents and that they show they care (even if they don't). This is part of the emotional connection and well-being of the child. \n\nSecond because they are not dealing with her being an AH correctly. Giving a kid the cold-shoulder is never the right choice and they are adults. They need to communicate better with their kid because this will probably lead to more emotional disconnect and feeling as if she isn't heard. \n\nThey should have a serious talk and maybe even go to family therapy.", "So that the point of her post. We can always look at people who don\u2019t have. But telling a 14 year to get feminine advice from her friends ( assume 14/15 years old) is crazy. That a the blind leading the blind. They should set her up with a close female friend or some female they trust to navigate her through young woman hood. So she is an A for feeling she is missing something.", "A child isn\u2019t responsible for the guilt of having her parents disowned. They have a girl and as parents have neglected providing her with any feminine bonding. They should\u2019ve realized if neither one of them was going to make the attempt to fill part of that role then they could\u2019ve made the effort of finding a woman friend or possibly a decent cousin.  \n\nGay couples can fulfill the feminine or masculine bonding they see their child might need but these men didn\u2019t think about it. They can do better or act hurt and make it worse by ignoring her and her feelings.", "Yes I feel like we live in a society where family with a mother and father is still very promoted. So it's not surprising for her to feel that way.", ">most adults don\u2019t allow those thoughts to fester\n\nYou're an AH, she's 14, hardly an adult", "Yeah but this doesn't seem like the real problem here does it? OP isn't mad her dads are feminine.", "But her dads aren't feminine.  That's the problem she's having here.", "With all due respect, that is not the issue being addressed here. Nobody is saying that dad's *can't* be feminine, OP's dad's just aren't.\n\nThe issue is that op feels like she can't relate to either of her parents, which is a pretty normal thing for teenagers to experience imo\n\nStill a slight YTA for the way she addressed it with them, but she's just a kid and teenagers are often like that.", "Would you say the same thing about a single dad raising a daughter?", "This. They both love you, but they are to selfish to realize, that they are robbing you and making your life hard in adding.", "She\u2019s old enough to know not to be cruel to the people that love her the most."]}
