It was mainly a couple event at a sushi restaurant my girl loves. My friend Mike just entered a relationship and I asked him to bring his girlfriend. He gets back to me a few days later explaining that his new girlfriend doesn\u2019t like sushi but she\u2019d be happy about eating anywhere else. I said that\u2019s fine don\u2019t come. Mike said he\u2019ll talk to her again but I explained to Mike him and her are no longer invited since you already tried to change the restaurant just because your new girlfriend does like it. He tries arguing with me that he wants to come because it\u2019s the first time she\u2019s been invited to the friend group. I repeated that they are no longer invited because it\u2019s my girlfriend\u2019s birthday and I don\u2019t want any drama. Mike tried to say there wouldn\u2019t be but I told him his new girlfriend was already acting like a diva at someone else\u2019s party so that\u2019s why she\u2019s not going. He tried saying she just didn\u2019t like sushi and I said that\u2019s ok you don\u2019t have to take her to a sushi restaurant for her birthday but we are still going for my girlfriend\u2019s birthday and you guys are no longer invited. Mike called me a dick and told the other couples who was going about how disrespectful I\u2019m being to his girlfriend over this and he just wanted her to feel comfortable with everyone.", "created_utc": 1687650230, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14i75x4/aita_for_disinviting_a_friend_to_dinner/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You could have just said that the invitation was for sushi, and that that wouldn't change, but instead you escalated.", "YTA - As the new girlfriend, it was an innocent remark that she doesn't like sushi. I would have said the same thing. Mike was the one to suggest a different restaurant. They should be allowed to come if they still want to.", "YTA. What a bizarre overreaction. The only cause of drama is you. It sounds like they just weren\u2019t sure if you were all that attached to the specific restaurant so thought it would be worth saying that she\u2019ll come if it happens to be a different place. It\u2019s not like he pushed back at all when you declined to change it, so uninviting them both completely was totally unnecessary. And very rude of you to call his girlfriend a diva when you haven\u2019t even met her, for all you know she didn\u2019t suggest changing the restaurant at all and that was all Mike\u2019s idea.\n\nYou are the epitome of a person who \u2018hates drama!\u2019 yet somehow is constantly creating it.", "Info:  what led you straight to uninviting them?  Is it normal for your friend group to have this kind of drama?  New girlfriend sounds entitled but that seems like an excessive reaction.", "YTA. I think you seriously overreacted by I inviting Mike. All he did was ask if a different restaurant could be picked. He didn\u2019t insist that you change it, he didn\u2019t say he wouldn\u2019t come if you didn\u2019t.  All he did was ask and you immediately uninvited him because of that. There\u2019s nothing wrong with him asking just to see if it would be possible. If he made a stink about you saying no then that\u2019s when you should\u2019ve uninvited him but just because he asked? Really?", "You just blew the situation way out of proportion. You could\u2019ve had a civilized conversation but you went straight to uninviting them and causing a lot more drama than what was necessary. YTA.", "This is a really weird situation caused not by Mike's question but by your extreme and rigid overreaction to it. You jumped to the strangest, most unwarranted reaction possible. I wonder if there is something causing you to behave like this? It's not other people, it's definitely you. At some point you may find yourself losing friends if you don't do some serious self analysis and change how you perceive and react to others. Strong YTA.", "YTA. Why don't you let Mike decide if he wants to come?", "YTA. Your overreaction to Mike and your response to commenters here make it very clear you are unpleasant to deal with.", "YTA. \n\nAsking for a different restaurant is not being dramatic. You uninviting them due to that request (which was not a demand) was dramatic and rude.\n\nMike's words and actions afterwards may have been immature, but they weren't unwarranted.", "Yta, you seem a little unhinged actually, he was  just checking and you completely overreacted\u2026 are you ok bro ?", "YTA\n\nMost japanese places have ample non fish options  if it's an allergy thing", "YTA you really over reacted by rescinding.", "YTA. I agree that you should go where your girlfriend wants for her birthday, good moral stance OP.\nHowever, the manner in which you ininvited your friend was to cold and 'disrespectful'.", "YTA. For someone who doesn\u2019t like drama you sure cause it. Sure, it was entitled to even ask to move the restaurant, but your reaction was beyond ott. Just say \u2018no, mate, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going. You can pick some other time\u2019. Sounds like he\u2019s not been invited before cos you\u2019re gatekeeping \u2018couples only\u2019 (which is pathetic anyway) but maybe you just don\u2019t like him", "YTA and the only diva here lmfao", "YTA. You unnecessarily escalated the situation. The only person that is causing drama in this situation is you. Why is it so hard just say \u2018this is the restaurant my girlfriend wants to go to. If you don\u2019t want to go, that\u2019s fine\u2019. It\u2019s not that hard. Uninviting them and insulting his girlfriend is a crazy overreaction.", "Wow, what an overreaction. YTA.", "YTA.

Mike should not have suggested a new restaurant, but your reaction seems outsized. Do you even like Mike?", "ESH - Ya she was the AH for even suggesting they change restaurants for her, when it's your gf Bday. Mike is the AH for thinking this something that he should even mention to you. But you the AH cause my god dude, your like \"I don't like drama\" then go from 0 to 100... You immediately disinvite them? You could have at least let Mike talk to her. It seems like it's still early, and he doesn't know when to say no to her yet. Like could you have made a worse possible first impression on her...\n\nAgain you ain't wrong for standing firm on the restaurant, but you can still be right and be a colossal AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If Mike protested or got mad once you said no to changing the restaurant, then you wouldn\u2019t be an AH, but it sounded like Mike was okay with letting the girlfriend know that the group would still be going to a sushi restaurant. So I\u2019m not sure why you decided to uninvite him as well.", "yta\u2026 this seems like an extreme reaction", "NTA to me.  You issued a SPECIFIC invitation to a specific type of food, you did not ask for suggestions.\n\nI\u2019m glad you stood your ground.", "INFO: Who is paying? I\u2019m happy to come to the party at the sushi restaurant even if I hate the food.

I do not think this was an over reaction by disinviting them, given this is a girl he\u2019s never met letting him know she doesn\u2019t like the restaurant choice.

I mean I get that the Mike gf had a bad reactions, she is invited for the 1 time on a birthday of someone she doesn't know of her bf friends group and ask to change restaurant. Yep, it is entitled. But you could have taken it differently, telling Mike it is ok if she doesn't come, we'll meet her on another occasion, but that day is my girl birthday, so it is about her and what she likes, so I won't change restaurant. And leave it at that. Tell Mike he is welcome to come, and because of the sushi thing it will be better to meet new gf a different day.", "ESH - Mike\u2019s new girlfriend is very entitled, and the fact that he even came to you and said that she\u2019d be willing to come if you change the location of the birthday dinner is preposterous. She\u2019s entitled and he\u2019s an enabler. I understand you wanting to put a stop to it since it is your girlfriends birthday, but please try to handle things like this with a little bit more tact. It\u2019ll work out better in the end for you because now you just look like a straight up asshole. You\u2019re not wrong, but you didn\u2019t handle it well. You don\u2019t want people in your friend group to think that your unreasonable or reactive to any little thing; people won\u2019t want to be around you!", "Yikes, ESH", "YTA.  \n\nHe offered an alternative and when you said no he said he'd talk to his GF about it and you noped out of that friendship. \n\nHow about give him the chance to point out that every sushi restaurant has non sushi options. \n\nWhat a weird reaction. Say bye to that friendship, if he had any sense at all.", "YTA. You come on really strong and punitive. You could just say you are still going to sushi.", "NTA. If she wants to feel comfortable with everyone, she shouldn't ask that she get to choose the restaurant she likes for the birthday of someone she hasn't met.", "Ooh boy, YTA. You also seem to have a massive problem with women and single people in general. Why invite only couples? Why not ask your friend to come alone if his new girlfriend doesn't like sushi? Why disinvite them when most Japanese restaurants in the Western world offer things like tempura and teriyaki chicken? You sound like a middle American who's trying to look classy by shitting on someone who has an aversion to sushi but thinks they're hot shit for eating California rolls.", "NTA - Someone trying to change the location of the BIRTHDAY dinner is rude as all get out.  Sushi is probably a treat for your GF and what she wants for her birthday. I cannot even imagine trying to change the location of someone\u2019s bd dinner because I didn\u2019t know how to look at a menu online and see that most sushi places offer ::gasp:: other things to eat.\n\nNTA but your friend is ignoring obvious red flags", "Or the OP could have asked Mike to look over the menu and see if there was something there the girlfriend would eat.", "That\u2019s not what the post says. It\u2019s says the gf said she\u2019d be happy eating somewhere else. That sounds entitled to me, especially being the first time meeting the friend group.", "This!   Poor girlfriend may have  had no idea. Plus don't most sushi places do Japanese salads she could have eaten given the chance.", "This!", "I don\u2019t want the entitlement of someone\u2019s drama on my girlfriend\u2019s birthday. I mean who else tries to make somebody else\u2019s birthday dinner about them especially people you have never met. I don\u2019t want that vibe at dinner because who knows if she\u2019ll try to make it all about her.", "It\u2019s not his party", "Isn't requesting a different restaurant for someone's BIRTHDAY celebration rude,  though?

I think OP overreacted and made it a bigger deal than it needed to be. But it\u2019s definitely weird that Mike and New gf thought that OP wanted input and that this BIRTHDAY dinner was meant to accommodate the wants of someone none of them have ever even met. I think they just had a bit of an \u201cout of touch\u201d moment, which happens to the best of us.\n\nI can kinda empathize with OP\u2019s annoyance, especially at the \u201cshe\u2019d be happy eating anywhere else\u201d comment, but I think the one who remains polite and level-headed comes out of the situation more dignified. \n\nIf I were OP, I probably would have said, \u201cThis dinner is for my gf, so we are eating where she\u2019d like.

I would never ask to change the restaurant someone picked for their birthday dinner, especially if I didn\u2019t even know anyone. I think the girlfriend is very entitled.
