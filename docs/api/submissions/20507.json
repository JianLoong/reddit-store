Oh and the drama was created by you.", "Had a hard time with this one because on one hand it is totally rude to expect someone you haven't even met to change the restraunt they're celebrating their birthday at. One the other hand you went straight to the nuclear option instead of either looking at the menu or just saying if she doesn't like sushi then she could come along some other time. You uninvited both the girlfriend and your friend immediately without even asking your girlfriend what HER opinion is of the situation.

The same loyalty you feel towards your new girlfriend over this matter is how I feel about (gf name).

There's nothing that comes across as entitled here.", "I don\u2019t necessarily think it is, but it really depends on the tone and delivery.

I'm not allergic, but my mom and sister are so I didn't eat it growing up. Seafood smells absolutely revolting to me.

And many even offer steak, chicken breast, broiled salmon, and even cheeseburgers. My husband doesn't care for sushi. And hasn't starved.", "Yes yum tempura is fabulous", "Honestly, asking the restaurant be changed is rude. Especially since it's for someone that none of them know and is not significant to birthday girl. If it was just a random get together with their friends it wouldn't be rude, however that's not the case.", "No, it's insanely rude to even ask that. If you don't like it so much, just decline the invitation. Otherwise just look up the menu and find something you'll be okay with, for example in this case it would probably be vegetarian sushi.", "Yeah most places have something a person can eat if they don't like the main thing the restaurant is for. Like a steak place will have salad and bread if nothing else. Or at a sushi place they have rice and soups, often salads too. And if I didn't like Mexican rather than having a terrible allergy I'd just eat chips. Or like a cheese quesadilla. Unless you are vegan or dealing with allergies, there should always be something you can eat. It might not be a full meal, but you can still be social and nibble, then get something after if you didn't eat before coming.", "You seem to be making it about you and your drama with your friend.

Mike sounds like he was asking just to see if they were dead set on that specific restaurant he didn\u2019t go on a whole rant saying how unacceptable it was that they weren\u2019t accommodating his girlfriends tastebuds. He simply said he\u2019d talk to her again and if she didn\u2019t want to come he prob would\u2019ve chosen to go by himself or not at all, but OP completely overreacted in this situation where no one was being rude.

That's the only place I've heard \"capsicum\" instead of \"capsaicin.\" \n\nBut yeah I have the same issue with a lot of Asian restaurants because they don't realize a lot of their vegetables are on the same family as chilis and such. So I say I'm allergic to peppers and even if I go into detail they just assume I mean spicy stuff. I actually spent one birthday in the hospital because I didn't taste the bell peppers until I actually had one on my fork. They were under all the meat and I thought the bits of green poking through were zucchini or something. I ended up having to call a taxi to take me to the hospital but joking that it still wasn't my worst birthday!", "Actually I'm in Australia,  they called capsicum here but it is the capsaicin family. UK calls them peppers as well I think. \nI'm hearing you with the hidden food.   Is that a sundried tomato or a bit of red shit I can't eat? .  Luckily my husband will be a taste tester for me.
