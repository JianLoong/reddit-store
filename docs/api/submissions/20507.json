Oh and the drama was created by you.", "Had a hard time with this one because on one hand it is totally rude to expect someone you haven't even met to change the restraunt they're celebrating their birthday at. One the other hand you went straight to the nuclear option instead of either looking at the menu or just saying if she doesn't like sushi then she could come along some other time.

So Mike tells gf about the invite and where they are going. She then mentions that she doesn't like sushi. She might have asked if they could go somewhere else, but it sounds like it was Mike that mentioned it. The gf wasn't even in this particular conversation at all. It was just OP and Mike. And even if the gf DID ask, I don't see the harm in simply asking. Mike's gf has no idea how important sushi is to OP's gf. She may not even know who picked that place or that it is even for a birthday. The OP's immediate answer was, don't come. All he had to say was, \"It means a lot to gf to eat at this place. We're not changing the venue. If you're gf can't find something on the menu to eat, then we can just meet her another time.\" He didn't give them any time to mull it over.

Did you mention that sushi is a sacred choice they should not question? \n\nBecause if you didn''t tell them in advance how important it is to go to sushi place, and then still jumped into your ridiculous overreaction, you really seriously need to work on your communication skills and grow up.

It\u2019s her first time meeting us, on my girlfriends birthday, where we chose the venue because she (the birthday girl) likes it, and they\u2019re asking to change the venue? No. I would be worried if they have that bad of manners, that this is the kind of person who if she does show up is gonna sit there and make a lot of faces and act like she\u2019s so put out because she doesn\u2019t like sushi and it\u2019s going to totally kill the mood. Fuck all that. I wouldn\u2019t want someone at my girlfriend\u2019s birthday party who wasn\u2019t mature enough to know that you don\u2019t ask to change the venue, especially with a group of people you\u2019ve never even met. What the hell. That said, it\u2019s not clear whether the girlfriend wanted to ask to have the venue changed (I can see many girlfriends being told \u201cI asked my buddy if we could go somewhere else\u201d and the girlfriend being horrified he did that) or whether Mike was too much of a doofus to know that this is not only not good etiquette, it\u2019s straight up +horrible* etiquette. \n\nHOWEVER, the people saying that it was a massive overreaction are not exactly wrong. There\u2019s ways to say, \u201chonestly, if she doesn\u2019t like sushi, this really isn\u2019t the best time for her to meet all of us. This is Jane\u2018s birthday and I really want the focus to be on her and everything to be chill, so let\u2019s do another occasion where we all meet your girlfriend\u201c without basically getting angry and aggressive (at least that\u2019s how OP sounds in his description) at this dude for not respecting party etiquette very well.

Etiquette states that when Invited to a Celebration, you DO NOT Squabble about WHERE It\u2019s being held, Nor do you Try to CHANGE the Venue because YOUR GF Doesn\u2019t like the Food being served. You either Accept, or Decline. Where on earth did you ppl learn your Manners from???", "Then either eat beforehand/afterwards or don't go? It isn't her birthday. You don't change other people's birthday plans.", "Honestly, we don\u2019t even know the girlfriend knew it was a birthday dinner or what she said.

She did tell me that if I wasn\u2019t open to it it was perfectly fine, and that she would celebrate with me at a later date. There was no animosity, I didn\u2019t think it was rude, and I was happy she spoke up because I had completely spaced and forgot about her allergy. I wanted her there, and picked another place I really liked that could accommodate her. I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with asking. Worst someone can say in response is \u201cno\u201d and then that\u2019s your answer.

He uninvited Mike's gf because she demanded the restaurant be changed.\n\nMy comment to this one: that was a demand, a passive aggressive one but a demand all the same. What they did was back-pedaling because they expected OP to do what they wanted. And if OP is inviting people that should mean he is hosting and should be able to uninvite people. I don't think OP's gf would care all that much about someone she doesn't know not coming.", "Well, he has one less friend, a few other friends reconsidering their options, and the girlfriend is about to find out that her choice of a birthday restaurant has caused a rift in the group through no fault of her own.", "OP: hey it\u2019s my gf\u2019s birthday.

OP: NTA.", "Maybe she only said she didn't like sushi. He asking to change, not her. We don't know what she wanted", "Nah, if I am invited to a friend of a friend's birthday celebration, I don't ask to change the venue. Especially if I don't know them. That's just narcissistic.", "I\u2019m also wondering how the other friends feel after OP decided to uninvite them. She made this dumb decision for everyone.

It\u2019s too much r/imthemaincharacter \n\nThe thought process(es) that lead to asking is the same one being used at the dinner. Who knows what other social faux pas they\u2019ll have. He didn\u2019t want to risk drama at the dinner. And closed the door to it. \n\nAs someone who could\u2019ve avoided drama myself I\u2019d I just saw a red flag earlier, I can\u2019t fault him for this.", "So, it is better to be passive aggressive than open and direct, what are you? American?", "Alternative to a birthday invitation, can you be more entitled?", "Even if she didn't like sushi, you shouldn't say it to someone you've never met directly and just show up, tough it up and maybe see something else on the menu they can eat like?", "Because asking for a venue change for an event you don't even know the host is rude and entitled, and a huge red flag.\n\nIf Mike came alone he would be resentful, bc his gf was excluded.\n\nThe problem is not the menu, it's entitlement.\n\nOoh boy indeed, couples and singles have very much different interests and topics, and if you are an only couple or an only single person, it can be really tiring. \n\nSo, you avoid the drama by doing two separate events, or by cutting the losses.", "And asking for a venue change for a birthday from a host you don't even know is... entitled at least, a big red flag, and you don't want to have that at a birthday party", "Why tell the OP at all then? What did they expect? The dinner IS still happening there, nothing has changed. The boyfriend/girlfriend could have presented a solution, not a problem - we can't come because she doesn't like sushi, we can come but will be ordering something else, we'll join you afterwards for dessert. Don't just dump a problem in the OP's lap and be surprised when he solves it in a sharp, easy way.", "Either way, the only solution is to uninvite both...\n\nIt's not the mention of aversion to sushi, it is an aversion to entitlement.", "Best response on the side of being NTA for OP.", "Mike would be resentful because his gf was not there, and fifth wheel... spoiling the birthday", "You can't go too nuclear, any amount of nuclear is nuclear amount of nuclear.\n\nYou can go too quickly, but think about it:\n\n1) gf doesn't go, Mike is resentful, spoiled birthday\n2) gf does go, gf is resentful, and entitled enough to ask a stranger to change birthday venues, nuclear birthday\n3) they both don't go, happy birthday!", "Yes! OP blew up disproportionately to the casual conversation of \"alright since it's still sushi I'll have a chat with her\" YTA for just being so rigidly defensive, OP. It wasn't a serious conversation for Mike and his GF, it was mostly casual dinner plans with a friend group. Could have politely reiterated just \"this is my partners choice for her birthday\" but you chose the most inflexible and a pretty dramatic way of reacting to what you perceived as something rude by a fellow you've known for a long time! Not everything is absolutes, think about their perspective beyond \"eugh entitlement from a woman I haven't ever met\" and apologize.\nYou are losing a friend over a casual suggestion they made, wanting to accommodate a new gf. He is also in a new stage of his life. Be considerate! Empathize with your friends, dude, it's a skill.", "You are completely correct!\n\nSo, Mike should have been uninvited, and his gf should definitely come.\n\nMight be a bit awkward, but damn, drama averted!", "this doesn't read that way to me. it reads that OP said \"sushi or you're not invited\" and Mike said, \"let me ask her again\" and OP just immediately escalated to \"no you and your selfish gf aren't invited anymore!!!\"", "Going to mildly disagree. Depending on friend group, it may be a place they semi regularly go in a rotation of a few spots. We also don't know how plans have been worded. 'Thinking of doing x and then y' vs 'we are going to Restaurant at Time.' We also don't know if he either A) knows she hates that place or B) has an allergy he's aware of and he said it for her without asking.\n\nThe overreaction was over the top. He didn't say, 'we're getting sushi so we'll catch you another time. He totally uninvited. That's way over the top.", "No, you go to the place of choice of the person whose birthday is. They do not have to change their preferred choice because one person doesn\u2019t like it.", "Pleased to find this, as so many seem to be jumping in with \"new girlfriend trying to hijack everything\". \"Definitely doing sushi\" was the right answer, and up to the others if they still want to go.", "No, what\u2019s insane is someone who is basically a stranger telling them to change the restaurant choice. That\u2019s fricking rude.", "Mike sounds like a whip cracked before he called his friend to ask they change all their plans because his new GF whined she dun liek sushi but he's getting laid so it causes stupid things to come out of his mouth. We've all been there, but saying they need to change the venue for them to go is all sorts of Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.", "There's no way this hasn't done irreperable damage to OP and Mike's relationship. If I were Mike and knew OP wasn't going through some shit, then I'd be out. Pleasant in group interactions but we wouldn't be friends.", "Yeah I feel like I\u2019m going crazy, why does everyone think it\u2019s appropriate for a new girlfriend who is invited to A BIRTHDAY DINNER for someone to ask for them to change the restaurant? This is for someone\u2019s birthday, it\u2019s your first time meeting these people, it is not about you. That\u2019s really wild.

Besides, we don\u2019t even know exactly how the conversation between Mike and his girlfriend went. She might not even realize that this is someone\u2019s birthday dinner, and that changes things quite a bit if so. I personally think Mike probably shouldn\u2019t have asked (at least barring any other potential missing information here, like allergies), but since he was obviously willing to back off immediately when the answer was no, that should\u2019ve been the end of it. Asking was probably a bit of a faux pas, but OP didn\u2019t need to go to extremes \u2014 he\u2019s the one getting the drama going.", "I still don\u2019t understand why OP didn\u2019t just say, that\u2019s cool, come alone. Why it\u2019s some stupid couples only thing that you\u2019d disinvite a friend over.", "What is the girlfriend supposed to say then? What she said sounds like a diplomatic, polite way of declining. In a world where OP is a reasonable person and doesn't grossly overreact, he says, \"Sorry, we're already committed to getting sushi. Maybe next time!\" and that's that.", "Yeah, because you ask for every personal preference when you are deciding where you want to go to celebrate your birthday.", "Am I misunderstanding something? How do you interact with people if you see such an inoffensive statement as passive aggression? \n\n\nYou can be open and direct, yet not get into a fight over every little thing. Saying that you're sticking to your plans and giving friends the choice to come, *is* being open and direct without the added hostility of OP's actions.", "Yeah. You can. \n\nFriend didn't demand, he asked. It was a couples only party. He didn't say he wouldn't come, he ASKED. Friend didn't demand, he ASKED. And when told no, he said he'd get back to him and OO  said *nope,  don't bother, out you go*", "Exactly. He spoke to Mike, not to the girlfriend. We don't know what she said. We know she doesn't like sushi and we know she's willing to go anyway. We know Mike asked if the restaurant could be changed, we don't know if that was her idea or his.", "Except she's not. It's more of an implication, but they're NOT demanding or asking to go to a different restaurant.", "Where did you read any of that from...\n\nThere's just entitled \"My gf doesn't like sushi, we will come if you change places\"\n\nThe response \"Ok, you will not come\" was on point", "As far as we and the op know, the gf did jack shit. \n\nMike asked op if they can change venues, as far as we know gf may have just said offhand \n\n-Too bad it's sushi, I can't stand the smell, I like almost anything else\n\n- Damn can't go. I'm allergic \n\n- I'd go if it were anything else. Next time, maybe\n\nWe don't have enough info to call her an asshole only Mike and op", "Except... She didn't ask for anything. He talked to Mike, remember? It's all one big he-said-she-said but we are certain the new girlfriend was demanding? OP wasn't even there when Mike talked to her about it.", "OP has never even met the girlfriend or spoken to her. But you know 100% what she said and how?!? Dude. That's ridiculous.", "I concur with your points, completely. I just think OP could have a slow-rolled it a little initially. Instead, he leapt immediately to \"No soup for you!\", which let Mike come off as a sympathetic character to at least some of their friend group. Some softer pushback to start -- \"Sorry, Mike, was there some confusion as to the nature of the invitation?\" -- and OP would never have to ask AITA in the first place.", "But he didn\u2019t even give Mike the chance to ask his gf to look at the menu and see if there was something on it she would eat. OP didn\u2019t have to make this suggestion, he didn\u2019t even have to think about it, but he also didn\u2019t have to go nuclear with no chance for consultation or anything, now his gf **and** Mike are completely uninvited. According to OP he\u2019s never met the gf before, he has no idea if she\u2019s going to cause drama or not. Really disliking sushi is no indication that she will be dramatic. \n\nHonestly, the only overly dramatic person I see here is OP", "i'm glad my friends don't treat each other the way yours apparently do. \"not op's problem?\" i guess. that's not usually a sentence i think about when i'm dealing with my friends though", "Ok then don\u2019t come? Meet them next time when they invite her to something she would enjoy. She did worse than demand her own cake, she requested a completely different venue. That is so incredibly rude. It would have been fine if all she did was decline.", "Is it though. Who tries to change the location of someone else's birthday party to a place they want to go when they have never met any of these people and should want to make a good first impression? Now imagine that kind of person forced to go to a place she doesn't want to go and how that kind of person acts throughout the evening.\n\nThe act of showing that level of entitlement would make me not want them there at all. That's the kind of person who shows up but complains about the food and place all evening.\n\nIf someone does something weird, entitled and shitty then I'm going to not want to invite you to someone's birthday party.", "The request might have been fine if it was a random friend group outing, but it was someone\u2019s birthday, and the restaurant was the birthday girl\u2019s favorite. So asking to change the restaurant was inappropriate.\n\nThe polite thing to do would have been to look at the menu online to see if the restaurant had something the new gf would have liked. If they did, great!\n\nAnd if not, she doesn\u2019t go to dinner. She could go to dinner with her bf and meet up with the group later, or she could skip the evening altogether and just meet the group at the next get-together.", "You do not ARSK for a venue change for a birthday party of a person...\n\nShe'd be happy about eating anywhere else implies change or we are not going.\n\nSo they are not going, ok, it is not mandatory.", ">I am dumbfounded by all the \u201cAll he did was ask\u201d excuses.\n\nOn the other hand I'm amazed by the people who apparently can't have this kind of conversation with friends, and would be offended by a friend asking this question.

There's absolutely no reason Mike and his girlfriend couldn't pull up Google and peruse the menu themselves instead of asking OP to change a birthday party venue all because of one person they never met. That's rude as fuck. If this was just a casual hangout I'd say a venue request is okay, but not for things like birthdays, anniversaries, recital dinners, etc.  \n\nHonestly it's weird how many commenters weren't taught manners.  \n\nRequesting a venue change is dramatic imo.  \n\nBut I do think OP still overreacted.

Op is either the bad guy that says no, we can\u2019t change restaurant, and feeling the guilt of letting his friend down or he\u2019s the bad guy for asking the birthday girl to change restaurants for someone she\u2019s never met. Mike gets a pass either way cuz he can go back to girlfriend and say well I asked. For all we the Mike\u2019s girlfriend would be absolutely mortified to know what Mike asked. I know I would be.

We don't know what the girlfriend said, just what Mike did, and the fact that after op said no we're not changing, Mike still said I'll talk to her, I'd still like to come. That to me shows it was meant as a polite comment, not a demand. He then reacted over the top by uninviting both of them, neither were assholes, just different views.", "Did she try to change the restaurant or was he just saying that she\u2019s usually chill, but she doesn\u2019t like sushi?", "In general I agree, but it really depends on the context+delivery.\n\n\"We're thinking of going here, would you be up for that?\" / \"We'd love to come but my new GF really isn't into sushi, if there's another place we could go to that would be good.\"\n\nVs\n\n\"We've booked a table at my girlfriend's absolute favourite restaurant for her birthday...\" / \"Sally detests sushi.

But you have also literally never met the birthday girl, so you also have zero clue what it _is_ about. \n\nI like a very wide variety of foods, equally. The exact thing I eat for my birthday dinner is not important to me. Not even a teeny tiny little bit. If I invited someone to my b'day dinner, spending time with them *is* important to me - even if I have never met them before. I would much rather somebody tell me \"hey my gf, whom you asked to me invite, unfortunately can't stand sushi - but she would be happy to join if the party were elsewhere\" than say \"hey my gf said she can't come\" and give no explanations. I wouldn't have invited this gal to my b'day dinner if her presence weren't important - I am perfectly happy to have dinner at one of the tens of other favourite restaurants I have. On the other hand, if she says no without explanation, now I am overthinking what the issue is and how can I convince her to come. Can she come if I move the dinner by an hour either way? What if we do lunch instead of dinner? Does she just not want to meet us for some reason? Can I do anything to change that? Etc etc etc. \n\nOn the other hand, if I did have my heart set on the sushi, the first response still lets me say either \"oh, how about she meet us for ice cream afterwards\" or \"ah that's a shame, but I get it. We'll meet her some other time\" or any of a thousand other responses that is not \"I am so very offended that anybody would dare to voice a preference about a day where every single thought has to be centered on me and me alone, I am going disinvite anybody who may dare voice anything but perfect love and approbation of every single choice I make around my birthday\".\n\nIf you're declining an invitation from a somebody in your BF's life, it's only polite you let them know _why_ rather than making them play 20-questions to figure out what the right conditions for meeting you are?", "No. Mike said she'd be happy going somewhere else.\n\nShe hasn't been stated to have said anything at all.", "My god, thank you. I have never been so blown away by all the OP hate.

He could've just explained that his girfriend likes that restaurant/sushi, so switching venues is not an option. If the friends girlfriend wants to decline, that's fine and totally valid. If she then started to complain or demand anything of OP, then she'd be the asshole, but as it is, YTA .
