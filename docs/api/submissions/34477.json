Please keep doing what you are doing. Reassuring her, checking and letting her see you are checking and taking her seriously, giving her a fun day (because that may be the relief she needs from the pain and fear which are otherwise relentless), showing her you put her first. Your wife sounds, to me, as though she is jealous of your \u201cindulgence\u201d of your daughter; it makes me wonder if your wife had anything similar happen to her years ago, and she didn\u2019t get much care, and she now resents her daughter getting it (speculating here, of course, but trying to understand why she is so unfeeling and rigid). Glad your daughter is getting therapy. There may be some better/additional resources, if you observe she is not improving in a bit; keep talking with her about what is helping her. Sometimes therapy plus a group of peers to talk with in a facilitated chat can help; medication for a period of time can help. Also, consider sports or physical activity like hiking, swimming, etc. which can build back a sense of strength and autonomy and well-being in the body which helps the whole self. Something you could do together that she could continue through her life when she needs to build her confidence.

For now I think it\u2019s good for her to have her dad there to protect her", "If she's having active delusions she needs a lot more than a therapist.", "No offense but that\u2019s a bs excuse for how she\u2019s treating your daughter. I\u2019m sorry, you assuring your teen daughter that you\u2019ll always be there for her after she went through something horrible is *spoiling* her? Even if you said that to her in\u2026better circumstances that\u2019s a pretty normal thing for loving dads to do. \n\nYou need to get your wife under control.

Keep following your instincts to give your daughter what she needs. Hate people like your wife.", "If thinking her boyfriend is in the yard is a recurring problem, talk with her about whether having bright lights back there that she could flip on at will would help.  So if she gets that feeling he's out there, she can stay in the locked house but turn on bright flood lights and see that no one is there.\n\nIt's good that you're helping her right now, and it's also good to put mechanisms in place so she can gradually become more self reliant.\n\nSimilarly, dropping everything to spend the day with your daughter was a nice thing to do right now.  But it's not sustainable long term, so you need a plan to gradually lessen the \"after care\" after she's had a rough night and support her in helping herself.

There\u2019s a weird dynamic because you love fear a partner like that and it swirls your brain to think they could do anything \u2026. And tbh it is dangerous and when he gets out just know stupid people disregard no contact/restraining orders. So it is very possible that he could be in your backyard. \n\nI appreciate you not treating it like a joke. Stay safe", "Get one just in case. Plus it could put your daughter at ease, at least a little bit", "You are a great dad. Have you thought about motion detector lights for the back yard so she would know for sure if anyone was out there?", "Having an irrational fear as a response to PTSD is not the same as having delusions.", "\"Delusion\" is a strong word to throw around when you have absolutely no idea at all what's going on.  For all you know he really *was* in the backyard, and scarpered when OP went out.", "This happened with my eldest daughter. She ended up moving 100 miles to live with me aged 15 after her mum was blaming her for a traumatic event. She is 21 now and still doesn't talk to her mother. Its really sad. My ex has persistently doubled down though.", "If you have neighbors please ignore the bright flood light suggestion. Signed someone with a floodlight pointed at their window.", "Or rather, make sure they're aimed low - just enough to show a person in the yard, but not high enough to shine in the neighbors ' windows.  Maybe even tell the neighbors what you're doing and ask them to let you know if a light gets knocked askew and starts to bother them.", "I don\u2019t see how you can have one without the other. Light disperses in all directions. For example my neighbors light is pointed at my window but it produces enough light to light up my roommates room and that window isn\u2019t in the direct beam of light."]}
