My husband really wanted to pick out the name and we both agreed on Ezekiel Lonnie and we call him Zeke for short. It was the only name we both could agree on and I respected he wanted his first son to have Lonnie in it for his great-grandfather who basically raised him and passed before we met. Our families don't like the name at all and have made comments. But his grandma has been making it very clear she will be calling the baby Lonnie which I really don't want because we picked out this name and I have been calling the baby Zeke since we found out. Everytime we bring up baby Zeke she says \"oh you mean baby Lonnie\" and it gets a me everytime. My husband doesn't seem to care or notice at all when she says it. I don't know how to ask her without being disrespectful to her. We have had our issues before and she is getting grumpy in her age. Everything upsets her and especially when it comes to me and my pregnancy. I just don't want him called Lonnie unless we talking about his full name.

I mean, she's not going to listen and you'll probably never win the battle but NTA for trying", "NTA. It's your baby, not his grandma's. Tell your husband that this bothers you a lot and that he needs to talk to her and make sure she uses baby's actual name, and that if she doesn't, you won't feel comfortable with her being around him when he's born.", "NTA. Your husband needs to wake up to the microaggressions of his gma. He needs to back you up and you both need to tell her she needs to address your child by his given name or she forfeits her ability to see the child. Real talk, greatgrandparents dont typically last very long in a childs life. Mine were gone before i was 10 and i was lucky i even had any to meet to begin with. If she wants the privilege of knowing her greatgrandchild personally,  she needs to earn it by respecting your child with their correct name.", "NTA but it's not the grandmother you have to talk to.\n\nYou need to talk to your *husband*. You two are a family, so you should show unity among relatives. You need to let your husband know how much this bothers you, and *he* needs to be the one that talks to grandma. It's the only way this will work.\n\nIf you talk to grandma directly, she won't listen. You'll just make her resent you even more. If her beloved grandson talks to her, even if she isn't happy with the request, she'll oblige as a favour to the grandson.", "NTA but why did you make that part of his name if you don\u2019t want people to call him that", "NTA. Start calling her by her name as long as you aren't already or by her middle name. She'll give you that 'respect your elders' crap so tell her 'if you want to disrespect my son's name, I will disrespect yours'. Sometimes fire needs to be fought with fire. You will catch hell about it, but sometimes you need to play their game against them.", "I get the feeling that the \u201conly name you could both agree to\u201d was the only name you would agree to.", "OLD AGE ISN\u2019T A EXCUSE FOR SHITTY BEHAVIOUR\n\nNta grandmas obviously doing it out of spite as I would say she\u2019s probably mad the great-grandfathers name isn\u2019t the your baby\u2019s first name", "You are rlly arguing with an old lady about her using the boys middle name instead of first name...really?? You're not letting her win by just letting her call him Lonnie. In fact you are saving your sanity by not having petty little tiffs with an old lady 2 breaths away from seeing the lord. \n\nNta but come on, save your energy for when she ACTUALLY steps out of line.", "YTA. You agreed for Lonnie to be your child's middle name, so it's not unreasonable for someone to refer to him by that name. I understand being annoyed, especially when she \"corrects\" you, but kids often have multiple pet names given by different friends/family members. It's a bit odd to try and take that away from someone, especially a grumpy old lady who certainly won't get to use the nickname as long as you'll be using Zeke. \n\nSeems like you just don't like the name Lonnie and didn't know how to tell your husband. Would be a pretty awkward convo no matter how to try to address this...", "NAH but I think you\u2019re making a bigger deal out of this than it needs to be.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
