I was firmly on your side until you conducted a medical test without his consent. He's one for refusing to get tested, you're one for the test.  I'm amazed your doctor hasn't insisted on getting him tested before moving forward with anymore testing.", "ESH, you\u2019re both way too immature to be having any children anyway. If you aren\u2019t able to communicate on even the smallest of levels, then why are you even together?", "I\u2019ll bet five bucks if you do get pregnant by him he is going to accuse you of cheating. \n\nIt also doesn\u2019t bode well he believed uti are sexually transmitted. \n\nI don\u2019t agree with your methods but don\u2019t have a kid with this guy. \n\nESH", "Nta your wasting your prime years on his barren testicles", "I was thinking n t a until you tricked him with the condom. It then became ESH. Honestly, take this as a chance to get out before you have kids. He\u2019s shown his true colors to you in this instance, and I really feel you\u2019re better off without him.", "Nta and that man seems overall like a bad person to have children with. If at a time like this he refuses to take any blame and just tries to boss you around instead of acting like an adult, I fear for your future.", "For 3 years your've been tested over and over. He and his family have been bullying you and emotionally/verbally abusing you. He refuses to even CHECK to see if something is wrong with him. Even if he checked now, do you really want to have kids with him? Where female bodies get examined and blamed, but it isn't manly to need a doctor. \n\nMove on. He would be a terrible parent anyway. NTA", "ESH and you\u2019re probably lucky not to be tied to him and his family by children. Find someone decent. (You still can\u2019t manipulate people into a vulnerable position and steal their body fluids though. That\u2019s really violating and gross. I get you were desperate, but no.)", "Oh that man had a vasectomy and didn\u2019t tell her and is using this to control. NTA.", "ESH. What if your husband did a secret pregnancy test on you, or snuck period blood off your discarded pads and tested you for medical conditions? You two deserve each other with your AH behaviors.", "Leave.  Run.", "NTA for the question, but it seems like you are the AH for the lie about the UTI and getting and testing his output.\n\nIf he was talking to his mom and she was saying crazy stuff and he didn't shut it down, it makes me really wonder about him. Him refusing to get tested makes me think he is  stupid. Him doing all that control stuff with the food makes me think he is a real jerk.\n\nAre you sure you want to have children with someone like this?", "Both assholes", "This is what leads me to YTA - because the husband is obviously an awful person, but OP is still actively trying to bring a child into the world to be emotionally abused by this man which is SO morally abhorrent to me. Like, your desire to have a kid isn\u2019t more important than a kid\u2019s right to have kind, secure parents. OP is actively trying to bring a child into an abusive household. Gross.", "OMG this - this is a blessing in disguise. Get out now! \n\nRefusing to take medical tests, refusing to communicate about serious issues, LYING TO HIS MOTHER ABOUT IT AND CALLING YOU BARREN?\n\nWtf are you even trying to hold on to here??\n\nGET OUT\n\nNTA", "With that thinking they'll probably also blame OP if the baby comes out the wrong gender.", "He\u2019s not gaslighting, he\u2019s in denial.", "Yeap. This one. Exactly.", "I\u2019m wondering if this is an out for him- he doesn\u2019t really want kids.", "Imagine having such fragile masculinity that you can't even get tested to address the issue for a kid you supposedly want. \n\nOP, consider this a gift. He won't get tested, and this kind of person can easily blame you for any issues your kids may have in the future. Either don't have kids and stay, or leave and have kids with someone else.", "That's a focal point: this relationship doesn't look like can last. Not the best environment to have children.", "This 100%. She would be better off leaving and using a sperm donor to conceive rather than staying with this guy. He's awful and does not seem like good father material.", "I'm wondering, if he really wants children or if its just his mother pushing him to use his \"prime fertility years\" and this way he can blame her\n\nEither way,  major marinara flags from his side\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "I wrote I wasn\u2019t looking for a diagnoses but wanted to show him he might have low sperm count so he should go to the doctors. Maybe you should read", "More than that, she just shouldn't be vulnerable around this man, and pregnancy is so incredibly vulnerable.", "My wife and I went through 2 years of fertility treatments before we did IVF to have our first son (the second was a \u201csurprise you\u2019re 18 weeks and having a boy\u201d). In the very beginning of it all, we BOTH were tested, and I never blinked at the idea that it could be me. I did whatever was asked of me to do what was needed.", "ESH, but people who REALLY want kids can get a little crazy. They\u2019re stressed, anxious, etc. \n\nI\u2019m not excusing either of them, but they\u2019re not unique.", "how would he screw up his sperm, especially since he didn\u2019t know it was going to happen?", "Shouldn't you come to ESH then? YTA means *only* OP is the AH, which IMO wrongly lets her husband off the hook.", "Honestly, why does OP want a child with this man? I'd take the MIL advice and leave...she's wasting her fertile years on a barren guy\n\nBut shouldn't have done what she did...this won't work well in the future I can see it", "Or an easy out of the marriage.", "I was wondering the same. Maybe its just his mommy that pushes him to use his \"prime fertility years\" - and this way he can blame his wife", "\u2026 maybe you should get a new husband", "That\u2019s a diagnosis, of low sperm count. Maybe you should realise how whack these actions come across.", "That\u2019s\u2026literally what a diagnosis is. Low sperm count. You did a test and the results show that your husband has low sperm count, like, that\u2019s the diagnosis. Don\u2019t be stroppy to people when you\u2019re the one asking for their opinions.", "Could be taking some medicine to screw with it so she wouldn't get pregnant", "And maybe you should realize how whack it is to make your wife do fertility tests for years but refuse to do any yourself.", "It is whack. Why would you want to subject your offspring to him? He seems to have deep insecurities about his manliness that could be toxic to a family", "He wasnt a responsable adult and you step down to his behavior ....i honestly hope you guys dont have kids ....for the sake of them . Both of you aint got the mentality to be behave like adults . \n\nShould have left if he refused ,when you knew its not you .", "I see the problem now", "He does realize it\u2019s whack to make your wife do fertility tests, that\u2019s why he said ESH. He just *also* thinks it\u2019s whack to medically test people without their knowledge.", "Okay, you\u2019re going to defend yourself. But it\u2019s still insane to do a fertility test on him without his consent.", "Everyone agrees his behavior is whack too. Why do you want to have a child with this whack man??", "But it is okay for him to force her for years!!", "She did it with her consent. He didn\u2019t consent.", "Two wrongs don't make a right. The rest of us learned that in kindergarten. Were you sick that day?", "Forcing someone isn\u2019t consent.", "I\u2019m glad you realise what OP did is wrong."]}
