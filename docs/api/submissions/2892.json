I've already been able to plan and execute a lot that has both made the experience fun for my friend and also a lot less stressful.\n\nOnto the issue: My sister's MOH honestly dropped the ball. (I know I'm going to be biased, but I've received complaints from family members and other friends). She hasn't put any effort into helping my sister with her wedding, didn't plan anything, never responds to my sisters messages, and just generally isn't interested at all. None of my sister's other bridesmaids are stepping up either (they all have a reason for why they can't spend more time on my sis's wedding).\n\nMy sister recently approached me to plan *everything* for her: bridal shower, bachelorette, and the actual wedding. She wants me to give her the same experience I've given my friend. I was a little offended because she only asked me after she saw what a great job I did for someone else. But she's my sister, so I told her I'd be willing to help if she made me a bridesmaid. I feel like it's the least she could do and it would make me feel less like an errand girl and really part of the wedding. \n\nShe refused and said that I'd make the numbers off and that I didn't have \"the look\" she was trying to accomplish, which REALLY offended me. Like at this point I'm just pissed. \n\nSo I said fine, I don't have to be part of the wedding, but then she needs to hire me as a wedding planner because I'm not doing this for free. It takes a huge time commitment to do all of this work!\n\nShe went crying to mom and dad now, and they'll all calling me an AH because I should do it as a sister.

Your sister is obnoxious, cruel, and entitled, and given the reaction from your parents, it's clear where she gets it from.  Her \"special day\" is her responsibility, not yours.  I think it would be a real mistake to take part in it even if she pays you though.  Just bow out of the planning process entirely - make it clear that you are delighted to attend her wedding, but that the planning and execution of the wedding aren't your responsibility and that you do not have the ability to take it on.", "Firm NTA, your sister only wants your assistance now that her preferred option has fallen through, and she seems to think you should be falling over yourself with gratitude to accept the responsibilities of a MOH without actually\u2026 receiving the honorary title that goes with those responsibilities. That in itself is *delusional* and her part, and actively dehumanizing to you. Screw that noise. \n\nYou certainly aren\u2019t running her special day, her childish petulance is doing that just fine on it\u2019s own. I dare say her behaviour likely drove away her last MOH, so why should you be subjected to the same just because you\u2019re fAmiLy? \n\nNot to add insult to injury, but your sister doesn\u2019t appear to deem you worthy of standing beside her as kin on her special day for superficial reasons - you don\u2019t have *the look*, whatever the hell that means - but you sure are good enough to be a servant, scuttling around with the other undesirables making her dream day come true. As long as you remain in the shadows though, the bride wouldn\u2019t want anyone to confuse the servant, slaving away fulfilling the MOH duties as part of the wedding party, *guffaws* why that would just be absurd!\n\nI don\u2019t know what kind of person your sister is, but the words entitled, greatly lacking in empathy and self awareness, and main character syndrome spring to mind pretty easily.
