I think it would be a real mistake to take part in it even if she pays you though.  Just bow out of the planning process entirely - make it clear that you are delighted to attend her wedding, but that the planning and execution of the wedding aren't your responsibility and that you do not have the ability to take it on.", "Firm NTA, your sister only wants your assistance now that her preferred option has fallen through, and she seems to think you should be falling over yourself with gratitude to accept the responsibilities of a MOH without actually\u2026 receiving the honorary title that goes with those responsibilities.

Screw that noise. \n\nYou certainly aren\u2019t running her special day, her childish petulance is doing that just fine on it\u2019s own. I dare say her behaviour likely drove away her last MOH, so why should you be subjected to the same just because you\u2019re fAmiLy? \n\nNot to add insult to injury, but your sister doesn\u2019t appear to deem you worthy of standing beside her as kin on her special day for superficial reasons - you don\u2019t have *the look*, whatever the hell that means - but you sure are good enough to be a servant, scuttling around with the other undesirables making her dream day come true. As long as you remain in the shadows though, the bride wouldn\u2019t want anyone to confuse the servant, slaving away fulfilling the MOH duties as part of the wedding party, *guffaws* why that would just be absurd!\n\nI don\u2019t know what kind of person your sister is, but the words entitled, greatly lacking in empathy and self awareness, and main character syndrome spring to mind pretty easily.

Your sister is a user!", "Nta. Your sister just wants to take advantage of you.", "NTA. She is asking you to be the unofficial maid of honor/wedding organizer but she doesn't want you to be those things. This is a problem that she created herself.", ">I didn't have \"the look\" she was trying to accomplish\n\nI mean, I thought NTA from the start, but boy does that clinch it. She picked girls for looks, but apparently not for other essential attributes and is now paying the consequences. She can pay you, or she can pay someone else. Or she can do all the work herself.\n\nI would recommend you excuse yourself from her wedding, period, and don't even plan to go as a guest.", "NTA\nYou guys don\u2019t have a bad relationship with each other so there\u2019s really no reason you shouldn\u2019t be part of such a large bridal party. That alone is hurtful but it sounds like you handled that in a really mature manner.\nNow she wants you to do all the work of the MOH but won\u2019t even make you a bridesmaid because you \u201cdon\u2019t have the right look\u201d?! She can fvck off with that BS.", "NTA. you weren't good enough till the person she chose went full shortbus then suddenly she tried to dump the whole shebang on you? ohhhh that's a giant fuck you in any language. you did nothing wrong kiddo. don't let the clueless users blame you for fucking the bridezilla's special day up. she did that all on her lonesome. your sis shit the bed, let the her shovel her own mess. wave kisses and bon voyages at the shitshow as it rolls by but do not let it roll over you.", "Not the AH at all. Don\u2019t listen to them. Stand your ground.", "Absolutely NTA. If mom and dad are so bent out about it then they can plan it for her, since it\u2019s obviously no big deal. \n\n\nHow dare she treat you this way. You deserve better. Being family doesn\u2019t excuse shit treatment. Good on you for standing up for yourself. I would die on this hill. Pay me or miss me with that shit, babe.", "NTA but your sister is, and her MOH.", "You should do it \u201cas a sister\u201d but she shouldn\u2019t include you as one out of ten bridesmaids \u201cas a sister\u201d?   What an asshole.  Tell her you don\u2019t think you \u201chave the look\u201d she wants when it comes to planning.", "Stow your pride for a minute and think about if it will be fun to wedding plan for your sister.  Are you close?  If you aren\u2019t that close then walk away, if you are or you want to be then help her out.  \n\nDon\u2019t get hung up on the title, her friends all suck and there\u2019s probably more going on.  If you are close with your family it\u2019s worth a lot.", "I was trying to find a word and \u201cghoulish\u201d is pretty damn close.", "You forget about self interest. Her parents do not want to do the planning. Pawn it off on someone else", "Yeah, OP, stop trying to angle different ways to feel less hurt over what your sister did. Don't ask for money. Don't ask to be a bridesmaid, just tell her, not in a mean way, but that she should communicate more with her bridal party, because they should be doing these things. Then, move on with your life.", "I don't want [_X person i supposedly love] in my wedding because ... \"they don't have the right look.\" WTAF\n\nSister was being self-centered and just gross even if she hadn't asked OP to do all this work with no recognition. But add that in and I'm just ... flabbergasted. \n\nIf mom and dad think it's so important,  they can step up and do the work for sister. \n\nOP is only the A (to herself) if she actually caves in to this selfish manipulative... person (I'm livid for her but trying not to get banned lol)", "NTA. If OP\u2019s sister and OP\u2019s future spouse aren\u2019t able to plan the wedding themselves they need to hire a professional wedding planner. \n\nThe bride needs to step up and do the research, planning, and communication for those events. She can ask for help on specific tasks e.g. if she wanted her bridal parties input on decisions, but that\u2019s not OPs job. \n\nAlso, your sister is shallow for picking bridesmaids based on looks. That makes it less surprising that out of TEN people no one is really helping plan the bachelorette party.", "I wouldn't even go. F her sister. NTA", "There's 10 in the wedding party fir the bride. Where are they? Bridezilla maybe?", "> I didn't have \"the look\" she was trying to accomplish\n\nIf I was in your shoes, when sis *still* asked for my help after *that*, I would have bounced it back at her; \"nah, you don't have the right look... you don't look like someone I should help.\" \nAnd she sure as hell doesn't *act* like someone who *deserves* your help.\n\n NTA. Stay strong, you lil steel-spined rebel.", "Honestly op shouldn\u2019t even offer pleasantries. Their sister straight up insulted their appearance.", "and disrespectful too.......only pulled out the \"family\" card when she was having to face the consequences of her choices", "And the way the MOH and the bridesmaids are ignoring her, are they even going to show up for the wedding?", "She also broke etiquette protocol by not having her sister in her wedding party.", "Yep... she wanted human shaped props instead of people who were reliable, responsible, enthusiastic, etc. And it sounds like that's exactly what she got.", "No shit it\u2019s her wedding, let her fucking plan it!!!", "I know. I did all the planning for mine. Not anyone else\u2019s responsibility. And 10 bridesmaids? Who does that unless you\u2019re a multi millionaire and can afford a wedding planner.\n\nNTA", "Because she's the *princess* and *golden child* and shouldn't have to lift a finger........", "Yes! FAFO. NTA.", "Or she doesn\u2019t surround herself with quality friends. Only \u201cfriends\u201d that have \u201cthe look\u201d. Regardless- OP is NTA. Your sister needs to get over herself & get her priorities right.  The wedding is supposed to be a celebration of love and commitment to your life partner. Not just a photo op.", ".........the chutzpah", "Bingo.", "Roping in anyone else to lay all the responsibility on  for failure (bc success will be all the bride's right?) is so much easier.", "Oh! I thought those kinds of transactions happen when you pay somebody for the labor? wink. wink.", "Seriously!! The line was already crossed, frankly, I\u2019m my opinion, by not being able to find one spot out of 10 for your own freaking sister in your wedding party. The look comment push it over another line.", "But that would take away from Princess Golden Child's wedding fund.......plus OP is *faaaaaaaaaaaaaaamily* and should do whatever PGC wants bc she's the bride \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Of course you understand as a member of the feline elite yourself."]}
