Your sister is obnoxious, cruel, and entitled, and given the reaction from your parents, it's clear where she gets it from.  Her \"special day\" is her responsibility, not yours.  I think it would be a real mistake to take part in it even if she pays you though.  Just bow out of the planning process entirely - make it clear that you are delighted to attend her wedding, but that the planning and execution of the wedding aren't your responsibility and that you do not have the ability to take it on.", "Firm NTA, your sister only wants your assistance now that her preferred option has fallen through, and she seems to think you should be falling over yourself with gratitude to accept the responsibilities of a MOH without actually\u2026 receiving the honorary title that goes with those responsibilities.

Screw that noise. \n\nYou certainly aren\u2019t running her special day, her childish petulance is doing that just fine on it\u2019s own. I dare say her behaviour likely drove away her last MOH, so why should you be subjected to the same just because you\u2019re fAmiLy? \n\nNot to add insult to injury, but your sister doesn\u2019t appear to deem you worthy of standing beside her as kin on her special day for superficial reasons - you don\u2019t have *the look*, whatever the hell that means - but you sure are good enough to be a servant, scuttling around with the other undesirables making her dream day come true. As long as you remain in the shadows though, the bride wouldn\u2019t want anyone to confuse the servant, slaving away fulfilling the MOH duties as part of the wedding party, *guffaws* why that would just be absurd!\n\nI don\u2019t know what kind of person your sister is, but the words entitled, greatly lacking in empathy and self awareness, and main character syndrome spring to mind pretty easily.

Really try talking to her and letting her know how hurt it made you feel to not be chosen at all in the first place. There's gotta be a mid step between forcing her to boot someone who may be less understanding than family would be assumed. Also a friend may just cut contact but family is forever. Just please understand that where I think you did wrong... And the only part where I feel you were not 100 in the right, is by telling her you won't unless she makes you a bridesmaid.
