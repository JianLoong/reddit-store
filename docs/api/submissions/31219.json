{"id": 31219, "submission_id": "17y9g8t", "title": "AITA for leaving the family reunion over a joke?", "selftext": "I, fem 23, have a boyfriend named Paul. We met 4 years ago and have been dating for about 3 years. Our relationship has been normal until at the family reunion things took a turn. Me and Paul decided to attend this event with my family, and in-laws, including my brother in law. I never had a problem with him we weren't ever that close. The day of the family reunion was a hot day. I knew most of the women there would probably wear the usual tshirt and shorts. I wore long pants. Some people looked at me weirdly but no one said anything. At some point, everyone sat down to eat. I sat next to Paul. While everyone was talking and having a good time my sister in law, let's call her Alyssa, just pointed out why I wasn't wearing shorts like everyone else. I said I got cold easily and tried to change the subject. Since she brang it up now everyone was talking about it exept my bestfriend (she is close to our family so she was also there). I was in a fire awhile ago and got some scars on my legs from the incident. She knew I didn't like showing them. Me and my bestfriend just tried to change the topic but everyone kept pushing saying, \"we need to buy that girl some shorts,\" and stuff like that. I got up to use the restroom to cool down. I hated talking about my legs as I'm quite insecure. When I got back my brother inlaw said, \"its because of the brun scars right?\" infornt of everyone. I was shook and turned pale. \"Look, its okay honestly nobody gives a shit about it\" he continued. \"I mean maybe everyone expect Paul, he's athletic and good looking so he can basically get any girl he wants.\" I was on the verge of tears. Everyone was laughing exept me, my bestfriend, and Paul. After Paul had a moment to take everything in, he got up and came to me. He said, \"we're leaving.\" Paul took my hand and we left to go to his car together. While we were walking i silently cried and looked at Paul. He was so red. Once we sat down and I calmed down a bit we talked about the whole thing. He said he loved me no matter what and scars don't change that. He also added that the fact that I experienced such difficult things and I still stay strong makes him love me even more. I was so happy and told him I loved him aswell. Paul then said that my brother in law was a bitch and if he sees him again he couldn't guarantee he would be able to hold back his anger. Paul is a 6'3 boxer so its safe to assume it would be over for him. We laughed for a bit about it and then he hugged me and drove me home. Currently I'm at home writing this after everything. My best friend texted me to see how I was and told me that after I left things got awkward and people thought I \"took it too seriously.\" I think I reacted appropriately given the situation and my boyfriend agrees.", "created_utc": 1700323055, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17y9g8t/aita_for_leaving_the_family_reunion_over_a_joke/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think Paul is fabulous for sticking up for you and getting you to leave. I come from a shitty family to and it sucks i find in your early 20s when you start to realize that behaviour like that is uncalled for and inappropriate. \nYou  know what, nobody would care if you wore shorts but if you don\u2019t want to then fucking don\u2019t. Rock those pants.", "NTA.  Your BIL sounds like an asshat.  No one gets to tell you how to feel, ESPECIALLY about your own trauma.  They are trying to minimize it because it makes them all less culpable in their minds.  Your boyfriend sounds super supportive and so does your friend.  I hope you can see that that is what love and care should look like, not what happened with your biological family and in-laws.", "What the shit? NTA at ALL. Your BIL is a huge AH and so were all the people who kept prying in the first place and those who laughed. Jesus, the coldness, I'm surprised you didn't freeze on your way out, but it sounds like Paul took amazing care of you and kept you warm. He sounds like a keeper \ud83d\udc9b", "NTA - Sounds like you just found out who your true family is. Your friend and Paul. Family is the people who love and respect you. Just because the rest are related by blood or marriage does not make them family. I would go no contact with everyone who laughed along with BIL. \n\nDrop the people who bring you down. No one has time for that Bs. Life is to short to put up with that.", "Things like this, horrible as they are, are useful to know who to cut out your life and who is good in your life.\n\nNTA, Paul sounds like a nice chap. Personally I would have had a more verbally abusive response rather than just leave. So no you didn't go too far", "NTA absolutely. What your BIL said was completely disrespectful and rude and you had every right to leave. I\u2019m getting a feeling that he\u2019s never felt insecurity being surrounded by your boyfriend\u2019s family and how they act.", "Nta, and after your bf boxes the crap out of bil face, ask him if he wants a mask to hide the broken nose.\n\nYour family sounds way too tiresome", "NTA. Even if BIL said it's okay and that nobody cares about your scars. They should've dropped the subject and moved on to a different topic. Talking about your insecurities to the whole family was disrespectful. On the positive side, your bf seems like a keeper.", "NTA\n\nPaul is a damn keeper standing up for you like that and you are an absolute warrior.  How dare your family minimize your feelings about your scars and the trauma associated with how they came to be in your body.  That\u2019s your own journey and you don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation.  Glad you have your bestie and bf in your corner.", "NTA", "NTA. BiL, total AH. Paul, complete gem.", "NTA. Your BIL is a bully, and he's the one that made things awkward. People saying you shouldn't \"take it too seriously\" are just enabling him. Your boyfriend sounds wonderful.", ">I think I reacted appropriately given the situation and my boyfriend agrees.\n\nNTA. While most people are probably more assertive and confrontational than you are, had either you or your boyfriend acted differently after your \"let me step away and cool down\" routine did not work, you would have each risked giving the appearance of condoning disrespect to the other's relationship, and you would have risked being disrespectful to your family. Sometimes avoidance is the correct action.", " NTA - sorry OP, the family is a huge bunch of AHs. I would have walked out after dumping something on top of that Jackass", "NTA. Paul is an absolute gem for his support. Your family are awful people and they should ask for forgiveness for not standing up to your BIL.", "NTA\n\nNever joke about other peoples past accidents/bad experiences UNLESS said person jokes about them FIRST", "NTA. Congrats on having a good partner. It also insults Paul by implying that he is shallow (into looks only) and would not be faithful. There would be lots of yelling already if it\u2019s my case lol", "NTA, that was a horrible thing for your Bil to do. Idk how long ago you were burned, but I was really badly burned around 12 years ago and I can tell you, it gets easier. At first I hated the thought of leaving the house and was embarrassed wearing my compression garments. Luckily I had people who supported me and made me feel comfortable. Now I barely notice them. But even so, you never have to justify wanting to cover them up.", "NTA. Publicly humiliating people for issues like this is beyond rude.", "OP, you are NTA. Regardless of how serious or trivial the situation may seem, you were affected enough by it that your family shouldn\u2019t have made jokes at your expense. To experience a life changing event like surviving burns is not a punchline for others to laugh at. Burns come with trauma and, as you point out, can change a person\u2019s view of themselves. I don\u2019t even like using the word \u201cvictim\u201d for these events because even language can impact how a person survives these events. Your boyfriend was incredibly sweet and displayed a real sense of love and support during the whole ordeal. I would have thrown hands on the spot, so he\u2019s also displaying patience and emotional maturity in his restraint. I\u2019m so sorry you had to deal with that, and it should in no way make you feel guilty. People are cruel, that\u2019s a hard truth. But people can also be capable of acts of undeniable love - that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting from Paul.", "It's so weird that everyone made a big deal over a woman \"not showing enough skin\". Every time I'm at the beach there's always one man in a T-shirt and long shorts. And no one ever gives them grief for not taking off more layers. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour BIL sucks, as does everyone else there other than your BFF and your bf. Nobody should be making you feel bad about your own trauma. Those people might be your family on paper, but they're just crummy people who don't deserve your time.", "NTA.  Your bf rocks that titanium spine.Refusing to be bullied is absolutely the right answer.  If things got awkward, that\u2019s on your BiL and his clingons.   Hope they read this thread and all the judgement they\u2019re going to get for being AH\u2019s.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The turkeys would have thrived on your distress had you stayed, or called the police if your boyfriend responded physically.
