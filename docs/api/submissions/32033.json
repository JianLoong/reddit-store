A common contract item is minimum number of songs to be played by the band in order for them to be paid in full.  This is why a lot of times a band will have a member that is sick but they still manage to play 5 songs.

She performed poorly, for a much shorter time period than agreed upon. If OP is expected to pay for transport, food, etc., it is up to the vendor to maintain the receipts. I don't know about you, but I get my work to subsidize my transport. They won't give me reimburse me without proper documentation. Also, providing adequate notice for payment is reasonable. If there was nothing documented about late fees, she is not entitled to any money. She cannot make up random fine print on a contract that doesn't exist. It would NEVER hold up in court.
