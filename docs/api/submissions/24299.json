However, I talked to my dad about it and he said \u201cwait, your paying for your own school supplies?\u201d I said yes and apparently my mom was supposed to be paying for my school supplies with the child support money he sends her, apparently I should not be paying for my own. So I talked to my mom about it and she blew up on me, saying I was a smart ass and ungrateful and I should forget about buying any school supplies for the principle of me being insensitive, I do feel a bit bad because all of this would\u2019ve been avoided if I had just bought my own.

Do not listen to mum okay? You are a minor and both parents are responsible for financially supporting you. What is child support money for? To buy you your school supplies, pay your medical and dental bills and pay for your enrichment classes during after school hours", "NTA. You are a minor and parents are responsible for covering those supplies, not you. Your mom got \"caught\" by your casually mentioning this to your dad. That's her problem for essentially stealing from your funds for other bills. There is nothing insensitive about what you did. \n\nMake sure one of your parents pays for those school supplies, not you. Your mother lashed out inappropriately. You are not being ungrateful, she's being dishonest.", "NTA- this sounds like a conflict between your parents about who covers the school supplies and it was not okay for her to react the way she did just because you told her what your father told you.", "NTA. Also, you can be 16 and have a bank account, you don\u2019t have to be 18", "NTA\n\nSounds like something your father needs to bring up with the courts tbh. If your mom isnt using the money for your support he might need to get a legal remedy because contrary to what people seem to believe, child support is meant to be used for the child's benefit.", "NTA - Maybe your dad can give you a prepaid debit card to use for things like this, that way you don't have to ask permission or pay your mom back for things you need.", "NTA: youre just conveying the message that your dad told you to your mom. my guess is that she is not having this rection to you wanting her to pay for school supplies, but rather the fact that your dad is questioning her parenting/how she is treating her financials", "NTA but your dad gave you a very simplistic view of child support and you ran with it. Child support pays for half of the needs of a minor child and it usually doesn't even cover that. So at best child support would cover half (maybe) of your school supplies. That is assuming it is enough to cover half of your cost to just live (mortgage, food, utilities, activities, clothing, etc). \n\nAgain, NTA but don't just take what your dad says at face value. Approach things more carefully.", "No if yr still in school yr a child and regardless of yr parents have split it's them that should be buying them for u.", "NTA. You're stuck in the middle and shouldn't be. Your dad needs to talk to your mom if he disagrees with something she does in parenting you. Also, he pays child support but he does not decide where the money should be spent or what it is needed for- only your mother does.", "You are not the asshole in this situation.\n\nI will say, if this was just you trying to play your parents off of each other to gain in a material way, then you would be the asshole.\n\nYour mom's point of view really is around trying to teach you responsibility and how to handle your own finances.  Having a job and taking on this responsibility is important for a person your age.  And then you build on that so that when you are off on your own, your parents can trust that you can take care of yourself and you can be an expert at being responsible for yourself.  It is called Self Reliance.\n\nIn THIS situation however, your father is correct. he pays your mother money, which is a requirement of the court system, so that your mother can support you and make sure you have everything you need to grow up into a responsible adult.\n\nThis one is almost a nobody is the asshole, but by law that money should be going towards your good welfare and that does mean school supplies.\n\nPutting myself in your shoes, and your mom's, and your dad's - your dad is correct.  If this was a race it would be a photo finish because throughout all of this, remember:\n\nYour parents are upset because the main goal here is YOUR WELFARE. That means they are mad because they both love you very much.  You are not the asshole here. I think they just need to get on the same page about where you are in life and what you need to be successful.\n\nThey both have good points, but your dad's is slightly more prominent because he is required to send that money to your mother, or face some serious consequences. And since they both don't have tons of cash, these situations can be precarious and include high levels of emotion.", "NTA. Maybe your dad can split child support and give you the amount, that is for things that go directly to you eg. Clothes, school supplies etc. And give your mom the part for stuff like groceries, rent, electricity, transportation etc.", "How much does he pay a month in child support and is he current? Full info needed given the cost of living\u2026.", "NTA your mom is Just shitty.  You are a minor and are not responsible for paying for anything Necessaries.  She is just mad that she got caught be shady. What kind of parent tells a child to \u201cforget\u201d about school supplies and calling that child insensitive and ungrateful.  She should be ashamed of herself.  Ask your dad to buy your school supplies.", "NTA\n\nMy daughter is 16 and has a debit card. Different banks have different rules. When you're an adult, you can have an account all on your own. I advise you to choose a bank your mother doesn't use. \n\nYour mom is showing you who she is. She's a thief. Don't trust her with money. Don't lend her money. Check your credit report. You need to wise up and grow up quickly, so you're not reliant on your mom. She's not on your team.", "ESH\n\nYou should not pay for your own school supplies, however; it sounds like your mother said she would pay if you went to Walmart, which you declined.", "NTA -- can you move in with your dad, all you are is a cash machine for her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS, many teachers are paid fairly.", "Ruh roh! Busted!!\n\nMom's TA!", "Eh, Once my kids got jobs there were certain thing I made them pay for even when they were under 18 and I was receiving child support. Obvs I do not expect them to pay rent, utilities, food etc but if they wanted an extra expensive pair of shoes or clothing items there were times I made them buy the items themselves. I taught them fiscal responsibility. I never went the school supply route, in high school they don\u2019t need a ton anyway so it wasn\u2019t that expensive anyway- as long as we didn\u2019t have to buy expensive calculators every year- which I would have bought. My kids wanted to build expensive computers-  they paid for them. I can go either way on this", "NTA. Tell her that since she has a problem spending the child support on her actual child that you will ask your dad to buy the things you need, and he can deduct the cost out of what she gets a month from him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just a heads up, but if you're over 13, you can absolutely have a debit card if one of your parents will help you open an account", "Nta it is your parents job to provide all your necessities.", "You have no idea how much he is paying. How can you make a judgement on what is affordable. Regardless, a minor should not be expected to cover school costs.", "OP is a minor it is not their responsibility to pay for supplies vital to their education. Their father pays child support it's the mothers responsibility to meet the remaining cost of necessities not the child", "You have no idea how much child support OP\u2019s dad pays.  You also do not know how much time OP spends with each parent which affects his payment amt.  Even if his child support only covered half her expenses OP\u2019s mom  would be responsible for the other half.  By your logic OP should be paying for her food and personal hygiene essentials.\n\nWhat the child support payments cover is not OP\u2019s business.

If he had specifically paid mom extra to get her some, then this isn't simplistic- he may have legit given money directly forschool supplies", "Unless it is specifically included in the divorce decree. Family court judges really don't like it when you try to make your minor child pay for things that child support should cover.", "Unfortunately mom can use this as a way to take him back to court.", "A small percentage of teachers in the US are paid fairly.", "True. I can't imagine a divorce decree specifying that child support pays for school supplies, though I have seen one saying parents split textbooks."]}
