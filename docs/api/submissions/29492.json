Their dad left when oldest was 5 because we aren\u2019t worth the stress. I was terrified because we were about to be homeless but I managed to find a job.  \n\nI hadn\u2019t seen my family since they cut me off for getting pregnant as a teenager but my older brother found me and made me move in with him and his family. We live in their basement rent free and it\u2019s more than enough. \n\nI feel a little awkward around his wife and kids (he has two preteen daughters) but they\u2019re always nice to me and my kids when we see each other. \n\nWell it was my brother\u2019s birthday yesterday and we were all upstairs having dinner. My brother left the house to get something so he wasn\u2019t home for a bit. My son accidentally spilled juice on himself so I took him to get cleaned. He then got all worked up and tired so I quickly put him to bed. My daughters came down as well and I sat with them for a bit till they slept. After all that, I was going back upstairs and heard SIL+nieces talking about me.\n\n\u201cDid she really get pregnant at 15?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and look how she ended up. She\u2019s lucky your dad is so kind because you know she was pretty much homeless before we took her in\u2026 you guys better not get pregnant, I don\u2019t want you to end up like her.\u201d \n\nI mean, my situation is pretty pathetic and it\u2019s true I\u2019m lucky my brother found me. So I was just gonna ignore her. But then she started telling the girls my entire life story. Again, ok but she was telling them some embarrassing details and making me out to be a horrible human being. She told them I did drugs while pregnant (not true), she told them I probably have mental illness X and X (I don\u2019t), and she told them that I was probably going to abandon my kids or give them up if my brother hadn\u2019t found me. Her kids both went \u201cOh yeah I can see her doing that, she doesn\u2019t seem entirely there\u201d\n\nIt hurt really bad to hear how badly they thought of me and I regret telling my brother and SIL what happened to me. I know I\u2019m not a role model and probably should be ashamed of myself, but I didn\u2019t think they thought so lowly of me. \n\nI just went to bed and thought about ignoring it but now I\u2019m wondering if I should tell my brother. It\u2019s childish and petty of me, right? I feel like it\u2019d be pretty to go crying to my brother about his wife and kids. I just don\u2019t know if I can look any of them in the eye anymore but I don\u2019t want to risk being kicked out. WIBTA if I told my brother what they said and potentially start a fight or argument or at least stress them out? I already know I\u2019m being too much literally living with them so I don\u2019t know.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI\u2019ve been saving to move out and get my own place for me and my kids since we moved in. It\u2019s not a secret either. I just got my certifications to get a better paying job so it shouldn\u2019t take too long now.

It sucks, but you\u2019re in a precarious situation right now. Good for you for being able to save and get a place! There is light at the end of the tunnel.", "NTA Though, I think you should confront SIL for the lies she told.  Call her out on it and tell her if she is going to talk about you, to use the truth and if your nieces have any questions, you will be glad to answer them.  If you decided to just bring it up to your brother, I would do it the night before you move because it most likely will cause trouble from SIL who a very judgmental jerk is!", "Best thing I would do is don't say anything start saving whatever you can and get out of there asap", "YWNBTA, sounds to me your brother truly loves and wants to see you succeed so you need to tell him what SIL said. What parts of her story are false and how it hurts you when you didn't ask to live with them, you were basically forced. If you were my sister and I heard my spouse saying something like that, I'd want to know ASAP to nip it in the bud.", "To need to be logical. You can\u2019t control what people say or think. If you tell your brother you are only going to create a more hostile environment for your kids. Keep working and saving your money. Think of your kids and not your pride.", "You ARE a role model - you stepped up to care for your children despite being young yourself, got yourself and job and by all accounts sound like a good mother.  You\u2019ve been working towards a better life.\n\nSo you did some stuff when you were a teenager. You are not defined by that.", "NTA.\n\nBut I\u2019d suggest speaking to your brother and SIL together, and not in an accusatory way. You have every right to explain that you\u2019re hurt by the embellishments and you\u2019re happy to share with their children where you feel you\u2019ve made mistakes but not at the expense of your dignity. Help doesn\u2019t come with strings. They freely offered it and that does not give them the right to treat you poorly.\n\nBut - you really do need to give yourself some grace here. There is a big difference between owning your own actions, and beating yourself up for them.\n\nYou\u2019re doing all the right things now. You didn\u2019t make good choices from 15-20 because you were a child. A child manipulated and taken advantage of by a much older man. In as much as you\u2019ve taken responsibility for your own life, you must also acknowledge that you were a victim. And your strength in rising above, in accepting help, is to be admired and not denigrated. Not by you and not by anyone.\n\nHave that conversation with them.", "Wait until you can leave then drop the bomb on her on the way our. This is ALL on your SIL. what an awful person. NTA", "YWNBTA But it might jeopardise your living situation so I wouldn't say a damn WORD until you have your own place and are settled. \n\nI know it's humiliating to be lied about, shamed and pitied. I was a teenage mum myself. But you'll get through this. The best revenge will be living well.", "All the advice on here about confronting her or your brother are absolutely terrible. Some people on reddit just love to see the world burn, except in this case it would be yours. Don't do it. You've learned a valuable piece of information that will be useful to you later, just not now. Stay grateful and focused on your plan to move out ASAP. What they think of you will come in handy later: in deciding how much you want to keep them in your life after you've become independent. Remember that while you're clearly not perfect, you are doing your best for you and your kids. That's all that matters. Once the emotion subsided and you are out of there, you'll know what to do. All the best!", "Sounds like what they were saying was what they sincerely thought, not things they were saying to be mean. You should probably look in the mirror.", "NTA. You know them best, so it\u2019s your decision to address it either before or after you move out. I do think your SIL is doing a disservice to her girls, because she makes it sound like only mentally ill or addicted young women are vulnerable to these situations, and that\u2019s so untrue! Young women need to understand that grooming and abuse can happen to anyone, and falling victim to shitty men doesn\u2019t make you stupid or weak. I think you\u2019re incredibly strong for going through all this and still being a loving and capable mother to your kids. You got this. \u2764\ufe0f", "Yes but say this to her while the brother is present.", "I'd say it in front of all of them, including brother!", "This is the best answer!", "I'd sit down with them both. That way bro knows what was said, and SIL's reaction will show bro who she is.", "While I don\u2019t think the SIL should have said all she did, I highly doubt she would be looking for OP to look after her kids much less guide them.", "I was curious about that as well.  It sounds like she may have been living with her brother for maybe 4 years since her partner/husband lefts when the oldest was 5 (now 9).  \n\nHonestly, instead of worrying about your SIL is saying or doing, OP needs to figure out how to afford your own place.  What's the point of confronting SIL and/or brother only for OP to continue living in their home for another 5 years.  If anything, it might make the negative comments and impressions by SIL seem more true.", "Woah I didn\u2019t even catch that she\u2019s been living there for 4 years. I feel for OP but her living there rent-free with her kids for 4 years certainly doesn\u2019t leave a good impression on SIL. SIL likely wants OP and her kids out of her house after all that time. OP needs to move out ASAP.", "And even a cautionary tale would be better delivered by OP herself.", "We don't know that the SIL is lying. She may believe its true. Maybe OPs brother told her that or maybe OP was doing drugs before and everyones just assuming.", "Exactly. I though I wouldn't assume the brother passed on these thoughts, as SIL could have very easily just fabricated these extra details to further try and keep her children from teen pregnancy. A quick perusal of the testimonials in this thread shows she's far from the only one. My own family embellished the experiences of family memebers to keep me from drugs, so it's hardly unprecedented.", "Plus no talk about OP's husband who up and left family because it was too hard? Like, this is ALL on OP and he had no part of it? Many people who become single parents struggle at first regardless of age...", "Wait, \"neglecting your children on purpose\", what? So there was neglect going on? Somethings fishy about a number of your comments, but overall you're within your rights to tell him and be NTA. It's a teachable moment for their kids to understand it's not right to judge people on something they know nothing about. Everyone's challenges in life are different, and everyone makes their own choices too. Its about how you handle it that's important. So good luck with that.", "I don\u2019t think she should be going to either of them while she is still in their house. Her children\u2019s stability and well-being come before hurt feelings and an incorrect story.", "Be smart, keep your mouth closed, talking solves nothing, you wont change her mind and it will only hurt you. Keep saving to move out, work hard on your career, land your first job then work hard on getting promotions and in five- ten years time when you've got your own place, certifications, a career with a couple promotions under your belt say to SIL \"not bad for a drug addicted, mentally ill teen mom, where's your career btw SIL?\"", "I'm assuming 4 years if her ex left when the eldest child was 5 and the eldest is now 9.\n\nOP rubbed me the wrong way when she said her brother \"made\" her move in, yet also admits that she doesn't have the money to move out. I think he offered and she accepted. \n\nThere's just a lack of responsibility there for herself and her children. She didn't have one accidental pregnancy she was a teen mum 3 times and has been relying on this woman's charity for many years. I love all my sisters dearly and get along well with hubby's family yet I couldn't have any of them in my house for such a prolonged period. The fact this woman did so that OP could get qualifications to get a better job is extremely kind. Also based on the conversation OP overheard this was clearly not something her SiL regularly vents about to her daughters. OP needs to be more responsible for herself and her family. It's fine to correct the record on the parts that are incorrect but it should be done respectfully and with acknowledgement for all the assistance and sacrifices OPs brother and his wife have made.", "This is a good framing. I would advise her to go with this framing or not tell at all. People love getting sweet sweet justice vicariously on this sub, but sometimes in life it's time to be strategic instead of going for what would satisfy you right away, even if it's justice and you're owed it. I worry about the unpredictable effects if she confronts anyone here. I think she would really, really regret it if some resulting family blow-up ended up getting her and her kids kicked out--and depending on what these people are like deep down, it could.", "While yes I would want to tell him I would wait. Save up, and wait. It could backfire and he could side with his wife. I would hope not but you truly never know. Sometimes when you know your friend has been cheated on you tell them. And sometimes they get mad at you. It makes no sense but crazy shit happens. I commend OP for keeping her family together and busting her ass to do what\u2019s right for her kids. Also she should seek out child support.", "Maybe not. But is that a risk op can take? Cost-benefit analysis my friends. While the benefit of informing the brother or confronting the SIL is tempting, I do not believe it is worth the potential cost of being kicked out. Better to stick out the silent animosity for the time being.", "The \u201con purpose\u201d was referring to my brother making things up. As in he wouldn\u2019t make things up on purpose. I wasn\u2019t really thinking about my grammar or punctuation but I can see how it could be misinterpreted.", "Exactly, like when there is some kind of conversation about drugs just throw a \"I'm proud that I never did drugs\" or the other one \"glad I never had any mental illness\".", "Agreed, when it's time to hand the keys back, do it in front of ALL of them and say what u/Dittoheadforever said to say, then turn around and leave. It will give OP a chance to see everyone's reactions including the brothers which should tell her if she can truly trust her brother or not.", "They do drug tests during pregnancy and when you give birth. There isnt going to be an investigation because some teenage girl said something.", "Sweetheart please please stop beating yourself up. You've let all the shitty comments from your parents, ex and now sil get into your head and totally mess your confidence up. You got caught in a bad situation as a minor. That isn't your fault and your family should have protected and supported you instead of sending you off to remain abused by your ex, who sounds like he groomed you, abused you, then got bored of the responsibilities he created. All of these experiences have the power to make or break you. Please don't let them break you. Stop putting yourself down and also trust your instincts more. Sounds like you were right to be nervous of her. You've got nothing to be ashamed of and I'd like to think your brother has your back now he's grown enough to actually understand how vulnerable you were back then. Let him help. Let people love you without feeling like you owe them the world. You are trying to be a good Mama. You should be proud of how far you've come. Don't ever let anyone make you feel less than. You've come so far.", "Did it occur to you that your SIL was told these things by either your brother or your parents? Perhaps your parents had to justify why they kicked out their pregnant 15 year old daughter. \n\nI know people on here love to think people can go off hall-cocked and tell anyone off just bc the target is an AH. But this is the real world with real world consequences. The bottom line is: your brother isn\u2019t the only one providing you with free shelter. Your brother AND his wife are allowing you to live in their home rent free. Should this be a pass to say any damn thing she wants about you? No of course not. But you need to bite your tongue until you are out of their home. Last thing you need is to find yourself with a 30 day eviction notice (if they even have to provide that, depends on where you live) when you aren\u2019t in a position to get a new place. Think of your children first and your hurt feelings later. \nPlease extend grace until you talk to your SIL about this, AFTER you move out.", "I never had drug tests done on me during any of my three pregnancies or labours?", "They test your placenta and if you ever peed in a cup for them you were drug tested.", "If you think that brother is going to pick OP over his wife and kids, you\u2019re delusional. Also you have no idea if brother told his wife this info. Could be this info came from their parents as justification for tossing out a pregnant 15 year old.", "If they weren't charged for it and they're in the US, they weren't drug tested. It's not standard everywhere.", "There has been a bunch of legal battles over this very thing in the US. Hospitals regularly test pregnant women without their consent even if they have no history of drug use."]}
