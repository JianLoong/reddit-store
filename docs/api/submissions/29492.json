Their dad left when oldest was 5 because we aren\u2019t worth the stress. I was terrified because we were about to be homeless but I managed to find a job.  \n\nI hadn\u2019t seen my family since they cut me off for getting pregnant as a teenager but my older brother found me and made me move in with him and his family. We live in their basement rent free and it\u2019s more than enough. \n\nI feel a little awkward around his wife and kids (he has two preteen daughters) but they\u2019re always nice to me and my kids when we see each other. \n\nWell it was my brother\u2019s birthday yesterday and we were all upstairs having dinner. My brother left the house to get something so he wasn\u2019t home for a bit. My son accidentally spilled juice on himself so I took him to get cleaned. He then got all worked up and tired so I quickly put him to bed. My daughters came down as well and I sat with them for a bit till they slept. After all that, I was going back upstairs and heard SIL+nieces talking about me.\n\n\u201cDid she really get pregnant at 15?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and look how she ended up. She\u2019s lucky your dad is so kind because you know she was pretty much homeless before we took her in\u2026 you guys better not get pregnant, I don\u2019t want you to end up like her.\u201d \n\nI mean, my situation is pretty pathetic and it\u2019s true I\u2019m lucky my brother found me. So I was just gonna ignore her. But then she started telling the girls my entire life story. Again, ok but she was telling them some embarrassing details and making me out to be a horrible human being. She told them I did drugs while pregnant (not true), she told them I probably have mental illness X and X (I don\u2019t), and she told them that I was probably going to abandon my kids or give them up if my brother hadn\u2019t found me. Her kids both went \u201cOh yeah I can see her doing that, she doesn\u2019t seem entirely there\u201d\n\nIt hurt really bad to hear how badly they thought of me and I regret telling my brother and SIL what happened to me. I know I\u2019m not a role model and probably should be ashamed of myself, but I didn\u2019t think they thought so lowly of me. \n\nI just went to bed and thought about ignoring it but now I\u2019m wondering if I should tell my brother. It\u2019s childish and petty of me, right? I feel like it\u2019d be pretty to go crying to my brother about his wife and kids. I just don\u2019t know if I can look any of them in the eye anymore but I don\u2019t want to risk being kicked out. WIBTA if I told my brother what they said and potentially start a fight or argument or at least stress them out?

However, I don't appreciate the embellishments to my story. I never used drugs while pregnant and I do not suffer any mental illnesses.

Tell him because if that was my wife saying stuff about my sister, I would want to know and I'd show her the door personally. That's straight rude of the wife to do.
