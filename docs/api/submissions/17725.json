He was with her mom Emma from when they were 14 till 19. They had Sophie when they were 18 and they weren\u2019t \u201ctogether\u201d but they were messing around until I came along. I have been with my husband for 3 almost 4 years and we have been married for a year with a 9mo daughter and I\u2019m currently 15 weeks pregnant with another daughter. \n\nI love Sophie to death I really do, I view her as my own and treat her like so which has been perfectly okay and completely encouraged by my in laws and husband and me and Sophie have an amazing bond. This Christmas we are supposed to be going to California to go visit my extended in laws with Sophie, my 2 daughters, my MIL, FIL, SIL, and 2 BIL, so that the girls can meet their great grandma and all of their cousins around the same age. The plan is to go there and stay at johns great grandmas house because she had just moved into a huge house with multiple rooms and I\u2019ve been excited and planning this trip for my husband and girls for awhile. \n\nWell yesterday I was hanging out with my MIL grocery shopping and she casually mentions that Emma is planning on coming on the trip but nothing has been set in stone. I ask questions about living arrangements and she\u2019s supposed to be staying with all of us in johns great grandmas house, John knew nothing about this btw. I get upset and tell her that I am not okay with that and it feels disrespectful to bring her with us to stay in the same house as johns wife and expect us to act like a happy little family when this is not her family anymore and never will be and I understand she\u2019s Sophie\u2019s mom but that\u2019s all she is, nothing more nothing less and if she\u2019s going to bring her along then me and my 2 girls won\u2019t go. Instantly my MIL snaps at me that I\u2019m a selfish ungrateful bitch and I hav no right to put them in that situation and she\u2019s as much as family as I am which I do not agree with and we just argued until she took me home and things have been tense since. \n\nI am in no way trying to get in the way of Sophie and Emma\u2019s relationship and I\u2019m not trying to replace Emma, we get along now but there were problems in the past of her not giving John his court ordered parenting time which is why I am so adamant about her not coming for Christmas. John has never been allowed to have Sophie for Christmas until this year when we kept threatening court and so she finally buckled down and I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for her to impose that way when it\u2019s the first year having her. I also think it\u2019s straight disrespectful to treat me and her like we are the same, she is johns past, I feel that she is not the one married to John so she is not part of johns family. So, AITA for telling my MIL if my husbands baby mama goes on vacation with us then I will not go?\n\nEdit: my husband fully agrees with me and says he wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with her going either and he will not go either if his mom is going to let her impose on his first Christmas with his daughter and get in the way of his court ordered parenting time.\n\nEdit: Christmas vacation IS our court ordered time, on all odd years we are supposed to get the first half of Christmas break, which is the first 11 days and that\u2019s when the trip is. That\u2019s like John asking to go on their trip to Florida this summer with Emma\u2019s mom and grandma, it\u2019s not right and it\u2019s imposing on specific time that was set out for us", "created_utc": 1684576007, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13mnj52/aita_for_telling_my_mil_if_my_husbands_baby_mama/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I lost all respect for at that point.  I would not be surprised if MIL invited Emma knowing that this would push your buttons.  She sounds quite loathsome.\n\nThe fact it is not etched in stone, means there is time to rectify the problem.  Hindsight is always 20/20.  You reacted (perhaps too strongly) and MIL went off the deep end.  It is now time to have husband deal with his mother. I would also not be surprised if your MIL invited Emma, since she is the one who brought it up.\n\nI would not be surprised if Emma would be relieved not to go. She won't know most of the people there.  Really who wants to spend Christmas with the ex's family who they do not know?\n\nIt is not about who is ranked in the family... MIL is entitled to see things as she wants.  You are entitled to see things differently.  It is time for MIL to have compassion instead of being \"right\" and perhaps you as well.  I don't know.\n\nMy grandmother used to say, you can be right or you can be happy.  Meaning you spend all your energy on being right or you can relax and know on the inside you are right. There are times when you need to stand up and be respected.  Only you know if this is that time, reflect and think what is really important to you. If this truly important, then get your husband on your page and have him deal with it.  Hopefully, his own mother will listen to him.", "Of course you are not going with her. This is horrible.
