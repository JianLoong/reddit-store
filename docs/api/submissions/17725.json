He was with her mom Emma from when they were 14 till 19. They had Sophie when they were 18 and they weren\u2019t \u201ctogether\u201d but they were messing around until I came along. I have been with my husband for 3 almost 4 years and we have been married for a year with a 9mo daughter and I\u2019m currently 15 weeks pregnant with another daughter. \n\nI love Sophie to death I really do, I view her as my own and treat her like so which has been perfectly okay and completely encouraged by my in laws and husband and me and Sophie have an amazing bond. This Christmas we are supposed to be going to California to go visit my extended in laws with Sophie, my 2 daughters, my MIL, FIL, SIL, and 2 BIL, so that the girls can meet their great grandma and all of their cousins around the same age. The plan is to go there and stay at johns great grandmas house because she had just moved into a huge house with multiple rooms and I\u2019ve been excited and planning this trip for my husband and girls for awhile. \n\nWell yesterday I was hanging out with my MIL grocery shopping and she casually mentions that Emma is planning on coming on the trip but nothing has been set in stone. I ask questions about living arrangements and she\u2019s supposed to be staying with all of us in johns great grandmas house, John knew nothing about this btw. I get upset and tell her that I am not okay with that and it feels disrespectful to bring her with us to stay in the same house as johns wife and expect us to act like a happy little family when this is not her family anymore and never will be and I understand she\u2019s Sophie\u2019s mom but that\u2019s all she is, nothing more nothing less and if she\u2019s going to bring her along then me and my 2 girls won\u2019t go. Instantly my MIL snaps at me that I\u2019m a selfish ungrateful bitch and I hav no right to put them in that situation and she\u2019s as much as family as I am which I do not agree with and we just argued until she took me home and things have been tense since. \n\nI am in no way trying to get in the way of Sophie and Emma\u2019s relationship and I\u2019m not trying to replace Emma, we get along now but there were problems in the past of her not giving John his court ordered parenting time which is why I am so adamant about her not coming for Christmas. John has never been allowed to have Sophie for Christmas until this year when we kept threatening court and so she finally buckled down and I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for her to impose that way when it\u2019s the first year having her. I also think it\u2019s straight disrespectful to treat me and her like we are the same, she is johns past, I feel that she is not the one married to John so she is not part of johns family. So, AITA for telling my MIL if my husbands baby mama goes on vacation with us then I will not go?\n\nEdit: my husband fully agrees with me and says he wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with her going either and he will not go either if his mom is going to let her impose on his first Christmas with his daughter and get in the way of his court ordered parenting time.\n\nEdit: Christmas vacation IS our court ordered time, on all odd years we are supposed to get the first half of Christmas break, which is the first 11 days and that\u2019s when the trip is. That\u2019s like John asking to go on their trip to Miami this summer with Emma\u2019s mom and grandma, it\u2019s not right and it\u2019s imposing on specific time that was set out for us", "created_utc": 1684576007, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13mnj52/aita_for_telling_my_mil_if_my_husbands_baby_mama/", "score": 1831, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s huge a house, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re asking you to share a bedroom. If she stays in a hotel and Sophie wants her mom are you prepared to deal with Sophie wanting to go to the hotel instead? And either stay separate from the rest of the family or potentially melt down because she wants her mom who was banished across town?\n\nEmma will ALWAYS be a part of this family. So will you. She\u2019s Sophie\u2019s mom. She will always be Sophie\u2019s mom. That won\u2019t change. Her being a part of the family because of their daughter in no way threatens your position as John\u2019s wife. She has been attached to this family in one form out another for a decade at this point. There is a child involved, you can\u2019t expect others to just cut her out and erase their history with Emma just because John got married. That\u2019s why your MIL got defensive. Look past the words she was using, what do you think she was feeling when she was lashing out at you?\n\nWhat do you think Sophie would want? To be states away for an extended period in a strange house with a bunch of new people, get homesick, and miss her mom on Christmas?  To possibly find out and remember for the rest of her life the only reason Emma was disinvited was because you didn\u2019t want her there? Or to have her mom there along with her siblings, you, her dad, and the and the rest of her family and remember how great it was that her most important people were together during the holidays?\n\nYou have the choice to be the bigger person. If you always think of Sophie first, before yourself, in these situations it will be infinitely better for all of you going forward.", "NTA. I stopped reading when your MIL called you a bitch.", "Never ever stay with family if there are issues. Always get a hotel or air bnb.

You will still have Sophie for Christmas, and Emma is not alone.   \n\n\nHowever I would probably still tried and fight for a non Emma Christmas, maybe talk with the some of the family members and see what they think, but your husband needs to take the lead and either tell his mother that it is either Emma or his family, or tell Emma that she can't go.", "Have your husband contact her ex and tell her he will complain to the court about her trying to come along on the time he has custody.", "Sounds like MIL is trying to assert dominance and showing you who she'd rather have for a DIL.

John has also said no so you're definitely not in the wrong\n\nSpending one Christmas alone after getting the first 5 to herself isn't going to kill her, she's the ex and shouldn't be invited to family events like the break up was clean and you're all besties, she didn't even consider her own sons feelings just her own so she's being very disrespectful to him after what's he's had to do to get that time with his daughter", "NTA, while I will say you don't have any right to tell your MIL who should and should not be considered family.

There's a bit of E S H going on, but in this case, you're well within your rights to not want to spend a holiday you literally had to fight for with the person you had to fight with. It'll be better for everyone to have time apart and get used to the new routine. If you want to work on sharing events with the mom, start with something you didn't fight over, like a birthday or just a big family picnic or park outing. \n\nAs other have said, Emma is family for Sophie and John and his extended family. That doesn't mean she has to be part of your family. That does mean that she will continue to interact with you all. That does mean she will be important to someone you love (Sophie). Set your boundaries. Be willing to be considerate or generous when you feel safe doing so. \n\nAlso, fwiw, MIL is the big AH in this situation. Emma is not necessary for Sophie's first Christmas with your family, especially with her having fought to keep her from John for the holidays this long and over this issue specifically. Especially given the issues you've had with postpartum before, create a safe environment for you. You'll likely need the support and if you don't, it's better to be safe. Remember. You matter. And you can do hard things.", "My head hurts a little from all the family relationship maths. John is 24 now and has a living great grandmother, a grandmother who hasn't met your baby yet, a mother, a father, a wife he married at age 23 who was six months pregnant at the wedding, a daughter he had at age 18, and he got his wife pregnant again when his second baby was only six months old. Your husband is a busy man from a family that either is extremely long-living or likes to have as little time as possible between the generations. I suppose his parents are in their 40s, his grandparents in their 60s, and his great-grandmother in her 80s.\n\nNow I got all that sorted out, YTA. It was fine for you to not want Emma's mother on the trip, fine for you to talk to your husband about it, and fine for him to tell his parents he doesn't want her there. It wasn't your place though to complain to his mother, because they're his parents, not yours.\n\nYou don't mention how old you are, but for my own sanity I'm going to assume you're at least as old as your husband. You're at least 24, and so it's time to grow up. When something bothers you, talk about it with who you are supposed to talk about it, stay in your own lane when it's not your relationship, and wherever possible choose inclusion and peace.", "This post reeks of missing details and context we\u2019ll never be privy to on the internet.
