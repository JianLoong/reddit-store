So it seems that MIL and Emma planned this with nobody else\u2019s approval. She was on my side saying it was disrespectful and she\u2019s not going to let her impose on johns first Christmas with Sophie and she thinks it\u2019s weird Emma even wants to come in the first place. So she is not letting that happen. I\u2019m honestly relieved. Thank you all for the judgement. Most of you said I\u2019m not the asshole and it makes me feel good to be validated. I appreciate you all so much!\n\nAlright so, I\u2019m not gonna say much back story besides my husband, John (fake names) has a 6 year old daughter, Sophie, from a previous relationship. He was with her mom Emma from when they were 14 till 19. They had Sophie when they were 18 and they weren\u2019t \u201ctogether\u201d but they were messing around until I came along. I have been with my husband for 3 almost 4 years and we have been married for a year with a 9mo daughter and I\u2019m currently 15 weeks pregnant with another daughter. \n\nI love Sophie to death I really do, I view her as my own and treat her like so which has been perfectly okay and completely encouraged by my in laws and husband and me and Sophie have an amazing bond. This Christmas we are supposed to be going to California to go visit my extended in laws with Sophie, my 2 daughters, my MIL, FIL, SIL, and 2 BIL, so that the girls can meet their great grandma and all of their cousins around the same age. The plan is to go there and stay at johns great grandmas house because she had just moved into a huge house with multiple rooms and I\u2019ve been excited and planning this trip for my husband and girls for awhile. \n\nWell yesterday I was hanging out with my MIL grocery shopping and she casually mentions that Emma is planning on coming on the trip but nothing has been set in stone. I ask questions about living arrangements and she\u2019s supposed to be staying with all of us in johns great grandmas house, John knew nothing about this btw. I get upset and tell her that I am not okay with that and it feels disrespectful to bring her with us to stay in the same house as johns wife and expect us to act like a happy little family when this is not her family anymore and never will be and I understand she\u2019s Sophie\u2019s mom but that\u2019s all she is, nothing more nothing less and if she\u2019s going to bring her along then me and my 2 girls won\u2019t go. Instantly my MIL snaps at me that I\u2019m a selfish ungrateful bitch and I hav no right to put them in that situation and she\u2019s as much as family as I am which I do not agree with and we just argued until she took me home and things have been tense since. \n\nI am in no way trying to get in the way of Sophie and Emma\u2019s relationship and I\u2019m not trying to replace Emma, we get along now but there were problems in the past of her not giving John his court ordered parenting time which is why I am so adamant about her not coming for Christmas. John has never been allowed to have Sophie for Christmas until this year when we kept threatening court and so she finally buckled down and I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for her to impose that way when it\u2019s the first year having her. I also think it\u2019s straight disrespectful to treat me and her like we are the same, she is johns past, I feel that she is not the one married to John so she is not part of johns family. So, AITA for telling my MIL if my husbands baby mama goes on vacation with us then I will not go?\n\nEdit: my husband fully agrees with me and says he wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with her going either and he will not go either if his mom is going to let her impose on his first Christmas with his daughter and get in the way of his court ordered parenting time.\n\nEdit: Christmas vacation IS our court ordered time, on all odd years we are supposed to get the first half of Christmas break, which is the first 11 days and that\u2019s when the trip is. That\u2019s like John asking to go on their trip to Miami this summer with Emma\u2019s mom and grandma, it\u2019s not right and it\u2019s imposing on specific time that was set out for us\n\nFinal edit: we talked to johns great grandma and she had NO idea these plans were in place and she was not happy about it. So it seems that MIL and Emma planned this with nobody else\u2019s approval. She was on my side saying it was disrespectful and she\u2019s not going to let her impose on johns first Christmas with Sophie and she thinks it\u2019s weird Emma even wants to come in the first place.

I got to meet my child's friends' parents, my child got a 3 hr play date with a friend. We listened to music. Decorated houses. Parents had to stay with their child and decorate.

My mom still insisted on inviting him to birthdays, holidays, etc. despite my discomfort. \n\nSo I finally sat my family down and said that they are all autonomous independent adults who can choose to invite whomever they wish to events they host.

My mom continued to invite my ex-husband, and as I had informed them, I did not attend. This went on for years. My mom showed me with her actions that she valued my ex-husband over my comfort, and as a result, I had to come to terms that my mom is not, and truly never has been, a person who is emotionally safe for me. Sucks. \n\nEventually with practice I became much more comfortable setting boundaries about what treatment and behavior I would accept, and my mom and I have achieved a reasonable level of equilibrium in our relationship. \n\nShe still maintains a relationship with my ex-husband, as is her every right. And I still choose not to participate, as is my right. We do not connect deeply but do maintain a great surface-level relationship. \n\nOP, your husband needs to establish boundaries with his mom; it\u2019s not your job to do so.

All the people claiming Y T A  or E S H so far have all seemed to fail to grasp that Emma is encroaching on ***COURT ORDERED*** time for just John to have Sophie alone. Emma has no business being a part of that trip and could very well be found in breach of a court order if she went.", "NTA.\n\nEmma cant come. She may look like she 'caved' to giving John Christmas but by coming along she will be doing what is called 'infringing' on his time. Infringing is basically when one parent pushes themself into time with the child in the other parent's time.\n\nHere's an example of infringing from our RL - the Ex Baby Momma (EBM) RSVP'd for the Child on an event that was happening on the father's parenting night and told the Child about it. Then the EBM signed herself, her 2 kids and her 2 other baby daddies, up for the same event - and after all that was a done deal, told Father 1 about the event, making clear the Child knew the event was coming up and was excited about it, and by the way it's on father's time and EBM, at least one other baby daddy, and one of EBM's other kids and step kid would be there. Then that night, which was supposed to be father's night, turned into the father being forced to try to tag along with his kid while the EBM and her entire circus of stepkid, other kid, and other baby daddy were all circling around the same space together like a swirling vortex of crazy people straight from hell. It was the dad's night but EBM did her best to hover over Child (to the point of neglecting her stepkid and other kid) in order to shower individual attention on the Child and pull the Child over to sleepover by the mom instead of the dad, etc. EBM had the emotional manipulation dialed up to 11 - when in reality, she should have absented herself entirely if she was any type of decent person. This is what infringing can look like on the terrible end of it.\n\nI may be projecting but that's what I see happening here especially since you say Emma is the type of person to deny parenting time in the past PLUS John has never had Christmas before. She's trying to make sure she's still involved and has her daughter on the holiday. I can almost guarantee Emma  will monopolize her daughter if she is the type of woman to deny the father parenting time. She absolutely sounds like someone who is unwilling to let go, and/or has to be in control, since these problems you've had in the past are significant. It'll look something like you and John and your child sitting together on the couch, and maybe Emma and Sophie sitting together on the floor across the room; and John will be at most an observer rather than a participant in Sophie's Christmas. That's not fair to either of them.\n\nKnow this now: for some people, custody battles are games. And the prize you are playing for is *time*. Because time cannot be recouped once it has been stolen away. And time is what you need with a child to build that parent-child relationship. No time, and you will find it VERY difficult to build that relationship.\n\nEmma is playing a game with you, and right now I hate to say it but you haven't won the battle of John having Sophie for Christmas. Emma wants you to think she's giving you what you want based on the threat of going to court... until it's too late for you to actually do so and expect a result back by the Christmas deadline (family courts are notoriously backlogged). But she's behind the scenes weaseling away to get what she wants which is to continue to have her daughter on the holiday.\n\nShe can't come on this trip and quite frankly your MIL needs to be told if she supports Emma coming, she is choosing Emma over her own son. That your entire family - You, John, Sophie, your child and your future child, will absolutely not go on this family trip at all if Emma is coming. And you need to be ready to back that up; to the extent of if they give you lip service that okay, you win, we disinvite her - and you show up to find her there or she arrives, you pack up and leave immediately. Get refundable plane tickets when you book. Refundable EVERYTHING. Make it clear to all the family members - both the hosts and guests - that this is John's first Christmas with Sophie and it is special and he wants some daddy-daughter time and he is *overdue* for it, as a result of Emma's actions. See if you can get the hosts onside, if MIL is going to thwart you.\n\nIt's sick that Emma has an ally in your MIL to the point where she disdains you in Emma's favor - especially when Emma kept Sophie from MIL's son. Something is not right there that MIL is on Emma's side after that.\n\nA father absolutely has the right to have time alone with his child without an Ex being in his face. The reason people are EX's is that they don't get along. If they share a child the child has a right to a relationship with both parents, but the parents also have a right to separate lives and keeping only reasonably contact limited to coparenting. The goal is not for John and Emma to have enmeshed lived until Sophie is 18 - the goal is for them to have their own lives and reasonable levels of contact and communication revolving solely around co-parenting.\n\nALSO. Sophie needs to grow up knowing that her parents are separated and that is ok and they are each happy and love her and love their separate lives. Continuing this enmeshment is only going to confuse her and cause her pain and stress and anxiety if she is under the mistaken impression that her family could and should all be together but they're not and she is too young to understand why when she wants them to be together, they aren't. It's unhealthy and leads to many issues - emotional, behavioral, you get the idea.\n\nOr at least that's been my observational experience.", "So Emma finally has to let Sophie stay with you for Christmas...and then tries to horn in on the vacation. Clear power play.\n\nLet Emma and MIL take the trip while you and your husband enjoy the holiday with Sophie and your other children.", "NTA but you must realize that there are going to be occasions where Sophie will want all of her parents with her regardless of custody agreements. Has anyone asked Sophie how she feels about this?", "MIL is just testing you to see how far they can get away with. You have to stand your ground now more than ever to cancel any plans they have for the future.", "I totally understand Emma wanting to be with her daughter on Christmas but it is not normal to tag along with your ex's family on their family vacation.  Sounds like your MIL likes Emma better than you and is trying to keep Emma in her life.  Very strange situation all around.  NTA", "[removed]", "I think that makes it ESH. It\u2019s reasonable that OP and her husband would want their own parent time, but she became the asshole when she told her MIL Emma wasn\u2019t family to her MIL and was just some woman from her husband\u2019s past. By her own account Emma and her husband were together for years and dealt with a teen pregnancy together. She\u2019s the mother of his child. Of course his family has a familial relationship with her! And they\u2019re completely allowed to! In fact, it\u2019s probably better for Sophie if her mom is treated as family by the extended family. \n\nAgain, I can understand your discomfort with her coming on this trip, especially if you\u2019re insecure about your place in the family, but you don\u2019t get to dictate your extended family\u2019s feelings toward someone they\u2019ve had a long relationship with.", "Her, she is VERY quick to jump the gun and become defensive and mean", "Since when?

MIL probably assumed that Emma, John, and Sophie would wind up a nice little family, and she\u2019s known Emma since she was a literal child herself.  Of COURSE she likes her more than OP.", "Something tells me that OP is what broke Emma and John up.  As she even says, they were still having sex until she came on the scene.

Everybody's ignoring what might be the best for the child because they're too busy hogging her and trying to decide who's valid enough to be considered family. The immaturity is reeking.", "I'm sure the child will miss mom, but are very excited for a big trip. It's his court ordered time, the mother should not be around unless it's mandatory for supervision. These rules are put in place to protect the child. She says she gets along great with the 6 year old. I'm sure the kid adores her too. The evil step mom thing is overplayed. You never see people talking about how great their step parents can be, because those don't make good stories. What's best for the child is that she doesn't see her parents fighting and being uncomfortable and ruining everything, and making the child feel like it's all their fault the fighting is happening.\nThe kid is a child of divorce. There is no right way to do it that won't effect the child in some way. But creating the least amount of tension should be the goal. Making it easiest on the child also means making it easy for her to be cared for properly while in the care of whatever parent has current custody", "Her previous posts about how her husband doesn't like her and is only still with her because he doesn't want two kids with two baby mamas and not being with either of them. The fact that they were fighting so bad she was on her way to kill herself. That she clearly regrets being locked down and not having a normal youth.\n\nI don't think it's a stretch at all.", "All due respect, im close to 10 years in with My \"not serious high school relationship\". Our second child is due in 4 weeks", "Relationships only get serious when you're both in the real world, not in high school. So if you were dating for ten years, and if you've dated since freshman year high school, you've only been serious for six.\n\nHigh school is when everything is easy. Your parents provide for you and you don't have to bear the responsibility of bills or jobs or anything of the sort. You're still figuring yourself out at that age, it's impossible to really know someone for who they are until after graduation when the real world hits, at the absolute earliest.", "NTA Start with, and you might really need this, \"Grateful for what?\" Make sure you know what she thinks she's done for which you should be grateful. This sounds potentially like a JNMIL situation. There are issues with the ex, but your primary problem is MIL.", "NTA (mostly) - I don't think Emma should be invited on the vacation, and it is disrespectful. However, if she does come, don't ruin the vacation and Christmas by refusing not to go.", "NTA, Your MIL calling you a bitch to your face is a big problem though.", "It's been considered derogatory for a long time. Just because you've heard it a lot doesn't make it a good term.", "Is baby mama who John was cheating with during the beginning of your relationship?  Does MIL want those two back together?  You mentioned in a previous post just a few months ago that you were not in a good place due to how he treats you and you came back after he called you and at that time he didn\u2019t want two kids and not be with one of the mothers.  \n\nNot saying he wanted her on this trip but I\u2019m curious as what there relationship looks like when you\u2019re not around, especially if just a month ago you felt you were forcing monogamy on him.\n\nEither way NTA", ">Ok NTA but\u2026 I\u2019m irked when you say she isn\u2019t family like you are. She is Sophie\u2019s mum.\n\nShe's Sophie's mum, but that doesn't make her part of John's family. I disagree that she is *just* as important as OP is - she can be an important figure in their lives, but OP is their daughter-in-law. Sophie is the mother of their grandchild/niece/cousin. Very different relationships."]}
