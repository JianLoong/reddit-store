He was with her mom Emma from when they were 14 till 19. They had Sophie when they were 18 and they weren\u2019t \u201ctogether\u201d but they were messing around until I came along. I have been with my husband for 3 almost 4 years and we have been married for a year with a 9mo daughter and I\u2019m currently 15 weeks pregnant with another daughter. \n\nI love Sophie to death I really do, I view her as my own and treat her like so which has been perfectly okay and completely encouraged by my in laws and husband and me and Sophie have an amazing bond. This Christmas we are supposed to be going to California to go visit my extended in laws with Sophie, my 2 daughters, my MIL, FIL, SIL, and 2 BIL, so that the girls can meet their great grandma and all of their cousins around the same age. The plan is to go there and stay at johns great grandmas house because she had just moved into a huge house with multiple rooms and I\u2019ve been excited and planning this trip for my husband and girls for awhile. \n\nWell yesterday I was hanging out with my MIL grocery shopping and she casually mentions that Emma is planning on coming on the trip but nothing has been set in stone. I ask questions about living arrangements and she\u2019s supposed to be staying with all of us in johns great grandmas house, John knew nothing about this btw. I get upset and tell her that I am not okay with that and it feels disrespectful to bring her with us to stay in the same house as johns wife and expect us to act like a happy little family when this is not her family anymore and never will be and I understand she\u2019s Sophie\u2019s mom but that\u2019s all she is, nothing more nothing less and if she\u2019s going to bring her along then me and my 2 girls won\u2019t go. Instantly my MIL snaps at me that I\u2019m a selfish ungrateful bitch and I hav no right to put them in that situation and she\u2019s as much as family as I am which I do not agree with and we just argued until she took me home and things have been tense since. \n\nI am in no way trying to get in the way of Sophie and Emma\u2019s relationship and I\u2019m not trying to replace Emma, we get along now but there were problems in the past of her not giving John his court ordered parenting time which is why I am so adamant about her not coming for Christmas. John has never been allowed to have Sophie for Christmas until this year when we kept threatening court and so she finally buckled down and I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for her to impose that way when it\u2019s the first year having her. I also think it\u2019s straight disrespectful to treat me and her like we are the same, she is johns past, I feel that she is not the one married to John so she is not part of johns family. So, AITA for telling my MIL if my husbands baby mama goes on vacation with us then I will not go?\n\nEdit: my husband fully agrees with me and says he wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with her going either and he will not go either if his mom is going to let her impose on his first Christmas with his daughter and get in the way of his court ordered parenting time.\n\nEdit: Christmas vacation IS our court ordered time, on all odd years we are supposed to get the first half of Christmas break, which is the first 11 days and that\u2019s when the trip is. That\u2019s like John asking to go on their trip to Florida this summer with Emma\u2019s mom and grandma, it\u2019s not right and it\u2019s imposing on specific time that was set out for us", "created_utc": 1684576007, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13mnj52/aita_for_telling_my_mil_if_my_husbands_baby_mama/", "score": 381, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Where I am the other parent has to give permission to take the child out-of-state (it doesn't matter if the time is court ordered, you have to stay in state). Has Emma given permission to take Sophie without her and if not, is she likely to even do that?", "INFO: is this the same MIL who called CPS for \u2018no reason\u2019 then another sub had to explain to you allll of the reasons she was right??\n\nYou\u2019re 21/22 with 1.5 kids and I\u2019m guessing this MIL is the one who called CPS on you as well (the comments there paint an interesting view of your parenting). People who are actually as mature as your statements claim would be assessing this very differently.", "No mil likes the baby momma more then op and is trying to stir the pot!", "The fact that she\u2019s kept the daughter away from her dad on his court appointed holidays makes me think her reason for wanting to go (if she does want to) could be as much about interfering with John's holiday time with Sophie as it would be about spending the time together herself.\n\nie. a mindset of \"if I can't have her all to myself for the holiday, neither can you\"\n\nIf she were of that mindset, there are so many ways that she could make it feel like it's not John's christmas holiday with Sophie, with everyone staying together the MILs proposing. And with what OP has commented about the MIL, the MIL would probably end up facilitating, if not outright assisting, in the interference.\n\nAnd as tough as it has been for John not having Sophie with him for the previous christmases that he was supposed to get, being together but having Emma there and constantly interfering with his plans for things to do and his ability to spend that time with his daughter could be almost worse.\n\nThis is not to say that I don't think wanting to be with hee daughter wouldn't be a reason for Emma to be wanting to come along. I just don't think it would be the only reason.", "You might be right... I do not know. Hopefully the situation gets resolved.", "How is her being there taking from that??\n\nAgain I ask, if everything\u2019s is now cool, what is the harm in her also being there for Christmas with her child?\n\nIf you and your husband don\u2019t make it (which based on your post history..), would you not want to see your kids on the holiday if you had the chance?", "And she gave birth to MILs granddaughter! How is that not family???", "Oh yeah I didn\u2019t realise idly was court orderd to be with dad only. My bad!", "We took it to court and presented evidence of her refusing time on multiple occasions and showing that the vacation days are strictly scheduled on our days and in no way interferes so the judge stated it was okay to take her out of state since it will be in a trusted house and because this would be her first Christmas with her siblings.", "I said the reason multiple times, on countless occasions she has disrespected me and when my daughter was first born I kept her from her and she called cps because of it. The case got dropped very easily after one house visit and my daughter is thriving, currently watching bluey and playing with her piano actually. \n\nYou do not know the situation, my MIL is horrible, threw us out homeless while I was 28 weeks pregnant all over dinner. There\u2019s no reflection on my parenting.", "\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40", "Me too.  Poor kid.", "I don't think it's fair to expect OP and her husband to spend the holiday with someone who they have an obviously contentious relationship with. They had to take the mom to court because she wasn't following the original agreement, she was breaking the law. She had 4 uninterrupted Christmas with her daughter, she can allow her ex to have one. Is it better for the girl to spend quality time with her dad and his family, or to spend Christmas with 3 adults glaring at each other and fighting?", "Not if nobody else wanted me there. I know when I\u2019m invited and when I\u2019m not. My husband and I\u2019s relationship is great so don\u2019t make so many assumptions off of one or two comments", "She is the past most people are cordial to the ex but they don\u2019t vacation with the ex or share holidays.  They are co parents and need healthy boundaries. \n\nIt\u2019s not up to the mil to decide if op and her husband want to she are his parenting time.", "so why do you and your husband keep your MIL/his mother in your lives at all? She seems to be a force for evil.", "Oh my god, I'm shocked you're still in contact with her at all after that stunt! Is your husband not willing to cut her off?", "I mean a 9 month old shouldnt be watching any tv.\n\nAnd pregnancies so close together are a bad idea.\n\nOh wow checked your comment history. So you tested positive for thc (illegal in your state) while pregnant? Definitely parent of the year", "Then they can stay home! No one is making them come on the trip! Her presence at a third party event doesn't count as infringing on parenting time.", "Because conflict gives her the option for more points of control over multiple people, and for more ways to make herself the center of attention. If everyone is getting along fine, there\u2019s no conflict to exploit, no drama to make all about her, and no reason for anyone to pay any attention to MIL.", "We all want to know!", "I\u2019m very low contact but she helps my husband out a lot with rides since our vehicle stopped working. He has no other family in our state and if he cuts off his mom he loses access to his siblings who are all under 18 which he doesn\u2019t want", "9 month old can definitely watch TV. That's why baby and toddler TV programmes exist. Don't gate keep parenting. Or pregnancy for that matter. It's not ideal, but it happens.", "They can stay home and keep all 3 girls with them and mil and the ex can go on the trip. Which is exactly what I would do\n\n\nAnd it does interfere with thier parenting time when it\u2019s a Christmas vacation that they have fought years for. Mil and the ex found a loop hole. I would not let them. The 6 year old has the right to spend time and have Christmas with dad and his family with out the ex hovering. I wonder if she would share her time during Christmas with dad and his family? My guess is no!\n\nI am also willing to bet that dad, op and all three girls don\u2019t go then the ex will loose interest. This is just away to interfere with dads parenting time", "That makes sense then why he has to keep contact with her. But she sounds awful, I'm sorry you have to deal with her.", "Of course they can. Doesn't mean it is good for them. I work in Early Intervention. \n\nOP says there is no reflection on her parenting. There absolutely is", "and op doesn\u2019t have to spend the whole holiday with a woman (mil) who talks to her like that. nta"]}
