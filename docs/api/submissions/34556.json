Don\u2019t \u201cpass along messages\u201d.  This isn\u2019t your problem-and I don\u2019t care who Anna was impregnated by or who she married. \n\nAnna isn\u2019t married to *you*. Anna isn\u2019t your problem. If Anna has anything to say to your husband, she can say it herself. \n\nNTA for declining the golden opportunity to get involved in the soap opera of a family-even more than you already are.", "NTA. \n\nYour brother, your parents and you were family. But then you and your brother created your own families. Now you and Quinn are one family; whilst Anna and your brother are another family. Anna and you are only family (and extended at that) if you both say so. Do you want to be her family? \n\nWhy does Anna want to instigate a relationship with her married ex who she cheated on/ BIL by marriage? What is she trying to achieve here??? (Cynical me thinks it\u2019s a manipulation tactic to show people how she is trying and you to are refusing to let go and/or once again she gets to enjoy Quinn\u2019s attentions/ cause him pain).", "I think you are on the right about not seeing A there. Your decision, she messed up there are consequences.\nAs for not passing A messages, I'll say that you could let your husband an opportunity to make his own decision. But as he probably also avoid her at family reunion, since you are together + she could contact him herself: NTA", "NTA\n\nI will say, think about how you want this to be going forward. It's something you a Quinn should discuss. Because although Anna is in thew wrong, the reality is that she will continue to be at family events, and your family will likely continue to welcome her.", "Your whole situation is so messy. I don't think there's a right or wrong. It's just very convoluted and tainted.", "NTA. If she wants to reach out, she can reach out to him directly. It's not your job to repair what she broke. Best case, you can let your husband know that she said she wants to talk to him and stop there.", "NTA. You can make sure you are making the right choice by asking your husband - if Anna and your brother want to connect with him, would he want to build back bridges or is he fine with staying no contact. This will give you the answer if what you are doing is right or not. \n\nYour family should be reminded that Anna and your brother destroyed a 10-year-long relationship by cheating for who knows how long and came clean only when a baby was going to be born. Some of them seem to might have forgotten that.", "Nta", "NTA. Don't let others make you the go-between on this - it's nothing more than manipulation. Your interference in your husband's decisions wouldn't be welcome, I can guarantee. \n\nIf Anna and your brother want to make amends, it starts with them, not with you or any other family member.", "NTA\n\nIf anna wants to try and mend fences, she can take the direct approach.  \n\nTho, to be frank about it,  you wouldn't be  TA if you \\_did\\_ pass on the message .  It seems to me this is one of those decisions to go with whatever you feel better about.  You don't want  to , so thats pretty much that.    \n\n family reunions must be a laugh riot.", "Your loyalty is to your husband. Your friend made her bed. She can sleep in it.", "NTA. Your husband deserves to know about the message, but maybe save the 'surprise, you have a long-lost child' plot for a soap opera.", "I think you should tell him, it's better coming from you than anyone else.\n\nHow do you think your Quinn will feel if he found out you didn't pass along the message? Doesn't he get a say in his own life?\n\nHe's already had an ex that cheated on him and let him believe for a while that her baby was his, now he has a wife keeping things from him.", "Sooo Anna did nothing to you right.  She cheated on Quinn with your brother. You said you don't attend events if Anna is there but you will if your brother is?  Take Quinn out of it for a minute you are creating a rift relating to your brother and nephew/niece over something that doesn't involve you.  Now add Quinn - you realise you chose to date Quinn after all this?  After your brother married Anna and the baby was born.  So in my mind you are part of the problem you chose to date, marry and have a kid with someone who was wronged by your brother and his wife knowing it will create a rift in your own family bc he can't get over it to attend family events.  Your child's cousin is Anna's child.  After all this time and if Anna and your brother have not done anything further, I think you can be in the same space as your brother, his wife and child.  Ex-married people learn to be in same space after divorce due to cheating.  I can't understand you since noone did you anything.  I can't understand Quinn because he literally chose to be with you after all this so him joining your family creates problems if he can't figure out how to make it work.  If I were your family members (not brother and Anna) I would be annoyed at you.  YTA.", "Info: why did you not pass along the message? Does your husband still have feelings for her? Are you still in contact with your brother?", "Honestly, it sounds like you may be the AH. There\u2019s at least an ESH here. Anna was super shady to Quinn, but why would you start dating your friend\u2019s ex and marry him given this situation? It\u2019s super messy. Are you keeping the message away from Quinn because you\u2019re worried he still has feelings for Anna? Otherwise, why can\u2019t Quinn make his own decision about whether he wants to speak to her.", "It\u2019s wise to not play the messenger & refuse to get stuck in the middle of someone else\u2019s ...relationship? former relationship? Argument? So, NTA.  \n\n\nBut there\u2019s a possibility that the rest of your family isn\u2019t thrilled about your decisions to date and marry someone who has such a HUGE reason to resent someone who\u2019s already become part of the family. You must\u2019ve realized before you married that family gatherings would always be tense and/or you\u2019d have to bow out of them. For you, your husband is worth it!  But don\u2019t expect -for example- your mom to be happy that she can\u2019t ever have all her kids together with her on Thanksgiving again. Even if they really like your husband, they might kinda wonder why you had to go and complicate things by choosing him of all people.  (If they\u2019re smart, they\u2019d never say that out loud.) \n\n  \nI\u2019m not saying you were wrong for any of that!  Just fishing for explanations for why your fam  feels like you\u2019re TA.  but regardless- they\u2019re dreaming if they think that you passing that message to Quinn would\u2019ve somehow fixed things between him & Anna.", "The truth, is that you are TA for not giving your husband the message. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why you are being blamed for tense family gatherings. \n\nIs everyone at your family gathering\u2019s aware that you were given a message from Anna to pass on to your husband and you refuse to give him the message?  \n\nIf you\u2019ve told your family about the message you refuse to pass on to your husband, and they are scared they might slip, accidentally telling your husband, which is why there is tension at family gatherings - that is why they blame you for being the cause of all that tension. Do you agree with this explanation as to why they blame you?  Do you believe your family is right to blame you?\n\nWhat if your husband was supposed to pass a message on to you from someone BUT instead he decided NOT to. How would you feel about it?\n\nNo relationship, especially marriage, can survive without both being able to trust, be honesty, have faith and believe in each other. Its what the foundation of a healthy, happy, fulfilling marriage and relationship thrives.\n\nIf your husband were to finds out the truth from someone else, how do you think he will react, respond? How will he feel towards you? What will he think about this kept secret?  How will it make him feel about you, your family, the marriage, his trust in you? \n\nI think you should give your husband that message and hope he never finds out how long you\u2019ve had  that message before giving it to him. Just as you only deserve the truth from your husband, your husband only deserves the truth from his wife. Is keeping this message from him, worth damaging your marriage?\n\nI wish you all the best:)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
