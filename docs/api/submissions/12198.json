For context my friend (42M) his gf (48F) and their two friends (also mid 40's M&F) were hosting this party the **4 of them together.** \n\nA few weeks ago when I received the invitation I realized that it said on it something along the lines of \"please be prepared to purchase your own drinks\". Didn't think much of it at the time considering I just thought they were hiring a bar tender or something, but fast forward to the day of the party.\n\nI arrive with my wife and it's my friend and his gf standing behind their kitchen counter that they were using as their \"bar\", making/charging the guests for drinks. Now I was confused for a few reasons... \n\n1, the fact that this party was held at my friends house, it's not like this was at an event space or something where this would be normal imo. 2, there was no bar tender that they hired or anything like that. It was literally 2 of the 4 of them standing in the kitchen at a time making drinks for people and then charging them accordingly (drinks were all under $10).\n\nNow idk if this is actually a common thing, but I have never in my 42 years of living been to a \"party\" at a friends house where the hosts are charging you themselves for drinks.\n\nI've had multiple parties over the years, that I have invited my friend and his gf to in which they have attended, and I've never charged **ANYONE** for drinks ever. I've always bought all the drinks myself and had an open bar type of situation. Where my guests can make there own drinks. I even had a proper bar tender once and still no one was charged, it was an open bar.\n\nI honestly felt like my friend, his gf and their friends were all trying to make a quick buck off of their guests who attended. Clearly to cover to cost of the drinks. Which yeah I understand that booze isn't cheap these days but we're talking splitting the cost of whatever they bought between **4 PEOPLE**. Like in my opinion if you can't afford to supply drinks at your party, why are you having a party in the first place? \n\nThis also wasn't for charity or anything the money made off of the drinks was for them to split.\n\nMy wife and I bought one drink each, stayed for about an hour or so, and said our goodbyes. When we were leaving my friend asked why we didn't have that much to drink? I told him because I think it's ridiculous that they are charging their close friends for drinks. He called me cheap and an unsupportive friend. I assured him that i'm not, if the charging of drinks was for a good cause (like profits go to charity or something) of course i'd buy drinks. \n\nI told him I find the fact that they are charging for drinks, and keeping the money for themselves ridiculous and taking advantage of their friends. Anyway now my friend and his gf are butt hurt about this and have been calling me an AH to our mutual friends.

If you're that cheap just ask people to BYOB. I am hosting St Patrick's Day dinner. I picked up a small bottle of Tanqueray for one of the guests that doesn't like wine or beer and it was $8. Profiteering off your friends at a Cocktail party? That's a new low", "NTA. The fact that your friend even confronted you about not drinking more says it all. What losers", "NTA and I'm in full agreement, they wanted to use this party as a way to make money off their friends and it's REALLY weird.", "NTA, and your friends' behavior is bizarre.  Just make the party BYO if you can't afford to provide drinks...", "NTA. Charging for drinks they make themselves is a super weird thing to do, and they can't expect you to be accepting of that. It just sounds like really bad host etiquette. If they couldn't afford the liquor, they should've just had a bring-your-own-drink party or something.\n(Edit: formatting issue)", "NTA but I wouldn't have bothered to explain my exit.  Pointless, arguing with a person who would do that in the first place.\n\nIf they can't afford to host, then they could have made it a BYOB. \"Cash bar\" in a private home is crazy.", "NTA and depending on the state/municipality, they may have been violating laws that require a liquor license to sell drinks.", "NTA at all. This is REALLY weird, and I'd be surprised if you were the only ones put off by it. If they can't cover the costs of all the food and drinks, the normal thing to do is to ask everyone to bring something. If they'd done this but reacted only with confusion when confronted, I would only say they were weird, not AHs. But calling you cheap and bad-mouthing you to others? They're definitely the AHs.", "NTA, Frankly it\u2019s just bizarre that they are stood there making drinks and charging Invited guests who happen to be friends for it. I think it\u2019s clearly about money for them because it would have been far less work for them just to ask people to bring their own booze. I just couldn\u2019t imagine actually pouring the drinks at my own party and taking money off friends, it\u2019s just so cringe. So yeah your not the arsehole but I kind of feel like unfortunately the kind of people who are ballsy enough to do that kind of thing, are probably the kind of people who will just never accept that they\u2019re in the wrong anyway.", "NTA. My problem came in when they expected you to drink more and got mad when you didn't.  It was 4 people.  Do they need the money for something?  Was this a charity dinner of sorts?  I don't understand the purpose of expectation of drinking a lot.  Did they spend their rent on drinks for a party of 4?  Yeah, it's weird. I would have done the same as you.", "NTA, this is ridiculous. Either byob or they supply it.", ">were all trying to make a quick buck off   \n  \nNTA - Honestly this seems like the only explanation that makes sense. I've never been to a party where the hosts charged for drinks. It's either weird or greedy", "NTA - I have never, ever heard of anyone doing that and find it a little strange.  If you can't afford to supply beverages, make it a \"bring your own\" type party and be done with it.", "NTA and your friend does need a lesson or two on not being cheap or selfish. If someone invites you to their home, you don't go there with an open wallet expecting to pay for drinks. If that was the case, why bother turning up at all as its just a poor quality bar and the friendship doesn't matter. They might as well invited everyone to a bar and had a good time with everyone buying a round of drinks than this stingy attempt to make some money.", "NTA.  Everything seemed fine until your \"friend\" called you out at the end for not drinking enough.  He's clearly not your friend, after all.

Any friends who take his side on this aren't worth having anyway.", "The logic of this could kind of make sense if it's like a party with kids wanting to play restaurant / waiter and serve bites. But then your friends are > 40. NTA.", "NTA\n\nThat is the weirdest thing I've ever heard. They are charging MORE than the cost, too, so it's not even about covering the costs.", "NTA - this is literally the most classless, gauche, unfriendly nonsense I've ever heard.", "This is so fucking weird, I can\u2019t even stand it. FOUR people got together and convinced themselves this was an OK thing to do and not one of those four had the wherewithal to be like \u201cuh, this is so fucking tacky and stupid?\u201d \n\nLike, in college, maybe MAYBE, you charge a cover or like \u201cpay $5 for a cup\u201d and that goes to the keg.\n\nI\u2019d be looking around for a bowl with keys in it, like what other throwback traditions are we doing, since clearly this isn\u2019t a party for 40 something\u2019s in 2023, it\u2019s some sort of bizarre time travel to a place where running a fake bar with a drink menu and a PRICE LIST in your house for a night is a normal thing.\n\nTHESE ARE PEOPLE IN THEIR FORTIES. I cannot get over this\u2026\n\nNTA \n\nAlso - I must know, was there a tip jar? Please say yes, because if they\u2019re gonna be this absurd I hope they went full out and asked for tips, too.", "NTA at at all. I wouldn't have paid for one drink under those weird circumstances.  Maybe it's time for your four friends to get side hustles.", "NTA, the reason byob exists is so the host doesn't have to supply all the alcohol. I can understand if one host was acting as bartender exclusively all night, maybe putting out a tip jar (I've seen this before, the person was an actual bartender by profession and was making fancy things and wasn't able to circulate the party because they were staying at the bar) but straight charging for drinks is insane.", "NTA\nThey were definitely trying to make money off their friends by playing \u201cbartender\u201d. They\u2019re strange for that.", "NTA  You both actually bought a drink and stayed for a while to mingle despite how uncomfortable the hosts were making the party and then they act like you're in the wrong. The whole situation was weird even with the warning or paying for drinks. What if people just decided not to drink at all would they have been kicked out. It seems more like they are trying to fund some vacation or something and are mad you aren't helping to pay for it. I'm not sure I would ever go to a party hosted by any of those 4 ever again.", "NTA this is super weird.  BYOB is perfectly reasonable.  If you're a student or under 25 a small cover charge for beer is acceptable.  Hiring a  bartender and letting them have a tip jar is perfectly acceptable.  What your friends are doing is really off putting and extremely cheap of them.", "Nta. If they couldn\u2019t afford the booze it could have just been byob.", "NTA. That\u2019s weird. If you want help paying for drinks just say something like \u201cplease bring your liquor of choice to share and we will provide mixers \u201c or something like that. Thats perfectly normal. Charging isn\u2019t", ">My wife and I bought one drink each, stayed for about an hour or so, and said our goodbyes. When we were leaving my friend asked why we didn't have that much to drink?\n\n\"Because we didn't want to\". \"Because we have things to do tomorrow and didn't want to be hungover\".  Any number of answers would be acceptable.\n\nNTA", "NTA, that definitley is not normal or common, and they make for pretty bad hosts for doing that. If they were so hung up about affording drinks they should have encouraged others to bring their own drinks or something, which is generally more acceptable\n\nAlso like others have said, what they were doing could be illegal depending on where they live, and if they have a liqour license. You normally can\u2019t just sell beer.", "NTA. What next? Come to dinner and pay for your meal?", "NTA. This is just strange", "Friends? Patrons!", "This is like going to a party and finding out it\u2019s a MLM scheme. You buy the cheapest candle/lingerie/makeup crap and awkwardly leave as soon as you can.", "NTA\n\nScreams of a quick money making scam using 'friendship' as an excuse. I have drinks with my coworkers/friends every so often and said friend preps some high quality liquor when we do. He never asked me to cough up a single cent.\n\nPretty scummy on their part.", "They definitely were having a fundraiser for something (for themselves, like the people helping people in Fred Claus), that\u2019s so weird.", "NTA\n\nThis sounds like they decided to use their party as a money making opportunity.   \nLeaving was a good move.", "NTA! OP, I agree with you completely. All your points are valid. This is wrong on multiple levels, mostly the taking advantage of friends to profit themselves. I bet most of the others in attendance agree this is crappy, even if they didn\u2019t speak up and played along  \n\nYour friend and his gf are are embarrassed they got called out. \n\nDon\u2019t throw a party of you can\u2019t afford to throw a party. Personally as someone who is no longer in their 20s, I don\u2019t even agree with BYOB. When I\u2019m hosting a party, my guests are fed and boozed on my dime.", "NTA and don't even think you are. Even for the fact that you spoke up. That situation is just strange. I don't think I'd hang out with them again.", "NTA - In my world, when someone doesn't want to or can't afford to provide booze for a party they send invites that say BYOB.", "NTA is this even legal? I thought you needed a license to sell booze? Sounds like your friends are starting a speakeasy. Next thing you know they'll be charging corkage for BYOB.", "NTA I\u2019ve heard of friends asking to venmo them some cash to cover booze/ food\u2026. But never a profit making scheme like this\u2026 wtf.", "NTA. This is super weird. Are they in financial trouble, and they thought this would be a good fundraiser? I'm surprised there wasn't a cover charge and two drink minimum. Did they also charge for parking?\n\nAny (alcohol) party we've been to or thrown has always been booze provided by the host. And inevitably, most guests also bring alcohol and/or food to share. Maybe next time you go,  BYOB.

Yikes", "They are selling without a liquor license.", "OMG. THEY TOLD YOU AHEAD OF TIME THEY WERE CHARGING FOR DRINKS. Don't like it? Don't go. \n\nI think it's ridiculous too ... If I were strapped for cash, I just get everybody liquored up on cheap wine or beer rather than charging for drinks. Your friends decided to go a different way, and they told you well ahead of time about these charges. To ignore the info they gave you, go to the party, and get on your high horse about being charged definitely puts you in OTT YTA territory.", ">  I told him because I think it's ridiculous that they are charging their close friends for drinks. \n\nWhy did you feel the need to say this?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you can't afford the drinks between the 4 of you, why have a party in the first place.", "Because it's ridiculous that they are charging their close friends for drinks...", "3 Square of paper?!?  That's \u00a32 please. .", "Sure a college party where broke kids are really just making their $ back is fine but it's also usually $5 w free refills. \n\nBYOB would have been super easy to do here.  we do that just bc everyone drinks something different but still offer staples like vodka & mixers and do some type of shot", "Yeah. I did the math above. Even at the inflated prices my states ABC store charges, it\u2019s between a 250% and 500% markup over costs.", "Not to mention their homeowners insurance.", "NTA. I would have been super uncomfortable as well. Did it seem like they were making a lot of money based on the prices? Did any of their other guests say anything?", "It\u2019s also even weirder they specifically asked you why you didn\u2019t buy many drinks. Really seems like they were trying to get money out of you since they were tracking how much you drank", "Yep, it's ridiculous and probably illegal. I remember some parties back in my college days when the hosts would charge a cover to come, but that was usually like $5 or $10 per person in exchange for all the hunch punch you could drink, and typically people waived the charge if you were bringing alcohol yourself to contribute. Broke college kids trying to recoup costs is one thing, but these people are in their 40s and trying to charge per drink? Completely insane. OP was very polite by buying one drink and hanging around for a bit, I don't think I'd have done that much.", "It really makes me wonder sometimes.", "And the OP had even asked upfront if they needed to do anything or bring anything. Nope, nothing. (Just your wallet afterwards)", "It's the equivalent of a BYOB situation. If you didn't like it, you didn't have to go. And you sure as heck didn't have to do the, \"I told him I find the fact that they are charging for drinks, and keeping the money for themselves ridiculous and taking advantage of their friends.\" thing at the end. They are not taking advantage of anyone by doing EXACTLY what they said they were going to do. I'm going to give you a similar situation. There had been some friction with an acquaintance of mine. Someone on the outter ring of my circle of friends. She wanted to host a dinner to make it up to everyone. Fine. A week or two before, she wrote to all of us saying she needed everyone to contribute $25 to the cost of the meal. You know what I did? I wrote her back and said I couldn't go. I did NOT show up then start bitching about her charging us for the meal. I just didn't go.", "Well said", "I'm glad you spoke up.", "YTA \n\nLets rewrite this.  You get an invitation to a costume party (it says so on the invitation), you had dressed up in some costume in some minor way (like a funny t-shirt or a hat) and then you leave early and when asked why you were leaving you said \"costume parties are ridiculous\" and insulting/arguing with the hosts about this.\n\nYou took something that was a \"not my cup of tea\"/\"live and learn\" and made it into a thing.", "Sorry I can't spare a square!", "for that price, you're gonna wipe me", "Maybe, but they did not tell outright what would be charged per drink. If they had charged $1-$2 per drink, it would be reasonable, with alcohol going to $3-$4 at most. However, almost $10 is way overpriced for a drink made at home. That is making a huge profit, not \"keeping costs low\".", "Like I said in the post, if it was a proper bar situation with a bar tender they hired and all guests were paying for their drinks ok acceptable. \n\nIf it was a \"all profits go to charity\" situation ok acceptable.\n\nBut it literally was just them making a quick buck off of their guests. We're talking **4 people** here. Not 1 or 2 but **4**.", "This isnt a party they are trying to get money from their friends and clearly it wasnt a party for the hosts you dont call out your friends for not drinking enough. You dont bartend full time at a party you host.", "Nah, OP, you're NTA, this person must charge their close friends for drinks when they host a party.", "> if it was a proper bar situation with a bar tender they hired and all guests were paying for their drinks ok acceptable.\n\n> If it was a \"all profits go to charity\" situation ok acceptable.\n\nYou don't get to say what is acceptable for other people to do or not at their own party.  Its like saying \"Costume parties have colorful balloons.  Its ridiculous to not have colorful balloons at a costume party!\" There was nothing to indicate in the invitation that it was a proper bar or not nor if it went to charity or not.  If it was so important to you then you could had asked before attending."]}
