But your uncle sure is.\n\nSeems to me that he's trying to project the image of a cool, big-shot, generous uncle without actually having to pony up the dough.  Good for you for calling him out.\n\nHaving financial difficulties is no excuse for lying and risking possibly getting you in trouble or embarrassment.  If he really wanted to keep quiet about his financial difficulties, he should have just kept a low profile rather than pulling the stunt he did.", "NTA!\n\nHe's basically saying it's inconvenient for him that you're not responding to his lies that hurt you by helping him lie to you more. You'd have been better to call him out on it directly the first time, or at least the second rather than putting up with it for so long.", "NTA. He lied. Repeatedly. Not saying anything only reinforces that bad behavior. If he didn't have the money he shouldn't have made a big production out of it and just been honest with you. I'm sure you would have been understanding.", "NTA There is nothing unusual about having financial issues, particularly now. But it isn't like everyone getting the gift cards won't have already noticed the discrepancy. (Unless he just did it to you, which is worse) \n\nJust a card with a note saying you wish it could be more would have been better. Empty bragging and expecting others to prop up your ego and cover for your lies is ridiculous and childish.", "NTA...How long did he think you could go on not saying anything? There are so many better ways for him to handle this, but he chose to lie...and brag about it.", "NTA. You put up with it longer than I would have. I would've asked him about it publicly when he handed me the second one.", "NTA.  He didn't need to lie.  He could have just said, \"Congratulations\" and that would have been enough.

He needs to get himself sorted out.", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nHe should take the Costanza route and give out cards saying he has made a donation in your name for $_____ to the Human Fund.  https://y.yarn.co/7a677cbb-64c6-4371-b2a7-b9b211bf833f_text.gif", "Dude, I'm in a ***horrific*** financial position and often have been due to generational poverty, disability, and financial abuse and I can tell you there's no excuse for this nor is there any making this situation better.\n\nHe shouldn't be gifting nonexistent gift cards *period,* not giving them and then approaching the recipient after to tell them their \"gift\" *that he boasted about or otherwise performatively gifted* is useless. That's honestly mean and rude. \n\nIt gets people's hopes up and makes him look like a big generous dude but he's just lying to look good.\n\nThe *appropriate* thing is to gift within his budget or *save* in order to give gifts outside of that. Anyone I'm close enough to gift something to is aware that I'm poor, so if they expect more well... sorry, they're a little delusional and selfish lol. If it's a big life event, chances are, I was able to have months or longer to plan so I could put away like a buck or two a month until I can afford a more substantial gift or I find some other way to add to what they receive from me.\n\nFor stuff like a birthday, I tend to get them something I know they'll be able to use or like or a ~$10-15 gift card somewhere where that could actually purchase something like movie theaters if they like movies or Starbucks or the local instrument shop so they could buy strings/picks or something. Sometimes personal gifts are cheaper, I've purchased glassware for a friend who'd just moved out (cost $10 for an entire set because I looked for deals) or a nice pan for my friend who liked to cook ($12 at TJ Maxx.)\n\nPersonally, I am always overjoyed to receive ANY acknowledgement, but I would be tremendously hurt that someone gifted me a fake gift and expected me to just be fine with that forever, never saying anything about it and then tried to shame me because they were supposedly doing it due to the cost -- ignoring the fact that the REAL problem is him boasting about How Rich And Kind I Am when he's lying through his teeth. I'd rather have nothing! Lol. Like lose the performance and just get me what you're already getting me... nothing.\n\nGiven how understanding and empathetic OP comes across I'd say they would have rather received say a $5 gift card and a nice card (btw Dollar Tree in the US sells nice cards 2/$1 if you're poor) than to have their Uncle pull this crap. They likely would not have even expressed disappointment, as they hadn't when they received $6/$100 on the one card.\n\nIt's just so terrible.", "That's very true, it was annoying and a little embarrassing the first couple of times because I was buying things I probably wouldn't have if I didn't have a gift card to that particular store, so then I spent almost $150 of my own money on stuff I didn't need because I didn't want to go put everything back when the card didn't work.", "I think that's true, he's one of those people who seems to always be spending more money than he could possibly make at his job.", "I haven't heard from any other family members that it happened to them too, but he pulled my name two years in a row for Christmas so he hasn't really gotten any other extended family gifts. He just calls and wishes my dad (his brother) a happy birthday so he hasn't bought him  a gift in a few years.", "We draw names every year for Christmas, he just happened to pull my name two years in a row so I haven't seen him give another person a gift card. I doubt he would get away with giving his kids a blank gift card though.", ">  never saying anything about it\n\nExactly. I've been in this position before. One year I gifted my family gift cards to Dollar Tree as a \"gag\" gift but really I was just broke. But I talked to everyone who got one and told them the real deal and they understood I just wanted to give SOMETHING and they were atleast understanding to my face.", "Exactly, I would have been grateful for just a $5 or $10 gift card to get a coffee or something, but he also put me in a bad spot because I then splurged on some items I didn't need and then ended up paying out of pocket for because the card didn't work. I was in grad school and making little money the first three times it happened and made a point to shop for deals or save to give the person I drew for secret Santa a useful gift for under $25, so it's more of a slap in the face when a grown man with a full time job gives you a fake gift.", "Right? I can\u2019t help thinking, as someone who\u2019s constantly shifting money around in their budget, if I received a 100 dollar gift card, I would put a little more of my own money toward my credit card debt, and try to use the visa gift card for groceries or gas. If this were my uncle, I\u2019d be totally strapped until the next pay period. This behavior is super sh*tty and weird.", "Did he think that you would just never call him out, that you wouldn\u2019t notice, or that you would somehow love getting spent cards?", "Yo, I wouldn't even apologize too much. NGL, I never receive any gifts. Period. All of the people I'm thoughtful for I guess just kinda brush me off or something. I would be thrilled that someone remembered me/cared enough that I had something. And I would use the shit out of a Dollar Tree gift card lol.\n\nIf people cannot have gratitude for a gift because it's not expensive or extravagant enough, then they really don't deserve a gift that IS enough by their standards. They wouldn't have a true appreciation of it. \n\nIt's one thing if someone buys you gifts that are awful because they don't care it's another thing if they're poor or if they TRIED to get you something. It's an entirely different thing if you want people to think you're Hot Shit so you re-gift your nibling a mostly spent $100 gift card, while you go on and on about your status, only to get mad when they don't keep secret how much of a bizarre miserly shit you are. What a world we live in, eh? \n\nIt really is supposed to be the damn thought that counts and too many assholes out here get mad that they're not treated like royalty on a diplomatic visit with every holiday/birthday/milestone: showered in attention, money, parades, parties, and gifts.\n\nShit, I just want people to give back what I put in; energy wise, empathy wise, and gift wise. You can literally spend $3 on a gift and I will still adore it, especially if it's somehow related to something I've mentioned.  You could just get me a card and write something nice and I'm THRILLED.", "I really think he believed I would never say anything or would think it's my fault somehow because I'm very non-confrontational and agreeable. I could believe once that I accidentally demagnatized the card, used it and forgot or the store made a mistake, but four times is a stretch.", "So he thought that you would just take it lying down and is now butt hurt that you proved him wrong."]}
