At very least, he should've told you personally afterwards so you don't look embarrassed in the store.", " NTA He\u2019s ashamed bc his behavior is shameful. Not your problem.", "NTA. If he didn't have the money for it he should have just said so instead of lying and pretending.", "NTA\n\nIf he had financial issues, he can choose not to get you a gift or to get one of much less value. He doesn't have to say why in front of people.\n\nBut using you to appear generous / hide his financial issues in front of others or whatever, nope that's not ok.", "NTA Your uncle is a doodle bug. You didn't do anything wrong, you tried to use a gift card he gave you. All you did was explain what happened to your grandmother who was with you when your tried to use it. His mother called him out for giving out used gift cards.", "Priceless, the cheap bastard who wants to look like a big spender got his comeuppance- obviously you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA.  But your uncle sure is.\n\nSeems to me that he's trying to project the image of a cool, big-shot, generous uncle without actually having to pony up the dough.  Good for you for calling him out.\n\nHaving financial difficulties is no excuse for lying and risking possibly getting you in trouble or embarrassment.  If he really wanted to keep quiet about his financial difficulties, he should have just kept a low profile rather than pulling the stunt he did.", "NTA!\n\nHe's basically saying it's inconvenient for him that you're not responding to his lies that hurt you by helping him lie to you more. You'd have been better to call him out on it directly the first time, or at least the second rather than putting up with it for so long.", "NTA. He lied. Repeatedly. Not saying anything only reinforces that bad behavior. If he didn't have the money he shouldn't have made a big production out of it and just been honest with you. I'm sure you would have been understanding.", "NTA There is nothing unusual about having financial issues, particularly now. But it isn't like everyone getting the gift cards won't have already noticed the discrepancy. (Unless he just did it to you, which is worse) \n\nJust a card with a note saying you wish it could be more would have been better. Empty bragging and expecting others to prop up your ego and cover for your lies is ridiculous and childish.", "NTA...How long did he think you could go on not saying anything? There are so many better ways for him to handle this, but he chose to lie...and brag about it.", "NTA. You put up with it longer than I would have. I would've asked him about it publicly when he handed me the second one.", "NTA.  He didn't need to lie.  He could have just said, \"Congratulations\" and that would have been enough.  Actions, meet consequences.  Just makes me wonder what ELSE he's lying about.  Because I guarangoddamntee you this is the tip of the iceberg.", "You can get away with something like that ONCE or MAYBE TWICE but to try multiple times with the same person is just dumb", "NTA. If you're having financial trouble and don't want people to know maybe don't \"announce that he had been doing well at work and wanted to be generous.\"", "No, you're not the asshole. In fact, you've been patient as heck.", "NTA. You didn't even call him out. His mother did.", "NTA. He tried being a big shot and got called out for his bs. It wouldn\u2019t even be an issue if he didn\u2019t make a big deal about it and try flexing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Once is an accident. FOUR times is a strategy. He likes looking like the big man giving big gifts, but he's actually a cheap miser. He has only himself to blame. If he was having financial issues, he could have given smaller gifts or even no gifts, but the deliberate bait-and-switch is cruel."]}
