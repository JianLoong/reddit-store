That's honestly mean and rude. \n\nIt gets people's hopes up and makes him look like a big generous dude but he's just lying to look good.\n\nThe *appropriate* thing is to gift within his budget or *save* in order to give gifts outside of that. Anyone I'm close enough to gift something to is aware that I'm poor, so if they expect more well... sorry, they're a little delusional and selfish lol. If it's a big life event, chances are, I was able to have months or longer to plan so I could put away like a buck or two a month until I can afford a more substantial gift or I find some other way to add to what they receive from me.\n\nFor stuff like a birthday, I tend to get them something I know they'll be able to use or like or a ~$10-15 gift card somewhere where that could actually purchase something like movie theaters if they like movies or Starbucks or the local instrument shop so they could buy strings/picks or something. Sometimes personal gifts are cheaper, I've purchased glassware for a friend who'd just moved out (cost $10 for an entire set because I looked for deals) or a nice pan for my friend who liked to cook ($12 at TJ Maxx.)\n\nPersonally, I am always overjoyed to receive ANY acknowledgement, but I would be tremendously hurt that someone gifted me a fake gift and expected me to just be fine with that forever, never saying anything about it and then tried to shame me because they were supposedly doing it due to the cost -- ignoring the fact that the REAL problem is him boasting about How Rich And Kind I Am when he's lying through his teeth. I'd rather have nothing! Lol.

I doubt he would get away with giving his kids a blank gift card though.", ">  never saying anything about it\n\nExactly. I've been in this position before.

I was in grad school and making little money the first three times it happened and made a point to shop for deals or save to give the person I drew for secret Santa a useful gift for under $25, so it's more of a slap in the face when a grown man with a full time job gives you a fake gift.", "Right? I can\u2019t help thinking, as someone who\u2019s constantly shifting money around in their budget, if I received a 100 dollar gift card, I would put a little more of my own money toward my credit card debt, and try to use the visa gift card for groceries or gas. If this were my uncle, I\u2019d be totally strapped until the next pay period.

I would be thrilled that someone remembered me/cared enough that I had something. And I would use the shit out of a Dollar Tree gift card lol.\n\nIf people cannot have gratitude for a gift because it's not expensive or extravagant enough, then they really don't deserve a gift that IS enough by their standards. They wouldn't have a true appreciation of it. \n\nIt's one thing if someone buys you gifts that are awful because they don't care it's another thing if they're poor or if they TRIED to get you something. It's an entirely different thing if you want people to think you're Hot Shit so you re-gift your nibling a mostly spent $100 gift card, while you go on and on about your status, only to get mad when they don't keep secret how much of a bizarre miserly shit you are. What a world we live in, eh? \n\nIt really is supposed to be the damn thought that counts and too many assholes out here get mad that they're not treated like royalty on a diplomatic visit with every holiday/birthday/milestone: showered in attention, money, parades, parties, and gifts.\n\nShit, I just want people to give back what I put in; energy wise, empathy wise, and gift wise. You can literally spend $3 on a gift and I will still adore it, especially if it's somehow related to something I've mentioned.  You could just get me a card and write something nice and I'm THRILLED.", "I really think he believed I would never say anything or would think it's my fault somehow because I'm very non-confrontational and agreeable. I could believe once that I accidentally demagnatized the card, used it and forgot or the store made a mistake, but four times is a stretch.", "So he thought that you would just take it lying down and is now butt hurt that you proved him wrong.", "NTA. A friend of mine did this to me with a Starbucks gift card one Christmas. She gave me a card for $25. I was so happy because I was flat broke and I could eat Starbucks sandwiches for days to tie me over. It had $5.67 on it. It was enough to get me 1 sandwich and a cookie. This was in 2010.

I just slowly stepped away from her over the years.", "He was having financial problems so he decided to give fake gift certificates to everyone ? Lol", "NTA. Your uncle is a tool. If he is having financial difficulties, he could have given you something else instead of calling attention to himself by bragging about being generous. He could have spoken to you in private or made you a gift or found something on sale or any number of other things. Instead, he decided to showboat and pretend to be someone he is not. He sounds like one of those Instagram fools that pretends to be wealthy when they are not. You did right to call him out. He's probably doing this to other people too. Or he plans too.

I know it's embarrassing, but if you have to essentially pay for it yourself and you can't afford it, then people shouldn't judge (and to hell with them if they do, it's not your fault!) Better than unexpectedly buying yourself a \"treat\" that you can't afford and will feel like shit about.\n\nTo me, at best, he's pathetic to pander to family like they're an audience, to manipulate you into believing you had a nice gift instead of getting gifts in his price range or actually getting you a nice gift, disappointing and humiliating you when you took it at literal face value but then couldn't purchase anything except by dipping into YOUR OWN MONEY -- money you couldn't really spend on that, and then the extra added bullshit of expecting you to stay silent, to never mention it EVEN WHEN HE JUST GETS MORE BRAZEN and does it every time. \n\nFrom now on, I wouldn't even accept a gift from this ass nor would I ever gift him a damn thing.

Or sometimes the card isn't even activated? WTF??\n\n\nA cashier's error I can understand. But this looks like that is not this case.", "When you got the visa gift card, you should have called and checked the balance right then and there on speakerphone.\n\nNta", "NTA should have handed it back to him and said you don't need whatever he has left on his old giftcards.", "NTA. It\u2019s fine to have financial issues, but dont go around giving Scott\u2019s Tots approved gifts. No gift is better than a fake gift. He could make something. He could offer personal coupons to help you out in some way. Or, well, nothing. Instead he\u2019s giving you false excitement and the gift of letting him stroke his own ego.", "NTA you tell him out of you and him - HE is the asshole. And that hes been doing this TO you and making you feel like shit on every celebratory day you have and praising himself in fromt of the family. That he cant lie and pretend he is something hes not. He is jot a doting well off uncle and the family WILL KNOW if he keeps this up.", "NTA. I'd much rather get no gift than a used or never activated giftcard. That just seems insulting to get you excited then waste your time and leave you irritated and embarrassed when it doesn't work.  That is just a dick move. If he is having financial problems that's fine as it happens and can often be no fault of your own, but to brag about being generous when you are anything but is asking for trouble.", "NTA.", "Not the AH", "NTA.", "A $5 Starbucks would have been just fine. Or nothing. What a jerk he is.", "I have an older brother who is significantly older than me. Like he moved out before I started kindergarten.\n\nHe lived several states away, so we didn't see him often, but every year, birthdays & Christmas, he would tell me he got me something special and was mailing it out to me. I waited by that mailbox for weeks, each time. Until I just stopped believing him.\n\nWe joke about it now, but in the past, he's said, \"I didn't want you to think I forgot about you. And I just didn't have the money to get you what I wanted to.\"\n\nYou are NTA for relying on expectations someone else laid down.", "NTA. You did try to take the high road. Uncle ignored it and had the audacity to brag about how generous he was. He gambled on your being non-confrontational and lost. Good for you.", "NTA. He's putting you in a position of rocking up to a cashier with \u00a3100 of stuff and being told your card carries like \u00a33, so you've either got to look an idiot and say you can't afford it, or buy it all out of your own pocket?! That's a crappy stunt to pull.", "*He later texted me and said I was wrong for calling him out* \n\nNope.  He gave you a lie as a fake gift.  **He's the one who did wrong here**, not you.  **He deserved to be caught** at it.\n\n*in front of his mother* \n\nWell, that was simply brilliant of you, to have a witness.\n\n*and that he had been having financial issues he wanted to keep quiet.* \n\nNot your problem.  You have no obligation to lie for him.  How about all the disappointment that you had, because of his lies?  **The obligation here is his, to you**. He repeatedly lied to you. He repeatedly gave you a fake gift.  He repeatedly made you unhappy, while having to pretend to be happy receiving his fake gifts.  His finances are his issue, not yours.  If he wanted to keep his financial troubles secret, maybe he could have not lied, and just given you a nice card instead of making up those bragging lies and making it all worse for himself.   **He's done layers of lies here.**\n\n*I responded by saying I gave him the chance to fess up the time before about the email gift card but he wouldn't answer,* \n\nYou are right.\n\n*and that if he was having financial issues he shouldn't have bragged about going OVER the prescribed gift amount and just actually spent $25.*\n\nAgain, you are right.  Or just not given a gift at all, if he can't afford it.  It's the bragging, and the layers of lies, that show him for the AH he is.\r  \n\r  \n*AITA?*\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You handled this awesomely. He earned what little embarrassment it caused him. You didn\u2019t out him in front of the entire family or friends, so he should thank you. He should also apologize for being such a showy jackass\u2026 he tried to make himself look cool all at your expense. Congrats for keeping it close to the vest!", "NTA.  Should have called his lying ass out WAY sooner.", "NTA.  I think the way you handled it was appropriate.  Tell him that you'd rather received a card with nothing in it that guess what's left on these gift cards.", "You are entitled to tell your grandmother anything directly related to you. Like repetitively being given used up or possibly stolen gift cards. \n\nIf your uncle wanted to keep his financial troubles quiet, then he shouldn\u2019t have given you used gift cards. He should have just given flowers, or made something, or just told you straight up he\u2019s struggling. He chose essentially fraud instead. \n\nYour uncle has a problem. Lots of people go through hard times. This kind of behavior isn\u2019t normal. \n\nNow, that said, a lot of men have a block about admitting when they\u2019re in financial or emotional trouble. Society looks upon it as a weakness. They are supposed to soldier on\u2026until they can\u2019t.

Not giving a gift at all.", "NTA", "NTA and you handles this brilliantly.", "NTA", "\"I can't afford a gift\" is so much less cringe and weird than \"I got you a fake gift to save face, pls pretend to be happy\"", "\u2018I wanted to keep it quiet\u2019. Then don\u2019t go bragging about being super generous then?", "He tried.  He emailed his uncle and his uncle never replied.", "If he ever gives you another gift card, throw it away in front of him", "Just curious - do you know if he does this to anyone else? Like, clearly his grandmother was shocked. This is wild. I'm glad you exposed him.\n\nEdit: sorry, just realized you already answered that you do not know of it happening to anyone else in another comment.", "I've given adults lottery scratchers. Don't cost a lot and they have a chance of getting lucky.", "FWIW I would\u2019ve been stoked to get a dollar tree gift card. I enjoy their affordable snack variety.", "I once found an old gift card so i checked the funds on it cuz i wasn't sure and apparently, i hadn't used the thing at all in the year that i had it. I was very happy. It's always wise to check before spending", "If youre comfortable to PM a mailing address I will send you a card! I work in an office and write letters and stuff with the supplies all day between my calls. I\u2019d be more than happy to! No pressure though", "I feel like I would rather have the flu than have that awful moment of coming up short at the cash register.", "NTA better to give a small gift than to lie about it. How sleazy.", "That is so weird", "NTA and I admire your power move. Nicely done!", "NTA plain and simple", "NTA. People will understand if someone is struggling financially and can't give a lavish gift... But don't lie and say you're giving one.", "He got caught in his web. Good thing one wonder how many family members he scammed.", "NTA He is bragging and making a big show of giving something worth nothing.", "NTA, he could have placed you in legal trouble.  What if you had gone out to eat or any other service and counted on this to cover your bill.  You would be the one they called the cops one.", "I was in dollar general and the girl in front of me had a baby and a cart full of survival groceries. She was trying to pay with a $50 Amazon card that she won in an Xmas grab bag. I was just getting milk so I only brought $5. She was crying and the whole thing was really sad. I always take my wallet now", "Sort of both. In my family, if something like that were to happen, we would just call the other and say \u201chey what the fuck is this man? Could\u2019ve given me nothing except your presence at the party and I would\u2019ve been thankful but instead I went to use it and it was empty and I had to pay for my shit and embarrass myself in line\u201d with that being said, it would\u2019ve been easier for you to confront him directly instead of telling your grandma. It also would\u2019ve been better for him to tell you the cards were empty and play it off as a joke or something like that.", "I say give him a gift card not activated for next event in the family. Tell him it\u2019s as good as the ones he gave you.", "NTA what an AH to let you try to shop with a supposed $100 gift card $50 gift card when it had $3 or nothing on it. All so he could appear to be generous. He needs to grow up.", "NTA\n\nIn fact he is a major one for repeatedly putting you in these positions where you are at a register without the expected funds to pay for your item.", "[removed]", "NTA but my hero! We\u2019ll played.", "NTA.\n\nA lot of ppl are in financial issues. But there is no need to pretend one is well-off and pretentiously giving expensive gifts. What's the point in that?

Lol, tell him your sorry he's embarrassed, but now that the air is \"cleared\" so to speak, you two can start fresh with a nice hug and a card during gift giving season and that you appreciate the sentiment.", "NTA.\nNow that your Grandma knows, the whole family gonna know! \ud83d\ude01", "Lol good on you NTA. \n\nMy uncle forgot to get me a gift one year and give the detachable hood off of one of his sons coats", "You are so NTA.  Your grandma was totally right to lay into him for being so obnoxious.  How long did he expect to get away with this crap, I wonder?  \n\n\nIf he whines any more, just say what you said here:  Grandma wanted to go with you to the store to spend your gift, and SHE saw what happened with her own eyes.  You aren't to blame for him being a liar.", "NTA what a sleezeball move.", "NTA. You maybe should've been more direct with her instead of pretending you thought there was money on the card, but tbh it doesn't even matter and that's the only part I can nitpick.   \n\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong here. He did.", "NTA", "Tell him you're giving him a car and make it a Hot Wheels.", "NTA, your uncle sounds like a narcissist who underestimated you. Narcissists absolutely detest being called out in their bee ehss (especially in front of witnesses) and he acted very predictably responding with bypassing any responsibility or acknowledging of your feelings and shifting the blame onto you.
