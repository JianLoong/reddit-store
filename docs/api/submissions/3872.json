He sounds like a total A tbh.", "NTA - actions have consequences.  When your brother chose to disown all of you, he also chose the consequences of not having his disowned family pay his bill.\n\nHe is using the disowning to get you all to do what he wants.  That\u2019s not how an adult behaves.  If any of you cave, he will use the disowning again, to get what he wants.\n\nActions have consequences.", "NTA. Stonewalling your brother's weakass manipulation tactics is exactly the way to go. He's trying to guilt-trip you while playing the weakest hand he could possibly have. Laugh and leave him to it.", "Nta-he disowned you and your dad, that cuts both ways, and him saying he\u2019ll think about undisowning you if you pay his bill is BS", "What? Come on. Emotionally blackmailing the own family is disgusting. NTA of course.", "NTA if you pay he'll think about undisowning you? lmfao tell him to get fucked. He disowned his family it's up to him to figure his shit out.", "NTA. Your brother is an AH and he is clearly using this a manipulative control tactic. He needs help but not if the money kind. He made his decision to disown y\u2019all\u2026 show him what those words mean. Let him figure it out. Let him be the adult and apply for financial aid through the hospital. Tough love is best sometimes. I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s been in an accident and is in this spot\u2026 however clearly he is demanding y\u2019all give up your lives for him\u2026 that\u2019s not fair.", "NTA.", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t have a right to your money", "NTA at all. Your brother plays games. As the old saying goes, Play stupid games win stupid prizes.

He's 19 so legally an adult, who is responsible for his own bills.\n\n1. To \"disown\" someone you must have some means, either financial or material (like in real estate, or expensive jewelry or such) and then withold that from someone. In short, they're not getting that. From what I understand your brother has not much so he can't do that. So that threat is baseless. He *could* stop talking to you all though, and I think that that's his threat.\n2. The threat (for which I think your dad at least isn't falling) is \"If you don't pay up, I'll stop talking to you all\".\n\nBlock his phone number for a while, don't pay his bills.

You owe him nothing. Your a dad owes him nothing. He is an adult and should be taking care of his own bills since he thinks it\u2019s ok to disown family just because they didn\u2019t come to the hospital every day. He made his choice by throwing a tantrum when you and your dad tried but ultimately have your own lives to live as well.", "NTA but according to him he isn't your brother, and you aren't his family so...", "Is undisowning even a thing?

Was it therapy in the sense if counselling or was \u00e0 psychiatrist involved ?", "If you guys pay that bill he will pull this disowning thing every time he want something from you guys. Say no. NTA.", "Lol.  Yeah, that's a big no.  First of all, if you're in the US (I don't know about other countries) he'll be in a much better position to get the hospital costs reduced (being 19, presumably unemployed with no assets) than you or your parents family.   And if he doesn't, it only affects his credit, not yours.  In fact the law just changed so medical debt isn't used to calculate credit.  Again, this is the US only but might be similar elsewhere.  \n\nBeyond that, he's insufferable right now and needs to know that you won't keep putting up with it for the great prize of \"being undisowned\".   Tell him you love him and wish him a speedy recovery.   NTA", "NTA. Brother needs to learn you don't buy love or respect. Walk away and don't feel bad.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.  First, demanding the payment of a hospital bill in order to be undisowned is extortion.  Second, if he cannot afford to pay his bill outright he can contact the hospital's billing office and let them know what he can afford on a monthly basis until his balance has been paid.  Third, it sounds like he is extremely comfortable with others picking up his tab.  He might actually (later down the road) thank you for NOT bailing him out.  He will learn responsibility and start accruing respect when he starts acting like an adult.  My son had to learn this the hard way as well.  He sorely needed the lesson and is on a more productive path.  Remember, the greatest gift you can give is teaching self-reliance for the day those older than him have passed on.\n\nI would reccomend keeping an open mind and heart even though it may be difficult.  He IS quite young.  He has not yet discovered himself yet and you can help him on that journey.  As trying as that may be.  It does not mean you have to be a pushover or a bank.", "Exactly.
