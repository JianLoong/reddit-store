He\u2019s been with his fianc\u00e9e (DIL) since they were 20 and he wants to marry her.\n\nI\u2019d always liked her before now, she\u2019s a smart girl, she fits in well with the family, she\u2019s driven, and she makes my son happy. Everything was all roses until they got engaged.\n\nNow since I was little I was fascinated with jewellery. When I was older and married and had my own income I started to collect rings.\n\nI would \u201cdesign\u201d them myself, used to ask friends and family to give me cash I could put towards them, and save up my disposable income towards whatever ring I wanted.\n\n*Edit 2: Okay apparently this above paragraph is controversial. It is the custom of my family since always to give cash in celebrations. It\u2019s also very normal in my community to ask your friends to give cash - I have done this myself for my friends.*\n\n*HOWEVER THE MAJORITY OF THE COST OF EACH PIECE OF JEWELLERY WAS ALWAYS BORNE BY ME. Whatever I got from birthdays was a bonus top up - not something I relied on to be able to afford it.*\n\nIt would be less than 10% of each piece definitely not the bulk. 10% being the highest but mostly it was around the 3-4% mark if any.\n\n*Sorry but quite a few comments are being derailed by this*\n\nI wasn\u2019t buying one every year but over time I have a nice collection of rings. My favourite are a sapphire with a halo of diamonds, an emerald in a trilogy with 1ct diamonds either side, and a Ruby set in a pav\u00e9 band.\n\nAfter son got engaged and we invited him and DIL to dinner at home, DIL asked to speak to me. She said she\u2019s been seeing my emerald ring over the years and she has always wanted one.\n\nShe pointed out that I wear it least often, which is true, and demanded that I gift it to her as an heirloom engagement ring. This is in addition to other wedding gifts and expenses we had discussed as a family during dinner. This includes gold to the value of approximately \u00a36000 which is honestly more than my entire wedding cost, and which I still think is a significant amount.\n\nThis rubbed me the wrong way and I admit I accused her of trying to pick through my estate before I\u2019m even dead. I told her the ring is mine and I can even sell it on my deathbed if I want to; she has no right to expect it and she\u2019s being a rude brat by demanding it.\n\nShe yelled at me that something like this can\u2019t just be sold, it should be an heirloom and it\u2019s normal for heirlooms to\nBe passed on while the wearer is still alive.\n\nI told her to leave if she was just in my home to demand my property and she stormed out, taking my son with her.\n\nShe\u2019s mad at me and son says I should\u2019ve just passed the ring to her since I have others and it would\nBe a nice gesture to welcome her to the family! He says it\u2019s no different than his sister occasionally borrowing some of my pieces.\n\nMy husband and my daughter are on my side but this is the first time my son has shut me out like this so AITA?\n\n(Edit: DIL has an engagement ring already. It\u2019s beautiful and I would call it expensive. This is not a case of her being proposed to without a ring.)", "created_utc": 1702419209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gy5rr/aita_for_not_passing_on_an_heirloom_to_my/", "score": 1824, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she wanted it for an engagement ring, the proper thing would have been for your son to discuss it with you.  Her asking for it is shocking and rude.\n\nIt's not an heirloom if you are the first owner in the family.  Heirlooms tend to have generations behind them.  And they are not necessarily given away during the owner's lifetime.  Many family mementos are distributed as part of an estate after the owner is deceased.\n\nDon't loan anything to her or you will never see it again.", "This ring is NOT an heirloom because it was never passed down through generations. It\u2019s just a personal piece with no intention of being passed down. This is not the same as people \u201cborrowing\u201d jewelry, because those are eventually returned.

Kinda insulting.\nLike trying someone else wedding dress before that person got married offensive. \n\nD. Asking to start a tradition is not wrong, can even be a nice bonding experience, demanding that someone gift a pricey  personal jewelry piece to do so just seems greedy.\n\nE.

If she wanted the ring, she should have spoken to your son about it and he should\u2019ve come to you privately to ask if he could use it for her engagement ring. You still would\u2019ve been under no obligation to give it her and it still would be a little weird that she\u2019s just asking for one of your possessions, but that at least would\u2019ve been a reasonable way to handle it. \n\nYour future DIL sounds a little crazy and they are still very young to be getting married. Good luck with her in the future, I have a feeling you\u2019ll need it.", "NTA\n\nThe ring isn't an heirloom, it's your personal property.

Now OP knows that the fianc\u00e9 is coveting that piece of her jewelry, make sure it\u2019s safe and far from her. I\u2019d go so far as to make sure now that all your jewelry currently has a designated end (will it, sell , etc) so that she never gets her greedy hands on it. \n\nThe only thing I might- might, really depends on how much you actually like your son- is have a nice ring made in the same style for her.

You have a biological daughter, and if anything, she would get it and only if you felt so inclined, would you leave pieces to a DIL or any grandchildren that may be born.  She sounds entitle, greedy and selfish to be out over your own biological daughter. Picking through someone\u2019s belongings and demanding them is gross behavior.", "NTA. I would have understood if you son asked you about a family engagement ring\u2026 your son. Not her. But she had no right to put you on the spot like that.

One is borrowing the other is trying to get their grubby little hands on it forever. Yes, there is a difference. His wife didn't say can I wear this for my wedding day. I would never have the audacity to be tell someone they haven't been wearing a piece of jewelry much lately and therefore should just go ahead and gift it to me. WTF?\n\nI would like to add (I know it's a long way off but) I would make sure you list all your pieces in the will and who they go to, because she's already shown you she thinks she's entitled to them and she will go after what she wants.", "How was your 22 year old son able to afford a one carat diamond  ring?

That request is tacky AF.", "NTA. I am sure you would have let your future DIL borrow the ring if asked, but to basically say she wants it so give it to her now is beyond rude. I borrowed my mother's items over the years with no expectations of keeping or receiving them. And for her to assume she had first pick over your daughter is really entitled. Your son is under her thumb.", "I think it was your son's place to ask you when she wasn't around. She just made herself look like a gold digger", "NTA - the entitlement from her and your son is incredible.  To even ask for it would have been rude, but to demand it?  Wow.", "NTA. If you (on your own) had come up with the idea to gift a ring for your son to use as for engagement and chose that ring and offered it to YOUR SON to use and he accepted- that would all be fine and sweet. However, having your son and FDIL over for dinner to acknowledge/celebrate the engagement does not equal an invitation to ask for your stuff. The audacity is glaringly horrifying. Just the fact that she came to you like that and your son\u2019s response to her rudeness was to just give it to her is a huge clue of family fun to come. Do not give her anything because I suspect this woman isn\u2019t going to make your life easy or pleasant. I would be furious for the next several decades if I had to see my emerald in her stupid finger!", "NTA. While I don't think asking for a ring is a problem, becoming enraged at hearing 'no' definitely is. You don't owe her anything. You do owe it to yourself to keep your jewelry in a safe, because she's probably going to try to help herself to something, the first chance she gets.", "NTA it is not normal for heirlooms to be passed while the person is still alive. Your future DIL sounds greedy. Let her know you bought your own jewelry, she is welcome to work hard and buy her own collection as well.", "NTA it\u2019s your ring to do with as you wish. Prenup is the word your son needs to learn before marrying her. Her behavior was odd and very rude. If you don\u2019t have your jewelry and watches locked up you better get a safe. If you have a safe I\u2019d change the code.", "NTA, but this is another case of a situation getting heated unnecessarily. \u201cHey, I like your ring, can I have it as an heirloom?\u201d, \u201coh I\u2019m glad you like it, I like it too, as I designed it myself. It\u2019s one of my top 3. At this point I don\u2019t want to part with it but as I know you appreciate it so much, maybe I\u2019ll consider it in my will.\u201d Basically a thanks but no thanks without the name calling and yelling. \n\nAlso, I have an affinity for rings too, but not the disposable income for it yet. I have my sapphire engagement ring and my grandmother\u2019s emerald ring set. I\u2019ve been on the search for a ruby ring to complete the three like you have.", "Man, I love the idea of heirloom engagement rings, but it has to be the families idea!  You can\u2019t just show up and demand they start a tradition by demanding someone\u2019s jewelry!  She is so entitled.  I hope your son sees this as a red flag and seriously considers his options.", "NTA. Wow! The entitlement is extreme! I can't imagine asking for a personal piece of jewelry that's clearly worth significant money! Also--it's not an heirloom yet. It's a ring YOU had made. You could absolutely sell it from your deathbed. It's only an heirloom if you decide to pass it down. Don't lend her anything--she thinks your things are already hers.", "NTA, it was outrageous of her to even ask.", "NTA\n\nShe is very entitled to even ask, just wow!!", "NTA - in my experience, heirloom jewelry is typically passed to daughters so that it isn\u2019t at risk of leaving the family through divorce.", "NTA. It isn't an heirloom until you pass it down, which you clearly aren't planning to do any time soon. \n\nI suggest that you pick one ring that you will pass down to her, and have the stone replaced with a replica that is utter junk.

How does she know that you weren\u2019t already planning to give it to her? \n\nSecond of all, I think it\u2019s rude that she even asked in the first place. Your son\u2019s comparison to your daughter borrowing pieces is apples to oranges. She\u2019s borrowing pieces and returning them, not taking them.", "NTA! It was not her place to ask, your son should have asked, and you have no obligation to say yes.", "NTA that's really weird, idk why she thought that would go well lol", "NTA\n\nHer asking was fine. The pushback when you said no is not. Personally, I'd do what I could to be the mature party and de-escalate the situation because she's a very young woman and you liked her before this. Also, she's marrying your son, and you don't want a fight. Calm clear boundaries. Less statements about your rights.", "Wow. This can\u2019t be true. NTA.", "Nta... if she says you don't wear this ring often that means she's watching you. That is just creepy behaviour.  I'd stay the heck away from her.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nHoly crap she has a lot of nerve to not only ask for your precious jewellery but then get angry at you for saying no. Unbelievable. I would never ever expect my MIL to gift me her jewelry. Just because some families will offer it, it should never be expected. Tacky and classless on her part.", "Petty me would wear it at their wedding. Keep a close eye on her, she is showing you some really bad traits. I would even go so far as to put in your will who you want the rings to go to such as your daughter.

I would think it was bad even if she\u2019d just hinted at getting it when you kick the bucket.  Like has she not noticed you\u2019re still actively living your life?", "NTA\n\nIt may have escalated, but your concerns are valid. I've read your comments about your freedom to do whatever you wish with your jewelry being the point and I agree with you. She has a very warped definition of heirlooms. They're usually filled with generations of history that are passed on after the owner dies or they're close to dying. So, yeah, she's being greedy. She's happy to marry into a family where her MIL has beautiful authentic jewelry. She went too far imo. *Especially* since her fiance took the time to design a beautiful ring with her in mind!!! If she was eyeing your rings (which obviously she was), she should have approached that with your son instead of letting him buy and design the ring she was given. It's just so entitled and rude!", "NTA. Do not keep your rings in your home where she can get to them. They will disappear.", "NTA. It\u2019s yours to do with as you please. I honestly can\u2019t imagine asking someone for their belongings like that. The only case where I think it would be okay is if your son asked for a ring to give her/have it become an heirloom. And you wouldn\u2019t be an AH for saying no to that either. You don\u2019t just ask for an heirloom. And tell your son that borrowing and taking aren\u2019t the same.", "NTA, your DIL is. Her asking was incredibly rude & inappropriate. It doesn't matter that you wear it the least often. The stones that you mentioned are different colors. You wear them when the occasion & your mood fits.\n\nEdited to add: you're 48. Why would someone expect an heirloom from a healthy 48yr old? She sounds like a nightmare. I hope you remember her in your will & specify that she's to get nothing or maybe a ring made from a piece of thread.", "NTA. You should go to their place and start picking out items. Tell them that accidents and unexpected illnesses happen, and they could go at any time, so you are just picking out the items you want in the event said event happens. Or you tell them that you thought you knew the DIL until now and no longer trust her not to steal from you, and shes no longer welcome in your home because she might be a clepto. Who the eff walks into someone house and starts asking them for their stuff? What a whack-a-doodle.", "NTA. And hide your jewelry. She's very crude. You don't ask someone for their things. I don't want you to come home one day and find something missing. Entitled people don't accept NO. Get a safe, or safe deposit box, etc. But secure your jewelry now.", "NTA. OMG who does she think she is? That\u2019s incredibly crass. In crazy rich asians, Rachel admired her future MIL\u2019s emerald ring but never demanded it. Your son better watch out. I\u2019d make sure any jewelry you may wish to pass on goes to your daughter(s) only.", "Hopefully this is one of those behaviours you do at 22, that you later look back on with huge shame and humiliation. At the very least, as soon as your son and his fianc\u00e9 have to explain to other family members why they are estranged from you, even if they tell a very biased version of events, the \"are you serious\" reactions may make them pause. NTA", "Whoa. NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should have called her a rude brat. But I can see how you were probably shocked and reacted in the moment.\n\nShe was acting entitled and presumptuous. The ring isn\u2019t an heirloom if you\u2019re the original owner. And she isn\u2019t entitled to an expensive \u201cgift.\u201d (Not to mention that it\u2019s not much of a \u201cgift\u201d if she\u2019s demanding it.) Also - not for nothing - a lot of times, jewelry is often passed down from mothers to daughters (not daughters-in-law) in order to make sure the jewelry stays in the family in case of any divorce. I assume my mother-in-law will pass her jewelry down to my sister-in-law (her daughter) rather than to me; while my marriage to her son is completely solid, I\u2019d be shocked if she didn\u2019t want it to stay in her nuclear family and then be passed down to her granddaughter (my niece; I don\u2019t have a daughter). But that wouldn\u2019t happen until she\u2019s no longer with us anyway; why on earth would any of us ask her to stop wearing and enjoying her own jewelry just because any of us likes it? How selfish would that be? Especially if *I,* the daughter-in-law, did that? It\u2019s inappropriate to the point of farce.\n\nI\u2019d chalk this all up to immaturity - DIL and your son are young - but the yelling at you and storming out and continuing to be mad at you\u2026 they need to get a grip. If they\u2019re getting married, it\u2019s time to grow up. If they want jewelry like yours, they can save up like you did. They don\u2019t get to demand other people\u2019s belongings.\n\n(If my husband asked his mom if there were something of hers they could give me, then maybe that would be less weird, but they could figure it out between them. But for me to ask my MIL for a specific, expensive piece of hers that she currently wears - even occasionally - and enjoys\u2026 that\u2019s just odd.)", "NTA at all. I can't imagine having the liver to ask for this ring directly. \n\nAnd what makes it worse to me is that you mention having a daughter. Surely if you were going to make this ring an \"heirloom\" you would give it to your daughter (or maybe that's just me).", "The audacity. I wouldn\u2019t give her a thing. Imagine thinking that you can go into someone\u2019s home & ask them to give you their jewelry.  I hope that your jewelry is on a safe deposit box. I wouldn\u2019t trust her to be in my home.", "Your jewelry goes to your daughter! Not someone that could divorce your son! Maybe if she had his daughter, it may be okay.\n\nAsking outright for your valuables is not right!\n\nNta!", "When I was little, both of  my grandmothers let me play dress up with their jewelry when I went to visit them. It stuck with me, so I've been collecting and designing jewelry since I was very young, too.\n\nSo I think I understand how it would feel to have someone waltz in and try to tell me that I should give some of my pieces away. I'd be absolutely flabbergasted and fairly offended. \n\nWhen you design or even just curate a collection, it has meaning to you. The sheer audacity and entitlement of your son and future DIL is ridiculous. \n\nNot to mention the absolute lack of tact. It would be one thing to casually compliment a piece or mention that you've always wanted something similar. It's another entirely, to demand to own someone else's treasured belongings. \n\nPlease protect your beautiful collection from scavengers the next time she's in your home. Please also consider including them as a rider on your insurance if you haven't previously. And then, as morbid as it sounds, you need to amend your will to specify exactly who each piece should go to. \n\nNTA\n\nBut watch that girl. She's just shown you who she really is.", "Nta thats soooooo weird, do not give her a damn thing. It\u2019s disrespectful that she asked.

Your reaction was definitely overboard. I get why you took it as her looting you, but it\u2019s not always the case.

It is not unheard of for a ring owned by a family member to be gifted as an heirloom, and often for a wedding or engagement there are expensive gifts given. Perhaps their mistake was in having her ask you instead of your son asking. Your immediate, over the top, negative reaction, assuming every worst thing about her would be a huge red flag to me if I was her.

It's something I prize to this day. Granted I didn't ask for a bracelet to borrow or to keep it but it was a special moment for us. You handled this so aggressively for no reason.

My favourite are a sapphire with a halo of diamonds, an emerald in a trilogy with 1ct diamonds either side, and a Ruby set in a pav\u00e9 band.\n\nAfter son got engaged and we invited him and DIL to dinner at home, DIL asked to speak to me. She said she\u2019s been seeing my emerald ring over the years and she has always wanted one.\n\nShe pointed out that I wear it least often, which is true, and asked me to gift it to her as an heirloom engagement ring.\n\nThis rubbed me the wrong way and I admit I accused her of trying to pick through my estate before I\u2019m even dead.

I\u2019d also be dialing back on the amount of money you will spend on the wedding and other expenses. \n\nI\u2019m Indian too and I understand the customs surrounding weddings including gifting jewellery etc. Your future daughter in law\u2019s demand is outrageous.", "I think you are def fine to refuse the approach, but it does seem to me like you took A LOT of offense at something that was rude, but could have easily been brushed off. \n\nYou've said a few times that you feel she was trying to go through your estate before you've even remotely thought about it, because you're still young. I wouldn't have assumed that was her intention, especially as she asked for one thing that you say you rarely wear. I think she just wanted the ring, and tried to pose it in a \"sentimental\" way. It was tacky and wrong. But I think your accusations back at her also weren't ideal and there is a whole lot of drama now that probably could have easily been avoided. \n\nThis woman is in your life now, hopefully forever, so maybe just show her some grace and take the high road and forgive her. You of course don't have to give her your possessions, but you can tell her that if you ever plan to sell it, you'll give your son the option to buy it for her first (or you'll give her the opportunity to buy it herself, whichever would go over better). Or just say there was a misunderstanding and you have no intentions of giving away any of your jewelry anytime soon. But let it die.\n\nETA: NTA", "My stepdad went looking for my mom\u2019s jewelry after she died. His family said my sister stole it. My mom split it up between me and my sister, because she didn\u2019t want him to give to his daughter and granddaughter", "I\u2019m so sorry, that\u2019s such disgusting behaviour\n\nIt\u2019s currently all in a biometric safebox in my bedroom but I can move it elsewhere if it becomes necessary although I hope it doesn\u2019t", "Yes. My sister removed the ring off my mothers finger at the funeral home. The ring that was left to my son. It was my fathers\u2019 ring in fact. Last seen on sisters grandson\u2019s finger. Family does indeed show their true colours when death occurs.", "My god how vile. I'm so sorry.", "My aunt took all the rings except for a tarnished one with no stone. That's the one she let me have. It's okay. My grandmother wore it every day, so it's the one I wanted. \n\nThat one turned out to be my grandmother's 1936 24K gold and silver ring. I had it restored and a yellow sapphire put in. It's jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Then my aunt tried to convince me that it was given to me by mistake. I just laughed and laughed. \n\nI never take it off, and it's a half size too small for me. Good luck getting that off my finger, Aunt Gertie!", "My cousin went through my grandma\u2019s jewelry when she was dead on the floor. People ain\u2019t got no class.", "Are at least get a small safe or a lock box and a camera.", "Then future DIL and son will say OP is rubbing the ring in their faces. It's just something else to be upset about. It is OP's ring. All of her jewelry is hers and hers alone. How often OP wears any piece is her business alone. No one has a right to keep score and less of a right to demand it as a gift.", "I might be remembering wrong but it seemed like their relationship went downhill in a big way and the son realized he screwed up.", "Imagine writing out so much just to side with the not even a DIL yet fiancee asking for a personal heirloom from OP. Just imagine.", "You may want to consider including in your will the disposition of your jewelry and other \"heirlooms\".  Have pictures of the jewelry labeled as to which is which (\"emerald ring\", \"sapphire & diamond ring\", etc) so they cannot claim confusion!", "Lock your bedroom when she comes over.  Have the rings insured and photos taken along with serial codes.", "I very much hope it does not become an issue. Good luck!", "Safe deposit box at your bank is the safest place.", "Exactly what I was going to say.  If you don't have a safe, get one.  One that is too heavy to pick up or secure it to the floor so that it can't be tampered with.  Sorry that it has come to that for you, but after such bold rude behavior, I would expect the worst. You decide who gets what and that is done with a will.  NTA.", "NTA. Please will them to your daughter. Now.", "When my great grandmother was nearing death, I had to smuggle jewelry she had promised me out of her house in my bra (with full knowledge and permission of her eldest daughter and holder of her will) because my great uncles were basically looting her house while she was in hospice", "Can I just add here that after one is deceased, the funeral home who picks up the loved one who passed, specifically asks for valuables to be removed if possible. My mother passed this year and she was wearing a couple of rings and some diamond earrings. I removed what I could except the earrings would not come off.  They were added to the inventory list of what she was wearing and I picked them up later on.  I had to sign papers indicating that she had on the earrings. \n\nI guess the motivation of the taker may be considered inappropriate but removing a valuable in and of itself shouldn\u2019t be considered disgusting.", "Huh I guess it did not come off the way I intended at all. I said OP was right to refuse it and that the DIL was rude, tacky, and manipulative, but could be forgiven\n\nEdited to add: I'm not the person OP was initially replying to, maybe that caused some confusion? I never remotely sided with DIL-to-be", "Ooo that\u2019s a good one. Photo proof seals the deal.", "My mother stated that one day in the future, her wedding rings would come  to me because I (F) was the only one of my siblings who wanted to be adopted by our stepdad. He was the only man I ever called Daddy. When one sister found out that I would eventually receive them, she was furious and refused to see the logic of why I was getting them. Fast forward, Mama quietly gives me the rings and I would go out of my way to not wear them around this particular sister. But I forgot one time! We\u2019re at a funeral, it\u2019s cold so my fingers shrunk, and the rings had turned upside down.  During the prayer, THIS sister reached over and turned the rings around to see if they were Mama\u2019s rings!!! After everyone left, the first thing she said was \u201cDid you have to get the rings resized?\u201d I said to myself - the hell with it- and replied, \u201cNope, they fit me Perfectly!! \n\nOP - NTA!! People can just suck and your future DIL is a greedy AH. Hide your jewelry well, get your Will done and specify who gets what OR gift it now.", "Hopefully OP can let the issue die as your comment suggested. But she's not the one causing the conflict so ultimately the fiancee needs to check her avarice first."]}
