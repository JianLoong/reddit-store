Realising your responsibility begins and ends with a small child whose advocates are basically children themselves!! \n\nImagine yourself with your child 20 years from now and the kind of relationship you hope to have with him and any more you have!! It's entirely based on the actions and choices you make that affect his life!!

That\u2019s, like, the bare minimum. Being a good father most of the time doesn\u2019t give you license to be a shit father the rest of the time.
