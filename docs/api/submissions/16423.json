If OP doesn't respond im going to assume all my answers are for the negative.", "My priorities are straight. My son comes first no matter what which is why I asked my brother if he could get him, so at least when I got home he\u2019d be there. Realistically, I probably should\u2019ve just set an alarm and got up to get him but I was with her and I didn\u2019t want to just leave her.", "I saw a tweet recently that was like\u2026\u2018who is the worst person you\u2019ve ever met and why was it the boyfriend you had when you were 19\u2019 and man, was I called out.", "Hope the girl can see the red flags\u2026 21yo deadbeat loser dad who even ask her for gas money so he can have sex\u2026", "And let\u2019s hope no more kids were made while ditching the other one.", "We don\u2019t have a court order it\u2019s just a verbal agreement we come to", "Apparently GF thinks he wasn\u2019t wrong, they deserve each other\u2026", "I get where you're coming from, but for all we know, this may be a rare occurrence. For all we know, he comes through every other time, and this is one of the hypothetical few times he's cancelled. We shouldn't jump to conclusions like this. However in my main comment I have asked these questions.", "He said he \u201cremembered\u201d before going to bed, so this was obviously scheduled ahead of time. \n\nAlso, let\u2019s also consider that if the child needs to be picked up at such odd time, it\u2019s probably because the mom needs to go to work, not just have time off.", "I\u2019ve never cancelled on my son before, I\u2019ve always picked him up no matter what except this one time and she gave me late notice that I was going to be getting him.

Your priorities are not straight in the slightest.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not even touching on the fact that you straight up *forgot* you were supposed to be getting him until a few hours before.", "Bullshit. If he came first and was your number one priority then you wouldn\u2019t have forgotten and made on  as a with your girlfriend. You would have did anything and everything to get him", "Do you understand what \u201ccoming first\u201d means? It isn\u2019t postponing my obligations until I have no better options.", "LMFAO \u201cmy son comes first no matter what\u201d\u2026. Unless it comes to a piece of ass.", "It\u2019s your son \ud83d\ude10 this girl isn\u2019t even your wife.

You are still a boy you need to man up quick", "\u201cMy son comes first not matter what.\u201d As you proceed to give reasons why he actually doesn\u2019t. You said yourself you could have set an alarm or (idk how you forgot you were getting your kid the next day) you could have gone to bed earlier. Then you say you didn\u2019t WANT to leave your girlfriend like that. Want is the key word here. You just proved yourself wrong.\n\nSecondly, your girlfriend if she\u2019s going to be with someone with a child needs to understand that child comes first she comes second. The only person to get upset with is you for your poor planning skills, lack of commitment to your child, and lack of responsibility for again even forgetting you\u2019re getting your kid the next day. \n\nIf I were her I\u2019d see this as a red flag for what\u2019s to come in the future.", "Obviously your son DOESN'T come first no matter what because you didn't put him first this time.\n\nTbh, if being with your girlfriend keeps you from keeping your commitment to your son every single time, then you need to not date her at all.

So he comes second. I wish I could downvote more than once. \n\nTroll harder. This was terrible. 0/10", "It\u2019s honestly already insane to pick up a one year old at 4:30 am as it messes up their sleep schedule. But can you imagine how shocking it would be for a little baby to be picked up by your brother? Unless your son is more familiar with him than you.", "You literally  just put yourself first then your gf", "He comes first unless you get to do the dirty with your gf right ?", "She clearly doesn\u2019t because you should have went to bed sooner and set an alarm.

If your son came first you would have been responsible and prioritized picking him up. If your son came first, you would not have any question about leaving your girlfriend to go get your son. You would feel worse about neglecting your son to be with your girlfriend. In literally every single way in this situation you put your son last. \n\nWhich role is more important to you - father or boyfriend? Last night your actions show that you decided that boyfriend was a more important part to play than father.

Excuse me sir?! Coming first doesn\u2019t mean asking someone else to do it. Coming first means sucking it up when it sucks to wake up early and missing out on a few hours of sleep, even with your gf. You actively chose her over your responsibilities to your child (ie you chose her over your child) there\u2019s no other way to look at this. You\u2019re a parent now.

Be a good parent.", "You have got to be joking or you are OPs girlfriend lol", "Op replied to me. He said this is a first he has cancelled*, and if that's true, he has picked him up every other time. OPs ex also gave late notice and had actually had plans with girlfriend before the ex had actually unformed him of picking up their son.", "Follow-up question:\n\nHow long was the notice? And why the short notice?\n\nSo far, I'm leaning N.T.A, but I'm also leaning E.S.H.", "Yep, that was some weird ass bs. But we can all relax. He and his new girlfriend think it\u2019s okay.", "Except when sex is involved\u2026 the his son can gtfo /s", "I\u2019m sure he does, but not in this context\u2026", "It is ridiculous and he was going to be super fussy and in a bad mood if I had gotten him at that time, but I was still willing to do so.

I regret every moment ever spent with that human.", "Yeah, nah, I don't have the patience currently to date anyone with kids. I'm more likely to develop patience when I have my own. However, no, I'm not kidding. He never stated that he's cancelled before (which I did ask in my main comment waiting for his reply)  so instantly jumping to dead beat without actually knowing this is a bit of a jump. I am more than happy to edit my replies if/when he replies.", "I will actually reply instead of editing because I just wanted to let you know, he has replied. I'll copy and paste his reply below:\n\n\"I\u2019ve never cancelled on my son before, I\u2019ve always picked him up no matter what except this one time, and she gave me late notice that I was going to be getting him. To be fair, I had plans with my girlfriend before I knew I had to even get my son.\"\n\nI asked how long ago the late notice was, but see (again based on if it's true). we can't just instantly jump to deadbeat when we don't have all the facts.", "Regardless on when he agreed to take care of his son, it happened before 12:30 am. If you are a responsible parent, when you agree to take care of your child, you cancel other plans. If he wasn\u2019t willing to cancel, he should\u2019ve not accepted to pick him up! \nAITA is supposed to be about choosing your AHoleness level for the topic described by OP, not his whole lifetime as a father. Anything he\u2019s done in the past is irrelevant. He asked if he was an asshole for failing to pick up his son at a predetermined time, and the answer is yes. :)", "That took me a moment LOL", "Oh my god I needed that laugh so badly after reading this thread, thank you", "You have an obligation, and you know it. YTA, you owe your ex (who covered for your lazy ass) an apology, and you need to step and grow up. Stop acting like an entitled child.", "Maybe you should have offered to pick him up the night before, then. I\u2019m guessing that she had to be at work or something?", "Why did you need to pick him up at 4:30am", "Obviously you weren't willing to do it", "Are you sure? Probably video games are above the kid!", "This a partially agree with (I replied to someone who just instantly jumped to dead beat without all the facts before).\n\nI wouldn't say OP should have to cancel his plans, more just change them up a bit. See if OPs girlfriend was OK with OP staying a few hours over spending the night even though it's rare to see her (and then set an alarm to go home). I'm leaning ESH because of this. His kid is definitely no.1 priority I fully agree on this, but there shouldn't have been any late notice and OP should have either said no or changed his plans to accommodate his son (pick him up a day early to accommodate whatever his ex had to do. Assumingly work considering 4:30 am wake up)", "Exactly what I meant to say! Lol my comment came off as me justifying him, but yeah, I was basically asking why he is picking him up at that time and not having him spend the night with him."]}
