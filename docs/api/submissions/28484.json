A month before the trip, I had $800 saved up for spending money. Unfortunately, my twin was involved in a hit and run and he never caught the guy. His deductable was $1500 at the time and his car needed repairs quick so he can drive it to work. I offered to split the cost with him and that was that.\n\nA week before my trip, I only saved up $250. I was content with it. Out of nowhere, my ex gives me $350 to spend. I was estatic to say the least. He has NEVER spent a single dollar on me. I am not kidding. So when I received the $350 I was incredibly happy, but then he said I had to pay him back when I got back from my trip.. it was a bit of a let down but I accepted with ease. \n\nWhen I came back from my trip, I spent the next few weeks saving up to pay him back. Then my mom ends up in the ER because she broke her wrist while lifting heavy pots in her garden. The ER bill was only a few hundred, but my dad couldn't pay since he doesn't make too much money. My mom was on a LOA from her job, so not much money at the time for her either. My twin and I split the cost just fine. When I told my ex about it though, he said I can take my time to pay him back. I was grateful.\n\nAbout two weeks after my mom's ER trip, he steals my car for a joyride with his friends. I was taking a shower at the time he left. He told me he was gonna go out and I didn't think much of it. While he was out he ended up rear ending a mother who was driving home with her child. The mother sustained a few injuries but the child's neck faced severe whiplash. When he came home, he was drunk. I still didn't think much of it until I saw him drop my car keys from his hand. I immediately felt a pit in my stomach and ran outside and saw my car's whole front bumper was gone! Engine hood folded in like paper. After questioning him, he admitted it was a hit and run and even thought it was so cool of him that he got away \"so easily\". I hit up the police and my insurance immediately and told them the truth about what happened. My insurance said to sit tight and wait to see if someone reports to their insurance regarding the accident. A few days later, someone did. I cut ties with my ex shortly after he refused to pay for the damages he caused.\n\nYesterday I get a random call and a voicemail was left by my ex. He is demanding for the $350 back and said he needs it to pay his bail bond. Wtf? I called him back and basically told him to F himself and that I don't owe him anything. He called me stingy and said he has done nothing but support me and the least I could do was pay him back. I was never supported by him in any way and definitely not financially, but a part of me wants to be a good person and pay him back..\n\nAITA for refusing to pay him back?", "created_utc": 1696746159, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/172s1j4/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_ex_back/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm guessing it was more than the $350. You should go after him for the cost of whatever you paid in deductible, losing the use of your car for however long, and, if your insurance went up, then that cost as well.", "NTA - He stole your car and caused an accident that injured others. Hope you pressed charges. No, you don't owe him money. He owes you lots once you total his damages; this is your retort.", "Nta damaging your car and causing harm to a child.

You want to do this to help keep your premiums down.  Also do you have out of pocket expenses, like a deductible or repairs?  If so sue him for those also.  I wouldn't respond to him directly.", "NTA\n\nYou owe your ex $350 - it was a loan given in good faith and it would be unethical to just refuse to pay him back.\n\nHowever, he also owes you all of the costs related to his theft of your car - repairs, increased insurance costs, rentals and other expenses while without your vehicle, etc. So rather than handing him $350, taking it off his debt would seem reasonable.\n\nThe fact that it potentially screws him over when he needs the money to pay a ball bond is just karma for his actions.\n\nSuing him for the money he owes you would also seem justified, though given his current predicament I am not sure you would ever actually receive anything.", "Nta damnit your car and cashing harm to a child.

The loan is already paid off, but it definitely did hurt me financially. The accident also affected my insurance rates to jump really high.. it's still high to this day.. after I had cut ties with my ex it seemed like he fell off the face of the earth because no one was able to get in contact with him (my insurance lady tried to get a statement from him). Other than that, I didn't really face much legal repercussions. I do keep in contact with the mom and child just to make sure they are ok :)", "What?  Why would she pay him anything after he wrecked her car?", "OP said in a comment that the accident cost them over $4000 all in all, paying their deductible and then medical expenses for the child/mother, they had to take out a loan to cover it all.", "Yeah you don't owe him jack.

Never enable that kind of sh*t. If I got that wrong I apologise.", "WTF did I just read? How are you on the hook for the damages he caused? And in what world does it make sense that you owe him any money? Lawyer up and go after him, like yesterday!
