None. Even if you were over there 7 days a week, the expectation would be that you would pitch in with the messes you make- dishes, garbage, etc- but I have never done the actual housework of someone I was dating (dusting, full vacuum, full clean of the bathroom) unless we lived together. And I would never expect my partner to clean my home, just pick up after themselves and help with a big project every now and then (help me move a couch or hang a light). \n\nThen add to that, you may not have a full time job, but school is a full time job. And even if you just sat around all day, until he is paying your bills, it isn't his problem. I believe that whichever partner works less- or not at all- should do more around the home, regardless of gender or even how much money they make/bills they cover. So for example, if I cover 75% of the bills, but I work 40 hours and work from home, and my partner pays 25% of the bills but works 40 hours and commutes 2 hours a day, I should do a bit more around the home since I have more time. \n\nAnd I didn't even need to write all that out because YOU DON'T LIVE TOGETHER and he isn't funding your life. \n\nThis guy is telling you how he views you and probably gender roles. How much you work/who pays for you simply isn't his problem, and he clearly thinks having a 19 year old girlfriend with free time means he DESERVES a maid.

Two people can decide, or fate (loss of job, no money for child care) can decide for them, that the best arrangement for one is to work for an employer and the other to take care of the domestic work. *But that's a mutual decision that needs to be made based on equality, and the homemaker needs to have free access to some of the income generated by the breadwinner.*", "You're going to school, that is your work right now.
