None. Even if you were over there 7 days a week, the expectation would be that you would pitch in with the messes you make- dishes, garbage, etc- but I have never done the actual housework of someone I was dating (dusting, full vacuum, full clean of the bathroom) unless we lived together. And I would never expect my partner to clean my home, just pick up after themselves and help with a big project every now and then (help me move a couch or hang a light). \n\nThen add to that, you may not have a full time job, but school is a full time job. And even if you just sat around all day, until he is paying your bills, it isn't his problem. I believe that whichever partner works less- or not at all- should do more around the home, regardless of gender or even how much money they make/bills they cover. So for example, if I cover 75% of the bills, but I work 40 hours and work from home, and my partner pays 25% of the bills but works 40 hours and commutes 2 hours a day, I should do a bit more around the home since I have more time. \n\nAnd I didn't even need to write all that out because YOU DON'T LIVE TOGETHER and he isn't funding your life. \n\nThis guy is telling you how he views you and probably gender roles. How much you work/who pays for you simply isn't his problem, and he clearly thinks having a 19 year old girlfriend with free time means he DESERVES a maid.

Who in their right mind thinks their SO should be cleaning *their* house because they happen to have more free time??", "Love the use of DTMF\u2014we need it more in this sub.", "Yeah no kidding, I never 180\u2019d in a post faster lmao", "They are the same dudes who screech about alimony too.", "Ikr? I had to read the post twice to try to understand why the BF was being so entitled. NTA if OP leaves him. There's plenty of good men that'll treat her well out there.", "Oh absolutely!  There\u2019s another post on here talking about how there is something \u201cinsidious\u201d with this guy\u2019s behavior, and that poster explained it way better than I could.  \n\nThis post really gave me the creeps.  OP please listen, this guy is no good for you.  He went after a 19-year-old student and then started harping on the fact that you don\u2019t work - well a) that\u2019s not true - you do work a little bit, and b) no shit, students don\u2019t work full time!  Why get in a relationship with someone just to criticize them for where they are in life? \n\nPlus, he\u2019s soooo manipulative.  He\u2019s saying it\u2019s unfair that you don\u2019t have to work while still affording rent, but you took out loans, so it\u2019s NOT free money; you have to pay it back, and his argument is purely to coerce you into providing him with free labor.  If he actually cared about you, he\u2019d encourage you to study hard or even work a little more in your downtime, so that you will be better positioned to pay off those loans when you graduate. But OP, he doesn\u2019t care about you, he only cares about himself, what he can get from you.  \n\nAnd people like this are so fundamentally lacking in self-esteem that they have no clue how to really be happy.  And because of that, he will chew you up and do his best to break your spirit because your happiness is a threat to him.", "According to his thinking he already has her doing the cooking and \"chores\". Why not go for broke? Honestly stop cooking for him unless it's his birthday and no chores. You are not his Mommy or maid. Concentrate on your schooling and your life.", "\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd I was replying to some other AITA post about a gronk wearing a suit to work....no idea how it ended up here, I've never even seen this AITA.", ">Who in their right mind thinks their SO should be cleaning their house because they happen to have more free time??\n\nCan't speak to the house cleaning part, but when I was in college, I had a boyfriend who insisted that I was to do his laundry. We lived in separate dorms, on separate parts of campus, and I studied four times harder than he did. He would keep asking \"when are you gonna do my laundry?\" He also had the sick belief that if we got married I had to bear 7 children for him. \n\nAfter I dumped him he called my parents to get my sister's phone number then called my sister telling her that there must be something mentally wrong with me because I broke up with him. Her response was that everyone in the family thought there was something mentally wrong with me because I was dating him!\n\nEdited to add judgement: NTA.", "Even if they did live together, she wouldn't be the AH. She sounds pretty busy (full time student plus part time work). Does she even have more free time??", "Lmao ikr?! I thought this lazy Biotch! and than she\u2019s like \u201cI have my own place and don\u2019t work because I\u2019m still at university.\u201d It all changed immediately to this guy is a walking \ud83d\udea9. It\u2019s been 5 months and he\u2019s convincing you that you need to wait on him hand and foot cause he works? I\u2019m guessing you are still in school how Nagy hours a week go to this alone. Not to mention chores and upkeep of your own home. Nta", "Same, bc of the title, but then once I read the post it was an easy NTA. OP, get rid of your bf, he's going to drag you down and I guarantee his expectations won't improve at all.", "> DTMF\n\nWhat does this stand for?  Other than Dual-Tone Multifrequency.", "And golddiggers lol", "I love your sister's response!", "Sister is a keeper", "Technically, it\u2019s DTMFA or dump the mother f***er already.
