If your step children are about to take on a lot of debt, seeing their kid sibling inherit a massive amount of money might sting. \n\nAt the end of the day, if all your kids have enough financial support to have approximately the same opportunities, I think your choice makes sense.

Wanting to provided equally for all his kids is natural.   You're also right, that grannies  money isn't for everyone to split but here's the thing.

As it stand inheritances in most states are not marital property. However I do not know if you sell the property if it makes it marital property or not. So that\u2019s a question for a lawyer. \n\nIf you sale the property and the money becomes a marital asset. You may be better off and hold on to the property as is. This away your spouse has no say on what happens. If you have to set on the asset for a while it takes any discussion on who gets what. Make sure that you tell the lawyer upon something happening to you that this is sold and put into a iron clad trust for your son. \n\nIf the sale doesn\u2019t make the money earned marital property then I would set it. \nBut I wouldput the money in a trust that only you can control. I would fix it to where if something happened to you then your son and any future bio kids would inherit that trust. But make sure your husband can not touch it. If redit has taught us anything it is that spouses do not have your child\u2019s best interest at heart and they will take the fund and split it. It has also taught us that the spouse will use it on a child that is not biologically yours and leave your son nothing.\n\nI recommend doing the above for several reasons. \n\n1- being that if something should happen the money is still yours. Given how your husband is acting entitled to spend this money is a red flag. If your marriage should end you have money set aside. This is always good to have as a exit plan. No one plans on a divorce but in this case a way out may not be a bad thing.\n\n2- by doing the trust this way if you choose to have another child then they can receive a equal share between your 2 kids. \n\nBut like I said first and foremost contact a lawyer in your area and discuss all options.
