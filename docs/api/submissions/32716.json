That means that she is a guest in your house and considering the house only has two bedrooms, it is totally unreasonable for your husband to want to commit the second bedroom to be his sister's.\n\nAside from how you (as in you personally and you and your husband together) would want to be using this room, it is not reasonable for a guest to have 50% of the bedrooms allocated to them for their main/sole use.\n\nIt's great your husband is this close with his young sister but now that you and your husband will live together, you should come to decisions on how the house is to be used TOGETHER. That means that you both need to agree on how this second bedroom is going to be used.\n\nOF COURSE you two want to be able to host (a) guest(s) and it sounds like making this second room into the guest room/vanity room would meet both your wants of having a vanity space for yourself as well as your husband's wants of having a bed for his sister to sleep in. But obviously his sister wouldn't be dictating how the room would be decorated.\n\nIt sounds like your husband has made up his mind about this room for his sister, so it might be a difficult discussion to have with him. I think you need to approach this from an angle of finding a middle ground, like making the room mixed use (vanity/guest room), and you can suggest that you and his sister decorate the room TOGETHER as a bonding experience as you will both be using this room. Then you can control how the guest room is decorated considering it's your house (shared with husband), and if you are considerate to the sister and also cater to some of her ideas, then you get to have fun with her together, become closer to her, and also avoid this becoming a (massive) issue with your husband. She's 10 now so may have a more childish taste than you yourself have but you can probably find a middle ground? Maybe there's small stuff that can easily be put up/taken down that she'd like in there when she stays over?\n\nHave you talked to your husband about how often he expects his sister to stay the night? Is this a couple of times a year, once a month, once a week, or several nights a week? Are you ok with that? Are you planning on kids, and if so, any time soon, and are you happy to have the sister over as often when you have your own kids? Just some things to think about and have chats with your husband about.\n\nPS: One thing to think about is whether you are worried the sister will start snooping/using your products if she is sleeping in the guest room/vanity room, and if you are, how you will solve this (lockable cabinets?).", "It's concerning that he doesn't think you get a say in this. He's your husband, not a king.\n\nNTA, but he is.", "Nta. That sounds like an exhausting and unfair battle", "Exactly I find it weird that she would have a room which he isn\u2019t understanding, like that is not normal this is Our personal space", "I am I\u2019ve said it\u2019s not happening, genuinely frustrated because he\u2019s delusional thinking I\u2019m in the wrong\ud83e\udd23 honestly it\u2019s pi**ing me off.", "No they just sleep in the same room, due to space but no him and his brother are moving out freeing up a room for her to stay in", "It didn't say she can't sleep NOT NEXT to him, just without him (present).", "It's not strange to occasionally share a bedroom with a (much) younger sibling. They are family, after all.", "Yeah I\u2019m 100% she\u2019s not his, he\u2019s his only sister, and she was born with a heart condition so had a few surgeries so he\u2019s very fond of her, due to thinking she wasn\u2019t going to make it", "Yes I do not mind decorating With her I think that\u2019s a beautiful idea, it\u2019s just the fact that she now believes it\u2019s her room and she has authority over it which isn\u2019t the case. He said she\u2019ll be staying \u2018here and there\u2019 I said here and there should be once every few weeks and she does kind of listen to stuff we say and go back and tell her parents. But it\u2019s just that I also want my own space, I\u2019ve lived with children my whole life and just want peace", "Not to be a Debbie downer but I get the vibe this man won\u2019t put you first \u2026 like those TikTok challenges where men rank their mom daughter and spouse, spouse is dead last\u2026.. that\u2019s what this is giving", "Setting that room up as hers will be a problem if/when you ever have a child, who would obviously get that room...", "NTA.  He needs to put you first.  She is not his wife nor is he her parent.  This is a hill to die on.", "Hi, I totally understand your view.\n\nI think your husband spoke to soon. I'd talk with him about you feel that he acts like he's the only one who owns/lives in the home, and that this isn't alright considering it's also your home. Does he own the home? Even if you own none of it/didn't pay anything into it, you two are married now and are living together making you both the main residents. This means that any decisions on how the rooms are to be used and if/how long guests can stay should be discussed between the two of you before any promises are made to other people (this also applies to you: do not promise to let a friend stay over without first discussing it with your husband).\n\nIf he owns the home/paid all or most of it, maybe he still feels like it's HIS home, but he can't be having that attitude when he lives there with his partner (you). If this is his attitude, you need to resolve this sooner rather than later. If you let him continue to have this attitude, a few months or years from now he's going to offer/promise a homeless friend to move into the guest room for 'however long you need to get back on your feet' or he might offer it as a 'crash pad' for a friend with relationship problems, etc. It's much harder to have this discussion then, when you have some guy setting up camp in there for who knows how long and \"I can't throw my friend out on the street\" etc.\n\nAnother way you can be generous is to let the sister have her own shelf/drawer where she can store some staple clothes and basic toiletries for when she stays over.\n\nIf the sister asks you \"But HUSBAND promised me that this is my room?!\", you can tell her \"HUSBAND did indeed promise this room to you, but that's without having talked to me about it. He is still getting used to him and me living together, so he kind of forgot that I live here too now! You are welcome to stay the night when you visit, and I would love to decorate the room together with you, but the main use of this room will be a guest room, for you, but also for when my mother/father/friend visits, and I will also put my makeup table here. Would you like to see my makeup?\" and then move the conversation on to you showing her your makeup, whatever. She is 10, she doesn't live there, and your husband should talk to her about his promise. Alternatively, if she doesn't bring it up again to him or you, just continue on with your plans for decorating and ask her for her help, and don't even mention the promise. If she then says \"Oh, I thought this was going to be my room?!\", then you can tell her as I wrote about/explain the situation/you can tell her to talk to your husband about it. But considering this is your home too, I think you are well within your right to tell her what the situation is. And it's not a discussion, it's just you telling her the room will be a guest room/vanity room. There is no negotiation for her to make demands on this room, it's not her house, she doesn't live there.", "Oh yeah, I hope I am wrong, but I wouldn't be surprised if husband is putting OP last, after the sister (when the sister has her parents who should be putting her first).", "Yeah he\u2019s the one who\u2019s bought it so definitely thinks he\u2019s got authority but tbh idc because it\u2019s our house if I\u2019m also helping him with stuff, regardless we\u2019re married it\u2019s automatically halved. But yh I don\u2019t mind giving little things like shelves like. I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m not raising another kid it\u2019s genuinely stressful as I had to raise my own siblings due to my parents putting that responsibility on me I don\u2019t want it again", "Explain to your husband that his sister is not his daughter and that his sister is not your child.\n\nYour husband is putting his sister ahead off you,  putting her first. You're his wife, inviting anyone to sleep over should be discussed and agreed or doesn't happen.\n\nWhat does can't sleep without him mean? Same bed? Same bedroom? Why has no one delt with this unhealthy dependency? \n\nIts also concerning that your husband is kicking you out of utilizing the 2nd bedroom as you want and giving it to his sister. This is YOUR house, not his sister's. Why bother marry you?  Why not just get his own home and move his sister in? \n\nHe is also coming across that your can't even decorate it as a guest bedroom. In fact this will be his sister's bedroom and there will be no room for guests. Let alone using the space the way you want. \n\nThis is a hill to die on because this will set the tone for the rest of your marriage. You'll either be happy or 2nd class citizen in your own home and relationship. \n\nTell your husband that the room is being set up for you - whether vanity, crafts, etc.  That it'll have a bed for guests but will not be his sister's 2nd bedroom. \n\nAlso decide now how often she can sleep over and visit - once a month is often enough, she can visit during the day and go home at night. If she damages your things,  no more sleep overs.  Plus they'll are things you don't want to discuss with her in the house. You and your husband need don't to be couples in the weekend and you can't do that will his sister. Husband's attention should be on you and you in him,  not the sister.\n\nYou might have to tell him - if he doesn't agree then you realize you're not compatible after all because you didn't sign up for sharing your house with his sister. \n\nBe ready to pack your things and move out since the marriage will crumble anyway.\n\nNTA", "NTA.
