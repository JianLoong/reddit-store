He has three kids with his ex \"James\" (m19), \"Charlotte\" (f16) and \"Matt\" (m14). His custody agreement is 70-30 with his ex wife so the youngest kids are only a couple days a week with us. I am pregnant with our first baby now, I'm 12 weeks. \n\nAround 5 months ago James moved in with us completely since our house is closer to his college, before that he was sharing an apartment with a friend but they got into an argument. \n\nSo since he moved in, him and I have gotten closer, we never really had a chance to bond before since when my husband and I moved in together he was already living alone. Of course we we cordial to each other and such, but I wasn't as close to him as I am with his siblings since they stay over sometimes. \n\nNow, since I don't have a job, we spend lots of time together and we have bonded a lot recently. He usually has classes during the morning so the three of us have breakfast together and then my husband and him are both off to work/ college. Him and I have lunch together and usually watch a movie/ tv show together afterwards or we do something else. He's studying sociology which I studied too so often he asks me for help and I gladly help him. \n\nSometimes we also go out just the two of us since my husband sometimes is too tired or has to work until late. We sometimes go to the park/ the mall or go to eat, stuff like that. Sometimes we also have \"sleepovers\" when my husband has to travel for work.\n\nMy husband's ex already expressed that she's annoyed by this and told him to step back because it's inappropriate for us to be that close (James told me this). However she was only annoyed up to this point, but last week she found out that James went with me to my doctor's appointment since my husband couldn't and she got very angry. He said she told him off because he shouldn't do that and people will think that he's the dad of my baby. They argued and now he's not on good terms with his mom. I feel sad although he told me not to worry about it, my husband also think I should drop it but a friend told me I should put some boundaries between me and my step son. Aita?\n\n\nEdit since is being asked a lot, when we have \"sleepovers\" we watch tv, eat pizza, maybe i help with homework if he needs it and then we sleep in sleeping bags (separately) in the living room.

In all honesty, I found her to be more of a better influence on my brother and me than my genetic mother (who I still love). My dad asked me to teach her how to drive and we would sometimes go to lunch or dinner together.\n\nSimilar to your situation, my dad asked me to take her to the hospital when she was pregnant with my younger brother and he was busy with work.

I would also do what I could to help her with my little brother. That experience helped me prepare when my wife was pregnant with my kids.\n\nSo yeah, NTA.

But I think the concern people are trying to convey is that you being overly eager/over compensating to bond might eventually give him mixed emotions over time and could easily unintentionally develop feelings deeper than a stepson/stepmom relationship \u2014 which will just cause for a lot of uncomfortable vibes for everyone involved. \n\nOverall, I would just be mindful of how you\u2019re developing your parental relationship with your adult stepson with this new transition of him moving in because this could get pretty weird, pretty fast.", "YTA  You're taking a huge risk here.  You need to think about his.", "NTA\n\nEveryone who thinks it's \"creepy\" or \"inappropriate\" or \"ick\" is exposing themselves. There is nothing unusual or wrong about a platonic relationship between people of different genders of similar age. Anyone who thinks this type of relationship is automatically sexual in nature - you're the weirdo.", "I agree. It's so hard to verbalise exactly WHY this gives me the ick becuase shes not technically going anything wrong but it just... It's just not right. It feels like a dangerous slippery slope. Like we're one 'sleepover' away from 'whoops had too much wine and got a little too close'", "Yeah, the doctor's appointment really tipped it.  Even if, genuinely, there is no sexual attraction on either side of the equation, that strikes me as her using him as an emotional crutch while the dad is away.  It's inappropriate.", "The only gross people are those in the comments. They watch too much porn and probably never had a normal platonic relationship.i can't explain the hysterics here any other way", "Imagine if a 28-year-old man came on reddit and talked about having \"sleepovers\" with his wife's 19-year-old daughter. People would be savage.", "I know you wouldn\u2019t be posting this unless you had pure intentions.  I hope you get the answers you need <3", "My dad (bio) and I were super close until he died last year. There was some years in my teens and early 20s where people would side eye us or openly stare. And all we did was joke around. We weren't touchy, we didn't say anything remotely implying we were a couple. ok there was the one time but dude was really staring and even said something about creepy old me, so I grabbed my dad's arm (which I'd never do) and was like \"oh sweety look at ...\".  Dad was kinda shocked for a second then just enjoyed it.\n\nTold me later when we talked about it that he'd thought of doing similar but he wasn't about to cross that boundary because he didn't want to upset me and even bringing up seemed weird. It was the only time we did something like that but that guy was so assumptive verbally and rude I just wasn't having it.\n\nAnd you can't really tell on ages, I look young still in my 40s, just in the last 6 months had a friend's wife of my husband and a tree guy shocked by my age. I could see why one might think the tree guy was being nice but he was in his late 20s and had already said he was autistic which I'd already assumed he had something going on cause of a variety of things (none bad!). Dude's doing great for his age and having a productive career he's really good at, and I told him that too later on. And my mom also always looked young up until her late 60s, people would refer to her as my dad's daughter. My dad looked his age which wasn't much older than her.\n\nLike sure you can assume relationships and who's who, but you never know and it's just ignorant even if they all look their age, they could just be friends unless you see PDA.", "You admit that she likely knows something you don\u2019t. Maybe listen to her. And no, she\u2019s not gonna share that suspicion with you if she thinks that you are not creating boundaries which could give the impression you are intentionally inviting that crush, which I don\u2019t think is the case but you\u2019re just being naive. But you\u2019ve had 90% of this comment thread say the same thing so maybe listen to that perspective?", "But the thing is, OP is NOT this child\u2019s parent, she\u2019s a woman who\u2019s only 9 years older than him doing sleepovers. That\u2019s not the same at all", "The age differences at play are huge factors you are ignoring. Your kid isn\u2019t gonna have a typical sibling relationship with the older kids. Just the facts - they won\u2019t be raised in the same house and they won\u2019t be of the same generation.\n\nYou need to get your head out of the sand and realize that this 19 yr old doesn\u2019t view you as a parent. You didn\u2019t raise him. Your only 9 yrs older than him and you met him when he was 17. This is so creepy. I think you\u2019re being so stubborn and ignoring the majority of this sub, and shit is gonna blow up in your face. I could totally see if you keep this up, this 19 yr old makes a move on you bc 19 yr olds are dumb and fall hard and quick. A slightly older woman paying attn to him, sleeping next to him, he\u2019s gonna get feelings", "I was on board the \"weird relationship developing\" bandwagon, but even then, I need to point out that knowing someone 1-2 years is PLENTY of time to develop a close relationship with someone.\n\nI don't necessarily think OP is sleeping with teenage step-son, but I don't trust her intentions either, if this story is even real. It's weird, and it gets weirder by calling it a \"sleepover\" when your stepson stays at your house - it just weirds me out for some reason. He can come over and watch movies and stay the night, but why turn it into a thing like a sleepover?\n\nThen I think about how she's basically a child still, too, and of course she thinks that way.", "Reading this sub definitely isn't going to help anyone in that venture.", "That's the vibe I got. And the son is actually more age appropriate than the husband if you looked only at age gaps. (Just give it a few more years)", "Someday soon there\u2019s gonna be a kid out there telling his friends \u2018my half brother is also my (step)dad!\u2019", "You think a 28 year old woman is still a child?", "You are naive.", "Nope.. just porn and Reddit. Thx", "I love your username!", "A man she's only known for 2 years maximum, since she's been seeing her husband for only 2 years, married 1.", "She's young, she's acting in a child like way. At 28 she's still a kid to me, who's at a bit more than her husband's age. Shit, my oldest kid is older than her, so yeah, she's kid aged to me.", "LOL He's 19, not 9. This all sounds so odd. Would a 28-year-old step dad having \"sleepovers\" with their 19-year-old sound as innocuous?", "With what you know about newly adult teenage males, do you think that having a sleepover and roasting marshmallows is on the top twenty five list of things they would do with another male friend?", "yes. now stop being a weird coomer", "Les am\u00e9ricains sont tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent que les fran\u00e7ais", "Oh this explains a lot for me, actually. My old boss was French and she was baffled by so many American norms around relationships and intimacy (I\u2019m American and we were all living in the US).\n\nPlatonic intimacy is much more normal in France than in America; we are ultimately still quite puritanical about anything sex or reproduction related (including ultrasounds). Here, the arrangement you described would admittedly be weird because, culturally, we have pretty firm boundaries around \u201cacceptable\u201d forms of intimacy in different relationships. Given that you met James as a teenager and are not that much older than him, many Americans will automatically see that relationship as \u201ctoo intimate\u201d and assume it will lead to one or both of you developing romantic feelings and/ or having sex. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if, culturally, the \u201cappropriate\u201d boundaries are different in France. I just don\u2019t know where they are because I\u2019m not French. \n\nUltimately, I think it\u2019s a matter of trust and communication for everyone involved. If you and your husband trust each other and James as family, and the three of you are all comfortable with the arrangement, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inherently wrong. It sounds like you have pure intentions, just obviously make sure it stays that way for both you and James. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised is the ex is mostly pissed because your husband married a younger woman that now has a good relationship with her kid. (Edit: fixed a typo)", "I don\u2019t think you are intentionally trying to do something, you\u2019re just being oblivious and ignoring normal dynamics with 19 yrs olds. They don\u2019t typically spend lots of time with their \u201cparental figures\u201d - they spend time with friends. Assuming this 19 yr old is straight, it\u2019s pretty easy to get feelings for someone who cares for you and hangs out with you a lot and isn\u2019t that much older. You have a responsibility to prevent that kinda thing from happening and that happens with better boundaries."]}
