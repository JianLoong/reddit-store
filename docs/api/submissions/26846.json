Since then she's been jumping from low class job to low class job and it seems like she has lost all motivation of doing anything meaningful with her life. At the start of this year she introduced to think this man (mid 20s I think) as her new boyfriend. For a laborer he seemed like a decent enough guy, even though I was a little put off at how he'd sometimes start muttering to himself, but my daughter eventually told me that he has schizophrenia, but that he's on meds for it in order to manage his symptoms and that I don't need to worry.\n\nHowever last week she announced that she got pregnant by the same schizophrenic boyfriend and that they already made plans to move in together by the end of this month. Honestly I felt so disappointed in her, not only did she tie down and plans to raise child(ren) with a man that needs constant medication to not be a danger to himself or the people around them, but she exposed her future child(ren) to the same fate as him, as schizophrenia is likely to pass onto generations and now at best my grandchildren will either needs to sustain themselves on meds for the rest of their lives as well or will straight up be locked up cause of their mental illness.\n\nI told my daughter that she was incredibly irresponsible to get pregnant out of wedlock by a man who's gonna pass his mental illness to her children, especially when neither of them are even well off cause of her giving up her college prospects, she told me that they didn't plan for this child but they want to keep it and that she loves this man and she's willing to raise a family with him regardless of their struggles they'll face, I reminded her that while love is nice, it won't solve all of the financial and medical problems her unborn kid will suffer from cause of her poor life decisions. However she suddenly started having a screaming tantrum about me not supporting her poor life decisions, I told her that I'm not gonna support whatever mess she landed herself into, which ended up with my daughter literally cursing me out and then storming off.\n\nToday I received a message from my daughter's boyfriend (my daughter hasn't contacted me after our fight) where he told me that I'm a psychopathic monster for making my daughter cry for 2 days straight and to go to hell. Frankly I don't know if I even want to respond to this message considering how unstable this man is, however I do want to know if what I told my daughter could've been taken in the wrong way, after all I still want what's my best for her.\n\nAITA ?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1694705576, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ili5v/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_she_ruined_her/", "score": 2238, "replies": ["#This is now a Proctologists Only Orifice\r\n\r\nWhen a post is in [POO\u2122 mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168bzq8/title_aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2023) only users with enough subreddit comment karma are able to comment.

Better to get schizophrenia than any of your personality traits (in case this is not just some ragebait). \n\nOkay, to make it more precise.\n1.) This whole thing reeks of classicism.

You reduced him to his illness. It is like reducing someone who sits in a wheelchair to him not being able to walk.

While some of your concerns i could understand in theory (the risk of inheriting schizophrenia for example should be taken into account as much as any other inheritable serious illness when considering getting kids), it comes from a place of pseudo-aristocratic spite, and therefore I would say it is better if you will be left out if the future family to be, no matter if the kids inherit the illness or not.

Yes, you should not have to financially support your daughter and the decisions she makes for her life. What you can do is be there for her emotionally.

This is why you see those straight A students whose parents were so worried about their GPA working as a waitress or in a lower officer job, because their anxiety just can't handle the pressure they had their whole life. So, your daughter and her boyfriend are in a lower class than you. You just need to be there for your daughter and if all these problems that you are imagining actually happen then you can tell her you told her so or tell her she got into this mess she has to get herself out.

Since then she's been jumping from low class job to low class job and it seems like she has lost all motivation of doing anything meaningful with her life.

For a laborer he seemed like a decent enough guy, even though I was a little put off at how he'd sometimes start muttering to himself, but my daughter eventually told me that he has schizophrenia, but that he's on meds for it in order to manage his symptoms and that I don't need to worry.\n\nHowever last week she announced that she got pregnant by the same schizophrenic boyfriend and that they already made plans to move in together by the end of this month.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. Let\u2019s unpack the many reasons why:\n\n1. Judging your daughter for having \u201clow class jobs\u201d and leaving med school. She decided that it wasn\u2019t for her and now she\u2019s supporting herself while trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life instead of being a doctor. Her protecting her mental health by taking herself out of a high stress situation is not a bad thing at all.\n\n2. Judging your daughter\u2019s boyfriend for having a blue collar job. \u201cDecent enough guy for a laborer\u201d isn\u2019t a compliment towards him, it\u2019s an insult to all laborers (including him) by inherently assuming something negative about them because of there job until the prove themselves to be otherwise.\n\n3. Having zero understanding of schizophrenia. Not all people with schizophrenia are dangerous and the fact that he\u2019s open about it and taking his medication is an amazing thing and shows how well he\u2019s doing because it\u2019s really hard for people with schizophrenia to stick to taking their medication. People with schizophrenia can live completely normal lives, as your daughter\u2019s boyfriend is proving. You didn\u2019t know about his diagnosis until you were told because he\u2019s clearly not acting in the stereotypical way you imagine people with schizophrenia acting. They don\u2019t need to be \u201clocked up\u201d or drugged into oblivion, and taking daily medication to sustain their mental health is not any more shameful than someone with a heart condition taking daily medication to keep their heart working properly. If you had bothered to do some research into the reality of what it\u2019s like to live with schizophrenia, or talk to your daughter\u2019s boyfriend about what it\u2019s like for him rather than just judging him and making assumptions about his stability, you would know all this.\n\n4. Not understanding what causes schizophrenia. Yes there\u2019s a genetic link to it, but having a parent with schizophrenia does not mean that a child is guaranteed or even likely to get it. Schizophrenia, like many other mental illnesses, are often caused by a combination of factors including genetics but also environmental factors like trauma or drug use. Your future grandchild is not destined for a terrible life like you seem to think they are, even if they do end up developing schizophrenia. They are actually in a better position having a parent with schizophrenia because in the event that they do develop it, they\u2019ll have grown up being aware of what the symptoms are and having open communication about mental health and will be able to seek treatment sooner than someone without those things.\n\n5. Judging your daughter for having a child out of wedlock. Welcome to 2023! Not everyone gets married to their long-term partner and not everyone gets married before having children. Pre-marital sex is no longer taboo.\n\n6. Judging your daughter for \u201cgiving up her college prospects.\u201d Maybe I\u2019m misinterpreting but she dropped out of med school, she finished college and has a bachelors degree.\n\n7. Not supporting your daughter. Even if you don\u2019t agree with the choices she\u2019s making, even if you think they\u2019re mistakes, your job as a parent is to support your child and help them through hard times, not abandon them because you don\u2019t agree with them. Your job isn\u2019t over just because she\u2019s and adult. You\u2019re failing her as a parent.\n\n8. Calling your daughter\u2019s boyfriend unstable. He was a \u201cdecent enough guy\u201d if not a little weird because he mutters to himself, until you found out he has schizophrenia, now all of a sudden he\u2019s unstable. He\u2019s not unstable, you\u2019re just a bigot.\n\n9. Claiming your daughter could\u2019ve taken what you said the wrong way and that you want the best for her. There was only one way for her to take it and if you wanted the best for her you\u2019d be supporting her in what and who makes her happy.", "YTA. My grandmother had schizophrenia. I turned out fine. Having a mental illness is not the end of the world. It doesn't make him incapable of caring for his children. You sound insufferable.", "YTA. You are EXTREMELY judgmental, classist, and ableist. You speak bad about your daughter working what you deem \u2018a low class job\u2019 and you judge this man harshly because you also deem his job beneath you. You are also judging him for his schizophrenia which something he cannot control! There is nothing wrong with needing medication to function, a lot of people do. Get off your freaking high horse and support your daughter!!", "Jesus you\u2019re an arrogant snob. YTA.", "YTA. And classist. And hate those with neurodivergence. PLEASE SEEK COUNSELING.

She done mucked up her life. And seemed to have a lot of potential / you provided her with the tools to succeed.", "Are people here insane? No! NTA! What the f\n\nIt's tough love, but you gave your daughter the honest truth. There are so many issues with this. Schizophrenia, even when medicated, is no joke", "NTA. You did the right thing.", "NTA for the truth. The daughter has made her life so much harder than it needed to be. Love is a fickle thing. It can come and go.\n\nI am not particularly interested in your views. Think what you want", "NTA - Your daughter dug a hole she was already in, now its the grand canyon. She WILL have a rather shit life if she chooses to keep the child with this man. Don't listen to reddit, its a bunch of young people that have never had the weight of being a parent on their shoulders. Sounds like she came from a good family with a lot of prospects and is downgrading so bad that her decision will haunt generations. I hope for her sake some shakes some sense into her head and she aborts or has a miscarriage.", "Nta\n\nPpl don't understand the actual problems with passing down hereditary diseases.\n\nFeelings are all good and nice,  but reality is reality.", "NTA he's got mental problems, obviously low income and without the resources to care for your daughter or your grandchild. All these people saying Y are morons.", "YTA. \n\nWhy couldn't you support or help her instead of criticise her? \n\nNot to mention, you clearly arnt educated in Scitozophrenia. I specialised in Scitozophrenia and it's not that easy. Some people are so mild it goes undiagnosed, some people are so extream medication doesn't help. This man very much seems to be on the lower end of that spectrum. Plus, Scitozophrenia isn't passed on to a child that easy. It isn't just because of genetics. It's very very very very rare to pass it on to a child but it's about 1.8% more common then a normal person getting it(0.02%)\n\nPlus, does a low end job automatically mean she can't be happy? Do you value her less as a person becuse of her job? Medicine is HARD,  majority of students drop out.", "ESH you are jsut the exact kind of person I hate. But realistically if you wanna cut your own daughter out your life over her choices go for it. As for them being the asshole they should have use protection or adopted forcing a child to be born with a serve mental illness is a dick move. (I have a birth defect before you losers come after me shit sucks)", "Op, I am a paranoid schizophrenic, with anxiety, depression and bpd. YTA, my life while it has had challenges its pretty normal, I get up go to work and be a productive member of society, I hold an 8-5 job and have a beautiful little family. You are an ableist and an asshole. Apologize to your daughter and her boyfriend before they cut you out of being able to see your beautiful grandchild that will be perfect with or without their father's mental disorder", "Wow, wow, wow. YTA.\nI wish I could give your poor daughter and her partner a hug :( I hope she cuts you off after you come crawling back hoping to see your grandchild. She deserves a better mother but unfortunately she\u2019ll have to carry the pain of having you as her mother for the rest of her life.", "You owe your kid, they don\u2019t owe you.\n\nThat\u2019s for everybody out there who has kids", "YTA. \n\nMy father was schizophrenic. With proper medication and medical care the illness is managed. Your ignorance of the illness disgusts me. \n\nMy father had 6 kids. None of us have schizophrenia, and while the illness may present itself in the future or in our future children, it also may not. Your daughter's children may or may not be diagnosed as schizophrenic. Since their parents are AWARE, they will likely receive treatment rapidly and that can determine the quality of life. \n\nYou should educate yourself in mental illness. \n\nI hope your daughter goes no contact. She deserves to live with a supportive family. Not a judgemental AH.", "NTA. \n\nYou totally went about it wrong but your concern is based on real issues. And you are very correct that love doesn\u2019t maintain a family. \n\nCompetence, capability, and most importantly, dedication are the building blocks of a strong family unit. Maybe this guy can, who knows. She has known this man less then a year and is moving in and having his child.  Does he yo-yo his meds?  How bad does he get when he is off his meds?  Is he able to maintain employment?  How reliable will he be?  This sounds like the beginning of a lifetime movie. \n\nShe is making a life altering decision for herself and her child based on a relationship with a man she has known less then 12 months.  If things go sideways she could be burdened with raising a child and supporting a man. I have 2 daughters and am a low anxiety person. I don\u2019t get rattled by much but this would keep me awake endless nights if either of them did this. \n\nI have read the comments and see a lot of people roasting you as an ism/ist. And maybe you are. But your fear for your child is very real. Do what you can to stay available and as some point fox your relationship with you daughter.", "Absolutely NTA. Your daughter will understand your logic and reasoning when her child makes the same mistakes.", "YTA\n\nAs a mother, I can understand your feelings about the choices your daughter has made...At least some of them. However that does not mean that you did the right thing by giving your adult daughter a tongue lashing. Once our children become adults and leave home, we must step back and keep the vast majority of our opinions to ourselves. Because once our children reach the age of 18, we truly have no say in what happens after that. \n\nYour daughter did not plan this pregnancy, yet she is making a responsible choice to keep, love, and care for the life she has created. You are going to be a grandmother, whether you want to or not. You have no control over this. I suggest that instead of pointing out everything that you believe your daughter has done wrong, you focus on what she has done right. Help her by being a loving support system. This doesn't mean you have to provide money. It does mean that you have to put in effort to stop being a judgemental, negative, and probable source of problems for your daughter. \n\nYour response to this hurt her deeply. That is what her boyfriend tried to tell you. I have to question how well you even know this man? Your daughter has fallen in love with him, for whatever reason. That is what matters. \n\nIf you want to be a part of your daughter's life and the life of your grandchild, I suggest that you find a way to accept this. You may find this man has some good qualities. There are people with schizophrenia who lead relatively normal lives. Not perfect ones, but who does? \n\nConsidering your reaction to this, it does not surprise me at all that your daughter is not daunted by his schizophrenia. If you behave in this fashion often, life with you must have been interesting.", "YTA. As a mental health practitioner, you are the reason people try to mask their MH struggles and avoid seeking treatment. People can maintain a healthy and comfortable life with schizophrenia and other mental health diagnoses.\n\nWhat is the value in criticizing your daughter? What is the outcome you want? Your daughter is an adult and capable of making her own decisions and determining what's best for her. If she's making her life difficult, she'll learn how to adjust. What she needs now is you're support. It's too late for criticism.", "YTA it\u2019s not your life. You\u2019re an audience member. She\u2019s the main character. I bet she\u2019d be excited for your life choices. You need therapy to understand why you respond this way. I urge you to seek this betterment of your soul if you want a fulfilling and loving relationship in the role of grandmother. You and your toxic vocal views are a more dangerous influence on an impressionable child than parents who are neurodivergent. Please seek help. You\u2019re instincts are right. You asked because your gut tells you you\u2019ve hurt someone you never meant to hurt. This shows an ability to learn and change. Seeking more help can only make you more aware of this behaviour which in turn makes it easier for you to choose to correct. You seem to lack empathy.", "Wow op, YTA in a big way.\n\nFIRST OF ALL. You really need to educate yourself on mental health. Why do I feel like you wouldn\u2019t be saying these horrible things if this poor man had epilepsy for example? Mental health is health. It\u2019s not something he inflicted upon himself due to poor decision making. You thought he was \u2018decent enough\u2019 apparently until you learned he has schizophrenia. Which, by the way, is very manageable and it sounds as if he manages absolutely fine. Making him well equipped to assist his children should they also be diagnosed.\n\nSECOND OF ALL. A medical degree is unbelievably difficult, there\u2019s an enormous amount of pressure and sadly, it doesn\u2019t end once you graduate. It\u2019s a huge career choice and I think if she was unable to handle the pressure then she made the right decision to drop out. It sounds like she got herself a job and has built a nice life for herself.\n\nYou sound so judgemental it\u2019s literally triggering. This poor couple, having to survive the difficulties of life with you around. Your attitude honestly disgusts me. Mostly for your borderline offensive and ridiculous views about mental health. You describe him as \u2018unstable\u2019 however it sounds like he is working and navigating being in a relationship, that\u2019s not unstable at all. Seriously get a grip on reality.", "Wow, you\u2019re a cold, classist, ableist asshole (I wanted to use a stronger word tbh). You have no idea what you\u2019re talking about wrt schizophrenia and you just sound awful overall.\n\nSigned, someone who\u2019s worked with hundreds of (medicated and unmedicated) PEOPLE with schizophrenia.", "Unpopular but NTA\n\n1- You sound a bit pretentious but I think you just want the best for your daughter.\n\n2- You\u2019re concerned with her well-being. It seems she threw out her career path due to pressure but realistically life is full of pressure and she can\u2019t run from it forever.\n\n3- The concern about not passing on the schizophrenia to the children is a valid concern. This is a life long issue & the children/her(mother of children) will have to deal with it\n\n4- Valid parental worries about her kid & the future.\nEdit:formatting", "NTA. If my daughter landed herself in this situation I would be disappointed and worried just like you.", "NTA. You're looking at this from a practical standpoint.", "ESAH, but your daughter started it.\n\nThe laborer thing is disappointing but not the deal breaker. The schizophrenic pregnancy out of wedlock is the big deal. \n\nReddit has a bigger heart than a brain, don't listen to them. They don't have to deal with the consequences. Literally last week they were suggesting for a couple to invite a homeless person to live with them.", "I see schizophrenia and I'm saying NTA. Maybe you said something else that would make you the AH, but that's not relevant for my comment.\n\nIt's up to your kid to ruin her own life living with that illness in the house. She's an adult and wants to ruin her existence, that's her choice.\n\nDon't ruin the rest of your life by allowing that illness near you.\n\nMove, run, cut off contact.\n\nYou did what you can to raise your kid, live you own life now.\n\nKeep that illness away from your life.", "YTA like how hard is it to support your damn daughter emotionally....? This should be a happy time in your life your about to be a grandmother. Selfish classiest asshole.", "You are a HUGE AH for the following: \n\n\"For a laborer he seemed like a decent enough guy\" - My dude, there are TONS of blue collar workers who are doing way better than people I know with advanced degrees. Many have little to no school debt or overhead for their training. Many are more than halfway to a full pension plan, with great benefits, coverages and ALL of them learned a skill that can actually be valuable beyond the office... SURE you can process reports and setup data analytics, but if you need to fix something at home, your lost. \n\n\r  \n\"pregnant out of wedlock\"  this isn't the 1920's \n\nYou are also a WHOLE AH for not even giving this guy a chance... OK, it is fair to be worried about what being involved with someone with medical issues, but how do you know that he isn't super in control of it... HELL, he has a job and was charming enough to catch your kids attention... He probably has better social skills then you. \n\nNOW LOOK.. you aren't an a$$Hol\\* for being protective over your child. You aren't wrong for wanting the best for her, but would you rather her have hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt to med school, and not be interested in that field of work? OR maybe do just enough to get a job, but hate every waking moment of life working it? \n\nAlso, you aren't wrong for being concerned about the baby, and the lifestyle that they may end up in... you know what could be helpful... SUPPORTING THE KID'S DECISION... You can worry about those things, and be a good father... You can work to get her on a \"better\" path rather then disowning her...", "YTA.  This may be difficult for you to comprehend, but it IS possible to have a happy life when you choose love over career/money.  Plenty of us \"low class\" people know that.  Just food for thought.  Continue on this course you are on, and you will find that you will 100% miss out on your grandchild's life.  Is your pride so important that you are willing to give that up?  \n\nI may not have a PhD and I may not be the highest wage earner (but I do well), but I am smart enough to know someone like you is the very last person I'd want influencing my child.  The world is too dark as it is.  Someone with an attitude as ugly as yours just makes it darker.", "I got a paragraph in and immediately decided you're a classist asshole. I am rarely wrong in my first impressions.", "YTA. The kid will be better off with a schizophrenic father than you being in their life. Hope your daughter goes no contact with you cuz I sure as hell would not allow someone like you to have any influence into my kids life.", "Fuck you. From a mentally ill person. Just fuck you.", "*cracks open beer*\n\nThis is going to me good", "YTA. \n\n>Since then she's been jumping from low class job to low class job\n\nClassist much? Every person who works is contributing to society. Your WASP Frappuccino didn't make itself. The clothes you wear didn't come from a magic clothing tree. \n\n>For a laborer\n\nAgain, **working-class**. Just as much value as a doctor or lawyer.

You think Sky Daddy just drops them from heaven straight down to earth?\n\n>with a man that needs constant medication to not be a danger to himself or the people around them \n\nSchizophrenic people, unlike 1990's and previous decades media portrayed them, are **no more likely to be a danger to others than \"neuro-norm\" people**. They are at increased risk of harming themselves, mostly because living with schizophrenia is difficult. Imagine trying to get that voice inside your head to just STFU. Or trying to cope with side-effects of your meds, constantly. Or having to constantly adjust your medication. Or dealing with insufferable people like **you**, who think those with mental illness are somehow \"less-than\" those who are \"normal\".\n\n>man who's gonna pass his mental illness to her children\n\nNot guaranteed. My mom had schizophrenia. We're talking full-on Capgras syndrome-level schizophrenia. She thought everyone close to her, including her children, was a clone. She *never* harmed us. And **none of us** (her children) have schizophrenia. And no one else passed it on to *her*. \n\nAbout 60-80% (depending on source) of persons with schizophrenia have no relatives with the condition, and while around 79% of the risk of developing schizophrenia is due to genetic factors, there is only around a **10% chance** of inheriting schizophrenia from a first-degree relative (parent), and only around a **3%** of inheriting from a more distant relative (grandparent, aunt, etc.). \n\n\n>pregnant out of wedlock\n\nIt's **2023**. No one relevant cares. Your WASP is showing, again. I got pregnant, **out-of-wedlock**, as a (*gasp*) teen back in 1999. Been happily married to the father of my children for 22 years now. \n\n>I reminded her that while love is nice, it won't solve all of the financial and medical problems her unborn kid will suffer from cause of her poor life decisions\n\nWell aren't **you** just a ray of sunshine! Having money doesn't **guarantee** a healthy child. Having money doesn't mean there are no financial problems. And having **no** money doesn't mean that you're doomed to have sick children and financial struggles *forever*. For fuck's sake, the most financially responsible people I know are **not** well-off. They have to carefully budget *every* penny. Therefore, they are very careful with spending. \n\n>Today I received a message from my daughter's boyfriend (my daughter hasn't contacted me after our fight) where he told me that I'm a psychopathic monster for making my daughter cry for 2 days straight and to go to hell.\n\nHe's right.

High stress low wage job. Young. Girlfriend also low wage. They deserve to be a person, sure. Given their current situation, I really don't think they're in a good place to be a parent.\nThey both don't have the money to raise a child that doesn't come at the expense of others.\n\nNTA.

We are supposed to be there to support and help them through the ups and especially the downs. Your daughter needs the support of her mother through a scary/exciting time of her life and probably feels berated and abandoned by you. The boyfriend is reacting to seeing his pregnant girlfriend crying for 2 days so don't be too harsh about his text. Clearly you need to have a conversation with your daughter and potentially her boyfriend, apologise for your comments as you were wrong for what you've said.

When we talk about crew, we are talking about people like camera crews, gaffers, sound technicians, etc. Most crew members in these behind the camera roles don't get residuals from ticket or video sales at all traditionally, their pay is part of the production budget and they are paid before the final product is even finished.", ">Isn't that part of the strike? That the people who work on the shows should get residuals from streaming services?\n\nThat writers and actors (the 2 groups striking) should get residuals from the streaming services...", "You are right.  That's the problem.  It's how you approach the situation.  You have to say things in a way that the daughter will think about them but not in a way where she feels this overwhelming disappointment from you and judgment.  Once she was pregnant and decided to keep her child,  there should be nothing but support and happiness for her and a grandma that is excited to help and be a part if her grandchildren life.", "Yeah I have epilepsy, pcos and autism and am the only one in my family to have any of them lol\n\nIt works the other way too sadly. People who have no illnesses at all can have kids who get them. While I could have kids (even though i probably won't) who would never have any of my issues!", "Love that you pointed this out! So many people with schizophrenia are able to lead perfectly normal and successful live through therapy and treatment. In fact one of the leading researchers on schizophrenia that I learned about in my psych course during uni was in fact herself schizophrenic! Really wish the stigma around schizophrenia wasn't still so prevalent.", "It\u2019s actually .4% according to WHO so it\u2019s much less than 5-10%", "A 10% risk increase means 10% of the original number, not 10% to base.\n\nIf the initial percentage is 1%, a 10% risk increase means that the new number is 1.1%.", "This is so WILD considering how freaking popular crime shows and docu-series are. I binge watch the hell out of so many of these on the streaming sites.\n\nI also love documentaries since I was young. I definitely wrongfully assumed that given the popularity that you would see something from the successes.\n\nThis bloody sucks.\n\nHow can the average person support?", "I had no idea those in \"unscripted\" shows were all non-union. That is some bullshit.\n\nAnd here I was thinking it was only the \"actors\" on unscripted shows who are underpaid and therefore considered preferable because they can make shows cheaper.\n\nI didn't realize it was across the board to crew and writer positions.\n\nWriting is the same hard work in either case so wtf.\n\nI'm sorry you are treated this way.", "This made me so sad to read. Unions should be clamoring to take people under their umbrella, not leaving them to fend for themselves.", "I think the case could be made that EVERYONE should get some kind of residuals, but that is unlikely to happen.", "Only the writers and actors are on strike but crew members (IATSE) are also not working because\u2026well what are we gonna do without scripts or actors? \n\nI believe depending on which contract you\u2019re under, residuals are used to fund our health care plan but they aren\u2019t paid out to crew members directly.", "My brother is schizophrenic so I have a pretty deep connection with the issue and it\u2019s true with medication and therapy you literally never would suspect him of being schizophrenic he has his own place, pays his bills, leases a car, has a job he\u2019s worked for two years now, and though he struggles with things like cleaning or keeping a girlfriend he\u2019s doing well and is content. Without meds he can be dangerous and scary but he just gets a monthly shot and is good to go for the next month. It can be expensive as hell and should be free but it is possible for a schizophrenic person to get help and live normal lives.", "I would assume that\u2019s worldwide, not just the US, if it\u2019s from WHO.", "Oh derp you\u2019re right. Thanks! My brain isn\u2019t quite working today it seems.", "Nope. We do all the work and the network execs get alllllll the cash. But we can't make shows without the network's money, so we can't do anything. It's fucked.\n\nSuccess doesn't matter. People at the bottom will always be screwed, even if a show makes a bunch of money and wins Emmys.\n\nYou know whats even worse? Story producers put together the episodes, and they use an editing software to do it. They should be in the editor's union because of that, but they're not. A Hollywood Reporter article a few years ago quoted a source saying bosses told the story producers to go to lunch because union reps were coming, and they didn't want them to see them using the editing software.\n\nI worked on the first season of a show last year and was the only associate producer because the production company was too cheap to hire another. I did ALL the research and wrote ALL the episode outlines. I still get paid less than everyone else. It was hard being the only AP, but I made it work.\n\nThe showrunner wanted me back for the 2nd season, but the production company made him hire the production co's president's assistant because she \"wanted to get into production\". It was and is still devastating.\n\nThe whole industry, including unscripted, is slow right now, and I haven't worked in five months, which is by far the longest I've been unemployed the entire four years I've been doing this, as showrunners tend to bring me onto their next show. I have been battling a serious medical condition the last few months, so my medical bills are high, and I have no income except for unemployment right now. It's scary.\n\nI'm not sure what the public can do, to be honest, but I can't tell you how much I appreciate you asking. Seriously. It means a lot to even see someone say that.\n\nIf anyone reading this knows anyone who needs an experienced true crime associate producer who comes with a lot of great references from well-respected showrunners, please message me!\n\n(Sorry for the literal novel. Guess I needed to get some of that frustration out. Thank you to anyone who reads this.)", "I strictly work on documentary shows so I can only really speak on those.\n\nI do extensive researching and writing. I look at 100s of pages of court records  and police files to make sure the info is accurate and then write the story with that info. I find the cases. I call detectives and victims' family members and ask them if they want to participate. I do pre-interviews with them. I write interview questions.\n\nAnd I get paid the least of any crew member, except the PA.\n\nLast year, I worked on the first season of a show and was the only associate producer because they were too cheap to hire another. I did all the researching and writing. I wrote every single episode outline. \n\nThe reason they were able to have one AP is because someone with experience did it (me). The showrunner wanted me back on the 2nd season but the production company made him hire the president of the production co's assistant because she \"wanted to get into production\".\n\nThe industry is slow right now, so I haven't worked in five months. And I usually get a lot of work because people I work with bring me onto other shows. I work so hard and every showrunner loves me, but this time, that didn't matter. Because someone without experience but had connections wanted it.\n\nI'm also battling a medical thing and I don't have insurance through work, so my bills are high. It's been so hard.\n\nI appreciate your kind words, thank you <3\n\nSorry for the complaining. I guess I needed to vent.\n\nIf anyone reading this needs an experienced true crime AP who comes with great references from well-respected showrunners, please message me.", "I agree", "Thank you for clarifying and adding on! I took film classes in college but I don't work in the industry, so I'm grateful to get better info from someone who knows a lot more. I know just about everyone in the industry is heavily affected, with the possible exception to the reality tv folks and smaller self-distributed folks, like Youtubers. I did not know that about residuals going the union health care fund, that's actually pretty cool and a great idea. Mind if I ask if that is working well for you guys?"]}
