Fast.\n\nNTA", "NTA - It's not a real relationship without trust. Sounds like there may be some projection on his part, which would explain his defensiveness over **you** seeing **his** phone.", "NTA\n\nHe doesn't have a right to your phone.  It's super unhealthy for him to do this.  He's not your Dad.  He has no right to do this.  Do not hand it to him.  Ever.  Lock it.  He is a controlling buttwipe.", "Get the hell out of there! NTA", "Big NTA.  \n\nYou have a very serious problem OP, and it's not phones.  It's trust.  \n\nRight now the situation is your fiance feels the need and the right to *go through your shit* whenever he feels like it, for as long as he feels like.  He feels entitled to all your personal data.  \n\nBut it's hypocritical.  It's a red flag for HIM that he can't look at your phone whenever he wants for however long he wants, but you're supposed to be okay with not getting access to his phone.  \n\nI would question what else in the relationship is authoritarian, unbalanced, unequal?  Where else are your rights or needs being ignored in favor of his?  \n\nFor me personally- the way he's acting would be a deal killer for the whole relationship.  My phone is my business, it's like a journal, you don't have any right to read it.  If you don't trust that I'm with you and you alone, if you need to take 20+ minutes to root through my private communications to make yourself feel better, then we shouldn't be engaged.  And if you think it's okay to have full access to my phone when I have no access to yours, that's also not okay.  \n\nOP- at bare minimum I'd suggest start locking your phone and tell him that he can look through your phone for exactly as long as he's willing to let you look through his.  \nI'd more so suggest reconsider your relationship and make sure you're not wearing rose colored glasses.", "Date someone else", "NTA. He has no right to tell you when you can and cannot have your own phone, especially if he doesn\u2019t pay your phone bill.", "NTA \\~ He is disrespecting your boundries by just grabbing the phone from you, its not healthy to do so, neither to control and check upon you. Red flags, run while you can, you are not yet married. He does this knowing you feel uncomfortable and have bad expierence(s) in the past.", "NTA. This is a huge red flag.  Controlling another's phone is one of the hallmarks of an abusive relationship  Lock your phone and refuse to give him the PW. He'll make your life hell or break up with you.   Or save yourself the grief and dump him now.  If you feel you can't leave him for emotional or economic reasons, plan NOW for how to do that. \n\nMany many people will tell you this was a sign they should not have ignored. You'll have a hard time finding anyone who will tell you this behavior is okay and the relationship is otherwise wonderful, except for an abuser.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nMy ex-boyfriend used to do this all the time. He would even go as far as texting contacts pretending to be me to see if I was \"up to something.\" He deleted pictures he did not think I should have, and if I ever mentioned that I was getting uncomfortable he would say that I was obviously hiding something. He held onto his phone tightly. He slept with it in his pocket, and took it with him everywhere he went. If I asked to go through it, a screaming match ensued. What I came to find out is this man was talking to anyone who gave him the time of day. He was doing all the things he was afraid that I was doing. I will urge you to leave because these behaviors only get worse over time, and my guess is these are not the only controlling behaviors he exhibits.", "What the fuck? NTA. this is so weird and controlling, stop giving him your phone.", "Oh hell no! He\u2019s the one giving off red flags, not you. I truly don\u2019t understand peoples\u2019 fascinations with looking through their partners\u2019 phones like this. It\u2019s invasive and gives off a message saying that they don\u2019t trust each other. NTA to the extreme. Break the marriage off and lock up your phone.

NTA but he\u2019s abusing you and does not have some sort of \u201cright\u201d to see your phone. That\u2019s not how a healthy relationship works.", "You are in a bad relationship. Your fianc\u00e9 is not only an asshole, he is a controlling, manipulative, and very concerning asshole. Do not marry this man. Do not even continue to date him.", "He sounds very jealous, which is a usually unfixable problem which will get worse with time. Plus, one rule for you and a different rule for him? Screw that. \n\nIf you stay with him you could end up in a full-on controlling relationship. You are NTA but I'd dump him.", "NTA. Please don\u2019t marry this man.

You're fiance is most likely cheating, but is hoping to find something on your phone so he can make you look like the bad guy. I'd seriously reconsider marrying this guy", "NTA. It is a major red flag. Against him. Why should he be allowed your phone but you\u2019re not allowed his? Also I\u2019ve never understood this need to check the other person\u2019s phone. You either trust someone or you don\u2019t. And if you don\u2019t then the relationship can\u2019t really continue on a healthy way.", "Lock your phone. He does not have this right.

A relationship is not a game of UNO. Who tf makes up rules like that? Healthy relationships have boundaries, and they apply to everyone in it. It\u2019s okay if y\u2019all want to be open to seeing each other\u2019s phone, but it needs to be something you are BOTH okay with. Personally, i believe you\u2019re allowed a measure of privacy even in relationship.
