When I ask him to give me my phone back, he refuses and continues to look through my messages and photos. I have nothing to hide, but it looks like he really wants to find something. \nToday I got back from work, and he asked for my phone. I gave it, and for 20 minutes he was going through my phone. Usually he doesn\u2019t let me see what he does either. I wanted to take a shower, so asked my phone back. He said I could take a shower without my phone, I said no because I wanted to listen to a podcast. I grabbed my phone out of his hands, and he said that it was a major red flag that he can\u2019t look at my phone whenever he wants. \nWhenever I ask for his phone, he just simply says no, and doesn\u2019t give it to me. His argument is that I \u201ccan\u2019t use a uno reverse card\u201d and that I \u201cwant to go through his phone because he does\u201d. \nNow we\u2019re mat at each other. \nI\u2019m really sorry for my English, not my first language. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: a lot of you are asking why I\u2019m still with him.

Overall our relationship and communication is good, he treats me well. On this subject we just don\u2019t get along. \n\nBut I\u2019m considering to continue this relationship, because I found out he has been deleting messages from his phone (which my intuition is telling me he\u2019s hiding things from me)", "created_utc": 1682701039, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1321vul/aita_for_not_giving_my_phone/", "score": 166, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He feels entitled to all your personal data.  \n\nBut it's hypocritical.  It's a red flag for HIM that he can't look at your phone whenever he wants for however long he wants, but you're supposed to be okay with not getting access to his phone.  \n\nI would question what else in the relationship is authoritarian, unbalanced, unequal?  Where else are your rights or needs being ignored in favor of his?  \n\nFor me personally- the way he's acting would be a deal killer for the whole relationship.  My phone is my business, it's like a journal, you don't have any right to read it.  If you don't trust that I'm with you and you alone, if you need to take 20+ minutes to root through my private communications to make yourself feel better, then we shouldn't be engaged.  And if you think it's okay to have full access to my phone when I have no access to yours, that's also not okay.  \n\nOP- at bare minimum I'd suggest start locking your phone and tell him that he can look through your phone for exactly as long as he's willing to let you look through his.  \nI'd more so suggest reconsider your relationship and make sure you're not wearing rose colored glasses.", "Date someone else", "[deleted]", "NTA \\~ He is disrespecting your boundries by just grabbing the phone from you, its not healthy to do so, neither to control and check upon you.

He would even go as far as texting contacts pretending to be me to see if I was \"up to something.\" He deleted pictures he did not think I should have, and if I ever mentioned that I was getting uncomfortable he would say that I was obviously hiding something. He held onto his phone tightly. He slept with it in his pocket, and took it with him everywhere he went. If I asked to go through it, a screaming match ensued.
