Kitchen utensils were always the cheapest of the cheap and treated as such by everyone. People were students so it makes sense that they didn't know how to treat stuff.\n\nSince Covid I've been living with 3 completely new people in my apartment, all aged around 30. The biggest issue I've faced with them is how they treat kitchenware. They put wooden cutting boards in the dishwasher or leave them in standing water, destroying them (glue comes apart, major warping), they don't sharpen knives and put them tip down into the drying rack and use metal utensils in our non-stick pans despite me having asked them not to and putting cold water in them when they're still hot, warping them. They've destroyed some of my personal pans that way and haven't replaced them. They just keep using the really fucked up pans.\n\nI've recently started keeping a few items (some knives, wooden cutting board and non-stick pans) in my room. I've noticed some mean looks from one of my roommates when we were food prepping at the same time and he was struggling to cut something with a dull knife and I didn't offer him my personal, sharp knife. Our pans have also gotten so bad that I just ordered a new stainless steel pan. Stainless steel is a bit more forgiving, but still needs proper care and use to maintain which I know they won't adhere to. I'm planning on keeping this one to myself to, especially since it's the most expensive pan that I've owned.

It feels really skeevy and sneaky to be hiding things such as pans. But if they can't respect your things, there's nothing else to do except keep them to yourself. I was in a similar predicament. It's bewildering. You would think they were deep frying caramel in the pans, the way they would end up. So I strongly back you up.

Replacing them is what they should have done (and learned how to be respectful of other people's things).

I bought myself a nice ($90) chef's knife a while back and also received a really nice 3pc pan set as a birthday gift. I told both my roomies that they are not allowed to use either of them unless they do so with care and I explained what I meant by that (no metal utensils, no dishwasher, no leaving them in the sink or the drying rack). Basically use them, wash them immediately, and put them away. They both declined and said they don't want to be responsible for fucking them up so they just won't use them, cool with me.

But be prepared for the social consequences that will follow.\n\nYeah, that's what I'm mostly worried about. Previously we had a huge fight because they all thought I didn't do much when it came to cleaning/buying supplies/taking care of the apartment until we started using an app to track what people did and they could see I was actually doing the most (I just don't tell anyone loudly because I just expect it's normal to do those things).
