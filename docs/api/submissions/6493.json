Kitchen utensils were always the cheapest of the cheap and treated as such by everyone. People were students so it makes sense that they didn't know how to treat stuff.\n\nSince Covid I've been living with 3 completely new people in my apartment, all aged around 30. The biggest issue I've faced with them is how they treat kitchenware. They put wooden cutting boards in the dishwasher or leave them in standing water, destroying them (glue comes apart, major warping), they don't sharpen knives and put them tip down into the drying rack and use metal utensils in our non-stick pans despite me having asked them not to and putting cold water in them when they're still hot, warping them. They've destroyed some of my personal pans that way and haven't replaced them. They just keep using the really fucked up pans.\n\nI've recently started keeping a few items (some knives, wooden cutting board and non-stick pans) in my room. I've noticed some mean looks from one of my roommates when we were food prepping at the same time and he was struggling to cut something with a dull knife and I didn't offer him my personal, sharp knife. Our pans have also gotten so bad that I just ordered a new stainless steel pan. Stainless steel is a bit more forgiving, but still needs proper care and use to maintain which I know they won't adhere to. I'm planning on keeping this one to myself to, especially since it's the most expensive pan that I've owned. I know for certain that this will piss some people off in my flat because they're not too happy with our current pans either and they're all about sharing stuff.\n\n\nWIBTA if I keep this to myself, and AITA for not sharing my stuff in the first place?", "created_utc": 1672845093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1035xw7/aita_for_keeping_my_cookware_to_myself_in_a/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's a no-brainer to me. \nBut if they don't know how to care for these things properly, perhaps you can show them and explain to them why you do and should. If they continue to be careless, they'll soon find out why you don't use dull knives \ud83d\ude39\n\nI am a prep cook for a living. Most of the cooks here mangle their knives, and then wonder why they don't work. I don't let anyone use my tools, except the owner, who's been in the food industry longer than I've been around. How respect (and finesse) go a long way.", "NTA but the way I dealt with the sort of thing in the past was to put out decoys. If I was getting myself something new that would get ruined or disappear in the communal space, I\u2019d pick up a new cheap alternative from Walmart or a second hand store and put it in the communal space, while keeping my valuables separate. That way I wasn\u2019t selfish in their eyes and they only destroyed $5-10 worth of my purchases but couldn\u2019t complain since it was a gift.", "NTA \n\nThey're not your friends or relatives. You don't have to share anything with them. They're lucky you let them use any of your utensils at all. This is a flatshare, not a commune, and they're not entitled to anything you have or use. So what if they give you mean looks?\n\nIf you damaged something of theirs they'd probably raise holy hell about it and all their talk about sharing would go out the window. You've asked them to be more careful with your things and they haven't listened to you, so keep your valuable utensils to yourself and don't worry about them. \n\nI suspect they only insist on share and share alike because they don't want to spend money buying stuff when yours has been available for them to ruin. And frankly, if these people are in their thirties, they should know better than to take other people's stuff for granted and not treat items they're borrowing with basic respect. They sound immature.", "Well you\u2019re NTA because if you didn\u2019t buy the new stuff, they\u2019d still be using that old stuff anyway right? So really what\u2019s the difference? Just you buying new stuff and not sharing which you aren\u2019t obligated to do, if you bought a new shirt you wouldn\u2019t be expected to let everyone wear it. If you\u2019re cool with keeping pans and stuff in your room then have at it. I personally wouldn\u2019t care that much to keep kitchen stuff in my bedroom taking up space and I\u2019m pretty forgiving with roommate stuff. But NTA you can do whatever you want with your personal items, you just might have roommates that think you\u2019re uptight", "WNBTA, people who don't respect your property do not deserve to use it.", "NTA\n\nYou purchased those items, so they are yours. That's the rule of thumb. Not to mention that good quality kitchen utensils are rather pricey. It's stupid of them to want to use your good ones just to ruin them and expect you to buy replacements. \n\n\nI know where you're coming from OP. It feels really skeevy and sneaky to be hiding things such as pans. But if they can't respect your things, there's nothing else to do except keep them to yourself. I was in a similar predicament. It's bewildering. You would think they were deep frying caramel in the pans, the way they would end up. So I strongly back you up. Storing the items in your bedroom is perfectly fine and the best route to go down.", "Do they know any different? Do they understand how to care for items?", "NTA.\n\nIf they keep ruining your cookware, then they can use the stuff they ruined. I wouldn't trust them with my cookware, either.", "NTA\n\nto your judgement they've mistreated the items you made available to the group. Even if they're totally fine, they were YOURS, and they misused them according to how YOU thought they should be used. Replacing them is what they should have done (and learned how to be respectful of other people's things). And you replacing some items and keeping them away from them is a perfectly reasonable thing to do given their past behavior.", "NTA. I lived with two roommates earlier this year. I bought myself a nice ($90) chef's knife a while back and also received a really nice 3pc pan set as a birthday gift. I told both my roomies that they are not allowed to use either of them unless they do so with care and I explained what I meant by that (no metal utensils, no dishwasher, no leaving them in the sink or the drying rack). Basically use them, wash them immediately, and put them away. They both declined and said they don't want to be responsible for fucking them up so they just won't use them, cool with me. That's how that should work. If they can't respect your things, which they've already proven they can't, then they don't get to use them. It's that simple.", "NTA.

It's not like you even took things they were using; you just got new things and kept for your own use.

I had to learn the hard way with that and I completely agree with you that doing that is a very good idea. I\u2019ve only ever lived with roommates once, and it was an absolute nightmare! \n\nThey would take days to clean the dishes and treated the house like shit. \n\nSince there wasn\u2019t really enough cookware to go around, I decided to buy my own and keep it in the pantry. I should\u2019ve kept it in my room!\n\nOne day, one of my roommates was looking for my small cookie sheet, and when he couldn\u2019t find it, he accused me of stealing \u201chis\u201d cookie sheet. So stupid! \n\nIt had to be explained to him that they only had one large cookie sheet and the smaller one was the one I purchased. Had I kept all the cookware that I purchased in my room this probably wouldn\u2019t have happened. \n\nSo my advice is that you keep doing that to keep the peace between yourself and your roommates!", "Wow, this has to be the easiest NTA ever.

One knows how to cook but doesn't know how to take care of things, especially non-stick and wood. \n\nOf those that can't really cook, one is trying to improve and still does fuck up from time to time, I often let her use stuff I don't care about too much but with the others it feels like I'm always playing a game of hiding my stuff, which just feels bad in communal space :/", "> NTA. But be prepared for the social consequences that will follow.\n\nYeah, that's what I'm mostly worried about. Previously we had a huge fight because they all thought I didn't do much when it came to cleaning/buying supplies/taking care of the apartment until we started using an app to track what people did and they could see I was actually doing the most (I just don't tell anyone loudly because I just expect it's normal to do those things). So the mood is improving, but I'm feeling like this might shift things again..", "Yeah, I've explained it in the past before, and they said they'd respect it and not do it only for me to catch them doing it not much later. Especially the stuff with pans is annoying because it has destroyed everything to the point that I don't enjoy cooking anymore. I know not everyone was raised with knowledge on how to treat stuff and one of my roommates does try her best, but the others just disregard it.", "Then maybe show them how to care for them?", "What app are you guys using? I\u2019m having the exact same problems with my current roommates.", "That's super frustrating and just blatant disrespect. I'm sorry.", "> Then maybe show them how to care for them?\n\nTrust me, I have many times. At some point it just gave me anxiety to address it again because it just seems like I'm being annoying by pointing it out whilst they're cooking. If I told you: \"please don't use any metal utensils in the non-stick pans; no forks, spoons, metal spatulas or whisks even if you say you won't touch the pans.\" would that be a rude way of saying it? because that's how I've said it so far.", "> What app are you guys using? I\u2019m having the exact same problems with my current roommates.\n\nIt's called Flatastic, but I don't know if it's just a German app or if it's international."]}
