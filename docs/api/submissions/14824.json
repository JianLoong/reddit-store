Otherwise, you may build resentment. It also helps you to recognize your dependencies and build healthy boundaries about where you invest validations.\n- Sharing the sensitive information is a big no-no. That\u2019s a trust breaker and I\u2019d be upset too. That said\u2026 (and you\u2019re NTA on this point, just advice), safely assume close partners share everything with each other.
