It also helps you to recognize your dependencies and build healthy boundaries about where you invest validations.\n- Sharing the sensitive information is a big no-no.

I had a friend react like you when I had my first serious relationship and it was very hurtful and felt very controlling. You sound extremely jealous that you were not the only person your friend wanted to hang out with, and quite frankly, as you start getting older, you do spend more time with your significant other than your friends. It was likely your behavior that strained your relationship. Your friend is weird for sending an invitation though.", "NTA - who sends a wedding invitation via text? If she really wanted you there, you wouldn't have received what seems like a last minute invite which was most likely because, well, more gifts.\nYour friendship had clearly ended by this point and imo I would have done the same thing and simply just ignored the 'invite'", "If I read this right, you received an invitation via text, but within three days you were blocked because you didn\u2019t respond right away.  Since when does anyone have to respond to any invitation within 48 hours????  Are we not allowed to check our calendars and schedules with other people?  WTF????\n\nNTA.  Move on.  They are both way too high-maintenance.", "NTA\n\nBlock them back on everything. You don't need the drama", "Got my last wedding invitation via text. No problem for me there.\n\nThe entire situation sounds super immature though.

The invitation wasn\u2019t even directly from him, it was from Raja.", "You drifted away and then you kind of drifted back toward Raja? She's replaced you as a priority. Sorry. But, it definitely happens. NAH. you guys aren't pals anymore.", "YTA\n\nYou being butthurt about your friend moving on doesn't excuse you from basic civility.", "NTA. Who sends a text invite to a wedding?", "NTA\n\nSounds like you mutually ended the relationship. Just ignore it like the invite and move on with your life again.\n\nTyler is probably an ass but it does sound like you are kinda clingy. When people find a mate they often put everything into that relationship for awhile. It\u2019s just how it works.\n\nAlso: if you have something you don\u2019t want anyone to know, don\u2019t tell anyone except a therapist. I tell my kids \u201cassume anything you tell anyone will eventually be known by everybody.

The only thing you should have done was block her and tyler from your phone ages ago and if not back then, def right after getting that text.  They should have been blocked on all socials and socials locked down as private for the time being.  \n\nYou owe them nothing.  She couldn\u2019t even be bothered to text you to get your address so she could send you a proper invite?  \n\nNothing of value lost here. As others have said it was likely a gift grab.  That or you weren\u2019t the only one to say NOPE! Hence why it was via text.

Sometimes things break and cannot be put back together again, and we have to accept that.

I know how it feels to think highly of your close friend just for them to turn around and treat you like shit when someone new comes along.

It's certainly a gift grab. Don't respond, don't engage. Move on.\n\nNTA", "Yes, I was thinking the same, though I wondered what the actual invitation said for dates. Like, is it next weekend? People are getting real casual anymore or green.\n\nAlso, if anyone sends invites with an RSVP, they should expect to do some legwork to follow-up with people. If you don't, expect a lot of unexpected guests I suppose...", "Everything you have said is bullshit. And tossing out a ton of important information is just fucking ignorant.
