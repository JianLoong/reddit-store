I think OP makes it clear this was about a friendship. Maybe I'm wrong but she used the word befriended...\n\nAnyhow, OP you are young. Raja is too. Her getting married now may not even work out but what I will say is if Raja is the person you think she is, you will hear from her down the road when she wisens up to the way she has been acting and misses a genuine friend. This has literally happened to a couple friends of mine and me. Otherwise, Raja is not the person you believe she is, you're better off without her and the relationship has run its course.\n\nAs someone who has planned a wedding, it's annoying AF and rude when people don't respond to an RSVP. Maby people do it, however. Though I agree with you, if it was truly an olive branch or she wanted to know, she would have reached out personally.
