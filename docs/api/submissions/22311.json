I've always had a fish tank all of my life, but reef aquariums specifically since then.\n\nThings have got more expensive this year and energy bills especially in the UK are a problem, our bills have gone from \u00a3110/month to \u00a3240/month. I would estimate that my fish tank is 35% of our energy use, I totally concede this. There are also other costs like salt, food, chemicals and other bits as well. Total cost for the fish tank is probably \u00a3120/month\n\n\u00a380 in energy alone to run a fish tank is a lot, but this is a hobby I've had for a long time and not only that but I've got sentimental fish and coral that she just doesn't seem to understand. A lot of the coral came from my fathers tank, he died last year. My clownfish I've had for 12 years. Several fish are not available anymore either due to collection bans and I've got a group of shrimp in there that breed which is pretty much unheard of really.\n\nI've done my best to cut costs, I've switched to DIY chemicals for dosing instead of name brand stuff, I've changed my food to cheaper options, I've not bought a fish or coral for well over a year, I even sell bits of coral when they grow too much to local friends to help offset costs for some of the maintenance.\n\nTo me the tank is a hobby, it helps me relax and some of the things in there mean a lot to me due to them coming from my dads tank from when I was a kid. It's a lot of work, it's not cheap, sometimes I flood the floor slightly (she's very understanding over this)... But I really like it. \n\nShe see's the tank as a \u00a31400+ a year expense where we could go on holiday instead or put the money into savings and do better things together without the fish tank. I see this, I just don't value a holiday that will relax me for 2 weeks over a fish tank that relaxes me all the time.\n\nWe are comfortable, we are not struggling financially but we are not rich either. If we were struggling the tank would go, no question... For context we spend more in the pub or on food delivery apps than I do on my fish tank. She's spent more in shoes last year than I did on my fish tank. I just don't think she likes the fish tank or understands it, I have tried explaining...\n\nShe did suggest a compromise of replacing it with a smaller tank, but this would still mean getting rid of some of the fish and even buying lots of new equipment which would mean the savings would take years to take effect anyway.\n\nAm I in the wrong for wanting to keep my fish tank? I feel like the value it brings to my life is well worth the expense but am I just insane or biased towards it?

I had a fish tank for years with a bunch of cool things that always grabbed people\u2019s attention (crabs/crayfish)\n\nI ended up getting rid of it because maintenance got cumbersome and just got tired of maintaining it. \n\nAlways wanted a salt water tank. Just bring up the fact that money isn\u2019t tight and that it\u2019s something you thoroughly enjoy doing throughout the year, and if you want to go on holiday we can start cutting cost on materialistic things such as going out and shopping.", "NTA Try putting it to her this way: 'Are you willing to give up X if I give up the tank? Why not?' She does things that don't directly benefit you I'm sure. If you can get her to see that her shoes budget is equivalent to your fish budget and for the same reasons (it makes you both happy but it's not really needed), the conflict might ease. If not, maybe just designate fun money for you both that you can spend without justification and use your money for the fish.\n\nAlso, if there are things she wants to do, then great! Sit down with a budget and figure out how you \\*both\\* can cut back and work towards those goals. But don't forget to budget for fun stuff for you both throughout the year.", "NTA\u2014I you had the fish tank, went golfing, scuba diving, among other expensive hobbies then I could see her point.

Keep it", "Nta. You wouldn't just get rid of a dog or a cat so nonchalantly.", "NTA. But it may come to a \"me or the fish tank\" moment. Which will you choose then?", "NTA- you had the fish before she was in your life she knew it was part of the package. I know these types of setups take a lot of time to take care of, she might just be jealous you\u2019re spending so much time with the fish and not her", "NTA if you've been doing this since you were 14 it's clearly a high value part of your life and identity, not a light pastime. I'm a total stranger yet even I can hear that.\n\nWould be different maybe if you were having to choose between having the tank and feeding your children or something but as long as it's not interfering with survival it seems like you should be able to prioritize what matters most to you.", "As a reefer, keep the tank, get rid of the GF. If she spends more on shoes but can't understand your hobby that involves living animals? Come on. NTA", "NTA but she is u had them for years and some of the stuff came from ur dad that u lost. U don't ask people to give up things or animals that came from dead parents that's just mean and insensitive. I have the social skills of a stick and I know that", "NTA\n\n\nThere are other expenses you can skim before the tank (pun intended!)", "I do agree on the fish front, they are seen as disposable. Very sad.\n\nBut on the coral front, these animals are immortal.

Or do you pay that yourself?", "I don\u2019t believe your relationship is doomed, but I don\u2019t believe this is a minor issue.

No. Straight up no", "What percentage of the electricity bill do you pay?", "NTA \n\n> She\u2019s spent more in shoes last year than I did on my fish tank\n\nAnd this line sealed the deal. It actually miffed me because, unless she has a shoe hobby, how can she even have the audacity to ask you to give up on something that has sentimental value and holds so much meaning for you?\n\nAlso why don\u2019t you guys just split finances? You can use your own money on maintaining the tank. And if possible (and only if you are comfortable) we would all love to see a picture!", "NTA.

What's the actual problem?  Did you try asking your partner why she's unhappy?", "Nta. As a fellow aquarist what you have there sounds like a true work of art and love, and that deserves a lot of respect, would she ask you to stop painting? Stop biking? Give up your dog? Throw away a plant collection? I feel like aquarium keeping is just as important as these things in or lives. \n\n\nWow I would die to see a setup that's breeding saltwater shrimp. Shrimp tax!!!!", "\"I do pay for all of the fish stuff, and I've offered to pay the entire energy bill. She said no..\"\n\nenough said! tell her to sheet in a hat and pull it over here ears. If you offered to pay, she said no, then this is just a power struggle....what will be next, your best friend, family?", "You haven't been here very long, people tell their partners to get rid of their dogs or cats all the time. Usually, wrongly, and the wronged party is promptly told to break up with that partner.\n\nI don't usually (sincerely) advise a tit-for-tat attitude but a budget/spending review might be a revelation in this relationship.\n\nAs for fish specifically as pets, they have personalities which makes their behaviours entertaining for their owners. Maybe they don't love the way a dog does, or even the way a cat does, but there are enough studies to prove that watching and caring for fish is incredibly good for people's mental health and blood pressure.", "Having something that relaxes you is nothing to belittle or dismiss.", "Second the picture!", "Because it would be insane if someone had a shoe hobby.  INSANITY!!! There is definitely not an entire industry that sells shoes and only shoes and those shoes can be collected like a fat virgin collects Pokeman cards.\n\nFish: normal.\n\nShoes: INSANE\n\nBut yes, they should split finances.", "Comparing costs to a dog. I spend about $100/mo on my dog's food. $480 a year on grooming. About $600 on boarding if we go on vacation. And since Jan. 1 we also spent $1,100 on vet visits, procedures, and meds. That's $3,380 I could have spent on vacations. Or shoes...\n\nOh my god, did I just decide to give my dog away?!?!!!\n\nThis isn't where I expected this comment to go :(", "Maybe she would feel better about it if you make a point of paying for all fish related items before splitting bills 50/50.", "I think you should offer to pay more of the energy bill. You're only estimating the percentage of the cost at 35%, when it could be more. I don't think you're an asshole for wanting to keep your tank when you're struggling, but it might make her feel better if you pay more of the bill.", "I am not sure if your comment is sarcasm or not but it sure is entertaining lmao", "Nah, just a week or 2 of noodles when it is needed like the rest of us plebs with there furry bro's  :) \n\n( looks at a 500 euro vet bill for a bunny ) ... yes, i am fully aware that a \"new\" one is maybe 10 euro .. but that is not the point ;p\n\n\n\nI look at it this way, i am convinced that the hairy posse here in food and care is still one hell of a lot cheaper then the army of shrinks i would need without them.", "I spent about 4200 on my cat per year and sure it would be nice to have that money but I'd rather have my cat.  An animal that loves you is priceless.", "I do pay for all of the fish stuff, and I've offered to pay the entire energy bill. She said no... I make a sure that every month I'm spending \u00a340 (more most of the time) taking her out. We went out on Thursday to the theatre, I spent \u00a390 on tickets she spent \u00a330 on drinks. She's aware I'm doing this to make up for the energy bill and is fine with it.\n\nHer point is literally \"why spend \u00a31400 on a fish tank when we could go somewhere and make memories\"... I'm not convinced it's even about the money, as I said we spent more elsewhere and it's never brought up.\n\nWe have definitely cut some stuff out due to rent increases, utilities increasing and bonuses not being received that I would normally get but we're not struggling.", "We sorted that a long time ago, she's happy with the split. I've offered to pay the entire energy bill and she's always said no but I make a point of making sure I make it up to here on nights out of whatever.", "This is a very serious relationship problem.  It doesn't even matter if it's fish or shoes.  They don't respect one another's hobbies.", "Yeah, it\u2019s quite distressful how she views this as nothing more than an expense. And it\u2019s not just a hobby, it\u2019s living breathing animals. People with aquariums find a deep sense of calm,  purpose and joy in caring for the fish and the other aquatic life.", "NTA.\n\nDon't get rid of your tank, but you need to pay more of the energy bill to cover it.", "Info, how are finances handled in your family? If you have partially or fully separated finances, you can absolutely use your money on your hobby, no questions asked.", "NTA\n\nI just wanted to say your tank sounds very cool and you sound very passionate about it. Please pardon the pun but there are plenty of other fish in the sea if this is the hill your lady wants to die on.", "You spend four pounds a day on your fish. Your lady spends more than that on fancy shoes and coffee.", "NTA \n\nHave you downright told her the fishtank means more to you than a 14 days vacation? \nThat its a hobby you enjoy, its worth more than the expenses? \n\nTell her you would rather cut down on takeaway/dates to save money, but the fishies are sentimental, relaxing and something you arent willing to give up. \n\nBut it does sound a bit like she dislikes the size of the tank. Does it fill up your livingroom? \nIt sounds like you keep it very well and personally i love them, even though I never really had one, but it could be she finds it doesn't fit her style and idea of how your home should look like.", "NTA, they are your pets and she is unreasonable to ask this of you.", "Nta, instead of replacing your tank maybe replace your gf with someone who doesn't care that you spend money on yourself instead of her (it honestly sounds like she just wants you to spend money on her \"she buys shoes more expensive than my tank\"", "Tell her to fuck off", "You deserve a hobby, keep the fish tank it is way cheaper than some hobbies! A hobby car and associated tools, even collecting comics could be more money!", "sounds like your girlfriend doesn't like or respect your hobby which is a *fundamental and integral* part of who you are. pretty big comparability issue imo.", "NTA As long as you're covering the costs of it, she doesn't get a say here. These are your pets.", ">She see's the tank as a \u00a31400+ a year expense where we could go on holiday instead or put the money into savings and do better things together without the fish tank.\n\nSo if you guys were struggling to get by and pay rent and stuff, I would see her point. But instead this is a matter of \"we could take a trip with the money.\"\n\nNTA\n\nI wouldn't stay with someone who told me to get rid of my dog because of costs (outside of a we're-about-to-go-homeless situation.) Your fish are no different.", "Can you maybe get a small solar array to help with energy costs?  Not sure it would matter because I agree that the cost itself isn't the issue and she just doesn't like or want the fish tank around.", "NTA. Keep the tank, get rid of the girlfriend. I\u2019d be concerned about her sabotaging it.", "She spent more on shoes than you did on your fish tank. She sounds terrible for trying to get you to downsize your fishtank when she spends frivolously.\n\nNTA. Maybe cut back on the delivery apps and see if she continues to complain about it so you'll know if it's the fish tank she dislikes specifically.", "It seems as though she is simplifying this to fish tank or holiday. Nothing is that simple. I suggest you both have a look at your complete budget and see where else you could cut to afford fish tank AND holiday. \n\nIf shoes are as important to her as fish tank is to you then shoes aren't the place to cut back either. You mention that there's lots of take out and food delivery in your household. Are there other areas like this where you could cut back without noticing much?", "NTA. If the fish in your tank are well looked after and have plenty of space, I don't see any harm in making this the thing you spend your money on. If she is spending 1400 a year on shoes and ordering a bunch of takeout, there are other things you can economise on.", "NTA.", "If you're paying for it NTA", "Yeah the hypocrisy there would make me have to calm down and count to 600 before I could have a discussion on it with my SO, do 20 pairs of shoes do anything for you when they're stored in the closet? \nThis man actually gets stress relieve from his hobby.\n\nNTA OP and don't concede on a smaller tank or any downsizing of the sorts unless she's willing to comprise her hobbies to the same value.", "These are pets with their own personalities, not disposable toys. It\u2019s a hobby but also a pet. I would not be happy if my partner told me to get rid of my Oscar fish, I raised him from 1 inch and now he\u2019s 6 years old and almost a foot long, and he acts like a little puppy. If you are paying for everything yourself there shouldn\u2019t be a problem as long as you\u2019re still able to pay bills and put food on the table. Do you pay for energy bills relating to the tank? If not, would doing so help with your girlfriend\u2019s unhappiness with the tank? If it continues being a problem it seems more like she doesn\u2019t want fish at all and could be very limiting in your enjoyment of the hobby.\n>Edit because I\u2019ve read more comments by OP: \nIt does sound like she is just not cool with the tank, and it\u2019s not actually about money. She signed up for someone who already had a tank, she does NOT get to decide she doesn\u2019t like it now. Be warned because this will continue to be problem in the future.", "Not even then.", "Someone telling you to get rid of your pets that you've had for longer than you've been together with them is not a minor issue. But your choice.", "I don\u2019t believe your relationship is doomed, but I don\u2019t believe this is a minor issue. It demonstrates that something that has deep meaning to you means nothing to her. That\u2019s a serious relationship problem.", "It sounds like you\u2019re doing your best, NTA for sure then.", "Agreed about the problem's seriousness, but I didn't see any indication that OP disrespects her love of shoes. That was important information about her being a willing to spend more than she allows him to."]}
