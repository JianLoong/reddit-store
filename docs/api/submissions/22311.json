I've always had a fish tank all of my life, but reef aquariums specifically since then.\n\nThings have got more expensive this year and energy bills especially in the UK are a problem, our bills have gone from \u00a3110/month to \u00a3240/month. I would estimate that my fish tank is 35% of our energy use, I totally concede this. There are also other costs like salt, food, chemicals and other bits as well. Total cost for the fish tank is probably \u00a3120/month\n\n\u00a380 in energy alone to run a fish tank is a lot, but this is a hobby I've had for a long time and not only that but I've got sentimental fish and coral that she just doesn't seem to understand. A lot of the coral came from my fathers tank, he died last year. My clownfish I've had for 12 years. Several fish are not available anymore either due to collection bans and I've got a group of shrimp in there that breed which is pretty much unheard of really.\n\nI've done my best to cut costs, I've switched to DIY chemicals for dosing instead of name brand stuff, I've changed my food to cheaper options, I've not bought a fish or coral for well over a year, I even sell bits of coral when they grow too much to local friends to help offset costs for some of the maintenance.\n\nTo me the tank is a hobby, it helps me relax and some of the things in there mean a lot to me due to them coming from my dads tank from when I was a kid. It's a lot of work, it's not cheap, sometimes I flood the floor slightly (she's very understanding over this)... But I really like it. \n\nShe see's the tank as a \u00a31400+ a year expense where we could go on holiday instead or put the money into savings and do better things together without the fish tank. I see this, I just don't value a holiday that will relax me for 2 weeks over a fish tank that relaxes me all the time.\n\nWe are comfortable, we are not struggling financially but we are not rich either. If we were struggling the tank would go, no question... For context we spend more in the pub or on food delivery apps than I do on my fish tank. She's spent more in shoes last year than I did on my fish tank. I just don't think she likes the fish tank or understands it, I have tried explaining...\n\nShe did suggest a compromise of replacing it with a smaller tank, but this would still mean getting rid of some of the fish and even buying lots of new equipment which would mean the savings would take years to take effect anyway.\n\nAm I in the wrong for wanting to keep my fish tank? I feel like the value it brings to my life is well worth the expense but am I just insane or biased towards it? I accept that having a reef tank is not normal, but I enjoy it.\n\nThanks", "created_utc": 1689430266, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150d241/aita_for_not_wanting_to_get_rid_of_my_fish_tank/", "score": 19, "replies": ["People would never tell someone to get rid of their dogs or cats but fish abuse and neglect is  so ingrained in society that it's like asking someone to get rid of some old toys... so disgusting.", "I just want to know if she\u2019d be saying the same thing if you had dogs instead of fish. \n\nNTA.", "NTA- You had the fish before she came into the scene not like you suddenly developed this expensive hobby.", "NTA.  Not everyone is going to understand our hobbies.  Setting aside the massive investment you\u2019ve put into your tank, you have irreplaceable livestock, some with tremendous sentimental value to you.  You\u2019ve been maintaining this tank for 18 years.  She knew you had the tank when she started dating you.  \n\nI\u2019d show her the breakdowns on the discretionary spending.

This more than just some random hobby for you. It\u2019s been an integral part of your life for a long time, and it has sentimental meaning to you too. If the two of you had to skip meals to afford it, that would be different. But you\u2019re financially okay.

If times were tough and we weren't able to pay bills then we'd obviously come to some agreement but in actual fact last year I actually bought him a guitar because I was proud of him for turning his life around. Also the fish are living creatures , I bet she would he horrified if you asked her to get rid of a pet- fish shouldn't be at the bottom of the pet hierarchy.", "NTA.

I had a fish tank for years with a bunch of cool things that always grabbed people\u2019s attention (crabs/crayfish)\n\nI ended up getting rid of it because maintenance got cumbersome and just got tired of maintaining it. \n\nAlways wanted a salt water tank. Just bring up the fact that money isn\u2019t tight and that it\u2019s something you thoroughly enjoy doing throughout the year, and if you want to go on holiday we can start cutting cost on materialistic things such as going out and shopping.", "NTA Try putting it to her this way: 'Are you willing to give up X if I give up the tank? Why not?' She does things that don't directly benefit you I'm sure. If you can get her to see that her shoes budget is equivalent to your fish budget and for the same reasons (it makes you both happy but it's not really needed), the conflict might ease. If not, maybe just designate fun money for you both that you can spend without justification and use your money for the fish.\n\nAlso, if there are things she wants to do, then great! Sit down with a budget and figure out how you \\*both\\* can cut back and work towards those goals. But don't forget to budget for fun stuff for you both throughout the year.", "NTA\u2014I you had the fish tank, went golfing, scuba diving, among other expensive hobbies then I could see her point. But if this is your primary hobby, and generally the only one that you invest money in, it boils down to \u00a34 a day, less than a cup of tea or coffee", "Nta dad's gone but the coral and fish aren't.   Keep it", "Nta. You wouldn't just get rid of a dog or a cat so nonchalantly.", "NTA. But it may come to a \"me or the fish tank\" moment. Which will you choose then?", "NTA- you had the fish before she was in your life she knew it was part of the package. I know these types of setups take a lot of time to take care of, she might just be jealous you\u2019re spending so much time with the fish and not her", "NTA if you've been doing this since you were 14 it's clearly a high value part of your life and identity, not a light pastime. I'm a total stranger yet even I can hear that.\n\nWould be different maybe if you were having to choose between having the tank and feeding your children or something but as long as it's not interfering with survival it seems like you should be able to prioritize what matters most to you.", "As a reefer, keep the tank, get rid of the GF. If she spends more on shoes but can't understand your hobby that involves living animals? Come on. NTA", "NTA but she is u had them for years and some of the stuff came from ur dad that u lost. U don't ask people to give up things or animals that came from dead parents that's just mean and insensitive. I have the social skills of a stick and I know that", "NTA\n\n\nThere are other expenses you can skim before the tank (pun intended!)", "I do agree on the fish front, they are seen as disposable. Very sad.\n\nBut on the coral front, these animals are immortal. They do not age like we do, they will live for 100's of years if they are left alone by predators, toxins and disasters.", "Difficult to answer, we split everything 50:50 (we earn the same) but I more than make up the \u00a340/month she \"pays\" to the fish tank in other ways. I usually pay for the expensive bits of date nights like theatre tickets, she pays for drinks to make up for it, she is happy with this as it's a good deal.", "We've been together for 5 years... It's not doomed, this is a minor issue.", "But is she paying any of the other costs like food and chemicals? Or do you pay that yourself?", "I don\u2019t believe your relationship is doomed, but I don\u2019t believe this is a minor issue.
