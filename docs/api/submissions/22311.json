I would estimate that my fish tank is 35% of our energy use, I totally concede this. There are also other costs like salt, food, chemicals and other bits as well. Total cost for the fish tank is probably \u00a3120/month\n\n\u00a380 in energy alone to run a fish tank is a lot, but this is a hobby I've had for a long time and not only that but I've got sentimental fish and coral that she just doesn't seem to understand. A lot of the coral came from my fathers tank, he died last year. My clownfish I've had for 12 years. Several fish are not available anymore either due to collection bans and I've got a group of shrimp in there that breed which is pretty much unheard of really.\n\nI've done my best to cut costs, I've switched to DIY chemicals for dosing instead of name brand stuff, I've changed my food to cheaper options, I've not bought a fish or coral for well over a year, I even sell bits of coral when they grow too much to local friends to help offset costs for some of the maintenance.\n\nTo me the tank is a hobby, it helps me relax and some of the things in there mean a lot to me due to them coming from my dads tank from when I was a kid. It's a lot of work, it's not cheap, sometimes I flood the floor slightly (she's very understanding over this)... But I really like it. \n\nShe see's the tank as a \u00a31400+ a year expense where we could go on holiday instead or put the money into savings and do better things together without the fish tank. I see this, I just don't value a holiday that will relax me for 2 weeks over a fish tank that relaxes me all the time.\n\nWe are comfortable, we are not struggling financially but we are not rich either. If we were struggling the tank would go, no question... For context we spend more in the pub or on food delivery apps than I do on my fish tank. She's spent more in shoes last year than I did on my fish tank. I just don't think she likes the fish tank or understands it, I have tried explaining...\n\nShe did suggest a compromise of replacing it with a smaller tank, but this would still mean getting rid of some of the fish and even buying lots of new equipment which would mean the savings would take years to take effect anyway.\n\nAm I in the wrong for wanting to keep my fish tank? I feel like the value it brings to my life is well worth the expense but am I just insane or biased towards it?

Why not?' She does things that don't directly benefit you I'm sure. If you can get her to see that her shoes budget is equivalent to your fish budget and for the same reasons (it makes you both happy but it's not really needed), the conflict might ease. If not, maybe just designate fun money for you both that you can spend without justification and use your money for the fish.\n\nAlso, if there are things she wants to do, then great!

Usually, wrongly, and the wronged party is promptly told to break up with that partner.\n\nI don't usually (sincerely) advise a tit-for-tat attitude but a budget/spending review might be a revelation in this relationship.\n\nAs for fish specifically as pets, they have personalities which makes their behaviours entertaining for their owners.

Nothing wrong with being attached to your fish and corals. I miss having fish tanks.", "You might want to mention to your GF that kids are even more expensive so the fish tank is a great deal. NTA", "NTA\n\nAnyone who wants you to dispose of sentimental gifts from a passed parent is automatically bad.", "I didn't.", "If someone told me to get rid of my birds, I would get rid of them instead, and you call it a minor issue. Can't say I understand \ud83d\ude10", "Amen. I have chronic pain and sometimes have a tough time cleaning my bird's cage on my bad days. But then she tips her head back to ask for snuggles and the pain is forgotten.", "of course it isn't about the money, that's glaringly obvious.\n\nSomething is fishy with your GF (pun intended), she's jealous about that tank. better see what's making her insecure or if it's a control issue on her part (bad).", "Her point is selfish. She's the one who wants a vacation. She could accomplish the same thing (reducing costs) by not buying any shoes as you've mentioned she does or by reducing how often you go out. But that would negatively effect her!  \n \n \n \n \n \nInstead, she's decided that you need to be the one to suffer to benefit her with a vacation. Honestly I'm insulted on your behalf.", "First, NTA. Second, are you sure this is about the tank and not because she wants to go on a holiday? Does the need for regular tank maintenance prevent you from leaving for extended periods of time? Because it sounds like the money isn't actually a big problem for you.", "You sorted the matter before the cost of living went up, it\u2019s time to renegotiate the deal. Instead of spending that 40 out, split the electric bill 60/40 so that she isn\u2019t being effected by the fish tank at all.", "NTA that sounds like an amazing tank, and I'm sad you didn't post pictures. People don't view fish the same way as fuzzy pets you can handle. That's not much to spend on a hobby you are really into compared to other options and other pets", "Absolutely NTA. If your reporting is accurate, why not counter with cutting out food delivery apps to fund your holiday?", "I was sympathetic to your girlfriend until reading she pays more to shoes. I really hope you won't marry her.", "NTA. I\u2019d be so angry if someone asked me to get rid of my fish tanks. \n\nSlightly unrelated but I\u2019d love to see a picture of your setup :))", "Taking care of a aquarium is a lot of work and gives people a real sense of satisfaction and peace. It's worth it for you to spend time and money on your 'hobby'.  Enjoy, NTAH.", "NTA - Roes before ho's my dude", "NTA.  I keep exotic critters also (snakes and lizards) so I do understand the costs involved with giving them appropriate environments so they can thrive.\n\nThat said, glass tanks are notoriously inefficient for retaining heat, which is why I use PVC or melamine reptile enclosures.  Can you cover three sides of the tank with insulation to help reduce your energy bill, so you can still view the fish through the one remaining long side of the tank?  I'm assuming you already have a cover on the top for lighting and to hold the thermometer, any hoses needed for air or water pumps, etc.\n\nOtherwise, it sounds like your gf may either be jealous of the time you spend on the tank, or she's upset because she wants to travel but a tank like yours requires fairly regular maintenance so you can't just walk away from it for a week and expect everything to be fine, and most pet sitters aren't knowledgeable enough to handle something that specialized.  Goodness knows I would never find a pet sitter with the experience to handle my critters, but my husband and I are ok with not going away together longer than an overnight.", "NTA, but it's unfair to also not ever go on vacation with her (which is what it sounds like).  Why not set up a vacation fund that you both contribute to, taking money from some of the other discretionary spending that you both do?", "You didn\u2019t mention how long you\u2019ve had the GF. She seems jealous of your tank. She wants to cut expenses, but only your expenses. I\u2019m sure her shoes bring you no pleasure. I\u2019d suggest setting up a budget and having your personal items come from your individual funds.", "Nta, but you should cover the cost exclusively. I've got pets but their expenses are my own.", "NTA- fish are pets. You have been the loving owner of some of these pets for over a decade. The hobby itself is incredibly sentimental to you. The coral came from your father and I imagine it's part of how you relax with grief from his passing. You've cut costs where you can.\n\nNot only do I think you're not the ass, I think you shouldn't get rid of it. I'm actually a little worried that your girlfriend doesn't get how important this is especially considering you're not in \"too poor to keep a pet\" territory.", "NTA - they are still pets and shouldn't just be thrown away, as you said your not struggling and it seems like its beneficial to your mental health while having a lot of sentimental value. I would agree it seems like she doesn't like the fish tank. It may help to discuss all finances further as if she would like a holiday or saving you could discuss other ways to make this happen.", "NTA. You don\u2019t spend money just to survive. If you can afford it, you also spend it to enjoy life. If fish tanks are what makes you happy, by all means go for it.", "I\u2019m horrified that she thinks it\u2019s ok to demand how you spend your money not to mention the callous way way she regards your beautiful tank. I\u2019m also sorry for the loss of your dad. Pay attention, her attitude makes me slightly worried that she would sabotage it. \n\nIt sounds like you should divide your finances if they aren\u2019t already. You should each pay for half of the rent and you should pay 2/3rds if the electricity. Beyond that, it\u2019s honestly not her business what you spend your money on. I would explain to her *once* that you don\u2019t criticize her spending money on shoes or makeup. So she doesn\u2019t have the right to criticize your spending. Each person should pay half of the vacation so unless she\u2019s got money for her half of the vacation and you haven\u2019t, she has no business criticizing your spending. If that\u2019s an issue, an extra part time job would be a better option than letting your tank go.", "bad bot.", "Start actually paying 70 percent of the electricity bills.\nI'm sure she sees herself paying you back for the little extras you do, through things she already does. So pay 70 percent of the bill.", "Well then put aside the money you would have paid on paying all the electricity bill and book a holiday.", "NTA. Your girlfriend sounds like a real prize.", "NTA, find someone that understands you and accepts you and your tank", "NAH\n\nYou need to decide if someone who doesn't understand the value this reef tank has for you is worth giving it up for.\n\nMy now-husband always had freshwater tanks when we were dating and they were important to him. He tried a saltwater tank one time and it is hard work! If you love it, you can't let that go unless you are 1000% sure that your girlfriend is the person for you.", "Tell her if she gives up makeup and shoes for a year you'll consider giving up the reef tank. But she can't go back to makeup or shoes.", "I\u2019ve bred geckos before. I lost a few geckos in a freak accident a few years ago and was so upset because I love them like people love a pet dog or cat. \n\nI was grieving the next day and someone at work asked me what was wrong. I told them and the response was \u201cSo? It\u2019s not like it was a dog or anything\u2026.\u201d It was such a punch in the face I had to go home early.", "I really don't think this has anything to do with money or vacation; she doesn't like the fish and tank, and she wants you to get rid of them. She just thought that vacation would be a good reason to convince you to get rid of a big part of your life. Maybe she's jealous that you have something besides her that you feel strongly about."]}
