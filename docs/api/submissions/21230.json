It was early and I think they thought everyone was alseep but they were discussing chores and things like that. To give you an idea all the kids help with chores there is four of us two boys and two girls, d is the oldest he is 22, then k he is 19, then E she is 18, then there is me. We all clean our downstairs bathroom (which guest and our parents both use)and the kids upstairs bathroom. D had to mow and do yard work, k has to take out trash and clean garbage cans, E has to sweep and mop out entire house, I vacuum and dust our entire house as well. My mom is very nitpicky and we never do anything the way she wants but she barley helps she also praises the two oldest boys constantly but us girls never get praised or even a thank you. Me and E both do extra things such as wiping down kitchen even if we didn't make the mess, doing dishes that get thrown in the sink, ect. Recently my told us we haven't been doing enough and I never knew why but after that conversation I know its because her husband. He said \"those girls dont ever do shit\". He has put us down before but to discredit everthing we do really pissed me off. He works 3 days a week then the rest of the 4 days plays video games he doesn't cook but once in a blue moon. I am in school full time, work 4 to 5 days a week, I cook at least 1 or 2 a week, get the groceries 90% of the time, do dinner dishes. I have helped my mom out for a long time but im sick of it I get told I dont do anything so thats exactly what I did. Two weeks ago I stopped getting groceries, cooking dinner, doing dinner dishes, all I did was my basic chores that we were all assigned like my brothers do. I've heard this look comments they've all made since this change but I'm so sick of not being appreciated or at least acknowledge and yet I'm the ungrateful child for feeling this way. my mother had a screaming fit over the phone when I went to my friends instead of going grocery shopping for I guess now she knows how it feels to constantly be let down.
