My husband's family was never really accepting of me because when we got together I wasn't what his family expected to love. Well, he came home about 2 months ago and he got a really good felon friendly job an hour and a half away from our home town so I uprooted myself and my child away from my support system to live with my husband. Due to past trauma I don't really like the idea of strangers taking care of my child, especially because he is hearing impaired and doesn't speak much or very clearly so we decided I wouldn't work until my son starts school. Last week on Friday afternoon, my husband's grandparents showed up at my house and I was excited because my son hasn't met them and I felt it would be good for him to get to know them. \n\n\n       About an hour into visiting they asked me to pack up an overnight bag and some money for food as they were there to pick him up and take him back to their house for the night. I said no, because they are strangers to my son. I called my husband who was about to get off work and told him his grandparents were here and that they were insisting on taking my child with them to their place which is also in our hometown. He told me that he asked them to do that so we could have some much needed alone time as husband and wife since we don't get to be alone anymore. I told him it made me uncomfortable and I was not letting what are essentially strangers to him take him to another town and hour and half away overnight. After about 10 mins of going back and forth and getting no where I told him to come home and we'll talk about it in more detail but I'm dying on this hill that our child isn't going anywhere with them alone, especially not overnight. \n\nHis grandparents kept insisting that they raised multiple children and that one night away would be beneficial to me and my marriage. I just don't feel comfortable with it, my son cannot communicate clearly and has specific routines, restrictions and needs that they don't know about and I'm not going to put him in a situation where he's not getting those needs met with people he has never met before today. I told husband If he wanted a night alone with me, I could ask my parents to babysit him as they have been around his whole life and know everything he needs to be safe and comfortable. My husband thinks it isn't fair that my family can watch him but his cannot. I'm getting the silent treatment now and I'm starting to think I was being too overprotective. \n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677903807, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hpbpl/aita_for_not_allowing_my_husbands_grandparents/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don\u2019t know them, your son doesn\u2019t know them, and how can you trust that he will be safe? If this is the first they\u2019ve met him, there\u2019s no way that they are capable of effectively communicating with him. His father needs a reality check. Do not let anyone (father included) be alone with him until they have proven that your son is comfortable and safe", "NTA\n\nYour husband didn\u2019t even bring this up with you? Yikes. He needs to communicate before doing something like this.", "NTA\n\nThis was the first time your son was meeting his grandparents so they are strangers to him. It would not be a good idea for them to take him for the night after just meeting him. Once he gets to know them and they understand his needs after more visits you may be comfortable letting him stay with them overnight. They're being too presumptuous and entitled telling you to pack a bag for him without even discussing it with you first.", "NTA meanwhile the dad was in prison his family could\u2019ve visited or offered support and get to know your son but they didn\u2019t so they don\u2019t get to call you irrational now. Dad doesn\u2019t get to spring things like that on you and your son and his family that stayed away don\u2019t get to make demands of you and your son after meeting him for the first time. Yes your family that has been there, knows him, knows how to care for him and learnt how to communicate with him get to spend time with him alone, it would be remiss to put your son in danger with his family that know nothing of his needs or personality. \n\nYour husband is the selfish arsehole in this and his family is not far off from him. If they cared they would\u2019ve  tried to have a relationship with your son before now. So what if you\u2019re protective of your son? You\u2019re the only one putting your sons needs first and you had to care for him alone until your husband got out of prison\u2026 your husband should be thanking you, supporting you both, learning about and getting to know his son not adding stress and being childish", "NTA, \n\nShame your husband is putting his own needs over the well-being of his child but I\u2019m glad you stood your ground, because you are absolutely right in not letting them take him. If they really want to be involved grandparents, they\u2019ll have to put in the work first and at least build some sort of relationship first, before taking a toddler over night.", "NTA. not even close to being an asshole. Your child, your rules, you don\u2019t know these people and more importantly he doesn\u2019t know these people. Idk you or your husband obviously but having your child\u2019s great grandparents show up to take him away from you for a night during the first time he\u2019s ever met them and you knowing nothing about it does not sit right with me.", "NTA and why did your husband think this needed to be a surprise?", "NTA. YOUR kid, YOUR rules. Not theirs.", "NTA \n\nYou have never been to their home. You don\u2019t know how they live, where your son will sleep and you don\u2019t know them period. \n\nYou could uses ASL and has hearing loss. Do they know ASL? Why is your husband acting uncaring over your child\u2019s wants/needs and comfort especially for bed time? \n\nYour husband giving you the silent treatment is manipulative and makes him TA. Does he not think your child will miss you both when strangers are putting him to bed and when he is sleeping in a strange place? \n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffdAfter several visits in their house and yours, they can first watch him for an afternoon etc. But you graduate to having a sleepover with great grandparents\u2026 you don\u2019t START with it! \n\nGood luck OP!", "NTA. So you lived in the same town as his grandparents until your husband was released? They didn't take the time to know your child then? They left you to be a single mother for how long because they didn't support your relationship though you stuck with their felon grandson while he was incarcerated. But now they want to help your marriage and know your son as long as you chip in for food. They're assholes. They wasted three years when they could have bonded with your son and supported you.\n\nI get your husband is trying to make up for lost time with you as his wife and life is different than when he left, but he's an asshole for springing this on you and expecting you to suddenly trust people who didn't look out for you while he was away. That's terrible. Please tell me marriage counseling is ongoing because he needs to work out his priorities and you need to get support for the trauma you have dealt with.", "NTA family or not, they just met your kid\u2026you did the right thing. Your DH is an ass though, he should\u2019ve discussed this with you first.", "NTA. Did they come unannounced? The fact that they asked for money is odd to me, especially if they just showed up and started insisting. Was it the first time he met them? Either way, this is a hill I\u2019d also die on!", "He should have talked to you first. But has he been trying other ways to get alone time with you and you have refused other times to let someone babysit your son? It\u2019s weird they tried to take him having it be the first time they met. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an asshole move to say no you\u2019re not comfortable.", "Nta. And sorry but your husband has only known the kid 2 months. He really doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on", "I wouldn't let these people take my dog for a walk, no way should let them take your child with special needs.  If your husband wants alone time with you, you both need to schedule it, he can't just drop this on you.\n\nNTA", "NTA... stick to your instincts.  Maybe stay over with him if you feel they are worth learning to trust", "NTA.  Firstly, your husband should have talked to you first and asked you about it before arranging for his grandparents to show up and \"surprise\" you.  Secondly, follow your gut instinct, momma.  You have every right to say no to him staying overnight with people you and he don't know and trust.  Your husband's family sounds like they haven't given you a reason to trust, them, either.", "NTA. Your husband doesn't even know his kid let alone his parents. I'd die on that hill too.", "NTA \n\nYour kid doesn\u2019t even know these people. \n\nYour kid only just knows his father.", "NTA \n\nI imagine this must be terrifying for a 3 year old. Some people you never met before come to your home and you're just supposed to go with them and sleep at a place you've very been. Just No!", "OMG you are SO \\*NOT\\* TA!  Your poor kiddo would be scared to death.  ANY three year old would be scared, never mind a kid with a disability who has all these special work-arounds to communicate. \n\nI really, really hope that your husband did this out of ignorance, not because he doesn't care about your child.  Kids aren't furniture, you can't just hand them off to someone they've never met!  If this really is ignorance, and not jealousy on your husband's part, then maybe some parenting classes would help him.   I'm not too thrilled with the grandparents, either, if they really raised children well, they would know better than to try that.", "You are NOT the AH.\n\nNot only died your child not know these people, you don't.\n\nSo what they're his blood?\n\nAnd I'm going low here but f it; he's a felon and that runs in families - that is stats and some science.\n\nSo no, you are NOT the AH for looking out for your child above your SOs desire to get it on.\n\nIt's over the top fishy that he's so hot and bothered as to not even have consulted with you and gone right on to arrange all this but pull up short when you're willing to have your parents watch him for the night.\n\nWow some people treating their kids like a Polly Pocket to be stored away when not convenient.\n\nOr in your SO's case - when he's in rutt.", "Op did you explain to them your son is special needs?", "NTA\n\nThey shouldn\u2019t have sprung this on you, first of all. It sounds like both your husband and the in-laws screwed that up.\n\nThey should have made an effort to get to know their great-grandchild when he was younger. I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable sending any child of any age overnight with family they hadn\u2019t met\u2014let alone a child with some special needs.\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely in the right to protect your son.", "NTA. Your husband needs a reality check. He's never had to be a parent until 2 months ago. Not only is he stepping into the role with a toddler, but your son has special needs. Your husband doesn't seem to grasp how important it is to be able to meet your son's needs or how upsetting it would be for a toddler to suddenly be taken away from home by strangers. He doesn't understand what you went through giving birth and raising a baby on your own and he doesn't understand the immense shift in priorities for you after your son was born because your husband wasn't there for that early bonding as a parent. \n\nHe's acting frustrated and like your son is an obstacle. Ask him why he cares more about sex than what's best for his child? He needs to realize it's completely normal for parents to be tired and not get a lot of adult only time. More so with a toddler. And especially more with a child that has disabilities.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your husband wanting time with you to bond as a couple is nice.

He\u2019s the AH for expecting people who would do such a thing to take overnight responsibility *over an hour away* after their first meeting with little to no training in specialized care. He\u2019s also the AH for giving his wife the silent treatment. \n\nThe husband is an absolute AH and needs to be working *with* his wife for quality time. Not in spite of her."]}
