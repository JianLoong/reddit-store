My husband's family was never really accepting of me because when we got together I wasn't what his family expected to love. Well, he came home about 2 months ago and he got a really good felon friendly job an hour and a half away from our home town so I uprooted myself and my child away from my support system to live with my husband. Due to past trauma I don't really like the idea of strangers taking care of my child, especially because he is hearing impaired and doesn't speak much or very clearly so we decided I wouldn't work until my son starts school. Last week on Friday afternoon, my husband's grandparents showed up at my house and I was excited because my son hasn't met them and I felt it would be good for him to get to know them. \n\n\n       About an hour into visiting they asked me to pack up an overnight bag and some money for food as they were there to pick him up and take him back to their house for the night. I said no, because they are strangers to my son. I called my husband who was about to get off work and told him his grandparents were here and that they were insisting on taking my child with them to their place which is also in our hometown. He told me that he asked them to do that so we could have some much needed alone time as husband and wife since we don't get to be alone anymore. I told him it made me uncomfortable and I was not letting what are essentially strangers to him take him to another town and hour and half away overnight. After about 10 mins of going back and forth and getting no where I told him to come home and we'll talk about it in more detail but I'm dying on this hill that our child isn't going anywhere with them alone, especially not overnight. \n\nHis grandparents kept insisting that they raised multiple children and that one night away would be beneficial to me and my marriage. I just don't feel comfortable with it, my son cannot communicate clearly and has specific routines, restrictions and needs that they don't know about and I'm not going to put him in a situation where he's not getting those needs met with people he has never met before today. I told husband If he wanted a night alone with me, I could ask my parents to babysit him as they have been around his whole life and know everything he needs to be safe and comfortable. My husband thinks it isn't fair that my family can watch him but his cannot.

Yes your family that has been there, knows him, knows how to care for him and learnt how to communicate with him get to spend time with him alone, it would be remiss to put your son in danger with his family that know nothing of his needs or personality. \n\nYour husband is the selfish arsehole in this and his family is not far off from him.

They wasted three years when they could have bonded with your son and supported you.\n\nI get your husband is trying to make up for lost time with you as his wife and life is different than when he left, but he's an asshole for springing this on you and expecting you to suddenly trust people who didn't look out for you while he was away.

ANY three year old would be scared, never mind a kid with a disability who has all these special work-arounds to communicate. \n\nI really, really hope that your husband did this out of ignorance, not because he doesn't care about your child.

Your husband needs a reality check. He's never had to be a parent until 2 months ago. Not only is he stepping into the role with a toddler, but your son has special needs. Your husband doesn't seem to grasp how important it is to be able to meet your son's needs or how upsetting it would be for a toddler to suddenly be taken away from home by strangers. He doesn't understand what you went through giving birth and raising a baby on your own and he doesn't understand the immense shift in priorities for you after your son was born because your husband wasn't there for that early bonding as a parent. \n\nHe's acting frustrated and like your son is an obstacle. Ask him why he cares more about sex than what's best for his child? He needs to realize it's completely normal for parents to be tired and not get a lot of adult only time. More so with a toddler.

I called my husband who was about to get off work and told him his grandparents were here and that they were insisting on taking my child with them to their place which is also in our hometown. He told me that he asked them to do that so we could have some much needed alone time as husband and wife since we don't get to be alone anymore. I told him it made me uncomfortable and I was not letting what are essentially strangers to him take him to another town and hour and half away overnight. After about 10 mins of going back and forth and getting no where I told him to come home and we'll talk about it in more detail but I'm dying on this hill that our child isn't going anywhere with them alone, especially not overnight.", "Because it would be harder for OP to say no to his grandparents' faces when they already drove 90 minutes to get the kid. It would require confrontation and appearing ungrateful which her husband was expecting she'd be conditioned to avoid. But he doesn't know his wife's will or determination now that she's a mother to push past her own ingrained conditioning to protect her child. Her husband made a huge mistake underestimating who OP cares about and how she'd protect them.", "Because husband is an asshole who is only thinking about himself and his dick.", "OP says they are a felon in the post. And it\u2019s relevant because job opportunities for felons are limited, which is why she had to make the sacrifice of moving away from her support network.", "No this comment makes zero reference to that. Just wanted to point out their possibly a felon because they went to prison. OP never actually stated he's a felon lol. Everyone just assumes because he's been to prison right.", "Also the job opportunities really aren't that limited for felons.  There is plenty of work and you can get great pay too. People use it as an excuse lol.", "\u201cHe got a really good felon friendly job\u2026\u201d", "Ok I'll give you that\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 my bad but there is still zero reason as to why she had to point out felon husband, felon job, felon anything. That doesn't define him.", "You do sound overall a bit overprotective, but in this specific situation, NTA. These people are strangers to your kid and the FIRST thing they're doing with him is taking him away, alone for the night?\n\nThis is the kind of thing where they need to have at least met before.", "NTA, they are strangers to the poor kid. In time they won\u2019t be, and a nice overnighter will be fun, but not until the kid knows them better, even asks for them. I can see taking him locally to lunch or a play space for a few hours. But overnight right now, no. And your husband should have run this by you before making those plans.", "NTA.  This whole situation is messed up.", "NTA- you are looking out for your son's best interest! You don't know these people, your son doesn't know these people, they can't just appear out of no where and take your child for a night!", "Your husband is clueless\u2026 he wants to take a child away from their mother to give to strangers that both you and the child don\u2019t know and trust and thinks that\u2019s going to put you in a romantic mood?  What else was he planning to force himself on you while you\u2019re worried about your son all night long? \n\nNTA and honestly do better for yourself and your son. You would be TA if you stick around.", "NTA. Even without your son's special requirements, you shouldn't send him away with people who are basically strangers to him. Your husband needs to understand this, and if he refuses, make sure what you say, goes. Mummy knows best in this situation, as in many others I'll wager.", "So they can have \u201chusband and wife alone time.\u201d Fucking yikes.", "If the great-grandparents want to take him overnight, they need to put in the time to get to know him first. OP's husband should want his family to know his child, so he should ensure that they get to know him \u2013 by spending time with all three of them (OP, husband, child) together, not just the child alone.\n\nOP's husband is a huge AH for springing this on her, for not understanding why OP is so resistant, and for using the silent treatment now. OP is NTA, not even remotely. She's the only one who is acting in the child's best interest; her husband should pay attention and follow her lead.", "Thats not on op. Op wasnt made aware. How would you feel third time meeting these people and first time for your child. Said pack a bag and give me money im taking your kid for the night? Any parent would be upset especially it sounds entitled when parent was not asked beforehand.", "NTA\n\nFirstly, I think that you're underreacting. Your husband consciously chose to give your son to people you don't know. He was complicit in sending them to your home. I'm sure he was trying to use social pressure or something to make you give the grandparents your son.\n\nYour don't have any positive words about your husband. He doesn't seem to care about you or his son. You uprooted your life and are now isolated. This is basic abusive behavior to try and take control of someone.\n\nTo be frank, there's nothing keeping your husband from just giving the kid to his parents when you're not there. This is wild behavior and needs to be treated as such. You can't trust your husband right now.\n\nIf there's anything that could go wrong, it'd be with extremely elderly people that you don't know.They could have conditions or habits that are both terrible for them and don't get taken care of. It doesn't matter if they're good people or not if Grandma chooses to chain-smoke or Grandpa has a medical issue that could crash a car.\n\nImo, take your kid and go back home asap.", "\"My husband's family was never really accepting of me because when we got together I wasn't what his family expected to love.\"\n\nThis is the most concerning part for me. I mean, what does this even mean? Is there a racial or cultural difference here? NTA.", "NTA", "NTA .\n.\nyou uprooted your life and moved for this guy? wow", "Never mind your husband's feelings - the child does not know these people. How traumatic to just pack him off with people who are strangers. NTA and the silent treatment is manipulative.", "All I can think is how scary and confusing it would be for OP\u2019s son. Suddenly 2 random strangers are taking you away from your Mom and house to go on a long car ride, to a strange house for who knows how long.\n\nVery much NTA.", "NTA. I have a 4 year old that doesn\u2019t speak yet and used to be hearing impaired. Although it is believed he is autistic (no official diagnosis yet). I mention this to let you know I know how you feel; my husband and I are the only people who for the most part understand him and his needs. He has never slept anywhere else because he has his routine here, but he has been to my moms house a lot to play.\n\nI\u2019d trust my mom with him, but I for example would not trust my dad. I have no doubt he would not know or do everything my son needs. It\u2019s not a matter of being incapable, but my father just hasn\u2019t been around my son as much as my mom. Do what your gut tells you to do, especially when it comes to your kid. You know him best!", "I think offering up your parents to watch them did more harm then good. Instead offer to include his parents so they do not become strangers and can eventually watch him. Your concerns are valid but the grandparents should be allowed to spend time with there grandson if they are willing to work with you on this.", "NTA\n\n>my son cannot communicate clearly and has specific routines, restrictions and needs that they don't know about\n\nSo I'm assuming he has something like autism etc for him to not be able to communicate clearly at age 3 and needing routines/restrictions etc? If so then of course you aren't going to leave your child with strangers!\n\nWhy did your husband go to prison?", "NTA. He's THREE, for heaven's sake. They are strangers. Your husband is nuts, and his parents are worse.", "NTA. Husband should have suggested a date night to you then asked you about having his grandparents take your son overnight. You would have had time to express your concerns, maybe set up a couple of times for them to come over so you and your son could get to know them better.", "NTA. So the felon is going to vouch for someone? Isn't that rich.\nYou don't know these people at all.   Why does your kid need to be away anyways? I never understand why people have kids and then try to dump them elsewhere.", ">My husband thinks it isn't fair that my family can watch him but his cannot.\n\nActually it is fair - each family and family member is being judged according to their actions, interest, emotional and time investment in your son. \n\nHubby wants his grandparents to be given the same rights and responsibilities as your parents even though they've done nothing to deserve it. That's what wouldn't be fair", "It's a racial thing I presume, but they always painted it in a weird \"she's not exactly your type\" light. My husband thinks it's because of politics.", "He actually has significant hearing loss in one ear so he has a really hard time with words. He knows some basic things in ASL but we have multiple ways of figuring out what he wants/needs. \n\nMy husband went to prison on a marijuana charge, we live in a state where it's not legal and he was caught growing it.", "Dude wanted sexy time at the expense of his son's and wife's comfort and is now sulking. Big yikes.", "Yeah, that part made me throw up in my mouth. This is purely speculation but it\u2019s sus that he sent his grandparents in, who then put her on the spot, which then made it awkward to refuse this \u201ckind gesture\u201d. If he really wanted his grandparents to get to know his kid, he could\u2019ve had them building that rapport while he was away, or seeing them just as frequently as her parents.\n\nTbh, I am willing to bet that he didn\u2019t have a romantic night planned that fostered emotional intimacy. Rather, he was expecting her to have an all night uninterrupted fuckfest. \n\nI hope my hunch isn\u2019t right because that would mean that he\u2019s willing to prioritize a bang session over his child\u2019s safety. Defff not winning any father of the year awards anytime soon", "It\u2019s weird they tried to take him having it be the first time they met.", "Imagine going to prison, your loyal wife waiting for you to come out and raising your son alone instead of divorcing you, then coming out and throwing your weight around because things aren\u2019t how you wanted them. The ENTITLEMENT. You got yourself a real winner there! So nice that he\u2019s grateful for everything you\u2019ve done. So nice that he\u2019s showing that gratitude with silent treatments and manipulations and guilt trips. NTA.", "It is on OP how she responded to them. They did nothing wrong. They responded to their grandsons request. She could\u2019ve suggested them getting to know him over time and maybe in a month or two they would be ready for an overnight. Right now she is just being an obstacle because he was an idiot. So they both suck. Grandparents are innocent.", "There is no way in hell you should let this child spend time alone in any kind of dwelling you haven't been too first. huge red flags that this husband of yours sprung this on you as a surprise. Personally, I would divorce immediately and move back to my support network within a week's time tops", "Being a felon is defining in most people's lives forever. They have incarceration, lost family time, restitution, a problematic criminal background that impacts their employment and living conditions, their access to education funding can be restricter, travel to other countries is stricter for people who have criminal records, and often they have a difficult or impossible task to restore their right to vote. Just doing their time, finishing parole, and paying their restitution does not end their punishment.\n\nIt defined their living situation when OP and her husband moved for his job opportunity. Its not a minor hiccup in their lives, it caused their relationship to be restricted and he missed much of his young child's life so far and he didn't facilitate relationships with his family and his wife and child from prison.", "In the eyes of most employers, yes it does.\nAnd in the case of this post, it directly impacted their lives and is a part of why they are where they are now. It's 100% relevant here."]}
