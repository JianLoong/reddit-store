He has recently started dating a woman I do not care for, nor does the rest of the family. she's just bad news, but he is an adult and will date who he wants. This relationship has driven huge divides in the family because we have requested to not have her around, and he aggressively brings her along.\n\nRecently I noticed 2 new profiles added to my Hulu account. Both were labeled with simply an email address(one marked as \"kids\"). The email was a combination of first/last name with some numbers. The first name looked familiar and I initially thought it had something to do with my nephew despite him having his own profile. I shrugged it off at the time but never really forgot about it. A couple days later I do some digging and find out I was wrong about the email being linked to my nephews. Confused I asked people in the house if the name was familiar to them and everyone said no.\n\nI decided to send a message to the email. It read as follows : \n\n\"I was recently made aware that this email is linked to my Hulu account. \n\nI don't know who you are or how you got access to it. \n\nConsider this your notice that the passwords will be getting changed and you will be removed. \"\n\nThe next day I figured I'd ask my brother ( B ). \nI asked him if he gave my log-in to anyone and he said \"not that I'm aware of\". I then asked him if he recognized the name on the email. He replied with \" oh that's (gf-nobody-likes) parents. We were at their house watching. \"\n\nAs a knee jerk reaction I said \"oh I deleted their profiles and changed the PW because I didn't know who that was. Sorry lol \" wanting to keep the mood light. \n\nThe next day my brother messages me and asks about if I had sent them an email. I said yes, but that was before i knew it was (gfs) parents, he then asked me to email them again and apologize. \nIn the moment I said \" yeah sure, but why \" I explained that I had said I didn't know who they were, and that I was changing the pw. \nHe responded with \" oh, he made it sound like you were accusing him of stealing your account\" \nAnd I just \" lol, no \" \nThinking that was the end of it - several days have gone by and I got another message asking \" did you send the email yet? \". \n\nI have zero interest in apologizing, I didn't do anything wrong.

Or brother gave it to them directly.\n\nEither way the gf's parents then proceed to make another profile for their kids. Why else would the profile name be the parent's email?\n\nI'd change the pw and not give them to bro.

Your brothers girlfriends parents being upset or whatnot sounds like your brothers problem not yours. Your apology to your brother should be changing your password and NOT sharing it with your brother.", "Your brother seems very entitled to your acct.  he knew it was yours, yet he shared it with his girlfriends parents?  That\u2019s abuse.  What I would do if I were you, is discontinue Hulu for a time.  Email the parents and explain that you are sorry that your brother feels okay with sharing your personal accts with strangers\u2026and that it\u2019s sad he is so disrespectful to them and you\u2026and you have since cancelled your acct, because it appeared like it had been hacked.", "Send an email to confirm with them that their profiles have been successfully removed.
