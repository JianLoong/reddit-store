He has recently started dating a woman I do not care for, nor does the rest of the family. she's just bad news, but he is an adult and will date who he wants. This relationship has driven huge divides in the family because we have requested to not have her around, and he aggressively brings her along.\n\nRecently I noticed 2 new profiles added to my Hulu account. Both were labeled with simply an email address(one marked as \"kids\"). The email was a combination of first/last name with some numbers.

A couple days later I do some digging and find out I was wrong about the email being linked to my nephews. Confused I asked people in the house if the name was familiar to them and everyone said no.\n\nI decided to send a message to the email.
