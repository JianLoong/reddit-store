Fair enough.\n\nBut on the other hand, you also suck for giving her something she explicitly said she didn't want, and acting like she should be grateful since she's a charity case.

I mean, it sounds like she anticipated it, from what you describe as the \"three paragraphs insisting she only wanted gifts from the registry.\" Gee, wonder who that was intended for?\n\nYou literally could have bought ANYTHING ELSE on that registry and given it to her, no skin off your nose whatsoever for making her happy. Then when the time came and her stroller of choice did not manifest off the registry, offered your hand-me-down stroller as a make-do.\n\nYou get zero points for generosity if it doesn't include generosity of spirit.", "Yes it is a little entitled to ask for \u201conly from the registry\u201d.

People put stuff on a registry and want people to stick to a registry for reasons other than entitlement.

It completely clashes with the style. Or you get them a baby monitor and they already have one. It\u2019s kind of a pain to have to worry about giving away or returning unwanted or duplicative gifts on top of being a single parent. \n\nA stroller is a nice gift and a useful one to boot. But, we live in a society with prejudices and preconceived judgments based off of appearances. And it\u2019s possible your sister doesn\u2019t want to deal with the constant: \u201coh your daughter is so cute\u201d and then having to correct people. Is it fair or right we associate colors with a gender? Probably not, but it happens. She probably should not have thrown a fit at the baby shower but without knowing more context of her fit, some of it could be misdirected hormones.

That could be something between sisters, but not a shower gift. Inappropriate. As for the pink stroller for a boy..you think it doesn't matter what color it is?

I think you just wanted to put her in her place because she was being assertive in wanting nice thi gs for her baby.", "YTA. The \"only from the registry\" could simply be because Heidi had limited space and budget and doesn't want gifts she won't use or repeat gifts.

It should have been offered to her in advance so she could decide if she wanted to leave the stroller on that she'd chosen, or after if the stroller wasn't one of the gifts purchased.

There may have been specific reasons she wanted that particular pram that she had listed on the registry - maybe how it steered, how it collapsed, how it fit in her car etc. all of which are valid reasons for wanting a specific product. If you wanted to OFFER her your pram, that should have been done out side of the event and with a discussion of \u201chey I know money is kind of tight so if no one gets you the pram you wanted, would you be happy to use my old one in the mean time?\u201d.\n\nSister - yeah the reaction to it being a \u201cgirls pram\u201d is seriously over the top. Baby doesn\u2019t care what the vehicle it\u2019s in looks like. That said I\u2019m impressed OP had one that wasn\u2019t black or grey as that seems to be the only options like 90% of the time. Sister could have graciously accepted the gift and then later after the party returned it to OP if she didn\u2019t want it. Having an argument at the party is tacky and comes off very entitled, invalidating any rational reason she may have had for wanting the other one specifically because instead she just seems ungrateful. \n\nAs for the 3 paragraphs of only get what\u2019s on the registry, I think it\u2019s actually fair. She\u2019s currently staying in a home that isn\u2019t her own, so she has limited space. At baby showers guests so often get gifts they want to give because they\u2019re cute - not gifts that are actually practical or needed. Eg, that super adorable fluffy bunny outfit? Yeah that\u2019s hand wash only and will be ruined the first time the baby spits up in it, also the baby is born in summer so by the time its cold enough to wear it the baby has grown out of it, so literally never used except for being put on for 5 minutes to take some \u201cthank you\u201d photos. A baby doesn\u2019t need the wardrobe of a runway model, and yet baby clothes galore. Bottles and dummy\u2019s? They\u2019re very much a personal preference. Toys? Child won\u2019t be playing with them for about 3-6 months so that\u2019s just taking up space. And then there\u2019s that wacky aunt who buys a bike or something in that vein not thinking about the fact it now has to be stored for 2-4 years. \nGolden rule of baby showers, get them what they ask for, if you want to get them something different ask first, and if you really want to spoil them, get them vouchers for things like cleaning, food, nappies etc. \n\nDid I feel glamours getting my best friend 3 boxes of nappies? Nope. But they sure as shit got used.", "ESH.\n\nDemanding specific gifts is rude and entitled. Presenting your used stroller as a baby shower gift is also pretty rude, though.

Since it was pink and USED, it might\u2019ve been better to gift it to her prior to the shower so if she had issues with the color, you could\u2019ve come up with something together to change it.

Honestly, it does seem a bit tacky to use a hand me down for a gift for a baby shower without even asking the person. My main point was that if you think a stroller is too expensive, ask your sister if she wants your pink old one, and if she didn\u2019t, you would get her a different thing on the registry, or nothing at all.

Every parent wants the newest, best fancy stuff for their first child. Smart people also get neutral colors, brown, grey, green and the like for the giant expensive things because then you can reuse them for more children or have a much easier time selling them.

If you had asked before or after the shower? Offered it to her until she could get her own stroller? Or offered to let her use it as a spare/backup? Reasonable.

I wonder if OP is that person.....", "I\u2019ve seen this occur a few times and I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s a bad rule. Some people don\u2019t want to get 20 stuffies or 20 blankets so they set the rule so that they are likely to get things that they need. For example, a girl on my fb had a shower a few months back and she got so many stuffed animals that she ended up donating them to a hospital. She felt bad because the gifts were meant for her but she didn\u2019t have room for that many stuffed animals. \nAlthough I am also of the mind that people often gift from the heart so I personally wouldn\u2019t want to restrict that. Maybe in some cases a \u201cno stuffed animals\u201d rule is applied instead.", "can\u2019t believe i had to scroll this far down to find a NTA comment. the sister was unbelievably rude! she was rude and so weirdly entitled with the three paragraphs thing, but sure, to each their own. but how does someone react that way to a gift at a party? she wanted a stroller, op thought the hand me down might be fine, it wasn\u2019t; that\u2019s when you politely say thank you and then talk to your sister in private about how you\u2019re not actually going to use it cause you\u2019re planning on using the stroller on the registry. but thank you for the thought. like srsly being upset over gifts, especially publicly, is so rude to me", "People hate teenagers.", "I still read it in my head as \u201ceach some hole\u201d though \ud83d\ude02", "Did she ask after it was made clear to her what her sister wanted?\n\nDid she at all consider the message being sent to her sister who knows that she is struggling?

There was no reason that exchange needed to happen at the shower and especially without even asking her sister if that stroller would even work in the first place. Giving it this way traps the sister and the fact that OP- a parent herself- didn\u2019t even pause to think \u201cgee, I know strollers are a personal choice that need to fit parents lifestyle and needs. I should ask if this will work for her,\u201d and instead brought it in like sister should be sooooo grateful she now has a burden to deal with.", "By that logic, all brides and parents to be who have showers are beggars. I'm sure OP also had a shower - aka a party that solely exists to shower the parent to be with things for their baby. \n\nStrollers are also one of those things that can get banged up and pretty dirty from constant use. We don't know if this stroller was in near new condition, or if it was worn and beat up.... Just because the sister isn't in the best place financially, doesn't mean she deserves to have her own sister make a show and dance of giving her her used baby items that may or may not be in good condition. This felt more like a FU to the sister than a kind gesture.", "It's like making a big show and dance of giving someone your leftovers. \n\n_\"Oh, look at how kind I am to give you something I no longer want and would have discarded, anyway.\"_\n\nYes, it is helping someone else, but why put on a show about it? Why bring it to the shower? We also don't know what condition the stroller was in - it may have been in good condition or pretty battered. Why not ask the sister privately if she would have wanted the stroller? If it wasn't in a condition that she felt comfortable using, now she is struck with something she has no use for.", "There could be a whole list of reasons why she chose that stroller. Some strollers will only fit specific types of infant seats and many you can buy as a stroller, infant seat, and car base. So I can understand being frustrated if she was gifted a used stroller that only accepted a random infant seat that was still gonna cost me 80 to 200 dollars anyways. Then there sizing issues for a stroller and weight issues. Even more so if the stroller will convert to accommodate a toddler well, other potential children. A used stroller can be great, but a lot of people are missing just how mush hassle is involved in a stroller.", "If I ask for a Nintendo switch and someone gets me a pink one, I\u2019m not going to yell at them for it not being my favor it color. Especially considering there wasn\u2019t any indication that she went against the style she like until after. The stroller was ok the list, she gifted a stroller.", "Ha!", "I don't think she demanded a stroller! Sometimes people put expensive things on a registry in case a large group wants to pool their money, or to get a discount when they buy it themselves. It's possible she would have been fine with OP's other, smaller gifts if the stroller hadn't gotten her upset.", "Speaking as a gen z mom, brand new baby things are a waste of money imo, your baby is going to grow out of it in a flash. All my baby gifts were hand-me-downs and I found that they were practical. My baby boy doesn't give a fuck that his crib is pink, he learned to hoist himself out of the crib as soon as he could walk so we used that crib for less than a year before passing it down to someone else. Demanding brand new name brand fancy shit is entitled as fuck and I would definitely not want to hang around those kinds of parents.", "She wouldn't have been giving nothing even if she'd given the stroller on a different day--she added some other items too.", "I\u2019m sure the baby will be beside himself.", "This is the attitude that is drowning our planet in stuff, and the reason so many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.

There's nothing wrong with giving a good quality second hand gift.\n\nAre there not also rules for receiving gifts? No one is entitled to gifts so complaining about someone giving you one (especially when it was accompanied by several other gifts that were new - I guess they were also unappreciated) is rude and entitled. You either graciously accept it (and then decide whether to use it, give it away or sell it), or if it's a hassle to have it/get rid of it you politely decline the gift and buy the new version you wanted yourself. You don't go off on someone because you don't like a gift.", "This is why in addition to getting something from the registry, I usually do either a box of diapers(size 2 is the size kids are on longest), or an assortment of plain onesies in various sizes.

I wanted people to feel comfortable and know they were really wanted there. It's wasn't about what they brought and even told them gifts were not necessary. It was a celebration and no we did not have money or grandparents to buy everything.  I received lots of hand me downs, because babies outgrow everything, even some not worn. We even got 1 pair of corduroy pants from 3 families, never thought of looking down on anybody. Never acted like an entitled ass, because I have respect and class. People are too worried about the materialistic things they feel entitled to and end up pushing loved ones away. A celebration is for family and friends to come together and enjoy the event, they shouldn't have to worry if their gift was good enough or up to standards. \n\nU gave the gift with good intentions, she could've just accepted it graciously and not said anything at all.

But also a 3 year old stroller even cleaned up is a three year old stroller. Mine is not something I\u2019d gift to anyone cause it has been used to the gills.

She may have said it multiple times because she doesn\u2019t want to deal with returns, or things they can\u2019t use, or (like in my case my mother in law purposefully asks what my husbands wants I tell her sizes brands everything and she\u2019ll buy him something completely different every time) it could be so that people know to get this thing. Also, while there are many opinions about what\u2019s for a girl and what\u2019s for a boy, I know I personally had no issue with my son wearing a pink polo but I wanted his stroller to match his other things which were a mix of blues, mint, greens, grey and neutral beige. So when I added a stroller it was a graco stroller and it matched his infant car seat. It cost $80 and my nana bought it for us and it was perfect. I wouldn\u2019t have necessarily minded a hand me down stroller if it was good condition and wasn\u2019t pink. But this was kind\u2019ve pink and obviously not at all what she envisioned.

I understand if she was specific about things on her registry so that she didn't get duplicate items or clutter that she didn't have space for - be she is going to NEED a stroller. As long as it's clean and functioning then I would absolutely accept it, even if it were a temporary solution until I could afford to buy one I really wanted.\n\nYour sister is entitled, and so are most of the people commenting. I don't really understand gift registries tbh, because she chose to have a baby and shouldn't expect people to fork out a ton of money on things so that she doesn't have to.

This is like people who do gift exchanges and then ignore the list of things the person would like and buy whatever they want. You knew exactly how your sister would react and did it anyway to show everyone how entitled she is for not wanting your pink stroller. And she's right. You've decided her circumstances are bad so she can't afford to be picky. You should have waited until after the shower and if she didn't get a stroller, offered her yours.

I personally also love receiving used items and sometimes gifting them if I know the recipient will similarly love it. \n\n\nHowever if someone made a registry with very specific items and I found or already owned a similar but different item (eg. Different brand, model, different color, no car seat included because you're not supposed to re-gift or thrift those for safety reasons, etc.) then I would just ask first if they want it.
