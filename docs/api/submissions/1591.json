Fair enough.\n\nBut on the other hand, you also suck for giving her something she explicitly said she didn't want, and acting like she should be grateful since she's a charity case. And for doing it at her baby shower, of all places. You know you were square up on your high horse when you did that, sending your sister a message, which she clearly got. I mean, it sounds like she anticipated it, from what you describe as the \"three paragraphs insisting she only wanted gifts from the registry.\" Gee, wonder who that was intended for?\n\nYou literally could have bought ANYTHING ELSE on that registry and given it to her, no skin off your nose whatsoever for making her happy. Then when the time came and her stroller of choice did not manifest off the registry, offered your hand-me-down stroller as a make-do.\n\nYou get zero points for generosity if it doesn't include generosity of spirit.", "Yes it is a little entitled to ask for \u201conly from the registry\u201d.

People put stuff on a registry and want people to stick to a registry for reasons other than entitlement. (Especially if there is a wide variety of affordable to expensive items on there) For example; someone gifts them something they don\u2019t want, like a decoration for the nursery. It completely clashes with the style. Or you get them a baby monitor and they already have one. It\u2019s kind of a pain to have to worry about giving away or returning unwanted or duplicative gifts on top of being a single parent. \n\nA stroller is a nice gift and a useful one to boot. But, we live in a society with prejudices and preconceived judgments based off of appearances. And it\u2019s possible your sister doesn\u2019t want to deal with the constant: \u201coh your daughter is so cute\u201d and then having to correct people. Is it fair or right we associate colors with a gender? Probably not, but it happens. She probably should not have thrown a fit at the baby shower but without knowing more context of her fit, some of it could be misdirected hormones.

That could be something between sisters, but not a shower gift. Inappropriate. As for the pink stroller for a boy..you think it doesn't matter what color it is?

I think you just wanted to put her in her place because she was being assertive in wanting nice thi gs for her baby.", "YTA. The \"only from the registry\" could simply be because Heidi had limited space and budget and doesn't want gifts she won't use or repeat gifts.

It should have been offered to her in advance so she could decide if she wanted to leave the stroller on that she'd chosen, or after if the stroller wasn't one of the gifts purchased.

There may have been specific reasons she wanted that particular pram that she had listed on the registry - maybe how it steered, how it collapsed, how it fit in her car etc. all of which are valid reasons for wanting a specific product. If you wanted to OFFER her your pram, that should have been done out side of the event and with a discussion of \u201chey I know money is kind of tight so if no one gets you the pram you wanted, would you be happy to use my old one in the mean time?\u201d.\n\nSister - yeah the reaction to it being a \u201cgirls pram\u201d is seriously over the top. Baby doesn\u2019t care what the vehicle it\u2019s in looks like. That said I\u2019m impressed OP had one that wasn\u2019t black or grey as that seems to be the only options like 90% of the time. Sister could have graciously accepted the gift and then later after the party returned it to OP if she didn\u2019t want it. Having an argument at the party is tacky and comes off very entitled, invalidating any rational reason she may have had for wanting the other one specifically because instead she just seems ungrateful. \n\nAs for the 3 paragraphs of only get what\u2019s on the registry, I think it\u2019s actually fair. She\u2019s currently staying in a home that isn\u2019t her own, so she has limited space. At baby showers guests so often get gifts they want to give because they\u2019re cute - not gifts that are actually practical or needed. Eg, that super adorable fluffy bunny outfit? Yeah that\u2019s hand wash only and will be ruined the first time the baby spits up in it, also the baby is born in summer so by the time its cold enough to wear it the baby has grown out of it, so literally never used except for being put on for 5 minutes to take some \u201cthank you\u201d photos. A baby doesn\u2019t need the wardrobe of a runway model, and yet baby clothes galore. Bottles and dummy\u2019s? They\u2019re very much a personal preference. Toys? Child won\u2019t be playing with them for about 3-6 months so that\u2019s just taking up space. And then there\u2019s that wacky aunt who buys a bike or something in that vein not thinking about the fact it now has to be stored for 2-4 years. \nGolden rule of baby showers, get them what they ask for, if you want to get them something different ask first, and if you really want to spoil them, get them vouchers for things like cleaning, food, nappies etc. \n\nDid I feel glamours getting my best friend 3 boxes of nappies? Nope. But they sure as shit got used.", "ESH.\n\nDemanding specific gifts is rude and entitled. Presenting your used stroller as a baby shower gift is also pretty rude, though.

She is a little entitled but why in the hell do people need to embarrass others by giving them second hand gifts in public? It happens again and again.

Since it was pink and USED, it might\u2019ve been better to gift it to her prior to the shower so if she had issues with the color, you could\u2019ve come up with something together to change it. When I was 20yo, I watched my BFF buy new everything for her first kid, I even helped but she learned by the third to buy from consignment shops.

But tbh the baby shower wasn't really the place to do it.

Honestly, it does seem a bit tacky to use a hand me down for a gift for a baby shower without even asking the person. My main point was that if you think a stroller is too expensive, ask your sister if she wants your pink old one, and if she didn\u2019t, you would get her a different thing on the registry, or nothing at all.

Other people must provide her only the best\n2. She doesn't want her boy to catch the gay", "It's just as easy to say thank you for a gift and do whatever you want with it if you really dislike it!", "What's this whole \"no hand-me-downs at baby showers\" rule? \n\nI might be biased because babyshowers aren't the norm in my community but when it comes to expensive items like strollers, it is incredibly entitled to demand them, let alone brand new.", "A \"new\" stroller", "Well it\u2019s a baby shower and that\u2019s the whole point of a gift registry. Lol  \n\nSister was rude and could have told her later she was not going to use the stroller.", "Exactly, it's not difficult to be polite! \n\nBaby stuff is expensive and strollers are easily over $100, which is considerably more expensive than free.\n\nIf the sister didn't want to use it that's fine but she shouldn't have made a scene over it, who does that??", "Yeah, just because something is second hand doesn't mean its junk! I've always been grateful for hand me downs, and so have the people I've given stuff too. It gets it out of my house, into the hands of people who need them, and not in the landfill. Everyone is happy. \n\nHell, I just gave my friend's nephew a sit in toy car my daughter had outgrown. They knew it was used and were grateful and the kid loves it.", "well and she\u2019s probably naturally feeling some stress, insecurity and guilt about being able to provide for her future child. I understand what OP\u2019s sister said about just because she\u2019s struggling doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t deserve some dignity - for herself and her baby. \n\nshe\u2019s probably thinking - if she wasn\u2019t the \u2018struggling single mom sister\u2019, she wouldn\u2019t be gifted a pink hand me down stroller at her baby shower. OP wouldn\u2019t do that to a friend, or if her sister wasn\u2019t a single mom. I see where her sisters coming from , OP is the asshole", "I had two kids. Neither one popped out of the womb eschewing one color for another. Pretty sure they can't even see things clearly for at least a few weeks and don't give a shit one way or another.", "I can't stand that BS. Luckily, neither can my son.", "Info needed. \n\nWell it actually depends on the situation. Did OP mark it on the registry as purchased with the intent fully knowing you were going to give her a 4 year old used stroller that she already stated she\u2019d didn\u2019t want like you were some knight in shining armor while also cheating out of buying an actual new gift? Cuz that makes you the asshole cuz you flat out prevented anyone else from purchasing the one she wanted fully knowing that\u2019s what you were doing.  \n\nAs a parent of multiple children, I can see it from both her side and yours. Every parent wants the newest, best fancy stuff for their first child. Smart people also get neutral colors, brown, grey, green and the like for the giant expensive things because then you can reuse them for more children or have a much easier time selling them. However, when your second child comes along, hopefully you still have all that stuff or you tend to go second hand cuz it\u2019s fuggin expensive \u2026 so that\u2019s kinda where I see OP coming from. \n\nBut, if you marked it purchased on the registry and didn\u2019t actually purchase it, then you\u2019re the asshole.", "You forgot the three paragraphs of asking that they not do exactly that. Do you wonder who that was for?", "Yeah, I wouldn't apologize for giving someone something they needed and was on their registry, it just didn't \\*happen\\* to be blue.", "I got plenty of stuff off FB marketplace or for free with my 2 littles. Anything else I wanted, I bought myself.  I don\u2019t hesitate to contribute to to registries for those who are in a bad way and have preferences. It\u2019s likely the last time they will get what they ask for.", "I'm just so blown away by people getting that worked up about 'girls' things and 'boys' things. The baby literally does not give one iota of a crap for the longest time. If it's a free stroller that works, there you have it.", "Well, I don't think OP has much of a case for saying the rose gold pink stroller for the boy doesn't matter, since she bought the thing for her own daughter. \n\nSo apparently she can have girl things for her girl baby, because she got pregnant the correct way, but her sister should be happy with whatever she gets because she's a skanky single mom whose babydaddy ran off. Which is a message that does not need to be conveyed at the baby shower, if at all.", "You\u2019re totally right. I was trying to assume the best in Heidi, but you\u2019re right that the sentiment is in itself very rude and she should\u2019ve kept it to herself.", "I guess people do baby showers differently in different places! They're less of a gift grab here and more of a celebration of the fact that a baby is coming. I would never say multiple times in an invite that I would ONLY be taking things off the registry, nor would I even demand that anyone bring me a present. So rude.", "The thing about higher ticket items is that, it's not so much of a gift grab as it is an opportunity for, say, a group of people to chip in together on a higher-priced necessity. It's not tasteless to have an expensive thing on a registry, as long as the registry isn't 100% expensive things.", "This is all just me guessing but probably because some people don't want to reuse stuff from someone else's baby. They want something new for their baby because it makes its more special. \n\nAsking for a stroller is definitely strange to me tho I have only been to one baby shower and barely remember it.", "Not a rule but a custom in a lot of places, in my experience. But registries and very common (and helpful) and are certainly not demands. I have given and received presents not on a registry and it's always been great, so I don't think the sister handled it well *at all* and was certainly rude. However, in my middle-aged experience family and friends give hand me downs over the course of a pregnancy but not at showers.", "I don\u2019t see the problem with giving a hand me down to her at any other time than the shower. Literally before or after the guests are there.\n\nAt the same time, the entitlement of saying \u201conly items on the registry\u201d repeatedly is pretty icky.", "It\u2019s the whole everything is perfect instagram world.  She already probably feels stressed and judged about the father abandoning her so when this stroller comes in it just reinforces that she is poor and her baby won\u2019t get nice things and she needs charity from her sister just to get buy.  And this is done in front of all her friends. \n\nI don\u2019t see her as demanding a stroller as long as there were other more reasonably priced items on her registry.", "I would be so embarrassed if a child of mine ever behaved like that over a gift that anyone got them. It's the thought that counts, and OP put thought into it. Here was a free stroller that worked perfectly well, it just didn't happen to be the color Heidi so wanted. It isn't like the color has any weight against whether or not an item works. Put a blue blanket in the stroller if it's so freaking important.", "My stroller was 1600\n\nThey are expensive here in Australia!!", "And in the US it's hard to get rid of baby stuff for liability reasons. Lots of thrift stores won't take it. Sharing these items among friends and family (and strangers!) should be celebrated, not treated as embarrassing.", "Did you give it to them as a gift or just a hammy down that you didn\u2019t need anymore.", "My mum was gifted blue baby clothes and only had me - a girl. I'm 62 now and I can't say that the experience of wearing blue scarred me.", "Exactly.", "It\u2019s not a matter of whether the baby knows. It\u2019s more often a matter of parents not wanting to face \u201cOh what a lovely little girl!\u201d \u201cThank you, but he\u2019s a boy,\u201d for the millionth time.", "Right? The more I read Reddit the more I appreciate my parents. They didn't care about any of these non-issues.", "Or maybe she had a pink stroller and other items were blue and holy crap who gives a damn if the thing is safe and rolls?", "All of this.", "r/choosingbeggars", "That's not the message I got at all. It was \"Strollers are very expensive, I probably can't afford a brand new one for her. Here is a free one that is is good condition, it just happens to be dusty pink.\"", "Same! I think that's very rude as well.", "Baby showers are 100% gift grabs", "Uffda. I've owned cars cheaper than that. Hope that stroller had 4WD and heated seats.", "Exactly!  I just see it as taking care of the community, not embarrassing someone or making them feel less than me.", "It was a gift. Wrapped it for his birthday", "I am giggling so hard about that. Both my daughters wore and wear clothes that are traditionally masculine. It hasn't come up in therapy or anything. We just like Ninja Turtles.", "I'm always surprised at how much people care. I knew someone who had kids just about two years apart. She registered for a brand new pack and play, high chair, stroller, the works. Stuff she already had that was in perfectly fine condition. Because the first set was 'girly' and she was having a boy!\n\nNo one bought those big ticket items for her second baby.", "A lot of people do. God forbid people have preferences. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I personally think things like gender reveals are stupid as hell. It's like, no shit, your baby is a boy or a girl, we were hoping it was a dragon egg. /s\n\nBut let's not pretend that nobody identified with their baby by its gender before, until OP's sister came along. Obviously TONS of people, perhaps even a majority of people, do exactly that. People are allowed to enjoy things, even if they're basic.", "Well, Exhibit A, OP's first two sentences: \n\n>Heidi is pregnant and the baby is due very soon. The father broke up with her as soon as he found out she was pregnant and she had to move back in with our parents.\n\nAnd Exhibit B, the sentence of what her sister said: \n\n> She said that just because she's struggling doesn't mean I get to take away her dignity.\n\nI think OP's post has judgy vibes and the sister knows what's up. OP could have offered that stroller at any other time besides the shower itself, and it may have actually come off as sincere. Doing it for an audience? Major side-eye. What if the sister's friends had actually bought the stroller off the registry?", "It does have 4wd and all terrain yes. Also can be modified to carry up to 3 kids and should also last 10 years \n\nPlan was to buy a quality one that will last through all pregnancies", "I really think a lot of it is homophobia. They don't want \"feminine\" boys. And apparently that happens if they sit in a stroller of the wrong color (eye roll).", "If baffles me people thinking like that. I'm working on making my registry for my first child - and am leaning towards cool colors because I love them. Like my boy will be fine in the purple carseat I picked out - if I have a girl later she'll be good in the blue stroller. It's especially confusing because there are so many gender neutral colors and options.. if you are going to be that finicky about it then go greens, black, gray, white. Like there are options? Why go with colors knowing you're only going to use it for one gender..", "Of course people can have preferences, but that doesn't mean they are always going to get exactly what they want. That's why people are calling her \"entitled.\"", "If you want to be picky, buy it yourself, holy shit.", "Then she would have had two strollers? Then she could have had one to fold up in the car and one to leave at the house for walks? We've done that before so we weren't constantly packing and unpacking strollers, which can be a major PITA. Or maybe she would have found she liked one stroller better than the other for certain activities? \n\nOr Heidi could have just said \"Thanks!\" and gotten rid of the stroller afterwards. There was no reason to have a big screaming fit. I don't think OP is being judgy, I think she's pointing out Heidi isn't in a place to be picky-choosy and she's doing that. Example: Saying multiple times she ONLY wanted items off the registry.", "We don't know that there was a stroller on the registry, but if there was, OP could have seen if it had been bought or not. Also, many people do not have a couple hundred dollars to spend on a new stroller. I don't get \"judgy\" from the quotes you pulled. The first is just explaining that Heidi cannot support herself or her child right now and the second is really a quote from Heidi.", "Yeah, I don't get it at all. I once tried to give someone a free sippy cup because the only one she had for her son got melted in the dishwasher. \n\nShe turned it down. Why? \"It's piiiink!\" Okay, well, good luck with no sippy then.", "This. If you're so choosy that you can't possibly get anything that's not on the registry, then buy it yourself. If there's only one stroller in the whole world you want, then you should buy it yourself and a baby bathtub and bibs on the registry.", ">One of the gifts on the registry was a stroller, which I know can get quite expensive.\n\nETA: Which is kind of strange for OP to even say it like that, because...it's a registry. They have prices. OP knows how much the stroller was. WAS it even expensive?", "Thanks. Somehow I skipped that line both times I read it!", "I'm here for ya! I dunno, I have sisters. I am also a sister. \"I was just innocently doing this\" is not an indicator of a reliable narrator, just saying.\n\nThis is not to say that, in a different situation, giving the sister the stroller wouldn't have been perfectly nice. But doing it in exactly the way that OP's sister requested it not be done? Something is rotten in the state of Denmark."]}
