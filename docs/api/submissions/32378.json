When my sister got back from the bathroom she said congrats to me and had stopped crying but she still looked pissed and was just sitting with her arms crossed. I told her to leave and that she was selfish, she has three healthy kids and needs to get over it now. She was pissed and took her gift with her and my mom said I need more empathy for my sister and that it\u2019s been really hard for her to give up her dream.

All this wanting and hoping for a specific gender only shows how people have this idealized notion of what their child will be like and what parenthood will be like.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your sister and her selfishness hurt you and diminished your celebration.

It was not the time nor the place for your sister to do this. She has a right to her valid emotions, but she could have congratulated you (if possible for her at the moment) and quietly left the party so she could deal with her disappointment and resentment. \n\nInstead, the behavior was likely noticed by other guests, as well as you, about the situation. Plus, as this occurred with other family and friends, this has likely opened the door for her sons to find out this reaction in the future.  I am sure that she loves and adores them, but knowing your mother was crushed that none of them turned out to be a girl could be really hurtful.\n\nYour mom should have realized that both of her daughters were hurt by this, and she should have been more empathetic towards you as well as your sister.", "So\u2026.just checking: she turned up to an event with a 50% chance that it would go a certain way?

If it really was just emotions she would have cried and then put on a happy face or left . Instead she sat there and pouted and crossed her arms like an infant. It\u2019s not acceptable to behave this way at a celebration for your sister. Gender disappointment is real for your own baby but throwing a fit bc your sister got a girl and you didn\u2019t is wierd. Why not just love and shop for that baby girl. The emphasis on how much she wanted a girl is wierd. I feel bad for her kids.", "Sorry the hear that you are only views as number 2.\nThat sucks.\nYou should just talk with your mother (not the sister she is lost cause) just express how it makes you feel. \nIf she is not listening to what you have to say tell her you are disappointed, that you thoughts a mother role was to love and care for both children equally. Normally it should trigger some reaction...\nCongrats for your baby.\nNTA", "Info: we\u2019re your nephews present?\n\nNTA either way but if they saw mom have a melt down bc she doesn\u2019t have a girl they are going to internalize that.", "YTA  A gender reveal?

We\u2019ve all had weird, possibly hormonal, days where something took us by surprise. A good hostess can deflect and distract and get parties back on track even if a guest goes rogue. Instead it sounds like you made the rest of the party as much about her as she did. If her motives were selfish, you gave her exactly what she wanted: attention and martyrdom. \n\nAs for not being congratulated by your mother, that\u2019s a bit sad, and probably reopened the wounds all siblings have over ideas that their parents have a preferred child. However, the lady already has several grandkids and has years to say lovely things about this one, and one of her kids was actively in distress. \n\nJust on a personal note that I know most people don\u2019t share, this recent, self-centered gender-reveal trend baffles me. As if we\u2019re all supposed to care what a baby\u2019s genitals look like. As if we\u2019re all supposed to say \u201cthank goodness, now the child will enjoy baseball/ballet\u201d like those stereotypes aren\u2019t completely ridiculous and outdated. They give me the ick, as if these parents wouldn\u2019t be supportive if their kid\u2019s interests or personality went against gender norms. Because we all know what \u201cI want a kid I can play ponies and do makeup with\u201d means\u2026 and doesn\u2019t mean.", "Nah. \n\n\nYou are entitled to feel annoyed and your sister is allowed to be emotional about something you don\u2019t and won\u2019t ever understand. \n\n\nIt annoys me when people judge gender disappointment about being what you have. It\u2019s actually not it\u2019s about what don\u2019t and won\u2019t ever have. \n\nIt\u2019s actually not ok to judge someone else for their feelings.\n\nWhat is ok is to judge her for those feelings effecting your happy day. \n\nShe should have kept her shit together.\n\nBut it\u2019s not as easy as just getting over it for her either.", "YTA \n\n\n>when it was announced we were having a baby girl my sister burst into tears.\n\n\nSo do you believe this was a genuine reaction or fake?

Hell, she *did* congratulate you, but apparently not quickly enough to your liking.\n\nYTA for making a big deal of this.\n\nI mean I do think your sisters reaction is over the top as well but why do you care so much? It's just a gender reveal.\n\nI say this as a dad of two children.", "ESH for being a family more obsessed with baby genders than having a healthy baby.\n\nYour sister is worse for continuing to experiment breeding for preferred gendered babies, but you holding a gender reveal is also bizarre too. \n\nA baby is a blessing and their genitals are not important unless the child has health issues relating to said genitals and requires medical attention relating to it.\n\nPeople with fertility issues, miscarriages, stillbirths and child deaths would do anything to have a happy, healthy child regardless of gender. Your family need to sort out your priorities.", "Unfortunately i can see both sides here - i know how heartbreaking it can be to not be able to have a girl and watch everyone around you having girls (but loving your boys unconditionally) - in some ways YTA ... She's obviously still struggling with it but wanted to be there to support you regardless - maybe if you already knew or suspected the gender you could have given her a heads up", "YTA\n\nAlthough it was a surprise to everyone else, **you**, OP, knew what the gender was going to be in advance, and yet still you went ahead with the gender reveal party full knowing your sister's history.\n\nIf you had the least bit of sensitivity towards your sister, you would have warned her well in advance. At best she would have got over the shock in time for the party and then been in good spirits; at worst you could have uninvited her beforehand so she didn't make a scene on the day.", "No, it was a tantrum, taking over a meaningful occasion at which you are a guest and making it about you, creating a scene, getting your mommy to rush over and tend to you, making your emotions more important than everyone else\u2019s and taking back a gift as you leave - all parts of a massive tantrum", "NTA. Some of us just want one living child and she has three that apparently aren't good enough because they're a certain gender.", "NTA at all. Your sister is acting like a little kid, your own childs gender shouldn't matter. Congrats on your little baby girl, i hope you and the baby are healthy!", "ESH \n\nShe should\u2019ve been prepared for you to be having a girl and having that reaction is not appropriate imo. \n\nHowever, telling someone to grow up/etc while they\u2019re in a flooded state does nothing but piss them off. To me it sounds like your sister was flooded, you were flooded, and everyone reacted out of immediate emotions, not out of love and compassion for each other. Not out of true thoughts. If you spoke to her kindly at first, she responded inappropriately, and then you told her that she\u2019s being selfish, I\u2019ll change my answer. \n\nI hope your sister logically knows she has three happy healthy children and is happy with that. I think envy is still okay, because it\u2019s a gut reaction with no control. Letting it dictate your life is a different story, hence her definitely being an asshole. Needing to step out to collect, good. Still being pissy when back, asshole behavior.", "YTA - Why didn't you give her a heads up and it sounds as if she tried to pull herself together but you then kicked her out.", "YTA \n\n\nIf you read any of the baby subreddits, gender disappointment is real, and people have bad reactions at their own gender reveal parties. \n\n\nShe reacted stronger than she would have liked, left to the bathroom, and then composed herself and said congratulations.", "Youre both assholes.  I get having hopes for your child but life happens and you have three lovely children, gender doesn\u2019t matter.

How must her sons feel knowing that Mom had a breakdown over the fact that having them is apparently not enough for her because they happened to be born a certain way? \n\nOP is NTA.
