Sure, you can say parents are \"people\" all you like, but that easily flows right into the simple fact that by cheating the parent can reveal that they were not as capable of love, kindness, or honesty as they portrayed themselves to be. They weren't perfect, they were flawed, and unfortunately those flaws were nasty.\n\nTo make a long story short, no OP. You're NTA, because you're dealing with this bullshit as much as your father is. Your mother is trying to fake like things are normal and is failing to take accountability for her actions.
