She should understand breaking the trust of her marriage would also include her children as well", "NTA \n\nShe's lucky your speaking to her \n\nRespect is earned \n\nYou don't have to have contact with her \n\nShe obviously didn't care about how it would impact you", "Ask her where her love and respect were when she cheated and broke up the family. \n\nNTA.", ". My sperm donor was a piece of work and I switched to calling him by his first name when I was about 14? Maybe 15. He hated it and said some of the same stuff. Disrespectful, rude blah blah blah. So I stopped talking to him altogether. Like I literally didn\u2019t say a word to him for months. I want no contact as soon as I was able at 17. You are NTA.", "Respect and love are things that are earned, not granted automatically. When you cheat on your spouse when you have kids, you cheat on everybody. You betray everybody. So you, as the betrayed party, are entitled to be angry and to not respect your mother. If your mother wants to rebuild that trust, she's going to have to work for it.\n\nNTA", "Bless... NTA.\n\nThis is a classic form of teenager rebellion. And while, imo, *most* teenagers are inherently AHs, you're in an unpleasant situation and this is your way of having control over something in a situation that makes you feel *out* of control.\n\nWhen you're older, you'll realize not all adults or parents are deserving of love and respect. Cheating aside, I can't say for sure if your mom is one of those people or not (if your little sister thinks calling her by her first name is too far, I am inclined to assume this is a relatively suburban family dynamic... I have friends who *wish* the worse thing their kids did was call them by their first name).\n\nYou're being intentionally disrespectful as a way to bring attention to how you feel about your relationship with your mom, not throwing chairs through the living room window or torturing neighborhood pets. Tell *effin' Deborah* she can go sit on a flim flammin' potato, gosh darnit.", "Has she been otherwise a good mother? Are you certain you know enough about your parents marriage that all fault definitely lies with her? It's not a very mature response- people are complex and make mistakes and I presume she still loves and takes care of you.", "NTA. \"Mom\" and \"Dad\" are not titles that must be given because a couple of people decided to have sex. Parents are people that, by word and example show a child the socially responsible way to live and behave. Not all biological parents have earned that moniker, and many non biological parents have. You have the right to decide for yourself who you bestow with your own personal love and respect. IMO, you have no obligation here.", "Nta. Honestly everyone has morals and ethics. If someone goes against mine I'm just civil. It does not matter blood at all.", "NTA. If she broke your family's trust then she can't get sympathy back.", "INFO: is the change from mom to name the only change in how you address and speak to her?", "NTA\n\nIf you don't want to have a relationship with your mom, you don't need to. She has a first name for that reason.", "NTA. Respect is earned, not owed by relation. She can't expect her behavior and the break up of your parents marriage not to have a serious negative impact on both your life and your relationship with her. Stick to your guns until she stops copping the \"we're still a happy family, nothing has changed\" nonsense.", "NTA\n\nYou could tell her that she's lucky you call her at all.  And it sounds like that may well stop in no more than two years.  It would be funny if it weren't so insulting that she's demanding respect from you after destroying your family and hurting the people you love.  You wouldn't tolerate a stranger stabbing your father in the back, so her trusted role makes it extra terrible.", "NTA. She broke up the family and your are entitled to be angry with her. Showing your contempt by taking the title \"mom\" away from her is quite mild. It's a lot less harsh than calling her names reserved for adulterous women or cutting her out of your life entirely.", "NYA Your 16 you have the right to not see her if you don't want.", "NTA. \nPeople who forget to treat their SOs and children with love and respect and end up cheating are expecting love and respect.

Maybe there were reasons you know nothing about \nIn the end, you will hurt yourself if you hold onto this pain and estrangement with your mother.  \nDid she blow up your family when she was caught?  Yes. \nIs she still your mother who loves you?  \nAlso yes \nBoth things can be true", "YTA, though I feel for you.  You're going through a really tough spot, and your mother appears to be the main cause of it.\n\nHere's where I think you're going wrong, though.  \"Respect\" means two different things.  One type of respect is personal respect for someone's accomplishments or deeds.  Doesn't look like Ma is going to get a lot of that.  The other kind of respect is ... let's call it \"social respect\".  That is, someone's position in society.  Think judges, or teachers, or priests.  They may be jerks or immoral, but their position demands a certain level of civility.  Likewise your mother, who did after all birth you and take care of you, deserves that level of social respect.  Especially when you live under her authority, ahem.\n\nSo yeah, call her Ma or Mom or Mother or whatever; that's basic civility.  Doesn't mean you have to admire her character.  Calling her by first name is a direct provocation.  In your position, that's probably a bad idea.", "NTA tell her that you don't respect her, she doesn't deserve respect. She didn't just cheat and ruin her marriage, she ruined the family unit, it was more important to be with someone else than it was to RESPECT her family. She made her choice, she can live with the consequences.", "I called my mother by her first name. To me, the title mom implies some form of love & respect. I had neither for mine.  So if I had to refer to her, it was her first name only.", "NTA. Ask your mom why she cheated on your dad and why she should get any forgiveness? I'm sorry you have to deal with this.", "NTA. You get what you give, and she hasn't exactly been passing out love and respect.", "YTA. She supports your life. If you don\u2019t want a relationship, only stay with your dad. While yeah cheating is bad, maybe that was the best option for her. You can\u2019t judge her for her own decisions and it sucks but you kinda just have to deal with it. Ask that she gets no custody of you. Make you father parent you full time since you want him more. You should look deeper at this issue and see if there are reasons for her to do such a thing and maybe have some empathy. No one\u2019s perfect and you probably aren\u2019t either. I understand the anger but it\u2019s not really your place to be angry", "YTA. Parents are human and you\u2019re being disrespectful.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
