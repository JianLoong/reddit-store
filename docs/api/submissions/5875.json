It takes a little research but that'd be a little more thoughtful than just cheaping out on Bath and Body Works (which I know from personal experience gives some ppl headaches)", "NTA\nThere was an expectation here that you would get each other specific gifts so yeah you're right to feel peeved", "NTA. Simply, he snaked you.", "NTA.  Shower gel is the cheapest body care item they sell-- did he even give you a three wick, or did he scrimp further with a bitty single wick?  With sales, he probably spent about $20 to $30 max, probably far less.  And he expected, no *demanded,* gratitude?  He is TA here.", "NTA, it seems there was at least an implied agreement that you would get each other the gifts you each asked for. You upheld your end of the bargain, he did not. He did however teach you a valuable lesson.", "NTA. \n\nMy opinion... he doesn't care what you want and probably never will. He did what was easy for him to do.  Why?  Because he comes first.", "NTA, your not even married but he can't be bothered to put in the same effort as you in the relationship, I'd be reevaluating your future with him, editing to add, he literally got you basic soap for Christmas, shit you buy yourself as a basic necessity for daily life and from what I googled bath and body works costs like 2 to 3 dollars right now, this man doesn't give a fuck about this relationship", "NTA. One thing was if;\n -  you didn't give him a list\n - his one wish was at the same price as the gift he gave you\n - he was new at relationships or bad at gifts, and you didn't give him a wish\n\nHe's most definetely the asshole. Who wishes for something expensive and gifts the person something cheap?? Sorry but maybe you should reflect whether there's any other red flags. He seems very selfish. Gifts may be his one flaw but somehow I doubt it.", "NTA because you had both shared lists, so like others said it was implied you\u2019d get the exact things you both wanted.", "NTA it seems he didn\u2019t care what you wanted", "NTA", "NTA. If he can't afford to spend $100 on you, he shouldn't be requesting a $100 gift from you. If he can afford it, then he really just doesn't care what you want.", "NTA, you got him exactly what he wanted.  Because you made the effort.  He did not, and is shocked that you're upset.  *You wanted him to give the same amount of effort you gave in his gift.*  It's the emotional labor of making it a point to go and find where its sold, getting the exact right one, etc etc.  He didn't want to do that, so he just popped into the mall and grabbed the first display he saw.", "NTA. He broke the understanding. But I hope he enjoys the books. It\u2019s nice to get thoughtful gifts. If it happens again,get him socks or pajamas and see how he feels.", "NTA. I'm sure he would have been \"ungrateful\" too if you went and got him a completely different random book instead of the one he wanted.", "Return his and get yours NTA", "NTA - It sounds like you clearly communicated what you wanted as a gift and your boyfriend chose not to get it for you. Instead, he got you something that doesn't match your request and doesn't seem to have much thought put into it. It's understandable that you would be disappointed and feel like he didn't make an effort to get you what you wanted. It's not unreasonable to expect that a gift given in a relationship should be something that the recipient actually wants and will appreciate.", "NTA mainly because I don't get people that go 'close enough' when it comes to gifts and expect people to not notice. If what someone asks for is ourside of your planned budget manage their expectations, don't agree to get it. \n\n*\"Sorry, I've looked up that thing you wanted and I can't afford that right now, is there something else you wanted or another model/type you would be interested in?\"*\n\nI read a similar one about a specific appliance someone had researched and wanted, just to open one they had heard was not suitable for them.\n\nI get money issues if it was that but if he didn't have the budget for actual perfume, he shouldn't have asked for a $100 set of books from you. It was implied you would both get specific gifts and he didn't honour his end.", "I remember the year I got dollar store construction paper(I'm a semi-professional artist) for Xmas after being asked for a $300 game system. NTA but I'd personally end a relationship over that. He asked for $100+ and only gave you, what, $30? Yea, that would never happen again.\n\nFor me, it was inlaws who did this so im able to go petty. Now I get them something off their list and something cheap. The cheap one goes under the tree and the list item stays behind until I find out what they got me. If they cheaped out again, I just return their big gift without them knowing. If they got off of my list, i just go \"oh, wait, i forgot your other gift in the car\". This year I got a small pack of store brand coffee and cookies. They got a $10 body wash set in a scent I don't like. I returned the popcorn maker already.", "I would have given the gift back to him and say he should give it to his mum. I used To get these types of gifts all the time at one point I think I had a box full of them (6) and couldn\u2019t use them as they make me feel nauseous. I ended up taking the box into work and let people take what they wanted from it.", "INFO:  What are his finances like and how long have you been together?\n\nBeing ungrateful typically ain\u2019t a vibe, but there\u2019s a certain level of tacky gifting that can override this.", "INFO: How did you react to when he gave you the gift?

I suppose you could get him lesser generic things for the next few occasions so that he could learn a lesson and you could each be resentful, but wouldn\u2019t it be nicer to try and find someone who will match your level of consideration?\n\nIf you want to stay with him you can explain how you feel and see if it sounds like he understands, but if he\u2019s at all defensive or doesn\u2019t get it this is pretty much what you can expect from this relationship.", "NTA- He's cheap and you told him what to get you. Smh.", "NTA You are in that period of dating where your bf is putting in maximum effort before he gets lazy and stops trying. So if this is all he can do you can really see how low a priority you are. But he's certainly making a maximum effort to get as much from you as he can. He is 'mining' you with very little outlay. Reduce your 'outlay' accordingly and start pulling back so you can give this guy a better examination without your rose tinted glasses on.", "NTA. He sounds ridiculous. What was his explanation for not getting you anything off your list?", "NTA. I'm sure he wouldn't have been happy with any old piece of reading material either.", "ESH. If two two people expect specific gifts (of similar value) from each other, then they should just buy the gifts themselves.  Or give each other money. There\u2019s no sentiment if you expect a certain gift. If there\u2019s no thought put into buying the gifts then you\u2019re basically just trading stuff. Omit the needless exchange, and buy yourself the gift.  There\u2019s no shame in doing this. Not everyone is sentimental. If gifts aren\u2019t a way that you show affection and appreciation, then don\u2019t exchange gifts. You can show your love in other ways.", "NAH - I feel like if you guys have a budget of $100 it is possible that he might have been low on money for him to buy something less than what you wanted", "Yup.   I wanted a specific type of perfume but knew it was way outside of our present budget. My  husband did a load of research and surprised me with a bottle of a different perfume with a very similar smell (but was much cheaper and in line with our budget)\nI was so touched by the effort he put into it, it meant more than anything else.", "This.

I made my request after he asked for said gift.", "I think my face dropped, I felt like crying.

You found yourself a good one!", "Yeah I get why you're disappointed and I've felt it before as well. I can see how its super frustrating considering you told him exactly what to get you. \n\nMy partner and I don't really do the gift thing. Little things here and there sometime but honestly its just material items, ya know? We can afford to get whatever we want on our own. What's important is that we love each other and show our love everyday. \n\nIf you feel loved by him and he shows it in other ways try to take this with a grain of salt and know that dudes can be kind of dense when it comes to gifts and everyone has a different love language.", "I\u2019m with you on this one.

You shell out for what he wants and he buys you a generic gift that was nowhere near what you want then wants gratitude?

It doesn\u2019t even say that he asked for the books as a gift, only that he has been looking for and talking about the books. From what she writes, we don\u2019t know that the boyfriend knew what his gift was going to be.  Then she specifically asked for a specific gift.  If there was an agreement then she didn\u2019t mention it.", "? It very clearly says they both asked for specific gifts in the first paragraph. Its in the first line even."]}
