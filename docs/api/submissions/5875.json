Simply, he snaked you.", "NTA.  Shower gel is the cheapest body care item they sell-- did he even give you a three wick, or did he scrimp further with a bitty single wick?  With sales, he probably spent about $20 to $30 max, probably far less.  And he expected, no *demanded,* gratitude?  He is TA here.", "NTA, it seems there was at least an implied agreement that you would get each other the gifts you each asked for. You upheld your end of the bargain, he did not. He did however teach you a valuable lesson.", "NTA. \n\nMy opinion... he doesn't care what you want and probably never will. He did what was easy for him to do.  Why?  Because he comes first.", "NTA, your not even married but he can't be bothered to put in the same effort as you in the relationship, I'd be reevaluating your future with him, editing to add, he literally got you basic soap for Christmas, shit you buy yourself as a basic necessity for daily life and from what I googled bath and body works costs like 2 to 3 dollars right now, this man doesn't give a fuck about this relationship", "NTA.

He did not, and is shocked that you're upset.  *You wanted him to give the same amount of effort you gave in his gift.*  It's the emotional labor of making it a point to go and find where its sold, getting the exact right one, etc etc.  He didn't want to do that, so he just popped into the mall and grabbed the first display he saw.", "NTA. He broke the understanding. But I hope he enjoys the books. It\u2019s nice to get thoughtful gifts. If it happens again,get him socks or pajamas and see how he feels.", "NTA.

If they cheaped out again, I just return their big gift without them knowing. If they got off of my list, i just go \"oh, wait, i forgot your other gift in the car\".

I'm just saying like those are the only two even semi plausible ways for this to play out as somewhat acceptable in my mind. Namely because there was a point where my bf (now husband) had me looking for certain colognes that he couldn't find (\"because I internet better than he does\" his quote not mine) and they were sold out/ discontinued and I was able to find them and also some of the dupes for them but we talked about it first to make sure that it was acceptable.

The problem is that it wasn't worth for him to make you happy. \n\nThat he didn't even feel bad to hand out this gift when he get 100$ books should show you that he thinks more about himself and also has not really respect about you.
