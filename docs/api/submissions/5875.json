Perhaps if he'd given you a thoughtful gift it would be different, Bath and Body Works is the kind of gift you give to a co-worker you know the bare minimum about...", "NTA you told him exactly what you wanted, at a price that would match what you got him (which was exactly what he wanted).  He cut corners and cheaped out, and disregarded your choices.  That's a bigger problem.", "NTA\n\nPlease don't live in his margins or eat the crumbs he has tossed you.\n\nYou listened to him and made his Christmas wish come true. He could not be bothered. He should be ashamed knowing how much you spent and the thought that you put into his gift.\n\nFrankly, I would have clocked him upside the head with the candle. But that is me. It is why I am currently taking a time out from dating.\n\nedited for clarity", "NTA\n\nWhen a person shows you who they are, believe them.\n\nYour bf just showed you who he is, so you should believe him.  He did not listen to you, did not consider you, and probably waited until the last moment and then went out and got something from that store and thinks it is ok.\n\nSo it is conversation and maybe couples counseling, or planning an exit from the relationship.  Course the way he is thinking he will spin this to make himself the victim and only think of himself.", "NTA but this is how he\u2019ll treat you the whole relationship. It\u2019s about him and what\u2019s easiest for him", "Why even bother buying each other gifts at that point?\nIdk if your the TA but your doing Christmas wrong.", "If he couldn\u2019t afford it he shouldn\u2019t have asked for an equally expensive gift!", "Bath and bodywork\u2019s have also been running wicked before Christmas sales! They had their shower gels for $4 and their 3 wick candles for $10. Not sure if that\u2019s when he got them but the lack of effort on his behalf is astonishing.", "Next level shit right here. Thanks, this is the advice I didn\u2019t know I needed.", "You seem cool tbh. In laws are missing out", "NTA...My husband went shopping for my Christmas gift at the local comic book store.  With regards to my gift, he came home empty handed...but bought himself over $100 worth of books.  He still hasn't \"found\" me anything...yes, it is after Christmas.   Last year he bought me a hat for my birthday because he thought I would \"look cute in it\".  I thought I would look cuter in a new car...so I went out and bought one while he was on a business trip.  (we both work)", "Oh crap. You are correct. I bet his mom even did the shopping.", "What?! He brought a lovely, smelly votive candle to the table. Very festive. /s", "According to OP he could. Its why I said hypothetically.", "Some essential oils can trigger migraines in certain people! It is often inherited - my mum & I get triggered by vanilla. Someone once gave me a lavender & vanilla pillow spray and\u2026well, it didn\u2019t help", "Go forth and be petty", "I said the same thing! I went when soaps were $2.95, lotions and body washes $3.95, candles $9.95, and sanitizers $1! They also had minis for $2.95 often. They had great deals this year for stockings and little gifts!", "Asshole doesn't do him justice and is an insult to actual assholes", "Do you have the link to this? It seems super interesting. Sorry to go off topic a bit, but I got my daughter (12f) a Clinique Happy dupe for her stocking and I couldn\u2019t tell the difference.", "Sure, I was just meaning that if he hypothetically couldn\u2019t afford it, then he should have set the expectations on his gift lower. But I think we are all agreed, he is both cheap *and* thoughtless. A real prize!", "Lavender is horrible for that!", "My daughter uses those smelly plug ins. I mever stay as long as we'd all like cuz I don't like migraines. Hm Maybe she uses them on purpose", "What did they get you last year? Loving this for you \ud83d\ude02", "To the perfume? No because I think they stopped selling it. To the doc? I think it was a show on the BBC. If I find it I'll come back and link it below this comment.", "Lol for sure. Seems like he's trying to give a non committal gift (something cheap) instead of something meaningful or something she wants", "Lol do you reckon my mom also doesn't want me at home then? I've let her know I hate that candle and she keeps lighting it \ud83d\ude33", "My Little Pony calender. I'm 33.", "I can only suggest discussion.  \"Honey, do you realize how bad it makes me feel when I point out exactly what I would like, when I give you a picture and the brand name and the size... and you ignore me?\" \n\nMaybe it would be best to not dwell on the gift but rather on the fact of how being ignore makes you feel.\n\nGood luck. And these days I just tell my mom I don't want anything. She gives me a check equal to what she gave my brother.", "Yes, the documentary. That would be awesome, thank you. Maybe I can google it since it may have been on BBC.", "Jfc, that's awful. At least you got a new sound system...", "Are you serious?", "So\u2026. Why don\u2019t you dump him? If you stopped driving him. Would he even come see you?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like he is willing to spend any money on you, put any effort into your relationship.\n\nHow long do you want to drag this deadweight? He has made it clear he isn\u2019t going to be picking up any slack", "Yeah it was a show where they talked about Lidl and Aldi and how they do like cheaper copies of expensive name brands. The one that stood out to me was that Chanel dupe because that's a big name", "When my goddaughter was little(nearly a decade ago), she was into mlp so I spent alot of time drawing ponies for her. Apparently they assumed that meant that I was super into it.", "You should have gotten him a dictionary. It has all the words in the books he wanted so there\u2019s no difference. NTA", "NTA, he didn\u2019t listen to you when you told him exactly what to do.", "NTA I was gonna say yeah you are until you actually told me that you told him exactly what to get and he told you exactly what to get instead of following your agreement he decided he was gonna get something cheaper", "NTA It's the thought that counts, and there was NO thought put into that.", "Depends - it sounded like he believed he was putting in a good effort for what you wanted. Sometimes men need more direction of what you want. You gave him a list which made him believe it was an idea list rather than it-has-to-be-on-this list or else. \n\nIf you feel like he did it because he's just cheap and doesn't care then you can be angry. But I'd bet he tried.", "NTA.     \nYour boyfriend is tho. He cheaped out on your gift.", "Nta. He got lazy and cheap.", "NTA.. just try to state it without drama. \"Thanks for your gift. I admit I was hoping for what I had asked for because I thought that is what we were doing. That is why I got you exactly what you asked for\"", "You just got super used. Return the books and throw him a 20 to make up for your gift and dump him.", "Honestly break up with him and take the gift back from him when you leave. You could even replace it with some cheap book from the thrift shop with a note inside the cover telling him how grateful you\u2019ll always be for the lesson he taught you.\n\nNTA", "Yta\n\nAre you people serious? It's Christmas.  Grow up.", "$30? That\u2019s laughable.\n\nIt would be difficult to spend more than $10 on the items the boyfriend bought.", "Perfume also gives a lot of people migraines too.  Honestly wearing perfume kinda says \u201cI don\u2019t care if anyone near me in public gets a migraine from my perfume.\u201d", "Trust me, the replica perfumes, etc. are not the same at all.", "Not a he first display he saw \u2014 the cheapest, most discounted display he saw first. \n\nIf he had walked into Nordstrom\u2019s and bought a different perfume because they were out of the one she asked for, that would be one thing. What he did is so much worse.", "I second this.", "Bought a $100 gift for their partner, got a cheap, thoughtless gift from their partner. Warrants feeling hurt and exploited.", "You don't ask someone for a $100 gift knowing your budget for them is a fraction of that. Not someone you love, anyway.", "Say what?", "They were $15 each, got one for each of them. I'd prefer the $10 sets but my husband says I need to at least pretend to be nice for Christmas hahaha. It's our compromise.", "I get a rash from any of their body products.", "Are you stuck because of kids?", "Why on earth should you be grateful that he put absolutely no thought or care at all into your gift when you went out of your way to make sure he got the exact thing he's been dreaming of? That's just shitty all around. Find a MAN that appreciated you and reciprocates the effort you're putting in. NTA.\n\nETA: Are you even reading what you're typing here? It's there anything at all that he brings to this relationship, or any actual reason you like him? Because he sounds like a horrible partner.", "I would love to test these people who argue that you shouldn\u2019t be ungrateful for any gift. Next holiday, give them a $1 ashtray from Salvation Army and see how grateful he is. Or maybe a stack of the 10/$1 books from the thrift store since he must like any book, right?!", "I feel this is load of crap. \n\nThis guy didn\u2019t have to guess at what she wanted because she told him. He knew it was roughly the same price as the gift he requested. Yet, he chose to go to a different store and buy something cheap that she didn\u2019t want. He didn\u2019t care about making her happy, he cared about putting himself first. \n\nHe\u2019s pushing boundaries and trying to see what he can get away with in the relationship. The more she tries to make excuses, the worse the relationship will become. It\u2019s already headed in a bad direction when one partner starts to play these games. If she accepts this as the status quo, it will just encourage him to stop putting in effort in other parts of the relationship until she\u2019s a complete doormat and he loses respect for her.", "Plus, this \"love language\" bullshit was invented by an evangelical preacher to convince heterosexual married women to stay with (and appreciate) their neglectful husbands. \n\nSo, no.", "Your partner is allowed to ask for an expensive gift from you and get you a cheap, thoughtless gift for the same occasion, but it indicates the partner doesn't care about you and warrants feeling hurt and exploited.", "Might be time to rethink this relationship...."]}
