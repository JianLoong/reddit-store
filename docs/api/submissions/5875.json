It takes a little research but that'd be a little more thoughtful than just cheaping out on Bath and Body Works (which I know from personal experience gives some ppl headaches)", "NTA\nThere was an expectation here that you would get each other specific gifts so yeah you're right to feel peeved", "NTA. Simply, he snaked you.", "NTA.  Shower gel is the cheapest body care item they sell-- did he even give you a three wick, or did he scrimp further with a bitty single wick?  With sales, he probably spent about $20 to $30 max, probably far less.  And he expected, no *demanded,* gratitude?  He is TA here.", "NTA, it seems there was at least an implied agreement that you would get each other the gifts you each asked for. You upheld your end of the bargain, he did not. He did however teach you a valuable lesson.", "NTA. \n\nMy opinion... he doesn't care what you want and probably never will. He did what was easy for him to do.  Why?  Because he comes first.", "NTA, your not even married but he can't be bothered to put in the same effort as you in the relationship, I'd be reevaluating your future with him, editing to add, he literally got you basic soap for Christmas, shit you buy yourself as a basic necessity for daily life and from what I googled bath and body works costs like 2 to 3 dollars right now, this man doesn't give a fuck about this relationship", "NTA. One thing was if;\n -  you didn't give him a list\n - his one wish was at the same price as the gift he gave you\n - he was new at relationships or bad at gifts, and you didn't give him a wish\n\nHe's most definetely the asshole. Who wishes for something expensive and gifts the person something cheap?? Sorry but maybe you should reflect whether there's any other red flags. He seems very selfish. Gifts may be his one flaw but somehow I doubt it.", "NTA because you had both shared lists, so like others said it was implied you\u2019d get the exact things you both wanted.", "NTA it seems he didn\u2019t care what you wanted", "NTA", "NTA. If he can't afford to spend $100 on you, he shouldn't be requesting a $100 gift from you. If he can afford it, then he really just doesn't care what you want.", "NTA, you got him exactly what he wanted.  Because you made the effort.  He did not, and is shocked that you're upset.  *You wanted him to give the same amount of effort you gave in his gift.*  It's the emotional labor of making it a point to go and find where its sold, getting the exact right one, etc etc.  He didn't want to do that, so he just popped into the mall and grabbed the first display he saw.", "NTA. He broke the understanding. But I hope he enjoys the books. It\u2019s nice to get thoughtful gifts. If it happens again,get him socks or pajamas and see how he feels.", "NTA. I'm sure he would have been \"ungrateful\" too if you went and got him a completely different random book instead of the one he wanted.", "Return his and get yours NTA", "NTA - It sounds like you clearly communicated what you wanted as a gift and your boyfriend chose not to get it for you. Instead, he got you something that doesn't match your request and doesn't seem to have much thought put into it. It's understandable that you would be disappointed and feel like he didn't make an effort to get you what you wanted. It's not unreasonable to expect that a gift given in a relationship should be something that the recipient actually wants and will appreciate.", "NTA mainly because I don't get people that go 'close enough' when it comes to gifts and expect people to not notice. If what someone asks for is ourside of your planned budget manage their expectations, don't agree to get it. \n\n*\"Sorry, I've looked up that thing you wanted and I can't afford that right now, is there something else you wanted or another model/type you would be interested in?\"*\n\nI read a similar one about a specific appliance someone had researched and wanted, just to open one they had heard was not suitable for them.\n\nI get money issues if it was that but if he didn't have the budget for actual perfume, he shouldn't have asked for a $100 set of books from you. It was implied you would both get specific gifts and he didn't honour his end.", "I remember the year I got dollar store construction paper(I'm a semi-professional artist) for Xmas after being asked for a $300 game system. NTA but I'd personally end a relationship over that. He asked for $100+ and only gave you, what, $30? Yea, that would never happen again.\n\nFor me, it was inlaws who did this so im able to go petty. Now I get them something off their list and something cheap. The cheap one goes under the tree and the list item stays behind until I find out what they got me. If they cheaped out again, I just return their big gift without them knowing. If they got off of my list, i just go \"oh, wait, i forgot your other gift in the car\". This year I got a small pack of store brand coffee and cookies. They got a $10 body wash set in a scent I don't like. I returned the popcorn maker already.", "I would have given the gift back to him and say he should give it to his mum. I used To get these types of gifts all the time at one point I think I had a box full of them (6) and couldn\u2019t use them as they make me feel nauseous. I ended up taking the box into work and let people take what they wanted from it.", "INFO:  What are his finances like and how long have you been together?\n\nBeing ungrateful typically ain\u2019t a vibe, but there\u2019s a certain level of tacky gifting that can override this.", "INFO: How did you react to when he gave you the gift?

I suppose you could get him lesser generic things for the next few occasions so that he could learn a lesson and you could each be resentful, but wouldn\u2019t it be nicer to try and find someone who will match your level of consideration?\n\nIf you want to stay with him you can explain how you feel and see if it sounds like he understands, but if he\u2019s at all defensive or doesn\u2019t get it this is pretty much what you can expect from this relationship.", "NTA- He's cheap and you told him what to get you. Smh.", "NTA You are in that period of dating where your bf is putting in maximum effort before he gets lazy and stops trying. So if this is all he can do you can really see how low a priority you are. But he's certainly making a maximum effort to get as much from you as he can. He is 'mining' you with very little outlay. Reduce your 'outlay' accordingly and start pulling back so you can give this guy a better examination without your rose tinted glasses on.", "NTA. He sounds ridiculous. What was his explanation for not getting you anything off your list?", "NTA. I'm sure he wouldn't have been happy with any old piece of reading material either.", "ESH. If two two people expect specific gifts (of similar value) from each other, then they should just buy the gifts themselves.  Or give each other money. There\u2019s no sentiment if you expect a certain gift. If there\u2019s no thought put into buying the gifts then you\u2019re basically just trading stuff. Omit the needless exchange, and buy yourself the gift.  There\u2019s no shame in doing this. Not everyone is sentimental. If gifts aren\u2019t a way that you show affection and appreciation, then don\u2019t exchange gifts. You can show your love in other ways.", "NAH - I feel like if you guys have a budget of $100 it is possible that he might have been low on money for him to buy something less than what you wanted", "Yup.   I wanted a specific type of perfume but knew it was way outside of our present budget.

I can see how its super frustrating considering you told him exactly what to get you. \n\nMy partner and I don't really do the gift thing. Little things here and there sometime but honestly its just material items, ya know? We can afford to get whatever we want on our own.

Specific perfume has something in it that he's allergic to/causes him issues when worn around him. \nIn my opinion both of those could have been solved with simple communication.\nOtherwise I don't see how it would make sense to just not get what was asked for.", "ALT fragrances is the fucking best for this.

Get out before he takes more of your valuable time and energy. NTA", "What a load of crap. Op mentioned in another comment he generally pays when they go out on dates. So she spent a little more on one gift while he regularly spends more throughout the year.", "This is such an elaborate set of hoops to jump through but I love the dedication to reciprocity.", "One hopes he has...", "It was a game of thrones leather edition book set", "He has a higher paying job than mine and better finances. $100 would not be that significant to him. He gets his sister a more expensive gift than that at Christmas", "She gave him more than one. He would never find it at Bath and Body Works. My dermatologist said to never use their products.", "3. He waited until the last minute and couldn't find what she asked for anywhere he could get it in-store or have it delivered in time, so he went to the mall and got the closest thing he could find\n\n4. He's short on money this month\n\nEither way, his \"gift\" should come with an apology and a promise that he'll make it up to OP ASAP.", "I watched a short little doc about how Aldi replicated a Chanel perfume and how nobody could tell the difference because they basically hired a master perfumier. I find that stuff fascinating. \n\nAlso well done!", "It's not going to get better.\n\nNTA", "Yeah. He cheaped out. With the pre Christmas sales, your gift was probably $20.", "To be fair,  we kept the sound system and movie set for ourselves last year. Can't deny they've got good taste lol", "That's a great gift for someone who's into he series. It sucks that he couldn't reciprocate. Seems like he doesn't really make an effort to listen to you. He just got the gist of what you were saying and took the easy route.", "How are the finances handled normally in your relationship? Do you split bills 50/50? Dates?", "Yeah I know she gave him multiples, and I agree on the bath and body works thing as well. I'm just saying like those are the only two even semi plausible ways for this to play out as somewhat acceptable in my mind. Namely because there was a point where my bf (now husband) had me looking for certain colognes that he couldn't find (\"because I internet better than he does\" his quote not mine) and they were sold out/ discontinued and I was able to find them and also some of the dupes for them but we talked about it first to make sure that it was acceptable. And again with the ingredient thing, my husband is allergic to artificial coconut so I can't use my tropical stuff anymore because it literally makes it hard for him to breathe. But again that's something that could have also been solved with a conversation. \n\nBut I do really want to know what went through his head and how he thought doing this was ok. (Which imo it's not ok and I'd have probably already started picking the relationship apart wondering where, if, or how else he's done this or similar things in other areas of our relationship etc)", "Yeah I guess those are possibilities too. Idk I feel like anything I can come up with could have easily been resolved with upfront communication so it's still OP is NTA in any possible scenario. And he for sure owes her a sincere apology and explanation.", "We don't pay bills together. I pay for my own place...and he lives for free at his parents house..typically he offers to pay on dates", "Ah, thanks for the clarification.", "So you\u2019re upset that you spent more one time on a Christmas gift, but have no problem with him spending more when you go out on dates? Do I have that correct?"]}
