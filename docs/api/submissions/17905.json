When I did, I moved into a student apartment (7 bedrooms) with 6 other roommates I had never met. One of the girls and I got along fantastically. The rest were different. At the beginning of the year, I told them I enjoy cleaning and that I was comfortable handling most of the shared spaces as long as people contributed by taking out the trash and wiping down counters after cooking (these were the only two requests). We developed a system to hold accountability for trash and everyday cleaning. Everyone claimed they were satisfied. Prior to April, there were issues. EVERYONE (apart from the one I get along with) refused to take out the trash and allowed it to overflow to the point it covered our kitchen. I begged for help in the group chat constantly. I was also very clear from day one, considering I was the only one who bought anything for the kitchen, that people were allowed to use my items as long as they respected them.  Finally, one of our roommates in April started misusing my kitchen items. This roommate started leaving stains impossible to get off of all my cooking supplies and breaking handles on pots while drunk. She also started throwing major house parties that were every night. At one point 10 nights in a row, and I was left to clean all of it up. Sometimes it would take 6 hours to clean up from nightly parties. Then, at one of the parties, her boyfriend smashed all of my wine glasses for comedic effect. No one cleaned it up. I posted in our group chat that I was no longer comfortable with anyone using the items I had purchased for shared spaces, which was close to everything, because of the mistreatment. EVERYONE was up in arms. They told me I was a horrible person who had no business withholding items from them that they need to use. I feel awful, but no matter what I've said in the past, people refuse to be respectful of the space and my purchased items. I understand money is tight for all students, but it is for me too, and I have to protect the stuff I purchased, along with my time.

People typically don\u2019t care about things if they don\u2019t own or have paid towards it. \n\nWatch out you\u2019ll end up losing your bond over their behaviour and from what I see, they\u2019re taking you for granted, or even worse, they know you\u2019ll clean up like a unpaid maid so they\u2019re not cleaning because you\u2019ll do it.", "NTA. Until you can get out of that living arrangement, don\u2019t replace anything that\u2019s broken or damaged. And yes, pack up your good stuff and let them do without.  It\u2019s easier for the mediocre roommates to be pissy at you than at the roommate who has gone off the deep end with her destructive behavior.", "NTA, but I'd look out for this the next time you share a house with other people. By being all \"I enjoy cleaning, also here's all my stuff for you to use\", you're setting yourself up to be the mom of the house, and then it's really easy for others to see your things and your labour as common goods that they're just entitled to.\n\nAnd yes, this is a shitty way to behave from the others, and I'm not trying to excuse that. I'm just saying that this is a pattern that is very likely to repeat intthe future if you keep taking more than your share of responsibilities (including the responsibility of being the one who initiates planning and reminds others of their chores).", "NTA. And make an official bill about the wineclasses and demand compensation.", "NTA. Sounds like they lost their privileges to use your things. Maybe it's time to try to find a new living situation.", "NTA at all, and I'm really sorry. All the people living there should be responsible for cleaning, and if someone makes a mess it should be automatic to clean it!! I don't understand why they're so surprised that you don't want them to use your things anymore, if they're just destroying it. Your roommates sound very selfish and hard to live with.", "\"So i'm horrible because i withold my stuff from you After you broke most of it, but it's not horrible break my glasses, my stuff, never clean, never take out the trash, never clean etc. Right?\"\n\nNTA", "NTA, they are disrespecting you and the items you allow them to use. When they break them, send them the bill to replace them. If they can't act like adults they won't be allowed to use your stuff. As for the cleaning, I'd now tell them you are only cleaning up after yourself and they have to do their fair share. They are taking advantage of you by throwing parties and not cleaning up the mess because they know you will do it. Taking out the trash takes less than 5 minutes of their time, they are just being lazy.", "NTA- they won\u2019t change though. I had a similar roomate argument 7 years ago when I packed up all my kitchen stuff due to broken, dirty, or rusted items of mine after countless discussions. Was called many names for it. Guess what though, you aren\u2019t their mom and you aren\u2019t responsible for their lack of money\u2026sounds like a \u201cthem problem\u201d. I would point that out next argument and stand your ground.\nThe audacity of purposely breaking your wine glasses and not at least replacing them\u2026", "Ugh, why don't people in a shared space take out the garbage?!??! It baffles me. It's not that hard lol", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThey are spoiled college students who need to buy their own kitchen supplies.", "Please don't take this the wrong way but these people are using you as a doormat. You need to adjust your ideas of you're prepared to do for other people, especially\n- people you have no connection with or obligation to\n- people you don't like\n- people who treat you like dirt\n\nI highly recommend you find somewhere else to live, if possible, and figure out what boundaries to draw in your new environment. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, but you also need to stiffen your spine and stop letting people take advantage of you. It doesn't gain you friends, only leeches who will suck you dry. Clean your things and your spaces and keep them as separate as possible from your roomies.", "NTA. \n\nDuring my second year of college, my 3 roommates and I moved to campus housing that had a kitchen. I bought all of the pots/pans/plates, etc.   I said everyone was free to use the stuff as long as they cleaned it. \n\nOne roommate in particular cooked often and never cleaned the my equipment. It was irritating having to clean them before I could cook anything. \n\nI tried just letting things go and he would come to my room and tell me I have to clean the dishes\u2026it got to the point where it was a contest of wills and there was mold all over the pots and pans in the sink.  \n\nHe then approached me and said if I didn\u2019t clean the moldy pots he would be throwing shit away because he needed to use the sink. I told him he was the last one to use all of the equipment so he should clean them. He said they were mine, so I should clean them regardless of who used them. \n\nThe conversation ended and about 10 minutes later I heard the clatter of pots and pans, so I went to the kitchen to see if he was cleaning them.  He wasn\u2019t; he was moving them into a garbage bag to throw out. \n\nSo I took the bag off of him and clean the pots and pans and said he\u2019s never t use them again.  \n\nAt that point I kept all of my kitchen shit in my room. He would STILL, after all of that, ask to use them often, and I would always tell him no. \n\nFrom that point he switched to microwave meals and disposable utensil/plates/bowls.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
