She lied to you.  That is hard to come back from.  I would withhold the college fund for now, but make it possible for her to earn it back.  I wouldn't let her have any direct access, I would pay the bills myself (if she did earn your trust back enough to let her use it for college).", "NTA\n\nShe isn't sorry for doing anything, she is just sorry she was caught. Moving apartments and keeping it quiet is a very deliberate and conscious act.\n\nBut at the end of the day its still your daughter, so no one can tell you whether you should continue to pay or not.\n\nDo you an to put that money aside for her for anything in the future? Eg help to buy a house or wedding etc?", "NTA. She needs to learn some integrity before you give her anything else.", "Your not wrong, but I\u2019m not sure your right either. 19 is not really an adult. Most have no experience in life and get caught up in the excitement of things. Mistakes happen\u2026\u2026 I am just curious if this is the hill you want to d** on. You could lose your relationship with you daughter over her making mistakes. Another commenter said something like have her pay for a semester, if she does well then you should start back up again. \nWere you the only one to contribute to the college fund? Did any one else?", "NTA. She used your money that you were giving her for a purpose that you did not approve of, she then lied to you about dropping out of college, not being able to visit because she lived in a student dorm, and I\u2019m sure there was other lies told to protect the big lies. \nShe is 19. This wasn\u2019t just a small \u2018mistake\u2019 a child makes. A lot of teenagers take our student loans to pay for college, sadly, it\u2019s life. She has a job that can also support her for personal expenses.", "NTA\n\nShe lied and stole from you in the process. Not even lied or stole just once, this went on for awhile and the only reason you found out is because one of her friends messed up. With the weight of consequences looming over a person some will do or say just about anything to be relieved. \n\nIs the ex a parent to Sally? If so, maybe they can fund her education.\n\nLetting up right away before Sally even feels the full weight of her actions won\u2019t let her learn a thing. Maybe if she does prove that she is willing to do the work to fix what was broken, then some help from you may be appropriate. I don\u2019t think she needs to be told this because she may just end up doing the bare minimum until you start paying again, if you went that route. May be an option though if she does back up her words with action.\n\nShe will have to learn at sometime that lying and stealing is not appropriate behaviour. Under other circumstances she could face punishment by a system that doesn\u2019t care about her feelings and would make it even harder to move ahead in life.", "Let her prove herself first. She can go back on her own dime, show she's willing to work for it and produce good grades, and THEN you can consider funding school again but keep a very close eye on her progress.

Forgive when you can. Even if it takes years. Even if you never. You have to be sincere..\nIf you reconsider your stance for others.

If after a semester or two you see she is being responsible, you can offer the tuition payments at the time they are due. \n\nPoint is, you are justified in withdrawing support, but if you are considering resuming support she needs at least two semesters to prove herself first.", "Info: I'm assuming that you had a discussion stating that the money was to be used to pay for room and board and tuition?", "NTA this wasn\u2019t a mistake, she made choice not to use the money for school.

Now on top of this, she would have also just went to keep on doing it without you even knowing if not for that friend of hers slipping that litte detail. \n\nSo she squandered all that fund on nothing substantial, dropped off college and has the audacity to cry about getting cut off from the one who she basically stole money from? The absolute entitlement is shocking. That money was clearly set up for a certain purpose and she misused it for trivial luxuries that will be gone in a moment, rather than using it as the investment into her future that it was.\n\nDon\u2019t budge OP. Her actions have consequences and it literally doesn\u2019t matter that she feels bad. She needs to learn that as an adult in real life, she needs to bail herself out of situations she put herself in.

She\u2019s trying to manipulate you into continuing to fund her lifestyle.

I think she needs to show you she wants college, so expecting her to work for this and prove to you that she's serious about it would not be unreasonable. She's 19, has done something stupid, but she does need to learn a lesson here - she essentially scammed you!\n\nI think you do need to talk to her and find out why she dropped out. Was it the wrong course for her? Was she struggling? Was working and studying too much? Or was she just being a dumb 19 year old? You need to know, either way.", "NTA. But cue all the posts insisting she is just a child who didn\u2019t know better and made a mistake.", "NTA. If your ex thinks Sally should still have her college paid for, your ex can pay.", "Nta. You were scammed by your own daughter. She needs to pay back every cent she scammed out of you. Until she does that - don't give her a thing.", "NTA.

You have other children, focus on them she is an adult and can learn that actions have consequences.", "NTA and if your ex thinks you're too harsh then they can pay for your daughter's college.", "Maybe unpopular, but\u2026 NTA.\n\nIn my opinion, her actions can definitely be described as a huge breach in trust.  The money was for tuition. But she dropped out and wanted to imitate that Carrie Bradshaw lifestyle. Well, the kid gotta do it on her own now.", "Nta.  This a fuck around and find out.\n\n She fucked around and lied, now she finds out her consequences", "She maintained a deception for financial gain over a period of time, not just a day or two.

If the money came from something like a 529 plan, she may have tax implications for using it on non college related expenses too.", "Info: who contributed to the college fund?\n\nIf anyone other than yourself contributed, YTA. If it was just you, NTA, but you could still use the fund to support her education without freely giving her full access to it. You could direct pay for tuition.", "I'm going to say ESH.\n\nSally for obvious reasons, but I do think you're being too harsh on her - she's your daughter, and she made a mistake. Did she ever want to go to college to begin with, or did she feel pressurized? How long will you hold a grudge? She's only 19, while yes that's an adult, she was probably caught up in the moment but is now realizing what she did was extremely wrong. If she does want to go back to college, and you refuse to fund her, you're actively harming her future and she may not want a relationship with you for that. At the end of the day, it really comes down to whether you want your daughter in your life or not.", "NTA- it\u2019s your money and clearly she was dishonest about how she was using it. However, if she\u2019s serious about not messing around and you really do want to pay for her tuition, you can do that. It\u2019s called direct pay and you can set it up with the registrar\u2019s office. My parents funded my college education and that\u2019s exactly how they did it.", "NTA She is 19, she should understand that her actions have consequences.", "NTA\n\nA mistake would be failing a class and not telling you.\n\nDropping out entirely and moving to a fancy apt, that is a conscious choice that she made.\n\nShe is only crying now because she got caught.", "Info: is this money already set aside for her education (like a prepaid plan) or are you paying it out of pocket as you go? Also, how much did she blow through on other than education expenses?\n\nI\u2019m leaning NTA, but would also advise that you still want her to be successful in the job market - if for no other reason than that you won\u2019t have to continue to support her. Maybe pay the tuition directly?", "NTA.  Your daughter lied, wasted money you saved for her education.  She's shown she can't be trusted, she's not sorry for what she's done. She's sorry she got caught.  What did she think was going to happen?  It's time to pay the piper. Instead of having her education paid for, she now has to pay for it herself.", "Nta. She didn't just quit school. She stole your money to fund her preferred lifestyle. If her friend hadn't let it slip you could have been paying for years.", "This is probably the most sane solutions I have read here. NTA", "This is a good solution, the daughter gets to have consequences for her actions but also parental support and love after proving herself.", "Agreed. Let her pay for a semester. If she does so, and successfully completes the term, the next one OP could cover.", "Mistakes happen. But you don't just happen to rent a luxury apartment, come up with lies to cover up what you did, and only stop when you are caught. That is more than a mistake.", "I'm also a bit unsure here. 19 is not a mature adult sure and most of them get excited by the freedom that comes with it. But 19 is also old enough to know responsibilities and follow through. \n\nWhile I agree that what she did was wrong, I'm just curious if there are other underlying reasons why she dropped out. Is she having problems in school and couldn't tell her parents?", "A mistake is a 12 year old swiping a candy bar. His 19 year old daughter stole and lied multiple times--this was not a momentary lapse in judgement. Now it's on her to find a way to pay for college if she's truly had a change of heart. He could always reimburse her for some of the tuition if she actually sticks with it this time. Having college paid for is a huge privilege and she blew it.", "You\u2019ve got to be joking. What would you consider a reasonable consequence for lying and stealing from the family?", "Happy Cake Day!", "That\u2019s a 19 year old who probably has a sheltered life, with zero taught life experience and ,without a doubt from what it sounds like ,peer pressure.  She lied and that is terrible and consequences absolutely should be established. But would you want someone hold something that you did at 19 against to the point it could affect your whole life.", "NTA.\n\nThis was not, as your ex said, a 'mistake'.\n\nThis was your daughter deliberately defrauding you out of whats likely to have been tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe fact that you're only not going to pay her tuition going forward is honestly not far enough in my book.", "NTA\n\nDropping out of school, moving out of studen housing into an expensive apartment and buying luxury items aren\u2019t mistakes but active choices that she continued to make on a daily basis.\n\nShe isn\u2019t sorry for or regretting her choices. She\u2019s sorry she got caught and is using crocodile tears in order to have you fund her elaborate lifestyle. If your ex is so convinced that your daughter should go back to college, perhaps your ex should fund it.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your ex instantly backs out of the idea.\n\nYour daughter scammed you and stole your money. She\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t report her for theft.", "She didn\u2019t realize her mistake.\n\nShe committed fraud and got caught.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nSorry, Sally is an adult (a young one but still an adult) and she had the capabilities to find and rent a luxury apartment and lie for months to you and keep this secret, so there was no mistake to \"realize\" other than being upset she got caught. \n\nThe reality is she woke up every day and chose to lie to you and steal your money (since the fund wasn't going to it's intended purpose). Just being like \"you got me, go back to school kid\" would be a dramatic underreaction to a young adult who created a very elaborate scheme. \n\nShe won't die by taking out loans, there are plenty of trade school options, community colleges and state schools that are affordable, and of course loans plus a part time job makes a lot of places manageable. You aren't setting her up for success in life by letting her get away with this situation, where she placed no value on the truth, on her education, or on money.", "NTA. She\u2019s sorry because she got found out.", "NTA and your ex can fund Sally's studies if she is so hell bent on the daughter not taking student loans.\n\nIf Sally is truly sorry you could reconsider paying her tuition fees but transferring it to the school right away instead of giving your daughter accesz to the money. However, You are totally in your right not to do so.\n\nThat being said I'm quite shocked you didn't check everything with where your daughter lives or so. My parents were definitely more involved and the only thing they paid for was my health insurance (EU citizen) and I actually took loans for 2 studies and a post bachelor for a total of 7 years...", "NTA play stupid games win stupid prizes.", "NTA nothing says you can't pay off the loans once she finishes her degree. Then if she drops out again you didn't lose any money and if she finishes it would be a nice surprise for her. \n\nOr you can tell her you will pay the loans off once completed, but then you might run into the issue of Sally taking out a bigger student loan than she needs.", "NTA. If it was me I'd only forgive if she got her shit together, got a job, went back to school, and took out loans. Once she proved to me that she is capable and asked for forgiveness without being an AH about it I'd pay off her loans and rebuild from there.", "NTA This wasn\u2019t a mistake, but a conscious series of choices. Now she has consequences for those choices. \n\nBut if you or your spouse do decide to eventually help her return, I would pay the school directly next time.", "I don't think it's harsh but if she really wants to go back to college can you not pay her college fees direct to the institution or student dorms as opposed to giving it her? At least that way you know the moneys going where its supposed to", "NTA", "You\u2019re NTA but I think you need to find a way to get her back on track. \n\nMaybe she takes a year off school and works full time. Once she\u2019s saved X amount of money that she will use towards tuition you will pay the rest. You can also insist that you be added as an authorized user on all her school accounts. Then you would be able to see if tuition was paid and see what classes she\u2019s enrolled in as well as her grades. Beyond that I would also want her to show you a budget for all expenses each semester. And you can make it clear that your financial support will be reevaluated each semester.", "NTA at all. The way I see it this is a lesson that is needed to continue to raise her into a productive member of society. It\u2019s good parenting.", "NTA.  Let her take out loans to cover everything and if she graduates consider paying them off from the college fund.", "NTA. How you respond to this really depends on what you want the outcome to be. If you just want to punish her, then cutting her off completely is the right action. If you want to help set her up for a better life, then addressing the issue more directly will yield better results. The reality is, she\u2019ll likely hate you (in the short term at least) for either option.\n\nBut if you take the second route, Sally needs to understand it\u2019s not just about the money; she\u2019s broken your trust. If she wants access to her college fund, ask her to agree to the following steps:\n- She gets a full time job until she has paid you back in full for the money she mis-used. \n- Once that is done, you will release her college fund, but she will not have access to the money herself. You will pay the college directly. \n- she will provide you with her grades each semester. If she is failing classes or is not able to provide her grades, the money stops. \n- If she doesn\u2019t want to go to uni but wants to pursue alternate education, same deal. \n- If the money is not used for education it is void. This is not her money to spend as she wants. \n\nShe needs to accept conditions on receiving the fund now. And she needs to do some serious work on rebuilding your trust. Any more lies and the money stops.", "NTA.  She essentially stole tens of thousands of dollars from you. \n\n\nYou absolutely don't owe her anything at this point, and you are N T A if you don't pay more.\n\n\nBut, realistically, if you have the money to spare, taking loans and such start her off at a big disadvantage. Interest on student loans is absolutely insane and people end up spending tens of thousands of dollars on interest alone. \n\n\nIf you can afford it, maybe offer to pay again, but you pay everything DIRECTLY to the school. \n\n\nMaybe make a contract for her to pay you back with significantly less interest than through formal loans. \n\n\nThere are ways to help her without giving her the same carte blanche.", "Nta", "NTA. She lied. These are the repercussions.  My sister fucked around as a freshman away in college. When she came home the deal was - she pay for the semester. If her grades were a certain standard (C or higher)she would be reimbursed for the semester. \n\nIt solves the issues. She goes to school, you don\u2019t pay a dime unless she\u2019s in school and performs academically.", "Nta, if you find it in your heart to pay half later then pay the school directly.

I have a daughter getting close to that age, and college has only become more expensive since I attended. That's a *LOT* of money to be blowing on a \"fancy vacation\" instead of school, and to do it by lying about it... nope. I'd have cut her off too.

It\u2019s for EDUCATION something that broadens your opportunities dramatically. It\u2019s also not a right but a gift/gesture. \n\nDo not give her the money. She F*d around and found out.

Either she's v selfish and short-sighted, which I think is the assumption most people are making here, or something else. Did she quit school or did she drop out?
