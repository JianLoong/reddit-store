Abusing that privilege rescinded that privilege. Expensive lesson.", "NTA. She lied and used your money to fund her lifestyle. To avoid any chance of regret or guilt you may feel later on you could always keep that money in an account until you've calmed down a little, should you decide to give her another chance, but I don't think you're under any obligation to do so.", "NTA.  She lied to you.  That is hard to come back from.  I would withhold the college fund for now, but make it possible for her to earn it back.  I wouldn't let her have any direct access, I would pay the bills myself (if she did earn your trust back enough to let her use it for college).", "NTA\n\nShe isn't sorry for doing anything, she is just sorry she was caught. Moving apartments and keeping it quiet is a very deliberate and conscious act.\n\nBut at the end of the day its still your daughter, so no one can tell you whether you should continue to pay or not.\n\nDo you an to put that money aside for her for anything in the future? Eg help to buy a house or wedding etc?", "NTA. She needs to learn some integrity before you give her anything else.", "Your not wrong, but I\u2019m not sure your right either. 19 is not really an adult. Most have no experience in life and get caught up in the excitement of things. Mistakes happen\u2026\u2026 I am just curious if this is the hill you want to d** on. You could lose your relationship with you daughter over her making mistakes. Another commenter said something like have her pay for a semester, if she does well then you should start back up again. \nWere you the only one to contribute to the college fund? Did any one else?", "NTA. She used your money that you were giving her for a purpose that you did not approve of, she then lied to you about dropping out of college, not being able to visit because she lived in a student dorm, and I\u2019m sure there was other lies told to protect the big lies. \nShe is 19. This wasn\u2019t just a small \u2018mistake\u2019 a child makes. A lot of teenagers take our student loans to pay for college, sadly, it\u2019s life. She has a job that can also support her for personal expenses.", "NTA\n\nShe lied and stole from you in the process. Not even lied or stole just once, this went on for awhile and the only reason you found out is because one of her friends messed up. With the weight of consequences looming over a person some will do or say just about anything to be relieved. \n\nIs the ex a parent to Sally? If so, maybe they can fund her education.\n\nLetting up right away before Sally even feels the full weight of her actions won\u2019t let her learn a thing. Maybe if she does prove that she is willing to do the work to fix what was broken, then some help from you may be appropriate. I don\u2019t think she needs to be told this because she may just end up doing the bare minimum until you start paying again, if you went that route. May be an option though if she does back up her words with action.\n\nShe will have to learn at sometime that lying and stealing is not appropriate behaviour. Under other circumstances she could face punishment by a system that doesn\u2019t care about her feelings and would make it even harder to move ahead in life.", "Let her prove herself first. She can go back on her own dime, show she's willing to work for it and produce good grades, and THEN you can consider funding school again but keep a very close eye on her progress. I would make having access to grades mandatory, as she already has shown you she can't be trusted.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  It wasn't a lie.  It was a carefully assembled deception from a person who should have been grateful for the life you have provided for her.   Sally is an asshole who should not receive any financial aid ever again.", "Nta. \nSis and ex's\n I see were there coming from. But not rn.  They were not the ones betrayed like that. They just want everything to go back to normal.. n hate seeing her sad. They are \nstanding in the way of here learning some hard truths of the world. \n\nYou should wait till you are ready. Forgive when you can. Even if it takes years. Even if you never. You have to be sincere..\nIf you reconsider your stance for others. Resentment will follow you.\n\nIt takes away the possibility of your daughter showing you how much you mean to her. From her own actions.\nYou need to see it.", "NTA. She didn't just use the money selfishly, she also specifically lied to you to cover it up. She knew she was wrong.\n\nThat said, perhaps she can redeem herself? Take out loans and work to actually put herself through school, and upon graduation you could use what money is left to pay off those loans (well, minus the money she already wasted)? Obviously up to you, but if she truly takes this as a lesson and plays it straight, that could really get her back on the track you'd hoped she'd take.", " NTA. She used your money for something she knew you wouldn\u2019t approve of. Otherwise she\u2019d have told you about her move. She took gross advantage of your generosity.", "NTA. That isn\u2019t an \u201coops\u201d, that was a calculated deception.", "NTA learned that honesty from her mother or from you? Let her learn the hard way that the world doesn\u2019t support liars.", "**NTA** -  and she is lucky you are not requiring her to pay you back for the \u201ccollege funds\u201d she spent on her apt and luxury goods.  \n\nHaving gotten a free ride by deceiving you, she can now live with the consequences and learn a good life lesson by earning her own way.", "NTA, you gave her money for specific purpose, going to college and she wasted, lied to you.\n\nIf she wants to back to college, then she has take some responsibilities, such as taking out loans. It decides to go back, make clear what you will pay for, tuition or school fees, course equip which she proof to you-that is paid directly to college snd she can get loans and work for living costs", "NTA. If you have a soft spot in your heart, tell her that if she pays her way through college then you will give her the equivalent of the tuition at her graduation. If after a semester or two you see she is being responsible, you can offer the tuition payments at the time they are due. \n\nPoint is, you are justified in withdrawing support, but if you are considering resuming support she needs at least two semesters to prove herself first.", "Info: I'm assuming that you had a discussion stating that the money was to be used to pay for room and board and tuition?", "NTA this wasn\u2019t a mistake, she made choice not to use the money for school. I wouldn\u2019t give her another dime.", "NTA. There are scholarships, FAFSA, paid internships, and part time jobs. You worked hard for her to attend college and she took advantage. Now, she gets to see how it is in the real world when you fuck around.", "NTA, but I would consider a compromise: directly pay her tuition, and don't give her any money directly evwr again.", "NTA.\n\nShe misused her college fund not once (a single mistake), but over a longer time which is active deception on her part. Now on top of this, she would have also just went to keep on doing it without you even knowing if not for that friend of hers slipping that litte detail. \n\nSo she squandered all that fund on nothing substantial, dropped off college and has the audacity to cry about getting cut off from the one who she basically stole money from? The absolute entitlement is shocking. That money was clearly set up for a certain purpose and she misused it for trivial luxuries that will be gone in a moment, rather than using it as the investment into her future that it was.\n\nDon\u2019t budge OP. Her actions have consequences and it literally doesn\u2019t matter that she feels bad. She needs to learn that as an adult in real life, she needs to bail herself out of situations she put herself in. And still giving her money for her to go back to uni won\u2019t help her in any other way besides \u201cdad will bail me out, he has money\u201d.", "While the trust has been broken, you may be better off getting her to earn your trust back with you (moving back to dorms, selling off the luxury items, paying back the misused funds, etc) instead of what could essentially put your daughter into a completely different life situation (different work life and options for the rest of her life) over a youthful mistake.\nNTA yet, but could be.", "The crying and promises are pretty obviously  just because she got caught misusing your money. She\u2019s trying to manipulate you into continuing to fund her lifestyle. If she actually does go back to college and takes responsibility for tuition etc herself, then **maybe** she can gradually earn back your trust. In the meantime you are NTA.", "NTA. This is a life lesson. Doesn\u2019t matter that you are mom, she broke your trust and used you. Would\u2019ve done it for as long as she didn\u2019t get caught. \n\nSuggestion: let her pay for 1-2 semesters on her own & show she is serious about her education and then pick up the rest of the studies costs as you had intended?", "NTA at this point. I think she needs to show you she wants college, so expecting her to work for this and prove to you that she's serious about it would not be unreasonable. She's 19, has done something stupid, but she does need to learn a lesson here - she essentially scammed you!\n\nI think you do need to talk to her and find out why she dropped out. Was it the wrong course for her? Was she struggling? Was working and studying too much? Or was she just being a dumb 19 year old? You need to know, either way.", "NTA. But cue all the posts insisting she is just a child who didn\u2019t know better and made a mistake.", "NTA. If your ex thinks Sally should still have her college paid for, your ex can pay.", "Nta. You were scammed by your own daughter. She needs to pay back every cent she scammed out of you. Until she does that - don't give her a thing.", "NTA. But you could maybe make a deal that once they graduate you will release the money to them to pay off loans.\n\nReimburse them rather than risk paying for non-school things again.", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter just exploited your money and she needs to understand her moves have consequences too.", "Why would you pay for college when your daughter has already started her lucrative career as a scammer? NTA", "NTA.  She needs to prove to you that she is serious about her education and will do the right thing.  If she can get her act together and head in the right direction then you can always reconsider helping her again.", "NTA for this but YWBTA if you fund her habits again at all. You have other children, focus on them she is an adult and can learn that actions have consequences.", "NTA and if your ex thinks you're too harsh then they can pay for your daughter's college.", "Maybe unpopular, but\u2026 NTA.\n\nIn my opinion, her actions can definitely be described as a huge breach in trust.  The money was for tuition. But she dropped out and wanted to imitate that Carrie Bradshaw lifestyle. Well, the kid gotta do it on her own now.", "Nta.  This a fuck around and find out.\n\n She fucked around and lied, now she finds out her consequences", "She maintained a deception for financial gain over a period of time, not just a day or two. She lied to you, many times, to maintain that deception, even lying that the campus doesn\u2019t allow visitors so you wouldn\u2019t visit and suss her out. That\u2019s not a mistake. It\u2019s a massive scam.\n\nYou are NTA. Your daughter needs to prove herself now.", "NTA it wasn't a mistake it was a choice and choices have consequences.", "NTA.", "NTA. This wasn\u2019t a lie - this was outright theft. A lie would have been her misleading you about her grades. (That said, she now has a career ahead of her as a white-collar criminal)\n\nWhatever you decide to do in the future, trust has been broken is a big way, and it is your daughter\u2019s responsibility to prove that she is trustworthy, it is not your responsibility to give her that trust.", "NTA. If the money came from something like a 529 plan, she may have tax implications for using it on non college related expenses too.", "Info: who contributed to the college fund?\n\nIf anyone other than yourself contributed, YTA. If it was just you, NTA, but you could still use the fund to support her education without freely giving her full access to it. You could direct pay for tuition.", "I'm going to say ESH.\n\nSally for obvious reasons, but I do think you're being too harsh on her - she's your daughter, and she made a mistake. Did she ever want to go to college to begin with, or did she feel pressurized? How long will you hold a grudge? She's only 19, while yes that's an adult, she was probably caught up in the moment but is now realizing what she did was extremely wrong. If she does want to go back to college, and you refuse to fund her, you're actively harming her future and she may not want a relationship with you for that. At the end of the day, it really comes down to whether you want your daughter in your life or not.", "NTA- it\u2019s your money and clearly she was dishonest about how she was using it. However, if she\u2019s serious about not messing around and you really do want to pay for her tuition, you can do that. It\u2019s called direct pay and you can set it up with the registrar\u2019s office. My parents funded my college education and that\u2019s exactly how they did it.", "NTA She is 19, she should understand that her actions have consequences.", "NTA\n\nA mistake would be failing a class and not telling you.\n\nDropping out entirely and moving to a fancy apt, that is a conscious choice that she made.\n\nShe is only crying now because she got caught.", "Info: is this money already set aside for her education (like a prepaid plan) or are you paying it out of pocket as you go? Also, how much did she blow through on other than education expenses?\n\nI\u2019m leaning NTA, but would also advise that you still want her to be successful in the job market - if for no other reason than that you won\u2019t have to continue to support her. Maybe pay the tuition directly?", "NTA.  Your daughter lied, wasted money you saved for her education.  She's shown she can't be trusted, she's not sorry for what she's done. She's sorry she got caught.  What did she think was going to happen?  It's time to pay the piper. Instead of having her education paid for, she now has to pay for it herself.", "Nta. She didn't just quit school. She stole your money to fund her preferred lifestyle. If her friend hadn't let it slip you could have been paying for years.", "This is probably the most sane solutions I have read here. NTA", "This is a good solution, the daughter gets to have consequences for her actions but also parental support and love after proving herself.", "Agreed. Let her pay for a semester. If she does so, and successfully completes the term, the next one OP could cover.", "Mistakes happen. But you don't just happen to rent a luxury apartment, come up with lies to cover up what you did, and only stop when you are caught. That is more than a mistake.", "I'm also a bit unsure here. 19 is not a mature adult sure and most of them get excited by the freedom that comes with it. But 19 is also old enough to know responsibilities and follow through. \n\nWhile I agree that what she did was wrong, I'm just curious if there are other underlying reasons why she dropped out. Is she having problems in school and couldn't tell her parents?", "A mistake is a 12 year old swiping a candy bar. His 19 year old daughter stole and lied multiple times--this was not a momentary lapse in judgement. Now it's on her to find a way to pay for college if she's truly had a change of heart. He could always reimburse her for some of the tuition if she actually sticks with it this time. Having college paid for is a huge privilege and she blew it.", "You\u2019ve got to be joking. What would you consider a reasonable consequence for lying and stealing from the family?", "Happy Cake Day!", "That\u2019s a 19 year old who probably has a sheltered life, with zero taught life experience and ,without a doubt from what it sounds like ,peer pressure.  She lied and that is terrible and consequences absolutely should be established. But would you want someone hold something that you did at 19 against to the point it could affect your whole life."]}
