It was out of the blue and kind of an emergency because his MIL had a stroke and they wanted to go be with her. We know him quite well and it wasn't a problem at all.\n \nHowever, my wife had been down with the flu for the past two weeks. She was much better but she still was a bit worn out. After I got home from work the first day he was with us, my wife told me that entertaining her nephew had been hard for her and asked me to keep him busy the next day so she could get some rest. \n\nSo in order to entertain him, being the aunt I am, I took the day off, and (after informing my wife) took him to a ranch that is roughly 30 minutes out of town. I have a few horses there; I go horseback riding every other week and he loves animals. So I thought he might like the idea.\n\nWe both enjoyed the trip, he fed the horses and got the chance to pet them. I didn't let him ride the horse but we did watch a few people do it. We ate lunch there, went on a walk in nature, went to get my wife something from the area (I usually do that by myself but he wanted to help so I brought him along) and headed back home. \n\nWhen we told my BIL, he was quite angry. He said we shouldn't have taken the kid out, especially without my wife being there. His reason was something bad may have happened and he might have gotten an infection from the I interaction with animals.\n\nMy wife told him to cool it down but he wasn't having it. He told us he was going to ask a friend of his to come pick up his son, which he did. My wife feels pretty bad about the situation and I cannot help but blame myself because it was my idea to take him to see the horses in the first place.

He only fed and pet the animals, horse riding may have been a bit AHish not knowing the position of his parents, however you were smart enough not to do it.

He asked you to care for his kid for a weekend and you planned a really fun day. He needs to take the stick out of his ass. Poor kid. Dad doesn\u2019t want him around nature or animals.

I imagine your BIL is stressed, but he completely overreacted and it's poor of him to treat you like that when you're helping out. \n\nProbably best to not help out again in case you make an inappropriate trip to the shops or the cinema - can't be too careful /s", "NTA BIL can find someone else to watch him next time.

Seems like an odd reaction to an innocent day out with your nephew.", "NTA - an \u201cinfection\u201d lol. Your BIL sounds absolutely insufferable.", "Hold up what??? \n\nAbsolutely worst case scenario here...  nothing happened. \n\nDid BIL question your ability to make decisions in the best interest of son? What\u2019s missing here? Is kid allergic to animals? What kind of infection does BIL think kid is getting from horses? Does this kid have medical issues? Why did your wife need to be there? He was fine leaving kid with you & your wife knowing she was getting over being sick but is afraid of animal germs? Something doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nBased on this info... BIL seriously overreacted. WOW! Maybe he\u2019s just stressed. \n\nNTA\n\neta \u2014 did he leave instructions saying the kid needed to stay in your house & only watch pre-approved shows while he was gone? This is so weird. Hopefully, the kid had a fun day, doesn\u2019t sound like he will be seeing any animals anytime soon. Yeesh!", "NTA\n\nHis ignorance does not make you an asshole.\n\nBillions of people around the world interact with animals daily without getting infections.

You didn\u2019t let him do the activity that could potentially result in injury (riding the horse) without his parents\u2019 permission. If I were his parent, I\u2019d be grateful that you took him somewhere fun and educational instead of keeping him inside the whole time.

The kid saw a horse, he needs to get a grip, that level of overprotective is not healthy.", "Absolutely NTA. That was a great activity for your nephew. I am sure he was over the moon.

I am sorry her brother is a jerk.", "NTA, I don't see anything wrong with what you did.", "NTA. you took the kid out to have a good time *safely* (not letting him ride a horse). you did absolutely nothing wrong, just now you know to ask BIL next time you have an idea like that.

That was a pretty tame outing, and one your nephew obviously enjoyed. You may have been slightly overstepping to put him on a horse without his parents' permission, but you didn't.

Maybe the guy is stressed-out, but I suspect the real answer is now he's going to feel pressure to actually take the kid out to do fun stuff in nature instead of expecting him to be satisfied sitting around and watching Paw Patrol.

Don't ever watch the kid again.", "NTA:\n\nThis screams \"I'm not okay with my sister being married to another woman.\" Reading through the comments, you don't think that's it.

You did a really cool thing with your nephew so he can remember this a fun time, instead of a scary time. That's what's important. Yay super aunt!", "NTA. Your wife got a kid dumped off on her at the last minute and she did the best she could to keep the kid entertained with a normal kind of activity that kids like. Maybe BIL is under a lot of stress and worried about stuff given what is happening, so I'd give him a little extra grace, but he is being an ass.", "NTA. You\u2019re watching him for a few day, not a few hours, so he should expect you might take him somewhere.

I appreciate he might be stressed given MIL\u2019s situation but that is no excuse for the way he has treated you, particularly as you and your wife stepped up no notice to help out.  Given his over-protective, fun police tendencies I\u2019d suggest your wife makes it clear to him that neither of you will be available for any childcare assistance moving forward, and tell him what a shame it is that his son will miss out due to his father\u2019s aggressive and ungrateful behaviour.  Poor little lad, sounds like he had an awesome day with you and quite probably promoted you to favourite auntie.", "NAH. \"Infection from animals\" is a weird fear to have, but whatever.

How long have you been married? How long has he known you?", "Your BIL should have delivered his list if rules. He did not.  Your decisions were perfectly rational.  Tell BIL he is an ungrateful jerk but out of respect for the childrearing views he has only know expressed, you will not burden him in the future with any offers to care for his son.", "I\u2019m sorry but WTH, most people would be thrilled that their child was outside unattached to their screens. NTA", "NTA- he will probably apologise to you in the future. Hopefully he is being a dick because of stress.", "Nta. If you had let him ride without a parent\u2019s permission, that would have been one thing but this was a totally innocent trip. \u201cGet an infection from an animal\u201d?
