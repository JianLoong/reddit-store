We know him quite well and it wasn't a problem at all.\n \nHowever, my wife had been down with the flu for the past two weeks. She was much better but she still was a bit worn out. After I got home from work the first day he was with us, my wife told me that entertaining her nephew had been hard for her and asked me to keep him busy the next day so she could get some rest. \n\nSo in order to entertain him, being the aunt I am, I took the day off, and (after informing my wife) took him to a ranch that is roughly 30 minutes out of town. I have a few horses there; I go horseback riding every other week and he loves animals. So I thought he might like the idea.\n\nWe both enjoyed the trip, he fed the horses and got the chance to pet them. I didn't let him ride the horse but we did watch a few people do it. We ate lunch there, went on a walk in nature, went to get my wife something from the area (I usually do that by myself but he wanted to help so I brought him along) and headed back home. \n\nWhen we told my BIL, he was quite angry. He said we shouldn't have taken the kid out, especially without my wife being there. His reason was something bad may have happened and he might have gotten an infection from the I interaction with animals.\n\nMy wife told him to cool it down but he wasn't having it.

I appreciate he might be stressed given MIL\u2019s situation but that is no excuse for the way he has treated you, particularly as you and your wife stepped up no notice to help out.

He is an utter ****\n\nNTA", "I don't think anyone is the asshole here. Yes BIL's reaction seems inappropriate, but he was in the midst of a family medical emergency and was likely extremely stressed already. I don't think he's really *that* mad about you taking his son out of the house, I think he was just suddenly reminded of him and his loved one's mortality and was just anxious about all the bad things that could happen. And I don't think there was anything actually wrong with you taking the kid out to a ranch, it just made his dad a bit freaked out. When my grandma had a stroke my entire family was on edge for like a year. \n\nJust a generally unfortunate situation all around. I think y'all should talk it out and you should just say \"I didn't realize you weren't comfortable with me taking your son somewhere else and I'm sorry for making you worry. Next time I'll call and ask you if it's okay first.\" No need to have a major blowout over it, methinks.", "I feel bad for the kid, he'll probably remember this day for the rest of his life as the last time he got to have fun. \n\nNTA and your BIL should reflect on his behavior and apologize to you and your wife.", "NTA. It sounds to me his problem isn't so much that you took him out to see animals, but that YOU took him out. You said the BiL argued that the kiddo could have gotten an infection from the animals, which most illnesses can't jump species, but could certainly come from a relative recovering from the flu. Then also emphasized that you did it without your wife with you. So unless your wife is an EMT,  or other such medical professional, any emergency that came up you'd be just as capable, maybe more so, in handling.\n\nSo his issue is you, not the activities you did. I don't want to speculate with very little info why he has any problem with you, but this sounds like the crux of the issue. Personally, as a father myself, I think you and your wife are saints for agreeing to help out all of a sudden, especially as one of you are getting over being ill. And I think you did a bang on job taking him out to the ranch as that's a great experience for a child and a lot more fun than staying in all day.", "An infection from petting an animal?

Your BIL is an AH.", "NTA BIL should appreciate you taking care of his kid on such short notice and for taking him somewhere you thought he would enjoy. He acted like you had the child participate in some highly dangerous activity. It's actually good for children to to be exposed to animals, nature, and, yes, farm germs. BIL was completely over the top and he has issues.", "NTA. Why TF would he leave the kid with y\u2019all if he didn\u2019t trust either of you to take the kid out solo?  You are not attached at the hip to your spouse and a number of things could occur to end up leaving you alone with the kid. You can get an infection from damn near anything\u2026what the hell did he mean about from the animals? I don\u2019t understand the concerns there. This dude makes no sense to me. Hopefully it is just a weird reaction to stress of MIL stroke. \n\nThen again maybe I am not the best judge for this because my parents let me go to my grandparents\u2019 farm (in a neighboring state) for practically the entire summer throughout my childhood (and it was awesome!!) Hell, I even flew there alone one summer when I was like seven. My aunt lives around five minutes from my grandparents. I would often go to work with her for the day and just hang out there being somewhat supervised by her and her coworkers, and it was in a fifty two story building. She took me to amusement parks, water parks, shopping, and even to a lakeside resort once-all without my parents because they trusted her and my grandparents to take care of me. I guess the 90s were wild or something lol.\n\nAnywho, I would try to have a calm discussion about why he was angry.

At that kids age I was pretty much living in the mud and would have DIED for a day at a ranch. I did get to spend a weekend at a ranch when I was 10 and holy shit it was so great. Like I guarantee that kid has put stuff in his mouth more dangerous than a day around some horses.", "Happy cake day!", "Actually horses can be dangerous if approached wrong. But it sounds like the PO did a great job of supervising and making sure there were no incidents. Possibly should have made a quick call to BIL to explain the excursion but it does sound like he overreacted. The couple may not be saddled with babysitting again.", "Think of it from his perspective. Him and his wife have left their child with you because the MIL had a stroke. Having a stroke is not just \"kind of an emergency\" it is an *EMERGENCY.* As in balls to the walls all hands on deck \"you might die if you don't go to the hospital *now*\" kind of emergency. The kind of emergency that makes you feel sick when it's done because you were so pumped up on adrenaline the whole time. \n\nSo you drop your kid off with someone you trust so that you don't have to also be stressed out about where your child is and if *they're* safe. Because your only concern right now is making sure everyone makes it out of this alive. \n\nAnd then you find out that your kid was not even remotely where you thought they were that whole time, but was instead out around *horses* and suddenly you're imagining all the ways a horse could hurt a five year old and now you're imagining yourself in the emergency room again but instead of your MIL lying in the bed it's the tiny body of your own 5 year old. Sure nothing bad actually happened to the kid, *this time.* But if something bad *did* happen then what would you have done? \n\nYour brother in law's reaction only seems extreme when you forget that we are literally dealing with human lives here.
