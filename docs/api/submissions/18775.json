Thanks in advance for reading!\n\nI, (25F), work overnight at a hotel front desk. My job is usually to check in anyone who comes in super late, check out anyone who decides to leave super early, refill coffee, get towels, do paperwork, blah blah\n\nI get a call from a room at 5 AM from an elderly woman asking me to grab her clothes... From her locked car.  Apparently she washed her clothes in her room or something (we don't have laundry service and I guess that was her solution) and left them to dry in her car... (Yeah... I don't know.  Apparently another coworker told her to do that. Weird!)  She claimed that her current clothing was smelly and disgusting so she didn't want to put them back on after her shower.  Apparently all she had was a towel and couldn't go herself.  She said she'd leave the keys hanging outside her room door. \n\nImmediately I was uncomfortable with the idea. Perhaps I watch too much true crime, but this felt like a one way ticket to jumped and kidnapped or whatever. The sun hasn't risen yet, I'm fat and out of shape, and the most I can do to an attacker is attempt to be dead weight if they grabbed me and hope my fat would be good armor, lol. \n\nDespite me clearly stating my discomfort in going into a strangers car, she was extremely insistent and kept repeating herself and talking in circles at me about how other employees got stuff out of her car for her and how \"maybe I should stay somewhere with better help.\" (Okay?) Honestly her being so insistent about it made me even more uncomfortable...  Even if I was being silly about being attacked, she could very easily claim I took something out of her car (no cameras in the parking lot) and it would be her word against mine. \n\nI felt kind of bad when she told me about how she had a fracture and how she was old and frail and needed help.  Part of me thought that I was being silly and I should just be kind and help an old woman...  but I stuck to my guns albeit with a bit of guilt. Eventually I ttansferred her to security, who escorted me to her car to grab the things. The security man even confirmed this wasn't our policy, which made me feel a bit better at least.  I just feel bad wasting everyone's time, and maybe I should of just done this for an old woman, especially since people had already done it for her before. \n\nSo, what do you guys think?

There are several details here that are extremely bizarre. Going to a guest\u2019s car to retrieve items for them would be above and beyond your job duties.

It\u2019s not part of your job to get a guests own property (their clothes) out of their property (their car). \n\nAdditionally your instincts are correct. Their could be a possibility that you\u2019re being put in a vulnerable position (outside of the hotel lobby and in the parking lot at night). Any number of bad things could happen to you while you are in the parking lot like being abducted. \n\nWhen you\u2019re working overnight and alone, your safety takes priority over someone\u2019s convenience.", "NTA without a doubt. The guest is entitled and inconsiderate.", "NTA\n\nI feel bad for her, but you made the right call. My first thought was similar to yours - what if she accuses you of stealing stuff from her car? Also, this is a totally abnormal request of a hotel front desk worker. Lastly, it sounds like she attempted to wash clothes in her sink and hang them in her car to dry? Who does that and why? Why not hang them in her room on the fucking shower rod or something? Weird as fuck and sounds like a suspicious set up.", "NTA\nYou watched out for yourself and did all the right things. \nThat screams scam! \nAnd even if not, don't let people bully you into things you are uncomfortable with!", "NTA. If she\u2019s so injured she can\u2019t come down to her car, how did she get up to hotel room in the first place? And besides the crime risk you mentioned, she could\u2019ve also accused you of stealing something from her car. I think ultimately going with security was the right call. I probably would\u2019ve made it clear to her that is a one-off favour as she had no clothes, that it isn\u2019t part of your usual responsibilities, and that security will be escorting you. If I had been that old lady, I would\u2019ve thrown my dirty clothes on just to run to the car and then change immediately after. What a wild request to make of a receptionist.", "NTA. Also\u2026 why couldn\u2019t she hang the stuff in the room?", "I think imma day NTA you felt uncomfortable and expressed this to her in situations like this you can't trust anyone .This wasn't your policy so you had every right not to do it but at least you went with security.", "NTA, not only is it a safety liability, this kind of stuff could set you up to be falsely accused of stealing something from her car. Guests are responsible for grabbing their own stuff in their cars. She should\u2019ve brought more clean clothes or hit up a laundromat, or even just bought new clothes if she needed them that badly.", "NTA that is super weird and I would have been just as uncomfortable. Good for you for sticking to your guns.", "NTA.  She should have figured out her clothes *before* her shower.   Not been stuck in a towel. I wonder if she would have come to the door naked or something.  I agree this has red flags. \n\nMaybe it was just poor planning on her part but poor planning on her part shouldn\u2019t be an emergency on your part.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**You are right to stay away from shady requests made by seniors telling you they are naked and waiting for you to bring them something.**", "NTA. Having someone with you as a witness was a very smart move", "NTA. I worked in the hotel biz for 10 years at 4 star hotels.  This is NOT normal!  And yes, you\u2019re opening yourself up to serious liability issues by going to her car and getting something out of it for her.", "NTA. That's a weird ask.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't be concerned about kidnapping or attackers. I'd be more concerned about the liability issue. Let's say you do get something from her car for her. What's to stop her from saying you stole something? \n\nAnd honestly? This is just so weird. She should have brought in her clean clothes *before* showering.", "Nta. You did help her and you did so safely.  I spurt you wasted the security guards time and even of you sis it was a small inconvenience for you both help someone in need. Don't ever take your safety lightly. It's better to be aware of possible danger than pretend that bad things don't happen.  You did the right thing. Edit to add that I meant to say I doubt you caused more of an inconvenience. \nAlso, people saying that your actions were unprofessional may be correct but, sometimes it's ok to bend the rules a little to be a good part of the world. It wasn't your job but you did it anyway and there is nothing wrong with that. It's also ok if you don't make it habit to do things that are not required for your job. You don't need to feel guilty about that in anyway.", "NTA. very weird who goes to a hotel and doesn't bring a change of clothes?", "NTA. But also not very professional. As you can see the solution was super simple, call security and have them come with you so you have both a witness and someone to ensure your safety.\n\nThe old lady's safety was not at risk and her request was out of policy, so you were entitled to say no.

I feel a lot better about it now   I felt so guilty for not just going with it.", ">Going to a guest\u2019s car to retrieve items for them would be above and beyond your job duties.\n\nHijacking the top comment to say that what makes the old lady's request unreasonable is that it was made at 5am, when a.) there is legitimate reason to worry about safety in a parking lot (especially for a female employee), and b.) the service standards of the hotel would necessarily be a lot less equipped to deal with issues in general.\n\nHowever, depending on the quality of the hotel, it's absolutely within a receptionist's (and concierge's) duties to handle, keep and/or move the property of a guest if it is the guest's explicit request and it doesn't leave hotel premises. That's the entire reason concierge storing rooms exist, as well as safes in the reception back-offices for more valuable items.\n\nSome people have taken issue with my response being \"NTA but unprofessional all the same\". OP isn't an AH, but as far as I can tell from this post she also isn't a very good receptionist. There is nothing here to indicate that she engaged in any form of problem-solving, that she even bothered asking herself \"is there any way I can meet this guest's requests? Is there any way I can make her happy without feeling uncomfortable or putting myself out of safety?\" Instead, it looks like she said no without thinking it over, until the request was transferred to security who had to do OP's job for her and provide her with a solution (getting a security guy to go with her) that should have been the first thought of any competent receptionist.\n\nAnd yes, I worked as a Hilton receptionist, supervisor and night manager for 5 years.", "Thank you!  I do need to work on putting myself before strangers. I tend to be a bit too giving and bend over to being pushed around a lot. I guess you could thank the true crime podcast I was just listening to that made me more paranoid.", "I appreciate the comment and input!  I felt really guilty about it.", "I think she may have just been a not fully there older woman.  I'm honestly not sure. Apparently my coworker told her to do it???  Also her clothes were still wet when I brought them to her. It would of been smarter to hang them on the ac/heating thing, right?", "Thank you!  I try. I'm kind of a pushover especially if people guilt me.", "Yeah I'm really unsure why she was so adamant about not wearing the dirty clothes. They apparently smelled bad?  I hate to say it but perhaps she soiled them?", "Yeah that's the weird part...  I really don't know. Maybe she thought the warmth of the day would dry them faster?", "Thank you!  I'm glad I thought of security, even if she initially didn't want to wait for them.", "Yeah, I'm really glad I thought of that. Imagine if she lost or forgot something and blamed me, that would of been a whole big situation.", "Thank you so much!  I almost caved in but I'm really glad I didn't. Imagine if she accused me of stealing something, that would've caused a ton of issues", "I ended up delivering them with the security guard with me, and she peeked through the door in a towel, but yeah she was naked under. She was very thankful at least, though I still felt so.strange.", "Ha!  I didn't even think of that part. If she were an old man I may have been even more weirded out by the whole thing. Gender double standards I guess!", "Thank you!  I'm glad I thought of it at the last moment when I wasn't sure what to do.", "Yeah imagine if she misplaced her wallet and then blamed me. There were tons of things in her car as well. Very easy to misplace something and place blame.", "Yeah the more I think about it the stranger it seems. Why wash her clothes in the sink/shower and then put them in her car?  Why was she okay putting them in her car earlier but not now?  Why shower with dirty clothes and nothing to change to?  Was she simply expecting whoever was up front to help her?  What if there was no night receptionist?  So strange.", "Yeah I honestly think my coworker who doesn't know the rules and stuff did everything she asked for her, and she was literally just expecting us to continue to fetch things for her or something. Kinda rude now that I think about it.", "Thank you!", "Something I didn't mention is that there was like .. . A TON of clothes in her car that I guess she set out to dry.... Like... What???  It was so strange!", "Well I mean... I did try my best given the situation I think?  She really wanted me specifically to do it for her.  I wasn't quite sure what to do since it is against our policy and I could have gotten in real trouble depending on how it went.  I tried to politely explain this to her, unfortunately my coworkers broke the policy and did something similar.  Security is usually reserved for emergencies since it's y'know, 5 in the morning, and a few of them are a bit rude former cops. Luckily the one who came with me was very nice and understanding of why I asked him to help.", "I did delegate the task to security?  Actually no, I did what she asked me to do! just with security escorting me and as a witness.", "I mean. I did. It just wasn't really relevant to the story. The parts that were relevant was me refusing and then feeling bad for refusing. If I wasn't problem solving I would of just told her no and hung up, lol, not offer security.  I didn't want to clutter and make a huge wall of text of the intricate details of the conversation.\n\nOh and we don't have any sort of service to bring stuff up to guests rooms. When I do that I do it just to help people, it isn't technically in my job description, as I'm mainly night audit.", "It's one of the strangest things I've heard of.", ">If I wasn't problem solving I would of just told her no and hung up, lol, not offer security.\n\nThis isn't a boast. A receptionist who just says no and hangs up to a guest request should not be working as a receptionist and this is not an alternative you should even be contemplating. The correct response would have been to put her on hold, call security yourself, and look for a resolution internally. If you followed up with security and there was no way to meet the guest's requests, then yeah, it's perfectly fine to call the old lady back and tell her you're sorry but in this case you can't help. But you should not have passed the hot potato to somebody else, and you certainly shouldn't have put security in the position of doing customer service. That's your responsibility, not theirs.\n\nIn your defence though, it does sound like you're working for a very small hotel with highly limited service facilities. If you feel like you're going above and beyond by \"bringing stuff up to a guest room\", which is one of the most basic duties of a night receptionist, then your hotel clearly doesn't offer much in the way of reception services.\n\nEDIT: And now I learn this from your reply to my other comment:\n\n>Security is usually reserved for emergencies since it's y'know, 5 in the morning, and a few of them are a bit rude former cops. \n\nAnd your idea was to connect a guest in the middle of a complaint to rude former cops who should only be answering in emergencies. Yeah, sorry but the way you handled this was WAY unprofessional.", "You seem to have not read that I did not delegate the task to security. That is objectively an incorrect fact.  I had security do their job by escorting me and being a witness, thanks to them I was able to do the task. She was just, at first, extremely adamant I do the task, not security (probably so she didn't have to wait.) Which is why I felt guilty.", "You are very confusing and contradictory with your statements.  First you say I should of offered security sooner, then not at all, then that I was right too not go out for her, then I wasn't right and unprofessional. I can't win with you, huh?  Do you think I should of gone into a strangers car or not?  That's the issue here. Being uncomfortable going alone to a strangers car despite them insisting I do, and then feeling a bit bad over it. Problem solve?  If I can't use security, and I can't go outside because I'm uncomfortable, and I can't tell her no, what am I to do exactly, oh great Hilton manager?\n\nI also said \"usually\" not always. They're on site always. I just prefer to not waste their time.", "If you worked at a hotel then you should understand the liability that op would be placing on herself if she'd just complied with the request", "You asked people for their opinion, and I gave you mine as somebody who worked in exactly your industry for several years. If you're certain you did everything right, then surely there's no need for us to argue any further. Best of luck to you.", "NTA-that request was outside your job description and just super weird.", "NTA, a lot of the time when women are trying to be polite and nice because that\u2019s how the world tells us to act, leads to they get killed bc they ignore all the little red flags everywhere and this woman was dropping them everywhere. \n\nStick to your guns. You do not go out to a dark parking lot where there\u2019s no cameras to get something from a guest\u2019s car, bad consequences could be as light as attempting to say you stole from her, all the way to murder and kidnapping.", "NTA! As others pointed out, her request was a liability and a safety issue. Frankly, you should let a manager know what happened, what you ended up doing for her, and what she claimed the coworker said so your manager can let everyone else know what the proper protocol is for things like this in the future.", "NTA.", "Yeah, my concern wasn\u2019t for the employee getting jumped, but for the employee being blamed for damage to the car or missing items. \n\nThis whole thing is sketchy", "> there is legitimate reason to worry about safety in a parking lot (especially for a female employee)\n\nDo people on this sub just thing women are randomly getting attacked at any moment left and right? Jesus must be exhausting to live like that, making up dangers around every corner.", "you realize that women do get attacked in situations like this one all the time, right? it IS exhausting living like this, only the dangers are far from made up. you came so close to getting the idea only to faceplant just short of understanding.", "I've been physically assaulted both on and off hotel premises. And I'm a guy. Night shifts are rough, buddy.", "Didn\u2019t say it never happens. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s common.

It does seem weird that she was so pushy about it, especially when it was dark outside. That seems really suspicious. NTA. Keep yourself safe.", "NTA.

If I were you I\u2019d check in with coworkers on other shifts to see what they have heard from this guest and get on the same page\u2026 otherwise your willingness to figure out a solution here could easily be mischaracterized by her when she\u2019s asking the next shift to take care of bizarre tasks on her behalf.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t see is how your safety was at risk and I would avoid bringing that up with management lol.", "How did she get the wet (heavier) clothes *to* the car for drying if she\u2019s old & has a fractured bone?", "NTA\n\nI would have called security 1st thing and that was the right thing to do. Tag team it so all bases are covered.\n\nMan people are weird.", "NTA, at all. As someone who also works in hospitality (housekeeping) we are not permitted to touch any guest\u2019s personal belongings, so if a bed has personal belongings on it then it doesn\u2019t get made up/sheets changed, which means that the guest\u2019s car is a no go. She could then accuse you of stealing something from it. Also, she is very likely lying about other workers at the hotel getting things from her car for her. In case she isn\u2019t, let everyone else working there know that this is a violation of policy (if it is even in your policies).", "NTA", "NTA, the second you get those keys you're liable and not protected by your job.", "And if she washed them last night why didn't she get them BEFORE her shower", "Who stays in a hotel and takes a shower without a change of clothes with them?  \n\n\nIt's often considered sketchy for a hotel guest to arrive without any luggage whatsoever, isn't it?", "That screams scam!
