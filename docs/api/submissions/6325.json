I was low on budget and cut down on a lot of unnecessary expenses. \n\nSo when found a bridal makeup artist whose style I  loved, I was disappointed to know that her charge for a wedding day makeup was grossly out of my budget. I wanted to get a very light makeup look but even that was out of question for me.\n\nHere's what I did, which can be called cheating. I booked the artist but I booked her on her engagement party charges. \n\nSo basically if you know that you're getting proposed or getting an engagement photoshoot, the same light wedding day makeup would be considerably cheaper. \n\nI went to her studio in the morning, got my dream makeup look, paid her in full and came back to get married in the afternoon. The wedding went as per the plan and I was content. \n\nBut since we live in a relatively small city, when I posted my wedding pictures on Facebook, my makeup artist saw those and she texted me that I cheated her and that I am a fraud. \n\nI apologised and I confessed that I did choose a loophole due to being on a budget but she kept calling me names. In the end, I told her that I didn't make her travel to my venue, instead, I drove to her, paid without any bargaining and didn't waste a minute of her time more than that. So she shouldn't really make such a huge issue. \n\nWhen I told my family about this, my aunt said that it was a huge asshole move on my part.

Bridal makeup usually comes with a bunch of extras. You did not need those extras and booked a different service accordingly.", "NTA.  These markups for weddings are ridiculous.  You got exactly what you wanted and she agreed to the price.  What you did after you left has nothing to do with her.", "I feel like this is the opposite viewpoint of the story from the makeup artist that posted here a while ago. \n\nINFO: did she explain what the difference was between wedding day makeup and engagement makeup? Like is there a different type of product used?", "NTA - you purchased a standard service at her location; what you do with it afterwards is your business, not hers.

Why is she charging so much more for rhe same make up because it is a wedding?

You paid for an engagement makeup and went to her. Got that done and got married. You didn't get anything extra done wedding wise for the makeup so I don't see a difference.

You didn't get anything for free, you didn't get any extras, and the artist didn't lose any money on the deal.", "NTA, I don't understand the reasoning for that pricing difference. You should pay for the make up style and maybe the products used (higher quality - higher price). The occasion shouldn't matter at all. A traveling fee is also reasonable if traveling is indeed required or wanted.", "NTA - you paid her to do your make-up, which she did. Doesn't matter if the make-up is being worn to a wedding, photo shoot, or play time with kids.", "I guess YTA for lying but in theory customers shouldn't have to disclose what the product/service is for especially if it isn't provided on location. Charge for what is provided not the event. The industry on the whole is the AH.", "NTA. She was perfectly willing to provide you that service at the price you paid. She only got upset once she realized she could\u2019ve gotten more money from you. You didn\u2019t trick her into doing more work or different work than she would normally do for the price. She has no control over what you do outside of your service. Wedding markups are insane and you were smart to find a way to get around this particular markup.

Especially in a small town this was stupid and word gets around, don't lie to get discounts.\n\nOn the other hand \u2013 the *exact same thing* costs different amounts based on what it's 'for'. This is a pretty ridiculous setup because the makeup artist's costs are the same either way, but they're pricing the customers because of how out-of-control wedding costs are. So I don't approve of the whole thing and understand why you looked for a loophole, but it's still cheating, and in a small town you should've known she'd find out.", "NTA.

The only thing you wanted was basic light makeup, the only way for you to get that was to go with her engagement package and you paid her for that.\n\nMy understanding is that wedding makeup packages usually cost more because the makeup artist travels to you, does test runs of your make up, touches up your makeup through the day .. pretty much committed to you and your event all day long so they have to include all of this in their fees. They can't be in their shop that day or take on other clients. You however didn't want any of these services.
