I was low on budget and cut down on a lot of unnecessary expenses. \n\nSo when found a bridal makeup artist whose style I  loved, I was disappointed to know that her charge for a wedding day makeup was grossly out of my budget. I wanted to get a very light makeup look but even that was out of question for me.\n\nHere's what I did, which can be called cheating. I booked the artist but I booked her on her engagement party charges. \n\nSo basically if you know that you're getting proposed or getting an engagement photoshoot, the same light wedding day makeup would be considerably cheaper. \n\nI went to her studio in the morning, got my dream makeup look, paid her in full and came back to get married in the afternoon. The wedding went as per the plan and I was content. \n\nBut since we live in a relatively small city, when I posted my wedding pictures on Facebook, my makeup artist saw those and she texted me that I cheated her and that I am a fraud. \n\nI apologised and I confessed that I did choose a loophole due to being on a budget but she kept calling me names. In the end, I told her that I didn't make her travel to my venue, instead, I drove to her, paid without any bargaining and didn't waste a minute of her time more than that. So she shouldn't really make such a huge issue. \n\nWhen I told my family about this, my aunt said that it was a huge asshole move on my part.

Bridal makeup usually comes with a bunch of extras. You did not need those extras and booked a different service accordingly.", "NTA.  These markups for weddings are ridiculous.

You paid for an engagement makeup and went to her. Got that done and got married. You didn't get anything extra done wedding wise for the makeup so I don't see a difference.

You should pay for the make up style and maybe the products used (higher quality - higher price). The occasion shouldn't matter at all. A traveling fee is also reasonable if traveling is indeed required or wanted.", "NTA - you paid her to do your make-up, which she did. Doesn't matter if the make-up is being worn to a wedding, photo shoot, or play time with kids.", "I guess YTA for lying but in theory customers shouldn't have to disclose what the product/service is for especially if it isn't provided on location. Charge for what is provided not the event. The industry on the whole is the AH.", "NTA. She was perfectly willing to provide you that service at the price you paid. She only got upset once she realized she could\u2019ve gotten more money from you. You didn\u2019t trick her into doing more work or different work than she would normally do for the price. She has no control over what you do outside of your service. Wedding markups are insane and you were smart to find a way to get around this particular markup.

Especially in a small town this was stupid and word gets around, don't lie to get discounts.\n\nOn the other hand \u2013 the *exact same thing* costs different amounts based on what it's 'for'. This is a pretty ridiculous setup because the makeup artist's costs are the same either way, but they're pricing the customers because of how out-of-control wedding costs are. So I don't approve of the whole thing and understand why you looked for a loophole, but it's still cheating, and in a small town you should've known she'd find out.", "NTA.

The only thing you wanted was basic light makeup, the only way for you to get that was to go with her engagement package and you paid her for that.\n\nMy understanding is that wedding makeup packages usually cost more because the makeup artist travels to you, does test runs of your make up, touches up your makeup through the day .. pretty much committed to you and your event all day long so they have to include all of this in their fees. They can't be in their shop that day or take on other clients. You however didn't want any of these services.

NTA", "The MUA lives in a small town I doubt she\u2019s doing this just for fun - she is trying to make a living if you can\u2019t afford the bridal package, don\u2019t get bridal make up with her", "At my wedding, I paid the full price. There's where no touch up. No makeup artist for the day. A hour of her time. That's it. That who it work in Quebec, Canada. Why paid extra where's there is none.", "If OP was expecting free bridal extras when not booking bridal makeup, then she'd be the AH. She didn't expect anything other than what she paid for though, so she's not.", "I agree with this. The price should be based on the amount and level of service, not the fact that its labeled as a \"wedding\" or an \"engagement\" or whatever else. NTA", "I will add, do NOT do this with your photographer. Working with a photographer for a wedding is extremely different than working with one for an event. At least with any decent wedding photographer", "D", "She did choose the cheaper option.", "OP didn't want the wedding services though. If she was harassing the make up artist to follow her all day and touch up the make up, but she didn't want any of that.", "How did she circumvent it? She chose a service and paid for it.", "She *paid* for her services. Why should the makeup artist care if it's for a wedding, a bridal shower, or her cat's tea party? It's the same job for her.", "But she didn't get wedding make-up. She got engagement make-up, therefore she should be charged for the engagement make-up", "All the examples you gave are different prices because the second thing is actually different; the same does not apply to this makeup.", "If the states policy is stupid and unethical, it\u2019s not an asshole move to avoid it.", "Man. My salon would charge me a men's neck trim price when I was growing out my pixie because I just needed my neck trimmed real quick while the front grew out. Reading stuff like this makes me thankful.", "OP wanted and paid for an engagement look. No harm, no foul.", "I was about to disagree but what\u2019s the difference between engagement and wedding aside from the dresses? Not to mention many do the sam for catering \ud83d\udc80", "Yeah, and if they don't use any of that and the OP is fine with the service that she paid for and received, then I think OP is in the clear.", "True, but that's because they are using better (and more expensive) metrials, not because the type of the event. \nYou can use it for other types of events, or use the \"lesser\" products for your wedding, if you want.", "They might, but she DIDN'T, so OP got the same service and has no need to pay more.", "I mean, a lot of that is because of the headache. Between planners and bridezillas/groomzillas and mothers and crazy jealous cousins, weddings tend to involve a lot more *mental* effort and hassle. Because people have a ***vision*** that has to be met.", "She didn't get the bridal package though, didn't expect any other services, didn't expect the MUA to travel to her or anything. All of *those* are what makes a bridal package cost more (plus other elements) but the OP didn't expect any of that and didn't complain or try to convince the MUA to do more than she paid for.", "She didn't.  She got engagement make-up and that's what she paid for.", "That really shady. I know a professional makeup artist in Montreal, and what's included in bridal vs regular package is different. Bridal also has one or two test run sessions way before the wedding. \n\nOverall, if a makeup artist cannot explain the difference between bridal/regular that would be a big red flag.", "Oh yah big difference for a photographer. My dumbass SIL tried that with her photographer. Like, she needs an assistant and you booked a 4 hour party package rather than the whole day wedding package. Her photographer just cancelled their contract and all she has is terrible cellphone pictures now", "When you pay for art, you aren't paying for just materials. You are paying for education, talent, experience, and time. The bride is a cheap ass who wanted something for cheap so she lied. The MUA needs to have a fraud clause in her contract so she can sue people who do this in the future.", "That's comparing apples to almonds. \n\nShe lied, in order to get a lower rate. \n\nShe could have said, \"hey, can I get the lower rate if I come to you and it's just light makeup and no touchups?\" Or she could have said, \"hey, I love your work, but I can't afford your wedding package. Is there any way to bring your price into my budget?\" The makeup artist would very likely have tried to work out a deal. That would have been the right way to handle it. \n\nLying to get a lower price is just not OK. She cheated the makeup artist. \n\nAnd it's hilarious that people on this sub think this is OK, considering all the situations they go ballistic over.", "It's the sneakiness to get the lower price that makes them an asshole, rather than being upfront and honest about your budget/needs.", "Those are up-charges that are real part of the service provided.", "The difference is the expectation level.", "Had one try up. Wouldn't have need it, because I wanted it very light. Don't get me me wrong. I was happy but it's cost way too much for the results.", "I feel like with the photographer it isn't going to work because hes goong to get a pretty good idea that hes photographing a wedding", "She could have set up a consultation with the makeup artist and been honest with what her needs were. Maybe the artist would have offered a different rate for OP\u2019s wedding because she truly would be using less services. But OP will never know because she chose to be deceitful. And if she ever wants her makeup professionally done in the future, she has to hope that this artist hasn\u2019t told their professional network about what she did.", "Then the MUA should stop offering the cheaper option. She would be laughed out of court.", "I'll just go ahead and say it:  whatever I do with whatever product I buy after I leave your shop is none of your fucking business.  Can you name one other business that tries this crap?  I can't think of a single one.", "She didn't want any of those extra so didn't get them. Why should she pay extra for shit she didn't want or need?", ">in order to get a lower rate.\n\nShe got a lower service.", "Yeah I remember that story. She got an engagement package (I think it was from a photographer), then tried to bully her way into a wedding level service", "She shouldn't have to lie to purchase the exact services she wants at the advertised price.  Guess it sucks when scammers lose one here or there.", "Yes exactly !!", "Why should she?  MUA offered the exact services she wanted so she selected that.  Her afternoon's schedule affected MUA in exactly no manner whatsoever, nor was it MUA's business to know in the first place.\n\nWould you support a baker charging 50% more for a birthday cake than an anniversary cake, even if neither is marked as such?", "No, she wouldn't be laughed out of small claims court. I know because a friend faced this exact situation and was advised by her lawyer brother to add the clause to her contract. Three brides have tried to lie about what services they required and lost before a judge. Fuck around and find yourself in a court. \u270c\ud83c\udffd\n\nShould have paid the extra $75 and avoided lawyer/court fees.", "Stylists, artists, bakers, performers- lots of people price depending on the occasion, location, etc.", "Then she should\u2019ve booked a simple look. Either way she didn\u2019t book what she wanted. She wanted A, so to avoid paying for B, she booked and received C. Instead of telling the MUA upfront she wanted A. MUA feels used and taken advantage of and I get it. Nowhere in this story does it say MUA is demanding OP pay more or that she *needed* to book a wedding makeup look - all I get from it is that MUA is ticked off and was under the impression she was providing makeup for an engagement, not a wedding.", "And ripping off brides for nothing extra isn't?", "Thank you!  It's not gouging when you state your price up front. That's just capitalism. If the OP didn't want to pay the stated prices, she was free to take her business elsewhere.", "She explicitly did NOT want wedding-level product or service.  She wanted the lower grade product with no onsite service or travel.  MUA offered it at price X and that's what she paid, not price Z for the wedding-grade.  The only sleazy behavior was from the MUA for trying to get Z for X.", "Really?  Who charges more for a haircut if you're going on a date that night vs. staying in, for example?\n\nAgain, we're talking about for the exact same product and service.  Bakers might deliver products of differing quality based on use (kids' birthday cakes don't require the same ingredient quality as a wedding cake, which has to maintain the structural integrity of a much larger mass and stay fresh longer).\n\nOP just staying in the shop and used normal materials.  Why pay for higher quality ingredients and venue services she isn't using?", "If MUA doesn't want to offer the engagement level service, she doesn't have to, but you can't blame people for accepting the services you your bloody self chose to offer.", "She DID pay the stated prices for the services she received.  The MUA just didn't get to scam her for something unwanted and undelivered.", "Why not just book someone else?", "That's one of the arguments of those Christian bakers, isn't it?", "So effing what?  She paid for exactly what she received, not the higher level product or extraneous services.", "Oh no she lied?! Because lying is clearly the basis for being an AH. /s"]}
