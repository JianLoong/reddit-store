He'll learn (hopefully) in time that money isn't free and now you can be there to help teach him that.

If he is a good student, perhaps he can transfer some of his abilities to meet expectations into  part-time employment to cover his fun money.\n\nIt may be challenging for him to find and keep a job since he has poor work habits and may not have practical work skills. If you have options to set him up with a job, you may want to do that. \n\nYou may have to put some effort into monitoring him if he can\u2019t manage himself independently. Maybe his bank can put limits on how much he can withdraw from his accounts each week to help him budget. It sounds like things went better until you made an exception with his alleged visit to see his girlfriend.\n\nDon\u2019t concern yourself with his relationship with his girlfriend. If she wasn\u2019t part of his lie about the broken arm, that\u2019s going to mess it up; if she was a part of the lie, she\u2019s trouble anyway.\n\nUnless he has an addiction he is feeding, leave the door open.

OP has been nothing but complimentary about her, and indeed provided extra funds to the son to be able to visit her.\n\nThe fact that the son rated buying his new game console as more important than visiting his girlfriend might be a contributory factor in her wanting to break up, but that's all on him.\n\nHe's at university, he has a functioning brain, he *could* work if he chose to - plenty other students do!", "You\u2019re spoiling him intensely.
