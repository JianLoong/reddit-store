You both need to start taking responsibility and be accountable and it looks like you're on the right track. He'll learn (hopefully) in time that money isn't free and now you can be there to help teach him that.

If he is a good student, perhaps he can transfer some of his abilities to meet expectations into  part-time employment to cover his fun money.\n\nIt may be challenging for him to find and keep a job since he has poor work habits and may not have practical work skills. If you have options to set him up with a job, you may want to do that. \n\nYou may have to put some effort into monitoring him if he can\u2019t manage himself independently. Maybe his bank can put limits on how much he can withdraw from his accounts each week to help him budget. It sounds like things went better until you made an exception with his alleged visit to see his girlfriend.\n\nDon\u2019t concern yourself with his relationship with his girlfriend. If she wasn\u2019t part of his lie about the broken arm, that\u2019s going to mess it up; if she was a part of the lie, she\u2019s trouble anyway.\n\nUnless he has an addiction he is feeding, leave the door open.

OP has been nothing but complimentary about her, and indeed provided extra funds to the son to be able to visit her.\n\nThe fact that the son rated buying his new game console as more important than visiting his girlfriend might be a contributory factor in her wanting to break up, but that's all on him.\n\nHe's at university, he has a functioning brain, he *could* work if he chose to - plenty other students do!", "You\u2019re spoiling him intensely.

Pay for all tuition and housing and room and board. She continuously asks for more for spending money - but we refuse. You should do the same at this point.

However, since you asked what you did wrong, I\u2019ll tell you (though your heart was in the right place). It seldom ends well for parents to pay for everything for their children. When a child doesn\u2019t have to work for anything, they don\u2019t learn how to be grateful or appreciative of what they have. They also start to think they can do whatever they want to with your money and there will always be more where that came from. The only solution was for you to do what you did\u2014cut him off.

Man I feel for you, your kids is a selfish, ungrateful prick", "Ultimately you probably gave him too much too easy and let him get away w too much.

He could have waited. \n\nNTA", "NTA. His girlfriend will leave him because of his lies and irresponsibility, as she should. And his threats are empty, threatening to leave but coming back to dinner. And you\u2019re not refusing to provide for your son, you just cut off fun money, If he doesn\u2019t recognise all you do as his dad, reciprocate and say you don\u2019t have the responsibility of a dad including providing a roof and tuition.

Well, think about this.....what is he responsible for in his life? Under the conditions you and your wife had set in place, nothing except doing well in school! Is he doing that? You don't mention if he is attending classes and receiving good grades. So if he is, you haven't done anything wrong....because that is all you EXPECT of him. However, if you are expecting him to become a responsible and productive part of society, you are doing everything wrong. I wish I would have had a parent who paid for all my expenses for college. I worked so many jobs....at one point I was doing homework on the bar where I worked whenever it was slow. I borrowed money which I then had to pay back after college when I got a job. No one helped me. I got a good job, bought my own home (two of them, actually) and raised four children, part of them time on my own. Your son needs to learn how to be responsible so let him get a job for whatever money he needs. Pay his tuition and housing if you must, but if he needs spending money, let him earn it. You are creating a problem that will be with you the rest of your life if you keep this up. He will continue to lie and take your money until you go to your grave.", "NTA but I\u2019m up for adoption if you need a new kid", "I was planning to write what you wrote. You perfectly summarize the situation. But, instead of paying anything, I think cutting off in stages would be better. Such as paying 90% of tuition and rent for the next 6 months and decrease to 70% in the next 6 months. And cutting off completely, say, in 2 years. I have seen such people in my life and I am sure that the only purpose of the son is to leech his parents. So, he won't focus on studying, instead he would try to find new ways of getting money. OP must make a schedule for payments and strictly follow it, no matter what. And he must cut him off, again no matter what happens.", "You must not be a parent. You can do all the right things in the world, but when someone is grown they are going to act how they want. Kids are not robots", "That isn't how it works lol\n\nOnce a child reaches a certain age, their peer group has far more influence on them than their parents. \n\nYes, you can do all you can to raise a child that's more likely to fall in with the 'right' crowd, but you cannot guarantee anything.", "Because your coddling has allowed him to continue to be lazy.", "I think Americans just assume that anyone who speaks English is American... even though the Commonwealth of Nations has more than 2 Billion people in it. Either way, I don't think you've done anything wrong, but I think your son needs some proper admonishing. Like, As I say the gameplay trailer for the new Spider-Man, that sh\\*t has me excited beyond words. Still explicitly asked my parents if I could buy it.\n\nTo clarify, I am about the same age as your son, and in a similar financial situation as he is with my parents (though I do have a job, the money from which I plan to pay off my Uni loans). I don't wish to be presumptive or intrusive, but I think his relationship with you has become strained to the point where he sees you more as a bank than loved ones.\n\nThe fair thing to do is to cut him off and let him learn his lesson, it seems to me that you chose that route, which is entirely fair.\n\nHowever, the part of me that relates with him just a little suggests that repairing that relationship might yield better results. I feel like I could've easily ended up like that, but the thought of my parents having to suffer my actions or suffer for them is too much to bear. \n\nEither way, I hope this wasn't rude, I'm just sharing my feelings on the matter. Thank you for sharing your story, I hope things improve with your son.", "I don\u2019t think it was obvious. All we\u2019re told is that the son moved to Milan and goes to Italian university and his girlfriend is from southern Italy. The parents could be from just about anywhere.", "For sure. I do however thinks it\u2019s interesting that when a good kid comes from bad parents it\u2019s in \u201cspite of them\u201d but when a bad kid comes from good parents it\u2019s \u201ctheir fault\u201d.", "For me, since he \"came home for dinner\" despite attending Italian university, it follows that the parents are also in Italy.", "Or that\u2019s why he ran out of money so quickly", "Yeah, but it's odd to say \"Italian University\" specifically unless it's out of the norm.\n\nI don't tell people I go to \"American College\" or \"British University\". Specific schools, sure, but adding a proper noun before the institution implies there's something special about it, and with context the likeliest context is 'not from Italy'."]}
