You both need to start taking responsibility and be accountable and it looks like you're on the right track. He'll learn (hopefully) in time that money isn't free and now you can be there to help teach him that.

If he is a good student, perhaps he can transfer some of his abilities to meet expectations into  part-time employment to cover his fun money.\n\nIt may be challenging for him to find and keep a job since he has poor work habits and may not have practical work skills. If you have options to set him up with a job, you may want to do that. \n\nYou may have to put some effort into monitoring him if he can\u2019t manage himself independently. Maybe his bank can put limits on how much he can withdraw from his accounts each week to help him budget. It sounds like things went better until you made an exception with his alleged visit to see his girlfriend.\n\nDon\u2019t concern yourself with his relationship with his girlfriend. If she wasn\u2019t part of his lie about the broken arm, that\u2019s going to mess it up; if she was a part of the lie, she\u2019s trouble anyway.\n\nUnless he has an addiction he is feeding, leave the door open.

OP has been nothing but complimentary about her, and indeed provided extra funds to the son to be able to visit her.\n\nThe fact that the son rated buying his new game console as more important than visiting his girlfriend might be a contributory factor in her wanting to break up, but that's all on him.\n\nHe's at university, he has a functioning brain, he *could* work if he chose to - plenty other students do!", "You\u2019re spoiling him intensely.

It's the son who should be responsible enough on his own. He's an adult. He should know better.", "NTA stop playing his games. If he chooses to go no contact, it will be a blessing!", "Your son is an oxygen theif", "NTA. In fact, being lenient is what has turned your son into a spoiled brat. Too little too late, maybe\u2026 But don\u2019t give in. Either you continue on raising a five year old brat, or he grows up.", "ESH. Your son is spoiled and entitled.  And you both raised him to be that way.", "I get your point and I certainly made some mistakes. But I would have bought it for him because he passed all his exams with excellent grades. I mean, the boy isn't just an asshole. If only he committed himself he could do great things. He\u2019s brilliant, but lazy", "Yeah my son told them he broke his arm helping a litter of cats get off a roof\u2026", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

All raised basically the same. One is responsible with money. One is clueless but not entitled about money. The other one thinks the world owes her everything. They all had the same rules, teaching, allowances, chores, etc. \n\nIt\u2019s not all about parenting - believe me.", "This is 100% consistant with standard italian parenting and most kids don't grow up to be entitled liars.", "Sir, I\u2019m having the same situation with my kid in school. Pay for all tuition and housing and room and board. She continuously asks for more for spending money - but we refuse. You should do the same at this point. He\u2019ll get over it or he won\u2019t, but you need to stop enabling him. \n\nThe fact that he thinks it\u2019s ok to lie to you and others to get more money is a big red flag on his character. What is happening is called natural consequences - not punishment. But better he learn now within the safety umbrella that is school than when he is actually cut loose on the world.", "He is a grown assed man who knows Daddy will come to the rescue. When I went to college, my parents didn't reward me for good grades. It is what was expected of me. How is your son going to function in th real world? Once he graduates, is he going to be employable? Will he expect his boss to buy him things if he does his job? \n\nY'all need a reality check!", "Look. Now is the time to be strong. Don\u2019t give him money. You may even reconsider wasting it in tuition too. When he is ready and older you can pay for schooling ONLY .  Stop giving him money and treating him like a child. You have arrested his development and it\u2019s time for drastic\nMeasures.", "Wow. A liar and has good stories to top it off! Tell the girlfriend the truth! He needs to face the consequences of his actions now!", "I'm sorry for laughing, but it's such common sense that you all are Italians so that you having to say that is just hilarious to me \ud83d\ude02\n\nNTA, by the way, but your son sure is.

This sub honestly exhausts me! lol", "True, but the Dad said so matter of factly that if the son had been honest, he would have just bought the Playstaion for him.  That rings of the kind of wealth where luxury is simply a matter of fact.  Entitled kids come from lifetimes of this kind of easy provision.", "Did they come from wonderful parents, or just wonderful people?", "This is the best answer. Pay for college/university if helping with education is important to you. They can manage their day to day expenses. At the very least they can manage their entertainment expenses.", "No one really knows what goes on behind closed doors so good point for sure.\n\nEdit to add; when it\u2019s two siblings though and one is wonderful and the other terrible, kinda points to the fact that we\u2019re all individuals with our own personalities and sometimes nature is stronger than nurture. Though favoritism does exist. Again we never really know!"]}
