Why? Cause you enable him!\n\n\"if my son had been honest with me, I would have bought that play station for him\" WHY?!

Unfortunately you have been a push over giving him more and more money but I find it hilarious he said \"it's over\" like you're in a relationship he can just break up with you? You both need to start taking responsibility and be accountable and it looks like you're on the right track. He'll learn (hopefully) in time that money isn't free and now you can be there to help teach him that. Good luck!\n\nP.s. if his gf breaks up with him cause he can't flash the cash that's on them both (him for living above his means and her for wanting money, IF that's the case).", "NTA\n\nIf you are affluent and he has never wanted for anything, he may think parental payouts are just a part of his lifestyle. If you have never had the conversation about adult expectations (or if you have told him to cut back, but relented when he asked for more) he may not believe he needs to produce or provide for himself.\n\nIt may be difficult for all of you to set boundaries with your son after he has had so much handed to him for so long. If he is a good student, perhaps he can transfer some of his abilities to meet expectations into  part-time employment to cover his fun money.\n\nIt may be challenging for him to find and keep a job since he has poor work habits and may not have practical work skills. If you have options to set him up with a job, you may want to do that. \n\nYou may have to put some effort into monitoring him if he can\u2019t manage himself independently. Maybe his bank can put limits on how much he can withdraw from his accounts each week to help him budget. It sounds like things went better until you made an exception with his alleged visit to see his girlfriend.\n\nDon\u2019t concern yourself with his relationship with his girlfriend. If she wasn\u2019t part of his lie about the broken arm, that\u2019s going to mess it up; if she was a part of the lie, she\u2019s trouble anyway.\n\nUnless he has an addiction he is feeding, leave the door open. Let him get mad and feel the struggle a little. He needs to experience that. Set reasonable boundaries and hold to them. If he starts stealing or scamming other relatives, you may have to clamp down. Keep us posted!", "NTA, and I'm sorry his education has been so poor that he's confused the terms \"father\" and \"ATM\", since that appears to be what he's been treating you as. No longer being recognised as a fount of free money is perhaps not the worst thing on earth...\n\nSeriously though - he's in the wrong, he knows he's in the wrong, and he's lashing out because he doesn't want to have to admit he's been a complete fool.\n\nI mean, take his claim that his girlfriend will leave him because of OP - now how would that be? OP has been nothing but complimentary about her, and indeed provided extra funds to the son to be able to visit her.\n\nThe fact that the son rated buying his new game console as more important than visiting his girlfriend might be a contributory factor in her wanting to break up, but that's all on him.\n\nHe's at university, he has a functioning brain, he *could* work if he chose to - plenty other students do!", "You\u2019re spoiling him intensely.

You're NTA for cutting him off though. He needs to grow up. You just should have done this in the first place and made him get a part-time job to learn to support himself. Paying his rent and tuition was PLENTY of help. He didn't need spends too.", "NTA but this sounds like a true crime story I heard where the son was not only lying to his parents but to practically everyone about almost every aspect of his life. So what did he do instead of owning up to what he\u2019s done? He k*lled his family. Not saying this is gonna happen but maybe you should talk to his girlfriends family and let them know the truth", "NTA.

He needs to learn the hard way.", "NTA for forcing him to provide for himself, but to answer your last musing- I\u2019m afraid that the thing that you did wrong was never to teach him to earn his own money before this point. He expected you to bail him out over and over because that\u2019s the pattern he knows. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to help out - my parents helped me out when I was in uni- but I also maintained a part time job that whole time so that I could fund my own recreational activities. Your son is entitled and he needs to learn that he has to support himself at some point.", "Your son probably made a post on AITA and the judgement stated that you're financially abusing him and that he should probably go NC or LC with you. \n\nHe was also told to be clearer with boundaries. \n\nSo that's exactly what he did. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your son is old enought to learn the value of money. \nIf you wanna pay for university and rent, thats ok, if you dont wanna give him more money its ok as well.\nHe lied to you, he use you and only Talk to you when he wanna money.\nHe said you are not his father any more, so you dont have obligation to suport a person is not your son by his own choice.", "NTA.  \nBut the image of him screaming and disowning the parents and then stomping off to his room, yelling over his shoulder \u201ccall me for dinner!\u201d is kind of hilarious.  \n\nWhat a brat.
