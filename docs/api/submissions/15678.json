Either way, it's no business of that guy, esp since it wasn't his venue, he had zero skin in the game. I'm just curious what your bro's opinion was.", "NTA \n\nSure underage drinking is illegal but for starters breaking the law doesn't inherent tly make you an asshole. Also 18 is legal in my country and younger ages are legal in many places.", "ESH\n\nIf brother wanted a bachelor party with alcohol AND a bachelor party with his underage sib, then he needed two parties.\n\nRegardless of whether the law is stupid or not, it is what it is. You were wrong to put everyone at risk by partaking, and everyone else was wrong to supply it to you.\n\nYour brother\u2019s friend may have been a bummer, but he\u2019s not wrong about there being real ramifications to you drinking in that situation.", "NTA, unless your brother or the guy who owns the place didn't want you to drink. \n\nI don't get all the YTA, it's a private event and the cops aren't going to raid a paintball place cause some kids are there, including the owner's son. Those places are mostly sound proof with minimal windows anyways.", "Assuming this is in the US:\n\n\"is it my responsibility to change my behavior to fit his boundaries?\"\n\nYes.  Further, boundaries is the wrong word.  His \"criminal record\" is the proper term.  If a cop happened by and found you drunk, the others could have gotten fined (or arrested, depending on the state/county) for providing an underage person alcohol.\n\nYTA\n\nNOTE: I'm not here to debate the stupidity of alcohol age being 21.  This isn't the thread for it.", "It sounds to me like this guy didn't want you included to begin with. I will say you are a huge liability if he did buy the alcohol. If you were going to drink there should have been ground rules set up. Like your own brother purchasing your booze and then someone coming to get you. \n\nI'm going with soft YTA. You're not old enough to drink. It's illegal and you could have gotten not only the guys at the party in trouble, but the owner of the paint ball place. Truth is...you shouldn't have been invited at all and if they wanted to include you then no alcohol should have been consumed.", "I am blown away by the judgments of all these good law abiding citizens, clutching their pearls over an adult having a few drinks.

Was the friend\u2019s dad aware there\u2019d be underage drinking there? Were you drinking alcohol that that guy brought?\n\nI suppose it is not that friend\u2019s responsibility to police the party, and I am not sure what he is accomplishing by badmouthing you after the fact. But he was right: you weren\u2019t just drinking under age. You were doing so in someone else\u2019s business. If you\u2019d been caught, your friend\u2019s dad who owns the business could get in a lot of trouble as could the people who supplied you. And if you were drinking alcohol that guy brought, he does have a right to tell you to at least not drink what he brought. \n\nYou were potentially putting someone else\u2019s business at risk by doing what you did, at minimum. That\u2019s the issue. If your brother and his friends were okay with doing that, they are also assholes.\n\nBut you were too. So YTA.", "Did the guy who came up to you supply any part of the alcohol?  \n\n\nIf so, and you got trashed, got behind a wheel, and drove it through someone's front window, there would be a police investigation, and whoever supplied you with the alcohol would be seeing felony charges.    \n\n\nWhose fault is that?  It's his, if he supplied the alcohol and allowed you to drink.  But if he told you to stop and you didn't, then it's your fault and in that case  \n\n\nYTA.", "NTA, he wasn't even the responsible party.

They could face huge fines for your behavior.", "YTA - you are underage. Until laws are changed, you are putting yourself and others in danger of potential liability and lawsuits, etc. So nothing happened this time. But what if something had happened? What if you were injured, or someone else was injured. Do you really think the police or the doctors would say it was alright for someone who was not of age to drink? Who do you think they would blame for providing alcohol to someone who was not at the age of drinking alcohol, regardless of how you or anyone else feels about the law.", "YTA. Because you were drinking illegally and it absolutely could have seriously damaged the business that was kind enough to open their doors.", "NTA if your brother & the owner of the place didn't care then whatever. \n\nThe fact the the legal drinking age in the US is all kinds of BS anyways.", "NTA. Brothers friend needs to chill out.", "NTA \n\nif OP were being out of control it'd be one thing but nah just boozing regularly? At his brother's bachelor party? His friend had a bug up his ass. People are wildly overplaying the consequences in here.

Yes it is your responsibility to change your behavior to fit \u201chis boundaries.\u201d Those aren\u2019t his boundaries, that\u2019s the law, and he CAN get in trouble for knowingly allowing an underage kid to drink there. YTA", "He gave you a very good reason if he\u2019s the one that bought alcohol and knows you\u2019re drinking said alcohol while you\u2019re underage you\u2019re putting him at risk. Of course the chances of this happening are pretty low since I\u2019m assuming no one would snitch but regardless he\u2019s uncomfortable with the situation and when you refused he complained and left. Everyone does stupid shit when they\u2019re young so being and 18 drinking underage is not unexpected but if an adult is telling you to cut it out you probably should. You\u2019re not changing your behavior to conform to his boundaries he\u2019s just enforcing a rule that should\u2019ve been enforced in the first place. I\u2019m all for having fun but if someone isn\u2019t comfortable at the party the general consensus is to either respect that and/or not invite them next time.", "Did your Brother care? If not NTA.

He\u2019s an asshole for telling you to stop, instead of asking nicely, and he\u2019s an asshole for whining about you to others about it after.", "NTA\n\nYes, it is illegal to underage drink but the brother's friend shouldn't have been like \"It makes my uncomfy to see you drink\" when everyone around you was.", "NTA at 18 if you can buy guns, you are old enough to drink. It doesn't make much difference if you had 1 drink or 10 from a legal point if you were raided but very much doubt if that happened. Its a party and 18 is legal drinking age for a lot of countries in Europe and some have it as low as 12 with food in a restaurant. It seems that he had a problem with you having a good time and couldn't just let you have a bit of harmless fun. There's always some joy killers in most group of friends. Hope you had a good time at the party as it sure does sound like a blast.", "YTA.   \n\n\nThe party was held at HIS place, not yours.

Op did not know this guy. Why should he change because the guy was not comfortable? If it was the son of the guy that owned the place, okay. But that wasn't the case. \n\nYes, it is nice to be considerate of others boundaries. But to tell him to 100% stop what he is doing is forcing your boundaries on others. If the guy was having panic attacks, yes, stop what you are doing because you are hurting someone. But the guy was right to leave. It is up to him to decide what he will tolerate. It is okay to ask op to stop drinking, and it is okay to leave if he doesn't.  \n\nWhat is not okay is expecting someone to stop what they are doing because you are uncomfortable.

They don't mess around with underage drinking and this who supply it.", "All the states I know that allow this require you to have your legal guardian there. The brother wouldn't cut it.
