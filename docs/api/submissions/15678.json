A private venue, let alone a paint ball venue is probably not high on the priority to go busting for a lone underage drinker.", "I can\u2019t really judge this one because we have no context as to why the other person was so uncomfortable, I also would\u2019ve left as soon as I realized underaged drinking was happening but that\u2019s because I\u2019d immediately lose my job if word ever got there that I was present. Talking badly about OP afterwards though is totally unnecessary.", "People like you are the reason underage drinking is so dangerous. Grow up. So many people do it and the law needs to be changed so people can seek help if it gets dangerous, not shot down by the \u201cholier than thou\u201d crowd because iTs iLLegAL so it\u2019s 100% wrong", "Except in the US, the person who purchased the alcohol can often be charged with a much more serious crime than the underage person drinking.", "It's pretty funny honestly. It really shows how little life experience people here have. I'm not surprised they're siding with a paranoid killjoy who goes around shit talking an 18-year-old because he got scared. He's probably on Reddit too.", "Who bought the alcohol?", ">is American law that tight?\n\nYou\u2019ve gotten several replies saying yes, but it absolutely depends on where you are in the US. \n\nI\u2019ve had cops show up at parties where there were 14 year olds that were drunk, and not a single person was charged with anything. I\u2019ve also seen a 20 year old get arrested for holding a beer. So it\u2019s really just down to location.", "Yes. But they can buy guns...", "No, they are not. The law could technically be used to get the overage host of a party in trouble if they knowingly facilitated minors with alcohol but it was would have to be an extreme case, the cop would have to be a dick, the judge would have to be a dick, and you would need to have an incompetent lawyer. \n\nAlso, the only person who could possibly be responsible is the friend\u2019s dad who owns the place, and only if he knew and gave permission for an underage kid to drink alcohol in his home. Realistically, the friend\u2019s reaction made no sense and was way over the top.", "Agreed, if they didn\u2019t want him to partake it should\u2019ve been made known before the event. If you\u2019re not supposed to have alcohol on the premises those 21+ are automatically at fault as is so I don\u2019t see the argument over legality\u2014 there are liabilities everywhere.", "The law be damned, ok OP \ud83d\ude44", "I don\u2019t think there was a liquor license at risk. It was a paint hall venue and the party brought their own beer. Are the own party members going to call the cops to report someone there drinking underage?", "Yes, but only if it's your parent, not someone else's.", "Underage drinking on the store owners premises is a liability. He\u2019d be liable for injuries, he\u2019d be liable for the alcohol and the underage drinking and depending on his licenses he could be fined more for the alcohol. Then there\u2019s the willful negligence of allowing people to drink and then shoot each other. This kid could\u2019ve ruined many peoples lives by his need to drink \n\n\u201cDrinking with my brother at home\u201d is not the same as drinking at a private party in a business.", "Isn't 18 an adult?", "Some do, some don't", "This isn\u2019t r/AmIBreakingTheLaw", "That makes what you did even worse. I get it you\u2019re a kid you want to drink and have a good time but your good time has repercussions for the adults involved.", "A teen getting shot with a firearm is just a little bit more of a serious situation than an 18 year old drinking alcohol ...", ">all the people breaking the law should consent to the situation.\n\nCouldn't put it better myself.\n\nIt's not the drinking (I, legally, had a glass of bubbles for New Years 1999-2000, and was under 12, so don't care about the age thing): sub 'drinking at 18' for any other illegal activity and there'd be way more YTA votes against OP. Because at the end of the day, someone realised they could be part of an illegal activity without meaning to, and left when the person committing the act refused to stop. Sure, he had a moan afterwards about it, but I'd probably be ticked off at feeling like I had to leave a party I'd been looking forward to / enjoying too.", "Well, to be fair, he's not just having a beer every couple hours. He's getting wasted.", "Different countries have different legal ages limits of alcohol consumption. Like in the UK, a 16 year old may consume alcohol in a licensed place as long as accompanied by an adult (>21).", "> I think this sub mixes up legality and assholery too much.\n\nI think so too, but when your behavior can get *other people* in trouble with the law the way OP's could, then what the law is has a very strong bearing on whether you're being an asshole.", "Yes", "It\u2019s your attitude that makes YTA", "That's untrue", "Which is why it\u2019s good the guy who was uncomfortable left. But he\u2019s still an asshole for whining about it and trying to make OP seem like a jerk when it was all good by both the son of the paintball place AND OP\u2019s brother whose party it was.", "LOL", "I\u2019m not even OP? Hack my IP or compare post history. Me not thinking OP is an asshole doesn\u2019t make me OP. You and I can disagree, not everyone who disagrees with you is an alternate account out to get you.", "The son was okay with it, but I wonder if the father was aware that the bachelor party would involve someone drinking underage on his property? If he was, he's a lot more casual about his livelihood than most people. Either that or he's friends with the local cops.", "The \u2018OP\u2019 was sarcasm. But I stand by saying your attitude makes you an AH. And don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not concerned you\u2019re \u2018out to get me\u2019 \ud83d\ude02", "I really don\u2019t see how it\u2019s relevant to this AITA. The paintball place almost certainly doesn\u2019t have a liquor license in the first place and I\u2019m not going to hold the youngest person at the party responsible for the fact that there was alcohol on the premises at all. It\u2019s just not relevant, and certainly doesn\u2019t make OP an asshole.", "Can you be more specific about what part of my attitude makes me an asshole? I hope you don\u2019t get your morality from the law.", "If you can\u2019t see it, there\u2019s no point my explaining it. And for people who don\u2019t live in the US, getting your morality from the law isn\u2019t necessarily the bad thing you imply it is", "AKA, I\u2019m just making stuff up and don\u2019t have an argument. \n\nAnd where could you possibly live where you agree with every law? And what a strange view of the US, that you\u2019d think that we have laws that align less with our morality. American exceptionalism at its finest."]}
