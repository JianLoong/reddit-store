She\u2019s single and doesn\u2019t have many close friends, so respite comes from my parents or weekends with the kids\u2019 grandma. She\u2019s been having a tough time but she also wears this like a badge of honor. My sister is an admirable person who\u2019s always done great work; however, she is not always the easiest to get along with and is quick to criticize. She expects a lot from those around her and demands they live up to those expectations, regardless of the boundaries they establish. Here\u2019s the issue:\n\nI was recently in town for our dad\u2019s birthday. Knowing I wasn\u2019t working while there, my sister asked if I would help her at the kids\u2019 dr appts. Absolutely. After the doctor, we met my parents and other sister for pizza and then went to ice cream. These activities are fun, but as anyone with young children can tell you, especially with rambunctious kids with delayed expressive language, it\u2019s exhausting. \n\nAs ice cream wraps up, my sister says something like \u201cthank you so much for helping with bedtime tonight,\u201d volunteering me to help but trying to be funny about it.  I hadn\u2019t offered but I knew it\u2019d be helpful so sure, let\u2019s do it. As we\u2019re putting the kids\u2019 pjs on, she turns to me and tells me the child I\u2019m helping needs her diaper changed. \u201cOk\u2026\u201d I said, hesitating. \u201cYou can change her diaper,\u201d she responded. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d We went back and forth a few times, during which I told her I\u2019d be happy to switch kids, \u201cno you can change her diaper,\u201d and asked me if I meant ever or just not right now, to which I said not right now. She then called me sexist and said my refusal is really wrong and sexist. I reminded her I didn\u2019t choose this situation, to which she said \u201cyou think I chose this?\u201d \u2026 literally yes. We argued a bit more but eventually needed to help floss and brush before bed so it was dropped. \n\nA couple nights later, the issue resurfaces. One of the kids needed to be changed, my sister volunteered me again, and again I refused. A similar argument ensued and ends in the same way, I\u2019m sexiest for not changing a diaper. \n\nOn the drive to the airport an hour later, my mom shared how upset I made my sister, how she doesn\u2019t feel like her siblings accept the kids and how wrong I was not to help. I love my sister, she\u2019s a wonderfully caring person, but take cover if y\u2019all disagree. I get it\u2019s not a huge deal to change a diaper, but 1) she didn\u2019t ask but demanded I oblige making me defensive and admittedly led me to dig my heels in, and 2) I didn\u2019t want to. I in no way insinuated I would never change diapers or that it\u2019s not a man\u2019s responsibility, but I simply didn\u2019t want to and offered other ways I could help instead, which were turned down. I know she\u2019s going through a lot but f me I just wish she wouldn\u2019t be such a dick when it comes to assuming how others will help her before or without asking. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: in the initial situation, I was already helping the girl put her pjs on.

I do understand why you wouldn't want to change the diaper but if she's straight up refusing I'd change it just so the baby wasn't sitting in it. Gotta do what you gotta do...but in this case you didn't have to do it.
