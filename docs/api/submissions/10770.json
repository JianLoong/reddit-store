AITA because I just fired my employee and I am pretty sure I am the asshole for how I went about it, but I am not the asshole for firing her.\n\nI 33/f have and employee 33/f who is the supervisor under me at my store. The history with this employee has been rough. I\u2019ll call her Manson. She is the type where nothing is her fault, always someone else\u2019s fault. She has unpredictable moods, going from 0-100 in the drop of a hat. She has lied about me to our district manager. She won\u2019t call out she just tells us if she isn\u2019t coming. I have personally covered several of her shifts but when I was in the ER she said she couldn\u2019t stay, and closed the store without following any protocols. Any complaints I made to the DM about it was shrugged off.\n\nWell our store is closing in about 2 months. The last couple of days I was off work, we had an ice storm. Yesterday she told me she isn\u2019t coming in, which was fine because I had another supervisor close the store before her shift would\u2019ve started so everyone could get home safe. Today before I made the decision to open, I went out and drove around just to make sure opening would be safe. Mansion\u2019s shift was set 10-4 and I let everyone know we would open late at 12, and Manson should be in to do opening between 11-11:30. She told me over group chat she is NOT coming because she has an interview at 2 and isn\u2019t coming in for 2 hours. I told her it\u2019s not optional and she needs to go in. She didn\u2019t. And I was going to fire her privately at that time.\n\nThe supervisor who did go in texted in the group chat that she needs to schedule her interviews on her day off and not leave us hanging like she always does because he came in on his day off. ( I would\u2019ve went but the kids are out of school.) she responded that it was his choice to come and he didn\u2019t have to because it\u2019s MY responsibility to come because I\u2019m the manager. I then told her it is not his or my responsibility to work her shift and not to come back. \n\nI already found a new job and next week is my last, so I was just done with her constant BS.

You should never fire someone publicly. Especially not in a group chat.  That warranted a private phone call in the very least.  Of course, she may not have answered.

Usually I look at social media before I hire people. I didn\u2019t for her. I found out later that she has an open case for running over a girl and almost killing her (girl had to get flown to a hospital by helicopter with a lacerated liver). Found out she\u2019s a racist, with a swastika tattoo. All issues that were shrugged off when I brought them up to the DM because it\u2019s her \u201cpersonal business\u201d I couldn\u2019t fire her for it because her tattoo never showed.

She can\u2019t get a new job because she almost killed a girl when she ran her over with her car. So she needs to focus on the job she has NOW too. The store doesn\u2019t revolve around her needs, and as the manager it is NOT my job to work peoples shifts just because they decided they don\u2019t want to. She is ALSO in management. If she isn\u2019t going to come because she wants to take off for and interview, how are her SUBORDINATES going to act? And anyway, I have other obligations in my life. I have a child who was not in school today. Managers need their time too. I have accommodated her dozens of times, and in return she\u2019s rude, unpredictable, and selfish.

Do fire someone in private, but usually people don't pick fights with two bosses in public, either.", "I don't blame you for firing her. But I find it hard to be shocked when someone no longer gives a damn about a job that's about to lay them off. \n\nBut seriously, look after your own well-being. You're getting laid off too, I presume. That's got to suck, hugely. It's better to watch it all collapse around you than to let yourself take on more than you can handle. Please stay well.", "She better not use me as a reference because it\u2019s a no from me dawg. Lol", "Thank you, I will. I already accepted a new position elsewhere and next week is my last!"]}
