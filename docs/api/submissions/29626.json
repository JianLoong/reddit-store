I don't have to shove stuff in front of my door, or check my drinks and foods for bugs. Etc. My parents had always been bad with money, always buying and pawning items.\r  \n\r  \nSo two weeks ago, after reviewing my first ever college loan items, roughly around fifty five hundred. NOT THAT BAD I KNOW :D. I decided to check Experian to see if these loans had applied. Well they hadn't but I seen three lines of credit open in my name.\r  \n\r  \nI hop onto facebook messenger, and confront my mother. At first she yells at me for waking her up even though she's sick. I ask her about the credit cards in my name and she admits to it. I hang up on her, what breaks my heart is the most recent credit card was opened September 11th, three weeks after I left for college. I knew my parents were struggling but that doesn't excuse it.\r  \n\r  \nI had begged to come home several times throughout the semester, I lived two hours away on campus and even though I was emotionally and physically abused I missed them. Two of the credit cards I was able to report for fraud and dispute. The third was more tricky.\r  \n\r  \nThey said it was allowed that my parents did that and they opened it when I was a teen with my permissions. I never gave them permission, the credit debt they have on file is now upwards of four thousand dollars. So, instead of paying for groceries for the next eight months I have to pay this debt off.\r  \n\r  \nIt has been such a struggle, and I've decided to cut them off. My sister called me and scolded me for reporting my mother for fraud and accusing me of doing \"worse\" when I was little. (I would steal food when I was hungry) Now my sister, my dad, and my mother are calling me TA.\n\nI have decided to cut them off completely, three days after I had a mental breakdown because I felt so betrayed.

I hope you can find a therapist to help you heal and stay strong in cutting ties with these people.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a fool. What child has to steal food from their own parents when they're hungry.", "NTA. \n\nFirst, research what you can and can't do in case of fraud. Gather all your documents necessary and proof that you are a victim of fraud. \n\nSecond, you should definitely file an identity fraud report, because that \"They said it was allowed that my parents did that and they opened it when I was a teen with my permissions\" is absolute bullsht. You weren't there in person to sign anything, and even if they had cameras, they can't prove that YOU were the one who \"gave permission\". All your parents likely had was some typed up paper claiming whatever. \n\nThird, go to the bank in person and consult with someone. Tell them you had file a report and/or put a stop or a freeze on your credit. If they don't believe you, then they'd best believe you, cuz otherwise why would you be there. \n\nFourth, your college should have an abundance of guidance counselors all over the place. Finance and/or legal related departments should have professors, counselors, or someone who can guide and/or help you. Maybe some centers can lead you somewhere.\n\nFifth, while you're at it, you might consider a domestic incident report too. Ask the police officers about it, because it doesn't always have to be physical abuse.\n\nYour identity is being stolen, and you're unfortunately paying for it. \n\nYou are a victim. Don't ever feel guilty.\n\n\\---\n\nsource: someone i know took accounting and finance, took some law classes, and had worked in a law-related field...", "First of all, NTA for reporting your parents for fraud.  What they did to you was terribly wrong.  You get to stand up for yourself; you shouldn't have to clean up their mess or pay off their debt.  They don't get to steal your identity to spend money you then are stuck paying back.  They don't get to wreck your credit.\n\nAs for the bank, I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think that what the person with whom you spoke told you is correct.  I would suggest that if your college has a law school, you check and see if there's a legal clinic you can use to seek better information.  Otherwise, you might want to call up the fraud unit of your local police or DA\"s office and get yourself some clarification.  \n\nThen pursue whatever legal remedies are out there.  What happened is both morally and legally wrong.  Don't let anyone victimize you -- including your parents.\n\nIn terms of your emotional reaction, I'm so sorry.  I think tht getting yourself into the counseling center and getting some support there could be really helpful.\n\nNTA", "Nta", "NTA. Your abusers are family and that can be especially hard to get away from\nWe're wired to connect with our family; it's a tragedy when parents take advantage of that and abuse a child.\n\nGood luck out there. You deserve far better than your \"family\" has treated you.", "NTA\n\nContinue to fight this fraud. Like someone else mentioned ask for the proof of your signature, because it obviously sounds like a forgery firstly and also you were a minor. Keep pushing to speak to someone higher up until you are heard. You don't want to be paying any of it though as that seems like it would establish you are taking responsibility. Try to post on the legal advice subs or meet with an attorney that offers free consultation.\n\nYou don't owe a damn thing to people that abused and starved you. You also never stole food, your sister is so wrong to call it that. It is a parent's responsibility to provide food for the children they choose to have. Cut all of these abusers off including the sister.", "Cut them off, people like that don\u2019t change. Protect your credit, most colleges have credit counselling as well as mental health services you can tap into. Good luck, and congrats for escaping that toxic mess, you should be proud of yourself.", "Go to your counselor at your college. Don\u2019t colleges usually have a legal dept. that can help students just for this reason? I really think they can help you. Doesn\u2019t hurt to ask.\nAlso, NTA.", "NTA go NC and push trough. needing to steal food because you are hungry is more than enough info to say you should sue them on everything possible", "Okay let's start by saying you are in no way the asshole and you're valid in your feelings.\n\nThe abuse you went through is not normal and you don't have to love them or anyone who excuses it.\n\nYour sister grew up with your parents too so their view is messed up because of the way you two grew up.\n\nNTA", "Your parents owed you a decent upbringing & they failed.\nYou owe them nothing.", "I know.

This is identity fraud. My feeling is that you should be using those words when talking to them and if they are still making you pay it off, you should be talking to someone higher up or throwing the law at them. But unfortunately I'm not super familiar with this process so I'm not sure how long you should be waiting, when you should be paying it off, and where you should be calling. I just know that the company cares about money more than it does about you, and the person you talk to likely doesn't get paid enough to care about anything or anyone, and I know I wouldn't be paying something off if I never consented to having it.", "Well now you're kinda fucked because they can use you paying towards it as your acknowledgement that you agreed you were responsible for the debt.
