Well they hadn't but I seen three lines of credit open in my name.\r  \n\r  \nI hop onto facebook messenger, and confront my mother. At first she yells at me for waking her up even though she's sick. I ask her about the credit cards in my name and she admits to it. I hang up on her, what breaks my heart is the most recent credit card was opened September 11th, three weeks after I left for college. I knew my parents were struggling but that doesn't excuse it.\r  \n\r  \nI had begged to come home several times throughout the semester, I lived two hours away on campus and even though I was emotionally and physically abused I missed them. Two of the credit cards I was able to report for fraud and dispute.

I never gave them permission, the credit debt they have on file is now upwards of four thousand dollars. So, instead of paying for groceries for the next eight months I have to pay this debt off.\r  \n\r  \nIt has been such a struggle, and I've decided to cut them off.

I hope you can find a therapist to help you heal and stay strong in cutting ties with these people.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a fool. What child has to steal food from their own parents when they're hungry.", "NTA. \n\nFirst, research what you can and can't do in case of fraud. Gather all your documents necessary and proof that you are a victim of fraud. \n\nSecond, you should definitely file an identity fraud report, because that \"They said it was allowed that my parents did that and they opened it when I was a teen with my permissions\" is absolute bullsht. You weren't there in person to sign anything, and even if they had cameras, they can't prove that YOU were the one who \"gave permission\". All your parents likely had was some typed up paper claiming whatever. \n\nThird, go to the bank in person and consult with someone. Tell them you had file a report and/or put a stop or a freeze on your credit. If they don't believe you, then they'd best believe you, cuz otherwise why would you be there. \n\nFourth, your college should have an abundance of guidance counselors all over the place. Finance and/or legal related departments should have professors, counselors, or someone who can guide and/or help you. Maybe some centers can lead you somewhere.\n\nFifth, while you're at it, you might consider a domestic incident report too. Ask the police officers about it, because it doesn't always have to be physical abuse.\n\nYour identity is being stolen, and you're unfortunately paying for it. \n\nYou are a victim.

What they did to you was terribly wrong.  You get to stand up for yourself; you shouldn't have to clean up their mess or pay off their debt.  They don't get to steal your identity to spend money you then are stuck paying back.  They don't get to wreck your credit.\n\nAs for the bank, I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think that what the person with whom you spoke told you is correct.  I would suggest that if your college has a law school, you check and see if there's a legal clinic you can use to seek better information.  Otherwise, you might want to call up the fraud unit of your local police or DA\"s office and get yourself some clarification.  \n\nThen pursue whatever legal remedies are out there.  What happened is both morally and legally wrong.  Don't let anyone victimize you -- including your parents.\n\nIn terms of your emotional reaction, I'm so sorry.  I think tht getting yourself into the counseling center and getting some support there could be really helpful.\n\nNTA", "Nta", "NTA.

Try to post on the legal advice subs or meet with an attorney that offers free consultation.\n\nYou don't owe a damn thing to people that abused and starved you. You also never stole food, your sister is so wrong to call it that. It is a parent's responsibility to provide food for the children they choose to have. Cut all of these abusers off including the sister.", "Cut them off, people like that don\u2019t change.

Check out any student legal aid options, too!", "Report it to the police.  Tell them you need a report number to contest the card.\n\nAs for the credit card company, no underage person can be legally held by a signature on a contract signed before they turned 18.  \n\nIf you are in college, the campus police may be able to help you.\n\nTo protect yourself in the future freeze your credit at all three credit reporting agencies.", "If you're in the US you can contact your state's Attorney General to report the company claiming you agreed to it.\n\nI'm guessing you're dealing with a collection agency at this point. They are 100% lying to you and are just trying to scare you into paying them. Credit cards cannot be opened in a minors name at all. At best you can be added as an authorized user as a minor on a parent's card, but the parent is still the liable party for the bill.\n\nStop paying the collector, you owe them nothing. File police reports for all three instances of fraud and identity theft, contact the AG and report the collector to them. The AG will almost certainly go after them because these are the bread and butter cases for their office.", "A lot of colleges and universities have legal departments for students that you can access for cheap or free because you pay tuition at said university.   \nAlso check any law schools in your area, often they have free intake days or at the very least can direct you towards law firms that might be able to help in your situation, or know a lawyer who might take your case pro bono.", "You need to file a police report first. Then you tell the companies that grains was committed against you as a minor, and you need a copy of every piece of documentation tied to those accounts for your records and to present to the police, as you had no Mosley of those cards existing until two weeks ago. Then, find a legal aid clinic in your area to see if you can afford a lawyer. If you can\u2019t, call your local courthouse and ask what paperwork you need to provide when someone committed identity fraud against you and what you need to do.

Tell them what happened so they/you can monitor your SSN. If you've already gotten 2 of the three resolved then that's good. Do you have free legal counsel at your college or legal social services where you live? Even if you had agreed to them taking out a CC in your name you were a minor and therefore cannot consent. You need legal advice. There is a legal sub here on Reddit, try that.", "OP Find out the company name. Call your states attorney general office and ask for the \"registered agent\" for that compan. Once you have their name and address, you can send a certified letter, provide the account number, your name, phone , your parents name and state that you did not give them permission and that they have engaged in fraud. If that does not yield a positive result, go down to your city or county courthouse to the small claims court and file a case.  You will be suing the company and have the summons sent c/o registered agent's name and  address. Write up all of the pertinent details of the case and more than likely someone will call you before the court date and advise that they are removing you as a responsible party for it in closing that account.

They must provide you with these documents they claim to have. Please check with your student services on campus, you may have access to legal aid there. If not, look into Legal Aid in the county the college is in or even the county where your legal address is. But you do NOT have to pay that debt and the debtor is legally required to PROVE the debt is yours. They can't just say it. Also, go to the credit bureaus and lock your credit. You can unlock it when YOU want but no other cards, loans, etc will be able to be opened in your name because the financial institutes won't be able to check your FICO and credit report.", "Back when my Mom had an issue, she contacted the credit card company and demanded they send her proof that she agreed to it. As far as I know, minors cannot enter into legal contracts even with parental assistance.

I've heard too many reports of bad advice from that sub.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are abusive and they have brainwashed you into thinking their relationship to you trumps their treatment of you. DO NOT PAY THAT $4,000! Dispute that too. You say you didn't give them permission to open that card, I would let the credit companies know this. Make them put a note in your file until the situation gets resolved. See about getting your name taken off the card since those purchases are not yours anyway. \n\nAnd cut ALL those jokers out of your life. They will only continue to cause you stress and cost you money.", "Do not pay that debt! Seek legal advice or call the company back. The worst part of adulthood is having to fight for yourself.

You are entitled to clear your good name. If there are consequences for your parents, so be it. Do not let these people gaslight you. What they did was wrong. Anything you do to reverse this or prevent future criminal acts against you is ok. I am all for forgiveness, but in your case I think you need to seperate yourself from these people for you own sake. Good luck to you.", "And if you haven't already, you should freeze your credit so they can't keep trying this.", "Please do your best not to feel guilty! My mother did this repeatedly to me because I kept her in my life. Go through the credit bureaus to report the fraud. File police reports. And go no contact with your parents.

Keep supportive people only around you.", "You're young so of course you don't know, especially as your parents were never going to actually teach you as it makes it easier to take advantage of you.  \n\nBut you should never pay a cent toward debt you have good reason to believe you are not actually liable for.  It can make resolving the issue harder - but not necessarily impossible, keep fighting this.\n\nI suspect the company won't want to put what they told you in writing for you, so may not respond.  But keep records of those emails you've sent them.  \n\nWhen I've had issues like this that I needed to document, I always keep a folder on my computer with .pdf or scanned copies of every document, record, and email (both incoming and outgoing) related to the situation, including my contemporaneously updated log of events, whether originally paper or digital.

I grew up in a similar situation and after a stint in foster care I moved out on my own at 16. I had to legally emancipate myself in order to protect my credit; I recommend you do the same.
