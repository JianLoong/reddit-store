She now will have to put up with the grief until she can leave the house. On top of this you not only got her hair cut and piercings  you did unusual ones that will even get her more grief.", "YTA. Not for the piercing and hairstyle but you facilitated her making choices that both of y\u2019all know your parents would hate/have issues with as a minor living under their roof. So you basically helped make her day to day life harder with y\u2019all\u2019s parents as a bday gift.", "ESH\n\nYou're parents are extremists and I hope your sister gets away ASAP. \nYou're not an AH for supporting her in being herself,  but you can go home and ignore your family's calls your sister is stuck with them until she is 18.

She has to live with them another 2 years, quit making it worse", "Your sister is 16 and can do those things, but know full well that she is going to have to suffer the consequences of those actions for two years on her own.

BUT I am 100% in support of you being an A H in this circumstance. GLAD you did it and are there for your sister.   \n\nIf I know the type of religion/cult your sister is locked into- any chance she can just move in with you? The amount of abuse and trauma that comes from these families is crazy scary (I used to roll with some in the fundie crowd).  \n\ngood on you for showing her the world is bigger than plaid dresses and subservient relationships. See if you can get her out from under the umbrella and on to a normal life.   \n\nOf course you shouldn't take your 16 year old sister to get her body changed without her parent's permission. But F them for raising her in a cult.  \n\nFor those of you unaware of the damage done by these communities - this piercing may have just helped sister start to find her own power and autonomy.  \n\nSometimes we just need to be an asshole to help those around us live free.", "YTA.

She still has two more years of this at least", "Like it or not your sister still lives with your parents and she needs to obey their rules, regardless of what you may think or anyone else. I understand what you were trying to do but all you end up doing was getting your sister in trouble. You don\u2019t longer live there but she does and while you can just turn off the phone and ignore them your sister doesn\u2019t has the same luxury as you. Besides you are 22 and she is 16 so your should have known better. So YTA", "YTA. \nWhile I don\u2019t disagree she should be able to wear her hair how she wants etc, she is still a minor and her parent have the final say until she\u2019s 18 or moved out.", "Definitely a revenge move on your parents, but you threw your sister under the bus and made her look ridiculous.\n\nThat was mean. You had a good laugh imagining your parent's horrified reaction, but your sister has to cope with the fallout  - not you.", "You\u2019re the a hole", "YTA but your heart was in the right place. Logically, not so much. You knew how your parents would feel about these things and basically sent your little sister back into the lion's den. A lip piercing is a bit much for many parents, not just ultra religious ones.", "YTA, you should've just waited until she turned 18. The next two years will be hell for her.", "YTA. The intention was there but the execution is not so ideal imo. As of now until she turns 18, she has no choice but to really live with her parents. While that definitely limits creative expression, I think doing it now instead of later harms her more because now your parents will do everything in their power to \u201creverse\u201d it until they feel satisfied. It may be easier for you because you\u2019re out, but I think it\u2019s important to remember your sister completely isn\u2019t, even if she has your support to help. \n\nAlso, just personally speaking, a lot of piercings or tattoos I wanted when I was in my high school years did not translate well when I got older and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t get them at the time. Your sister may or may not regret what she got but I just also don\u2019t think it may have been a good idea to do this when she\u2019s still young. This could just be me though", "YTA - Why would you even think it was appropriate to put your sister in a situation that she has cause so much tension for herself in a home she STILL LIVES IN. You do not need to live with the repercussions of your actions on a day to day basis. Your MINOR sister does and you did that to her. You could potentially have even caused her to be in a dangerous situation at home.", "Your sister still lives at home. You can escape the consequences of poor decision-making coupled with strict religious family, she cannot. That makes you badly, badly wrong.\n\nYTA", "Yta. \nShe 16 just because she wants it don't mean you need to give it to her. She still has to live with parents for two years why not wait to do this to celebrate when she move out you make live as home harder for you just because you want to make parents mad.", "ESH  \n\n\nWhile I empathize with having overly domineering parents, you can't tell me that getting your sister a piercing like that was solely because she wanted it. A part of you wanted to stick it to your parents and poke the bear. Your sister is the real victim of all of this, she has to continue to live with your parents and you just agitated the situation and left her to deal with the fallout", "YTA she is 16. The haircut is ok but not the piercing. Shes still a teen", "YTA - they are still her parents and even if you don't support their religious beliefs you have no right to decide whether they are right or wrong in how they are raising their children and then do something to defy them especially when it's not even something for your self and it's actually your younger sister. Also, now her living situation might become worse. Welp, Goodluck I guess!", "Hair cut I\u2019d argue NTA\n\nBut I\u2019d the piercing even legal?\n\nAnd did you think about the consequences at home for your sister or did you just live through her for a day?", "NTA\n\nIt was your sister's choice \n\nI would be concerned in a home culture like that though that she is in danger for having done this then returned to the toxic household", "YTA ... You did not think about the long term consequences you younger sister must now endure  even if only for twoore years. I am christian but do not agree with your family's Lutheran esque approach. It is a justification in the control of others and the lack of will power in the men to turn to Jesus in their weakness and ask for forgivness in having impure thoughts. That being said, your actions will affect your younger sister more heavily than you think and probably more than she is truly willing to express despite what she may tell you. Assumtion on my part here, it seems as though you mostly assisted your sister in this action so that you could spite your parents for what you went through growing up.", "YTA and don\u2019t be surprised if your parents don\u2019t allow you contact with her in the future.\nI would be livid if someone took my minor  \nchild to get those horrendous things done to them", "NTA - She could have taken an Uber and done it all herself. You were there to support her. Good for you.", "ESH\n\nYour parents, obviously.\n\nBut you as well.  You've twice remained vague:\"around here\".  I assume this means you took her out of state to get a piercing.  Many states share the law regarding being over 18 to get a piercing, so it's not just the result of a highly puritanical state.  What you did is probably illegal.  Be happy your parents are telling you that you are going to hell rather than sending you to the police.  And you didn't go with the most subtle piercing.", "NTA, that sounds absolutely badass, thank you for being a fab big sister and helping her out.", "NTA, but I worry for her safety in the the community with her \"different\" appearance. Sometimes, these communities can go to extremes with their religious beliefs. Please check on her often and make sure she's not in danger.", "NTA. She could have done these things without you since you said parental permission isn\u2019t needed, I\u2019m sure she was well aware of what she would have to face from your family if she\u2019s ok with that then up to her what she does.", "[deleted]", "NTA. I totally support everyone being able to build their image and find self-identity as they wish. I was lucky that nobody tried to actively prevent me from doing it when I was younger (multiple piercings, tattoo, unconventional hairstyle, black clothes etc), but I also got some strange looks and rude comments from my dad's religious extended family.   \nAnd I said - f\\* them.   \nMy dad once got some effing NUNS to \"pray\" for me... and I felt dirty after it, I took a shower and blasted some purifying death metal for a day to get rid of that disgusting sticky feeling!!   \nUnfortunately your sister still depends on the parents and this might have complicated her life a lot. You probably should have talked all the options and dangers with her more thoroughly in advance... but it was her wish, her decision and I think it was a nice gift from you. If things escalate out of control, if the parents turn cold shoulder on her or even kick her out...thank you for being ready to provide temporary acommodation for her. \n\nI hope she enjoys her new style and I wish you both as little trouble as possible!", "NTA.\n\nBuuuut, as you get more life experience, you may learn that timing can be important.  There may have been huge physical and emotional abuse to which your sister may have, and may still, be subjected to by the cult in which she is living.  They may also force her to sever ties with you.  I hope none of this happens and she can hold on for 2 years, until she turns 18 yo.\n\nAt 16 yo, she can walk away and petition the court for emancipation - going to public school or getting her GED now, getting a job and going to college (taking some career training classes - whichever).  Why not do this now?", "NTA your younger sister had always wanted a piercing and a different hairstyle", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour sister made the decission, you just gifted her the money. NOT YOUR DRAMA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut: You might WISH to tell your parents YOU pushed your sister to do it, and they can not do anything about that, so they have to F\\* off -  to shift the blame away from your sister and to help her out. SHE has to live with them. you don't. YOu can just laugh in their face and end the call.", "Absolutely NTA and please do everything you can to get your sister out of this truly awful situation.  The religion your parents are practicing is toxic and has turned them into appalling people.", "NTA\n\nShe's *allowed* to get a piercing without parental permission, she *wanted* to get it and she *chose* to get it. Your gift was that you took her where she wanted to go and paid for her to have exactly what she wanted done, as was perfectly within her legal right at this age. Not only that, but you probably helped to ensure that she didn't make any mistakes in doing so.\n\nYour parents chose to treat you in such a way that you felt no loyalty to their wishes and so your unwillingness to respect them is a clear consequence of their actions. Likewise, your sister's lack of loyalty to their wishes is *also* a consequence of their actions in attempting to directly control her self-expression.\n\nEven if you *are* blatantly encouraging your sister to defy house rules, you are actually empowering her in the face of what is borderline abuse in most developed countries, especially at her age (not allowing a child autonomy in their religious practice or lack thereof and *especially* not allowing them the autonomy to choose their own appearance.) This empowerment is coming at a key stage of development into her adulthood that will help her find her wings into adulthood and if I had a medal to give you for being a great role model and sister, I would. Keep up the good work and I hope you both have a great time living together when she turns 18!\n\nI just want to add too that whilst others are \"concerned\" for her wellbeing in her social circle, I think you are doing absolutely the right thing by teaching her to prioritize self-expression over social acceptance. Being willing to be a pariah to stand up for your values is an invaluable life skill and having the confidence to pull it off is a boon for your mental health *and* teaches others not to mess with you. Also, with regards to potential abuse from your parents, she has clearly made the decision to stand up to them on her own and would not have gone along with this plan if she felt unsafe (and likewise, if she felt uncomfortable being a pariah.)", "YTA. Religion doesn\u2019t even play a small part in why you\u2019re the AH. Let\u2019s break this down: you took someone else\u2019s kid to make permanent changes to their body. You KNEW that your parents would be pissed and will likely punish her for this. A basic ear piercing would have been bad enough, but you took her to alter her face?! What the hell OP?! Even if the legal age is 16, it still wasn\u2019t your place. Now your sister will likely have to live in hell for two more years, hope you\u2019re happy \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "Disagree (EDIT: mistakenly posted this on its own and not as a reply to someone saying \"...even if you don't respect their religious beliefs\" or something) and prepared for downvotes.\n\nThe information that OP's sister legally got this piercing (though I wonder if she would have had the means to travel to go get it without your support) is important.\n\nYou're supporting your sister to be herself and continuing to build that lifeline she will desperately need when she inevitably leaves that house and doesn't look back. Religion is whatever, but parents that force their will over their teenager's bodily autonomy is abhorrent (not talking about simply forbidding a piercing but equating it to something that requires an exorcism or something is just batshit nuts). Parents that subject their children to ritual cleansings or whatever this is ... I honestly don't know enough about it to claim abuse, but it certainly isn't healthy or sane.\n\nSo long as you continue to support and protect your sister until she can run like the dickens from what sounds like a toxic cult freakshow, and then so long as you follow through on your obligation to help her navigate the world outside of it in the future, I'd say NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was completely her own choice, I just gave her the opportunity.\n\nShe wanted this as a gift for years, often sending me pictures of various hairstyles and piercings she found and asking me what I thought of them.", "This. YTA, OP. \n\nAnd don't try to deny that you aren't trying to get back at your parents. \n\nYou just did the exact same thing you say you don't like about them - forcing your beliefs on them, and used your innocent sister as the pawn.", "16 is legal for piercings in most places.\n\nShe didn't pierce the minor's ears herself, she drove the minor to where the minor wanted to go to access people she was legally entitled to access.\n\nOnly issue I see is the risk to the sister going back to the parents.", "Where I live, people can get piercings and tattoos without parental permission when they turn 16 (with the exception of piercing and tattoos at the more intimate regions where there's an age-limit of 18).\n\n  \nI've also offered her to stay with me for as long as she wanted, but she wanted to go home herself (she's been pretty openly opposing our parents for a while now).", "The OP maybe the AH for throwing little sister under the bus, but nothing the 16 year old did was in any way \"horrendous\".", "Horrendous??? Get the fuck out of here with your personal judgement.

As such, they could call the police all they want, but if my sister wanted to have another piercing tomorrow, she could go to the nearest piercing store by herself and there'd be nothing illegal about it.", "They live in the same city and her sister chose the piercing herself, you're clearly just looking for reasons because you don't like the piercing.", "The difference is, your daughter, your decision.  All it does is make your ex angry, so mission accomplished. \n\nOP is not her sister's guardian, and sister still lives with the parents.", "16 yo are not responsible enough for full autonomy idc what anyone or any law says.

It was completely her own choice, I just gave her the opportunity.\n\nThis doesn't mean anything. If someone decides to commit suicide and you drove them to the bridge, you are an asshole.\n\nYou are an adult, you know she would be in a storm of shit once she gets back home with a piercing. Your sister is still a minor and may not fully appreciate the dangers of her situation but you know your parents are zealots, what if they harmed her for this? You enabled this situation.", "It was stupid, dangerous and selfish. You weren't concerned about the impact it will have on your sister. Did you really think that your parents would say \"oh, this showed us how wrong we were\"?! \n\nOf course they won't. The chances are your parents will tighten their grip on her. What if they remove her methods of communication? Remove access to funds? Impose tighter curfews and stop her seeing friends? Lock away all her important documents such as passport etc?\n\nDo you not understand how it will be much more unpleasant for your sister to live there this next couple of years now, but it will also make it harder for her to get out safely when old enough?!", "My sister wanted this herself for years.

Thankfully my children have more sense. \nBut ultimately I\u2019m more worried about the welfare of the sister.

Clearly she doesn\u2019t think it is horrendous otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have got it and that is fine.

She still lives under their roof, she needs to abide by their rules(as shitty as they are) until she moves out.\n\nShe has already had to suffer  a purification, how much more will she have to go through before she can leave? You should have encouraged her to wait until she leaves and then she can get all the piercing she wants.", "\"If my sister wanted to do a line of coke who am I to say no?!\" \n\nShe's not your kid. You knew exactly what you were doing. Her wanting to do something doesn't change the dynamic at all, it wasn't your place to enable it.", "Because you know your parents don't agree, and did it anyway. That's how.  Of course your sister wants to rebel. She's 16. That's what teens do. You could have made a different choice and still support her when she's 18, but you chose instead to try and get even by using your sister.", "At your age and having gone through what you did, you should know that her choices would put her in a potentially dangerous situation with your family. She is not in a safe space to express herself. It was incredibly irresponsible what you did. That's what makes you the AH. Also comparing it to a birthday cake; are you serious? They are in no way compatible with the severity of the consequences. Give your head a good shake.", "Right, and the sister knew that too when she chose to get a dramatic hair cut. She's not 6, she knows the consequences - I am not saying it is safe for her back home afterwards (see my last sentence)", "What makes it horrendous and why must one lack sense to get a piercing and haircut?", "I think those types of haircuts and piercings are horrendous and that people who get those types of piercings and haircuts lack a lot of sense. That\u2019s my IMO and I know others don\u2019t agree. \nIn this particular case I think it was a downright stupid thing to do because of the type of people the parents are. People who are that religious and conservative definitely won\u2019t take those kinds of things well and I am concerned for the 16 year olds welfare after going home with that haircut and piercing. And OP just left her sister to deal with the fallout on her own. \nIF one of my children got that kind of piercing or haircut I would tell them what I thought of it and move on but I seriously doubt the parents in question will do the same", "Because it's not her kid.", "I mean you just repeated your assertion and didn't answer my questions... Why are they horrendous? Why do people who do things you don't like as a means to express themselves automatically lack sense?\n\nWhat would you say to your child when you tell them what you think of it? I admit I don't have kids yet, but so long as it's not a face tat or something else irreversible, I like to think I would support and encourage my kid to express their personality as they see fit (within reason, and I think a piercing and haircut on a 16 yo is certainly reasonable), not take the opportunity to knock them down and make them feel bad for how they choose to present themselves to the world.", "That's not the question I asked. Maybe see my reply below for more context...", "I simply don\u2019t like them and think that those types of haircuts and piercings make the people with them look like thugs and criminals. \nI would simply say that I don\u2019t like them and that I think it was stupid to get the haircut and piercing. That would be the end of it and nothing more would be said.\nThat is my personal opinion and I know and respect that others don\u2019t agree.", "You literally asked what makes it horrendous and I answered.", "Ah aite, stereotyping folks based on their appearance, cool.", "Shya in response to the comment \"I think those haircuts and piercings are horrendous.\" Not \"I think OP's actions are horrendous.\" Just like scroll up idk what to tell you.", "Yes even in that context. It's horrendous to the only people who's opinions matter.", "These parents are borderline abusers. Isolating their children from communication outside their church community? \"Purifications\"?? Whatever the fk that is! The only thing that matters is that this poor girl survives the next two years and gets the hell out mentally and emotionally intact. Extremist religion is a cancer."]}
