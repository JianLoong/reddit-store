We recently moved in together, and she decided to take the step of introducing me to her dad \u201cRon\u201d (50s M). Now, Melissa is low-contact with her dad, mainly because he wasn\u2019t really in her life growing up, and to be brutally honest is kind of an ass. Melissa and her brother Kenny were raised by their mom, and Ron just popped in a few times per year. He\u2019s one of those guys who thinks his masculinity is dependant on getting women, driving the biggest truck, having the most expensive chain, whatever. Kenny is a bit like that too, but I\u2019ve hung out with him a few times and he\u2019s not as bad.\n\nNow, last week Melissa and I decided to go to a local restaurant so I could meet her dad. I love this restaurant and usually get shrimp there \u2014 they have fire shrimp and grits and also good skewers. In the car on the way, Melissa told me I couldn\u2019t order shrimp. I asked if it was because of the cost and assured her I was happy to treat everyone including Ron. She said no, and that her dad thinks eating shrimp is \u201cfruity.\u201d I guess because of the shape, and he will doubt my orientation if he sees me eating shrimps. I said okay.\n\nWell, at the restaurant the shrimp looked too good to pass up, so I got the shrimp skewer along with a Mac and cheese. Ron kept living me weird looks, and at the end of the meal he said I \u201cbat for the other team,\u201d and only guys who like d**k will eat shrimp. I told him politely that this is totally untrue. And that I am not gay, though I respect anyone who is \u2014 my own cousin is gay actually, and he\u2019s like a brother to me.\n\nOn the way home, Melissa got upset and said I could\u2019ve held off for just one night, and I wanted to sabotage her already fragile relationship with her dad. I got her flowers the next day and we are good now, but what do you all think? AITA?", "created_utc": 1704475538, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18zc9np/aita_for_eating_shrimp_when_i_met_my_gfs_dad_for/", "score": 261, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your gf is a little iffy here though. Why she\u2019d want to protect the feelings of her bigot father to the extent that she asked you not to order your favorite dish at the restaurant is baffling to me.

If her relationship with her dad is dependent on her catering to his toxic BS and general assholery then it\u2019s not a relationship worth having - hopefully she\u2019ll realize that soon. \nGlad you two are ok (as in not dragging this out for days) \ud83d\udc4d", "You\u2019re setting yourself up for a lifetime \u2014 or at least a relationship\u2019s worth \u2014 of having to measure up to someone else\u2019s (unreasonable and laughable) standards of masculinity.

I\u2019m not sure you can or should say that to her at this point, but if you start talking long-term like marriage or kids you\u2019ll have to address the Ron issue together.

Her dad is weak af, well done on showing dominance. I understand why she's pissed (you said you'd not do something, then did it), but unless it's for allergies she shouldn't have ask in the first place. His reasons are beyond ridiculous.

Geez people like this will find any excuse to throw around their toxic values and homophobic slander. \n\nI would also be petty and would've ordered even more shrimp. NTA - your gf needs to realize her dad is the one who needs to grow up. She shouldn't be the one to cower when he's around or ask anyone else to change themselves to appease his fragile masculinity.", "NTA. What kind of weird repressed gay stuff is going through that man's head?", "NTA.\n\nWhat Melissa needs is to acknowledge her dad's toxic behaviour, rather than asking you to avoid a food you like (and thus endorsing said toxic behaviour) to 'save' their relationship.  \nChances are, if the relationship between them is so fragile that her boyfriend liking a food is going to end it (or even do damage), then there's no relationship there in the first place.\n\nThe man sounds like an ass *and* a homophobe.

Jesus eating a certain food determines one sexuality? What in the actual fuck is WRONG with him? I LOVE seafood and I love shrimp, not because of what it looks like I\u2019m asexual anyway, but because of the taste. I get my love for seafood and shrimp from my dad who\u2019s a straight man and been married to my mom who\u2019s  mildly allergic to shrimp for 37 years. He grew up in a 4 boys 2 girls family and they all love seafood and go get crabs at Myrtle Beach. I mean if he was allergic to shrimp, deathly allergic not mildly like my mom, then yeah you would\u2019ve been the AH. But because he thinks it\u2019s gay. Which by the way he sounds homophobic. \u201cFruity\u201d is a micro aggression. I\u2019ll ask your girlfriend why she wants a relationship with a toxic man like that. I get he\u2019s her dad but if my dad was this psycho over shrimp? I\u2019ll be done. I have no time or energy to deal with weird shit like that.

No need to enumerate the reasons why he\u2019s an AH. \n\nBut she already has a strained relationship with him. She asked you to skip the shrimp because she knew it would provoke an obnoxious reaction from her dad and she was trying to reduce the number of potential conflicts in a delicate and high stress situation.

But if that\u2019s the case you should have discussed this with your girlfriend first and made your feelings clear.

We recently moved in together, and she decided to take the step of introducing me to her dad \u201cRon\u201d (50s M). Now, Melissa is low-contact with her dad, mainly because he wasn\u2019t really in her life growing up, and to be brutally honest is kind of an ass. Melissa and her brother Kenny were raised by their mom, and Ron just popped in a few times per year. He\u2019s one of those guys who thinks his masculinity is dependant on getting women, driving the biggest truck, having the most expensive chain, whatever. Kenny is a bit like that too, but I\u2019ve hung out with him a few times and he\u2019s not as bad.\n\nNow, last week Melissa and I decided to go to a local restaurant so I could meet her dad. I love this restaurant and usually get shrimp there \u2014 they have fire shrimp and grits and also good skewers. In the car on the way, Melissa told me I couldn\u2019t order shrimp. I asked if it was because of the cost and assured her I was happy to treat everyone including Ron. She said no, and that her dad thinks eating shrimp is \u201cfruity.\u201d I guess because of the shape, and he will doubt my orientation if he sees me eating shrimps. I said okay.\n\nWell, at the restaurant the shrimp looked too good to pass up, so I got the shrimp skewer along with a Mac and cheese. Ron kept living me weird looks, and at the end of the meal he said I \u201cbat for the other team,\u201d and only guys who like d**k will eat shrimp. I told him politely that this is totally untrue. And that I am not gay, though I respect anyone who is \u2014 my own cousin is gay actually, and he\u2019s like a brother to me.\n\nOn the way home, Melissa got upset and said I could\u2019ve held off for just one night, and I wanted to sabotage her already fragile relationship with her dad. I got her flowers the next day and we are good now, but what do you all think? AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
