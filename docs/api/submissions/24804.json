So I (24F) went to an event last month in New York with friends. While I was there, I really hit it off with this guy named Nick (26M). He asked where I was from and if it was nearby, and I told him no, that I live hours away in a different state and told him which one. He told me he had some friends that lived in that state and it was about an hour from my town. He eventually asked for my number and if he could take me out. I said yes.\n\nAfter that we texted pretty often. He was still really cool and fun to talk to. Last weekend he finally came into my state to see his buddies and took me on a date. Everything was fine until we hit up a  bar. There was a group of guys inside, and one of them spoke with a southern accent, specifically an accent sounding like it was from my birth state. Nick and I ended up next to the group at the bar while ordering drinks and I got the chance to speak to the guy. Turns out I have a decent ear, because he was from my birth state. We chat for a minute until my drink is out, and then I excuse myself and follow Nick across the room.\n\nFor some background, I was born in the south. I spent most of my life in a suffocating small town. When I was 21, I leapt at the chance to move away and start over. I\u2019ve never been happier. Even though I\u2019ve only lived here for three years, I consider my time in the south to practically be a different lifetime altogether. I don\u2019t like to talk about it much, but I do miss the good things. I also never had a particularly heavy accent. People used to ask me all the time in high school if I\u2019d transferred from up north or out west. After three years in NE, none of the locals ask me if I\u2019m from the south anymore. It only really slips out if I talk to someone southern.\n\nAnyway, Nick goes on to crack a joke about how I\u2019m good at mimicking accents, and I asked him what he meant. He said I\u2019d sounded just like that guy and I said sorry, I didn\u2019t realize my old accent had slipped out. He asked what I meant and I told him that originally I\u2019m from the south. He starts getting mad at this point and asks why I never said that, then accuses me about lying and wasting his time. We got into an argument about whether or not I lied (I didn\u2019t) and I asked why it even mattered that I was born in the south. He told me he doesn\u2019t \u201cf*** with cowgirls\u201d and that he thought I\u2019d dropped out of college because I had \u201creal problems\u201d and not because I was \u201can undereducated redneck\u201d. \n\nHe then told me to go hit up the guy at the bar because clearly I liked his company better and left me stranded at the bar with his tab to pay. It\u2019s been a few days and I\u2019m still floored. He\u2019s blocked me on everything, so even if I wanted to talk to him about it or apologize or something, I can\u2019t. A couple of my friends think that he totally overreacted, but also agreed that I lied and n a way kind of led him on. I don\u2019t know what to think. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: this got more attention than I was expecting. Trying to keep up with comments but I have to go into work now.
