So I (24F) went to an event last month in New York with friends. While I was there, I really hit it off with this guy named Nick (26M). He asked where I was from and if it was nearby, and I told him no, that I live hours away in a different state and told him which one. He told me he had some friends that lived in that state and it was about an hour from my town. He eventually asked for my number and if he could take me out. I said yes.\n\nAfter that we texted pretty often. He was still really cool and fun to talk to. Last weekend he finally came into my state to see his buddies and took me on a date. Everything was fine until we hit up a  bar. There was a group of guys inside, and one of them spoke with a southern accent, specifically an accent sounding like it was from my birth state. Nick and I ended up next to the group at the bar while ordering drinks and I got the chance to speak to the guy. Turns out I have a decent ear, because he was from my birth state. We chat for a minute until my drink is out, and then I excuse myself and follow Nick across the room.\n\nFor some background, I was born in the south. I spent most of my life in a suffocating small town. When I was 21, I leapt at the chance to move away and start over. I\u2019ve never been happier. Even though I\u2019ve only lived here for three years, I consider my time in the south to practically be a different lifetime altogether. I don\u2019t like to talk about it much, but I do miss the good things. I also never had a particularly heavy accent. People used to ask me all the time in high school if I\u2019d transferred from up north or out west. After three years in NE, none of the locals ask me if I\u2019m from the south anymore. It only really slips out if I talk to someone southern.\n\nAnyway, Nick goes on to crack a joke about how I\u2019m good at mimicking accents, and I asked him what he meant. He said I\u2019d sounded just like that guy and I said sorry, I didn\u2019t realize my old accent had slipped out. He asked what I meant and I told him that originally I\u2019m from the south. He starts getting mad at this point and asks why I never said that, then accuses me about lying and wasting his time. We got into an argument about whether or not I lied (I didn\u2019t) and I asked why it even mattered that I was born in the south. He told me he doesn\u2019t \u201cf*** with cowgirls\u201d and that he thought I\u2019d dropped out of college because I had \u201creal problems\u201d and not because I was \u201can undereducated redneck\u201d. \n\nHe then told me to go hit up the guy at the bar because clearly I liked his company better and left me stranded at the bar with his tab to pay. It\u2019s been a few days and I\u2019m still floored. He\u2019s blocked me on everything, so even if I wanted to talk to him about it or apologize or something, I can\u2019t. A couple of my friends think that he totally overreacted, but also agreed that I lied and n a way kind of led him on. I don\u2019t know what to think. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: this got more attention than I was expecting. Trying to keep up with comments but I have to go into work now.

It seems you\u2019re less interested in knowing if you\u2019re the asshole than you are about getting another chance with this creep. Your comments are awfully forgiving towards him which is concerning. I expect if you were to continue with him EVERY time there is something you don\u2019t know, he will remind you that you\u2019re just an uneducated hillbilly. \n\nHe made it abundantly clear that he has zero interest in you before leaving you at a bar to pay the tab.

Your friends are suggesting your lessor then them\u2026  that your leading people on as being educated because of your accent\u2026\n\n\nUpdate:  fun fact.  Wage discrimination against souther accents is real https://news.yahoo.com/study-claims-having-accent-cost-194436352.html. University of chicago and Munich both had a study backing this up.  The view point of people having that accent is that they should make 20% less\u2026 because that accent signifies that your an \u201cuneducated redneck\u201d\u2026 which is what that guy said you were\u2026 and your friends are suggesting\u2026", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m also Southern. I still live in my birthplace, but I\u2019m from a small city where folks around here have a naturally weaker accent. When I visit family from rural areas, I get more of a twang in my voice. I also spent nine weeks in California for an undergraduate research program nearly a decade ago, and my accent pretty much dropped entirely during that time.\n\nI never intentionally lied about anything. My changes in speech happened without me thinking, and it\u2019s not like I was trying to hide where I came from. I\u2019d tell anyone who asked, but it never came up much. (I got asked quite often \u201cWhere\u2019s your accent?\u201d when it did come up. It was amusing.)\n\nIn no universe did you lie, nor did you lead him on because what state you\u2019re originally from doesn\u2019t matter in the slightest. Unless, of course, you believe in broad, overarching stereotypes about people from a certain place and think they\u2019re all like that instead of treating individuals as, y\u2019know, individuals? Your friends are out-of-line, and Nick is ignorant about people from the South. He is not a nice guy, love; he showed his true colors as soon as you revealed your birth state, and really, why would you put effort into a guy who would always consider part of you as lesser in some way from being born in the South?

You did not lie, he assumed. You did not lead him on. You are not an uneducated redneck, nor presumably a cowgirl. He was a bigot. There is nothing for you to apologize for. \n\nYou dodged a whole host of massive red flags there. FWIW I was born in a state with a known accent and I have lived in lots of different states and a few different countries. For a while, as a kid, I regularly used \u201cy\u2019all\u201c and \u201ceh\u201d in the same sentence, much to the joy of my Trinidadian teachers (Their talking bird had a Canadia/Trinidad accent.) \n\nWhen I drink, especially if I\u2019m around people from where I was born, my accent comes out. Otherwise it\u2019s fairly generic/sometimes NPR. \n\nMany military kids move around a lot and depending on how they feel that day, they will either give current state as \u201cwhere are you from,\u201d or \u201call over\u201d or say \u201coriginally x, but not long.\u201d", "NTA - if he went off that badly and insulted you that much over (checks notes) having been born in the south and chatting to a guy from your hometown - this is not a dude you want to be around.

Not your character, just because you were from the south at some point in your life. \n\nMuch like a rural person would judge a person as a \"city slicker\" he judged you as a \"redneck\" Except unlike the rural person who doesn't actually know you, he knew you and still decided to just discriminate.\n\nYou dodged a bullet. \n\nThere's a reason why Anti Discrimination Acts specifically protect nation origin. Because that's what Nick did... while being a \"Southerner\" wouldn't be protected since it's still within the US. \n\nAnd he's from or around NYC which is the melting pot of the US which makes him a double asshole in my book.\n\n\n>EEOC protects race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information.", "NTA the dude is a classist asshole and the reason so many folks feel the need to hide their accents in the first place.

I, too, was born in the South, but became Canadian as a child. I lost my accent within weeks. It only comes out a bit when I speak to other Southerners. When my dad was in the Navy, his accent mellowed and never came back fully, despite moving back and living in the South for the past 50 years. And what the hell is with the \"redneck\" comment. You dodged a bullet with that guy", "NTA. Honey, he is NOT a good man. He's a bigot who insulted you and left you stranded at the bar, with HIS tab to pay!

You didn't lie to him and his opinions on Southern women is disgustingly classist and reductive. You do not need not deserve this pathetic excuse for a man in your life. \n\n\nI'm from a region of the UK with a well-known accent. It's never been that strong in me, but I still have it. I spent 5 years in another area with a strong regional accent followed by 10+ years in the RP south. Everyone I meet is convinced I'm from location two. Not a single person has called me a liar or made any kind of derogatory comment about where I'm from. His behaviour is not normal nor acceptable.", "Yta for considering pursuing this guy. An idiot, too.", "NTA. Lots of people have their accent change when they move. I left Baltimore 24 years ago and I still drop my damn Os. Don't even realize I'm doing it unless I listen to a recording. Then I cringe.\n\nAnd you didn't lie. New information became available and you provided a perfectly reasonable explanation.
