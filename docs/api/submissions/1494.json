Our parents died in separate ocasions and during childhood he was my best friend, always had my back and used to make me feel safe and loved.\n\nIn 2014 John got married to Ana (30F) and they had a beautiful girl. In the beggining of their relationship Ana was sweet w/ me and our family, she used to say she dreamt about the 3 of us living together like a family (before they married and had my niece) and that it'd be amazing. With the time passing she started making passive-agressive comments about our dad (who'd died recently), my looks and weight (even tho she is also chubby) but I didn't tell John, he seemed happy and I didn't wanna ruin it.\n\nWe started hanging out more often after father's death and when we were alone Ana would say shit like she was indifferent to his death as it didn't affect her directly. Once she said we had the same mother-daughter relationship... My mum died short after giving birth to me. Hers is alive and they get along despite some fights she vented about w/ me. SILs mother lives 10 min away from them and Ana saw her mum almost every weekend. Ana made me feel bad several times, about myself, the death of my parents, going out w/ friends or even watching horror movies - she said I was attracting bad vibes cuz I like Chucky??\n\nWell, after **a lot** more things I distanced myself and stopped seeing them. Then my aunt told me my brother, blood of my blood, said he and his wife were the ones cutting me off and \"*it was all my fault since I didn't try to be part of their family*\". It broke me. I still cry thinking about it. I didn't know I had to make a huge effort while mourning my father to be friends with his narcissistic ugly-ass wife. I haven't seen my niece in so long, I don't know what they told her about my absence since we would see each other in a daily basis before this. I miss playing with her and hearing about what cartoon she likes ATM so much it hurts. I wanna be part of her life but can't stand looking at SIL and just thinking about John makes me cry. Before distancing I tried to explain to him how I felt, the awful things Ana had done and said and how I couldn't take it anymore. I never wanted to make him choose between his wife, mother of his baby, and sister - whom I thought he loved and considered family. He said he understood, that they discussed mean things she had done before and would talk again but she only got worse w/me\n\nMy aunt is now telling me I should stop being petty and reconnect cause \"*he's my brother who misses me*\" and since most family sided with me cause of this and other things John did/said so now he's practically isolated. Being honest I wanna be part of his and niece's lives but I'm hurt and idk if I'll ever be capable to look at John without feeling abandoned. I think she might also be abusive to him so am I being too selfish?

After that, we cut contact and John, my full brother, told family members they were the one who cut me off because I didn't try to be part of their family. (2) I have family members calling me petty and spoiled asshole because I won't talk to him after more than a year and I want to know if I am being a petty asshole who should get over herself and reach out to her brother who might be having a hard time.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Ana clearly doesn't like you, so she might misrepresent what's happening. Your aunt is giving you information about your brother, but we don't know what your aunt was told, believes, or what her goals are. You haven't been in close contact with your brother, so you don't have a clear sense of how he feels about everything that's happened.\n\nRight now you do not have a solid relationship with any of those people. Maybe you can build one in the future, but you have to take it very slow because if any of them decides to lie or be a jerk, it would get confusing and ugly. The safest means of communication are sending letters or emails, and if things get feisty, remind yourself to wait at least 24 hours before answering.\n\nIt's possible that you depended on John more than he wanted, or more than his wife thinks is reasonable. We don't have enough information to draw strong conclusions, but if either of those is happening, one would expect to see what we see here.", "NTA. Reach and tell them that if they are being abused, they can come to you and stay there. You, however, will not tolerate the abuse when directed at you.  You are not at all the AH for not reaching out to them when you were treated so badly and they SAID you were not family now. Just make that offer, and wait for the divorce :(", "You have a lot to sort out before reconnecting. Find a therapist to mentor you, read everything you can on healthy adult boundaries, emotional manipulation tactics, avoiding enmeshment, dealing with narcissists, and, honestly,  realize your brother is HER husband, not yours... your goal for a healthy adult brother-sister bond shouldn't be a triad with his wife.\n\nAgain... read all the books, use a therapist to give you a set of skills for identifying toxic behaviors in others and yourself, and have a firm,  clear, precise picture of what a normal, healthy, correctly distanced relationship will look like.
