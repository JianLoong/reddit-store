Your brother-in-law deserved thoughtful acknowledgment that a difficult day was coming up, and checking in on him and his children.\n\nYour 1 year old won\u2019t even know it\u2019s his birthday. You absolutely could and should celebrate it publicly on a different day on the year anniversary of your SISTER-IN-LAW\u2019s death. What you and your husband do in private on the day is your own business; but your husband and his family suffered a major loss. It takes a lot to throw a party on the first anniversary.", "YTA-I say this as nicely as possible please learn to read the room. While your son\u2019s first birthday is clearly a joyous occasion and deserves to be celebrated you asked motherless children and a widower to celebrate an event that led to then losing their mom and wife.", "YTA - for calling her 'our surrogate' in the judgment bot. She wad your husband's sister, your sister-in-law, your brother-in-law's wife and your niblings' mother! She might have also been your surrogate but to reduce her to that is to trivialize these very important relationships. I think you have also done that in your head, which is why you have not considered their grief in your birthday plans. \n\nI agree your son should not grow up feeling guilty about his aunt's death but that comes later, when he's older and can comprehend what a birthday is. \n\nIf I am feeling more generous, I'm speculating that your position here is hard, as you have been given the most precious gift in tragic circumstances. If you hadn't asked her to be a surrogate she most likely would still be alive - this could make someone feel very guilty. The way you come across sounds as though you have blocked this out as a defence mechanism, which I think is understandable. Just don't block out these feelings to the extent that you aren't making space for others' feelings too.", "This is a very, very sad situation for the whole family. Your husband lost his sister.  His BIL lost his wife. Your nephews lost their mom.  Also you lost your SIL, which doesn\u2019t seem to be of great importance to you.  Of course your husband doesn\u2019t want to have a party on the first anniversary of the death of his sister.  And your BIL would not be bringing his children to a party anywhere on the anniversary of their mother\u2019s death. YTA, an AH shining like a meteor against the dark skies filled with all other AH. The only proper thing to do is to apologize to all of these people, cancel this party (your son has no idea that it\u2019s his birthday), and hold some sort of small celebration on a different day.  You will still be an AH from what you did, but maybe over time they will forget if you continue to celebrate the birthday on the nearest weekend day until your son himself asks for a change.", "YTA - you just seem to completely ignore the fact that this is the anniversary of your SIL\u2019s death. The FIRST anniversary of her death. Which you are clearly aware of and should have been approaching this with a lot more tact.", "YTA here. I don\u2019t think it was intentional on your part, and maybe you just weren\u2019t thinking, but it comes off as inherently cruel to invite a family to a celebration of life on the anniversary of their wife/mother\u2019s death. You can absolutely want to celebrate your child\u2019s birthday, but you also have to realize that a family member lost their life bringing your child into the world. Neither you nor your child are responsible for her death, but I would hope you at least feel you owe some sensitivity to her family members. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you want to have a positive relationship with these family members that doesn\u2019t result in them resenting you or your child, you\u2019re going to need to acknowledge the loss. Your kid is turning one and will never know what day their party was on. Move the party, go to the cemetery with them, and show them support. And maybe check with your husband the next time you decide to send out invites.", "YTA you invited them to a birthday on the first anniversary of their moms death? How freaking oblivious are you? Their mom is dead because  of your son and you think it\u2019s ok to throw a party on the day she died.

While your child is a blessing to you, to your BIL, he represents the loss of his wife - his partner.  To your nephews, he represents the loss of their mother.  To your in-laws, he represents the loss of their daughter and the gain of their new grandson.  To your husband, he is both a blessing and a curse as he is his son, and the loss of his sister. \n\nYour husband wanting to celebrate on a different day makes a LOT of sense.  The fact that you refused to do so DOES make you an AH... because your child is ONE YEAR OLD.  He won't care when you celebrate, he won't know the difference.   To everyone else, though, they are grieving while celebrating the new child.  \n\nPick a different day to celebrate your son's birthday.  Plan to use a different day EVERY YEAR.  Because the rest of the family will always grieve for the lost of your SIL while they see your son, especially on his birthday.", "YTA. \n\nYou could have done it any different day. Your child doesn't know it's their birthday. \n\nYour husbands nephews will know it's a year since their mum died, and that pain will be there a lot longer than your agro about not throwing a birthday party on the actual birthday.", "YTA.

She sacrificed her life for your child, have some damn respect.", "YTA even if unintentionally.\n\nYour sons birthday is also the death anniversary of his wife and their mom, inviting them to a birthday party seems a tad insensitive.\n\nYou got what you wanted and they lost the most important person in their life, not really a cause for celebration.", "YTA. You are not wrong for wanting to celebrate your son who is entitled to be celebrated, regardless of result of his birth. That said, what was the best day of your life was the worst for BIL and cousins. This is an incredibly hard situation. It does sound like you should have talked to your husband before inviting BIL. This also should have been an invitation that was handled extremely delicately and maybe wasn\u2019t.", "YTA. To you SIL might have only been a surrogate who you could afford to pay so that you wouldn't have to meet the same fate; But to those three boys she was their world. To her husband and your brother she was an irreplaceable family member. It is cold, callous and awful to expect them to Celebrate the worst day of those children's lives.", "YTA. So you think celebrating his bday on a different day was making him feel guilty? You\u2019re just happy you got your baby and the hell with everyone else, right?

Was there an agreement not to contact them?\n\nYou mentioned she passed away from complications from birth. I'm guessing the husband still associates that with his wife's death, and probably has resentment.\n\nAlso, it comes across a little off to invite the sons of the woman who died giving birth to your own son. That's a somewhat harsh reminder tossed back at them when it's only been a year.\n\nI think YWBTA if you press it further. Clearly, the father needs time to process his grief. Also fair monetary compensation doesn't factor into the emotional loss to their family.", "YTA - you put your desires and dreams ahead of the well-being of your SiL and it cost her her life.

Every child does, but really, they do not need to be on the actual day. The nearest weekend is fine and if that doesn't work out because that actually does end up being his actual birthday you do it a week early or late. Once he gets older you can explain to him that his amazing aunt died on the day he was born, so that part of the family is really sad that day, so we'll do the party another day (and you do a small celebration with just the 3 of you on his actual birthday, so he gets cake twice, so he'll be happy about it!)", "yta.

Your reaction is apparently the same as the surrogate's family, but it isn't universal. In the other sitch- the family made a big damn deal about the child and his birthday as a way to honor the woman's sacrifice. The two families bonded as a way for everyone to heal. \n\nStop acting like she had any intention to hurt anybody, because there's no evidence of that. If they didn't want to be approached and her husband knew that, he should have said something. It's been a year, FFS- plenty of time for that communication to have been made.", "everybody made assumptions. nobody communicated. one party does not own all the blame for that. Clearly she misread things. One can make an honest mistake and learn from it without being an AH. I expect she's learned quite a lot from the comments. \n\nIn my view, the real judgement is about what she does from here. She can be defiant or she can be humble.", "This was a beautiful analogy. I hope OP reads it. I know I'll remember it.", "I can totally understand what he\u2019s going through. Although in different circumstances I lost my husband at the beginning of November and although we only had 1 child together I had 2 from a previous relationship and I get through everyday for the kids and I haven\u2019t had a chance to grieve properly at all. What you have said makes a lot of sense to me right now. Right now I need to look after myself just as much as I do the kids. Thank you x", "That is a beautiful way of describing it.", "Well she said no to having it in a different day. Says a lot.", "Thank you. It took a lot of years for me to be able to see all the water theft I was doing could not keep my kids from being thirsty.\n\nAnd it still takes A LOT of work to remind myself of that. \n\nUnfortunately I do not think OP has the emotional capacity to understand this. The way they wrote, sounds like SIL was just an incubator", "I am so sorry for your loss. And I am so sorry if that makes you upset, because I used to get so mad when people said sorry. My anger was always 'did you make him die!? No! Then why are you apologising!?'\n\nPlease take care of yourself. It took a few years for it to catch up to me, and it wasn't by choice. My brain just decided 'you're done hiding from this'. Take care of you, you have suffered a life changing event.\n\nIf you are not ok, you cannot make the kids ok. And no amount of strength or perseverance will change that. It will catch up. I wish you all the best. Message me anytime if you need to. Its been 6 years for me, and I had no one to help me on this rafting trip, I will be there for you if you need it xx", "Sending you some love and hugs!", "Seriously?\n\nThe baby is going to be 1 it's not like it knows what day it is.\n\nEither this woman has mentally separated herself from the situation as a form of self-protection from any lingering guilt or she truly doesn't care because she got her baby and that's all that matters.\n\nI hope it's the first one and she can recognize that and be a bit more empathetic in the future.", "No at all. It\u2019s fine. It does make it harder though. \nI hate when people ask \u201chow are you?\u201d I know they mean well but it\u2019s like how do you answer!! \n\nThank you I am very lucky and have a great support network around me. Unfortunately I also have a couple of friends who have been through the same thing. \nI really appreciate you saying that though and it might be easier to reach out to someone who doesn\u2019t know us xx", "I honestly think separating herself from the situation as a form of self-protection is very likely. The way she put it in her post \u201cshe unfortunately died the same day\u201d suggests a very real level of disconnection from what happened. She died having the baby. I think this whole family probably needs some very serious therapy to deal with this.", "The petty part is like 'HOW DO YOU THINK I AM!?!?!' but the human part recognises the attempt at being there for you. Its hard. \n\nI'm always available if you ever need a stranger.\n\nYou are strong, and brave, and you're going to be fine. You and the kids xx"]}
