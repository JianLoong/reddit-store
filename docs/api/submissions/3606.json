Your brother-in-law deserved thoughtful acknowledgment that a difficult day was coming up, and checking in on him and his children.\n\nYour 1 year old won\u2019t even know it\u2019s his birthday. You absolutely could and should celebrate it publicly on a different day on the year anniversary of your SISTER-IN-LAW\u2019s death. What you and your husband do in private on the day is your own business; but your husband and his family suffered a major loss. It takes a lot to throw a party on the first anniversary.", "YTA-I say this as nicely as possible please learn to read the room. While your son\u2019s first birthday is clearly a joyous occasion and deserves to be celebrated you asked motherless children and a widower to celebrate an event that led to then losing their mom and wife.", "YTA - for calling her 'our surrogate' in the judgment bot. She wad your husband's sister, your sister-in-law, your brother-in-law's wife and your niblings' mother! She might have also been your surrogate but to reduce her to that is to trivialize these very important relationships. I think you have also done that in your head, which is why you have not considered their grief in your birthday plans. \n\nI agree your son should not grow up feeling guilty about his aunt's death but that comes later, when he's older and can comprehend what a birthday is. \n\nIf I am feeling more generous, I'm speculating that your position here is hard, as you have been given the most precious gift in tragic circumstances. If you hadn't asked her to be a surrogate she most likely would still be alive - this could make someone feel very guilty. The way you come across sounds as though you have blocked this out as a defence mechanism, which I think is understandable. Just don't block out these feelings to the extent that you aren't making space for others' feelings too.", "This is a very, very sad situation for the whole family. Your husband lost his sister.  His BIL lost his wife. Your nephews lost their mom.  Also you lost your SIL, which doesn\u2019t seem to be of great importance to you.  Of course your husband doesn\u2019t want to have a party on the first anniversary of the death of his sister.  And your BIL would not be bringing his children to a party anywhere on the anniversary of their mother\u2019s death. YTA, an AH shining like a meteor against the dark skies filled with all other AH. The only proper thing to do is to apologize to all of these people, cancel this party (your son has no idea that it\u2019s his birthday), and hold some sort of small celebration on a different day.  You will still be an AH from what you did, but maybe over time they will forget if you continue to celebrate the birthday on the nearest weekend day until your son himself asks for a change.", "YTA - you just seem to completely ignore the fact that this is the anniversary of your SIL\u2019s death. The FIRST anniversary of her death. Which you are clearly aware of and should have been approaching this with a lot more tact.", "YTA here. I don\u2019t think it was intentional on your part, and maybe you just weren\u2019t thinking, but it comes off as inherently cruel to invite a family to a celebration of life on the anniversary of their wife/mother\u2019s death. You can absolutely want to celebrate your child\u2019s birthday, but you also have to realize that a family member lost their life bringing your child into the world. Neither you nor your child are responsible for her death, but I would hope you at least feel you owe some sensitivity to her family members. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you want to have a positive relationship with these family members that doesn\u2019t result in them resenting you or your child, you\u2019re going to need to acknowledge the loss. Your kid is turning one and will never know what day their party was on. Move the party, go to the cemetery with them, and show them support. And maybe check with your husband the next time you decide to send out invites.", "YTA you invited them to a birthday on the first anniversary of their moms death? How freaking oblivious are you? Their mom is dead because  of your son and you think it\u2019s ok to throw a party on the day she died.

While your child is a blessing to you, to your BIL, he represents the loss of his wife - his partner.  To your nephews, he represents the loss of their mother.  To your in-laws, he represents the loss of their daughter and the gain of their new grandson.  To your husband, he is both a blessing and a curse as he is his son, and the loss of his sister. \n\nYour husband wanting to celebrate on a different day makes a LOT of sense.  The fact that you refused to do so DOES make you an AH... because your child is ONE YEAR OLD.  He won't care when you celebrate, he won't know the difference.   To everyone else, though, they are grieving while celebrating the new child.  \n\nPick a different day to celebrate your son's birthday.  Plan to use a different day EVERY YEAR.  Because the rest of the family will always grieve for the lost of your SIL while they see your son, especially on his birthday.", "YTA. \n\nYou could have done it any different day. Your child doesn't know it's their birthday. \n\nYour husbands nephews will know it's a year since their mum died, and that pain will be there a lot longer than your agro about not throwing a birthday party on the actual birthday.", "YTA.

She sacrificed her life for your child, have some damn respect.", "YTA even if unintentionally.\n\nYour sons birthday is also the death anniversary of his wife and their mom, inviting them to a birthday party seems a tad insensitive.\n\nYou got what you wanted and they lost the most important person in their life, not really a cause for celebration.", "YTA. You are not wrong for wanting to celebrate your son who is entitled to be celebrated, regardless of result of his birth. That said, what was the best day of your life was the worst for BIL and cousins. This is an incredibly hard situation. It does sound like you should have talked to your husband before inviting BIL. This also should have been an invitation that was handled extremely delicately and maybe wasn\u2019t.", "YTA. To you SIL might have only been a surrogate who you could afford to pay so that you wouldn't have to meet the same fate; But to those three boys she was their world. To her husband and your brother she was an irreplaceable family member. It is cold, callous and awful to expect them to Celebrate the worst day of those children's lives.", "YTA. So you think celebrating his bday on a different day was making him feel guilty? You\u2019re just happy you got your baby and the hell with everyone else, right?

Was there an agreement not to contact them?\n\nYou mentioned she passed away from complications from birth. I'm guessing the husband still associates that with his wife's death, and probably has resentment.\n\nAlso, it comes across a little off to invite the sons of the woman who died giving birth to your own son. That's a somewhat harsh reminder tossed back at them when it's only been a year.\n\nI think YWBTA if you press it further. Clearly, the father needs time to process his grief. Also fair monetary compensation doesn't factor into the emotional loss to their family.", "YTA - you put your desires and dreams ahead of the well-being of your SiL and it cost her her life.

Every child does, but really, they do not need to be on the actual day. The nearest weekend is fine and if that doesn't work out because that actually does end up being his actual birthday you do it a week early or late. Once he gets older you can explain to him that his amazing aunt died on the day he was born, so that part of the family is really sad that day, so we'll do the party another day (and you do a small celebration with just the 3 of you on his actual birthday, so he gets cake twice, so he'll be happy about it!)", "yta.

(Either that or she is just super selfish).", "\"My deepest condolences\"", "And the oldest kid probably understood what was going on enough to know that the cousin's birth is what killed their mom.  the 6 year old probably doesn't, but it's completely fair if the oldest doesn't ever want a thing to do with the baby.", "Love to you both. \ud83c\udf00\ud83d\udc9a", "YTA. I can not fathom being as cold hearted and cruel to invite them to a party that basically celebrates her death too them. Honestly they will probably never celebrate your child\u2019s birthday.", "And nowhere does she say my SIL / husband\u2019s sister died to give birth to my son. This lady traded  her death. This lady chose to relocate her pregnancy because she could not safely carry a her own child and be result is her SIL died ( and yup instead of her).\nAnd she has the damn audacity to reveal in joy on her son\u2019s birth and asks that the bereaved ignored the death and only celebrate the birth.\nWhat\u2019s horrible jerk.", "100% her whole post was in poor taste! How can someone show almost no empathy towards a situation like this?? OP YTA", "Trouble with this one though is that it\u2019s not just a coincidence it happened on the same day. Her sons birth is literally the reason. (Sorry about your mom btw. That must make the whole festive season so hard.)", "Even if she died in a car accident completely unrelated to the birth of the baby, having his bd party on that date, on the one year anniversary of her death is insensitive as fuck", "If they have that much money have they never heard of adoption? What is it with people obsession with having a carbon copy of themselves?", "This guy we commented on is a lost cause. Like wowwww. Absolutely zero awareness or empathy", "I can\u2019t even imagine how OP\u2019s husband must feel to know that his sister died giving birth so they could have a baby. The amount of guilt and responsibility he must feel and OP is so oblivious to it.", "THANK YOU.", "Absolutely! It\u2019s like renting out the body of another woman so they don\u2019t have to go through  the danger of childbirth. It just reminds me of the Kardashians. Yuck", "And she gave her life for someone apparently heartless, husband must be in shock at the insensitivity.\n\nOP your husband's sister died for you. His family is grieving. You have a son but her babies have no mother. This is the first anniversary of the loss. You cannot have a family party on that day. It is not a day of celebration. If you want your baby to have cousins you need to be more respectful of their loss.", "Finally somebody else who thinks the same!!", "The baby doesn\u2019t \u201cget taken from you\u201d the baby goes back to ITS FAMILY - THATS THE POINT OF FOSTERING. No one is entitled to a baby, especially someone else\u2019s baby.", "That\u2019s true, and that\u2019s exactly why fostering to adopt is an extremely difficult process and not for everyone, and anyone who wants to keep saying, \u201cWhy not just adopt?\u201d to people struggling to have a child just really have no clue.", "most children in foster care are not coming from good home lives and the number of times kids are in the system until they age out bc we prioritize reunification over providing a stable home life for kids is a problem. instead the poor kids bouncing in and out of foster care to their addict parents or their abusive parents is horribke. kids who grow up trying to take care of their parents/sibkings/etc. kids who end up dead bc they were returned to their abusive/neglectful family. its not sunshine and rainbows. in the uk, they cut parental rights to prioritize the child's welfare (based on what I've seen/heard) so they can adopt out the kids when they're young bc it's harder to find pple willing to adopt older kids.", "No one should go into fostering with the intent to adopt. The intent should be to help a child/children in need. I agree not everyone is cut out for fostering, in fact I don\u2019t think most people are. I think too many ppl view adoption as a \u201cback up\u201d plan and that\u2019s fucked up. If you want a genetic child you should pursue that because trying to fill the infertility trauma void with an adopted child is cruel to the child.", "If it\u2019s SAFE and possible children in foster care should be reunited with their families. SAFE being the main word there and if it isn\u2019t safe kinship care is the next best thing. Cutting all ties with biological families should be a last resort. Kids age out because people who go into fostering with the intent to adopt don\u2019t want older kids, especially older kids with trauma. The foster system has a lot of issues & children\u2019s safety should always be prioritized. But acting as if foster children are \u201ctaken away from you\u201d when they\u2019re returning to their families is wrong.", "Tell that to the 6,000 people who died building the Qatar world cup stadium.\n\nETA - \n\nIf you truly believe in \"gods will\" or what ever \"is meant to be\" then you should also reject cancer treatments, organ transplants, and blood transfusions.\n\nIf nature has a will then we were given these brains and creative solutions and empathy for a reason. And yes that would mean that IVF, surrogacy, and pacemakers are all a part of that will. After all, why give a creature the ability to solve their own maladies but expect them not to?", "That's what I'm saying dude. Some states are \"foster to adopt .\" You CANT just adopt a kid from the system. You have to foster while they figure shit out with the birth family, and if they don't figure it out you can adopt. That is not something everyone can do, emotionally or financially", "Honestly that really bothered me also, that poor family losing their mom/a wife who was trying to do a good deed for OP. Heartbreaking.", "Agreed, major detail to leave out/skip over is WHY she died.", "Okay but you don\u2019t need to villianize the biological family.", "Yeah, YTA. That was very selfish and distasteful. Your husband lost his sister, the man lost his wife and those kids lost their mother.... to go against your husband's request and to not consider your SIL's family is pretty heartless.", "She died so OP could be mother and she can't even have enough compassion for her family to not celebrate a birthday she literally died for the same day publically just a year after?\n\nNo, sir, that does make her an asshole", ">I invited my son's cousins and their father to my son's birthday which coincides with the day our surrogate died\n\nWhat a coincidence, right", "Similar here in Australia. Very strict rules around it. As far as I know, related expenses can be paid, e.g. medical expenses for doctor's appointments and vitamins and stuff. But absolutely no profit. Which helps cut out a big chunk of the ethical issues around desperate people doing what they can for sums of money, and well off people willing to risk the bodies and lives of the poors. \n\nI would be a surrogate for my brother and SIL if they wanted. Her health issues mean she may be unable to carry a pregnancy. I actually really liked being pregnant and had a pretty chill time, so I wouldn't mind.", "They could even make a little tradition with the kid of the birthday day being just immediate family and having the party a week later, with some kind of cute lead up to the event. Whatever reasoning they want to put on the delay, it doesn't matter. \n\nPeople who have birthdays on Christmas figure it out.", "I disagree. There are people in my life I'd joyfully surrogate for, and I'm financially fine. I have a child, he's my joy, and if my loved one wanted a child and couldn't carry, I'd be honored to give that gift. As my aunt carried for her best friend. And I say that as someone with pregnancy related trauma. I don't believe it is necessarily exploitation.", "I feel like OP would have pointed that out if that were the case. Potentially not even mentioning the  surrogacy at all if it weren't related, like \"on the day our son was born, my SIL was tragically in a car accident\" or something.", "In order to adopt a child in foster care, the child's birth parents must have given up all parental rights or have those rights taken by the state. So a child who has been adopted can't be taken away as you're implying, but most children in foster care are not up for adoption and the goal is to eventually return them to their bio families.", "Righr. That's what I'm saying. So when people say \"people who can't have kids should just adopt!\" It's.... not quite possible for people who live in foster to adopt states. I could not put myself through that emotional Rollercoaster of getting connected to a kid and taking care of them and loving them and then having them taken back to their once-unfit family. It's one of the many reasons people try IVF and surrogacy instead of going straight to adoption. Bevause adoption is not just \"I'd like a child please!\" \"Ok, here you go, one child!\""]}
