You weren\u2019t wrong for letting her know your feelings but your response is what makes you the AH. Be a man and get a job. She\u2019d never admit it but you\u2019re probably a running joke at her office", "YTA\n\nFirst off, it\u2019s the correct term. What would you prefer to be said regarding the work you do? That you\u2019re an unemployed mooch? A sugar baby? \n\nA house husband is the accurate term to describe your work and contribution to your family. It isn\u2019t emasculating. What\u2019s the alternative?\n\nYour wife clearly appreciated what you do and recognizes that the home wouldn\u2019t be nearly as good without your work.\n\nWhat makes you an asshole is that you never bothered to share your insecurities with your wife. You never bothered to have a conversation. You blew up about it instead and have now gone on with your temper tantrum and are now officially contributing nothing to the household and are just leeching off your wife. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to be a househusband then don\u2019t.

People who care about each other, even if they thought they were being harmless, stop doing things when asked. It isn't that hard for her to stop making those jokes or referring to you in those ways. \n\nOn the flip side, what do you hope will change by not doing chores and being in a situation where your wife is sleeping elsewhere each night? So now you have no job, you aren't doing stuff around the home for the person working, and the person paying for the home isn't staying in the home. How do you see this ending? What do you think is your role in solving this problem? I'd say the same thing to your wife, by the way, but you wrote in, not her. \n\nFrom what I gather, her perspective is that she will stop using the term \"house husband\" but is firm that she wasn't using it to demean you and doesn't find the term offensive. I have friends that call their wife a housewife, or a stay at home wife, or a stay at home dad, and I can see where any of those might rub someone the wrong way, or not as they are common ways to refer to the partner who...stays at home. She said she would stop, but is defending herself in that she wasn't saying it to emasculate you. That feels like a fair position without knowing how she uses the term and all that, and you seem to want a very specific apology, with no room for her perspective.\n\nYou are clearly insecure about not having a job, so go get one. It seems it has been years since you worked, and I can't imagine you live somewhere where there are NO jobs? If your wife apologizes and doesn't use the term \"house husband\" anymore, it's not going to solve your problem. She is going to meet people who ask what you do, and when she says \"doesn't work\" or \"takes care of the home\" you are just going to get upset. If you want to stay at home, then embrace that. If you want a job, commit to getting one. But not doing chores and refusing to find a middle ground with your wife isn't going to get you much beyond divorce papers.", "YTA man. She offered to stop the minute you expressed that you were uncomfortable with being called a house husband. Why do you feel that house husband is a diminishing term?

Refusing to do any chores is a childish move.", "So you quit your job, haven't looked for another and now stay home and look after the house? No kids to take care of or anything?

I get that you don't like the verbiage, but she isn't emasculating or humiliating you. She is LITERALLY expressing how grateful she is for you.

There needs to be recognition that both are types of work.  \n\nThen have a SEPARATE discussion with her about why you find the term emasculating, and whether that is actually based on hang-ups you have, that you'd do better examining and discarding; and how she can aid in that process.  \n\nShe IS reaping the benefit of having a \"house husband\".  There are plenty of 2-career couples who \\*hire a cleaning service\\* and get take-out all the time.

Or perhaps \u201cchild\u201d - though even kids are expected to help with the chores.\n\nIf you feel that \u201chouse husband\u201d is not a valuable role then the reason for that is that you are underestimating the value of \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d which is what typically covers the household chores. And she\u2019s saying it as a woman with full understanding of the level of work involved so it isn\u2019t a dismissal of your contributions, it\u2019s acknowledging them - and you not being able to see that is you undervaluing your own work not her doing that to you.\n\nBut even if you insist that it\u2019s putting you down, you need to ask yourself what value you are adding to the home that doesn\u2019t come under the typical heading of \u201chousewife\u201d or \u201chouse husband\u201d that makes those terms inaccurate for your role. And now that you\u2019ve stopped doing chores\u2026 ask yourself why she should keep sponsoring your inactivity. You\u2019re not making a great case for her allowing that to continue since you are expecting her to take on the entire practical, financial and emotional load for your home and your relationship.", "You said you worked but then quit soooo I mean you are a house husband??? \n\nBut why is that a bad thing?

Not a lawyer, but I made enough to support us and my ex was a graphic artist who was unemployed for nearly half our marriage...the first stint was about 2 years long and he was essentially a house husband though I didn't call him that he was.  So I can speak to this from Bella's side a bit...\n\nShe doesn't know your unemployment is  bothering you to the level it's bothering you unless you tell her. She doesn't know how emasculated being a \"house husband\" makes you feel if you don't tell her. My ex let it fester for YEARS (longer than he was unemployed) before he blew up and explained it all to me and how much he hated it and how much he resented me for basically \"making\" him do the chores. The way I saw it was I was the one working 40 hours and paying the bills, he should be the one doing his share of the \"work\" which meant cooking and vacuuming.  My argument then, and what I'm suggesting to you now...if it is bothering you that much then find a job...ANY job so you can contribute financially instead. If you feel emasculated because your wife is supporting you and you're left to clean the house then do something to change it....and do it soon before the resentment becomes permanent. That is a hard emotion to let go of.\n\nUp until the day we separated that emasculation from the early part of our relationship was brought up in every single fight we had.  Or if I suggested I drive somewhere instead of him it became a thing because I was further emasculating him. If I put together a coffee table instead of letting him do it - emasculating.  It was maddening to hear that he had been so torn down by his own unemployment that he resented me for it.\n\nSo, are you the asshole for not doing the chores, no, it's immature but not an AH move. But you will be an asshole if you don't do something for yourself so you stop feeling the way you do about your situation...whether that is getting a job to get you out of the house and bringing in some money so you don't have to spend your days as a house husband or getting therapy to address the reason it is such an issue for you....perhaps both.  BUT, you can't be mad at Bella for not knowing how much it's bothering you if it never told her.  \n\n\nEdited for typos.", "YTA.

She was no doubt angry at being confronted out of nowhere, since he never brought it up before, as well as secondhand embarrassed for him making himself look worse in the eyes of her mom.", "Except why? There's nothing wrong with being just a house husband, and the wife never said that, anyway.   \n\n\nShe said \"If it weren't for my house husband, that stuff wouldn't get done.\"", "Right like he is whining she isn\u2019t appreciating his value add but he isn\u2019t saying what that is now that he\u2019s just lazing about", "They don\u2019t even have kids (probably a good thing)\u2026 so he\u2019s just a \u201cstay at home person.\u201d What would he even do at home all day?", "The correct term: bum.\n\nHe is a bum - and objecting to being elevated to a higher status.", "I estimate I do 12 hours of housework a week. I own my own house. Live on my own, but two adults is going to be marginally more work. Dude has it made", "I came here to say this. My work outside the home isn't terribly time consuming, so I volunteered to be the one who does all the household stuff. I'm happy to do it, and my husband thanks me regularly. I know he appreciates everything I do, as I appreciate everything he does. That's what a real partner does.", "I'm a housewife. (Sahp with 3 kids) if my husband said either one of those phrases I'd take it as the compliment it is. Hell yeah he eats well. I cook up a freaking storm every day and he acknowledges me for it.  This dude is doing good work and it sounds like his wife notices it, but he has a complex about not being the bread winner .", "They don't even have kids! I dunno what he does all day but that house better be immaculate lol", "But I don\u2019t see how your personal insecurities that (in this scenario) you haven\u2019t shared with your partner are their responsibility? Like in your example if you never told your husband you find the term housewife degrading then saying he\u2019s \u201ctrying to make you feel bad about yourself\u201d is very unreasonable. Like just because you \u201cfeel\u201d disrespected doesn\u2019t mean a person disrespected you and they\u2019re not at fault for your feelings.", "Exactly, it's not like there's children or a bunch of disabled cats or something that he needs to take care of. He just...isn't working. As an able bodied man. So he's 100% bringing it on himself and then hating the position he's in. I have nothing but irritation for these kinds of people. If he doesn't like being a \"househusband\" then go get a job. His wife is out there kicking ass, if he had half the drive he could be doing well too. But he's not, he would rather just complain about his circumstances (of his own design)  than do something about it. What's insane is that he thinks he's above something (being a housewife or househusband) but not realizing that a housewife or husband- especially that  have kids and manage all of that - are putting in an outrageous amount of work and sacrifice in everyday that this dude can't (won't) handle. \n\nAlso- yes I understand that he moved for his wife's work, but it sounds like they're not out in the boondocks. I'm sure that with a little ambition and creativity he could figure out some kind of work. He said he was a line cook- if being in a restaurant is interesting to him then he can work in one and/ or work there while training in culinary arts to be a chef or something. It sounds like his wife just wants him to do whatever he enjoys, while instead he's decided to feel belittled by her for his choices and then do absolutely nothing. What a guy.", "I wholeheartedly agree. I would find it hard to continue to respect him. WTH does one do all day with no kids or pets? I\u2019d have a rocking hot bod, you could eat off my floors, I\u2019d find an organization to volunteer with, and we\u2019d be eating like a gourmet nutritionist lived here. Sign me up! Call me whatever you want!", "Right? Nothing wrong with it except he is insecure about it.  He needs to change the situation or change his perspective.  The ball is in his court, she only stated facts.  Facts don't care about your feelings.", "I mean animation roles have been pretty fucking minimal since maybe 2017, not sure it matters too much where you are overall, or at all if you're not even applying. But sure, if she moved them to Buttfuck Nowhere, that'd suck in a lot of people's minds.\n\n  Luckily we live in a world where content creation and remote work are a thing. If he's making efforts he might still be able to find something.", "You should have said something the first or second time she said it.", "Yta, you are literally a househusband. If you want someone to support you then don\u2019t act put out when they are honest about the situation.\n\nBy not doing anything you are no longer a househusband and are now just freeloading and using her, yet you want her to apologize. You realize she could just say she\u2019s tired of this and you\u2019d be without a house to husband at, right?", "Why is coming to the conclusion 'I need to get a job' so difficult nowadays?", "YTA Dude I'm a school teacher so I don't work two months of the year. During those two months I do all the house work while my girlfriend keeps working. It's a good system and neither of us complain. There is nothing wrong with being a house husband I get called that and where not even married yet. It's cute. It sounds like you're insecure and it's something you should work on. But if it bothers you that much then maybe she could hold off on calling you that. But don't stop doing your part she's still doing her's fucking do the chores. Also watch Way of the House Husband it's great and it might give you a different perspective.", "YTA. To use current terms: She's (lawyer) Barbie. And you're just Ken.\n\nAt least be a house husband. Then you're both the equivalent of Barbie.\n\n(But only if you drop your misogynistic attitudes. Go to therapy my dude).", "YTA\n\nyour wife was using that term as a compliment and obviously seems to recognize all of the value you provide to your marriage by handling household duties - if you were so insecure about it you should have been a big boy and actually communicated why you don\u2019t like being called a househusband. \n\nand why DO you not like being called a househusband when that, by definition, is exactly what you are? it seems that you\u2019re deeply insecure about not financially contributing to your relationship when in fact pressing pause on your own career/dreams/ambitions to help make your wife\u2019s life easier is the ULTIMATE contribution - one that she clearly seems to recognize and appreciate!\n\nalso, by not doing \u201cany chores for your wife\u201d you\u2019re just showing her that 1) you\u2019re petty and immature and 2) you\u2019re dead weight. if you have still been unable to find a job in your line of work, AND you actively make her life at home more difficult, why tf would she want to stay with you?", "If you don\u2019t like being referred to as a house husband, then maybe you should get a job.", "YTA\n\nMy husband just recently went back to work when our youngest started school. He was a house husband for 6 years. There is nothing wrong with it. It's not emasculating. He did a lot of work in those 6 years and contributed majorly to the household. I have a feeling you're just going with those stereotypes about a \"women's work vs mans work\". You owe her an apology.", "She's doing the chores without you and staying with a friend? Bro she's mentally and physically preparing to break up with you over this. You are in the process of being replaced. \n\nYou're about to lose your incredibly cushy and envious lifestyle because your girlfriend... *checks notes* talked about how much she appreciates you in front of her mother.\n\nI can't believe you have it this good and you're about to throw it all down the drain! \n\nI say this with love: pull your head out of your ass!\n\nShe agreed to not call you a \"house husband\". She had no way of knowing that you would be offended by that (frankly very accurate and fair) term. Therefore she has no reason to apologize. You aren't owed an apology every time your feelings are hurt. You're a person who's particularly sensitive about this specific phrase that would be totally unproblematic to 99% of the population, so WHY does she owe you an apology?", "Get a job, any job. And split the house chores. End of story.", "See, I don\u2019t get why you\u2019re interpreting this as demeaning.  She\u2019s literally pointing out all of your contributions. You find it insulting because you feel insecure about not financially contributing to the household.  She\u2019s not putting you down, she\u2019s talking you up.  If you had kids, you\u2019d be a stay at home dad.  Also a totally valid and invaluable contribution to the household. If you don\u2019t want to be a house husband, find a job. YTA", "YTA - It sounds like you have some insecurities about your job situation and that is 100% on you to sort out, but instead you projected those feelings onto your wife over a completely harmless label. \n\nYou need to come to grips with yourself before your wife realizes that you are dead weight and drops you. Because I can tell you that at some point she is going to outgrow you.", "YTA if she was dismissing the work you do she'd call you an unemployed loser which is what you're acting like now. Your own issues with your masculinity are your responsibility to deal with. What's she supposed to say when referring to your contribution to the household \"this is my husband he does the housework and maintains our home\" \"oh so a house husband?\" \"no he throws a hissy fit like a child if he gets called that\"", "YTA - My brother she could alternately ditch you and stop supporting a grown man\u2026 referring to you as a house husband isn\u2019t wrong, and if she didn\u2019t love you she wouldn\u2019t be doing it. Everything you contribute could be replaced by spending a few hundred bucks a week. Be thankful she sees so much value outside that which you contribute to the house. Meal prep + a maid for a single woman is a lot cheaper than supporting a whole grown man. If you\u2019re really that insecure with the situation split time between painting walls and looking for a job, you\u2019ll be employed in no time.", "YTA embrace it man. Being a house husband is not a bad thing. My own husband is in your shoes and he embraces being a house husband and announces it proudly. He\u2019s aware he can\u2019t get work at the moment but is keen to do his but so he\u2019s proving that stepping into a house husband role. It\u2019s no different to a house wife. You\u2019re emasculating yourself by being ashamed of it.", "YTA \nYou ARE a house husband! \nGo get a job if you don't like the term!", "So if you\u2019re not a house husband, what is your title? Sugar baby? I guess if you have a problem with the terminology, talk about what you want your title to be or go get your own.", "Good luck getting her back, she\u2019s probably done with the relationship honestly just mourning the end of it, cus cooking her own meals and cleaning up her shit and dipping at the end of the night?? Yeahhh offf good luck \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c", "How about appreciate what your wife is dooing? Do you think work in that field for long hours is fun? You are looking for a job you love. Your wife gives you the freedom to do that! And now you act like a damn child and just stopped doing the chores, so she can do it after a long day? Great... YTA", "I hate that you're so right.............", "He will make meals for himself that SHE is paying for.", "This dude married a lawyer and is deciding to play games. Not hard to figure out where the brains are in this one.", "This. His only contribution to the house hold is\u2026. Things he no longer does?", "OP, what is the right answer here:\n\nAcquaintance: what does your husband do?\n\nWife:\n\nA: He is retired\n\nB: He is unemployed\n\nC: He is a house husband\n\nD: He stays at home cooks, cleans and tends to the otherwise empty house\n\nE: Nobody wants to hire him\n\nF: Works from home and run a housekeeping service (for this own house)\n\nG: Freeloader\n\nH: Golddigger\n\nI: Housesitting", "Exactly. His shame and discomfort with the term is rooted in misogyny.", "That\u2019s how I see this. She chose a career in Law, had no problem finding a job, and is supporting the family. He chose a career in \u2026. animation, couldn\u2019t find a job, took a job as a line cook for a while, then quit to stay home and be the house husband. As they say, nobody put a gun to his head.", "I agree.\n\nMy husband (of 31 years) has said many times that he would be a great housewife if I landed a super job.  And he would be.  \n\n(He knows what really makes a man is answering the Fisher Price phone when our granddaughter says it's ringing...)", "He didn't *mention* that he feels that way about the term, he got upset and then said she needed to stop emasculating him when prompted.", "Hmmm. His insecurities are misogynistic? Is that the part where he knows his MIL doesn\u2019t care for him, yet his wife cracks a joke about him being a house husband and then has a good chuckle about it with her mother?\n\nIf you are supportive and respectful of your spouse you don\u2019t attempt to embarrass them in front of family and friends. It\u2019s one thing if the wife sincerely said, \u201cI\u2019m lucky to have OP at home to take care of these things\u201d vs snickering about it in front of him with her mother. \n\nAs a former SAHM I would have been pissed if my husband had made similar remarks about my \u201cmy housewife\u201d instead of just saying my wife or spouse. \n\nThe wife\u2019s tone and apparent condescension are the problem here."]}
