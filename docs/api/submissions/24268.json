You weren\u2019t wrong for letting her know your feelings but your response is what makes you the AH. Be a man and get a job. She\u2019d never admit it but you\u2019re probably a running joke at her office", "YTA\n\nFirst off, it\u2019s the correct term. What would you prefer to be said regarding the work you do? That you\u2019re an unemployed mooch? A sugar baby? \n\nA house husband is the accurate term to describe your work and contribution to your family. It isn\u2019t emasculating. What\u2019s the alternative?\n\nYour wife clearly appreciated what you do and recognizes that the home wouldn\u2019t be nearly as good without your work.\n\nWhat makes you an asshole is that you never bothered to share your insecurities with your wife. You never bothered to have a conversation. You blew up about it instead and have now gone on with your temper tantrum and are now officially contributing nothing to the household and are just leeching off your wife. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to be a househusband then don\u2019t. Get a job and contribute financially.", "LMFAO YTA", "ESH. \n\nIf she is making a joke or even just using a term that you don't like, she should stop. People who care about each other, even if they thought they were being harmless, stop doing things when asked. It isn't that hard for her to stop making those jokes or referring to you in those ways. \n\nOn the flip side, what do you hope will change by not doing chores and being in a situation where your wife is sleeping elsewhere each night? So now you have no job, you aren't doing stuff around the home for the person working, and the person paying for the home isn't staying in the home. How do you see this ending? What do you think is your role in solving this problem? I'd say the same thing to your wife, by the way, but you wrote in, not her. \n\nFrom what I gather, her perspective is that she will stop using the term \"house husband\" but is firm that she wasn't using it to demean you and doesn't find the term offensive. I have friends that call their wife a housewife, or a stay at home wife, or a stay at home dad, and I can see where any of those might rub someone the wrong way, or not as they are common ways to refer to the partner who...stays at home. She said she would stop, but is defending herself in that she wasn't saying it to emasculate you. That feels like a fair position without knowing how she uses the term and all that, and you seem to want a very specific apology, with no room for her perspective.\n\nYou are clearly insecure about not having a job, so go get one. It seems it has been years since you worked, and I can't imagine you live somewhere where there are NO jobs? If your wife apologizes and doesn't use the term \"house husband\" anymore, it's not going to solve your problem. She is going to meet people who ask what you do, and when she says \"doesn't work\" or \"takes care of the home\" you are just going to get upset. If you want to stay at home, then embrace that. If you want a job, commit to getting one. But not doing chores and refusing to find a middle ground with your wife isn't going to get you much beyond divorce papers.", "YTA man. She offered to stop the minute you expressed that you were uncomfortable with being called a house husband. Why do you feel that house husband is a diminishing term?

Refusing to do any chores is a childish move.", "So you quit your job, haven't looked for another and now stay home and look after the house? No kids to take care of or anything?

She already agreed to stop calling you a house husband. Did you ever at any point before that time, tell her it upset you? Or did you just bottle it up until you couldn't anymore? YTA.

I get that you don't like the verbiage, but she isn't emasculating or humiliating you. She is LITERALLY expressing how grateful she is for you.

She isn't \"taking care of you\", because you are ALSO TAKING CARE OF HER.  All the work you do around the house is allowing her to focus on a job in a demanding workplace.\n\nDefinitely if she ISN'T valuing that, she should.

There needs to be recognition that both are types of work.  \n\nThen have a SEPARATE discussion with her about why you find the term emasculating, and whether that is actually based on hang-ups you have, that you'd do better examining and discarding; and how she can aid in that process.  \n\nShe IS reaping the benefit of having a \"house husband\".  There are plenty of 2-career couples who \\*hire a cleaning service\\* and get take-out all the time.  That's fine if you have the money and want to live that way - but the point is, you can pay money for that, or you can have one person who stays home to do that stuff.  The fact that you WOULD have to either pay money for it, or she would ALSO have to pay with her time on top of the time she puts in at her job, should clue both of you in to the fact that the work you do can be seen as having a monetary value.

I guess it depends on how we see ourselves and what facets of ourselves we take pride in. I'm sure some housewives love being called that, and some would hate it.\n\nGoing back to the reversed genders - I think what it is is, when a woman refers to a man as a househusband, there's an undercurrent of \"fuck the patriarchy,\" I think, that I can appreciate on some level. Like maybe some pride in shirking traditional roles. And a \"househusband\" may not feel that same pride or positivity about it.
