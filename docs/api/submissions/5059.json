I am her dad, not sure why everyone keeps referring to me as her mother \n2. Everyone keeps telling me the grade due date is actually the post date. If I was allowed to I would post the link so that you could see that the calendar literally says \"December 19th: Grades Due From Faculty\" and \"December 20th Grades Posted\". She literally admitted to lying that they were due Sunday (today) so I'm not sure why people are so stuck on insistng I'm wrong about that  \n\n\nI'm 54 and daughter is 28. She is home on break from grad school getting her phd. She's only home for two weeks because she says she doesn't have any more time even though she has a month break. That's been a big thing with her lately, she is constantly to busy to do things with us or help us out even though she does have the time.\n\nI got my younger daughter a sweater and it turns out she already has it. I called my older daughter from work on Friday and told her she needed to run and exchange it for a different one. She said ok, she'd do it the next day. I said it needed to be done that day to get the best options and she said she was grading so she can't. I told her that it's not like she can't pause her grading, run out, and exchange it. She said she wasn't going to slow down her work and just said that I should do it when I got back from work that day. I said I was busy to and didn't feel like running out after a long day of work and she said neither did she. But she doesn't have a \"long day of work,\" she's sitting on her ass on her computer all day and doesn't even have scheduled hours to work, she can do it whenever she wants.\n\nToday things really kicked off because I needed her to pick up an online order for a gift for my mom, her grandma. She again used the excuse of grading (she hadn't even started working yet, it was in the morning and she was drinking coffee and having breakfast.) She said that she needs to have her grades done by today but I looked it up on the website and she has until Monday evening so I called her on her BS, and she said she had \"other work\" due on Monday so she needed to get the grading done today (but wouldn't enlighten me on what this mysterious \"other work\" is). I said well tough, this needs to be picked up today so I can wrap it and I was going into the office so I couldn't do it. She said that if I don't want to do it myself, then it will be done on her own time. I told her with that attitude she can stay somewhere else and she said \"happily\" and packed her things claiming she didn't want to stay here anyway but was only doing so because I insisted. She left her gifts and said to not expect her for the holidays and she'll go to her girlfriend's family instead. I think it's ridiculous that she is throwing a fit just because she can't constantly live like she's the only person on the planet but my wife and other daughter is now furious with me. So I figured I'd ask here because my younger daughter is always reading the stories with me. AITA or am I correct that my daughter is self centered and childish?", "created_utc": 1671396364, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp7xtj/aita_for_asking_my_daughter_for_help/", "score": 10956, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A PhD is a ridiculous amount of work because of all the responsibilities, big and small. I don\u2019t blame her for not wanting to clarify the \u201cother work\u201d because you\u2019d probably dismiss it. You are asking her for help, she has every right to say no and even more of a right to say \u201cyes but in my own time\u201d. \n\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong but from the way your post is worded it seems like she has \u201ca month break\u201d but is spending two of those weeks (now I assume) with you. During this break she is actually working (grading and doing other stuff) so this \u201cmonth break\u201d you claim she has is actually not a break at all. It might be a break from her coursework but not from her teaching responsibilities from the last term, likely prep responsibilities for the next term, her own dissertation work, etc. When I was earning my doctorate I got practically 0 break because there were always things to do between terms. Shame on you for turning what could have been a nice mostly-break for your daughter to experience some family time into a stressful experience that she does not want to repeat. I can\u2019t imagine how undervalued and under supported she must feel with you dismissing how busy she is and expecting her to be your errand runner during the few weeks she has where she isn\u2019t directly an errand runner for her faculty. \n\nYou should apologize profusely if you want your daughter to come around again.", "You seem to really not respect your daughter\u2019s career choice. What\u2019s that about?", "YTA.\n\nThere are no breaks in grad school. I'd grade tests and papers on weekend trips with friends. Sometimes I'd have 80 tests to grade in a weekend and it just had to be done. Even if I had a break from one of my internships because elementary schools were closed or a break from my own classes, I still had to do clinical reports, work on my thesis, and run my mentor's lab. I would frequently move up an outside deadline to a personal earlier deadline for myself just to try to stay above water with everything else (three total internships and my part time job as a TA on top of my own classes, on top of my thesis work). \n\nYou're lucky she even offered to help you out at all. If you needed something YOU were responsible for by a certain time, that's still on you.

There is no daily routine and often not even a well defined description of what work needs to be done.
