He has a 24 year old son, Colin from his previous marriage. Colin and I have met several times but he was living across the country until recently and we didn't really get to build much of a relationship. We were polite to each other but he wasn't interested in conversation with me and I didn't want to push.\n\nColin\\*\\* (edited) recently got an opportunity for a very good job in our area and so moved back to our state and has been living with us since the beginning of the year. The intention was for him to stay here for \\~6 months while he acclimates back to the area and finds his own housing.\n\nMy husband works on oil rigs so his schedule is 2 weeks on, 3 weeks off. He went back to work 8 days ago and it has been just me and Colin at home.\n\nColin is polite to me when his father is around but he's completely different when he's not here. He goes out of his way to eat my food (I have celiac disease so I have specific foods that I've asked him not to touch). He calls me a bitch when I tell him he needs to do his own dishes or pick up the clothes he leaves on the bathroom floor. He puts my cat outside if he meows. He stays up late shouting while playing games and tells me to stfu if I ask him to stop.\n\nI'm so sick of this shit already and I am keeping myself under control but I'm going to blow up soon. I'm tired of being called names by a grown ass man who contributes nothing. I'm sick of picking up boxers and washing extra dishes. I'm not doing it any more. If Victor wants him to stay when he's home then that's a different argument but I'm not putting up with it on my own time anymore. He has to find somewhere else to stay during Victor's work weeks. Or I'm setting up cameras all of the house because Victor only sees one side of him and doesn't seem to fully believe me when I tell him how Colin treats me.\n\nI was talking with my friend to sort out my thoughts before I bring it up with Victor and she was adamant that I couldn't do that, that it wasn't fair to kick him out of his fathers house and that I have to deal with it because that's what happens when you marry someone with kids. I think this goes way past the \"kid adjusting to new spouse\" phase and I don't believe I have obligations to be treated like garbage in my own home.", "created_utc": 1675898399, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xeay2/wibta_if_i_told_my_adult_stepson_that_he_has_to/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Put cameras up to protect yourself and get the proof you\u2019ll need when you tell your husband you want his son out of the house. Have someone with you when you tell him and until he\u2019s gone.

I think overtly putting up cameras would be bad optics if your husband already doesn't believe you -- I'm assuming you've tried to tell him about this? I also think Colin would only be more careful if there were cameras around. I would start just taking photos and/or recording conversations to document these instances. Whether recording conversations where you are is legal, I'm not sure, but I'd be shocked if recording a conversation just to show your husband would lead to legal issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf your husband sees/hears how Colin speaks to you & nothing changes though?
