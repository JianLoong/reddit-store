Now my friends are angry at me.\n\n**Backstory**\n\nFood is an extremely sensitive topic for me(23M). Ever since I was a child, most foods taste disgusting. I am not sure why but it has affected me all through out my life. I think its due to PTSD from my parents starving me or doing things to my food. When I started dating my boyfriend(22M), he was extremely considerate of this issue and it took years for me to finally get use to his cooking.\n\nOther foods taste repulsive and make me very uncomfortable. When I eat foods made by someone that I don't trust and/or someone whom I haven't worked with through my issue it causes me immense pain.\n\n**Why I could be TA**\n\nI was visiting friends out of town when my friend's girlfriend (Just graduated from culinary school) made food for everyone. I said that I would eat my own food and took out a lunchbox my boyfriend provided me. Before I went to eat I washed my hands, and when I came back I just started eating. The food tasted weird and I had a bad feeling. That's when I said the food tasted different (didn't want to insult my bf so I said that).\n\nAfter I said that, my friends gf said that she made it. That's when I excused myself from the table. My friend followed me and asked what was up. After a bit of talking we got into an argument which then I said that the food was disgusting and I hated it and she shouldn't have been a chef(yes I know this was not nice). My friends gf got sad and left. Now my friends are blowing up my phone calling me an asshole.\n\nSo reddit AITA for getting mad and insulting my friends gf?\n\nEdit: I have been going to therapy for many years, its gotten better but still not solved\n\nEdit 2: Everyone knew of this problem, they also the opened my lunchbox and swapped the food and closed the lunchbox.\n\nEdit 3: My boyfriend did not help with this \"prank\", he made pasta since I said I wanted italian food as that was my friends gf's expertise, he didnt know who I was hanging out with though\n\nEdit 4: my bf was not there\n\nEdit 5: when I said you shouldn't be a chef I meant professionally, since she couldn't respect boundaries.", "created_utc": 1672796395, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102q952/aita_for_bringing_my_own_food_to_an_event_and/", "score": 889, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So it's not all just in her head.", "It\u2019s not even abuse to say she shouldn\u2019t be a chef though. She actually should not.

No one should be a chef if they will tamper with food because of their ego", "[removed]", "You are so right.  A family friend went into anaphylactic shock after eating at a place where the chef thought it'd be acceptable to use a shellfish-based broth in place of the one stated on the menu.

I knew I had a slight strawberry allergy (I get a rash/hives), but the anaphylactic reaction from kiwi was definitely not expected at the time. Luckily, I always have benadryl on hand because of the strawberry allergy and was able to take some before the situation became worse. \n\nAnd if someone decided to \u201cprank\u201d me by putting either one in my food, that would be the last time we\u2019d be sharing any time together, let alone a meal. \n\nNTA OP.", "A friend of mine ordered fried chicken, fried in peanut oil, from a place he ordered from a hundred times. He DIED after anaphylactic shock put him in a coma.", "Pasta is usually either white or red in appearance. Usually a simple mixture of tomato sauce and noodles. It's easy to taste and look very similar. You're acting like the author's boyfriend is going to make a 10 ingredient pasta or something with special addins like apples and rats tails that can never be replicated.\n\nThe host had pasta. She had pasta. She left for 10 minutes. The host opened the container, dumped out the pasta. Then put the chef's pasta in there. No cleaning necessary. Just put a scoop of about the same amount. It must have looked similar and tasted pretty similar for her not to notice. There's no elaborate plating or extra containers. Just 1 container in 1 lunchbox replaced. Then the lunchbox was most likely zipped closed. This person did notice a difference and asked about it, but they are not going to be able to visually tell the difference between a red bowl of pasta made by their partners or someone else's. It's too simple. \n\nEven if it was improbable, it's still possible. In that case, you risk hurting someone with very real traumas. If it's not true and the person is really lying, they won't care that you called out BS. It's also more unlikely that people are going to make up stories to get strangers' attention on the internet than it is to have someone switch out your lunch. High risk, no reward. Why do you feel the need to call the story BS? What are you trying to accomplish?"]}
