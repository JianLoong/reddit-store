I am not sure why but it has affected me all through out my life. I think its due to PTSD from my parents starving me or doing things to my food.

I said that I would eat my own food and took out a lunchbox my boyfriend provided me. Before I went to eat I washed my hands, and when I came back I just started eating. The food tasted weird and I had a bad feeling. That's when I said the food tasted different (didn't want to insult my bf so I said that).\n\nAfter I said that, my friends gf said that she made it. That's when I excused myself from the table. My friend followed me and asked what was up. After a bit of talking we got into an argument which then I said that the food was disgusting and I hated it and she shouldn't have been a chef(yes I know this was not nice). My friends gf got sad and left. Now my friends are blowing up my phone calling me an asshole.\n\nSo reddit AITA for getting mad and insulting my friends gf?\n\nEdit: I have been going to therapy for many years, its gotten better but still not solved\n\nEdit 2: Everyone knew of this problem, they also the opened my lunchbox and swapped the food and closed the lunchbox.", "created_utc": 1672796395, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102q952/aita_for_bringing_my_own_food_to_an_event_and/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
