Please learn about parentification [here](https://i0.wp.com/hopefulpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Parentification-Signs.png?resize=512%2C768&ssl=1) because what you have been forced to do for so long is abuse. \n\nThe fact that the mother of the household doesn't know how to raise children, yet her child does, is saddening.

You're still legally a minor though and expecting you to behave like a parent is INCREDIBLY detrimental to you and your family's dynamic.

I do think that you should help your mom with chores around the house but she needs to appreciate what you are doing as well.  You say your dad isn't at home a lot so do you think he realizes how overwhelmed your mom is?", "NTA. She needed to learn this lesson \u2026 but you need new friends!", "NTA. Your mother is the parent in the household so she is responsible for raising you and your siblings. Not you. From what you have written, your mother is the one that is just plain lazy and useless.

Maybe now she won't insult you. This is way past she owes you an apology. She needs to apologize and then she needs to stop dumping chores on you when three other people are available and agree that you are not her back up co parent/spouse. You need actual schedules and clear actions. \n\n>I texted my friends about this and they said I should At least help her a little since she doesnt know what shes doing and how its selfish for me to \"abandon\" her since she birthed them\n\nA 15 year old is being told she has to help her adult mother because your mother doesn't know what she is doing. That clearly means you took on too much work and also, heck no. NTA. Enjoy your trip! Mom can raise her kids.", "NTA for not taking care of your siblings full time. However you live in that house too and should be doing some chores. Your own laundry, dishes etc. You contribute to the household equally as the others who live there. Your mom sounds toxic. It's not your fault she had more children than she can handle and that responsibility should not be put on your shoulders.", "NTA for going on the trip with your friends for the weekend.\n\nESH for not being able to handle the situation and reconcile. I'd put more blame on your mother though as she's the adult and obviously found out the hard way that you're far from being useless and lazy. And I could understand that you don't feel like starting to help her again unless she apologizes.", "ESH\n\nShe was clearly wrong for taking all of the things that you do for granted and blowing off your trip, which she clearly agreed to.  I think you've more than made your point though, and she has realized how important that you actually are, so it's time to forgive her and let it go.\n\nNow would be the time for you two to have a good heart-to-heart talk about your responsibilities around the house, how you feel unappreciated, etc.  You're in a good position to bargain because right now she sounds desperate for help.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
