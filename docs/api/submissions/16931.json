The joke centers around my younger brother and I. (My younger brother is 5 years younger than me.)\n\nMy younger brother has always been gullible and we played a prank on him when he was about 4. He had looked into a bakery box of cake and we yelled that there was a snake. My bro became terrified and fell out of his chair.\n\nThe second prank was when my bro and I were play wrestling. He was 5 and I was 10. He has always been way too loud, so as I was on top of him I ran to the kitchen. I covered my hand with hot sauce and when he yelled again I covered his mouth. He burst into tears, but honestly, it was pretty funny.\n\nRecently my brother said these jokes aren't funny and stopped coming to family dinners. He's apparently \"in therapy\" and is deeply traumatized.\n\nHalf of my family said it's just what kids do and the other half says we should apologize.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1683749412, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13e1r4u/aita_over_a_harmless_prank/", "score": 137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Having been the younger sibling, I do actually have some trauma from \u2018pranks\u2019 my brother played on me when I was a similar age to your brother - from terrorising me at night by hiding fake spiders in my bed, knowing I\u2019d scream the house down and be too afraid to sleep, to physically pinning me down and using his strength against me to scare me or to humiliate me in front of others, or pushing me over without warning, or spraying air freshener in my face til I gagged and sometimes got nosebleeds. \n\nWhat you see as a prank, the small child on the receiving end sees as someone they\u2019re supposed to trust either physically hurting them (like with the hot sauce) or demeaning and humiliating them for their own entertainment. When I was 4/5 I was very trusting of my brother. I looked up to him. I can distinctly remember one of his earliest pranks, when he pushed me off my bed so that I fell face first into a wooden drawer below the bed, and I got a bloody nose. I can remember being hurt and confused as to why someone who I loved had wanted to hurt me and thought it was funny. \n\nI\u2019m also someone who is called gullible - it turns out I\u2019m autistic and I take people literally. So as a kid, I never saw the punchlines of these \u2018pranks\u2019 coming, and I always trusted people. As a result, I actually don\u2019t have a lot of trust in any of the people who \u2018pranked\u2019 me in harmful ways now. \n\nI\u2019m going to guess that you\u2019re the oldest and weren\u2019t on the receiving end of any \u2018pranks\u2019 like this from a sibling?", "YTA\n\nYou are **five years older** than your brother.\n\nA nine year old playing a mean prank on a four year old sibling isn't funny. It wouldn't be funny even if the kids were the same age, but it's especially horrible here because the age difference is so large. Same goes for a ten year old who holds his five year old brother down and covers his mouth with hot sauce when he tries to scream. Huge size difference. Huge strength difference.

I would cry and ask them to stop and they would tell me I had no sense of humor. I would go to my parents for help and was told they were laughing with me, not at me. Sometimes my parents would even join in on the jokes. Then I started gaining weight and it got worse; they were able to add fat jokes to the roster. I was traumatized by my family and coped by developing an eating disorder and comorbid addictions that lasted 25 years. It\u2019s not harmless.

If this guy can only bring up shit he did as a pre-teen, he seems like an absolute amazing person to spend time around. OP, YTA, you *tortured* your younger brother, you didnt prank him, grow tf up.", "Thank you for this. I was in my 60\u2019s when I realized my brothers who loved me dearly, also bullied me with relentless teasing. I have triggers my poor husband runs into.

It may have been jokes to you and your family but they impacted him negatively. \"It could have been worse\", it's no wonder he has stopped coming to family events. If you don't think those \"pranks\" were cruel enough, knowing you have the capacity to have made it even worse on him shows you are awful. You are invalidating him. He's traumatized, it's not on you to tell him that it could have been worse, it was bad enough for him for it to traumatize him. Instead of dismissing him, maybe listen to what he has to say and really hear him out. Sometimes just taking it on the chin and stopping the jokes, and validating his feelings could have a greater impact. It's the continual indifference for his feelings that keep him talking about it.

Just because he's doing well for himself doesn't mean that emotionally or mentally things from his childhood don't weigh on him.  You have no idea how it impacts other aspects of his life, other interpersonal relationships, etc. Would it be better if he was currently not doing well? Would it make a difference to you or you and your family's ability to stop being bullies? I have a feeling you all tend to tell him to \"get over it\" which benefits you, rather than helping him work through it, which he does by vocalizing how hurt he was and setting those boundaries asking you to stop continuing those actions and making him relive that trauma in your current relationship.\n\n\"It's hard to hear the constant complaints\", get over yourself.
