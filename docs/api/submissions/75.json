Admittedly it was not easy due to two \u201cbig ticket\u201d purchases I had made in the past. In 2018 I purchased a used car for myself, it had 70,000 KMs on it and cost me 9K. This was my main commuter car for a while. In 2020 I decided to purchase myself a Honda NC750X motorcycle off the showroom floor.  To get around the issues of storage/neglect I left my car with my father and had my motorcycle shipped to me.  I chose to have my bike here because it was cheaper and easier to bring down here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter spending 10 months down here I was pulled aside this past month and offered a full-time position. The offer included a salary increase and more benefits. I was very torn however after thinking things through and speaking with my parents I decided to accept the offer. To make this happen I had to tie up any loose ends I had up north.  This meant telling my brother(25M) and friend Alex(24M) that I will not be returning to our apartment and am taking my name off the lease in December.  Almost immediately the two of them demanded that I continue to pay rent as otherwise they could not afford their University tuition/book costs.  When I told them no they went to both my mother and Alex\u2019s to complain about their finances. This whipped them into a frenzy in which I got numerous calls/messages from them demanding I \u201chelp them out\u201d.  My father did his best to help me out but in the end, he said to just ignore them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings escalated further when I decided to sell my car as it wasn\u2019t worth the effort of having it down here. To do this I had my father represent me and handle anyone who wanted to see or test drive it. Two weeks ago my brother and Alex came across my posting on Facebook marketplace and started demanding ownership of it. In response, I said they could have it if they bought it from me for 7,500 dollars. They refused and  started complaining about how much they \"need\" it for work and school.  This past week I wound up finding a buyer and closing the deal in which on Wednesday he and my father will go to the motor vehicle office to do the handover. Since marking the car as sold I have been flooded with angry calls and emails from my brother, Alex and our mothers calling me an asshole and demanding the money I made.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1667237328, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiiixe/aita_for_moving_out_and_not_giving_away_my_car_or/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You gave them more than enough notice and they\u2019re lucky you\u2019ve been paying rent in your absence. They need to find another roommate and if your mom is so mad she can move in to cover the rest. Sheesh!", "From everything I'm reading, you are NTA.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you are still paying your portion of the rent because you are still on the lease.  So if that is true, you have met your obligations.  The car is/was yours to do with what you please.  You sold it, you get the money from it.  They need to grow up and either find another roommate to take over your share of the rent when it is time to renew the lease or find another place to live that they can afford without you.  You offered for them to buy the car, they didn't want to.  You and your Dad are right here and everyone else is wrong.  Good luck with the new job!", "NTA.\n\nSucks they have to deal with losing you, and thus your part of the rent, but that\u2019s life. You gave notice with reasonable time. They aren\u2019t kids, and more, they aren\u2019t your kids. You are not responsible for their finances.\n\nAnd then the demand for your car, and later the proceeds from its sale. Your mothers, who are obviously AHs, are raising your brother and friend as entitled brats, who are also both AHs.\n\nListen to your Dad. Just ignore them.", "NTA, they need to find another tenant just like anyone else does when one party moves out. If they invest as much energy into it as they are in hassling you, they\u2019ll find someone in no time.", "NTA you owe them nothing, you gave enough notice that you were leaving and they're not entitled to anything else. If they can't afford the place they either need to move out or find a new housemate. I'd make sure you talk to the landlord yourself and not rely on them. Last thing you want is to stop paying rent but your name still on lease so you become responsible for any damages after you already left.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy don't you block their numbers (except your dad) for a while?", "Nta your dad's right you should just ignore them", "Lol, are Alex and your brother a single unit? Why does Alex get to demand your car and rent payments from you? I mean, even your brother doesn't get to demand these things, much less some friend of your brother. Then, to top it off, your brother's friend's MOTHER gets in on the act. What a bunch of entitled beggars.", "NTA, but I qualify this on one thing; if you are on the lease, you do need to pay until that lease ends. Beyond that, you don\u2019t owe them anything.", "NTA\n\nWhy are these assholes so demanding on your money? Yes they have bills but so do you. Why do they feel entitled to your money and why is your mom agreeing with this?!", "Not the Asshole. They just want to mooch off of u and are quite entitled. Tell ur mom that, if they wanted the car, they could have bought it off u since u have spent actual money while buying the car and hence u would want atleast some amount come to u.", "I didnt even read your post\n\nNTA.", "NTA NTA NTA\n\nSWEETIE, YOU NEED TO GO ABSOLUTELY NC WITH THEM LITTEL BUTTMUFFINS. they're worse than a buttmuffin, but trying to be nice here.\n\nIt's one thing to ASK for something like your car and give valid reasons as to why they'd need it. But to outright demand and flood you with BS, and make you feel like poopoo is a no-go! And when you said no, it should have been left at that.\n\nTHIS IS SOME WORLD CLASS ENTITLEMENT FROM... WHO'S ALEX? WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT BROTHER'S GF IS LIKE \"GET THAT FROM YOUR BROTHER\" AND HE'S LIKE \"GOT IT BABE\" \n\nNOT COOL\n\nNTA", "YTA - you don't owe them the car but you signed a lease presumably - you don't seem to be denying that you signed a lease. The fact that you aren't using the place is not a reason not to keep paying rent. A lease is a legally binding contract - they could take you to court and win. Either find someone to sublet who your roommates can stand or pay your portion of the rent for the remainder of the lease. This is in your best interest too because any damage caused to the apartment or a broken lease would also be your responsibility to remedy- and it'll be super annoying to deal with when you don't live in the area.", "INFO: was this place you all rented on a month-to-month lease? Or did you leave them with footing your share of the bill for the remainder of the lease terms?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They\u2019ve been bitten by the entitlement bug! Stay firm. This is a time for you to celebrate a new chapter, not be hounded by the entitled and childish. Time for them to grow up and pay their own way.", "NTA.  If they are in uni, there should be plenty of potential roommates for them, and they are not entitled to your car or the money from its sale.

Now it's their problem, and you can't always add a new person mid-lease.", "When you say they got this past month's and November's, do you mean you gave them your share of what you would've ben paying?\n\nBasically I'm just wondering if you left them paying your portion of rent for the remainder of the lease? Usually when you sign a lease, it's under the assumption you will all be there paying your portions. So everyone knows they portion each month is X amount of dollars.", "Removing one person from the lease isn\u2019t hard at all.

They can get another roommate in."]}
