I THINK your parents are the assholes for forcing you to have a party that you didn't want in the first place, for ignoring your wishes and preferences, for calling you selfish and ungrateful, for inviting people that you don't know or like, for turning your party into their party. They are not being supportive, understanding, or respectful. They are not acting like good parents. They are acting like entitled and rude guests.", "NTA.\n\nThis is not your party, this is about your parents and what they want. They're being ridiculous.\n\nAre they still giving you the gift or did they decide to give you (themselves) a party instead?", "NTA- a debut? Gross. It\u2019s obvious they don\u2019t really think this party is about your birthday, they just want to throw a party for their friends. Them guilting you about them paying for it is also laughable, since you didn\u2019t even want the party in the first place. \n\nCan you have a separate gathering with just your friends a different time? If I were you I\u2019d just make sure you get your nice gift and let your parents throw \u201cyour party\u201d to appease them. Maybe get a nice outfit out of it and then just hang out in a different room if you can, or just stay around the people you want to to keep the peace", "NTA, but don\u2019t be mistaken. This is not a birthday party. It is a debut and as such, it\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about showing you off to society.", "NTA. If your parents want to have a party and invite all of their friends tell them to have their own separate party. Why does it have to be for your 18th birthday? That's just creepy", "NTA. This isn\u2019t about you; it\u2019s about maintaining a certain social standing that you\u2019re not interested in. What they are really saying is that you\u2019re selfish for not wanting to sacrifice your birthday party and a birthday present on the altar of their image in their community. Which is bullshit. Your birthday should be about *you*, not them.", "NTA, if the party is for you then you should have input and it NOT be all about the parents.", "NTA. (still not getting your way.)\n\nIt\u2019s your party, but you\u2019re not paying for it. \n\nYou have limited say in who gets invited. \n\nYou have legitimate concerns but again you\u2019re not paying for it. \n\nShould have gone with the gift.", "NTA. The gift would have honestly sufficed. If they wanted to just go drinking and party with their friends, they could have just gone out and not use you as a reason.", "NTA. This party should be for you, not because of you. Even if they're paying, it all goes to waste when they force the guest of honor (you) to be miserable because they want to do what they want instead of making the party about the guest of honor.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, OP, I would be petty as hell and disappear entirely just before the party begins and go celebrate with my friends. If they were to berate me, I'd tell them, in no minced words, that they were making me feel like shit for a party meant to be for and about me and I decided to celebrate my birthday my way.\n\nThat said, I hope you end up having a wonderful birthday.", "NTA.
