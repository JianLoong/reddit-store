In terms of moving was he asking you to move out of the pool? In that case, NTA. If he was just asking you to move from a specific part of the pool and you didn't for \"the principle\", that's borderline AH. Expecting him to get into the pool to take a sunset is also kind of an AH comment, because it's effort and inconvenience. Him expecting you to get out of the pool just for his video would be AH behaviour on his part though.", "Nta. You had every right to enjoy the sunset there.", "NTA. HE got what he deserved. He was acting entitled to a stranger which is evil.", "These people really piss me off. There's a really beautiful little lake in the mountains not far from my house where I go fishing fairly often in the summer. I've been going there since I was a little kid and there were never issues until more recently. In the past few years, I've had multiple people ask me if I could stop fishing and move all my stuff away from the lake so that they can quickly get a picture without anyone in it. I do understand that I'm in the most picturesque spot, but I'm only there because it's also the best spot to catch fish. \n\nI always refuse since I was there first and there are also plenty of places where they can stand and still get a beautiful picture without me in it, and of course some of them get all huffy when I say I won't move. Even had a guy and his girlfriend start casually throwing rocks into the water near my line to scare away the fish in hopes that I'd just give up and leave. They were really lucky I'm not violent because a lot of people where I live would fight you over that kind of thing. \n\nIf you want a picture without someone else in it, you come super early or you fucking wait until whoever is there leaves. Like, I'm eventually going to have to pee and then you can get your instagram shot when I get up.", "Ah yeah you found better words to phrase it", "Asking someone to move for two minutes so they can take a video isn't tacky or \"demanding.\" I don't understand some of the takes here, jfc.", "I can try to explain what I meant with annoyed attitude. Formally he was not rude and used polite words but he did not sound like he is asking me for a favor but he sounded more like he has the right to take pictures of an empty pool and that I am in his way and should move. \n\nMight not male sense to everyone but thats how I interpreted it. Another commentor here summarized it very well. Some people think the whole world is ther instagram feed now and that they are entitled to have it for themselves.", "Couldn't agree more. Dude sounds like he sucks too though so I'm going ESH.", "He wanted to take a video though and I should move for several minutes. The pool was completely empty so that felt a bit ridiculous to me. Just because he does not want to get wet doesnt mean he can tell people where to be.", "I cant really answer this. I guess he did not want me kn the picture and hey was quite a couple meters behind me. So just walking a few steps would probably not be enough to be out of his picture.\n\nBut idk if that is so super important though. I was chilling there, thinking about stuff, relaxing. He is pulling me out of that moment so it does not matter of I have to move 3m or 10m.", "Beautiful sunsets usually only last a couple of minutes, so why does he have to move and not enjoy the sunset?", "We'll have to agree to disagree. By the way, he did not ask politely according to OP. She then said no, and he yelled at her. How is that \"asking\" ?", "[deleted]", "So you were just being spiteful. YTA.", "Absolutely fair point", "You said he asked you to move for two minutes.  \n\n> Just because he does not want to get wet doesnt mean he can tell people where to be.\n\nNo one is saying he can. It just doesn't make you not an AH for not being kind when you could have been. It costs nothing to just be nice to people.", "The fact that you\u2019re backtracking on how long it would have taken here calls the rest of the details into question.\n\nI doubt he was yelling or being rude, you were just deliberately spoiling his opportunity to get that shot because you could (I was here first).\n\nYTA", "Thats the point. I did not feel entitled to anything. The pool is there for everyone so he is free there to do whatever he wants. Swim, sit, take pictures, I dont care.", "*\"since you felt you were entitled to have it to yourself.\"*\n\nNowhere is this said or implied by OP - they didn't ask the guy to leave or not take any photos / videos with them in it.\n\n*\"He asked you to move only for 2 minutes\"*\n\nThe two minutes that the sun was setting, which OP was there enjoying.  They had every right to decline the request and stay where they were.", "Don't listen to them - you did nothing wrong.", "You sound like you just enjoy being a spiteful brat, honestly.
