In terms of moving was he asking you to move out of the pool? In that case, NTA. If he was just asking you to move from a specific part of the pool and you didn't for \"the principle\", that's borderline AH. Expecting him to get into the pool to take a sunset is also kind of an AH comment, because it's effort and inconvenience. Him expecting you to get out of the pool just for his video would be AH behaviour on his part though.", "Nta. You had every right to enjoy the sunset there.", "NTA. HE got what he deserved. He was acting entitled to a stranger which is evil.", "These people really piss me off. There's a really beautiful little lake in the mountains not far from my house where I go fishing fairly often in the summer. I've been going there since I was a little kid and there were never issues until more recently. In the past few years, I've had multiple people ask me if I could stop fishing and move all my stuff away from the lake so that they can quickly get a picture without anyone in it. I do understand that I'm in the most picturesque spot, but I'm only there because it's also the best spot to catch fish. \n\nI always refuse since I was there first and there are also plenty of places where they can stand and still get a beautiful picture without me in it, and of course some of them get all huffy when I say I won't move. Even had a guy and his girlfriend start casually throwing rocks into the water near my line to scare away the fish in hopes that I'd just give up and leave. They were really lucky I'm not violent because a lot of people where I live would fight you over that kind of thing. \n\nIf you want a picture without someone else in it, you come super early or you fucking wait until whoever is there leaves. Like, I'm eventually going to have to pee and then you can get your instagram shot when I get up.", "Ah yeah you found better words to phrase it", "Asking someone to move for two minutes so they can take a video isn't tacky or \"demanding.\" I don't understand some of the takes here, jfc.", "I can try to explain what I meant with annoyed attitude. Formally he was not rude and used polite words but he did not sound like he is asking me for a favor but he sounded more like he has the right to take pictures of an empty pool and that I am in his way and should move. \n\nMight not male sense to everyone but thats how I interpreted it. Another commentor here summarized it very well. Some people think the whole world is ther instagram feed now and that they are entitled to have it for themselves.", "Couldn't agree more. Dude sounds like he sucks too though so I'm going ESH.", "He wanted to take a video though and I should move for several minutes. The pool was completely empty so that felt a bit ridiculous to me. Just because he does not want to get wet doesnt mean he can tell people where to be.", "I cant really answer this. I guess he did not want me kn the picture and hey was quite a couple meters behind me. So just walking a few steps would probably not be enough to be out of his picture.\n\nBut idk if that is so super important though. I was chilling there, thinking about stuff, relaxing. He is pulling me out of that moment so it does not matter of I have to move 3m or 10m.", "Beautiful sunsets usually only last a couple of minutes, so why does he have to move and not enjoy the sunset?", "We'll have to agree to disagree. By the way, he did not ask politely according to OP. She then said no, and he yelled at her. How is that \"asking\" ?", "[deleted]", "So you were just being spiteful. YTA.", "Absolutely fair point", "You said he asked you to move for two minutes.  \n\n> Just because he does not want to get wet doesnt mean he can tell people where to be.\n\nNo one is saying he can. It just doesn't make you not an AH for not being kind when you could have been. It costs nothing to just be nice to people.", "The fact that you\u2019re backtracking on how long it would have taken here calls the rest of the details into question.\n\nI doubt he was yelling or being rude, you were just deliberately spoiling his opportunity to get that shot because you could (I was here first).\n\nYTA", "Thats the point.

The answer is \u201cNot much.\u201d\n\nThe other question is, \u201cWhat would it have cost OP to move when asked?\u201d Again, the answer is, \u201cNot much.\u201d\n\nWhat did the guy gain by asking the question? \u201cNot much.\u201d\n\nWhat did OP gain by refusing the request? \u201cNot much.\u201d\n\nSo, the interaction, and this whole discussion, are a whole lot of internalized effort for\u2026\u201dNot much\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t see any A\u2019s here, but I do see a couple of people who may want to rethink opportunities for engagement and personal growth.", "YTA\n\nDude wanted a video of the sunset. You could've easily moved for 2 minutes so he could. And the way you worded it he wasn't yelling or anything. \nHe can get in the water? You could easily move.\n\nYou felt a little bullied by someone asking you to move for 2 minutes? How does that equate to bullying? Could've moved for 2 minutes and went back to the spot you were at. I mean if someone asked you to move out of a picture they didn't want you in you hopefully would or if you asked someone to move out of the shot they hopefully would.\n\nIt's not tit for tat, just move next time for 2 minutes then resume your spot.", "NTA it's a swimming pool only one of you were swimming..", "I think I would\u2019ve started off with the snarky comments about him not being very nice and if he could find it within himself to ask you politely, you would move.

Enjoy it. e", "NTA. Good for you", "In a lot of states (I\u2019m assuming US sorry) it\u2019s illegal to mess with someone who\u2019s fishing or hunting, if something like that happens you could take it up with law enforcement if you so desire. I\u2019ve had people do crap like that while I\u2019m fishing and it really ticks me off.", "NTA He cannot expect to get his way in a public use area.

Likely his definition of 2 minutes is the same as a kid playing a video game.\n\nAlso since he's taking a video, then he'll probably want to film the sunset end, 2 minutes or longer. I fully agree with your point if not the length of time.", "Sounds like some one demanded op move rather than ask politely in which case I see where op is coming from", "ESH. Him for how he talked to you. You for\u2026 you were the only in the pool and you couldn\u2019t move a bit and still have a comparable view so he could get a video? Yeah, you were there first.

Why does it always have to be about who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong and who\u2019s inconveniencing who. You say this guy was sounding rude and loud? You didn\u2019t elaborate at all about how he was so rude. Some people just sound that way, accents and age can make you sound like that. I don\u2019t understand why some people just have to force the technical rule that yes obviously it\u2019s a public pool, but damn still be nice and courteous to the people around you.
