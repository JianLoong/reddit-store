There\u2019s no fence or divider or anything between our two sides of the backyard, so we just generally try to be respectful and stay in the area behind our own side of the duplex. \n\nSo I have a grill on my side of the backyard and had friends over for a barbeque, and some people were also smoking weed (legal where we live). My neighbor came outside at one point and complained that our smoke was blowing into her windows, and she said that if we couldn\u2019t keep the smoke from coming into her side of the duplex then we had to stop smoking because it was technically illegal (because we\u2019re not allowed to smoke inside the units).\n\nI said that I couldn\u2019t really do anything about the wind direction and asked her if she could just close her windows for a little while and then we\u2019d go back inside when we were done grilling. She said that it wasn\u2019t her responsibility because it was my smoke infringing on her space and not the other way around, and said that she\u2019d hate to have to call the police but she absolutely would if I didn\u2019t knock it off, and then she went back inside.\n\nMy friends and I started debating about whether we\u2019d actually be in trouble with the cops or if my neighbor was just full of shit. I was almost 100% sure that she was full of shit but I wanted to have a definitive answer, so I called the non-emergency line and asked if it was illegal for me to be smoking marijuana in my backyard if the smoke was going into my neighbor\u2019s windows. They asked me some questions about if we were landlord/tenant to each other, and then after I explained about it being a duplex they told me that I wasn\u2019t doing anything illegal. I told them that my neighbor said she might call them over this and they said they wouldn\u2019t dispatch officers for something like that and to not worry and enjoy my weekend.\n\nA bit after that my neighbor came back outside and told me and my friends that we were immature and scummy for preemptively calling the cops to misrepresent the situation when we knew we were in the wrong, because apparently she called the cops to complain about us and they told her that her neighbor had already called and warned them about a potential nuisance call that didn\u2019t merit police intervention.\n\nSo at first I was happy to be right, but now I\u2019m wondering if I should\u2019ve just let my neighbor call and embarrass herself without me getting involved. Because I thought from the beginning that obviously the police would just tell her to stop wasting their time and I didn\u2019t really need to escalate the situation, which I think me calling the cops too definitely did.
