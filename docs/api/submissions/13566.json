There\u2019s no fence or divider or anything between our two sides of the backyard, so we just generally try to be respectful and stay in the area behind our own side of the duplex. \n\nSo I have a grill on my side of the backyard and had friends over for a barbeque, and some people were also smoking weed (legal where we live). My neighbor came outside at one point and complained that our smoke was blowing into her windows, and she said that if we couldn\u2019t keep the smoke from coming into her side of the duplex then we had to stop smoking because it was technically illegal (because we\u2019re not allowed to smoke inside the units).\n\nI said that I couldn\u2019t really do anything about the wind direction and asked her if she could just close her windows for a little while and then we\u2019d go back inside when we were done grilling. She said that it wasn\u2019t her responsibility because it was my smoke infringing on her space and not the other way around, and said that she\u2019d hate to have to call the police but she absolutely would if I didn\u2019t knock it off, and then she went back inside.\n\nMy friends and I started debating about whether we\u2019d actually be in trouble with the cops or if my neighbor was just full of shit. I was almost 100% sure that she was full of shit but I wanted to have a definitive answer, so I called the non-emergency line and asked if it was illegal for me to be smoking marijuana in my backyard if the smoke was going into my neighbor\u2019s windows. They asked me some questions about if we were landlord/tenant to each other, and then after I explained about it being a duplex they told me that I wasn\u2019t doing anything illegal. I told them that my neighbor said she might call them over this and they said they wouldn\u2019t dispatch officers for something like that and to not worry and enjoy my weekend.\n\nA bit after that my neighbor came back outside and told me and my friends that we were immature and scummy for preemptively calling the cops to misrepresent the situation when we knew we were in the wrong, because apparently she called the cops to complain about us and they told her that her neighbor had already called and warned them about a potential nuisance call that didn\u2019t merit police intervention.\n\nSo at first I was happy to be right, but now I\u2019m wondering if I should\u2019ve just let my neighbor call and embarrass herself without me getting involved.

That\u2019s very few places.\n\nMy neighbor smokes cigarettes on our shared porch (apartments). Do I like it? No, but they have a right to it and it only smells for a few minutes. If it\u2019s seeping in, I close the bathroom window. If I were to ask them to take it somewhere else that\u2019s the same as asking them to stop smoking entirely, bc no matter where they go (parking lot, backyard, street, etc) there will be *someone* smelling it for a few minutes. \n\nLike the other person said, smoke in general is dangerous. Should people not be able to barbecue or have a bon fire on their property because it might bother others? What about burning incense or candles?", "The health hazard of weed smoke is that it is smoke. Anything other than clean air is dangerous to your respiratory health.\n\nI think the BBQ also present in this scenario is a great test comparison: it also has a strong odor and produces smoke. More smoke than weed does. And it\u2019s not just plant matter burning!\n\nShould people not legally grill on their property because the smell might bother their neighbors?", "This is the answer. You're an asshole if you disturb your neighbors constantly (even if what you're doing is legal), they're an asshole if they expect you to exist without ever creating sounds or odors. \n\nI'm leaning towards NTA here based on the following info:\n\n\\-The neighbor didn't shut the windows and she called the police over something obviously not illegal. This suggests an intrusive neighbor rather than someone seriously concerned about the smoke.\n\n\\-The neighbor did not raise any special health concerns regarding weed smoke\n\n\\-I'm assuming this is an occasional thing, not a daily problem", "I mean in the case of the BBQ it actually IS a little different depending on the specific grill because at least the ones I have grilled on would be very difficult to move while hot. There may also be concerns about grilling on grass vs concrete which may limit where you can reasonably put a grill. Someone smoking a joint generally can move without issue (or if they can't move somewhere else, the reasons usually don't have to do with them smoking).", "You can smoke outdoors, just don't smoke where it is wafting into other people's homes. I've walked through a \"haze\" outdoors many a time w/o an issue, but I don't want the inside of my house to smell like weed or cigarettes and it is only polite to move if your smoke is wafting into someone else's house.\n\nWeed smell is really strong and hangs in fabrics. I don't think pot smokers really get how strong the smell is.", "I try to be as considerate as I can when smoking. I always ask if the smell bothers people and if it does for any reason I try to stay a bit away and downwind. My grandmother just hates the smell of cigarettes and weed (which I smoke both) so she keeps febreeze at the door which I use every time I come in.\n\nI don\u2019t mind doing that stuff because my habits aren\u2019t other peoples problems to deal with.", "I agree so much. I\u2019d love to not care if my neighbors smoke but it\u2019s a major migraine trigger for me and can completely destroy my day. Technically you have the right in your yard, but you\u2019re a far better neighbor if you try to keep things pleasant.", "Perfume gives me asthma attacks too and so does BO and unshowered people. I\u2019ve still gotta encounter all those.", "I\u2019m not the poster above but I hate it because it\u2019s a health hazard for me. The smell is terrible and makes me ill (migraine trigger). I live in an area where it was legalized fairly recently and it\u2019s everywhere and people are really rude about it. I can\u2019t completely avoid exposure. If I could, I wouldn\u2019t care. But it\u2019s had a negative impact on me, like I\u2019ve missed a day of work because a neighbor smoked overnight and I had my balcony door open and didn\u2019t wake to shut it, woke up with a severe headache and puked a few times.", "[deleted]", "But they couldn't exactly move anywhere else", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

She has to be in closed room until you and your friends decide that you want to go inside? A compromise would be like ask her if you two can agree in a time that works for both of you. Honestly I hate the smell of weed, makes me really nauseous, not everyone can stand the smell as you and your friends do. You wouldn't want her to put her trash so close to your door or window, because it smells bad right? Its the same principle", "Why didn\u2019t you go to the other side of the house or closer to the street?", "I took \"smoke\" to cover all of the above, and referenced BBQ smoke simply because I've actually encountered complaints about it years ago as a property manager. Our general response: if it isn't during \"quiet hours\" close your windows.", "I do agree with that. If you have the option do it where it will least inconvenience others. OP has said they could have gone to the other side of the property, and I think that they should\u2019ve done that. \n\nI just feel like that\u2019s a consequence of having neighbors. My neighbor smokes ciggs on our shared porch and I don\u2019t like the smell, but I won\u2019t ask him not too bc where else would they go? No where near here is it possible to find a place where *someone* won\u2019t smell it. I feel like it\u2019s the same as hearing noise through the wall. Annoying, may disrupt sleep, but a consequence of close living.", "Depends who you're talking to. I'd argue most vegans prefer pot smoke to grilled meat smoke", "It could be affecting her physical well-being tho, we don\u2019t know that.\n\nMy neighbours aren\u2019t allowed to smoke on their balcony, a building rule, it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s lease. I get migraines from the smell of weed. It comes on strong and intense. One time I was walking down the street, turned a corner and someone was smoking weed and I had just been inhaling to say something to my friend and ended up puking in the church bushes (happened to be walking past an old church in the downtown core, we weren\u2019t at the church, there\u2019s lots of old churches in the city). When my neighbours do smoke on their balconies it can cause me days of pain. Idk if you\u2019ve ever had a migraine that lasted from Easter to Canada Day but I do not recommend. \n\nAnyways, she was an ass for threatening cops but like it\u2019s not out of line to ask them to move down wind", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "There's not really an other side of the house to go to because we're on the corner, there's like an embankment with gravel and then the street.", "Well and its one thing if the neighbor comes to smoke in the back while you're out with say your kids nearby. I don't think its not friendly to say \"hey, could you smoke on the other side of the house\"?\n\nIf its said politely it should be common courtesy", "You\u2019d argue correctly as a vegan who prefers pot smoke to grilled meat smoke. And there\u2019s actually studies showing 2nd-hand weed smoke is less harmful to your health than the smoke from cooking meat. And still I\u2019d never expect neighbors to move their grill even though the smell makes me completely nauseous.", "Your first problem is that you're living in an apartment.

I think, in general,  most people are pretty used to BBQ.\n\nThis is a question of, \"can I,\" vs \"should I.\"\n\nYes,  the OP is certainly within their right to smoke in their back yard, but being a good neighbor,  and moving to an area where it would be less bothersome to the neighbors would have been the nice thing to do and would have avoided the whole situation and not made enemies of someone you have to share a yard with.", "It\u2019s ok you\u2019re just a shadow at night.", "Sure do!
