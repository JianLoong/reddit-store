I study in a highschool where anything outside of studying is rare. Our EP is like the worst principal you have ever met. Even parents, teachers and vice-principal also dislike her. We finally got a event in 2 decades and like it is a science fair x 100. You got some subjects to choose and we have to make a project (team) and show it to the people who has the time to visit our school on Saturday. \n\n*Situation*: GT1 asked me to call GT2 which is in the floor under ours (computer lab). Me and F were going to call her but then EP asked us to where we were going, I answered straight \"we are going to call GT2 which is in probably in the computer lab\" and minded our business. \n\nWe went to the 2nd floor but the computer lab was closed, we thought that the GT2 can be in a neighbouring classroom so we went to find her but she wasn't there. We were returning but EP came suddenly behind us and said \"go to my office\". We were of course confused but thought that she assumed we were roaming, so we tried explaining to her but she wasn't even listening \"I ORDERED YOU TO GO IN MY OFFICE AND I DON'T WANNA LISTEN TO YOUR EXCUSES\".\n\n\nI tried explaining but she didn't give a shot and she sat us down on the floor that is at the back of her office. We again tried to explain but she threatened us with suspension so we became quite. I was almost having a panic effect as I haven't experienced it but controlled it. \n\n5 minutes later\n\nSS came downstairs to the 1st floor and our EP told \"they were roaming (we weren't)\". SS know that it cant be the case but they agreed to EP. We tried explaining but SS told \"dont say anything infront of EP\".\n\nEP said \"Your punishment ours:\n\n1. You can't participate in the event.\n2. Your exam assignments will be worth 0% (it is worth 20%) \n3. Tomorrow, our class teacher will know and we will be humiliated infront of our whole class\"\n\nWe were ofc sad but we stay quiet.\n\n2 minutes later\n\nThen, GT2 appears and I told her that GT1 wants you in the class, she said the school is ending so she won't be going there.\" Then she asked why are we sitting here. Whole story later, she laughs and said that she will talk to the EP later and wave off our punishments. \n\nWe sat on the floor calm as GT2 said that we will be safe. Then, some girls who IS FUCKING IN MY TEAM roams and ask why tf we are here. We explain the whole story and she laughs and goes off (they were roaming).\n\nFinally, the school ends and we went off, telling whoever we can tell about wtf happened today. \n\nI don't think I am the asshole but what's the reddit POV is?\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667227865, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yieagn/aita_for_following_my_teacher_orders/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
