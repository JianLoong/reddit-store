And for reasons I should not have to explain, you kids\u2019 birthdays are more hard wired than most anyway.\n\nMy gosh, she is making a huge effort and you are a marinara flag of an AH for intentionally sabotaging her.\n\nFrankly, you WANT to be pissy about this. You WANT to be all angry and hurt. This is not a her problem, this is a YOU problem.\n\nYTA.", "Same. I know I struggle with memory and planning. So I set notifications etc etc.\n\nBeing able, and I mean able, to do that without using reminders isn't a testament to how much anyone cares.\n\nI do think that knowing your weaknesses and setting yourself up for success (ie. your partner getting the attention and love they deserve) is a testament to the fact you care enough to make sure they're not disappointed or forgotten.", "That\u2019s very smart. And thoughtful.", "That\u2019s why those reminders exist!", "Hahhahahaha", "Pretty optimistic take that she remembers every other birthday by happenstance besides his. Add in that she forgets Father's Day routinely as well, and the picture painted isn't exactly pretty.", "Really? She\u2019s not making any effort! FB  is making the effort for her. They\u2019ve been together for 10 YEARS she should 100% know his birthday without reminders. OP is NTA, the wife definitely is", "She 100% does not have reminders set. The kids I'm not shocked she remembers. The pets I'm a little surprised she remembers more than mine. She also forgets fathers day almost every year.\n\nAnd I don't want to get mad at her. I'm just wondering if I'm the asshole for not reminding her because she's going to give me hell that the kids forgot because I didn't tell her about my birthday. I don't feel like that's my job.\n\nI don't want to get upset at her. I don't want to react at all. I'm sad she doesn't care much. But that's not a part of the rest of this equation.\n\nLotta people not reading before commenting. Whatever, verdict is verdict. But the situation doesn't change on my end because you want to translate your own summaries from imaginationland.", "Im gonna bust my Alfredo on your face", "Which she clearly hasn't made the effort to put in her own phone in years past...", "Yeah the ones that you set for yourself. Not ones that your partner sets for you. Again, be better set your own damn reminders to know it is your partners birthday.", ">She also forgets fathers day almost every year.\n\nIn her defense, father's day, mother's day, and slew of other holidays are centered around a specific day of the month (first sunday, second Thursday, etc.), rather than a date, which so much easier to forget. \n\nI almost always forget my husband's birthday is coming up ... until I look at it on the calendar. I forgot one of my good friend's birthday this year because it wasn't in my phone. Smart phones have made lives much easier ... to the point that we DON'T remember things if there isn't a notification for them. Think about it. When is the last time you memorized a phone number? Probably 10+ years ago because you don't have to anymore.\n\nIf you want your wife to remember, ask her to put it in her phone. She obviously remembered and took the time to do something when she had Facebook notifications, so it's not like she doesn't care - she probably just forgets. And feels bad when she does, but because you've not made it a big deal, thinks it doesn't bother you as much as it does. EVERYONE in my family knows how I feel about them not celebrating my birthday - so they don't forget.\n\nAlso, you really need to tell your wife how you feel when she forgets. Not offhand, but sit down and let her know that it bothers you. In this sense, you are a bit of an a-hole for not saying explicitly that it bothers you that she forgets when you explicitly told her you didn't like celebrating at the beginning of your relationship. She might be under the impression that you appreciate it when she does something for your birthday, but don't really care when she doesn't because you don't really like celebrating it.", "Oh I read it. The fact that you are literally intentionally sabotaging her and playing all these mind games, PLUS arguing with everyone that points out the various ways YTA, just confirms for me that you want to be pissy. And you want to be *sanctimonious* about your pissiness, which yeah makes you definitely TA.", "I have those myself, calm down. All I\u2019ve said was that if it weren\u2019t for those reminders I wouldn\u2019t remember.", "Lol. Saying it's head games. Saying I'm mad. I'm sabotaging her.\n\nHow did I sabotage her the previous 6 years then? I suppose I got explosive or overreactive for all 6 of them and that's why I clearly will this time. And I'm sure she willfully forgets every year because I get explosively upset and so it's easy to forget somebody getting mad at you, or guilting you incessantly, or whatever else.\n\nThe question was \"AITA for not reminding her.\" The rest is all speculative insight you gathered from *checks notes* nothing in my post or comments, and your own speculative imagination.\n\nAnd I mean, go ham. But I'm not going to be silent when you're making a whole fictional narrative."]}
