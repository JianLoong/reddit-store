I mean that sucks and all but you knew ahead of time, so a 50$ gift card seems pretty generous. It seems pretty gauche to make a dig at the venue **during your toast to the bride and groom!** Like yeah, not having food sucks but you didn\u2019t find out at the venue suddenly, she gave you a heads up. You should have made sure to pack snacks and have your meal come in time. YTA.", "YTA\n\nIt wasn\u2019t your wedding and the bride went WAY out of her way to accommodate you.\n\nThis is the kind of crap that makes people strongly dislike vegans. Stop being such a princess. The world is not required to cater to your choices.", "Can you tell us how you said the joke ? Verbatim if possible. This is so cringey I want to really lean into it. \nYTA .", "YTA. Your comment in front of everyone was super spiteful and necessary. \n\nThe day wasn\u2019t about you. It was about the bride and groom. But congrats, you managed to make it about you anyway. Or rather, about how petty you were on someone else\u2019s day.", "YTA she accommodated you in every way she could. There is no way that she could have foreseen that the delivery would go wrong, and there was absolutely no need to bring it up during your speech. \n\nBring snacks.", "YTA\n\nShe tried to accommodate you. YOU ordered food too late to eat it with the entree like everyone else (BTW she provided a vegan appetizer, which is pretty good\u2026). \n\nThen you humiliated her during your speech and made it look like she DIDN\u2019T accommodate you. \n\nYour joke was more of a passive aggressive complaint, and she took it that way. You didn\u2019t ruin her wedding, but you were weirdly rude and selfish during her wedding.", "I have to imagine you\u2019re downplaying your \u201cjoke\u201d if she\u2019s still mad months later. You had plenty of time to plan/order ahead, and even had extra appetizer. It sounds like you made it about yourself and basically complained about something out of your friend\u2019s (who actually went above and beyond for you, imo) control in front of everyone at HER wedding. YTA.", "YTA. She tried to accommodate you which she didn't need to. Then trying another option with Uber was extraordinarily nice of her, especially with everything else she has going on. Giving you $50 is way more than your food should cost and she could have just given you her blessing to order something yourself without giving you money on top of the reception catering cost. Even if it's a joke, it just comes across as ungrateful. One's wedding is a day when a decent amount of people are more anxious than normal so making a joke during your speech for her was just a bad idea. You should apologize.", "YTA.\nWhen the wedding party makes speeches, the subject is SUPPOSED to be the happy couple.

You proved that a vegan will tell you they\u2019re a vegan in the first 5 minutes of conversation. \n\nThe bride tried to accommodate you & it didn\u2019t work out.

You embarrassed the bride & she rightfully lit into you.", "YTA. \n\nThe only way it would\u2019ve been funny as a joke is if your food literally arrived during your speech. \n\nBut it actually just came across as entitled, annoyed, and ungrateful.

She accommodated you.", "YTA I would be amazed if she remained your friend after this", "YTA\n\nWhat is it with vegans being so damned entitled? Seriously! I have literally *never* met a vegan who wasn't entitled and self-centered about it and demanding special treatment and looking for any way possible to make a dig at non-vegans. \n\nAnd that is what you did. You asked for special treatment so that you, the only vegan, could be catered to. You basically wanted, like, half the wedding guests to not get their preferred dish so YOU would have your preference. \n\nAnd then, because your Uber Eats delivery didn't get there in time, you made a dig at the bride and, thus, all the meat eaters because YOU didn't get the special treatment you wanted. Your \"joke\" was nothing more than that.\n\nWhat you said: I'm super hungry by the way, because bride didn't have a vegan option.\n\nWhat they heard: Bride didn't cater to me so I'm gonna bitch about it. But this could have been avoided if more of you would give up your evil meat eating ways.", "YTA your speech wasn\u2019t the time to address your personal grievances.", "YTA\n\nJesus Christ.  Vegans already get a bad rap for making everything about them being vegan.  And you had to go and start off your wedding toast with talk about your veganism?", "YTA-it\u2019s not her fault that they didn\u2019t have vegan options, she planned on having one. When that fell through for reasons out of anyone\u2019s control, she still accommodated you best she could, even if it was ideal. The Uber not coming on time is out of her control as well. I would be annoyed if I were in this situation as well, but your comment was uncalled for", "YTA. \n\nWOW just wow. No actually just mean. \n\nShe did in fact ACCOMODATE you. You know that right?", "YTA.  She did her best to accommodate your dietary preferences and you threw it back in her face. She tried to get you a vegan entree and when that wouldn\u2019t work she gave you a fifty dollar gift card to get whatever you want. Plus the appetizer was vegan so you could eat something. My god why didn\u2019t she order your Uber eats earlier? What sort of bridezilla would do this?", "YTA. That wasn\u2019t fair. She did what she could to accommodate you and you disrespected her. It\u2019s not her fault Uber (that she paid for) didn\u2019t get there in time or that the venue wouldn\u2019t let her have her third option.

You could have easily had it delivered at the same time as the food service.", "YTA. She accommodated you; it\u2019s not her fault Uber didn\u2019t show up as quickly as you expected to. It is because of attitudes like OP\u2019s that words like \u201cvegan\u201d or \u201cvegetarian\u201d are perceived negatively. The speech was no time to be whining about being huuungry:", "YTA.  As a bridesmaid part of the gig is helping keep things smooth for the bride. You made her day about your mild discomfort and did it publicly.  Unless you have a side gig as a stand up comic I expect it didn\u2019t come across as a joke. Living up to the vegan stereotype pretty nicely.", "I have nothing against vegans, but from now on, I'm just going to save myself the trouble of reading any post containing a variation of the phrase, \"I'm a vegan,\" and just automatically say, YTA.", "YTA\n\nYou are the type of vegan that makes people hate vegans.", "\"I had a bridesmaid speech after the ceremony and started by joking about the venue not wanting vegans attending and how hungry I was. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA", "YTA \n\nWhy in world would you use a bridal speech to perch your vegan beliefs and take a venue to task on not providing for you?\n\nThe bride literally GAVE YOU MONEY TO ORDER VEGAN and you didn\u2019t order early enough and the driver was late so YOU BLAME THE BRIDE AND THE VENUE for your inability to organize this delivery ahead of time as you had the money!\n\nYou\u2019re a massive asshole!", "YTA giving you a $50 gift card for your meal was accommodating, bet you didn't mention that in your dig at her.

Hopefully no one is dumb enough to invite you anywhere ever again.", "Yta\n\nSo you embarrass the bride and groom even after they've done their best to accommodate you?\n\nYou are exactly why vegans get a bad rep", "YTA. Fucking entitled idiot.", "YTA. \n\nThe bride did make a reasonable attempt to accommodate you.

Thats what Yelp is for. Bridesmaid's toasts are to compliment and encourage the happy couple, not to trash on the venue and the food.", "YTA. She went out of her way to try to accommodate you while making sure everyone else was also provided for. She could have told you that you were SOL and to figure it out for yourself. Instead she provided you with more than enough money to get an entree for yourself. It\u2019s not her fault your food didn\u2019t arrive on time.  You took her special day, made it about yourself, and pouted about it - under the guise of it being a \u201cjoke\u201d.

If I were the bride. I wouldn\u2019t speak to you either, so now you\u2019ve lost a friendship over your princessy ways.", "YTA come on....", "YTA\nWay to be a stereotypical vegan.", "I read this as AITA for pissing on the bride at her wedding", "YTA.\n\nYou were probably hangry, but that \"joke\" wasn't funny and was not the right call. She really tried to accommodate your needs and couldn't have done anything about the uber being late.\n\nApologize profusely, try to make it up to her somehow.", "And keep in mind, the reason there were under 50 ppl is bc the bride's relative had a miscarriage. But I guess they should have come anyway so she could have had her special food.", "Yta. The wedding was about the couple but you made it about yourself.  She accommodated you so you could eat. You delivery was late so you got hangry like a child would.  You are very self-centered and need to read the room better.", "YTA and my day is sadder for having read such an obnoxious and entitled post.\n\nThe bride probably had to deal with a hundred different things on her wedding day to make sure everything went smoothly and your joke did not help one bit. She was nice enough to not only lay out the situation in beforehand to you, but also provided an alternative which tbh was quite generous of her.\n\nYou acted in a childish way and it's unbelievable that months late you still haven't grasped that you were a major AH in this situation.", "YTA", "YTA because I\u2019m pretty sure people have weddings with the wish that it will be one and done, so for you to take part of their special day to whine about your meal was an AH thing to do on that particular day. It\u2019s even worse because you incorporated your petty complaints into a speech. The other guests likely laugh-cringed.\n\nJFC.", "What an insufferable AH you are. YTA.", "YTA.  You publicly and verbally made her wedding all about you and your eating habits.   Way to be understanding and realize the world doesn't revolve around you.", "YTA for sure. Vegan is YOUR choice, not anyone else's. You can't expect everyone else to stop to accommodate your choices. The brides gesture of a 50$ buy out on your plate is pretty generous.", "OMG. I\u2019ve got secondhand mortification on me. YTA, from yet another meatless reader.", "Whoa!  Yeah, seriously - put on your big girl panties and deal with a little bit of hunger.  I actually ALWAYS have some kind of snack with me - even a 'salad dressing' container, or a small snap lock bag can hold yummy raw nuts and seeds, and that's what I carry as well as whatever I want to eat.  I understand not hauling a little '6 pack' esky with your favourite foods to a wedding (I take one everywhere, lol), but show a little grace - of all the legitimate reasons for plans to be rearranged, having family members drop out due to a miscarriage is understandable!  Personally, I wouldn't have taken the ubereats card, but if the Bride insisted, I would have preordered it, something cold and tasty, that could have been delivered prior to everyone sitting down.\n\nYTA.  shit happens.  Way to leverage it into calling the Bride a bad hostess and making the Bridesmaid's speech about .... the Hungry Vegan Bridesmaid.  wth??\n\nEdit - lol lol lol - you wanted the Bride to change what half the Guests had selected for their meals in order to ACCOMMODATE ONE PERSON.  Think about that - how does that make any kind of sense?    Waaaay to lean into the stereotype!", "YTA. Did you starve to death? I\u2019m having second hand cringe just thinking about your \u201cspeech\u201d which was selfish and screams entitled brat.  I\u2019m not at all surprised she\u2019s gone no contact with you.", "wow absolutely YTA. \n\nyou made someone's wedding day about you. \n\nif this was going to be a problem, why even show up? jfc.", "YTA. You wanted her to change half her menu to accommodate just your specific diet so it would affect literally everyone else's meal at the wedding including the bride and groom's? Your food was going to be delivered late, which happens from time to time with food deliveries and you still had some food to eat while you waited, it's not like you weren't going to get any food at all.  \n\nComplaining about the venue and letting everyone know you're a vegan (I'm never giving a vegan a mic) is in no way considered a joke. It is literally - you complaining about the venue and letting everyone know you're vegan. It's not the venue's fault your food was late.", "You just fulfilled the stereotype that a vegan will tell you they\u2019re a vegan whether you want to know or not. You told a whole wedding guest list. Well done.", "Yta", "YTA. People like you are why vegans have a bad reputation.

I think thats a stupid rule. \n\nBut thats the price you pay for choosing to have a dietary accommodation! And she did her best to accommodate you.

You didn\u2019t need to bring attention to it in your speech! \n- 4 year Vegan!", "Not only are YTA, but your incredibly rude behavior is now an indelible part of those wedding guests' memories of her special event. \"Remember how nice Friend's wedding was?\" \"Yes, it was amazing, and that bizarre vegan rant from the bridesmaid was hysterical. There's always someone who has to say something crazy during a toast!\" \n\nI guarantee you that no one remembers a word you said after you voiced complaints during a wedding toast like you were mistaking it for a Yelp review.  You owe your friend a huge, huge apology if you want to repair this relationship.", "YTA. Was this situation truly so severe that you literally had to alter your speech to bring it up? Also, it wasn't \"just a joke\" because guess what? YOU WERE THE ONLY VEGAN THERE. Nobody else gave a crap, and the fact that you had to make some quip about the venue \"not wanting vegans\" is remarkably tone deaf. It wasn't even kind of your day, nobody cared, you could have sucked it up, and with all that going you still chose to make the situation about yourself. With that said, I'm a \"look on the bright side\" kind of person, so the good news is that you'll probably never be invited to speak at any of your other friends' weddings, so you can take that time to sneak out and grab some bread or something!", "[removed]", "Yta", "YTA so entitled", "YTA bring food with you.

You used your wedding speech to be petty and 100% made it awkward.", "YTA. Not all vegans, but definitely this one", "YTA and no one cares that you\u2019re a vegan. I\u2019m so sick of people wanting other to cater to their CHOSEN food preferences. The bride shouldn\u2019t be worried about your Ubereats order being late. If you don\u2019t like the menu, pack a sandwich and eat appetizers, don\u2019t try to make the bride look like an ass though because you choose to be a picky eater.", "YTA. The bride didn\u2019t viciously not include you. She accommodated and circumstances out of her control made the food late. So you made the toast about you\u2026..good job.", "YTA, gross behaviour, the bride was incredibly accommodating and you showed yourself up to be inconsiderate and self centred.", "Yta, honestly this type of behavior is why vegans get bad reps. The. Ride went out of her way for you, 1 guest at the wedding. If it was my wedding I would have told you no and that would have been the end of it. At our wedding we has multiple vegans that I know of. Not one of them asked us to make the accommodation for then. Of course we did for people with allergies and intolerance, but a couple shouldn't have to cover the cost of your choice.", "YTA", "As a vegan, this gives me major second hand embarrassment.", "YTA. Do you try to make every.situation about yourself,?", "YTA. You suck.", "Yta. Your speech should have only been about your happiness for your friend. Bringing up the lack of a vegan option, after she went out of her way to accommodate you was pure bullsh!t.", "YTA. Well done making this about yourself. Sheesh.", "YTA. She tried to accommodate you, it's not her fault the venue's policy didn't allow for 2 options. It's her wedding. Also you could've ordered the food, a little early. Calling the bride out during the bridesmaid speech is just a ah move. Congrats on losing a friend because you couldn't keep your mouth shut.", "You were really hungry after eating appetizers, did you not eat at all before the wedding? YTA for not planning for yourself.

I\u2019m flabbergasted", "YTA. It sucks but the bride gave you a gift card. It isn\u2019t her fault the food you ordered was late. I have a shellfish allergy.

I\u2019m not vegan but I have some dietary restrictions that many events don\u2019t accommodate. I\u2019ve learned either to bring a snack that I know I can have to tide me over, or eat a meal beforehand. You had ways to prepare yourself. Besides that, airing your grievances with a passive aggressive joke during your toast was just wrong. \n\nI also think the bride is being a bit much. I understand reacting in the moment. But I\u2019m sure the joke didn\u2019t ruin the day and to ignore her friend for this long is silly. \n\nEveryone needs to grow up here.", "I completely agree. YTA. I am also a vegan and hate the rep entitled vegans give us. This always happens to me, but it\u2019s my choice to be vegan so I don\u2019t complain.
