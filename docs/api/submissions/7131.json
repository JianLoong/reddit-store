I mean that sucks and all but you knew ahead of time, so a 50$ gift card seems pretty generous. It seems pretty gauche to make a dig at the venue **during your toast to the bride and groom!** Like yeah, not having food sucks but you didn\u2019t find out at the venue suddenly, she gave you a heads up. You should have made sure to pack snacks and have your meal come in time. YTA.", "YTA\n\nIt wasn\u2019t your wedding and the bride went WAY out of her way to accommodate you.\n\nThis is the kind of crap that makes people strongly dislike vegans. Stop being such a princess. The world is not required to cater to your choices.", "Can you tell us how you said the joke ? Verbatim if possible. This is so cringey I want to really lean into it. \nYTA .", "YTA. Your comment in front of everyone was super spiteful and necessary. \n\nThe day wasn\u2019t about you. It was about the bride and groom. But congrats, you managed to make it about you anyway. Or rather, about how petty you were on someone else\u2019s day.", "YTA she accommodated you in every way she could. There is no way that she could have foreseen that the delivery would go wrong, and there was absolutely no need to bring it up during your speech. \n\nBring snacks.", "YTA\n\nShe tried to accommodate you. YOU ordered food too late to eat it with the entree like everyone else (BTW she provided a vegan appetizer, which is pretty good\u2026). \n\nThen you humiliated her during your speech and made it look like she DIDN\u2019T accommodate you. \n\nYour joke was more of a passive aggressive complaint, and she took it that way. You didn\u2019t ruin her wedding, but you were weirdly rude and selfish during her wedding.", "I have to imagine you\u2019re downplaying your \u201cjoke\u201d if she\u2019s still mad months later. You had plenty of time to plan/order ahead, and even had extra appetizer. It sounds like you made it about yourself and basically complained about something out of your friend\u2019s (who actually went above and beyond for you, imo) control in front of everyone at HER wedding. YTA.", "YTA. She tried to accommodate you which she didn't need to. Then trying another option with Uber was extraordinarily nice of her, especially with everything else she has going on. Giving you $50 is way more than your food should cost and she could have just given you her blessing to order something yourself without giving you money on top of the reception catering cost. Even if it's a joke, it just comes across as ungrateful. One's wedding is a day when a decent amount of people are more anxious than normal so making a joke during your speech for her was just a bad idea. You should apologize.", "YTA.\nWhen the wedding party makes speeches, the subject is SUPPOSED to be the happy couple.

You proved that a vegan will tell you they\u2019re a vegan in the first 5 minutes of conversation. \n\nThe bride tried to accommodate you & it didn\u2019t work out.

You embarrassed the bride & she rightfully lit into you.", "YTA. \n\nThe only way it would\u2019ve been funny as a joke is if your food literally arrived during your speech. \n\nBut it actually just came across as entitled, annoyed, and ungrateful.

She accommodated you.", "YTA I would be amazed if she remained your friend after this", "YTA\n\nWhat is it with vegans being so damned entitled? Seriously! I have literally *never* met a vegan who wasn't entitled and self-centered about it and demanding special treatment and looking for any way possible to make a dig at non-vegans. \n\nAnd that is what you did. You asked for special treatment so that you, the only vegan, could be catered to. You basically wanted, like, half the wedding guests to not get their preferred dish so YOU would have your preference. \n\nAnd then, because your Uber Eats delivery didn't get there in time, you made a dig at the bride and, thus, all the meat eaters because YOU didn't get the special treatment you wanted. Your \"joke\" was nothing more than that.\n\nWhat you said: I'm super hungry by the way, because bride didn't have a vegan option.\n\nWhat they heard: Bride didn't cater to me so I'm gonna bitch about it. But this could have been avoided if more of you would give up your evil meat eating ways.", "YTA your speech wasn\u2019t the time to address your personal grievances.", "YTA\n\nJesus Christ.  Vegans already get a bad rap for making everything about them being vegan.  And you had to go and start off your wedding toast with talk about your veganism?", "YTA-it\u2019s not her fault that they didn\u2019t have vegan options, she planned on having one. When that fell through for reasons out of anyone\u2019s control, she still accommodated you best she could, even if it was ideal. The Uber not coming on time is out of her control as well. I would be annoyed if I were in this situation as well, but your comment was uncalled for", "YTA. \n\nWOW just wow. No actually just mean. \n\nShe did in fact ACCOMODATE you. You know that right?", "YTA.  She did her best to accommodate your dietary preferences and you threw it back in her face. She tried to get you a vegan entree and when that wouldn\u2019t work she gave you a fifty dollar gift card to get whatever you want. Plus the appetizer was vegan so you could eat something. My god why didn\u2019t she order your Uber eats earlier? What sort of bridezilla would do this?", "YTA. That wasn\u2019t fair. She did what she could to accommodate you and you disrespected her. It\u2019s not her fault Uber (that she paid for) didn\u2019t get there in time or that the venue wouldn\u2019t let her have her third option.

You could have easily had it delivered at the same time as the food service.", "YTA. She accommodated you; it\u2019s not her fault Uber didn\u2019t show up as quickly as you expected to. It is because of attitudes like OP\u2019s that words like \u201cvegan\u201d or \u201cvegetarian\u201d are perceived negatively. The speech was no time to be whining about being huuungry:", "YTA.  As a bridesmaid part of the gig is helping keep things smooth for the bride. You made her day about your mild discomfort and did it publicly.  Unless you have a side gig as a stand up comic I expect it didn\u2019t come across as a joke. Living up to the vegan stereotype pretty nicely.", "I have nothing against vegans, but from now on, I'm just going to save myself the trouble of reading any post containing a variation of the phrase, \"I'm a vegan,\" and just automatically say, YTA.", "YTA\n\nYou are the type of vegan that makes people hate vegans.", "\"I had a bridesmaid speech after the ceremony and started by joking about the venue not wanting vegans attending and how hungry I was. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA", "YTA \n\nWhy in world would you use a bridal speech to perch your vegan beliefs and take a venue to task on not providing for you?\n\nThe bride literally GAVE YOU MONEY TO ORDER VEGAN and you didn\u2019t order early enough and the driver was late so YOU BLAME THE BRIDE AND THE VENUE for your inability to organize this delivery ahead of time as you had the money!\n\nYou\u2019re a massive asshole!", "YTA giving you a $50 gift card for your meal was accommodating, bet you didn't mention that in your dig at her.

Hopefully no one is dumb enough to invite you anywhere ever again.", "Yta\n\nSo you embarrass the bride and groom even after they've done their best to accommodate you?\n\nYou are exactly why vegans get a bad rep", "YTA. Fucking entitled idiot.", "YTA. \n\nThe bride did make a reasonable attempt to accommodate you.

Thats what Yelp is for. Bridesmaid's toasts are to compliment and encourage the happy couple, not to trash on the venue and the food.", "YTA. She went out of her way to try to accommodate you while making sure everyone else was also provided for. She could have told you that you were SOL and to figure it out for yourself. Instead she provided you with more than enough money to get an entree for yourself. It\u2019s not her fault your food didn\u2019t arrive on time.  You took her special day, made it about yourself, and pouted about it - under the guise of it being a \u201cjoke\u201d. You stood in front of all of the most important people in her life and basically said, \u201cyour wedding was crap because *I* wasn\u2019t personally catered to or satisfied with the food.

Take the little wins and stop making people hate veganism even more by having entitled attitudes.", "Yeah, YTA. \nThe entitlement is ridiculous and she made an alternate arrangement. It\u2019s not her fault that the Uber eats was late.", "YTA. I have never heard a good wedding speech, they are all sappy and cheesy. Jokes like that happen the day before or the day after the wedding. Weddings are 80% about the couple, that joke is about you and not part of the other 20%.", "Yeah YTA, duh. The bride more than accommodated you. You also could have brought snacks since you knew you had to wait for your Uber eats. You\u2019re a bad friend and give other vegans a bad name.", "YTA. How do you know when someone\u2019s a vegan? They tell you. I know a fed and they don\u2019t make a big deal out of it. Stop expecting to be catered to. You made a not funny joke after you tried to have her add a vegan option to menu just for you. She gave you 50 bucks for food and it arrived late. That\u2019s not her fault.", "I stopped reading after she offered you a gift card.: YTA", "Yeah YTA, duh. The bride more than accommodated you. You also could have brought snacks since you knew you had to wait for your Uber eats. You\u2019re a bad friend and give other vegans a bad name.", "YTA. You\u2019re the exact kind of vegan that makes people not like vegans/have a bad impression of vegans", "YTA starve", "NTA she sounds overly sensitive. I\u2019d bet you got some laughs too", "I think you NTA, it\u2019s embarrassing and cruel being the only one without eating for the whole day.", "I hope when you get married one of your dumbass friends has a stupid ass toast that ruins your wedding", "I agree with you.  OP knew what was up, ignored it and then had the audacity to try and call out a bride and groom at their wedding over an entree.  AN ENTREE.  Phew.  OP YTA.", "Also, why not order ahead of time and have the delivery scheduled for the start of the meal block? Fucking *Dominos* can do that and they do it well. The bride gave her $50 to get whatever she wanted and she still wants to complain.", "At my wedding I had a guest list and catering locked in weeks in advance. There was a drop out last minute so my husband wanted to bring his work friend and his girlfriend who's vegan. I explained to her and apologised that there wouldn't be an extra vegan meal due to short notice and you know what she did? Said it's fine and brought herself a small prepped meal in her purse and didn't complain once.", "100% this! ^^^ Definitely YTA OP!", "Please don\u2019t lump us all into the same category as OP. Unfortunately like with most groups of people, the loudest ones are usually assholes.", "OP did say \"pissing of\", not \"pissing off\"\n\nIts like the running of the bull...only its the pissing of the bride.  Bride runs around on the street and you try to piss on her? /s", "\"pissing on the bride\"\n\nisn't that a pornhub category??", "Did she ask for any bread?  She asked that the bride change one of her entrees for vegan just for her.  She wasn't going to starve.  Her food was late.  That's not that big of a deal.", "nah. bride had a small reception (under 50 total) and specifically wanted OP there. tried repeated ways to accommodate her dietary choices, and in return, during what should've been part of the celebration of love, got blindsided with \"a joke\" (read: passive-aggressive bullshit) in a speech to the couple.  \n\nhow was the bride any kind of an asshole here??", "are you offering to pay for four extra wedding meals?? depending on location, etc. that's starting at $100 pp ... or the bride could provide OP with more than enough time and money to arrange her own meal that night.", "read again.  OP ate extra appetizers. her entree was late bc uber driver caught traffic. how is ANY of that the bride's fault?!", "I don't have dietary restrictions and I still always bring snacks to big/long events.", "the driver got caught in traffic. and you roasted the bride in your speech?!  fuck, i wouldn't speak to you again either.", "Then why didn\u2019t you make a speech at the Uber driver\u2019s wedding instead? The bride literally went out of her way to accommodate you. YTA", "And that\u2019s the bride\u2019s fault how?", "as an adult, OP could have been responsible for their own food that day. KNOWING AHEAD OF TIME allowed them the opportunity to order dinner to be delivered and eaten with others. or, you know, pack some damn snacks?!  calling out the issue in the BRIDESMAIDS SPEECH was rude and petty. no wonder the bride hasn't contacted her.", "I just think that if they truly have a friendship (which I expect they did due to OP\u2019s role), then it\u2019s worth reconnecting. It sounds like it\u2019s been months without contact. I wouldn\u2019t throw away a friendship just because of this one thing. But I guess it\u2019s just the perspective I\u2019ve developed after a long life of having both shitty and great people in my life, having lost friendships, having friends die\u2026I just wouldn\u2019t let something like this end a friendship if it were a genuine one.", "Read again the part where she said she was starving. The bride and groom had to pay the chef to make her a meal, like the chef did for all the other guests", "COZ IT\u2019S ALL ABOUT MEEEE!!!", "I know, it's shitty for her to have mentioned it in the speech\n\nBut it also would have been really shitty to be the one person not catered to at an event like this. She's not the AH for asking to be catered to, but for going on about it in the speech.", "I know. I agree.", "MAYBE if OP can realise what an AH they indeed were, get themselves right, and make a sincere apology, ... but that's a hell of a lot to expect from someone who didn't have the forethought to pack themselves a snack.", "\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f the entitlement seeping from you is astounding.", "How else would everybody know?", "She was the one person who was given extraordinary accommodation, and it wasn't good enough for her.", "If I had a special diet, I cannot imagine asking the bride to have an entire dish catered just for me. I don\u2019t care if there are 48 people there or 500. That\u2019s just\u2026no. She\u2019s asking the bride to add more expense onto an already expensive event, and that\u2019s just crazy to me. She\u2019s not really even an AH for asking, but the bride could have said \u201cThat\u2019s not in my budget, sorry\u201d and left it at that. That wouldn\u2019t make the bride an AH either, it would just mean that OP would have to decide if being in her friend\u2019s wedding is more or less important than having a hot vegan meal available to her at all times. She could have eaten before and/or after. She could have brought snacks or, if the bride and venue are okay with it, brought her own meal. I guess providing for herself so that her friend could just concentrate on her own wedding was out of the question.", "NOT OPs wedding. why does she get catered to?? the bride did everything possible, including gifting her $50 food delivery card and providing vegan appetizers.", "I agree with this - OP absolutely has to admit that they shouldn\u2019t have made the \u201cjoke\u201d in the first place. Hopefully they will read these comments and realize the poor judgement and reach out with a genuine apology.", "I am not the OP, I wasn\u2019t there but I was a bride and I paid a bridal dinner for all my guests.", "I'm asking because in genuinely curious, why did you transition? I thought vegans were people who just didn't like eating meat in general. So if you like meat, why go through the hassle to transition? And what is your substitution for protein?", "We do this in our home a good chunk of our meals are vegetarian/plant based", "I KNOW. She's an asshole for mentioning it in the speech", "If you're hosting an event with a big meal you've got to cater to everyone. That includes allergies, intolerances, religious diets and lifestyle choices like vegetarianism and veganism. You can't just leave some people hungry. I get the sense people are being harsher on her because Reddit hates vegans\n\nLet me repeat myself again - she's an AH for mentioning it in the speech", "I'm the comment reply lodestone today", "i was a bride also, and accommodated multiple food issues for our guests. that isn't anything beyond being a decent host.  BUT there are things out of the bride's control - like the venue's catering minimums. --which was the issue-- and the bride did let OP know in advance, and pay for other food options.  where is OP's personal responsibility for their own dietary choices??", "Not vegan myself but my friends who are like meat\u2026but don\u2019t like how the meat industry treats animals and would rather not eat meat than support that. Also don\u2019t like the environmental impact that the industry has.", "You do realize that animal products aren't the only way to get protein, right? I'm a meat eater, but plenty of things like beans, quinoa, amaranth, avocados, legumes, and nuts have lots of protein.", "No, you don\u2019t have to cater to everyone. That\u2019s absurd. OP is vegan. Someone else may be gluten free. Someone else may be lactose intolerant. Someone else may be allergic to nuts. You cannot always accommodate everyone, nor should you be *expected* to. If you want to make the effort, great. But a bride is inviting someone to their ceremony and providing a meal. Guests can eat it or not.", "Bride gave her a $50 Uber eats card to have her vegan meal delivered. Is that not catering to her dietary requirements?", "I'm sure we have plenty we agree on though beyond food catering at weddings", "Epic Reddit moment vegan got owned compilation #14", "Yea it is, just that people on this thread seem to think it's alright to leave people hungry at an event like this", "I don\u2019t care that she\u2019s vegan. She could be anyone with diet restrictions and I\u2019d say the same. You\u2019ve got a chip on your shoulder and it\u2019s blinding your objectivity.", "Wouldn't it be mad shitty though to be coeliac for example and constantly have to think about what you're gonna eat/whether you can go to an event or not while simultaneously feeling guilty that you're always bothering people??? Most catering companies take this kinda thing into account so it's not an issue"]}
