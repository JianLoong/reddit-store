I mean that sucks and all but you knew ahead of time, so a 50$ gift card seems pretty generous. It seems pretty gauche to make a dig at the venue **during your toast to the bride and groom!** Like yeah, not having food sucks but you didn\u2019t find out at the venue suddenly, she gave you a heads up. You should have made sure to pack snacks and have your meal come in time. YTA.", "YTA\n\nIt wasn\u2019t your wedding and the bride went WAY out of her way to accommodate you.\n\nThis is the kind of crap that makes people strongly dislike vegans. Stop being such a princess. The world is not required to cater to your choices.", "Can you tell us how you said the joke ? Verbatim if possible. This is so cringey I want to really lean into it. \nYTA .", "YTA. Your comment in front of everyone was super spiteful and necessary. \n\nThe day wasn\u2019t about you. It was about the bride and groom. But congrats, you managed to make it about you anyway. Or rather, about how petty you were on someone else\u2019s day.", "YTA she accommodated you in every way she could. There is no way that she could have foreseen that the delivery would go wrong, and there was absolutely no need to bring it up during your speech. \n\nBring snacks.", "YTA\n\nShe tried to accommodate you. YOU ordered food too late to eat it with the entree like everyone else (BTW she provided a vegan appetizer, which is pretty good\u2026). \n\nThen you humiliated her during your speech and made it look like she DIDN\u2019T accommodate you. \n\nYour joke was more of a passive aggressive complaint, and she took it that way. You didn\u2019t ruin her wedding, but you were weirdly rude and selfish during her wedding.", "I have to imagine you\u2019re downplaying your \u201cjoke\u201d if she\u2019s still mad months later. You had plenty of time to plan/order ahead, and even had extra appetizer. It sounds like you made it about yourself and basically complained about something out of your friend\u2019s (who actually went above and beyond for you, imo) control in front of everyone at HER wedding. YTA.", "YTA. She tried to accommodate you which she didn't need to. Then trying another option with Uber was extraordinarily nice of her, especially with everything else she has going on. Giving you $50 is way more than your food should cost and she could have just given you her blessing to order something yourself without giving you money on top of the reception catering cost. Even if it's a joke, it just comes across as ungrateful. One's wedding is a day when a decent amount of people are more anxious than normal so making a joke during your speech for her was just a bad idea. You should apologize.", "YTA.\nWhen the wedding party makes speeches, the subject is SUPPOSED to be the happy couple. NOT complaints about the lack of accommodations for your singular dietary preference. Way to make it about you...Maybe \"ruined the wedding\" is exaggeration, but it was definitely tacky and self-centered.", "YTA.  You proved that a vegan will tell you they\u2019re a vegan in the first 5 minutes of conversation. \n\nThe bride tried to accommodate you & it didn\u2019t work out.

You embarrassed the bride & she rightfully lit into you.", "YTA. \n\nThe only way it would\u2019ve been funny as a joke is if your food literally arrived during your speech. \n\nBut it actually just came across as entitled, annoyed, and ungrateful. She gave you $50 to order whatever you wanted! She could have just told you to bring some almonds and suck it up. But she didn\u2019t. She accommodated you.", "YTA I would be amazed if she remained your friend after this", "YTA\n\nWhat is it with vegans being so damned entitled? Seriously! I have literally *never* met a vegan who wasn't entitled and self-centered about it and demanding special treatment and looking for any way possible to make a dig at non-vegans. \n\nAnd that is what you did. You asked for special treatment so that you, the only vegan, could be catered to. You basically wanted, like, half the wedding guests to not get their preferred dish so YOU would have your preference. \n\nAnd then, because your Uber Eats delivery didn't get there in time, you made a dig at the bride and, thus, all the meat eaters because YOU didn't get the special treatment you wanted. Your \"joke\" was nothing more than that.\n\nWhat you said: I'm super hungry by the way, because bride didn't have a vegan option.\n\nWhat they heard: Bride didn't cater to me so I'm gonna bitch about it. But this could have been avoided if more of you would give up your evil meat eating ways.", "YTA your speech wasn\u2019t the time to address your personal grievances.", "YTA\n\nJesus Christ.  Vegans already get a bad rap for making everything about them being vegan.  And you had to go and start off your wedding toast with talk about your veganism?", "YTA-it\u2019s not her fault that they didn\u2019t have vegan options, she planned on having one. When that fell through for reasons out of anyone\u2019s control, she still accommodated you best she could, even if it wasn\u2019t ideal. The Uber not coming on time is out of her control as well. I would be annoyed if I were in this situation as well, but your comment was uncalled for", "YTA. \n\nWOW just wow. No actually just mean. \n\nShe did in fact ACCOMODATE you. You know that right?", "YTA.  She did her best to accommodate your dietary preferences and you threw it back in her face. She tried to get you a vegan entree and when that wouldn\u2019t work she gave you a fifty dollar gift card to get whatever you want. Plus the appetizer was vegan so you could eat something. My god why didn\u2019t she order your Uber eats earlier? What sort of bridezilla would do this?", "YTA. That wasn\u2019t fair. She did what she could to accommodate you and you disrespected her. It\u2019s not her fault Uber (that she paid for) didn\u2019t get there in time or that the venue wouldn\u2019t let her have her third option. Thinking that everyone else should have had to be changed and that the bride should then chase everyone down for their new food options to accommodate ONE person is absurdly entitled.", "yta\n\nthat was you being petty\n\nshe was very accommodating\n\n\u00a350 uber gift card and you still moaned and  managed to tell everyone your a vegan\n\nyour a vegan we get it but its your choice\n\nyou even tried to have her pick a vegan options for half the guest really\n\nyou need to say sorry and honest sound horrid", "Info\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you just schedule Uber delivery before the ceremony? You could have easily had it delivered at the same time as the food service.", "YTA. She accommodated you; it\u2019s not her fault Uber didn\u2019t show up as quickly as you expected to. It is because of attitudes like OP\u2019s that words like \u201cvegan\u201d or \u201cvegetarian\u201d are perceived negatively. The speech was no time to be whining about being huuungry:", "YTA.  As a bridesmaid part of the gig is helping keep things smooth for the bride. You made her day about your mild discomfort and did it publicly.  Unless you have a side gig as a stand up comic I expect it didn\u2019t come across as a joke. Living up to the vegan stereotype pretty nicely.", "I have nothing against vegans, but from now on, I'm just going to save myself the trouble of reading any post containing a variation of the phrase, \"I'm a vegan,\" and just automatically say, YTA.", "YTA\n\nYou are the type of vegan that makes people hate vegans.", "\"I had a bridesmaid speech after the ceremony and started by joking about the venue not wanting vegans attending and how hungry I was. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA", "YTA \n\nWhy in world would you use a bridal speech to perch your vegan beliefs and take a venue to task on not providing for you?\n\nThe bride literally GAVE YOU MONEY TO ORDER VEGAN and you didn\u2019t order early enough and the driver was late so YOU BLAME THE BRIDE AND THE VENUE for your inability to organize this delivery ahead of time as you had the money!\n\nYou\u2019re a massive asshole!", "YTA giving you a $50 gift card for your meal was accommodating, bet you didn't mention that in your dig at her.

Hopefully no one is dumb enough to invite you anywhere ever again.", "Yta\n\nSo you embarrass the bride and groom even after they've done their best to accommodate you?\n\nYou are exactly why vegans get a bad rep", "YTA. Fucking entitled idiot.", "YTA. \n\nThe bride did make a reasonable attempt to accommodate you.

Thats what Yelp is for. Bridesmaid's toasts are to compliment and encourage the happy couple, not to trash on the venue and the food.", "YTA. She went out of her way to try to accommodate you while making sure everyone else was also provided for. She could have told you that you were SOL and to figure it out for yourself. Instead she provided you with more than enough money to get an entree for yourself. It\u2019s not her fault your food didn\u2019t arrive on time.  You took her special day, made it about yourself, and pouted about it - under the guise of it being a \u201cjoke\u201d.

The bride couldn't control when the uber eats would arrive, but you had no problem eating a bunch appetizers and I am sure there was most likely a salad there too. You should have also brought snacks with you, like most brides & bridesmaids do. Bashing her because your food was late is in poor taste and shows how childish you are.

If a guest needed a V/VE meal, we just needed to know how many, and the chef would have those ready to go to bring out with the other entrees, it wasn't considered a 3rd meal option. So I STRONGLY suspect that the bride didn't actually check with the caterer and thus brought some of the drama on herself, so for that I'll say ESH. \n\nHowever, clearly OP was also totally in the wrong over how she handled it, and I do wonder if maybe part of the reason the bride didn't handle it well herself was because of past issues with OP over her dietary restrictions.", "My mom is a vegan and she complained for weeks about my cousin's wedding not having a vegan option.

It was great because I could pre-order it and then track the delivery, or, if I didn't have the opportunity to order in advance, I'd place the order on the app while I was at my own dinner and then check the notifications. It became something of a joke with my coworkers that we'd be finishing up a dinner in NYC and they'd ask me if hubs had gotten his food yet.", "I guarantee you every person in that room thought OP was a total asshat.", "Seriously, I get cranky without food, and I know that not everywhere has food available to me, guess who keeps a backpack with me with a pouch of food\u2026. It\u2019s not that hard. I don\u2019t get op at all. Hell crackers fit in the tiniest of purses, load up on the hash browns in the morning. What a weird world.", "Now that\u2019s sad when another vegan disagrees. Definitely means OP Is TA.", "And it wasn't like it was a surprise! OP had PLENTY of time to figure out a snack or two to have with her.", "I\u2019d be grateful for a 10$ McDonald\u2019s gift card tbh. She didn\u2019t even have to do *that* for her. She could\u2019ve asked her to just eat at home or beforehand.", "Being vegan isn't a disability. They could have eaten all the things on the plate that weren't meat.", "Gotta be honest, I think the Uber gift card might be an even better option than a vegan plate from the caterers. OP could have gotten whatever she wanted, and let's be honest, lots of banquet halls/caterers aren't really motivated to provide tasty, creative vegan dishes.", "Just as a note, the reason you probably crave burgers during that time of the month is probably because your body needs iron to help make up for the blood loss, as well as other minerals that are in red meat. You might be able to look into supplements to help cover those needs.", "My former employer had a plant burger once. It hit my burger craving great. Completely vegan except how it was cooked bit it was great. Sk just search around a little bit. You might find the perfect burger. And I\u2019m not vegan or vegetarian. So it\u2019s possible to find it!", "She's the one being more picky than anyone else there about what she will and will not eat. There was food. She chose not to eat it. Veganism is a choice.", "The last time I mentioned to a vegan that I liked a vegan recipe they went so hardcore on trying to convince me to only eat vegan I had to block them on three platforms. \n\nIt's like they don't realize they're doing the opposite of what they want. She should have just been like \"oh cool I have these similar recipes you might like\" instead of sending me constant messages about the meat industry many of which weren't even true. (I buy from a local butcher, I could and have been to where the animals live.) She even tried to convince me farmers skin sheep for wool.", "For me it was a craving for rare steak when I was on my period. Now that I've newly got a hysterectomy I'm still trying to figure out how it's gonna affect me with everyone since I still have hormones as they didn't take everything completely. But my sister craves fish when she's on hers and steak and burgers and all the irony things. I'm allergic to seafood so I don't have that craving thankfully lol", "Want to share this AMAZING vegan kibbeh recipe. I make this with some tabbouleh and some hummus. Such a satisfying meal. I'm a former vegetarian that still loves meat-free options.  \n\nhttps://www.onearabvegan.com/2017/06/vegan-pumpkin-kibbeh-2-0/", "A dairy intolerant friend told me that the shredded stuff is good for adding some \"cheese flavor\" to a dish in a small amount (like some sprinkled on taco meat), but she hadn't found any that was good to eat as cheese."]}
