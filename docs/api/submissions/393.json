{"id": 393, "submission_id": "yhznkb", "title": "AITA for not wanting to share friends with my sister?", "selftext": "My sister (19F) has had a really hard time with friends since high school. I (20F) have always felt pressure from her and my parents to be that friend for her, but it\u2019s been difficult for me. I love her and want her to be happy, but I\u2019m exhausted. \n\nShe moved away for college but had difficulty with friends and in the past year she moved back and we are now at the same university. I feel horrible for wishing that she stayed. I really want her to be independent and find her own friends like I have. I just feel very strongly that this will make her so much happier than relying on me.\n\nI told her a while back that she is always welcome to hangout with me and my friends, but that it was important to me that she try to build connections with new people. She was incredibly offended by this. In the past six months, she\u2019s tried to make new friends but has repeatedly told me that there are no \u201ccool people'' outside of my friends, and that she should be able to hangout with anyone she wants if they make her happy. While she\u2019s not necessarily wrong about the latter, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s making much of an effort to get to know anyone else.\u00a0\n\nFor the past six months, she has invited herself to pretty much every get together. At first it was fine, but I slowly realized that it was becoming an expectation that she would always be included by me, and that she saw my friends as her friends. And to her, sharing friends as sisters just makes sense. To me, it feels like a boundary issue. I want my relationship with her and my friends to be separate, and it\u2019s truly not personal to her.\u00a0\n\nRecently, she asked me if she could come to something that I was hosting (she had other plans but preferred coming to mine). At this point, I was exhausted from hiding how I felt from her. I reexplained to her that I really wanted her to make her own friends because I felt that this would make her happier in the end.\n\nThe conversation ended as horribly as it could\u2019ve. She kept telling me that she was trying to make other friends but that everyone aside from my friends are \u201clame.\u201d She kept saying that I thought she was annoying and that I didn\u2019t like spending time with her because she \u201cbrings the whole mood down.\u201d None of this is true, and I never said anything close to this. She thought it was absurd that I used the term \u201cboundaries\u201d to describe my feelings, and said that I was only saying this to mask the fact that I don\u2019t like hanging out with her. Also not true.\u00a0\n\nI almost caved and said she could continue hanging out with my friends and I, because this seems to be the only thing she wants to hear and it hurts me to see her hurt. If I do this though, I\u2019m disregarding my feelings, and I\u2019m really sick of doing that. As much as I want her to be happy, I also want to be happy. AITA?\n\nEDIT: People have been asking about my friends and that\u2019s fair. Here is my response which is also in the comments:\n\n\nThey have always been very kind to her since I started including her. I hesitate to tell them too much about my feelings for my sister\u2019s sake, but it doesn\u2019t seem they are close with her. I don\u2019t want my feelings to influence theirs at all. If they want to be her friend I have no intention to stop that. My hope was that my sister would understand my feelings and work on other friendships. I didn\u2019t ask her to stop hanging out with them - I told her how I felt. I feel like it would an AH move to ask my friends what they think. I also don\u2019t think they would feel comfortable telling me that they don\u2019t like my sister at this point (without me asking). I\u2019ve only spoke to my closest friend about this (who is on my side), as for the rest of them: they think that I always want her there.", "created_utc": 1667187350, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhznkb/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_friends_with_my/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't tell her that she couldn't hang out, and you didn't try to get your friends to reject her. All you asked her to do was put more effort into meeting new people. It's not your fault that she has a shitty attitude about making new friends. You guys are probably all going to be moving out to go to school soon, so if I were you I would just kind of let this go. But it's okay to be honest with her that you wish that she would try harder to be independent from you.  It's also okay for you to not invite her to events with your friends if you want a break from her. If one of your friends wants to invite her, you should say yes and just move on.

I've seen other people do it for their siblings and friends as well. It's not a big deal if you already like spending time with that person.\n\nI'm also coming at this as an introvert with social anxiety. A sister or friend or husband introducing me to their wider circle and including me in their plans has been one of the easier ways for me to befriend people. \n\nBasically I've been on both sides of this sharing friends equation and it just makes sense to me in a \"the more, the merrier\" way. \n\nI understand other people may want to separate their relationship with their siblings from their relationship with their friends and that's completely alright.
