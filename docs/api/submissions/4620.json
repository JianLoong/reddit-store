She\u2019s a complete AH for yelling at you on your wedding day and you had every right to kick her out. Don\u2019t let your family twist things, having 3 well behaved kids who are your immediate family is a very normal and common sense exception to a child free wedding.

Yeh, you bent the \"rules\" for your kids and brother, but at end of the day it's your event. You know your cousin's kids to be disruptive, so you didn't want them to attend.  I could understand her being a bit put off, but to make a scene about it and then take it to social media is...well, indicative of someone that might raise disruptive kids *shrug*.\n\nShe said you have no right?

This wasnt about her.

Their wedding, their rules. Nobody else's experience is negatively impacted during that time. Anybody who's upset about this part is an ass. \n\nIf I'm drunk, dancing to \"shout\" at a quarter to midnight, and I trip over a 3 year old after I was assured this was a child free wedding, I might be reasonably a little salty that I had to shell out for a babysitter and the vibe is still not fully child free. That's what I wanted to clarify."]}
