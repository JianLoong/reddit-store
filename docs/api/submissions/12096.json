I'm not going to get into it, but I had a chaotic and unstable childhood. Everyone knew about it, but nobody would or could interfere. When I was 18, a close friend of mine's grandparents offered to completely pay for me to go to college under two conditions:\n\nUntil the day I graduated, I had to completely cut contact with my family and anyone that could contact them. More than that, I couldn't go any closer than a six hour drive from my hometown. In their words, that was the only way they felt I would ever be able to finish college, and that any contact with them would lead to me getting dragged back in forever. \n\nI decided that they might be right and accepted. It was hard, but I finished college, got some therapy, and decided after graduation to...not be in a rush. It's been 8 years. Last month I got contacted by a PI that my sister had hired. I decided to call her and try reconnecting. \n\nShe was relieved that I'm okay, but she demanded to know where I've been this whole time. I explained the deal I made. She was horrified and demanded to know how I could have done that and been so heartless. She explained that two years after I left, there was an emergency with our father where they desperately needed a next of kin, and of course I was nowhere to be found. It caused a lot of problems because everyone who was present was under 18 or unfit. There were apparently threats of legal action, but that fizzled out when even they couldn't figure it out. It caused so many problems and ruined everyone's lives. \n\nI felt horrible, but honestly? It kind of proved that my friend's grandparents were right. If anyone had told me about that at the time, I could NEVER have finished college. I would have been forced, likely legally, into coming home and being mom for the rest of my life. She wanted an apology, and I couldn't give one. Not a real one anyway. I tried to, but she knew that I couldn't budge on the idea that I did what I had to do. \n\nShe's blasting me to everyone that will listen and given out my phone number for people to call. All of my extended family and old high school friends are calling me the worst names possible. I don't know that there's anything else I could have done. I couldn't have helped without destroying my future, and I'm not convinced I'm wrong for that. I know I made a choice that seems bad, but maybe I just had to.

And obviously your friends grandparents were right.  As soon as you reconnected with your family they are already trying to drag you into drama. You really got saved from a lifetime of drama and poverty. Change your number and don't look back.", "NTA. Their reaction shows that you did the right thing. After all these years, all they want to do is be verbally abusive.", "NTA. Her reaction proves exactly why those very kind people were so worried about you staying in touch with your abusive biological family.change your phone number or block them, speak to your therapist and move on.

The ink of money is stronger than both the blood of the covenant and the water of the womb. Kinship may vanish in an instant but money only slowly loses its value over time (unless you live in an incompetently-run country).

By all means peer over the edge but don't give the other crabs an opportunity to pull you back in. The horrible feeling will pass if you try sufficiently hard to make it go away.\n\nYou say the situation with your father and needing a next of kin ruined everyone's lives, but that's untrue. It didn't ruin your life. As you observe, your family and former friends are so angry at you for escaping their clutches and setting yourself up for success in life. Don't apologize for that.", "Wow, absolutely NTA.  Your friend's grandparents are amazing, they obviously saw something in you to believe in and did something about it.  Really rare.\n\nYour sister is showing you why you made such a good decision in accepting the terms of the deal.  It sounds like it's really too bad that she found you, but it should be fairly easy to get another SIM card, text your contacts your new number and hope for the best.  \n\nIf I wanted to make it hard for a PI to find me I'd hide the number behind a LLC, but that's just me.  Good luck!", "NTA\n\nYour friend's grandparents were wise angels. You did the right thing. All this hubbub with your sister just proves it. Block them. Change your number. Stay NC. You don't owe them anything.", "NTA.\n\nFirst, get a new phone number.\n\nSecond, go buy a lovely bunch of flowers, and the biggest, yummiest box of chocolates you can find, and perhaps the nicest bottle of wine that they like too. And then go and visit your friend's grandparents, and thank them profusely. Because they saved your future and gave you a future that you otherwise would not have had.", "NTA - Disregarding everything else, it all boils down to the fact that you weren't aware of what was going on so there's literally nothing you could have done to prevent it. \n\nFull stop, period, end of discussion.", "NTA.\n\nAs you said yourself, your friend\u2019s grandparents were right. Also threats of WHAT legal action? What country are you in? Are you in a country where older siblings are required to look after younger ones? The term \u201cparentification\u201d turns up a lot on reddit and that\u2019s exactly what this is. \n\nI understand her anger, in a way, because you had a fantastic opportunity that I\u2019m assuming she didn\u2019t have. I wonder if she would have done differently, though? If you\u2019re in a position to help now and want to, do it. But in any case, tell her to stop giving out your number and info so people can call you up and blast you for having the audacity to refuse to light yourself on fire to keep them warm.\n\nOut of curiosity, I assume the grandparents of friend were aware of what was going on at your home; did they help your old family at all? Not that they were in any way required to. Just curious.", "NTA. You weren't the default parent for others to rely on.

They are toxic so go back to NC.", "NTA\n\nChange your phone number and then proceed to go no contact with the rest of your family members. Also, take your friend's grandparents out to lunch and thank them repeatedly. They saved your life.", "NTA. You got out. Congratulations \ud83c\udf89 I\u2019m sorry your sister went to the lengths of a PI to be an asshole. I\u2019m sorry she went through a hard time after you left, but you had an opportunity to make something of your life and you took it. Sometimes we have to make the least worst choice, and it seems like yours was actually really good. I\u2019m so proud of you.

I keep flip-flopping between NTA and ESH, only because letting your underage siblings think that maybe you're dead is pretty awful.\n\nYou left home at 18. That's normal. You went NC with a family that was chaotic and unstable. That is understandable. \"Disappearing\" is cruel your younger siblings. You could've at least left a note saying that you're fine, but taking off. My husband's high school friend disappeared. To this day no one knows and that's hard. You didn't owe your parents a note, but not informing your younger siblings just added to the drama they were still too young to escape.\n\nClearly, however, your sister's anger is misplaced. It's not your fault that your parents created a mess, and it was not your responsibility to clean it up. You did not have the money or resources to take care of your family. You went to school on a scholarship. You took an opportunity. She should be able to understand.\n\nI don't know what country you're in. Here in Canada, you would not have been legally forced to take care of your younger siblings. So the INFO needed is what country you are in. If you are in a country where you legit by law would've been forced to drop out of school to go and take care of your younger siblings, if someone had been able to track you down, then I will take back everything I said about disappearing and say NTA. Otherwise, ESH.", "there's no way internet strangers could possibly have enough information about this situation to judge it accurately. and anyway, you clearly made your choice, so right or wrong you have to just live with the consequences now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
