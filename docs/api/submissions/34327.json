Mostly, my job is doing intakes for kids that are arrested and ensuring the current residents are safe during the night. I work with a partner (60 f) on doing everything we need to do and we have worked together for about 7 years.\n\nCurrently, we have a resident that is approximately 17 years old. They have never been in trouble before and are in detention for a pretty minor incident but the court systems have complete control over our admits. We have 0 say as a facility. This resident is somewhere near 4-5 months pregnant and is struggling with adapting to the stressful environment (refusing food, not following rules, isolating, constant arguments with staff, morning sickness, stress from dealing with pregnancy/courts/being a teenager, etc) For context, it is my personal belief that this child should not be in detention but again, I have no say over this aspect.\n\nThis kid can be a handful but is pretty minor compared to our typical resident. They pick and choose when they want to follow rules. One thing they will do is refuse to eat food all day, because detention food isn't the greatest. Then, they will try to manipulate staff to give them additional food. Because it was the holidays, our in house nurse was on vacation and typically it would be nursing staff to set up a food plan for a child that isn't eating properly. Obviously, this type of plan was not in place for this child. .\n\nThe other night, I was doing my rounds and this resident told me they were hungry and wanted a sandwich. I know from our documentation that they didn't eat a lot during the day. I made the call to give the kid a sandwhich.\n\nMy co-worker was adamant that the kid was manipulating the situation, wasn't following program rules, and had lost privileges for behaviors earlier in the day. She felt this type of behavior should not be rewarded by letting her have food outside meal times (one of our typical program rules).\n\nThere is no hard-fast rule on if I'm allowed to give the kids food. It's widely up to my best judgment when making safety calls. I often feed new intakes at all hours of the night because often kids come to us without having a proper meal and I don't want them to go to bed hungry. \n\nMy co-worker is a stickler for rules and \"teaching kids a lesson\". These kids have all been arrested for a crime and are facing charges. Her contention was that if we don't feed her, she won't refuse food the next day. I'm not new to this job and I knew the kid was manipulating to get food, but to be completely honest I didn't care. I saw this as a medical issue and a pregnant child under a lot of stress was hungry. So I fed then.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1704384545, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ygp29/aita_for_letting_a_kid_manipulate_me_for_food/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A pregnant person's nutrition and food intake is indeed a medical issue. I don't think it would have been appropriate to hold a firm line on this.

This situation is a potential minefield.", "The pregnant kid experiences morning sickness.  This is a valid reason to not eat at the scheduled times. This is not manipulation. This is a physical condition.  Food should be available for when their body can reasonably accommodate oral intake.  NTA.  Report it to your facility medical staff so the individual can be placed on a specific nutrition plan that makes reasonable adjustments to food availability to meet their bodies needs in this special circumstance.", "NTA. The kids are already being taught a lesson - they've been arrested and are facing charges. Leaving any of them, particularly a pregnant one, to go hungry is assholery.", "NTA. Food should be available all the time to everyone, and this goes doubly for minors and triply  for pregnant minors.\n\nI've been pregnant. Sometimes you desperately 100% need to eat some weird ass thing at 3:00 in the morning, and sometimes you can't eat anything all day.", "NTA. I was a full grown adult when I was pregnant and my eating habits were all over the place. I can't imagine how difficult it is for her to be experiencing morning sickness but expected to eat on a schedule.", "NTA.  More people like you are needed in these facilities.", "This was my thought.. TBH, if there was a strict rule in place that said I shouldn't have done it, I still would have done it and then accepted the consequences for my actions. I don't believe in using food as a teaching mechanism. I refuse to use it with a pregnant child.", "She doesn't need to manipulate someone for food though. She is refusing the food that is provided because she wants to manipulate the staff.", "In my state, the legal age of consent is 16 and the father is also around 17. There is no foul play, from a legal standpoint, suspected around the pregnancy. \n\nI had to limit my response because I get wordy, and there was a character limit. The first thing I did was write an email to the supervision team about having a future plan in place. My education is in criminal justice, not medical, so I never want to be forced into that position.", "OP needs to document EVERY judgment call. Date, time, inmate, relevant facts about the situation. On 1/1, approx. 6pm, #3456 requested additional food. Reviewed records, confirmed they had not taken lunch. Nursing staff unavailable due to holiday. Provided sandwich from cafeteria. \n\n99% of the time, creating that documentation is a total waste of time and effort. The 1% where it's not, it'll save your ass and you'll be thankful you did it.", "Everything is heavily documented and all my interactions are on camera. All conversations are monitored by a co-worker in the control room and my partner is physically present for any direct interactions. I'm not too worried about this element. 99% of the time when giving out \"extra food\", it's to a new male intake at 3am who says they haven't eaten in days. But you're right, this could be an important component if we didn't have all those safety protocols in place.", "Food isn't being withheld. Food is being provided at set meal times which she is refusing to comply with.", "I didn't have room to outline all the legal components but I'm well educated on these aspects and am protecting myself (and the child to the best of my ability). I'll never put myself in a situation where my work is telling me I can't do something I think is immoral or illegal. Proper documentation and concerns were addressed with the supervision team and the probation officer in charge of the client's case. The client was also seen at the hospital that day for an unrelated incident.", "Personally, I don't care either way. Both situations end with a hungry child that shouldn't be hungry. Based on what I know of the kid, I do think a big part of it is she doesn't like the food so she refuses it. I just think we should feed her anyway and not use it as an opportunity to learn a life lesson. Apparently, I'm in the minority amongst my coworkers but it's reassuring that I'm not alone in the world, just at work.\n\nEdit: I also leave room that I could be completely wrong and her refusal has nothing to do with preference.", "Policy would dictate meals are ate at specific times and that is when kids are expected to eat. Unless medical staff direct otherwise or religious accommodations. There is no direct policy that says I can't provide additional food and supervision is aware when I do and why. I'm not receiving any disciplinary actions for providing food, my coworker is just trying to rally other staff against me and make a rule that says I can't do that anymore in the future.", "I didn't have room to explain everything but I'm not worried about the legal components of the situation (child neglect, cruel and unusual punishment, etc). I have an MA in Criminal Justice and 10 years working in the field, so I have a good foundation to navigate this.\n\nMy issue was more that my co-worker is talking trash about me (I'm a big boy, I can take it) and trying to rally my other co-workers against me and get rules changed. I'm a very left leaning person in a very conservative area. My co-worker thinks this was an issue of politics and not me doing my job appropriately. So I started to wonder if me not caring about the kid \"learning a lesson\" was really as dumb of an argument as I thought it was. My othet co workers seem to agree with her and think I was wrong. I'd do the same thing tomorrow.", "Thank you for your feedback. I should clarify when I use manipulation because I agree with you, a hungry kid trying to get something they can eat is not manipulation. \n\nI mentioned in a separate comment that the kid had been at the hospital earlier that day for an unrelated issue and the pregnancy was checked out. I am a mandatory reporter and would report any suspected abuse promptly. Had my co-worker somehow physically stopped me from providing food that I felt was medically necessary, I would have reported it through all proper channels. Addional steps were taken to make sure this isn't a continuing problem. \n\nI use manipulation because it is the belief that the child is refusing food she could eat out of personal preference and then \"using her pregnancy\" as an excuse to get better food. I made it clear to my coworker that she could have flat out told me that is what she was doing and I'd still give her the sandwich because manipulation was the least of my concerns.", "I agree and try to abide by this the best I can.. one of the many moral conflicts I have about working in our broken system.. but I have to view it as if I wasn't there, that kid would have gone hungry so a 60 year old woman could feel in charge.", "Good for you, if everyone was this kind more kids would have a chance at rehabilitation", "She pregnant.  She might truly be unable to eat until starving.  It can be like that", "Got it, thanks for clarifying. I maintain that a pregnant, incarcerated teenager is a reasonable circumstance to grant exceptions even if she was not a victim of anything beyond bad decisions and bad luck.", "OP responded to me and said they already do document everything so they're good. I'm just overly paranoid \ud83d\ude05", "Glad to hear you've got those systems in place, that's awesome", "She is pregnant. It very well could be that she can't eat at regular meal times.

Hopefully she can open up to someone to get the help needed to get through everything", "Also NTA", "NTA - and I applaud you for your human and humane treatment of these children (mother and unborn child).  The fact that the other employee needs to try and gather up support against you tell me all I need to know about that person.

And yeah, my very first thought was that any time there's a element of judgment, someone will call favoritism. Especially between a male staff member and female inmate, that goes sideways fast, even if absolutely nothing inappropriate was going on.", "Some DMs I have gotten and people from work would suggest I am. But mostly, after receiving about the 5th work email on it, being attacked from co-workers, I started to wonder if I was actually in the wrong and misreading something.", "Either this is fake or you  aren't a good CO. Because a good CO, wouldn't come on a forum that has nothing to do with their job asking if they are an asshole for letting an inmate \"manipulate\" them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo be clear: Any person who is hungry should be given food. I'm not saying that what makes me question this or what makes you a bad CO.", "NTA. This young girl is pregnant and her eating patterns are all over the place, which is normal. I don't see her as being manipulative but simply as an expectant mother who needed to eat after not eating much earlier. You were kind hearted enough to see past the rules, which were drawn up as a general thing rather than tailor made to individuals' situations.", "NTA, don't give her special food because then she'll starve herself hoping you'll give her something nice at the end of the day, but giving her what the kitchen regularly serves is completely fine, especially considering she's pregnant.", "NTA. You are a good person. She is pregnant, scared and stressed with mood swings. She may not have been hungray at the moment.  You coworker is power tripping. I would keep an eye on your coworker  and report her if she start harassing the girl", "NTA, but the system sure as hell is.", "NTA.  She\u2019s pregnant.  Your coworker gives me a bad vibe, like she wants these kids to needlessly suffer.", "NTA\n\ni feel like this could also count as cruel and unusual punishment. you're withholding food t teach a lesson to a child. you co-worker is on a power trip and needs to chill tf out.  if your co-worker still complains, tell her you're not feeding the child in detention, you're feeding the child within the child in detention who did nothing wrong.", "NTA because kid is pregnant in second trimester and the fetus is growing at a crazy rate. \n\nSecond trimester hunger can be insane and it's a medical need. \n\nI didn't even see much manipulation going on, just that food was asked for.", "Nta you can suffer from 24 hours of nausea, it makes for a miserable pregnancy for sure.  What you were able to eat yesterday turns into not today.  Just a bad smell can and does set it off.  When you have nothing in your stomach and the yellow bile has all been emptied from your stomach, then you can start bringing up blood.  This is also very unpleasant to experience.  After a while your stomach can shrink, this is a very painful tightening around the stomach and can put the unborn babe at risk.  \n\nGoing through it a first time can be quiet frightening and contribute to her overall attitude.  As an adult it was a complete mess and it led to other issues.  Your correct it isn\u2019t about a minor try test the system but a health one.", "NTA - having gone through 3 pregnancies myself, there are issues besides rebelling against the served food at play. Not all women get morning sickness. Some get food aversions, where they can't eat most foods due to smell or texture. I could eat more when not at home with my first. I was ready to put my ex 6 feet under the day he cooked brats in our apartment. The smell was nauseating. This lasted for the first trimester, maybe halfway through my pregnancy. At home I was lucky to down small amounts of applesauce and mashed potatoes. I just couldn't make myself swallow anything else (seriously, eating itself didn't upset my stomach, I just could not get myself to swallow it). If out and away from home, I could tend to down more. Pregnancy and appetite/ability to eat are tricky things. If she will eat sandwiches, that's not exactly filet minon or special food. So you are NTA for prioritizing her baby's needs over whatever food-related issues she may have had with the food from earlier in the day.", "Yeah realistically who is she trying to manipulate here?  I doubt she feels any of these people genuinely care enough for her to care if she eats or not.  Shes pregnant and probably very finicky about food and being served gross food that she can\u2019t stomach.", "It's like the adults in charge have never heard of food aversions. Which are something rarely discussed about pregnancy. It often means you can't physically force your body to swallow many foods, even though it won't result in upset stomach. Now that I know more, I'd have had a supply of high calorie nutritional shakes on hand for myself during during my pregnancies. I could have downed a tiny, 360 calorie drink instead of trying, and failing, to get my throat to cooperate. I learned this later on, as extreme stress causes the same thing to happen. I still get my calories that way. Sandwiches or high calorie meal replacer drinks for meeting nutritional needs are hardly fancy foods by a long shot.", "I'm not sure what point you are trying to make.", "My best friend is 15 weeks into her second pregnancy and the nausea has been BRUTAL on her this time around. She'll be so hungry, try to eat food, and not be able to keep it down. She literally had to got to the ER last weekend over it. \n\nIt could very well be that this resident is experiencing something similar and can't eat on the schedule that is set for residents across the board."]}
