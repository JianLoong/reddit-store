Same with ignoring routines and skipping baths. Kids will be fine. I actually think these short term experiments to prove a point almost always backfire. The man does next to nothing, destroys the house and when his wife comes back he gets to say  *\u201dI took care of the kids all weekend and you still won\u2019t stop nagging over a few dishes in the sink.\u201d* He gets to pretend he did the work and say how easy it was.", "This is a good suggestion.

In the same way I could easily say the husband's earning potential isn't maximized for himself either because he spends more money he earns working alone on his family than himself probably. That seems weird to say, right? Because it is his duty to provide alone monetarily as it is hers to provide caregiving *based on their agreement*", "Not paid monetarily. I understand there is an opportunity cost to being a full time parent but it's not for \"nothing\", unless OP was *forced* into being a stay at home parent. Since she hasn't said it, I won't assume she was forced. In which case it I will assume it was a mutual agreement. He takes care of all the family's bills, she takes care of the kids. He works so *doesn't have to be the primary caregiver*. She's the primary caregiver so doesn't *have to work*. I see it as a mutually beneficial arrangement consensually entered. I also think OP is NTA because it's not funny if the other party isn't laughing. I just wouldn't characterize the plight of stay at home parents as unpaid labour", ">Do you think it's weird for it to be compensated by treating the breadwinner 's paycheck like both spouses' money? Because I think that's what both the OP and the commenter are really asking for\n\nFirst point I wholeheartedly agree with, thanks for putting it this way. No it's not weird to be considered to be both spouse's money. It is his duty to provide that money according to their agreement, and if the husband implied he expected some reward for it, I'd be chewing him out too. \n\n>Believe me, I'm earning our money right now by letting my husband sleep so he can go earn the actual money tomorrow\n\nYou absolutely are. That was never my point. You are earning exactly what he brings in, and he is earning the extra sleep that you sacrifice as a stay at a home parent. Perfect harmony based on both your choices. I would find it really weird if either of you expected an extra reward outside both your mutually agreed duties is what I'm saying.", "I don't think you can simply classify duty as a parent as one thing. In being the stay at home parent OP fulfills one duty of a parent. In being the breadwinner, the husband is doing a different duty as a parent. Because while kids absolutely need the care of a caregiver, they also need to be financially subsidized. Generally, even legal systems agree with this, that's why we have such a thing as a child support and why not performing it is punished as a form of child neglect, just like an absence of caregiving would be.", "With small kids and a house with a yard it's really three full time jobs.

The parent who works outside the home doesn\u2019t get to put their feet up and relax, doing nothing. If they did that, it would mean their spouse is working 24/7.\n\nSorry, hit send too soon. Obviously this guy isn\u2019t pulling his weight at home. If he were, I don\u2019t think his \u201cjoke\u201d would hit so hard.
