I don\u2019t believe he had malicious intent with the joke but he should definitely apologize for making such mistake.\n\nIt also depends on how much truth there was behind that \u201cjoke\u201d, because it technically is his money, but he wouldn\u2019t be able to live the life he has without the effort and work you put, it sounds like you have a lot of teamwork going on and so you should have a say in the financial decisions going on at home, despite it legally being his money", "Being hurt is understandable, and being pissed is as well - but anger is, and I do argue against allowing/engaging, that it is most often rooted in issues to be explored and determined. Do read that as open-thought to engage, free of judgement from you or I or they and time.  \n\nThe arrangement and situation that exists should not be undermined by any concept of money, and that is a reality that you and your partner need to discuss and establish clearly. You've split responsibilities, and that takes understanding from each.\n\nThis point is in front. YNTA, but you have a greater issue to confront. It is quite possible that you will need to be a supreme asshole to sort it out, but I hope not.", "NTA, present him with a weekly or monthly invoice for what it would cost to hire someone to do everything you do around the house, he might rethink what is \"funny\".", "NTA.  Tell him that if you leave him, then the court will make sure that his money is your money.  See if he finds that funny.", "NTA, you let him know that what he said hurt you and he brushes it off?? You are not in the wrong here. If he continues you should make jokes about the food you cooked, the kids you raised, etc. Let him know!!", "NTA\n\nYou are correct. He's letting you know how he truly feels and disguising it as a joke.", "NTA. Look up the price of the work you do and start charging him for Everything. He\u2019ll end up owing you more than he thinks.", "YTA Well he makes the money does he not? And a joke being took this way and the ah-ness is just stupid", "Yes", "NTA but it is his Money", "Yes, op absolutely needs to get her own job and income source.

And many people don't understand how important the work their wife do at home is and they should show some sympathy for it.", "So, men working incredible hours to provide for their families and being away from the children they want to spend time with us a joke as well? And many men work jobs with high mortality rates and break themselves doing those jobs just to provide. \n\nAnd before you bark back at me, you are talking to a guy who is working 80 hours a week in two high risk jobs to provide for my pregnant wife so she doesn't have to work when our child comes(her choice). I get about 5 to 4 hours of sleep most nights. And I've been to the emergency room twice in the past few months doing these jobs. Both in the same week, one for pinching a nerve in my back and messing the nerve up permanently, and the other because my partner and I got attacked by 5 drunk guys. I am giving up on my acting career just to provide.\n\nWe take huge risks for our loved ones, just so they can be comfortable. Being understanding and showing appreciation is not hard. Check your privilege.\n\nWant to talk about a double standards, do what I do. I'd gladly trade places so I can be at home with my wife and child.", "So what if he does know how hard it is? He still did the job that pays them the money. That money came to their home because he earned it. Would he be just as self-righteously upset if she \"joked\" about doing all the child care? When in reality she can only do that child care because he spends all day earning money? It goes both ways.", "And when he acts offended by your bill, tell him \"It's just a joke\" and that he just isn't on your level when it comes to humor.", "This is good advice. And make sure your important documents are safe", "Yeah, husband is working and so he\u2019s getting money put into a pension or retirement plan.

Communication IS everything in a relationship. \n\nHubby may be harbouring feelings like you said and OP is clearly too. I am 100% voting OP NTA, but if this was an advice sub and hubby said that \u201cjoke\u201d  I\u2019d say that it seems both are feeling resentment and the best course of action is to just talk about it.", "It's joint money so it is her money. It's as much hers as it is his. He's providing y for the family and she Providing the childcare for the family.", "And let him pay child care and house cleaning", "Oh no- I don\u2019t think OPs partner is threatening to literally cut financial support from her. He\u2019s just asserting dominance with these dumb \u201cjokes\u201d at the moment.\n\nAnd- that\u2019s why OP needs to communicate to him that these \u201cjokes\u201d are actually hurtful. If he\u2019s genuine he\u2019ll stop with the financial jokes because he\u2019ll see that\u2019s it\u2019s actually hurting his wife. If he keeps on the idea that they\u2019re jokes and that it\u2019s true (it\u2019s all \u201chis\u201d money etc etc) she really needs to decide what to do for herself.", "I think that would be an overescalation at this point, but it's something to keep in mind", ">That money came to their home because he earned it.\n\nAnd he was only able to earn it because she facilitates him working outside the home by doing all the unpaid work. Therefore it is *their money* because *both of their actions are required for that money to arrive in their home* \n\nHim referring to it as his money shows a fundamental lack of respect or understanding of the inherent partnership they have in place.", "Not just the childcare, remember. She's doing laundry, cleaning, shopping, cooking, things that would cost a lot for him to pay to have done. It's about him showing respect for their \\*partnership\\* in making a home. Which at present, he's not. He gives the household money, she gives it her labour and time.", "THEY can only afford THEIR FREE childcare because she stays home.", "The job she is doing has a monetary value in the same way that his does; hers is just invisible because it doesn't directly boost the bank account. If she didn't do it and he had to pay for childcare he'd very quickly understand the monetary value that her contribution has.", "Whose kids? Exactly whose kids?", "Because if she wasn\u2019t caring for them, who would? They\u2019d have to hire a nanny, or pay for daycare. Do you know how much that shit costs? That alone can eat more than a full time job. Her sacrifice to her career is saving them thousands each month in childcare. The only reason he is able to go to work and have a career is because she\u2019s caring for ***their*** kids.", "Ha! I feel like it almost *is* jenga because it\u2019s so extremely rickety and poorly supported!", "ESH. This is so minor.\n\nInstead of complaining about this to Reddit, have a conversation with your husband (without adding in unnecessary emotion) about how your work in keeping the family going is just as vital as his job, and that it sincerely makes you uncomfortable when he calls the money in the back account \"his\" because it reflects a disregard for the efforts you're putting in. \n\nJust be clear and honest. \n\nThen keep doing that for the rest of your marriage if you want to stay together.\n\nSource: A couple that's been married over 20 years.", "Doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good joke", "You don't make \"jokes\" over creating a real worry and fear about financial stuff. That's 100% fucked up.", "She gave 1 example of a joke he made specifically in response to her bringing up making a bet. Where do you get off saying he's not showing respect? Jesus people, he's not allowed to joke about how the only money she has to bet with is the money he made at his job? After being careful to say that their money in their money but God forbid he doesn't saybit correctly every freaking time his overly sensitive wife will go complaining on reddit...", "I think having a direct conversation with husband about her concerns and why she's bothered by that joke would be a more suitable first step. I'm not saying she can never look for a job, just first things first.", "Agree to disagree. For me, this would not be acceptable in a relationship. I don't want my partner to make me feel like household income is 'their' money that I am allowed to use.", "I guess... for me I wouldn't want my wife to be walking around on eggshells for fear of upsetting me since she's working while I'm being the stay at home parent.", "I think you need to learn what a joke and what a veiled insult is.\n\nAn example of a joke is EVERYONE is laughing WITH you.\n\nAn insult is when YOU are laughing AT them.\n\n\nSo if someone doesn't find it funny because it's at their expense, it was never funny to begin with.", "It's very obvious that none = no money from their comment.", "Was there any need for you to say, \u201cYou a comedian?

Some books are written well, some poorly. Some music is played well, some is not. Being Art does not mean everything is exempt from criticism - if you say shitty things in the guise of a joke, people are going to call your ass out on it.
