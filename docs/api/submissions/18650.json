My brother's fiance has 2 kids (6 and 7) and they're both boys. Emma bought a wedding dress that was very expensive and wanted to brag it to the whole family. So she decides to display it in the middle of the kitchen where kids are horseplaying. Honestly, just by the sound of that, it already is a disaster. Well, everyone was socializing and drinking. I was holding a glass of wine while talking to a childhood friend when suddenly one of her kid runs into me causing the wine to fling and it got all over the wedding dress. Her kid got up and started to cry. Emma was furious and she cried. Everyone looked at me like I was at fault. My brother told me to leave.\n\nThat night I was contemplating what had happened when I get a call from my brother. He sounded upset and was talking aggressively demanding for me to pay for the damages I had caused. I told him why he's not blaming the kid. His excuse was \"He's just a kid. Don't bring him into this. You did the damage and should take responsibility for it.\" I was shook and told him that he ran into me and asked him why I was getting all the blame. He then ended the call with \"I don't care, just pay for the damage.\" \n\nLong story short, I called him back and explained to him that I will not be paying for the dress. He was angry and started shouting on the phone saying I'm the biggest asshole he had ever met for not taking responsibility for my actions. I then asked him what actions I caused, but he kept repeating himself saying just to pay for the dress and we can forget about everything. I told him I will not be paying thousands of dollars because a kid was running around and ran into me causing the wine to fling and stain the dress.\n\nLater that night his wife called me and was angry calling me names like \"coward, bastard, bitch, asshole, etc.\" I was upset but didn't let my emotions take over me. I stopped her midway talking and asked where the idea of displaying a expensive white dress in the middle of the kitchen came from. She didn't answer the question and started to call me names again. I hung up and blocked her.\n\nAfter that everyone in my family started contacting me. Mom, sister, brother, etc. They were sending my text messages calling my a bad person. To end the conflict, I paid them $2500. I regret doing it but it's whatever now.

What if he'd knocked a bottle of wine off a table onto it, instead of knocking it out of a person's hands? Would she be blaming the table? Her kid ruined her dress, not you.", "NTA.

I would have died on this hill.", "THIS \ud83d\udc46", "My thoughts...  why on earth would someone fork over $2500 to end a dispute that they aren't responsible for?", "This is exactly right.  Kids run around, and expensive stuff on display is at risk if you let it happen.  \n\nYour SIL is definitely the AH for setting up a disaster then blaming you when it struck.", "The kid's parent was the owner of the wedding dress, which makes it 10\u00d7 worse \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It\u2019s more likely there\u2019s a heck of a lot more to the story that\u2019s being left out.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m wondering? Anyone with consideration would not go near the dress with food or drink in hand.", "What about OP's post implies they are remotely jealous?", "Found OP's brother", "I\u2019m so confused as to why she was displaying it at all?? Like don\u2019t most people keep the dress private until the day of? This is all so weird to me. OP defs NTA and shouldn\u2019t have paid for the damages", "That\u2019s the vibe I\u2019m getting. Something else is already damaged.", "Yup, this was totally planned. Either that, or their complete morons. OP shouldn't have paid.", "Ooooooh my god, that's totally what happened.... it explains *everything*. \n\n(Edit to remove a few paragraphs after reading comment by OP--yes, they went NC with that side of the family! What miserable tits.)", "I've never been in such a situation or anywhere near. \n\nI only know that I DO NOT ACCEPT to be blamed for something I didn't do.

If that was to keep contact, they still shut up. If they don't want to keep contact, let them go", "NTA!!\n\nNow that you've paid for the arrangement, go to the wedding and premeditatedly throw a large glass of wine on the dress\u2026 PLEASE", "Whatever OP wears will be whiter than SIL\u2019s wedding dress.", "They just wouldn't, unless they were rolling in it, and even then...\n\nTo keep the peace? Why would anyone be bothered about keeping the peace with a bunch of moronic assholes anyway?", "Yeah, I think she did this on purpose.  It\u2019s the only thing that makes sense.", "Or SIL", "Fair enuf", "Agreed.", "From the way OP phrases things, I have a feeling this actually happened a while ago and the wedding is long past.\n\nHe talks about the SIL as his brother's wife, and used a \"to this day\" about his brother and family in his comment here that suggests that more than just a couple months have gone by since the incident.", "Wear a dress the color of the stain and then go, \u201cOh look, how cute! We match!\u201d"]}
