My brother's fiance has 2 kids (6 and 7) and they're both boys. Emma bought a wedding dress that was very expensive and wanted to brag it to the whole family. So she decides to display it in the middle of the kitchen where kids are horseplaying. Honestly, just by the sound of that, it already is a disaster. Well, everyone was socializing and drinking. I was holding a glass of wine while talking to a childhood friend when suddenly one of her kid runs into me causing the wine to fling and it got all over the wedding dress. Her kid got up and started to cry. Emma was furious and she cried. Everyone looked at me like I was at fault. My brother told me to leave.\n\nThat night I was contemplating what had happened when I get a call from my brother. He sounded upset and was talking aggressively demanding for me to pay for the damages I had caused. I told him why he's not blaming the kid. His excuse was \"He's just a kid. Don't bring him into this. You did the damage and should take responsibility for it.\" I was shook and told him that he ran into me and asked him why I was getting all the blame. He then ended the call with \"I don't care, just pay for the damage.\" \n\nLong story short, I called him back and explained to him that I will not be paying for the dress. He was angry and started shouting on the phone saying I'm the biggest asshole he had ever met for not taking responsibility for my actions. I then asked him what actions I caused, but he kept repeating himself saying just to pay for the dress and we can forget about everything. I told him I will not be paying thousands of dollars because a kid was running around and ran into me causing the wine to fling and stain the dress.\n\nLater that night his wife called me and was angry calling me names like \"coward, bastard, bitch, asshole, etc.\" I was upset but didn't let my emotions take over me. I stopped her midway talking and asked where the idea of displaying a expensive white dress in the middle of the kitchen came from. She didn't answer the question and started to call me names again. I hung up and blocked her.\n\nAfter that everyone in my family started contacting me. Mom, sister, brother, etc. They were sending my text messages calling my a bad person. To end the conflict, I paid them $2500. I regret doing it but it's whatever now. The only thing that got me upset was that I don't understand why her child didn't get any part of the blame.\n\nAITA?\n\nTLDR; I refused to pay for my brothers fiance's wedding dress after her son ran into me causing the dress to be stained.", "created_utc": 1685559890, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wuwtv/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_brothers_fiances/", "score": 2273, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And that's even discounting the fact that it was their kid that ran into you, causing you to spill the drink\n\nYou were an absolute doormat to pay the money", "NTA\n\nI would have died on that hill.

I paid them $1500 and they still weren't content because after they cleaned the dress, the dress was apparently not \"perfect\" like it was before. That was Emma's words.

I can't wait to read y'all's opinions when I get home.\n\nEDIT: I just didn't hand them the money because I felt like it y'all. I was guilt tripped and was forced into paying them. Everyone wouldn't leave me alone unless I paid. They still wouldn't. I try to ignore them as much as I can, but it's like the whole world thinks I'm the villain of the story. Well, my brother tried to contact me and reconcile, but I refused. I told him that he didn't even think about the hurtful stuff he said to me before letting them out. He's my brother and I love him and will always will. I forgive him, but that doesn't mean I'll ever talk to him or his wife. All the things they said will always leave a mark behind. I don't hold grudges and will never hold grudges, but that doesn't mean I'll forget the things they said. Even my own mother was on their side. Anyways, all of those are in the past now.

Did you like her and have a good relationship before this?", "NTA But $2500 to keep the peace as absolute foolishness maybe it\u2019s time to put some distance between you and your family or at least your soon to be sister-in-law, she sounds like a basket case.", "NTA.\n\nI was prepared to go in a totally different direction than this, but she willingly brought it into a ktichen and had it displayed around food and drink. An accident was very much a possibility and she was accepting that risk by doing so.", "NTA.

What if he'd knocked a bottle of wine off a table onto it, instead of knocking it out of a person's hands? Would she be blaming the table? Her kid ruined her dress, not you.", "NTA.

Obviously, taking OP's side they're NTA. But you have multiple family members who were around wanting them to pay. Something else happened or there was a warning about wine or something. This is too simple for this to be such a big deal.", "NTA First, it was sister-in-law\u2019s idea to display her wedding dress in the kitchen. Next, it was her kid that bumped into you. If you had accidentally tripped and spilt your wine on the dress, I could understand but you didn\u2019t. Their kid caused the damage, they should pay for it. Also, I would go NC or at least LC with your family because they sound ridiculous.", "YTA for paying the money anyway. Have a spine and stand up for yourself. At the very least wait to see what us internet strangers say before making the move. Obviously it was 100% the kid\u2019s fault and also the adult who should\u2019ve been watching him\u2019s. You shouldn\u2019t have had to pay a penny.", "NTA. Your (soon to be) SIL made a stupid decision to show off a wedding dress in an area that has tons of food and drinks all over it.

That's like showing off and demonstrating a toaster in the middle of a pool, she was begging for something bad to happen.", "NTA and honestly I get the vibes that this was a setup.

OP is putting all of the blame on the kid/the bride, but I think most of us would not be drinking wine near someone's wedding dress. \n\nEven if they love OP, that doesn't negate the fact that the dress was ruined and OP (at least partially) helped contribute to that.
