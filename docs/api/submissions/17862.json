Sarah is extremely close to my younger sister Jane 27f, they\u2019re the same age and have a lot in common so they\u2019re extremely close. \n\nMy sister graduated college with a degree in fine arts but has been struggling to get her career as an artist off the ground so she works in something to do with behind the scenes in an art museum and does her art on the side. Last month though one of her coworkers told her a very popular art gallery in town was hosting a competition for local artists where they\u2019d enter and the galley would pick 5 of their favourite artists to showcase their work at a showcase for every weekend of the month of May. Jane entered and won a spot which was really exciting. Sarah and I got dressed up all fancy for the showcase and went along to support Jane. When we were there, Sarah took an instant liking to one of Jane\u2019s paintings. I also like the painting but I\u2019ll be the first to admit I\u2019m not really an art guy and I don\u2019t really \u2018get\u2019 it. I love my sister and I think the painting is really pretty but it almost brought Sarah to tears when she saw it. She went and bought it immediately. I don\u2019t really know of Jane got to pick the price or if the gallery did but it cost $200 which seems kind of pricey since it was the size of maybe the size of a letter. but was definitely worth it for how happy it made Jane. \n\nThe painting arrived and Sarah was so happy but quickly realized she didn\u2019t have anything to hang it up in (it\u2019s not canvas, it\u2019s on some kind of board). She stored it in our spare room for safekeeping while she figures it out. Last week I asked her what she wanted for her birthday (it was yesterday) and she asked if I would take her to see about getting the painting framed and give her the frame as her birthday present. I said sure. At the shop we found out that it\u2019s going to cost 246.84 to get it framed in the standard, not fancy frame. Sarah liked the frame but I refuse to pay more than it cost her to buy the painting to have it framed. It\u2019s a nice painting but no. We went to a different shop, it was only $4 cheaper. I can afford it but I won\u2019t buy the frame. I still refused. Sarah is upset because she says I agreed, and she doesn\u2019t understand why I don\u2019t want to hang something beautiful with sentimental value too boot in our home. I told her we can use a string and a nail like everyone else. She\u2019s been a bit distant and I can tell she\u2019s upset.

What was the point of that?", "YTA. Framing is expensive; that's no secret. You've got the money, the painting is your sister's work that your gf really likes, and it should be properly displayed. Instead you've gone with cheapness because I guess it's more important for you to defend the principle of... not spending more to display art than you did for the art itself?", "YTA. Professional framing is expensive, but it\u2019s worth it for what it adds to the art. Proper framing of art isn\u2019t just beautiful, it does a lot to protect the art from harm. \n\nI\u2019m kind of curious about what the painting is of.", "YTA. It\u2019s her freaking birthday and this is what she wants. You can afford it, so why is this more unacceptable than other $250 gift she might want? It doesn\u2019t matter if you understand why she wants it, it\u2019s her birthday.\n\nFraming is expensive but it protects and beautifies the art while a string and nail will end up with it getting damaged. Just stop.", "YTA\n\n> I don\u2019t really know of Jane got to pick the price or if the gallery did but it cost $200 which seems kind of pricey since it was the size of maybe the size of a letter.\n\nIt\u2019s a painting, not a mass manufactured item. $200 is cheap.\n\nAnd custom framing ALSO is going to cost more than something mass manufactured. Stop acting like custom work is overpriced because it\u2019s not as cheap as something that\u2019s mass manufactured (which may involve exploiting overseas labor.)", "YTA. You asked what she wanted, she told you. Don't ask if you don't really care what she wants. The painting gives her pleasure, what difference does it make what it cost? The frame will add to her pleasure. Price is arbitrary. Van Gogh could barely give his stuff away when he was alive and now it goes for bajillions. Has anything actually changed about the paintings between then and now?", "YTA If your girlfriend wanted something else for her birthday that turned out to cost $250-$300 would you say no, or is it that you don\u2019t value frames, or that you don\u2019t value your sister\u2019s art?\n\nBecause it feels like you\u2019re letting sticker shock get in the way of what was supposed to be a nice thing for your girlfriend\u2019s birthday.", "YTA! You asked what your GF wants for her B-day. She wants the painting framed and you agreed to it. The price quoted is fairly standard for framing a piece of art.", "YTA  \nDon't offer to do something and then renege because you don't think it's worth it. I'm a professional artist, and $200 for an 8X10 (or whatever size it is) is not a lot. The fact that it was picked for a gallery show suggests that your sister has a good amount of talent, and your painting will likely be worth much more than that as she gets more well-known.  \n\n\nRegardless of all that, you're still an ass for not just giving her what she wants for her birthday, especially since it's not even a problem for you monetarily. Having said that, if it's a standard size, you can likely pick up a pre-made frame at any craft store, for next to nothing, that will fit it. They also do custom framing and often have 50% off deals. You can also find custom deals online (if it's an odd size) that don't include all the extras that frame shops are likely to charge you for.\n\nFinally, \"a string and a nail\" is just idiotic and NOT how everyone else does it.", "YTA. She asked for it for her birthday, and it means a lot to her. I know your type; you wouldn\u2019t hesitate to spend that much on yourself if you wanted it, but since your \u201cloved one\u201d wants it you immediately think less of it.", "YTA\n\nYou asked her what she wanted and then said no. Of course you are the asshole here. She sees the value of getting an original piece of art framed professionally, which can prolong the life of the artwork. Don't be stingy after you already offered just because you don't \"get it\".", "YTA. You aren't willing to spend $247 on your gf-of-five-year's birthday present? You say you can afford it, but don't agree with the purchase. Well it's not a gift for you, is it?", "YTA. You should have researched when she first asked on pricing instead of agreeing and taking her to shops. You set her hopes high and then diminished them as well as stomping on something she finds sentimental. It sounds like you\u2019ve been very invalidating of her feelings I\u2019m not surprised she\u2019s taken some space from you.", "I don't know..I've seen frames that are from Walmart or Michael's that take away from the art and make it look cheap...I think art that beautiful deserves  beautiful frame no matter the cost...its about quality...plus the love between your gf and your sis is priceless..whats a 246 dollar frame", "Info: what\u2019s wrong with a ready-made frame from Walmart or something?", "This one is tough. I would also be salty ngl bc man that\u2019s $$$ but YTA bc you did say you would get her this gift. And it\u2019s not money that\u2019s the issue it\u2019s the principle of it. \n\nIf money was the concern then I would let you off the hook but a promise is a promise friend", "YABFA\n\nLike seriously. This is something your PARTNER likes, and sounds like she loves it tbh and she is asking for it to be preserved.\n\nLike seriously. Did you ask what goes on to the framing?  It's not just a simple frame. Any piece you look to have professionally framed is going to cost you but the results are worth it.\n\nYou might as well look at your girlfriend now and say \"if we get married,just dump anything sentimental\"\n\nIf you didnt have the means or she wanted it framed in like bulletproof glass with wood made from the tree of eden. I get it. But this is something so miniscule that would put it he biggest smile on her face and its too much of a hassle cause you dont get it.", "YTA If your girlfriend wanted something else for her birthday that turned out to cost $250-$300 would you say no, or is it that you don\u2019t value frames, or that you don\u2019t value your sister\u2019s art?  \n\nBecause it feels like you\u2019re letting sticker shock get in the way of what was supposed to be a nice thing for your girlfriend\u2019s birthday.\n\nEDIT: Also, $200 isn\u2019t at all pricey for letter-sized original art. I\u2019d expect to pay less for a print, in many cases, but not an original in a gallery.", "YTA. That is pretty normal price for a painting and yes, proper framing will cost about that. It's not just the frame, it is cut to size, glass that will protect the painting and properly mounted. All that means the painting is protected and will last. Stretched canvases tend to be copied prints. You have an original from a gallery quality artist. Your suggestion is really disrespectful to both your GF and your sister as artist.", "YTA. This is something she is so excited about\u2026 something your sister has created that she loves\u2026 and you stomped all over it\u2026 why? You said you can afford it. It\u2019s okay to feel how you feel about it and find the cost to be more than you hoped/expected. I\u2019m not surprised she feels hurt.", "YTA. You said you can afford it, so why not make her happy? If it's the one thing she wants you should find a way to make it work. Even if that means going to more frame shops until you find a lower quote.", "YTA", "YTA, she's upset because you backtracked on agreeing to get her it for her birthday, not the frame/art itself.", "YTA if $250 is within your budget.", "YTA", "YTA if it\u2019s not about affordability, as you say.\n\nI don\u2019t love all my partner\u2019s hobbies, but they aren\u2019t my hobbies. I still get them gifts towards those hobbies because they make them happy.\n\nIf this isn\u2019t about affordability and it would make your GF delighted, then get off your high horse and buy the damn frame.", "YTA.", "There are usually a lot of framed pictures at thrift stores so you could probably frame it yourself cheap. NAH because although you promised it, it\u2019s a lot of money unless you\u2019re very wealthy and you didn\u2019t know that beforehand.", "YTA. Why did you even ask her what she wants for her birthday? Just get her what you want to get her at this point. If you couldn't afford it, this would be a different discussion, but you said you can, so that's not a factor. You got quotes from two shops, so the price is reasonable. If you give gifts based on their value to you and not the person receiving them, I can tell you that you have a long road ahead of you around birthdays and gift-giving holidays", "YTA\n\nIs this really the hill you want to die on?", "So your GF specifically asked for the painting to be framed for her birthday, and you're telling her that you don't respect her judgement of what she would like.\n\nBut you'd pay the same sum of money for something else  *you* deem worthy...\ud83e\udd14\n\nYTA", "ESH why isn't building or buying a used frame an option?", "Awwe shes just proud of your sister and wants to showcase her work...every one sucks here except the sister...I bet her art is lovely", "NAH - It's reasonable for you to balk at that price tag.\n\nYou said this was a small letter-sized painting.

Then the glasses and that varies a lot in grade with conservation glass being worst. She cuts wood and glass herself and sadly fair bit of wastage with custom fits but which still cost her. Then the mounting as she needs to reback to fit frame. Takes her at least a days work on top of cost of components. And her equipment needs to be considered too - special saws for glass which aren't cheap.\n\nEdit: value of framing is frame enhances style by not dominating or making the picture look cheap. The frame protects from crinkles, edge wear, drops. And the glass preserves picture from sun, artificial light glare, and spills. But stopping fade from light most important. And damp protection too as condensation can gather on walls.", "Then pay to have it framed. Michaels (the craft store) does framing and the typically have some sort of sale. That being said framing in general is always going to be more than you want.", "What kind of nice *is* that, then?\n\nFrames aren\u2019t cheap.", "So if the gallery charged $300 for your sister\u2019s artwork then the frame at $250 would\u2019ve felt like a deal? Get over yourself and buy a nice frame.", "A soft YTA then. You asked what she wanted, and now you aren\u2019t following through. Yes it\u2019s expensive (I have yet to figure out why framing costs so much), but you didn\u2019t give her a budget and you know how much she loves this piece. While you don\u2019t value as much, she does and it means something to her.\n\nNext year make sure to give her a budget to stick to (or don\u2019t ask her what she wants) \ud83d\ude02", "$75 is a lot of money, even if you can afford it.", "I usually probably spend anywhere from 100-500. She\u2019s never specified what she\u2019s wanted until now so I usually guess.", "I did a lot of looking around on forums and stuff online", "This is such a great explanation!", "Yup.", "As someone who's had things framed, and has put on frames myself - It's much, much more expensive to have someone else do it. \n\nA shadow box frame of that size (if the canvas is thicker), runs about $15 - $20.  A full wood one would be about $50. \n\nThe costs of professional framing services are much higher due to the costs of risk and insurance factors needing to be built in.", "Yes it would have", "If she had asked for a different gift that cost $250 would you be getting it for her?", "Apparently not a life-changing amount of money if you'd just spent it, but now here you are risking making it a life-changing amount of money by holding onto it. It's your money, your choice, but you asked and YTA.", "I wonder how ring selection is going to work out for you two if you get married.", "You said you can!", "Jesus who are you Mr Crabs?\n\n(Not trying to sound rude)", "So it's just because it's something that you know she wants that you're suddenly being a cheapskate? Or because she bought the painting and you didn't want her to do you're punishing her? Because it's hard to see any other reason for your refusal. You know your attitude is hurting her, that it expresses disdain and disregard for her, and you're cool with that. It's chilling. I hope she kicks you to the kerb. YTA with bells on", "So it\u2019s not even about the money. YTA. The gift is for her. Not for you.", "Thank you kindly \ud83d\udc95", "Came to say this. My husband and I have made many, many frames for the artists in our family. For a small painting you would need only 1 8' length of frame section (max $30), a bit of stain and a friend with a miter box and a tenon saw. Get busy, OP! You can make everyone happy! \n\nIf you won't do this, YTA.", "So just pretend the artwork cost $300. The placebo effect. :-)", "Depending on what it was, yes.", "Neither of us want to get married", "I can", "Just listen to yourself, man! $75 to make two of the most important women in your life happy. And you\u2019re like \u201cwell, if it were for some different objective that I COULD APPRECIATE, I\u2019d be more than happy to pay!\u201d My god.", "\u2026this poor girl needs a better boyfriend.", "Why depending on what it is? Why do you get to choose what she wants?", "Smart girl", "75$ is a 7.5 of weed! 75$ is a video game! 75$ is a negligible amount unless you\u2019re destitute!", "And the other one needs a better brother"]}
