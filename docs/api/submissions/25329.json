This past weekend he completely disregarded me and I cant get it out of my head so I have to know if I was in the wrong. For some context, I was the sober driver to our group of siblings and friends and we had been out at a bar drinking. We all had a great time and headed home. At this point I was the only sober person by a long shot. My husband suggested to go join the neighbors that was a group of middle aged women partying. We don't know them. I went out and told him that it was rude to  invite ourselves to someone else's house without their permission and to leave the idea alone. Not even ten minutes later our other brother who is single came in and told us that my husband was making him feel uncomfortable trying to get him and everyone else to go over there to join the neighbors. So I went back outside and told him to cut it out. I told him he was making our brother and now me, uncomfortable (I was inside cooking food to help everyone sober up and everyone else was outside on the deck). Once I finished, I was slightly annoyed but went outside to join everyone. The next thing I know my husband and his friend (M25) stand up and start walking toward the dock. I asked them what they were doing and he said they were hot so they decided to go jump in the lake. It is pitch black out and they had both had over 7 shots that I counted in addition to many drinks. I told him absolutely not. That is not safe. He rolled his eyes at me and turned to continue walking to the dock. At this point I was pissed. I yelled out to him that was fine. I just wont be the one to tell our kids why their dad died and went back inside to get ready for bed. He ignored me the rest of the night and when I made him come in to have a conversation with me, he kept rolling his eyes. I told him I felt like he disrespected me and owed me an apology for crossing the line. He insisted that he did nothing wrong. I tried to have a conversation to explain why his actions were inappropriate but he didn't see it and instead countered that they didn't even jump in. They just put their feet in. I ended up going to bed and we haven't talked about it since. He thinks things are back to normal but knows that I am being short with him.

That seems excessive unless he's very large or this bar outing lasted many hours.", "NTA\n\nGoing swimming drunk at night IS dangerous.

The y answers are baffling to me. You\u2019re the sober one there are were making the smart choice. You can be annoyed but realistically you need to just make rules for next time.

You shouldn\u2019t have to completely babysit someone when they\u2019re drunk to keep them from doing irresponsible things that could threaten their life.

You have your supporters here. You don\u2019t need me. The only thing I have for you is the truth; you treated your husband poorly and like a child and what you said was dumb and cruel. It also made zero sense.

You don\u2019t know these people piling on your husband and talking shit about him with you, calling him an alcoholic and encouraging you to speak flippantly about HIM DYING.

Just because you know of a place that has managed to avoid deaths does not dismiss the fact that it is a very real risk. I personally know someone who died just jumping off a dock at night while intoxicated, and I tangentially know 3 others. And a college student died that way in my city this past summer.\n\nI grew up on a river and spent most my weekends as a kid water skiing and tubing. Of course you can drink appropriately and have a good time, but completely ignoring the risks is so immature and ignorant. Taking 7 shots on top of a night drinking is absolutely not within the realm of safe drinking and swimming.\n\nEdit: Ah, they already downvoted me and deleted their comment. Hilarious. Like I said, immature.", "We got the kids back, sent friends to the airport, and just really got back settled at home.

Talking to drunk people is rough and you can't really stop them from doing what they want, but what else was she supposed to do? She was the designated sober person. The one that's supposed to keep the others from dying. Pretty irresponsible of the husband to ignore the only level headed person there. Idc how many drinks were had (tho it's possible her words did get through to him as he a) didn't go to the neighbors and b) didn't actually go swimming)\n\nI'd be pissed as hell and would refuse to babysit his drunk ass in the future.

Drunk people are like toddlers, sometimes you gotta restrain them for a minute. What if her husband wanted to drive drunk? Doesn\u2019t she have every right to tell him no and hide his keys? Same logic applies with drunk swimming especially since there are stories of people found in rivers and lakes who drowned after a night out.", "I copy from an article: \"Drinking before swimming is always a dangerous choice because the alcohol distorts your perception of risk and your own abilities.\" Drink people make stupid choices, this is nothing new and the fact that people like you condone that is..... worrying, to day the least.", "Just 4u to know: you can drown in a puddle...even more true when you're drunk", "Yes, that changes everything and makes drunk swimming absolutely safe.", "Then don't do something stupid like say you're going to jump in a lake while obviously impaired\n\nAnd again, how does him dying translate to her abandoning their kids?", "I replied somewhere that I wanted to post here before our conversation. I fully intend to apologize to him for my comment and have a constructive conversation. He's not an alcoholic. He helps around the house and is a good man.

Excuse me? What does her being a woman have to do with anything? And you STILL haven't addressed the comment that she was planning to abandon her children came from.
