At the time I was in no condition to travel. I was 3 weeks out from a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction ( I have been battling breast cancer for 2 years now) and my recovery has been difficult. Two days prior to traveling I had chemo and spacers in my chest filled with fluid. This stretches my chest muscles & tissues so my implants can be placed in. VERY painful. I had 4 drain tubes that needed to be drained, cleaned, and liquid measured multiple times a day. I say all this to paint an honest picture about the shape I was in and everything I was going through. \n\nWe explained to my husband\u2019s family my situation and that traveling 7+ hours on snowy roads in Montana would just not be possible this year. At first they understood, however in the days leading up to Christmas they guilt tripped my husband and I for not coming. On Christmas morning via facetime there is a fight in which my mother-in-law calls me selfish for not letting my husband travel to see his family. \n\nTo make my husband happy, I agreed to the trip. It was awful & I was in an incredible amount of pain and vomiting. We arrived and the first thing his family said was \u201cFinally, took you long enough!\u201d They were not at all grateful for the dangerous trip we just took. While there, no one offered to help me around the house. I was clearly struggling and in pain but no one helped. While there, we had a conversation with his family about how in general we were hurt that they hadn\u2019t reached out to us the past year to check in about my cancer. None of them had called or texted. The conversation overall went well and said they would do better this year supporting us. \n\nThis year the conversation came up with my husband about traveling to Montana for Christmas and I said absolutely no. Their behavior last year was uncalled for and I\u2019m not interested in being around people who treat me like that. Additionally, they never called all year. Never checked in on either of us to see how we were doing. It hurts. I don\u2019t feel like they care that I\u2019m fighting for my life. I have always shown my support when they and their kiddos have been struggling and I am receiving nothing back. I\u2019ve asked my husband to talk to his brother about this and let them know that we will not be coming for Christmas because of their treatment toward us and if they want us around in the future they need to put an equal amount of effort into the relationship. He refuses to have that conversation. He tells me to \u201cget over it\u201d. I\u2019m trying to explain to him that I want to have a relationship with his family but it needs to be a healthy one. \n\nI want my husband to stand up for me when he sees I\u2019m being hurt. Do I just let it go? I do this for him with my family, why can\u2019t he do the same? Am I the asshole for asking him to do this?", "created_utc": 1702276442, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18fo9hg/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_talk_to_his_family/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not an a-hole.  His family really stole that award.  Your request is reasonable, but it is possible he fears that if he says those things that it will be an end to his relationship with his family.\n\nYou should not be subjected to that again, and I would say that if he cannot bring himself to have that conversation at this point, that staying home with you might be the support you should except at this moment in time. \n\nHe should not expect you to go back there, and he should just be prepared to tell them that it was too difficult last year and you cannot do it this year.  He does not owe them any further explanation.\n\nI'm sorry that they did not give you the support they promised, and I am continually amazed at people's utter lack of empathy.", "NTA, your husband and his family is though, you should not even have to ask him.", "NTA I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this.\nIf he wants to go he can. \nStay home and take care of yourself.\n If he can\u2019t respect you enough to say something to them he\u2019s just as big of a problem as them. \n\nWith everything you\u2019re going through you shouldn\u2019t also have to spend what is supposed to be a time of joy being mistreated .", "It's absolutely horrible what you went through last year. No one should have pushed you to visit, and the fact that your husband allowed his family to bully and blame you when you were in such a fragile medical state is very alarming to me. Then to actually go anyway and have no one help you or be grateful that you came? Wtf?\n\nI'm sorry OP, but your husband's family is only a small part of the issue here. He is telling you to \"get over it\" and dismissing the fact that you were terribly mistreated. That is not a good husband. It's just not. He cares more about maintaining a relationship with people that don't care about you than he cares about your actual health and well-being, or your feelings, or you being abused by his family.\n\nI left my husband for vaguely similar reasons (started with him becoming hostile when I got sick) and you know what..... What my ex did isn't as bad as what yours did to you. And yes, my ex got worse too, and I doubt yours will improve either. He has shown you where his priorities are. It's not you. Believe him. You deserve better.", "NTA. Husband needs to step up and defend you, not tell you to 'get over it'. Family sounds like a bunch of assholes who don't give a shit about what you're going through. Don't let them guilt trip you into sacrificing your health for their selfishness. Husband should talk to his family and set some boundaries, or else they can all go fuck themselves with a cactus.", "NTA and im appalled at the way your husband treated you. It's not like you had a booboo on your knee or a cold. You have fucking cancer and you had surgery. You should have been at home being cared for. What the hell.", "NTA your husband is the biggest AH here because he first dragged you on a trip you should never have taken and you also said no one helped you there, assume that includes him.\n\nThen he tells you to get over it and refuses to back you up by talking to them.\n\nYou know what's worse than going through a health crisis on your own?

He put your life in danger making that drive when you were going through that. What if you got an infection from someone/something there? You need to ask yourself what you\u2019re willing to tolerate and what if your mental and physical wellbeing are more important than him and his family.", "Your husband is a massive AH. He should have stood up to his parents last year. There is no way he should have let you travel. \n\nNo, you don\u2019t let this go. Maybe let him go to his parents on his own, but make it clear you won\u2019t be treated poorly by his family or by him again. \n\nNTA, and I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you", "NTA. \n\nAs a witness to multiple BC survivors' journeys, not only is the family a major AH, but your husband is the biggest AH of all. \n\nYour husband chose his family (who seem like unthoughtful d bags to him and you) last year during a very painful and vulnerable time for you that honestly  could have jeopardized your recovery but now he just wants you to act like everything is fine. \n\nHe is the problem in more ways than 1.", "NTA, as someone who has been there (got my 5 year NED in June) that trip sounds like hell.\n\nYour husband absolutely should have supported you last year.", "NTA\nMy goodness that must have been awful. Wow. Stay home, don\u2019t give in. And tell your husband he needs to step up.", "NTA. Something that many people seem to not understand is that there are families who only consider the partners an addition. Sometimes an useful one, sometimes a not useful, but never a real person and never a family member and, what's important to understand, surely not a human being.\nTo them, your cancer only was an inconvenience because of Christmas plans, nothing more, and they weren't polite enough to hide it. \n\nThere's no \"putting equal effort.\" There is \"you don't even consider me a human being, why do you suddenly want to spend the day with me when every other day of the year you don't even care if I'm alive?\"\n\nDon't go and ruin their \"big family reunited at Christmas\" pretty picture", "NTA. I cannot believe your husband did not put his foot down the first time.  If he's going to be a ass stay home and do something for yourself. Do you have your own family. I'm sorry for what you are going through, you do not need this on top. Unfortunately your husband is as bad as his family when it comes yo selfishness.", "NTA, your problem is NOT your inlaws but your AH husband. He seen the condition you were in yet still made you travel,.not for a life-threatening emergency but just to appease his family. \n\nThat is not a supportive husband, no one in your condition should have embarked on that journey. Post-operative Sepsis is a life threatening condtion and given your level of immunity and the number of potential wounds you had, it could have at the least put you in hospital or worse. \n\nSend the worlds best husband to see his family, while you stay home, find friends or family to spend the holidays with, and seriously reconsider what your future looks like, especially after fighting cancer for 2 years. You deserve much more care and compassion than what you have received so far.", "why do you even want a relationship with such awful, and selfish people?? their behavior is intentional and they intestinally mistreated you. \n\nThey don't like you, or maybe don't want you in their life, that's why they don't call you or support.\n\nThe more you will expect hurtful people to behave good, the more they will behave hurtful, toward you and the more they hurt you the more you will get hurt.\n\nYou biggest problem is your husband not supporting you.\n\nNTA", "You are NTA, but your husband is a huge Ah. He needs to start supporting you and standing up to his family.\n\nI think you need to sit down and have a serious conversation with your husband about how hurtful it is that he is fairly to support you, and is not standing up to his family over their behaviour. HE needs to be in your comer. So far, he seems to be showing you pretty clearly that his priority is his family, not the family formed of you and him, and that it's so deeply intrenched that he was willing to drag you for along journey when you were in extreme pain, and then fail to ensure that you have a basic level of comfort once you arrived. And it sounds as though he is still not acknowledging how awful that experience was, or how inappropriate his family's behaviour is and was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would tell him that you will not be travelling to his families home, . If he decides to go anyway, then have a peaceful, calm, relaxed time yourself and then decide whither this is someone you want to keep in your life.", "You are 100% right, he really does fear that the conversation could result in his family pulling away and ending their relationship. I don't want that, not at all. I just want healthy boundaries and respect. Mostly I want  my husband to stand up for me \ud83d\udc94", "They didnt steal the award of a-holeness, they are the rightful owners...ffs, who demands a person who s gone through all that to travel? \n\nOP, i m sorry for what you ve been going through and i pray for speedy recovery..your husband though...i dont get how he last year had the convo with his family and you were both hurt by their behavior but this year says to let it go.. Stay home and tell him he can do as he wishes...you will then know what is more important to him, his family or your family..", "NTA.  What relationship? They don\u2019t reach out on their own, they make no effort to be involved in his or your life, I bet they don\u2019t visit either. They treat his sick wife who just had surgery like absolute crap and he did nothing.\nIt\u2019s time to ask him what relationship he seems scared of loosing when he doesn\u2019t really have one anyways. But IS at risk of damaging his relationship with you. He should have stood his ground and not went last year for the sake of your health. At the minimum he should have stood up for you for how they treated you. There is no excuse for that.\n\nDon\u2019t bother to go this year. He can go if he wants but don\u2019t subject yourself to them. You\u2019re not stopping him from having a relationship with them but make it clear you will no longer be around them because of how they treat you. Since he won\u2019t stand up for you, you are standing up for yourself. \n\nI would seriously recommend marriage and individual counseling for the both of you. Because this will fester between you until he realizes how badly he failed you and actually starts standing up for you.\n\nBest wishes to you", "Here is the thing, if my family treated my husband this way, I wouldn\u2019t want a relationship with them. The biggest AH is your husband. He should have insisted you both stay home last year. I\u2019m sorry you married such a selfish person"]}
