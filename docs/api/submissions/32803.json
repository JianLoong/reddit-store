At the time I was in no condition to travel. I was 3 weeks out from a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction ( I have been battling breast cancer for 2 years now) and my recovery has been difficult. Two days prior to traveling I had chemo and spacers in my chest filled with fluid. This stretches my chest muscles & tissues so my implants can be placed in. VERY painful. I had 4 drain tubes that needed to be drained, cleaned, and liquid measured multiple times a day. I say all this to paint an honest picture about the shape I was in and everything I was going through. \n\nWe explained to my husband\u2019s family my situation and that traveling 7+ hours on snowy roads in Montana would just not be possible this year. At first they understood, however in the days leading up to Christmas they guilt tripped my husband and I for not coming. On Christmas morning via facetime there is a fight in which my mother-in-law calls me selfish for not letting my husband travel to see his family. \n\nTo make my husband happy, I agreed to the trip. It was awful & I was in an incredible amount of pain and vomiting. We arrived and the first thing his family said was \u201cFinally, took you long enough!\u201d They were not at all grateful for the dangerous trip we just took. While there, no one offered to help me around the house. I was clearly struggling and in pain but no one helped. While there, we had a conversation with his family about how in general we were hurt that they hadn\u2019t reached out to us the past year to check in about my cancer. None of them had called or texted. The conversation overall went well and said they would do better this year supporting us. \n\nThis year the conversation came up with my husband about traveling to Montana for Christmas and I said absolutely no. Their behavior last year was uncalled for and I\u2019m not interested in being around people who treat me like that. Additionally, they never called all year. Never checked in on either of us to see how we were doing. It hurts. I don\u2019t feel like they care that I\u2019m fighting for my life. I have always shown my support when they and their kiddos have been struggling and I am receiving nothing back. I\u2019ve asked my husband to talk to his brother about this and let them know that we will not be coming for Christmas because of their treatment toward us and if they want us around in the future they need to put an equal amount of effort into the relationship. He refuses to have that conversation. He tells me to \u201cget over it\u201d. I\u2019m trying to explain to him that I want to have a relationship with his family but it needs to be a healthy one. \n\nI want my husband to stand up for me when he sees I\u2019m being hurt. Do I just let it go? I do this for him with my family, why can\u2019t he do the same?

Then to actually go anyway and have no one help you or be grateful that you came? Wtf?\n\nI'm sorry OP, but your husband's family is only a small part of the issue here. He is telling you to \"get over it\" and dismissing the fact that you were terribly mistreated. That is not a good husband. It's just not.

You need to ask yourself what you\u2019re willing to tolerate and what if your mental and physical wellbeing are more important than him and his family.", "Your husband is a massive AH.

Wow. Stay home, don\u2019t give in. And tell your husband he needs to step up.", "NTA. Something that many people seem to not understand is that there are families who only consider the partners an addition. Sometimes an useful one, sometimes a not useful, but never a real person and never a family member and, what's important to understand, surely not a human being.\nTo them, your cancer only was an inconvenience because of Christmas plans, nothing more, and they weren't polite enough to hide it. \n\nThere's no \"putting equal effort.\" There is \"you don't even consider me a human being, why do you suddenly want to spend the day with me when every other day of the year you don't even care if I'm alive?\"\n\nDon't go and ruin their \"big family reunited at Christmas\" pretty picture", "NTA. I cannot believe your husband did not put his foot down the first time.  If he's going to be a ass stay home and do something for yourself. Do you have your own family. I'm sorry for what you are going through, you do not need this on top. Unfortunately your husband is as bad as his family when it comes yo selfishness.", "NTA, your problem is NOT your inlaws but your AH husband. He seen the condition you were in yet still made you travel,.not for a life-threatening emergency but just to appease his family. \n\nThat is not a supportive husband, no one in your condition should have embarked on that journey. Post-operative Sepsis is a life threatening condtion and given your level of immunity and the number of potential wounds you had, it could have at the least put you in hospital or worse. \n\nSend the worlds best husband to see his family, while you stay home, find friends or family to spend the holidays with, and seriously reconsider what your future looks like, especially after fighting cancer for 2 years. You deserve much more care and compassion than what you have received so far.", "why do you even want a relationship with such awful, and selfish people?? their behavior is intentional and they intestinally mistreated you. \n\nThey don't like you, or maybe don't want you in their life, that's why they don't call you or support.\n\nThe more you will expect hurtful people to behave good, the more they will behave hurtful, toward you and the more they hurt you the more you will get hurt.\n\nYou biggest problem is your husband not supporting you.\n\nNTA", "You are NTA, but your husband is a huge Ah. He needs to start supporting you and standing up to his family.\n\nI think you need to sit down and have a serious conversation with your husband about how hurtful it is that he is fairly to support you, and is not standing up to his family over their behaviour. HE needs to be in your comer. So far, he seems to be showing you pretty clearly that his priority is his family, not the family formed of you and him, and that it's so deeply intrenched that he was willing to drag you for along journey when you were in extreme pain, and then fail to ensure that you have a basic level of comfort once you arrived. And it sounds as though he is still not acknowledging how awful that experience was, or how inappropriate his family's behaviour is and was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would tell him that you will not be travelling to his families home, . If he decides to go anyway, then have a peaceful, calm, relaxed time yourself and then decide whither this is someone you want to keep in your life.", "You are 100% right, he really does fear that the conversation could result in his family pulling away and ending their relationship.

Stay home and tell him he can do as he wishes...you will then know what is more important to him, his family or your family..", "NTA.  What relationship? They don\u2019t reach out on their own, they make no effort to be involved in his or your life, I bet they don\u2019t visit either. They treat his sick wife who just had surgery like absolute crap and he did nothing.\nIt\u2019s time to ask him what relationship he seems scared of loosing when he doesn\u2019t really have one anyways. But IS at risk of damaging his relationship with you. He should have stood his ground and not went last year for the sake of your health. At the minimum he should have stood up for you for how they treated you. There is no excuse for that.\n\nDon\u2019t bother to go this year. He can go if he wants but don\u2019t subject yourself to them. You\u2019re not stopping him from having a relationship with them but make it clear you will no longer be around them because of how they treat you. Since he won\u2019t stand up for you, you are standing up for yourself. \n\nI would seriously recommend marriage and individual counseling for the both of you. Because this will fester between you until he realizes how badly he failed you and actually starts standing up for you.\n\nBest wishes to you", "Here is the thing, if my family treated my husband this way, I wouldn\u2019t want a relationship with them.

I\u2019m sorry you married such a selfish person", "NTA\n\nFact is, your husband decided last christmas that he would rather you die on the way to montana than standing up for you. He would have may just tossed your dead body out of the car to not be late for his family visit. \n\nWhy aren't you divorced yet? Your husband literally doesn't care if you die as long he can please his family!! Thats horrible.", "Info : did you know your husband was a doormat before marrying him ?", "Let your husband go his family. \n\nIt's once a year.\n\nYou stay home or go visit your family. \n\nThere is no need to argue.\n\nEach of you do you own thing and meet up back home.", "Your husband is the major issue here.\n\nHe put your health and life in danger numerous ways last year. \nYou said you agreed just to make your husband happy, I see that as he was showing you he was upset/disappointed that he couldn't go, and that is an AH move, making you feel bad so you give in.\n\nYou also said no one helped you or supported you whilst you were there. The way that reads is that not even your husband helped you, and that is an even bigger AH move on his behalf.\n\nNow he is telling you to get over it.

I would not get over it and him asking you to suggests he doesn't understand how fucking bad it was last yr or doesn't care.", "NTA After the first passive aggressive remark, he shoulda packed you and everything right back into the car and brought you home. I don\u2019t want to write off your husband as fruit from the same tree, but indifference appears to be relatively common theme for his family and they feel it second nature to disregard every one but themselves, and he is reflecting some of that behavior too. I would suggest he go solo but if he goes and you are still  recovering and having a hard time finding it in him to offer support willingly, think about how that translates and what his actions honestly mean for gauging this support system", "Nta. We all want a spouse who supports us. You don't have one. I'm sorry you found out this way. You take care of yourself. Your husband clearly couldn't care less. This isn't about his family.  Its about him. You deserve better. Good luck.", "You're NTA, but you're sadly mistaken for thinking your husband is on your side. He cares more about his original family than his family with you. Send him home to mommy-dearest. And change the locks.", "NTA, but you're married to one and his family.  I cannot imagine literally fighting for my life and my husband not having my back.  Not only not having my back, but actively working against me!  Literally prioritizing them while you are hanging off a cliff.  \n\nI'm so sorry you're having to go through this.  I would let the discussion go because you've seen that that isn't going anywhere.  But I wouldn't go to them, either.  Tell him he's welcome to go and have a good time.  You'll be home enjoying the peace and quiet.  And don't budge.  Don't fight with him, don't have the discussion anymore, and just draw the line.  I hope your health improves and you lose the big problems, including him and his.  \n\nA visit with an attorney might be a nice little self-present this Christmas.  I'd also seriously consider some personal, not couples, therapy to deal both with the emotions over the cancer and the feelings about his treatment of you.  The anxiety and pain they are causing cannot be helping with your recovery.", "NTA.\n\nThe apples don't fall far from the tree.  Your husband sounds like he's cut from the same cloth of assholery as the rest of his family.\n\nEverybody in this story is an asshole except for you.", "NTA\n\nYou can \u201cget over it\u201d by getting rid of the lot of them, your husband included. Life is too short to be shackled to rude people. You, more than most, will understand that on a deeper level.\n\nThat is not how a caring family acts. If my SIL was going through something like that, we\u2019d all be waiting on her hand and foot. You deserve that too.", "NTA\nYour husband could clearly see that you were being hurt and did nothing about it. His family was treating you horribly while you were battling with a painful situation. They did not even call to check in and see how you were feeling. You should not tolerate this behavior and you should avoid visiting them if you don\u2019t want to. Your husband should have done something about it considering it was his family  and should have stood up for you because of how his family was treating you in your horrible condition they obviously showed no care and no respect and when you agreed to come they were extremely rude and ungrateful towards you even though you came a long way to see them and make them happy. They did not even help you around the house while you were battling with cancer and clearly in pain.", "A few years ago, I lived through the EXACT treatment and surgery you describe, almost the same timeframe - late November surgery. Even by Christmas I was in NO shape to be travelling or making nice for relatives. My husband was my most amazing support and arranged all kinds of things to make Christmas relaxing for me and beautiful for the kids, with full support of both our families. I am SO SO sorry you didn't experience that, and honestly, your husband needs to step up. That kind of surgery is not just physically draining, it had an emotional impact that was even more powerful than I expected. If his family get to dictate everything, with no understanding for what's going on in your lives, then how is that a healthy relationship? My best wishes for a peaceful Christmas and ongoing healing.", "NTA. This is similar to the situation I am in with my Husbands family but I am not battling cancer, so makes your Husband an AH for not sticking by your side and telling his family what they did was wrong, it is not your job to do that it is his. His family, his problem.", "Sorry to hear about your tough journey but you should never have made that journey last year and a loving husband would not have even suggested going. You don\u2019t have a good husband. Your in laws and him are AH\u2019s. And you really need to think about your relationship. No good human being would have put you in that situation to begin with. Let alone ask you to just get over it.", "At this point you are actually lucky he hasn\u2019t left yet. 75 percent of women that get breast cancer husbands or partners leave them. He\u2019s never doing to stand up for you and you are fighting a losing battle. The fact he wanted to go to his families instead of staying home to take care of you says all you need to know", "Don\u2019t let it go.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell him that they \"can get over it\" if you guys dont show up!", "His mom must be so proud of the asshole she raised...", ">come to Jesus talk\n\nI had to look up the phrase.  But I agree with you 100%.", "He doesn't seem to have any interest in standing up for you so you have to stand up for yourself. I'm sorry.", "He's shown you he won't.  He's tossed his fighting-for-her-life wife under the snowplow to protect a lousy \"relationship\" with a lousy family.  You need to be able to make decisions based not on what you want but on what is.  Those healthy boundaries and respect need to come from him and not worried about with them -- because he'll manage them.  I'm so sorry you're going through this.", "Yeah, that's not gonna happen.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like he will cause he had a whole year to make some boundaries and he never did.  I\u2019m not gonna jump on the divorce him bandwagon but I do suggest you let him go to his family, maybe turn off your phone so they don\u2019t bother you, send your husband a text before you  do saying you guys need to talk when he comes back. I would definitely suggest couples counseling.", "Great post, except for one thing.  I think couples counseling is recommended too often before individual therapy has had a chance to kick in.  There's too much opportunity for the really disfunctional individual to use the other person's honesty against them.  The RDI isn't going to be honest and open.  They already *don't care.*  And they can often pull the wool over a therapist's eyes."]}
