Probably you aren't loud and yelling like kids.", "If you have a good relationship with your neighbors just have a conversation. Without blaming or finger pointing. \nBut in the end they don\u2019t have to comply. And kids be kids. When they grow older they probably won\u2019t be such early birds anyway. So in the grand scheme of things I would prioritize a good relationship with your direct neighbor over a small (albeit annoying) issue. \n\nYou can use earplugs, white noise and other tools to mute the noises. \n\nNTA unless you will be hostile if they don\u2019t comply with your request", "NTA.

Unless they're breaking any ordinance laws/rules if they're too loud, there might be very little that you can expect and could upset the friendship in the process.

You would be within your rights to ask nicely if they could perhaps play on the other side of the house or keep it a bit quieter until 7-8am. \n\n\nNoise/nuisance laws normally prohibit excessive noise prior to 7am and there is a nice way to ask them to keep you in mind. Perhaps mention that you notice they are asleep earlier than you and you do your best to minimize noise at night. \n\n\nWhite noise machines are worth their weight in gold.", "If their kids are outside at 630 in the morning, then NTA.
