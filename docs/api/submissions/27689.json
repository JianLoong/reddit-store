According to his mistress, he told her they were separated, just not divorced (This is relevant). She was already fragile due to years of trying to conceive and not being able to. They tried everything and were about to do IVF when they split. It was a bad time for her, she tried to salvage her marriage but it was painfull for both parties.

He is an independent professional and travels for months at a time so they kept things light between them. When things got serious he opened up and said he was married, separated from his wife just not divorced. She was livid and ended things. I frankly believed him. Lisa found out later she was pregnant. She was so afraid to loose the child she only opened up to me when she was 17 weeks along and told her family much later than that. \n\nShe didn't want to tell Dan about the child. I was surprised, tried to understand why and was concerned that she was keeping this a secret just for fear of being rejected. then covid came along and we were all concerned about other things. Here's the thing, Dan kept contact with me via social media and often asks about her. It's been a couple of years, he's divorced and wants to know how she is doing. I know he loved Lisa very much. And apparently he still does. Also, doesn't the child deserve to have a father?\n\nMyself and Mary are the only ones who know about this. This friend says it's a total ah move to tell Dan about this, it should be her choice. I don't agree and think she is keeping a child away from his father. I do believe if her divorce hadn\u2019t been so messy and the ex such a sob, she would be more receptive to D., at least to him being in the child life.\n\nMary is totally against speaking with Dan., said i should mind my own business and at the most should run this idea by Lisa. She also pointed they live in different countries so custody would be a mess. Mary also warn me i would be losing a friend if i did that. \n\nSo WIBTA if i told Dan about the child? Should i just keep quiet about this?\n\nEdit: changed letters to names", "created_utc": 1695763265, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16t0ewu/wibta_if_i_told_him_he_had_a_child/", "score": 159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And it's her right to tell him.  If later when the kid is an adult and wants to reach out, you can help connect them. I'm sorry its just she has the right to decide for the kid, and so far as she is not abusive, then its only her business to share.", "YWBTA. If you believed Dan's story, you're a moron. That's the standard bs cheaters tell people whom they are cheating with to keep them once the hook. \nDan is a scummy lowlife. Your friend is lucky to not have him in her life and you want to invite him back in for her? Absolutely disgusting.", "YWBTA\n\nYou would be crossing the line by revealing to the father that he has a child and nothing good would come of it. What you can do is talk to Lisa. You can try to understand why she doesn't want to involve the dad in their child's life.\n\nHer reasons may be legitimate or selfish and you can talk to her about it if she opens up to you, but you shouldn't inform the father of your own accord and you could end up doing more harm than good by getting involved.", "YWBTA.\n\nIf Dan was honest he wouldn't have waited to tell your friend that he was married.\n\nWhether or not you believe him isn't relevant, because it wasn't your relationship and you were not privy to the inner workings of that relationship.\n\nYour friend is the child's caregiver, not you or dan.\n\nAs others have pointed out, you don't actually know if that's even Dan's baby.\n\nThis is not the way to support your friend; it's a way to jump the gun and interfere without being in full possession of the facts.\n\nMaybe Dan will find out at some point, the future is not written in stone.\n\nYou're playing around with stuff you should be respecting, and your question about the child deserving to have a father shows that this is about your values, your perceptions and your feelings, which.....\n\nNot. Your. Relationship.", "YWBTA if you told Dan - doubly if you were not even going to talk to Lisa about this. Absolutely you should tell Lisa you've been in contact, and start the subject with her from there. I agree Dan deserves to know, and the child needs to know also, but that's (edited) not (end edit) up to you to do directly.", "I'm not going to judge bc I understand both perspectives but it's her call not yours. By admitting you keep in touch she's going to feel betrayed and by telling him he has a child she's going to feel betrayed. Be her friend first and the instigator second. If at all.", "YWBTA if you tell Dan anything. I would talk to Lisa and let her know that Dan has been asking about her online. You can give her your opinion that he has a right to know about the child, but be prepared for pushback. This is not worth ruining a friendship over.", "Info: why do you feel like it\u2019s your responsibility to make decisions about your friends life, and child?", "NTA if you told him, though technically not your business. But it will likely come at the price of the friendship...\n\nHow about: you start by telling Lisa how devastated D is to have lost her and that he is likely still in love with her, and was also honest about the divorce. Give her a chance to warm up to him again...", "YTA if you tell him.\n\nThis is not your business. You don't need to be involved here.", "YWBTA. Talk to Lisa first and see why she distrusts Dan so much. Perhaps there are other reasons she didn\u2019t tell you about. This would be a violation of her trust if you just tell him, and ruin your relationship forever.", "It is NONE OF YOU BUSINESS!  Stay out of other peoples lives and just worry about your own.  What YOU think doesn't really matter.", "No No No. Mind your own business. If the child\u2019s mother wants to tell the father she can. Stop trying to police other people\u2019s behavior, especially when deep emotions are involved. It\u2019s a horrible personality trait. If you do this don\u2019t be surprised if your whole circle of friends tells you to F off.", "YTA. Not your circus, not your performers. Keep your nose out of their business and move on.", "YWBTA because it\u2019s not your life and not your place. You will lose a friend, possibly cause havoc in your friends life, cause a potentially messy custody battle that could result in more drama for the kid - especially parents in different countries.\n\nIs Lisa also an AH for not telling him? Yes, absolutely. But it doesn\u2019t make this your responsibility to tell him. You should talk to Lisa and let her know about all of this, it may change her mind.", "YTA this is none of your business she is your friend not Dan and that is where your loyalties should be and you should do what she wants. You have no idea what can of worms you would be opening, it is not your place to tell him stay out of it.", "Yes ywbtah. It isnt your place. It is hers.  You should talk to her to explain that the child deserves the chance to have his father but definitely do not go behind her back to tell him. It will definitely put a stop to your friendship with her.", "YWBTA. Run it by Lisa to tell him and then it\u2019s out of your control.", "YWBTA. This is not for you to share.\n\nThis isn't your ex. This isn't your child. You are just guessing that the only reason Lisa broke up with him was because the situation was the same as what caused her divorce. You don't know if there were other reasons.\n\nWhen the child starts asking his mom who his father is, Lisa will have to tell him who it is and why she never told his father about him. He can then make his own informed decision about contacting his bio-dad.\n\nI wonder why you think that NOW is the time to meddle? What's the rush OP?", "YWBTA.  OP, I promise you, if you tell him, you will destroy your friendship.  And you would absolutely be an AH and a shitty friend.  If you want to try and convince your friend to talk to him, do that.  But under no circumstances should you betray her.", "This is a tricky one.  But, yes, YWBTA if you went behind her back and told the father.  Not your pig, not your farm.  \n\nDoes he have a right to know?  In the abstract, yes.  But that\u2019s a whole can of worms that will explode in your face if you do this.  You\u2019ll be making a monumental judgment call in a situation where you don\u2019t have to deal with the actual consequences.  Worst case scenario\u2026she loses her child.  Potential custody battles.  Money spent on lawyers.  Possible harassment from the father.  Truth is, you don\u2019t really know this guy.  You don\u2019t have any real idea of how this would all go down.  And yes, you would absolutely lose your friend over this.  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to like it.  You don\u2019t have to approve of it.  But if you want to keep your friend, you have to accept her choices.", "YWBTA. It is not your place to get involved, and you don't know what went on behind the scenes that she may not have told you about. Don't blow up her and her child's life (and throw away your friendship) over something you may not even fully understand.", "YWBTA. She has her reasons for not telling him and violating her trust in you (as the only person she trusted enough to tell) would be a line I doubt you\u2019d ever be able to come back over. If I were her, I might even be upset to learn that you still talk to him depending on how hurt she was by things\u2014just a thought.", "Listen to Mary.\n\nYWBTA and should probably cut ties with Dan too.  It's Lisa's story to tell when and if she wants to.", "Yes you need to mind your own business, you would be TAH if you told him about the baby.  So don't butt in where you've been told not to go.", "YWBTA you've no idea what actually went on in their relationship. You could try talking to the mom to find out her reasons. But it's not your place to tell him.\n\nI have a friend who did the same thing. Turns out behind closed doors he was horribly abusive to her (my friend) it took me 10 years to get her to open up about it.\n\nShe literally kept her child a secret to protect herself.", "YWBTA. Keep your mouth shut. It's not your place to say a damn thing. If Lisa decides to tell him, she will. It's HER business, not yours. If you can't keep your mouth shut and/or your fingers still, throw your phone away, wipe your computer and throw it away, and move to the middle of bumfuck nowhere with no internet, no 5G, and no people for thousands of miles.", "YTA if you tell \n\nIt\u2019s not your business or place to say anything to him \n\nIt\u2019s weird you even entertain him asking you about your friend \n\nThis alone would make me cut you out as a friend \n\nTelling him would guarantee your friend cuts you off. \n\nInstead change tactics. Talk to her. Tell her he\u2019s asking about her and that he seems to still love her. Tell her that her child deserves a father and let her make that choice.", "Ywbta. It's not your business to tell him. You'd lose your friend and any remaining friends due to not keeping your mouth shut on this. It's not your child, it's not your business to speak about it.", "YWBTA. You know only the glimpses of the story that Lisa shared with you, and whatever Dan has told you about it. You don\u2019t know the whole story and it\u2019s not your business or place to meddle. It strikes me that you must not be a very close \u201cbest friend\u201d if you have kept your communication with him secret this long, and I\u2019m guessing that, in turn, she hasn\u2019t told you everything.\n\nWhat you COULD do is be honest with Lisa that you have kept in contact with Dan and he has been asking about her. \n\nMeddling \u201cfriends\u201d have gotten women killed. Don\u2019t assume that just because Dan \u201cseems like\u201d a good guy that Lisa doesn\u2019t have good reasons to have completely cut all contact and not tell him about his child.", "YTA. This is none of your business and not your story to tell.  I would drop you FAST if you did this to me.  Also for still keeping in contact", "YTA, mind your business. How many times has this guy been married? If your friend is raising her son well and he\u2019s loved and cared for, I personally don\u2019t see how having a likely absentee and cheating father in his life would make his life better, but that\u2019s really not for any of us to decide, it\u2019s for your friend to decide.", "Yes, YWBTAH if you told Dan. What's it to you? Are you in a moral high horse generally in life? Seriously, what's it to you? It almost reads like you care more for Dan than your friend. She has her reasons. Don't invade & blow up her life just to satisfy your whatever it is that's driving you. If father & kid upload DNA, they'll find each other eventually.", "YTA", "YWBTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnless you're cool with blowing up your friendship, mind your business.

But he was NOT divorced in the ENTIRE TIME he was dating your friend -- a few years, by your account.  Divorces that take THAT long are rare as finding a gem quality emerald at one of those places that let you dig up your own rocks and pan for gold.", "Why are you still friends with someone who lied to your best friend for so long? It sounds like you didn't know him before. I wonder about your motivations, honestly, though I can understand the dilemma.", "ESH, her for not telling, him for not being honest about his marriage, both of them for not using protection, you for wanting to be a tattle tale.  \n\nYou said she shut down and ignored friends when he was around.  This is a sign of possible abuse.  You do not know why they are no longer in contact; do you have proof that he is divorced now?  As he travels and they live in separate countries does he have a bed buddy in other countries.  Until you know all the facts keep your f-ing mouth shut.", "I\u2019m usually all about letting people know the truth and being transparent. In the case of another life being affected, a child - this is NOT your place. If it was so and so was unfaithful to so and so, I\u2019d say yes, all for it. But there is SO MUCH PAIN here that you do NOT get to dictate how Lisa goes through it. She thought she was barren only to have this surprise. She is working through so much the best she can and you want to rip her entire world open by going behind her back and not allowing her the time to figure out how to come forward? Everything comes out in the wash. \n\nYou will cause irreparable harm and damage and trauma to your friend AND this child. It needs to be Lisa\u2019s choice to come forward and she will do so when she\u2019s ready. It would be fair for you to say to Lisa that this is weighing on you and it\u2019s eating you alive with guilt - but you also need to remember you are the person choosing to remain in contact with Dan. YOU are the person choosing to put your nose into business that is not related to you other than being a supportive friend. \n\nYTA. And if you do this, frankly, an evil \u201cfriend\u201d.\n\nDoes Dan deserve to know? He does. That is not your responsibility. You can encourage Dan to reach out to Lisa. You can tell Lisa repeatedly that Dan deserves to know. It is NOT YOUR CHOICE to make that decision for either of them on how they come into that information because that choice belongs to Lisa.", "YWBTA.  This is not your decision.  This is not your child or your life.  You aren't in Lisa's head.  You weren't inside their relationship.\n\nHe lied to her and strung her along for years.  If he had loved her he would have been honest with her.\n\nThe fact is, you have two incompatible friendships here.  You're either Dan's friend, or Lisa's.  And really, you've already kept Lisa's secret for 'a couple years'.  You aren't really Dan's friend.  Either way, someone feels betrayed.  Your choice is one betrayal, or two.", "YWBTA. Loves her but lied to her for years? Nah uh. He can save it. 2) how is this your business?", "YWBTA Stay out of it, whether you think it\u2019s wrong or not. Your best bet would be to try to convince Lisa to open up. What if you told him and he ended up getting custody of Lisa\u2019s child and taking the child from her? Don\u2019t do it. You only know part of the story. I am not saying the child doesn\u2019t deserve to know the other parent but you are meddling in someone else\u2019s life without a full story. Lisa struggled with infertility. Be the good friend and help her work through this and let her do the right thing. What do you truly know about this man aside from what HE has told you?", "You don't know why she's keeping him out. I think if she's not telling him it's for good reason.

What makes you think you have a right to say anything??! Jeeze, poor Lisa having such a shitty friend like you.", "NTA\n\nI'm frankly surprised by the Y-T-A votes. Dan is a person, not some villain in a story you're watching in Disney+. He deserves to know he has a child, so he can be present in his life. Mothers don't have the legal or moral right to deny visitation rights to fathers, just because they don't want him around.", "Not your pig, not your farm.\n\nThat's between them and it should be when SHE is comfortable. Don't get involved.", "MYOB.\n\nYes, you would YTA if you unilaterally told Dan that Lisa had his child. \n\nAt best, tell Lisa that you have (always had) superficial contact with Dan via social media and both he and Lisa are very different people now. Tell Lisa that he occasionally asks how she is and you usually answer 'doing fine' but never any further (if you can honestly say that). Then drop it.\n\nIf she wants to get in contact with him, I'm sure she can. If he wants to take a trip to y'all's town I'm sure he can. None of that is, as Mary says, your business.\n\nYou can tell Lisa how you feel about all this but it would be a betrayal of your friendship with her to tell Dan what Lisa does not want to have him know.", "Are you 100% certain this child is Dan's? It doesn't seem clear cut & knowing that might mean you get Dan involved for him to find out she was also seeing someone else while seeing him?

And honestly, I would never trust OP with a secret again...obviously she is not a real best friend.", "YWBTA. Not your child, not your ex. Not your monkeys, not your circus. Does the situation suck? Yep but it\u2019s not something you need to be involved in. \n\nFWIW, I have the unique position of being the child in a different version of this story. I didn\u2019t find out about my bio dad until much, much, later in life and NO, I would NOT have wanted to find out from any of my mom\u2019s friends nor would I have wanted bio dad to find out from anyone else because it\u2019s NOT ANYONE ELSE\u2019S BUSINESS.", "YTA", "YTA I do think it\u2019s her decision to tell him if she wants.

In every single study, they have proven that children develop better with the information. \n\nNot knowing who your parents are eats away at children and your child probably won't stop until they find the answer. My mom was adopted and spent 30 years and 10s of thousands to find her birth mom. It's not about whether or not they find out, it's when.

Rather than telling him, make it a real romcom storyline and you can set up a meet cute where he can see the child, that presumably has his eyes, do some quick math and figure it out himself. \n\nJk Just encourage him to reach out to her. Is it possible there is more to the story than you know?", "Morally NTA\nThis is sucks cause your friend seems like she won't say anything then randomly will change her mind one day, then this dude will be on the hook for backed child support...I don't think that would be fair to him especially since he sounds like a good dude and would be an active dad if he knew but it will definitely cost you a friendship if not two", "NTA.\n\nI would do this is a way it's not traced back to you though.  If she finds out it was you it'll probably end the friendship.  But he deserves to know, and the kid deserves to have a father if he wants to be involved.", "A father has the right to know he has a child and the child doesn't deserve to feel like he's been abandoned.

According to his mistress, he told her they were separated, just not divorced (This is relevant). She was already fragile due to years of trying to conceive and not being able to. They tried everything and were about to do IVF when they split. It was a bad time for her, she tried to salvage her marriage but it was painfull for both parties. I and a mutual friend, M., were right by her side and supported her. Lisa cut a lot of friends of in the process, some because they were her ex friends also, some for other issues.\n\nShortly after she met a vey nice guy, D., and they dated for a few years. He is an independent professional and travels for months at a time so they kept things light between them. When things got serious he opened up and said he was married, separated from his wife just not divorced. She was livid and ended things. I frankly believed him. Lisa found out later she was pregnant. She was so afraid to loose the child she only opened up to me when she was 17 weeks along and told her family much later than that. \n\nShe didn't want to tell D. about the child. I was surprised, tried to understand why and was concerned that she was keeping this a secret just for fear of being rejected. then covid came along and we were all concerned about other things. Here's the thing, D. kept contact with me via social media and often asks about her. It's been a couple of years, he's divorced and wants to know how she is doing. I know he loved Lisa very much.

When things got serious he opened up and said he was married, separated from his wife just not divorced. She **was livid** and ended things. I frankly **believed** him.\n\nYou say you *believed* Dan that he was separated but not divorced, but you don't say that Lisa necessarily *disbelieved* him. She wouldn't have needed to *disbelieve* him to still be livid. He was dating her for multiple *years* while hiding the fact that he was still legally married to somebody else, knowing all the while that Lisa had been through massive trauma from being cheated on by her ex-husband. HE had every reason to know that Lisa might care about the fact that he was still married and might want to make her own properly informed decisions about whether to date someone who was still married to someone else, regardless of the fact that he was separated from his wife. If he thought Lisa would be okay with it, all he had to do was tell her and thereby confirm that with her. But instead he hid it from her, for *years*. It doesn't matter that they were keeping their dating \"light\"; even platonic friends normally get told whether you're legally married or not by the time you've known them for multiple *years.* He deliberately hid that information from Lisa to manipulate her into dating him when he should perfectly well have been able to figure out that she might not have agreed to date him if she had been informed.\n\nDan deprived Lisa of her right to make her own informed decisions about whether to date a married man or not. Lisa was livid because he manipulated her. You ridiculously decided that just because you *believed* him that he was separated, that somehow meant that Lisa should be fine with the fact that he deceived her - her, a cheating victim already, who he knew would be very sensitive about these issues - to manipulate her into dating him for years, when she never would have agreed to date him at all if he hadn't been selectively withholding information from her.\n\nCheating is a form of nonconsensual sexual behavior and thus a form of sexual abuse. And Dan, regardless of the fact that he may not have been *cheating on his wife* (since he and his wife at least supposedly no longer had any ongoing sexual or romantic relationship) was effectively manipulating and deceiving *Lisa* in the same way that Lisa's ex-husband had manipulated and deceived Lisa. Dan may not have betrayed *his wife*, but Dan absolutely betrayed *Lisa* by tricking *Lisa* into a dating relationship that he had every reason to know she would never have given informed consent to being in.\n\nLisa reacted by wanting to keep Dan out of her child's life, *because Lisa was abused by Dan.* Because tricking someone into a sexual situation that they never would have given informed consent to *is abuse*. Just as surely as physically forcing someone to have sex they don't consent to *is* *abuse*, so also knowingly tricking someone into a different sexual act than they consented to by stealth condom removal *is abuse*, and so also knowingly tricking someone into having sex with you when you know perfectly well they never would have consented to have sex with you at all if you weren't deceiving them about important details of your life *is abuse.*\n\nThe fact that Lisa was abused by Dan is a valid reason for Lisa to feel a need to protect her child from contact with Dan.\n\nThe child does have a right to know who his or her father is, *when the child is old enough to understand and navigate a relationship with an abuser.* And the child *will* be able to find out eventually who his or her father is, guaranteed, because 23 and Me and lots of other such services exist these days and are not that hard to use, so tracking down missing missing sperm donors is just never going to be difficult to do ever again. So the child is not being deprived of any such right.\n\nAs for Dan, he lost his right to know his child when he sexually abused the mother of his child by tricking her into sex that he had good reason to know she wouldn't have given informed consent to.\n\nAs for those of you who think this all needs to be settled in court by a judge, you're either ridiculously na\u00efve or else disingenuously *pretending* to be ridiculously na\u00efve about how the court system works and how often judges get abuse cases all wrong. If you are the guardian of a child, regardless of your gender, and you know from direct firsthand experience that the other biological parent of your child has a history of committing sexual abuse, *of course* you have the right to try to protect your child by trying to keep your abuser out of your child's life.\n\nYWBTA, hugely.", "Doesn\u2019t matter their relationship history (unless abusive or something).

And you're right - maybe Lisa does know some deep dark secret about Dan that she would need to at least manage.  \nNow if the OP had asked \"If I tell Lisa that I've been communicating with Dan, and all the things that he's said about that time, and encourage her to tell Dan, and she refuses, should I tell Dan?\" then the answer would be different - but the OP didn't ask that.", "\"Misandrist.\" Classic misogynist. By the way, I'm a guy. I absolutely will call you on your shit. You ARE a bigot, wanting to take away a woman's choice.", "Agree OP needs to talk to Lisa and bring up Dan and his situation first. But if Lisa only was with Dan at the time what paternity needs to be established? It's crystal clear, she even admitted to OP as much.\nAnd what amends could Dan make if Lisa cut him off entirely and blocks any discussion about  him?", "I literally said that *we don\u2019t know* what\u2019s going on. But Lisa does, which is why OP shouldn\u2019t take it upon herself to interfere.", "But she doesn't know. She has no idea what's going on at home. \n\nYou know who does know all of the facts? The person in the best position to make this decision? Lisa.", "Is an abusive father better than being raised by a single mom? And even if he wasn\u2019t abusive, they dated for YEARS before he told her he was still married. That should be disclosed early, not years into a relationship.", "I'm glad you find stories of abuse so entertaining. People like you are exactly why victims are afraid to come forward.", "Right guy from OP's own comments.", "What does that have to do with OP?", "Obviously, I disagree with you. As for why now - OP could answer that. My completely random guess is that it's been eating at her for years, and as the child grows older, and perhaps more cognizant of the fact that they don't have a father, she feels it's time to tell.", "Absolutely not. Mother does not have the right to deny father of his child, unless there is a criminal history, or an open cps case against him. Should mother tell him yes, but apparently she doesn't want to. I personally think she has issues from her previous marriage. Doesn't mean she should take it out on this guy.", "Friends come and go, so it's not something I am going to put my neck on the line for, no. Will I watch? Again, no. I will remove myself from the situation. Would a little hint slip out about something they might want to look into? Probably. But again, looking into something that's off is on them.", "So you're saying we should resort to grade school tattling instead of expecting everyone to act like adults and manage their own relationships? Sorry, but no. I am an adult, my friends are adults. They need to watch for their own red flags.", "Perhaps in your opinion, but for me, it's not wanting to be involved in other people's drama and not wanting to be the messenger that gets shot.", "That is a good idea, if both the talks with Lisa and Dan's reaching out are unfruitful, AND there is no red flag about Dan like abuse or such, then, OP, you can clue him in in good conscience.", "I agree with that. But I think as one of only 3 people holding the weight of this secret on their conscience, OP has the right to the conversation as to why it's necessary. And I don't mean specifics, but I have friends who could say nothing more than they're afraid of him and I'd feel confident they had valid reasons for that fear with no more information and a clear conscience keeping my mouth shut. But without even a hint of a valid reason beyond past trauma from another man, I'm not sure I would be okay keeping this secret myself.", "Multiple people's lives are already being blown up over this. I don't think you fully appreciate how important it is for men to see their children. It's like you don't really see men as emotional beings on the same level as women.", "No, you're biased because you seem to be okay with a man being denied his human rights. On top of that, you don't even realize what an extremist you are. When a woman says,\n\n>I'm hiding my child's existence from his father.\n\nthe correct reaction is *not*\n\n>Yeah, that sounds reasonable. I'd have to know a lot more to think otherwise.\n\nThat's so far from how you should be reacting to this, it's not even in the same galaxy.", ">Why is it her business?\n\nWhy is it your business to help someone crashed on the side of the road? You do it anyway, because it's the right thing to do.\n\n>Why does she have to \u201cprovide a good reason\u201d to a random friend\n\nBecause she's not providing a good reason to Dan or the state.", "It\u2019s not a \u201crandom\u201d friend. Did you read the post all the way through or did you read the title and immediately projected your own experiences on to it. This is a very close friend that she has kept through the most tumultuous time in her life. Someone who loves her and her child enough to hold her accountable. Even though I think she would be crossing the line telling him he\u2019s the father before discussing everything with Lisa first, I believe it would only make her the asshole for however long it would take for Lisa to process her emotions. It\u2019s ultimately what the child deserves to know.", "I guess I'm just prioritizing Dan's right as a father above Lisa's peace of mind. The way I see it, Lisa has done a horrible thing, and Dan needs to be told immediately to salvage his relationship with his child. This can't wait until Lisa decides to come around.", "Huh? Where does it say she told anyone Dan was the father? She just said she didn\u2019t want to contact him about the kid. Doesn\u2019t say that she told anyone why. \n\nMaybe Lisa hooked up with some random guy after she kicked Dan out of her life & doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s OP\u2019s business.\n\nNone of this makes sense to me. OP says she\u2019s Lisa\u2019s best friend but stays in contact with the guy who screwed her friend over like her ex husband did & now suddenly feels he deserves to know he has a kid. Some puzzle pieces are missing here.", "Lisa doesn't have the right to alienate her child from its father though. She has no basis for this whatsoever.\n\nYou're framing as if Lisa is right in doing so but she isn't at all. That's not how parental rights work.", "This shouldn't be a \"decision\". Mother's shouldn't get to decide if their father know if they have a child in this world.", "I don\u2019t think using someone as an example who was triggered by their own divorce is a good example.", "So you think because he lied (if not abusive) he and his child deserves not to know the truth?", "I think hypotheticals of abuse is grossly inappropriate when there isn\u2019t an indication of that. Infidelity is morally wrong but is not abuse.", "What abuse?  He lied about being separated from his wife.  Definitely an asshole move, but there isn't a single word about abuse from Dan.", "No... Lisa cut off her friends (for varying reasons) after her divorce. OP says Dan was a decent guy BUT that any mention of him makes Lisa shut down and isolate (herself) from her friends. He didn't do that.", "OP is in a position to save a man and a child from years of agony and regret, with little effort to herself. All it may cost her is the friendship of the person ruining the life of that man and child.", "How does OP, let alone anyone in these comments, know why the mother is making this choice? Perhaps something DID happen with father and OP doesn\u2019t know? Or didn\u2019t share? \n\nLiterally none of us know what\u2019s really going on in her mind, INCLUDING OP and therefore we cannot judge. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t think mother is right to withhold this information from father\u2014simply saying that it isn\u2019t friend\u2019s place. Moreover, I find it curious that OP is now in this situation when the kid has been alive for years.", "But way to dodge the question I asked you.", "I was the friend who said nothing because I deluded myself all I see is a weird friendship between her bf and a classmate, and not an affair. \n\nThe (who turned out to be) cheated on friend told me I should have opened my mouth as soon as I found things fishy, as she would have spared herself more years of heartache with that AH. (She was not mad at me though, as I genuinely thought my gut feeling is wrong and I'm misinterpreting things).", "Reducing everything that matters to other people to \"drama\" is a sure sign of arrested emotional development.", "What don't you understand ?  \nLisa refuses to involve Dan in the child's life.\n\n1) She's a selfish bitch. I'm sorry for the kid and for Dan.\n\n2) She has her reasons. Dan could be dangerous for the child and shouldn't be near him.\n\nProblem : OP doesn't know if we're in situation 1) or 2). So OP has to mind her own business and take no risks for the kid, or talk to Lisa.", "This is not my reaction.\n\n__My reaction :__ why ? I need to know more before judging the situation\n\n__Your reaction :__ what the hell, this is wrong, I'm going to inform the father, even though I know nothing about the situation, maybe I'll do something stupid but I don't care the father has to know\n\nI don't think I'm the extreme one between the two of us.", ">Maybe Lisa hooked up with some random guy after she kicked Dan out of her life & doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s OP\u2019s business.\n\nThen why isn't she in contact with the dad in that case?\n\nIt's very unlikely that she suddenly hooked up with someone else. Even if a child of two+ years WAS sprung on Dan, he would almost assuredly demand a paternity test to prove it.\n\nThe only thing that doesn't add up is OP's reaction to the whole thing, because yes, she should be supporting her friend over some rando. Lisa has every reason in the world to distrust Dan after her previous marriage fell apart in the same way Dan is now coming on to her with. Why OP stayed in contact with Dan is beyond me.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he's \"really divorced\" this time around. He lied. He lied then, he likely is lying now, he will continue to lie, and when push comes to shove he'd leave her the same way he's leaving his now-ex wife.", "Cheaters don't deserve kids.", "So let's say the guy actually was horribly abusive. Does she still not get to decide whether an abuser is in her child's life?

I\u2019m saying there are a ton of things that could be happening, reasons that Lisa may not want to share, and OP could be doing something far more harmful than she thinks because she simply doesn\u2019t have all the information that Lisa does.

I\u2019m saying that OP has no idea what really happened in that relationship or what kind of a person Dan is.
