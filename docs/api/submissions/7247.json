He had moments of course but they were pretty rare and infrequent. \n\nWell as of two months ago he decided he didn't want to be on medications anymore and went off them cold turkey. Since then there has not been a quiet moment in my household. Especially since he quit his job randomly last month after stating that since he is this \"brand new person\", he has realized he can't work for the company he was working for. He has been applying for different jobs but he ultimately decides that job isn't for him either after going for interviews because they \"ask too much for too little of pay\". Now I own my own business and work out of my house. I make more than enough to support of us both but I'm more or less pissed about the fact that I can't even hear myself think anymore and I've been falling behind with my own work.\n\nFor instance he will randomly start screaming out made up song lyrics, start doing the Donnie from Wild Thornberries yell, screech like a dinosaur or even just repeat something he found funny a million times over in the loudest voice possible while getting aggressively in to dancing (as in purposely knocking shit over while \"crumping\"). I can't fucking do it anymore. I've had a nonstop migraine for weeks. Even when he is playing video games he finds a reason to scream bloody murder. And I admittedly cannot fucking stand being in my own house anymore. I've begged him to tone it down, get back on his meds or even try natural remedies for all I care. Just do something! But nope, he refuses. States that he is comfortable with the way he is and I need to learn to accept that. I truly can't though. I can be sitting there in my office doing my order taking for my company and he will bust through the door screaming made up song lyrics. I'm never left alone. At all. And then after he's had his fun, he crashes and gets irritable. So today he is being over the top extra and has not stopped since the moment he woke up. I have so much shit to do today and he will not quit. He knows I'm getting irritated and he just laughs it off and repeats the same BS 10 minutes later.

I want to say first: both I and my husband have severe ADHD and are happily and healthily medicated. It is his right to live how he wants to live. But it is *your* right to realize that this isn't the person you fell in love with and you can't live with this \"brand new person\" anymore. You are effectively a prisoner in your home being subjected to random terrifying bursts of noise and violence (the breaking of things). \n\nPut him out and put him behind you. I know this is easier said than done and I am so sorry. But you are not obligated to spend your life being terrorized by a man who doesn't love you enough to care that he's hurting you. The problem isn't his ADHD or the medication, it's that he doesn't care that you're hurting. This relationship is over.", "NTA\n\nHe might be comfortable being the way he is, but you're not.\n\nThe man you got engaged to and moved in with was on regular medication. He made the choice to stop taking his medication, knowing that this would likely change his behavior. You don't like his new behavior. It's reasonable for you to re-evaluate your interest in being in a relationship with him given his choices.", "NtA\n\n\"This is the new me\" well if that's the case, then you can make the decision to kick him out whenever you wish to. Simple as that. You need your rest and if he can't accept that, then you need to find out if you're willing to keep this going.. With the \"new\" him", "WTF. Tell him that he has a choice: get back on his meds, or move out.\n\nStop financially supporting this person. They are taking advantage of you. This is so damn far from ok.\n\nNTA but your bf completely is.", "NTA. Not only is he interfering with your ability to earn a living in your own home, but he made an intentional decision to go off his meds and is thus responsible for the consequences of that action including rendering himself incompatible with pretty much anyone and becoming a complete financial burden on you. If the home is in your name only you may be better off being the only resident.", "NTA - honestly sounds like he\u2019s on somewhat of a downward spiral if he doesn\u2019t get his shit together soon. I understand not wanting to be on meds forever but going cold turkey usually isn\u2019t the best. Especially after that many years of taking them.\n\nThe ADHD is not his fault but it is his fault to neglect taking care of himself. This just is hurting the both of you both in your romantic relationship and professional relationship. Therapy at a minimum.", ">He immediately looked wounded and slammed out of the house. \n\nINFO: Have you considered calling a locksmith and getting the locks changed before he gets back?", "NTA, and let me be the one to go ahead and say that you might want to reconsider this relationship if he won't go back on his meds. Mental disability is no excuse for his behavior, and he's completely disrupting your life at this point and expecting you to just put up with it.", "ADHD is not a valid excuse to avoid working unless the case is very severe to where it interferes with a person\u2019s ability to work and/or completely hold down a job.\n\nThis does not sound like just ADHD. It sounds like you have a bigger problem on your hands. It also sounds like he is definitely screwing himself over by quitting his medication cold Turkey, and this is could seriously cause worse behavioral issues unless you confront this and demand that he goes back to his doctor to find out what can be done to stop this.\n\nNTA. And if he refuses to get help, I personally think a break up should be considered in the near future.", "NTA\n\nI hate to say it but he is causing a lot of havoc so he can have a med free vacation. I think you need to decide if you are willing to put up with this long term. He needs an ultimatum, especially if he has no job and is not contributing to the household but rather creating discord.", "NTA. If he doesn\u2019t want to be medicated that\u2019s fine and his decision but you don\u2019t have to just accept it and live with it. Decide NOW if you want this person for the rest of your life because they won\u2019t be changing without outside help.", "NTA  i think it's time for an ultimatum  if he wont go back on his meds you need to break up with him.  he isn't going to get better and it seems he is getting worse  he will never find a job and if he does wont keep it for long if he displays these behaviors at a workplace...do yourself a favor and move on from the relationship.", "NTA. Your husband is being wildly disrespectful. And that\u2019s with or without the medication. Objectively, being that disruptive 24/7 is unacceptable. So he needs to find a way to knock that shit off. Whether it be going back on his meds or spending time outside of the house, he doesn\u2019t get to hold your home hostage because he feels compelled to be disruptive from sun up to sun down.\n\nEdited to add: I\u2019m actually the partner with ADHD who loves to sing made up songs. There\u2019s a time and a place for that, and it isn\u2019t constantly all the time. I respect my husband\u2019s WFH hours, full stop.", "NTA.

It's inevitable.  Who you are today is not who you were a year ago.  Even without the added complication of going from medicated to unmedicated sometimes two people in a relationship grow and change in different ways to the point where the two people they are now aren't as compatible as the two people they were then.\n\nUnfortunately the sunk cost fallacy often keeps two people in a relationship long after it's over.\n\nYou have to ask yourself one important question: Does who you are now want to be in a relationship with who he is now?\n\nIf the answer is no then the answer to \n\n>I need to learn to accept that.\n\nis \"no.  I don't.\"", "NTA but... look I'm just an internet person with no training but this is really concerning.  I've been close to adults with severe ADHD (diagnosed, medicated, etc ) and I'd be concerned there's more going on here. \n\nNTA in any case, you can't live like this, much less get work done and you appear to be the only person concerned about actually paying the bills so you have to do what you have to do.", "NTA. However maybe it\u2019s not only his ADHD acting up. It sounds almost like he\u2019s having a hypo manic episode, which is phase of bipolar disorder. I would encourage him to get help. \n\nAs others have mentioned, this isn\u2019t the man you got engaged to, him being off his meds and in a downward spiral is impacting your lifestyle, and your health. Maybe worth considering if this is the future you eant", "NTA. If he will not/ can not tone it down, you are going to have to throw him out. \ufffc", "You were engaged to the \"old him\". Sounds like the \"new him\" isn't the life partner you want. NTA. But you should move on.", "Easy NTA.  It sucks, but if this is a life choice home boy is making and sticking with, it seems he's no longer compatible as a partner for you.  You can't force him to take the meds, and while I think you might have some good-faith responsibility if you want to keep him in your life to try to make him understand that this \"new him\" isn't compatible with you, you have no further obligation to make him live his life a certain way.  If he's happier screaming and carrying on, he is more than welcome to do that in his own space on his own time, but it seems likely that wouldn't involve you at all.\n\nI would suggest sitting him down and making it very clear in simple terms that the current arrangement is not acceptable for you, and if you're willing, telling him the future of the relationship rides on this.  Do please forgive me if I'm reading too much into it, but it very much seems like this version of him is not someone you want to marry.", "NTA.  Only a doctor can know for sure, but this sounds like bipolar is a possibility also.  He needs to get back on his meds and see a professional.  Good luck.", "NTA - but if you choose to remain in this relationship, you will have only yourself to blame for your discomfort.", "NTA\n\nMarinara flags here. Going off meds isn\u2019t acceptable. Period. \n\nI\u2019d cut my losses here.", "NTA -- As judged by one of 3 people in a 3 person household where EVERYONE has ADHD from moderate to debilitating.  \n\n\nADHD has nothing to do with empathy and the ability to respect your partner. His behaviors are causing you actual physical pain and risking your livelihood. A caring partner would not continue unnecessary behaviors that are physical, emotionally, and psychologically distressing their partner.   \n\n\nTruth be told, I think this is who your partner has always been. He has been letting his mask slip and has now dropped it entirely. Take serious assessment of your life right now. If he refused to improve a single thing (continues to be raucous at all times and remains unemployed) would you have gotten into this relationship in the beginning? Would you stay in this relationship if knowing this is your life from now on? He is clearly telling you that it will be, as he feels no desire to change despite knowing this is not working for you. If your discomfort is not motivation enough at this stage, be assured that it never will be.", "INFO\n\nWhy did he decide to go off the meds? Were they negatively impacting his health in any way?", "NTA. This is not the man you met, fell in love with and became engaged to. That man is gone. The person who has replaced him you find intolerable. \n\nYou have to decide whether you can continue a relationship with this new 'Christopher' and let him know your decision. It a tough call but the only thing that's fair on both of you.", "NTA. Tell him he's not allowed back in your home until he schedules an appointment with his PCP and gets some counseling if he decides to stay off the medication he needs to try other forms of behavior therapy. You are NOT financially responsible for him.", "NTA, unless you limit that departure to the one day. \n\nThis sounds like two months of hell, to me.\n\nSounds like Christopher needs either to get back on the meds, or maybe get a new diagnosis. I see his actions as ultimately completely selfish and over the top and out of control. \n\nI suggest you let him know your relationship has changed because of his behavior, and if he can't respect your need for privacy and space, he needs to live somewhere else.", ">But nope, he refuses. States that he is comfortable with the way he is and I need to learn to accept that.\n\nYeah hard no on this, you don't need to tolerate any of that  bullshit. Explain to him in very simple terms that you agreed to marry an Adult, not an unruly child. \n\nHe either needs to get back on the wagon or you're out. This will not get better unless he goes back to treating his condition. NTA.", "NTA, break up with him, who needs that. Ypull be supporting him and nursing him for life.", "NTA, and I say that as someone with ADHD. The real issue here isn't really ADHD or his (lack) of medication; it's that he doesn't care about how his behaviour is negatively impacting you and this relationship. He's well within his right to \"live free\" if that's what he wants to do, and you are well within your right to end this relationship if he doesn't get some help.", "NTA. If he's not working then you're footing all the bills, right? If your business suffers you both will.\n\nHonestly, my concern here is that he's quit his meds and his job in short succession, there could be other health issues in play. Not going to armchair diagnose but it might be worth talking to his friends and family (only if he is on good terms with them) and ask out if anything like this has happened before and how he can be supported through it.", "OMG, your post just gave me PTSD.  This is the first half hour to hour of every morning with my son (before his meds kick in).  This is the reason he needs his meds.  He has not outgrown his ADHD.  Without him going back on them or finding a natural alterative, this is what you will deal with every second of every day of your future together.  You are NTA for kicking him out, trust me, there's times when I'd like to run out of my house screaming before the meds start to work. \n\nYou really need to sit with him, calmly and tell him the truth, he needs to be medicated.  If he won't go back on them, then you need to think about where this relationship is going.\n\nGood luck to you.", "My dad is EXACTLY like this, even when medicated properly. I love him but I can only spend very limited amounts of time with him before I go crazy. I just want to yell \u201cwe can have silence!\u201d, because literally any second your not actively talking, he\u2019s making weird random noises to fill up the space, or saying something just for the sake of speaking. Drives me nuts. My dad is 61.\n\nOP, if your fianc\u00e9 won\u2019t get back on track managing his adhd, this will be your ENTIRE LIFE. I\u2019m not one to jump automatically just to \u201cbreak up\u201d like most of Reddit, but seriously reflect on if this is something you can put up with forever. Because if he\u2019s not willing to change, this will be forever for you.", "NTA.  Everybody else has said the things I wanted to say except I loved Donnie from the Wild Thornberries!  (I sure as hell couldn\u2019t live with that behavior unchecked in my house all day, every day, though).  Good luck to you, I\u2019m sorry somebody you love has become somebody so difficult to be around.", "NTA in any way. It's time to move on from this relationship, I fear.", "> he is comfortable with the way he is \n\nWell it\u2019s great that he likes the way he is, but that does not prevent his actions from affecting those around him. You do not *have* to accept being treated poorly. Mental illness does not allow him to treat others in his life like shit without consequence.", "NTA! He is not the man that you fall in love with, spent 6 years of your life and were planning a future. This is a stranger that makes your life miserable and puts your live hood in danger!\n\nUnfortunately this is how medications work. They do work when people take them. He decided against it. That was his choice. Now you have to make your choice, and the only one that will work out on a long term is to leave!\n\nHow long are you willing to put up with this? Supporting him indefinitely? Having constant migraines because he found his freedom? Even if he would decide to go back to his meds, you two continue this relationship and eventually have a child together. Then he goes off his meds\u2026 You will be in the exact situation with a child!\n\nDefinitely NTA, but staying would make you one to yourself\u2026", "NTA. It is over. This is not the person you started dating", "NTA, you don't need to learn to accept him like this. He changed who he is and you can't stand his new person. Without meds he's not the person you fell in love with. Break up and kick him out for good.", "NTA. Sorry but he is the one causing dysfunction in your life and he is doing it willingly and voluntarily. I understand not wanting to take meds your whole life (I have Bipolar Disorder and have been on and off meds  since I was 19). I know that if I stop taking my meds it will decrease the quality of my life and it will also impact and affect the people around me. If he feels the side effects are too much he can try different combinations, he can also do different types of therapy, try different practical methodologies (I\u2019ve been told doing puzzles, using LEGO and such are amazing for people with ADHD, for example). But if he wants to stay in your life he needs to take a proactive step towards balance. It\u2019s not about controlling his personality but rather him finding some happy medium where he can think, keep a job and not disturb his partner\u2019s living / mental health. He needs to accept that his mental health and functionality don\u2019t affect *just* him but also the people he cares about.", "NTA. I would reconsider the whole relationship.

I haven't taken meds since sophomore year in highschool I've learned to control it has never been an issue for 17 years.

Think of all the money you could be saving if he had a job and was an equal contributor; retirement, vacations, savings, emergency funds, etc. Of course support your partner through a job transition, but it's been two months and he seems fine not having a job, and you shouldn't be fine with that and the longer you wait to address it, the worse it well get. \n\nAnd now he is messing with your income, your health, and your happiness. He can act however he wants, but he doesn't get to do that at the expense of your mental health. So his being his true self is making you a miserable person, and therefore something needs to change. He has had two months off from work, and from reality. Now, he has to figure out how to exist with his partner, and be an adult again. \n\nStick to your guns here- no yelling while you are working, no barging in, when you say you want to be left alone, he leaves you alone- and he also needs to get a job and start contributing at the level he was before.

I had to learn the hard way that I don\u2019t get to control what he does and how he chooses to take care of himself. I just get to choose if I\u2019m willing to tolerate it or not and what my breaking point is.

And even if they do work they come with major side effects. I have adhd. I do take meds as I am not functional without them. However, I also have a gastro condition that requires me to eat constantly throughout the day. Adhd meds kill your appetite. If I dont eat all throughout the day I have flare ups that put me in the hospital.

Saying \u201cI cannot tolerate being distracted. If you can\u2019t figure out a way to change that, I will leave.\u201d sets the boundary without making the decision for him. Saying that is very different from saying \u201cmeds or move out\u201d. There are options and things he could do that would help with his adhd without taking meds.
