Simultaneously, she is praising your brother on the very same issue you were persecuted for.\n\nYou may have an extremely narcissistic mother. I recommend looking up the \"Golden Child Syndrome\" in the context of narcissistic parents (check out r/raisedbynarcissists). I think your brother may be that golden child.
