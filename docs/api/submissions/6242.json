You can tell him you\u2019ll help him if he comes up with an essay that is true to him and his experience, but that you\u2019d be guiding him falsely if you helped him with an essay that was more around trying to pretend to have an experience he does not. You can say many people try to make stuff up in those essays and that the people who will ultimately read his essays have read thousands of those things and sometimes can spot desperate appropriative attempts and plots to get in. You can also use this as an opportunity to talk about cheating in college and how disastrous that can be, to talk about queer experiences, marginalization, and why this idea offends you, to talk about standing in solidarity with groups that have historically and are currently being oppressed when not a part of those groups, etc. You can also share that at some colleges he may even end up working with or studying under someone who read his essay or have his essay come up again in other areas of his life (at my college they sent us a copy of our essays when we graduated as one of the essays was \u201cwhy this school?\u201d).

It is subjective to some degree (for example, I'd be happy to go my entire life and never read another essay about overcoming a sports injury. I read hundreds of those a year, so it's nearly impossible to stand out with one of those essays).\n\nIn general, I want to see a few things: can you write like a college student? Have you put some thought into the essay? Can you answer the prompt that you've selected on the Common App? Does your essay show me what you're adding to my school, what type of student you're going to be, what you value in some aspect of your life? Are you capable of critical reflection? \n\nNow obviously, as I said below, this is going to vary greatly from school to school. At a top-tier school with a less than 10% acceptance rate, the essay has to do a lot more work than it would at a school with an 80% acceptance rate because the top-tier schools accept so few students. If you're applying or just interested in what the heavy-hitter schools are looking for, check out Johns Hopkins Essays that Worked website.

It holds more than students think. Look--for the competitive schools, the general admissions requirements basically look the same for competitive applicants. If you're applying to Harvard and you're top of your class, you're not competing with an applicant with a 2.5 GPA, you're competing with other top applicants with the same GPA, same test scores (when they're there) and generally same activities. The essay is the place where we get to see what you're adding to my school, what type of student you're going to be & how your experiences have shaped you. It shows me if you're capable of writing like a college student and can show critical reflection. When I'm on a committee, I need something to tell you all apart, and the essay is it. \n\nRe: how much they count--that does vary between schools, of course.

Exposure to diversity in college helps students learn how to work well with all sorts of different people, recognize common threads to humanity that cross cultures, understand how cultural norms influence communication, see that their experiences are not everyone\u2019s experiences, learn to value different perspectives and life experiences, etc.\n\nOn critical mass, the basic idea is almost the inverse of the above; it's the idea that members of minority groups can often feel out of place and can struggle to assimilate and thrive in environments that lack a critical mass of similar people who can relate to their culture/norms/whatever else. \n\nA lot of colleges attempt to build a critical mass for a bunch of different subgroups in efforts to achieve exposure benefits for the student body at large while also helping members of those subgroups better assimilate and thrive.", "Ah, ok", "NTA but your poor BRO he\u2019s an 18 year old kid trying to make a move to college with a homophobe Mom that\u2019s telling him to use it to his advantage when that\u2019s messed up . \nIf I were you I\u2019d help HIM.", "NTA", "INFO: Who helped you with your applications and FAFSA?

Before the recent rise of Asian-Americans at Ivy League colleges, admission percentages had flatlined for years despite population growth in the demographic, and we also saw in that same period a steady rise in general college admissions for Asian-Americans, who now represent 30% of all college students.\n\nSo while Asian-American's may represent a higher percentage of ivy league college students than their proportion of the general population, they represent a lower proportion of ivy league college students than their proportion of college students, and at the same time they represent an over-sized part of two of the big factors in admission, SAT scores and mathematics achievement. \n\nThere's no smoking gun here, because ivy league schools intentionally obscure their admissions processes and make them subjective, often so they can discriminate without openly doing so. However an Asian-American student is more likely to be passed over for a less qualified white student when applying to an ivy-league university, so yes it is more difficult to get into an ivy-league college, as an Asian-American, based off meritocracy."]}
