Still misled, but could have something to do with it besides the \"WOKE\" crowd).\n\nHe needs to learn how to do these things himself, and to learn that cheats do not get far in life.\n\nI am so sorry you are going through this. This is just fucked up on so many levels.", "That is disgusting behavior on both of their parts. NTA.", "ESH. Family seems like pricks. Odd you think your brother may be gay yet also think it's just a ploy.\n\nYa ever thought about, I don't know, just talking to him and setting the parental drama aside?", "As if outing yourself is a surefire way to get into college, rather than that you wrote a stellar essay that included aspects of you as a person.\n\nIt was an insulting and demeaning request and you have every right to be angry and refuse to assist in this scheme.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Your response is cogent and very reserved considering that mom and brother have slapped you in the face.   IMO banishment is too good for both of them.  Happy New Year.", "Why say he's gay? Can't he just say he's black or something?", "I endorse this, sadly. \u201cHolistic\u201d admissions means that admissions officers all too often fall for a good sob story.", "Why would being gay or not have any impact on your ability to be admitted to a better college?", "Definitely NTA.

However, it's a tough thing to report/investigate now that I think about it.  Poor kid has no morals because your parents don't either.", "Life? No. Any formal process? Yes.", "Look at admissions. \n\nIt is much easier to get into college because of who your parents are than any other method.", "That's what I was wondering. Idk about other countries but mine doesn't care about race, gender, sexuality or any other characteristic when applying. The only exception is when you have extenuating circumstances like poverty, being a refugee, having a disability etc, and they're all things that can be proved easily", "A few years ago, I\u2019d definitely say yes, in present time? I don\u2019t think so anymore.", "True, except for financial aid.\n\nThen, with parental \"aid\", you'll be broke in no time!", "NTA I\u2019ve been on admissions committees and your mother and brother have a poor understanding of what ACs are looking for. As I tell people, it\u2019s not the sadness Olympics. I\u2019m looking for very specific things when I give an application a yes and that rarely has to do with simply the topic of a Common App essay. Being part of the LGBT community, having a disability, or a dead relative does not get you into a school alone\u2014especially given how competitive it is these past three years (honestly, if people only knew how many essays I read on these topics, our pool of applicants is enormous now). \n\nIf your brother is an active participant in this scheme you have two options: continue to ignore or if you want to go the malicious compliance route, edit a few commas, tell them it\u2019s edited and wish him luck. Chances are it\u2019s not getting past someone like me anyway.", "NTA at all", "NTA. After how they treated you over your sexuality, I would be mad too. Instated of writing about being gay, he should write about the difficulties of leaving with homophobic parents and how they wanted him to either lie or come out to get into the university. This would probably worth much more, that what ever essay he is trying to sell.", "BS", "NTA\n\nIf you want, you could talk to your brother privately and ask him what he is thinking. Explain to him that, contrary to your homophobic family\u2019s world view, you didn\u2019t get into college because you were gay, you got into college because you wrote a good and true essay. Ask him why he thinks you owe him help after the way the family has treated you AND his admitted lack of ethical boundaries and homophobia.", "NTA\n\nhowever, IF your brother is gay, this may be his first step in him trying to be who he is.\n\nany chance you can have that conversation with him and trust his answers?\n\nif he is not, then he is a big ah for pulling that.  people in minorities of any kind have enough problems without being used for kind of bs.", " NTA, shame on them!", "INFO: could your brother possibly be legitimately gay and terrified that your parents will treat him the way they did you? Sorry about your family. Sounds rough.", "NTA Stay out of this charade.", "NTA. But have you had any of these conversations one on one with your brother? Your mother sounds controlling, he may not actually be on board at all.

Good grief, your mother and your brother are such misguided liars!  Don't help them try to dupe a university, especially after your mother gave you so much grief when she discovered your sexuality in your essay.\n\n\"How I would love to help Brother with his dishonest, creepy essay; how I long to help him cheat his way to college admission; but alas, Mom, your behavior toward me around what your learned in my college essay was so vicious that the very thought of touching Bro's essay is triggering.  Bye.\"", "Brother is 18, a legal adult, with some life experience; he isn't 7 or 13. He is not too young to understand the implication of this lie. He knows what he is doing, and he knows it is wrong.", "I think what happened was this: OP wrote a compelling essay about her personal struggles (being a lesbian in a homophobic family). She was accepted because it was a good essay. Her brother, instead of writing an essay about his own struggles, decided to lie about being gay and basically copy his sister's story.", "I didn\u2019t read that like OP thought their brother was legitimately gay, but that she was giving space for the possibility (like any responsible person should, as no one can guess someone else\u2019s sexuality with 100% accuracy).", "Financial aid forms that requires your parents tax info to complete. \n\nLot's of parent's will deny the use of this info to control/influence their children.", "People fall for \"send us Apple gift cards or your electricity will be shut off in an hour\" stories, too - doesn't make it okay to do.", "Well, OP hasn't mastered the skill of manipulating people, so bro shouldn't ask for her help.", "Wow. I learn everyday that yes, people truly are terrible and freely admit it. Lie to get ahead is just sad and pathetic. \ud83d\ude1e", "Sounds like you live in very progressive country, come for a week in eastern Europe and you'll be singing differently", "Given the information in the post, we don't even know if the brother is in on what his mother is doing (\"she said both of them agreed\").
