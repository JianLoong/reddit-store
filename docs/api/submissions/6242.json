This is just fucked up on so many levels.", "That is disgusting behavior on both of their parts. NTA.", "ESH. Family seems like pricks. Odd you think your brother may be gay yet also think it's just a ploy.\n\nYa ever thought about, I don't know, just talking to him and setting the parental drama aside?", "As if outing yourself is a surefire way to get into college, rather than that you wrote a stellar essay that included aspects of you as a person.\n\nIt was an insulting and demeaning request and you have every right to be angry and refuse to assist in this scheme.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Your response is cogent and very reserved considering that mom and brother have slapped you in the face.   IMO banishment is too good for both of them.  Happy New Year.", "Why say he's gay? Can't he just say he's black or something?", "I endorse this, sadly. \u201cHolistic\u201d admissions means that admissions officers all too often fall for a good sob story.", "Why would being gay or not have any impact on your ability to be admitted to a better college?", "Definitely NTA.

You for thinking that anything is honest in college admissions. That's the real lesson of university. Learn to lie and your life can be a lot easier.", "NTA. He shouldn't be lying. Your parents shouldn't encourage (or suggest!) this.

However, it's a tough thing to report/investigate now that I think about it.  Poor kid has no morals because your parents don't either.", "Life? No. Any formal process? Yes.", "Look at admissions. \n\nIt is much easier to get into college because of who your parents are than any other method.", "That's what I was wondering. Idk about other countries but mine doesn't care about race, gender, sexuality or any other characteristic when applying. The only exception is when you have extenuating circumstances like poverty, being a refugee, having a disability etc, and they're all things that can be proved easily", "A few years ago, I\u2019d definitely say yes, in present time? I don\u2019t think so anymore.", "True, except for financial aid.\n\nThen, with parental \"aid\", you'll be broke in no time!"]}
