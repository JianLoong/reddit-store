I honestly do not know what it's correct name is and I thought this hopefully wouldn't offend.\n\nYesterday I (42m) took my daughter (6f), son (5m) and nephew (8m) to this large playground.  The bank of swings is huge.  There's 6 traditional swings of various heights, 4 of these stiff plank style swings with ropes instead of chains, 4 baby or toddler swings and 1 accessible swing for any child that needs it.\n\nWe're the only 4 here and after 20 mins of slides and running around on the climbing stuff the kids head to the swing area.  My two grab their choices and my nephew says \"what's this?\" asking about the accessible swing.  I explain this is an inclusive swing so all children have a chance to play. \"Oh ok, like kids in wheelchairs?\"  \"Exactly buddy.\"  He then asks if he could try it out.  I look back towards the parking lot, see nobody else is coming that would need this and say sure.  This could be where I messed up, not sure.\n\nNow if you haven't seen this swing it's similar to a large cradle with two shoulder style bars that clip by the crotch. Because it's anchored up high, this swing can really get you up there. 3 mins in and my nephew is having a blast when a handicap placard car pulls up and a young girl gets out with parents.  She has braces that support at her wrist and elbow for stability.  I won't speculate on what her disability is as it's not my business or relevant... but IMO my nephew now needs to vacate this swing. \n\nAs they're entering the play area, I tell him to hop off and pick another swing.  He quietly says No.  I tell him again and he gets down, goes and sits alone on a bench on the far side and literally pouts. After a few mins, I walk over to see what's up and he brushes me off and walks towards my car.  At this point, the young girl is having a blast on the swing BTW.\n\nAfter a quiet, pouty ride to my sister's house, I drop him off and am not even on the highway and she's already calling to yell that I was out of line and wrong and there's nothing wrong with the other little girl sitting and waiting for 15 mins until the swing opens up.\n\nI don't have the energy to debate this with her so I say, \"Yea... I just disagree but also don't feel like arguing\" so then she hangs up.\n\nMy attitude is my nephew can use 100% of this playground, that little girl cannot. Give her the swing ffs. Was I TA for stopping my nephew so she could use the swing?", "created_utc": 1690808270, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15efi6m/aita_for_removing_my_nephew_from_the_accessible/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The kid needs to learn.", "NTA\n\nIt's a valuable lesson for the kid to learn that he needs to share and accommodate others", "NTA\n\nThis is how its done. It's fine to use until someone else needs it.", "NTA. I agree with you. Your sister is wrong. One should go a little above and beyond and err on the side of caution to make sure the handicapped have the same access as everyone else.", "100% NTA.\n\nWow, someone who actually wants to teach a child that not everyone has access to things everyone else has sue to disabilities? I applaud you OP. Your nephew's mother was way out of line by yelling at you. The girl is handicapped, you told your nephew to move so she could get a chance to enjoy the playground like any other child could. You did right by telling him to move.", "NTA\n\nI was the disabled kid who, in the rare instance a playground actually had an accessible swing, it would always be taken by a group of two or three kids messing around on it and not using it as intended. I almost never got to use them. My mom would just have to gently swing me while supporting my back so i wouldn't fall. Not as fun as regular swinging which i can definitely say now that I can use a regular swing. Your nephew was upset, but at least he listened. Your sister is the A-hole here.", "very much NTA, i think you handled this perfectly every step of the way. \n\nsister sounds like more of a problem than the kid honestly, he tried saying no but then listend, he tried having a pout but didn\u2019t really kick off. sounds like the more time he gets with you, the better he will be in the long run.", "NTA, you were great and explained why and he understood, he was a typical child getting upset after being told no while he was having fun, your sister is horrible thinking she could've waited when there were several other swings for him to go on. Your sister should've had a talk with him but it sounds like your sister is selfish and no offence, human trash", "NTA. It sounds like you did everything just about right. Even then, sometimes it's hard to teach the little ones that they don't get everything they want.", "What would your sister say if she showed up to a playground and a bunch of adults were all of using the playground devices, leaving none for kids?\n\nNTA \n\nAnd maybe set this situation up with a bunch of older teens when you take nephew sometime with your sister along to see what opinion she takes. Will it still be 1st come 1st served, or will she TELL them to let the little kids have them because they are made for kids.", "NTA. You were bang on, in every way. Your nephew (and his mother) need to learn these things. You showed respect to others, and allowed the child to use the swing at the right time, but circumstances changed.  \n\n\nLet them both stew - he clearly needs a man in his life to teach him how to be a good human.", "NTA if he can't get out of it nicely when someone needs it then he doesn't get to use it.", "NTA. Your niblings are lucky to have you since it doesn't sound like they're going to learn ethics at home...", "NTA. At all. She\u2019s being the asshole.\n\nMy son has a physical disability and the lack of accessible playgrounds and playground equipment is so astounding that it makes me cry in sadness and scream in anger that he and other children and adults with disabilities cannot enjoy spaces like this. So, when we enter these spaces, it can make it really difficult if the only things he can use are being used. We have to jump through hoops and deal with barriers in literally every aspect of our lives because our society is widely inaccessible, exclusionary, and ableist. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to know who else may have disabilities that require specific swings, entry points, etc, so being cognizant of that fact is really important. Having those conversations and speaking about disabilities in a neutral way is also *incredibly* important to create a more inclusive world. Accessible equipment is meant to be for *everyone*, so all are welcome to use it, but, if someone else needs it more, one should make way for them. \n\nYou were in the right. 100%. \n\nFriendly reminder to all, that \u201chandicapped\u201d is also not an appropriate term, as it denotes a \u201clesser than\u201d ideology of disability. Accessible and disability are the preferred terms by many Disabled people.", "Your nephew WANTED to use that swing.\n\nThat girl NEEDED to use that swing.\n\nThat's an important distinction that any decent person should be able to recognize.

That little girl is why there is an accessible piece of equipment. Your nephew may have been sad, but it gives you a chance for a dialogue next time you see him. Tell sis she wasn't there and he needs to follow your rules when you are out together. If not, you won't be including him in any more family outings.", "NTA. Thank you for recognizing that she needed access to it without having to ask your nephew to vacate. (Wheelchair user myself and they didn\u2019t have these swings when I was young. That sounds like a wonderful opportunity!)", "NTA but his mom is. I have had to explain those swings to my 3 and 4 year old grandchildren. They were allowed to try them until needed by a child. They didn\u2019t pout when told they had to get off. Children can learn.", "NTA and thank you. FYI, \"accessible swing\" is indeed the correct term!", "I remember being around 9 or 10 complaining of having to walk a distance to get into the mall, from a parking spot well far away.  I remarked about the \"too many\" vacant accessible spots up front, to my Mother, who shut that down real quick.\n\n\"I thank God everyday for my healthy children and my heart breaks for the Mothers that do need those spots.  Don't ever let me hear anything like that again, please....\"\n\n\"Yes Mom.\"  Lol.\n\nThat was the last time I ever felt I should come before people needing accessible access in our lives. My nephew can be as pissed as he wants. Shrugs.", "Thank you for the last line to correct well-meaning, good-intentioned people.  Most people do not want to offend others, we just genuinely trip over our own word choices, trying to pick the best option.  I know I do, lol.", "Yes.  Her attitude was it's similar to the accessible stall in a bathroom.  You need to use the toilet but there are only two stalls.  One standard sized, one larger, accessible sized.  If no one is in the larger stall, it's OK to use it.  And her point was if a person needing that stall were to come into the bathroom, you wouldn't expect to kick out the other person out, mid bowel movement.\n\nWhile I agree on the principle of that logic, it's not the same thing at all.  She believes it's identical. I do not.", "Your mom taught you well. You're an empathetic person, and us disabled folks need more allies like that.", "Holy crap, your sister is an incredibly selfish person and I guess wants her son to be as well? You did nothing wrong, you are NTA in the slightest.", "NTA. Accessibility for all is pretty rare, I feel like. You let him try the swing out and he got to enjoy it for a few minutes. Then someone else came who can ONLY swing on that swing came. Your nephew has the ability (from what it sounds like) to use the other, traditional swings. This other little girl does not.\n\nYou did the right thing and hopefully your nephew will have learned something about inclusivity from this. Any behavior issues are clearly as a result of your sister's poor parenting.", "NTA and thank you!", "your sister is awful and you are obviously NTA", "NTA.  You were 100% correct in making him vacate the swing.  While no one else is in the park to use the swing, it's ok to use it.  Hell, I let my kids use it all of the time when they were little.  But as soon as a disabled child wants to use the swing, the non disabled child must vacate the swing immediately as it's not there for them.  Your sister is an AH.  Granted there are no rules, just common courtesy which I see your sister has none.", "NTA u did what any parent SHOULD do I can def tell where ur nephew gets his attitude from thou ur sister sounds like one of those parents that 1. Thinks her kid does no wrong and 2. Believes her child should ALWAYS come first no matter what regardless of how it will impact others I have a handicapable Brice who I love to death and I have been in SOOOO many situations over crap like this I can give u a few examples to share rig ur sister so maybe she can finally understand the impact it has in these kids! \n1. Once I took my son (who was four at the time) and niece who was 5 we\u2019ll call my son uhh thatcher and my niece Evie ok so me Evie and thatcher show up to the park thatcher wants Evie to do a few things with him that she just can not do so he suggested swinging it\u2019s a small area so only one swing for her and a kid abut 9 years old was in said said (completely able bodied kid) because as u said it can get higher while his mom stood there we walked over and sat at one of the picnic tables to wait after about 15 mins I walked over and asked the mom when she thought he kid would be done I pointed to my niece and said they would rly love to swing and this swing is her only safe option she said he\u2019d be done when he\u2019s done, I walked back and said we may have to coke back another time to which thatcher got upset i offers for us to get ice cream instead but thatch would have none of it evie tried to tell him to go play and she would wait but he wanted to oaky with her so badly s they r super close after another 20 mins I was about to pack the kids up as I was telling them it\u2019s time to go I saw how let down they were but they listened to me a took their trash to the cans (thatcher pushed Evie over so they could go together) while they did this I turned to the mom and said \u201cI know these swings r here for those kids who need them ur child has the ability to play with everything yet he takes the one thing she can use and instead of being a adult and becoming to him she needs it u teach him the works should bow down to him I worry for his future\u201d I did NOT realize at some light her husband had walked up and over heard us and he WENT OFF not in me on her and the kid he asked his son y he didn\u2019t get off when he heard someone needed it and he told his dad because he had it first and he doesn\u2019t have to share needless to say the dad was FURIOUS that not only did his wife allow Thai but that his kid had stayed on the swing just so Evie couldn\u2019t use it when he didn\u2019t even want to swing anymore he did it to be mean I went back over to Evie and thatcher and asked if they were ready to swing but at this pint Evie was so embarrassed (I tried to explain she had no reason to be but she felt like her disability got the boy in trouble) and she wanted to leave not only did ur nephew show extreme disrespect but he could have hurt her feeling and made her feel bad if u hadn\u2019t stepped in \n2. Evie (about 9 at this point) thatcher (8) and my daughter let\u2019s call her Riley (6) and I went to a park this park is small and doesn\u2019t have to awful much as it\u2019s by a lake but still has a swing that is Evie sage and even a merry go round type deal (I was shocked but pleased they had more inclusive stuff) and again an entitled kid and parent took the swing at this point there\u2019s been quite a few times I\u2019ve had to leave parks with the kids cuz someone took the only things Evie can use and u guess thatcher had enough Riley wanted to swing and she was preemie so she\u2019s very small and still uses the baby swing so we go over and this kid would t get off the swing at first the mom tells ya to wait out turn it\u2019s a public park and it\u2019s first come first served so I took them to the spinner and let them play but after a while Evie cousins do the spinner anymore so we went back by this point the moms trying to get the kid to leave cuz she wants to go home he had gotten off the swing but when he saw that her pushing Evie over he hopped back on which Evie starts to cry the non throws her hands up mutters something about kids who don\u2019t listen and \u201cr word slur\u201d who just cause drama which sets Evie off worse I wanted to pummel her face in but right now Evie needed my love more I DID NOT notice thatcher had walked away until I heard yelling I turn around to hear my son yell \u201cTHEN U WOULDNT HAVE RUNNED BACK WHEN GOU SQW HER COMING\u201d to which the kid replied well (r word slur) needs to learn that they are at the bottom of the pole at this point I witness my sweet 8 year old who\u2019s so full of love and compassion read back hit hand and nail this kid right in the nose while screaming \u201cDONT U EVER PIT MY COUSIN DOWN AGAIN\u201d I rub over and grab thatcher and tell him it IS NOT ok to hit the mom comes over screaming as if her precious child had just been beaten badly Evie start crying Riley hides under the slide crying it was a mess the mom calls the cops they show up Evie is crying and bright red at this point I calmly explain what happened and that I\u2019m beyond sorry for thatcher hitting and I would gladly pay if the childs nose is broken I would cover medical costs the police listen to my story then the mother tells them my son attacked hers out of no where and she basically said he jumped him and punched and kicked him multiple times which isn\u2019t true thatcher punched him once luckily there\u2019s cameras they pulls those watch the footage and charge the mother with obstructing a handicapped accessible areas I was hun smacked turned out the cop had a child with a similar condition and understood what had happened and apparently u arnt allows to block these areas from their truly needing them now grandees it\u2019s a slap on the wrist like a ticket depending on the severity of the problem but since that day Evie REFUSES to go to public parks or pools or anything else she says she is less then a human and only humans can use those places so u gave any idea how that feels \nWhat ur nephew did was just like telling that girl his fun is more important then hers and because she can ONLY use that swing she can either wait to have fun or go home because he\u2019s more important and his mother basically reaffirmed that what u did was what an adult SHOULD do if they see a child needing that swing and I\u2019m soooo glad u stood ur ground and honestly I would tell ur sister and nephew he can\u2019t go to the park with u anymore unless he can learn respect", "What you did was a 100% correct. Flip the script here on your sister. She said \"...there's nothing wrong with the other little girl sitting and waiting for 15 mins until the swing opens up.\" There is nothing wrong with having your nephew get off the swing and use another one. NTA at all.", "NTA\n\nThe accessible swing is meant for the children who might actually need it.

And you definitely used the appropriate language from what I\u2019ve read. We all make mistakes and faux pas statements after all - we are human.
