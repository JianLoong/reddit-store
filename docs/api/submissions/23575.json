{"id": 23575, "submission_id": "15efi6m", "title": "AITA for removing my nephew from the \"Accessible\" playground swing?", "selftext": "To start, I mean no offense by calling this playground swing the accessible swing.  I honestly do not know what it's correct name is and I thought this hopefully wouldn't offend.\n\nYesterday I (42m) took my daughter (6f), son (5m) and nephew (8m) to this large playground.  The bank of swings is huge.  There's 6 traditional swings of various heights, 4 of these stiff plank style swings with ropes instead of chains, 4 baby or toddler swings and 1 accessible swing for any child that needs it.\n\nWe're the only 4 here and after 20 mins of slides and running around on the climbing stuff the kids head to the swing area.  My two grab their choices and my nephew says \"what's this?\" asking about the accessible swing.  I explain this is an inclusive swing so all children have a chance to play. \"Oh ok, like kids in wheelchairs?\"  \"Exactly buddy.\"  He then asks if he could try it out.  I look back towards the parking lot, see nobody else is coming that would need this and say sure.  This could be where I messed up, not sure.\n\nNow if you haven't seen this swing it's similar to a large cradle with two shoulder style bars that clip by the crotch. Because it's anchored up high, this swing can really get you up there. 3 mins in and my nephew is having a blast when a handicap placard car pulls up and a young girl gets out with parents.  She has braces that support at her wrist and elbow for stability.  I won't speculate on what her disability is as it's not my business or relevant... but IMO my nephew now needs to vacate this swing. \n\nAs they're entering the play area, I tell him to hop off and pick another swing.  He quietly says No.  I tell him again and he gets down, goes and sits alone on a bench on the far side and literally pouts. After a few mins, I walk over to see what's up and he brushes me off and walks towards my car.  At this point, the young girl is having a blast on the swing BTW.\n\nAfter a quiet, pouty ride to my sister's house, I drop him off and am not even on the highway and she's already calling to yell that I was out of line and wrong and there's nothing wrong with the other little girl sitting and waiting for 15 mins until the swing opens up.\n\nI don't have the energy to debate this with her so I say, \"Yea... I just disagree but also don't feel like arguing\" so then she hangs up.\n\nMy attitude is my nephew can use 100% of this playground, that little girl cannot. Give her the swing ffs. Was I TA for stopping my nephew so she could use the swing?", "created_utc": 1690808270, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15efi6m/aita_for_removing_my_nephew_from_the_accessible/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The kid needs to learn.", "NTA\n\nIt's a valuable lesson for the kid to learn that he needs to share and accommodate others", "NTA\n\nThis is how its done. It's fine to use until someone else needs it.", "NTA. I agree with you. Your sister is wrong. One should go a little above and beyond and err on the side of caution to make sure the handicapped have the same access as everyone else.", "100% NTA.\n\nWow, someone who actually wants to teach a child that not everyone has access to things everyone else has sue to disabilities? I applaud you OP. Your nephew's mother was way out of line by yelling at you. The girl is handicapped, you told your nephew to move so she could get a chance to enjoy the playground like any other child could. You did right by telling him to move.", "NTA\n\nI was the disabled kid who, in the rare instance a playground actually had an accessible swing, it would always be taken by a group of two or three kids messing around on it and not using it as intended. I almost never got to use them. My mom would just have to gently swing me while supporting my back so i wouldn't fall. Not as fun as regular swinging which i can definitely say now that I can use a regular swing. Your nephew was upset, but at least he listened. Your sister is the A-hole here.", "very much NTA, i think you handled this perfectly every step of the way. \n\nsister sounds like more of a problem than the kid honestly, he tried saying no but then listend, he tried having a pout but didn\u2019t really kick off. sounds like the more time he gets with you, the better he will be in the long run.", "NTA, you were great and explained why and he understood, he was a typical child getting upset after being told no while he was having fun, your sister is horrible thinking she could've waited when there were several other swings for him to go on. Your sister should've had a talk with him but it sounds like your sister is selfish and no offence, human trash", "NTA. It sounds like you did everything just about right. Even then, sometimes it's hard to teach the little ones that they don't get everything they want.", "What would your sister say if she showed up to a playground and a bunch of adults were all of using the playground devices, leaving none for kids?\n\nNTA \n\nAnd maybe set this situation up with a bunch of older teens when you take nephew sometime with your sister along to see what opinion she takes. Will it still be 1st come 1st served, or will she TELL them to let the little kids have them because they are made for kids.", "NTA. You were bang on, in every way. Your nephew (and his mother) need to learn these things. You showed respect to others, and allowed the child to use the swing at the right time, but circumstances changed.  \n\n\nLet them both stew - he clearly needs a man in his life to teach him how to be a good human.", "NTA if he can't get out of it nicely when someone needs it then he doesn't get to use it.", "NTA. Your niblings are lucky to have you since it doesn't sound like they're going to learn ethics at home...", "NTA. At all. She\u2019s being the asshole.\n\nMy son has a physical disability and the lack of accessible playgrounds and playground equipment is astounding it makes me cry in sadness and scream in anger that he and other children and adults with disabilities cannot enjoy spaces like this. So, when we enter these spaces, it can make it really difficult if the only things he can use are being used. We have to jump through hoops and deal with barriers in literally every aspect of our lives because our society is widely inaccessible, exclusionary, and ableist. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to know who else may have disabilities that require specific swings, entry points, etc, so being cognizant of that fact is really important. Having those conversations and speaking about disabilities in a neutral way is also *incredibly* important to create a more inclusive world. Accessible equipment is meant to be for *everyone*, so all are welcome to use it, but, if someone else needs it more, one should make way for them. \n\nYou were in the right. 100%. \n\nFriendly reminder to all, that \u201chandicapped\u201d is also not an appropriate term, as it denotes a \u201clesser than\u201d ideology of disability. Accessible and disability are the preferred terms by many Disabled people.", "Your nephew WANTED to use that swing.\n\nThat girl NEEDED to use that swing.\n\nThat's an important distinction that any decent person should be able to recognize. You did and proceeded to teach that lesson to your nephew, did your part to try and help him grow to be a decent person.

That little girl is why there is an accessible piece of equipment. Your nephew may have been sad, but it gives you a chance for a dialogue next time you see him. Tell sis she wasn't there and he needs to follow your rules when you are out together. If not, you won't be including him in any more family outings.", "NTA. Thank you for recognizing that she needed access to it without having to ask your nephew to vacate. (Wheelchair user myself and they didn\u2019t have these swings when I was young. That sounds like a wonderful opportunity!)", "NTA but his mom is. I have had to explain those swings to my 3 and 4 year old grandchildren. They were allowed to try them until needed by a child. They didn\u2019t pout when told they had to get off. Children can learn.", "NTA and thank you. FYI, \"accessible swing\" is indeed the correct term!", "I remember being around 9 or 10 complaining of having to walk a distance to get into the mall, from a parking spot well far away.  I remarked about the \"too many\" vacant accessible spots up front, to my Mother, who shut that down real quick.\n\n\"I thank God everyday for my healthy children and my heart breaks for the Mothers that do need those spots.  Don't ever let me hear anything like that again, please....\"\n\n\"Yes Mom.\"  Lol.\n\nThat was the last time I ever felt I should come before people needing accessible access in our lives. My nephew can be as pissed as he wants. Shrugs.", "Thank you for the last line to correct well-meaning, good-intentioned people.  Most people do not want to offend others, we just genuinely trip over our own word choices, trying to pick the best option.  I know I do, lol.", "Yes.  Her attitude was it's similar to the accessible stall in a bathroom.  You need to use the toilet but there are only two stalls.  One standard sized, one larger, accessible sized.  If no one is in the larger stall, it's OK to use it.  And her point was if a person needing that stall were to come into the bathroom, you wouldn't expect to kick out the other person out, mid bowel movement.\n\nWhile I agree on the principle of that logic, it's not the same thing at all.  She believes it's identical. I do not.", "Your mom taught you well. You're an empathetic person, and us disabled folks need more allies like that."]}
