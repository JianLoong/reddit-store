He texted to ask me to fly out this weekend. I just finished a major project at work and am physically, mentally and emotionally burnt out so I suggested flying out early the following week. He got very insistent and when I asked him why he was so fixated, he told me that he was going to propose. \nWe have never talked about getting married. Neither of us have been married before and I take it seriously. It\u2019s a legal agreement! I have only ever wanted to get married if it felt right - I have seen so many of my friends struggle with the aftermath of bitter divorces. \n\nMy response was surprise. I told him that we had never talked about this, we haven\u2019t talked about our future, our finances, and the fact that I would become a stepmother in the process. My boyfriend became really upset. He said that I took something that was supposed to be romantic, magical, and celebratory and squashed it. That I turned a celebration of love into a business transaction. I told him that these things are important to me and it\u2019s just plain stupid not to discuss them. His response was that yes it is important but I could have waited for another time to discuss all of it. He says I ruined the moment and doesn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore. \n\nSo, what I\u2019d like to know is, aita for responding to a potential proposal the way I did?

You\u2019re very responsible and smart for wanting to figure out logistics first because it is a huge commitment. It\u2019s a bit concerning that he doesn\u2019t want to talk about these things especially before even buying the ring. It sounds like he\u2019s pushing you into it. I\u2019d keep an eye out and don\u2019t rush into anything.", "NTA. You and your boyfriend should have been on the same page, on this subject. It should have been discussed before. You are right to raise questions and concerns.", "NTA, a proposal is something that should be spoken about before hand. A proposal itself should be a surprise, but an engagement should not be, if that makes sense. You don't need to know when a proposal is going to happen, but it shouldn't blindside the person on the receiving end. You should both be on the same page about how this is the direction you want the relationship to be going", "NTA- a marriage IS a business transaction. And if it was that important to him he could have waited a few more days for you to come out and see him without pressuring you. He ruined the surprise by himself. And just from how you write you don\u2019t seem too thrilled by the idea of marrying him. This basically was a proposal and your gut instinct is already telling you no", " NTA. You\u2019re absolutely correct. I\u2019m all for whirlwind romances. My parents had one and my fianc\u00e9 and I had one. However, neither I nor my parents for engaged without discussing all of the things you listed and more. You and your fianc\u00e9 know that you\u2019re in love but that\u2019s not enough to sustain a marriage. You also have to be on the same page about the core issues that make or break the relationship. The fact that your bf doesn\u2019t understand that is a red flag.", "NTA He\u2019s just upset he couldn\u2019t railroad you into saying yes.  Of course these things should be discussed, him deciding he wants to get married and not ever having spoken about the possibility or the ramifications of being a stepmom etc is a major red flag for me.\n\nEven more so for doing it when he knew you\u2019d be tired and making you travel to his family for it. We\u2019re your friends and/or family notified/invited?", "Why someone would propose without discussing it first is wtf. What other things might he decide without your input?!? NTA", "You are completely justified.  NTA.", "NTA, and honestly his reaction of blaming you for \"ruining\" the gesture just because you're asking some very real and important questions is... troubling. Like, I get he might be disappointed, but the surliness is a little much. Does he have a history of reacting poorly when his plans go awry? Does he usually just need time to process that or is he gonna hold this above you forever?\n\nA year really isn't very long, and it's been up and down. I'm super glad you asked him to put the brakes on it until things have been clarified and you feel more sure. \n\nIf he keeps bugging you about it, point out fine, his reaction has sure soured *your* feelings about it, too!", "NAH\n\nYour bf had different expectations about proposing than you. That's fine, we all have our own vision of things.\n\nHowever, it seems communication is an issue in your relationship: the fact he decided to propose to you shows he didn't know some of your deep values about relationships. You two need to work on that.", "Your response is justified 1000%. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You shouldn\u2019t get married unless you\u2019re 100% sure. It sounds like you\u2019re not even 50% sure. You were already on the fence, his refusal to take your desires into consideration and to communicate is a huge deal breaker. You should break up.", "Nta at all - you've already thought of breaking up multiple times. \n\nI'm literally in the same place as you - we live together, we've been together a year, I'm going to be a stepmom.\n\nBUT\n\nMy fiance and I have 1) have had fights but never wanted to break up,  2) have discussed finances, 3) step-parenting responsibilities, 3) what kind of ring we want.\n\nI am sooo excited, so is he, and its still romantic as hell and I'm annoying everyone in my life with talking about our ring.\n\nThis is a sign. He is not the one for you.", "Oh, no way TA. He wasn't even in the middle of a proposal. He was talking about you flying to him for a proposal (IIUC). He's being a bit overly dramatic about his disappointment. Also, it's on him that he let the cat out of the bag and revealed his plan. That was a mistake. He could have kept quiet, and waited for another opportunity. So now he's blaming you for his mistake. He needs to grow up. You don't tell the girl she has to be somewhere because it's going to be a proposal! That's not magical.", "NTA The reason why he was so willing to just wander into marriage and you weren't, is because his life would improve and be less complicated, whereas yours won't. He will get assistance with parental duties, you will take on a share of parental duties. Ideally you would both get to share the household chores, but realistically you will likely take on the lion's share of those as well, so again, his life will get easier, yours will get harder. It's a lessening of responsibilities for him, an increase for you.  \nIt's very wise for you to have asked to talk about it first. There are many issues to be discussed. What his expectations are of you with regard to his children? How will it work? Where will you live? What if you and he have a child/children? So many things to consider.", "Congratulations on being a grown-up. Of COURSE you should discuss all these things, and more, before you decide you want to marry. I wish everyone did - there'd be far fewer divorces.\n\nRomance is nice, but marriage is about life. \n\nNTA. I wonder, though, if you and your bf can come to an understanding about this. You may be too far apart in your way of looking at the world.", "NTA, for a lot of reasons but specifically I want to point out it is a bad sign when a single parent wants to rush things romantically, and he is rushing things, because it's generally a sign they aren't taking their children's needs and SAFETY into account. A year and some change might be a great time to get engaged for some couples, but a single parent needs to be doing a lot of due diligence about the people they allow into their children's lives and about who they marry. Like the fact he didn't bother to discuss marriage and life plans with you before planning to propose to you when he has a child is a pretty big red flag. Think about if that kind of parent is the kind of person you want to be partnered with.", "NTA", "Thank you \ud83d\ude0c. I agree, moving forwards slowly with eyes open is a good plan.", "I reckon he'd set up all his family and friends to be there to pressure her into saying yes", "Sounds like it would be A-ok with you to not move forward though, which is fine - better than fine, it's important to examine and acknowledge your feelings, even if they're ambivalent.  \n\nA lot of people jump into marriage with intense infatuation and love and less thinking about mechanics, you sound like you're all about the latter and not at all sure about the former - you describe yourself as repeatedly thinking about bailing but sticking around for now.  \n\nDo both of you a favor and ***don't get married*** if you aren't absolutely thrilled with him and dedicated to a lifetime together, even if it means hurting him now, because it will be much worse when it fails later.  NAH.", "NTA. It\u2019s extremely concerning that he would want to propose when you\u2019ve never discussed marriage ESPECIALLY because there\u2019s a child involved! \n\nHe doesn\u2019t sound mature enough for a serious relationship tbh", "Oh 100% I didn\u2019t even think of that. Wow he was taking a big risk, either she says yes in front of everyone and then turns him down later in private, or she just straight up says no and it\u2019s just awful. In my mind you really should only propose to someone you are sure will say yes lol", "I second this.\n\nI remember thinking, on my wedding day, 'I've never been surer of anything in my life.' If you're not that sure, don't do it! (The marriage is wonderful, btw. 23 years and looking forward to many more.)", "NTA Also why couldn't the proposal happen at this weekend, not the following week? I wouldn't be surprised if it is just for some of his family. Maybe he even wanted to push you to marry you right away there. \n\nYou are just together for one year and already have problems. You already thought about leaving. And he just try to manipulate and guilt-trip you because you think about that marriage is more than the romantic gesture especially with a child in the mix. And another time to discuss it? When? When you are already married? \n\nYou already thought about leaving and know you see that you can't even talk about so important stuff. Is this really who you want to spend your life with? He has abusive tendicies in my eyes and you should be careful.", "Does He want a wife, or you to take up the duties of a stepmother?", "Yeah definitely a red flag he reacted to your pragmatism that way. Too soon to be taking such a step it seems, OP. If you see yourself with him long term, you should definitely discuss why he reacted that way, and why he would want to take such a step without ever even discussing the possibility before. That\u2019s really weird these days imo. You should always have had discussions on the topic before springing the question on someone imo.", "Exactly. I got engaged after 7 months and married 8 months later, but the engagement didn\u2019t happen until we had several deep discussions so we could each be comfortable that we shared the same basic values, attitude about having kids, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s 22 years later and marriage has had its usual day to day ups and downs (but mostly ups), and there has never been any major crisis caused by incompatibility on an important issue.", "The fact that he wants to do it in a place you need to fly to is concerning to me. You wouldn't have anyone there for you after one of the biggest moments of your life. It almost feels like he is forcing you to say yes otherwise you'd embarrass him in front of his family.\n\nEdit...NTA of course", "Nta but slowing down after having a whirlwind romance might be a bit bumpy but good luck!", "NTA. Also he took away the romance when he told you he wanted to propose that weekend. But its really something you need to discuss.", "Girl RUN. You are NTA but that a red flag response.\n\nProposals get to be romantic and magical AFTER they have been logical and thoughtful. All the things you mentioned wanting to discuss are super important to talk about before engagement. You guys have only been together a year and haven\u2019t had those conversations yet. He is absolutely jumping the gun here.\n\nHis negative reaction to your very reasonable response is sus and I would leave tbh"]}
