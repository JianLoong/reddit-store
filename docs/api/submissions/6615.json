From a daughter that grew up with divorced parents, on of which is an absolute AH, thank you for trying to be there for your daughter! \n\nEspecially as a teenager it can sometimes be very difficult to consolidate the immediate feelings (feeling left out my mom) and rational arguments (don\u2019t worry I have gifts waiting for you at home) and not letting the situation affect you in the present, even when you understand the rationale. \n\nHowever, I do think that you ended up in AH territory because your action of bringing all the gifts ended up with your daughter having more for Christmas than her siblings at her mom\u2019s place, which might have made them feel bad. I understand that the siblings are not your responsibility, but the children is the innocent ones in all of this. \n\nWhile I know the mom would probably also have called you an AH for this, I do not think you would have been the AH if you had brought 1 or 2 gifts to bring your daughter to an equal playing field with the siblings and having something to enjoy- an then get the rest of the gifts when returning home to you. \n\nMom is also an AH, because she is punishing her daughter for getting gifts from your family and clearly showing her. I am there is a BIG difference between getting a laptop or a puppy or a bag.

You had a great opportunity here to have an adult conversation with your daughter about wealth inequality, the economy, the choices people make, etc. Instead, you taught her that when someone upsets you, regardless of their reasoning, you get back at them \"with their own medicine.\" You didn't give her the chance to feel any type of way about the situation. I know it's awful to watch someone you love so much be sad, but you knew she was going to get gifts and all that when she was with you, so I think in that situation you should have allowed her the time to figure out how she wants to feel about it after talking to you when she called you. Now, isn't she going to be the odd kid left out when her cousins on your side are getting gifts and she already got all of hers, out of spite?", "ESH , I think i get what you were trying to do and the gesture would have been nice if not for the fact your daughter has to deal with the fallout.
