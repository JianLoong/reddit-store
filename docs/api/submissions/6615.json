From a daughter that grew up with divorced parents, on of which is an absolute AH, thank you for trying to be there for your daughter! \n\nEspecially as a teenager it can sometimes be very difficult to consolidate the immediate feelings (feeling left out my mom) and rational arguments (don\u2019t worry I have gifts waiting for you at home) and not letting the situation affect you in the present, even when you understand the rationale. \n\nHowever, I do think that you ended up in AH territory because your action of bringing all the gifts ended up with your daughter having more for Christmas than her siblings at her mom\u2019s place, which might have made them feel bad.

I know it's awful to watch someone you love so much be sad, but you knew she was going to get gifts and all that when she was with you, so I think in that situation you should have allowed her the time to figure out how she wants to feel about it after talking to you when she called you.

At minimum this is an ESH because mom chose to make her oldest feel less than instead of talking to all of her children about the realities of being a blended family and having different parents and families outside of the one in her home.", "OR the mom could have given her other kids their gifts NOT in front of their sister which was OPs plan all along.  \n\nMom messed up by having them open the better gifts in front of the half sister.", "No I think that's unreasonable to ask her to be understanding of.  \n\nA better solution is to get over herself and ask her ex if he can send over one or two of the nice gifts and she'll facetime the daughter opening them.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

That\u2019s how blended families work and mom is doing a disservice to all of her children by allowing them to build resentment for things out of their control. She\u2019s also ruining her own relationship with the 15 year old by making her feel unloved in her home.  It doesn\u2019t matter to that she will get more/other gifts at her dads house - mom should still make things equal between all of her children in her home.", "Aren\u2019t they your daughters 1/2 siblings? What\u2019s wrong with you? Why wouldn\u2019t you try to foster that bond? Why, because you\u2019re not with the mother? Good grief. \n\nI was going to say ESH but honestly, with this reply, YTA and I bet your daughter is on her way to being one as well.

She\u2019s old enough to understand the economic difference between the households.  \n\nESH (except the kids). You and your ex need to work on your co-parenting communication and strategies. \n\nYour ex definitely effed up by the obvious disparity in gifts. She should have talked about it with Daughter before gift time (managing expectations). \n\nYou didn\u2019t have to bring ALL the presents. You could have just brought one from you and still had the 2nd Christmas with your extended family. And, yes, the other kids (and their Christmas experience IN THEIR OWN HOME) is in no way your responsibility, THEY ARE STILL JUST KIDS!", "Or all the adults could teach their kids that gifts are just stuff. Adults need to help children put their \u201creality\u201d in to perspective. Is OP\u2019s daughter given love, respect & caring the other 364 days of the year?!? Does her mom provide for her health, happiness & well-being?!? Then she is a loved child... how many gifts she gets on 1 particular day does not mean anything. \n\nPeople seem to want to ignore the fact daughter was disappointed because she didn\u2019t get \u201ccool\u201d gifts... she did in fact have presents to open at mom\u2019s house. There were 3 kids in this house but OP decided to make this about himself. He dropped off a bunch of shit & let his 15 yr old deal with the consequences of his actions.", "You think it\u2019s unreasonable for a 15 yr old to understand she will be celebrating 2 separate days of receiving gifts & her 2 younger siblings are celebrating only 1 day. Really all that was needed here was a little bit of patience & kindness. Dad had an opportunity to help his daughter get through this \u201chorrible\u201d experience with some tender advice about giving & sharing. However, that did not work out. Instead, 3 kids had their holiday turned upside down by ridiculously immature adults.", "Are you under the impression that the child of divorced parents is privileged for having to split up the holidays in two days?", "The kid should be allowed to be with the family she feels best with she\u2019s not choosing sides. ops ex showed favoritism to her other kids to \u201ceven out\u201d the gift giving but she didn\u2019t even anything out op\u2019s family have nothing to do with ops ex family she\u2019s looking at it like daughter will get more stuff somewhere else so my kids will get more from me but then she\u2019s giving less to her own daughter. I mean ultimately the mom can give whatever it\u2019s a gift from her it\u2019s not a salary for equal work or something but trying to justify her favoritism is putting her daughter to the side .", "People absolutely do think that, and it's wild they consider it 'good'", "Lol... what?!?

(I suspect you are)\n\nBecause if you are, or if you know her, then she really is the jealous, petty AH who\u2019s actually responsible for ALL of this mess and if she/you can\u2019t see that, then YOU are \u2018delusional\u2019. \n\nOh, and I feel really sorry for not only the 15 year old, but also the other kids who are being used to \u2018teach\u2019 the 15 year old to be \u2018mature\u2019. Get over yourself! Kids are not weapons to get even. OP has been reactive to the pathetic, jealous, pitiful attempts at a power play and while it\u2019s not something I would necessarily have done OP is still not the AH. The mum is.", "OP hasn\u2019t done anything to be unfair to his kid, he\u2019s the one treating her right. He also never said he\u2019d be let down if she decided to continue seeing her. She may very well feel she has a responsibility to do that which is why I said they need to have a conversation, he wants to do right by his daughter whereas her mom isn\u2019t, she\u2019s focused on making things fair between the younger ones which is then making it unfair because she\u2019s treating them differently because her oldest daughter has another family to do that for her as well as her mom, that\u2019s not the kids fault and it\u2019s only gonna make the kid resent her. The only person parenting his daughter here is OP. \n\nGiving the kid a choice after having a conversation about the whole thing is the best option, you can\u2019t just decide what to do without having her input and what she wants, that\u2019s what\u2019s important here, what the kid wants", "Seriously I don\u2019t know who you are but your comments are truly pathetic. If you are not the AH mum, or a friend/relative of her then you absolutely are an AH-in-training", "So it\u2019s not harming her to know that her mom cares more for her siblings than her? And let\u2019s be honest - mom got them \u201ccool\u201d gifts because she knew the daughter would be getting better gifts from her fathers side. She deliberately set out to hurt her one child because she cared more about the other children.", "Yeah pull a fast one - she should have shared her thoughts/plan with OP that she was getting on he siblings more gifts to balance it out. \n\nIt\u2019s fairly likely the daughter would be upset by this. Had they spoken about it perhaps he could have dropped some presents there or something. \n\nThey do share a child, and the choices that impact said child should be made together.  \n\nSo yeah back to my original point, the mum is shit at co-parenting (and frankly just parenting) and this egg on her face is a direct consequence of her own actions.", "Dear lord.... good parenting is not about how much money you spend on your kids. Both Mom & Dad dropped the ball because they clearly can not communicate with each other like adults. People have an effed up idea of parenting... and Christmas. It\u2019s 1 damn day. People are not supposed to go broke trying to show how much they care about other people. Happiness is free. Love & caring also costs zero.", "I didn\u2019t say she had to go broke - but when you have multiple children - you make things equal (that doesn\u2019t mean they have the exact same money spent but it means you make things equal in other ways) if you love all of your children and don\u2019t want them to think you have a favorite you will find a way to make things work and leave no one child feeling left out.  It is not the 15 year olds fault their siblings father doesn\u2019t make as much money.  And we don\u2019t know if their father is in their lives or not so I can\u2019t make a call on that. But it isn\u2019t right for mom to punish one child because she has more paternal family than her siblings do, it wasn\u2019t on the daughter to choose what type of father/family her half siblings would have.", "Yeah then the ex wife should have just exchanged the younger kids\u2019 parents with the oldest daughter. It\u2019s fine right? After all it\u2019s not about how much money you spend"]}
