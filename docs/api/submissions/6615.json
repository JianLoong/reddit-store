From a daughter that grew up with divorced parents, on of which is an absolute AH, thank you for trying to be there for your daughter! \n\nEspecially as a teenager it can sometimes be very difficult to consolidate the immediate feelings (feeling left out my mom) and rational arguments (don\u2019t worry I have gifts waiting for you at home) and not letting the situation affect you in the present, even when you understand the rationale. \n\nHowever, I do think that you ended up in AH territory because your action of bringing all the gifts ended up with your daughter having more for Christmas than her siblings at her mom\u2019s place, which might have made them feel bad.

I am there is a BIG difference between getting a laptop or a puppy or a bag.

I know it's awful to watch someone you love so much be sad, but you knew she was going to get gifts and all that when she was with you, so I think in that situation you should have allowed her the time to figure out how she wants to feel about it after talking to you when she called you.

In fact if your ex wasn't trying to punish her for having you in her life, that shouldn't have caused any problems!", "That mom is going to be posting later wondering why her daughter is LC with her. NTA.", "NTA, she was doing exactly that to her own daughter already!! BUT your daughter is old enough to pick where she wants to be for the holidays, so I would have just told her that don't worry, I know it's mean of your mum to do but you will have lots when you come home to dad's. She is already turning her own daughter against her so you don't need to say anything to make her look bad. Talk to your daughter and find out how everyday life is with her 5050, does she get treated fairly during the week etc? Your daughter may not want to do 5050 soon enough. Make record of all of the ways her mother treats her unfairly for court (though as she is old enough to decide herself it shouldn't be a long process or issue.", "This right here, not only do I think you should be taking records of these situations, you should start asking your daughter if crap like this happens outside of it. Your ex actively punishing your kid for having a dad when her other kids don't, is a reason for you to seek primary custody", "I mean the only way you're going to be able to prevent this from happening next time is if you go to court to seek full custody. Because you wouldn't have even known about this until after Christmas if your kid hadn't contacted you. Your ex was doing this under the assumption that the only person who would know about it and be hurt was your kid. You can't really send her a message to rain in her behavior when her entire objective was to attack the kid when there was no adult to support her.\n\nThe fundamental problem here is that when your kid is not in your custody and is with her mother, she has no backup. You can't be driving across town to her house every time she puts your kid down. You need to seek primary custody if you want your kid to be in a stable environment where she isn't actively being punished because she still has you around", "Esh mum yes shouldn\u2019t be unfair with gifts but as you said is likely money reasons. So yes your daughter felt bad then doing what you did would be hard for the other children. What\u2019s needed here is better communication between the adults. You simply having a few gifts of yours at her mums for the day to balance things then her getting the rest privately would of fixed everything.", "Nta parents shouldn\u2019t exclude children over matters they can\u2019t control", "ESH.  Your already know why your ex is an asshole, but you just did the same thing to your daughter\u2019s siblings that your ex did to your daughter.", "NTA but it sounds like you need to communicate/coordinate this with your ex.\n\nYour ex sucks for excluding your daughter because she knows that you'll give better gifts.", "i mean. . . she is 15 and she WILL recieve other gift, she could endure the night", "Wow. It\u2019s a good thing your daughter is closer to 18 than not. The two of you clearly can\u2019t communicate or coparent in a healthy way. It\u2019s really sad because the people really suffering here are your daughter and her siblings who have to be a part of this fight. Merry Christmas to these kids. I\u2019m sure when they think back to this Christmas not one of them will remember the laptop, phone, or other gifts and will simply remember the fighting (that day and every day. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA but if this is a constant thing then maybe find a way to do holidays different so this isn\u2019t the memory your kid has of holidays", "NTA - Her mom honestly sounds exhausting, who singles out one of their own children just to be petty like that. I'm sure her mom is going to be very surprised when her daughter goes no contact with her later", "This made me lol\u2026 so sad, but true.", "Jesus, you are petty and retaliatory. You are going to raise a kid who will learn how to manipulate because of the stupid games you are playing with the ex. YTA big time.", "He did try to talk about it with her in private when he called her. She simply brushed his concerns and her daughter's feelings off. \n\nIt's easy to say the daughter should've just waited for her presents and enjoyed herself anyway, but this really isn't about the presents themselves. It fucking hurts to see your parent give such blatant preferential treatment to your siblings, especially when you're a kid.", "Then that is, again, a conversation for him to try to have properly again with the mother at a later date, preferably in person, while reassuring the daughter kindly in the present that he understands why she feels hurt. The stunt he pulled was childish and only escalated the situation, and puts the daughter directly in the middle of any further conflicts the parents have over it.", "Both TA. Mom is treating kids differently and you for showing up on mom's time to rub in her face you have more. Not sure how true this is, mom really didn't need to down the door. Both need to grow up. Poor kid, I bet she really manipulates you both.", "You can\u2019t control or offset what happens at the other parents house but you can be fair to the kids in your care. \nTerrible terrible take from a step-kid many times over. I\u2019ve had good step parents and awful ones. This offsetting gifts thing is something the latter would have done. \nGetting a few extra gifts from their other parent is one of the only things that divorced kids get in exchange for having two daily hands on parents vs the younger kids who have both of their parents living with them. \nI would have traded the extra presents in a New York minute if my parents could have just gotten along enough to not make us bounce from house to house every holiday trying to be \u2018fair\u2019 to the adults.", "Exactly", "You don't do gifts because some kids are spoiled as fuck? lol jesus you're fun", "Just because you disagree doesn't mean people don't understand that. Op didn't do anything wrong.", "The mom effectively ruined Christmas for her daughter, she was the one to escalate the situation. It's not childish to want your child to have some proper presents during the actual celebration. He's already shown a lot more grace than her by contacting her in the first place, there's no reason why he should continuously run after her for a conversation she's already shown she gives zero fucks about."]}
