Dad moved us to another state on the other side of the country after and remarried 2 years later. I don't like his wife. She tried to be a mom to both my brother and me. My brother considers her his mom. I do not. She tried super hard. But she fucked up things and was too pushy. She ruined some photos of mom by touching them with greasy hands and she lost a box of collectables I kept in my room that my mom and I collected together. The box was found weeks later. But she was always so upset that I was mad at her for those things. She's like that in general, loses a lot of stuff and ruins stuff when cooking or prepping food. But I found it incredibly disrespectful to not take more care of stuff that reminded me of mom. Add to that how pushy she was about being mom and how whiny she was when I would tell her I have a mom already. She also never apologized for losing/ruining the stuff. She just said she didn't mean to, which is not an apology and is not good enough.\n\nEver since dad married her she has been mom to my brother and he loves her, a lot. He does not like that I don't love her and that I don't want her to be my mom. He was 7 when he started saying really cruel things to me over it. A few times he said he wished I had died with mom because it would have been easier, other times he has told me he hates me and that I deserve to be alone forever, he told me he was glad I was upset over mom because I deserved to be upset. He also told me I was the worst brother ever and he wished he never had a brother. The wishing he never had a brother he has said to me more than 100 times. I lost count after a while but I did keep track for a while. I would try to explain the difference in our relationship with dad's wife but he would refuse to understand. He told me to love HIM enough to love and accept her, so he could have a real family. I once asked him to put himself in my shoes and how he would feel if dad's wife died, if dad remarried would the new woman be mom? Would he just stop missing her and put all his love into a new mom. My brother said it was different. He called me names. He told me he hated me.\n\nI am moving back to my home state after graduation. I have made my plans known to dad, his wife and my brother. My brother was upset when he heard I was going and I told him he should be glad because he can now have what he always wanted; to not have me as a brother. He wasn't happy though and then the other night he asked why I can't stay for him, why I need to move so far away. I told him he's not worth staying for. That all he ever does is wish me dead, away or say he hates me. I told him that's not worth sticking around for. He cried. For the first time since he was a toddler he cried. He told me I'm not supposed to be mean to him. Dad was furious too.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681892769, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rly7o/aita_for_telling_my_brother_hes_not_worth/", "score": 1052, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Given how often your brother has told you he wants you dead I wouldn't trust him near those belongings. He needs some serious therapy. \n\nYour Dad and stepmom are monsters", "NTA", "NTA, yeah he\u2019s young he\u2019s 13 but at 13 you know better than to say hurtful things and to be wishing death upon someone. You have every right to feel upset with his behavior and it\u2019s valid that you don\u2019t want to stick around to be verbally abused by your little brother. Does your dad know all the things he\u2019s said to you?", "NTA", "NTA \nDoubt your dad was furious when your brother was being so cruel.", "NTA , let's not ignore the fact that you are a child too when you had to swallow those hurtful words , he is still a child but so were you when you had barely anyone who understood your side , step mom seems very suspicious about loosing stuff constantly and stuff always involves around your bio mom .", "Okay, just for some perspective and a bit of devil\u2019s advocate, but I\u2019ll start with this:\n\nYour dad and step mom are absolutely assholes.\n\nThat said:\n\nYour brother was 3 when his mom died and he likely has no memory of her, aside from her being gone. I know it affected him because how could it not? A 3 year old losing his mom is going to have some serious abandonment issues, even though he wasn\u2019t abandoned. A 3 year old would struggle with the concept of abandonment. All he knows is \u201cmom is gone.\u201d\n\nChildren his age tend to lash out at those they feel it\u2019s \u201csafe\u201d to lash out against, especially those with abandonment issues. Your brother won\u2019t lash out against your step mom because deep down his biggest fear is losing another family member and she\u2019s most likely to leave. That\u2019s part of why they seem so connected, to an almost unhealthy degree. It is a similar scenario with your dad. I would bet anything the phrase \u201cdo you want her to leave us\u201d has come out of your dad\u2019s mouth at some point, and if it did your little brother took that to heart in a big, big way.\n\nBut he still has a **lot** of anger and resentment built up and he needed a safe target to direct that anger. Not just from losing his mom and having his life upended, but just the general rigors and hormonal insanity that is \u201cbeing a 13 year old boy.\u201d\n\nSo he lashes out at you. You are the \u201csafe target.\u201d You\u2019re the one in the home he thinks will never leave him, and it makes sense. You\u2019re younger and healthier, and being his brother he understands you *can\u2019t* just up and leave. Or at least you couldn\u2019t before. I don\u2019t think he ever considered that at age 18 you could leave the family.\n\nI highly doubt he\u2019s done much therapy, or if he did the goal was \u201caccept step mom,\u201d and not \u201cdeal with his grief and underlying issues regarding his mom\u2019s death.\u201d Your dad and step mom don\u2019t see an issue with his behavior because they aren\u2019t the targets. They don\u2019t think there is an underlying issue because they actually *benefit* from the underlying issue. Plus I guarantee their thoughts are \u201cbrothers fight,\u201d and \u201che\u2019s right you should accept step mom.\u201d\n\nAll of this is a round about way of saying your step mom and dad are absolutely, positively, unequivocally the assholes in this scenario. Your brother is the one acting out, but he *is a kid.* A small kid that had some serious mental distress that his dad and step mom basically used to their advantage. And now you leaving is going to absolutely shatter the kid\u2019s world again, because the person he viewed as \u201csafe\u201d is leaving him and has told him outright it\u2019s his fault.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would sit him down and apologize and tell him it\u2019s not totally his fault, but his behaviors towards you are too much to deal with. I know this would be hard and you have a lot of resentment towards your brother, but let\u2019s be real: he\u2019s 13. He is already at an age where everything feels intense and difficult.\n\nThen sit with mom and step dad and be absolutely clear that it is **their fault.** They pushed you away. They refused to deal with your brother a long fucking time ago. Your dad\u2019s job in the aftermath of your mom\u2019s death was to protect you and your brother and he *absolutely and utterly failed on both counts.* Now they have one son leaving them and another with serious abandonment issues that they never addressed but instead used to their advantage.\n\nSo if they want someone to blame, someone to be angry at, they can look in a mirror. They shouldn\u2019t blame your brother, and they sure as shit shouldn\u2019t blame you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA", "NTA.

If he is genuinely sorry and expresses his regret for hurting you, would you ever consider forgiving him? I only ask because your dad\u2019s lack of sensitivity to his children is what got you two into this antagonistic relationship to begin with.

Your dad really is an AH for allowing all this in the first place.", "NTA but\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s a LOT going on and a lot to unpack here. \n\nI think something is up with your stepmom. A lot of adult women have failed to have their neurodivergence properly assessed and diagnosed.  I\u2019m struggling all my life with ADHD and only in my 50\u2019s am I finally realizing what it is, now that the information is finally out there.  \n\nAnd knowing this and understanding how it has affected me and my relationships all my life is life changing. It\u2019s empowering to finally have the name for the \u201cdifference\u201d in me that\u2019s been tripping me up all my life. I am gathering the information I need to navigate this life better and connecting with others like me so I no longer see myself as someone who should retreat from life.  \n\nPart of why your stepmom has been so pushy may be tied up in self esteem issues from being the chronic screw-up who is always destroying things with her absent mindedness.  \n\nAnother Redditor informed me even as late as the 2000\u2019s girls weren\u2019t being evaluated for it like boys were.  So your stepmom could easily have fallen through the cracks.  \n\nSo, that possibility is something that should be lovingly brought up to her so she can get the help and support she needs to be better and do better for herself and her family and for you.  There are a LOT of associated emotional impulse control issues that accompany ADHD. \n\nIt can also play out as anxiousness and impulsiveness.  In my case, there\u2019s definitely an eagerness to connect to other people, but a devastating awkwardness in carrying that out.  And of course there are other forms of sensory processing disorders and other neurological or psychological issues she might have instead.  The point is, she should start opening her mind to the possibilities and opportunities to improve things for herself.  Even if she ends up not getting a diagnosis, she can learn hints that could still help her. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to grow up with that.  But I think if you can open your mind to accepting she\u2019s maybe not intentionally being an asshole to you, it will help you to heal in some way.  It\u2019s so much harder to let go of anger and move on when someone\u2019s troubles seem aimed at you in a way that is personal.  I have had my share of dealing with that with a mother who had trauma induced mental health issues.  \n\nYour dad should have gotten you and your brother grief counseling or therapy or something.  It should NEVER have been permitted for your brother to direct all of his pain onto you. Your dad and stepmom definitely failed you boys in this respect. \n\nOf course you\u2019re feeling the way you do and said what you said!  I\u2019m the mother of an 18-year old. I know good and well there\u2019s only so many stressors anyone, but especially a teenager, can put up with before letting loose exactly what they think of the b.s. raining down on them. \n\nEverything you\u2019re going through and your brother is going through and the issues your stepmother displays and your father\u2019s disengagement are all way beyond the scope of judging who is and isn\u2019t an asshole.\n\nYour whole family needs professional support to examine why things have reached this point and how to address it all properly.  \n\nGood luck.  I can\u2019t tell you what to feel or do or even judge you for any of it.  I can only wish you the very best for your life and give you my deepest condolences on the loss of your mother.", "There's seems to be a lot of more context needed for this situation, I'm leaning more into a soft ESH.\n\nThe biggest players that are the AHs in this case are your dad and stepmom for enabling this conflict. However, your stepmom trying to be a mother for you is only because she loves you, and it must really hurt to constantly be rejected by a kid she took on and treated as her own.\n\nIf your brother has been saying cruel things to you, it is their responsibility to nip that behavior in the bud and get your brother help for the underlying reasons he is lashing out. It's not on you, a teenager, to be an emotional punching bag for your younger brother.\n\nHowever, it does seem there's some mutual resentment between you and your brother. Your brother doesn't remember your mom and is finally happy he has a complete family. However, you don't want your mom's memory to be forgotten and you can't accept your stepmom trying to be a mother for you. Destroying your special mementos, the only thing you have left of your mom was not okay. There seems to be some conflict between you seeing him happy he has a family while he's cruel to his older brother, and him seeing you as trying to break up your family because he doesn't understand the hurt you feel.\n\nThese kinds of issues are incredibly complicated and the only way to really work through them is going to therapy and addressing the issues together as a family. Having a mutual respect for every person involved.\n\nThat being said, as you graduate and move out, I hope you are able to heal and honor yourself and the relationship you had with your mom.

To wish you dead?  No, OP, you are most definitely NTA here, on any level.  Move out, go back home, and you owe your brother nothing.  He may be young, but that doesn\u2019t excuse his behavior towards you, nor does it excuse your father and stepmother for allowing it.", "NTA - I think he always thought he would make you stay and finally love her if he behaves like that, bc you love him and want him to be happy and now he\u2019s shocked it backfired and he has to face the reality that he pushed you away more and more each time. Give him some space to grow and think about it, don\u2019t close the door entirely. Let it open in case that he sees what he did and comes around to accept that your feelings won\u2019t change and he has to decide to take that and accept it or to not have a brother at all. He\u2019s 13, maybe he won\u2019t come around in the near future, but don\u2019t give up on him. It\u2019s possible that it will take some more years, give him the time. \n\nAnd for your dad, maybe write him a letter about how he messed up, how she messed up and that all of that pushed you away and it maybe would have been possible for you to see her as a mom, but she f\u2018d it up big time with how she treated you and he and your brother did their fair share on top of that.

There\u2019s a lot going on here. Many layers of trauma and pain that need to be unraveled and looked at. Wishing you the very best OP!", "There's a lot of hate going on here, and it's not something Reddit can fix.  It's really too bad your father didn't get you all into therapy when your mom died or at least when he met his new wife.  If anyone is TA here it's him for not handling any of this correctly.", "NTA, so your brother at his age can continue to say hateful things to you but the one time you respond in kind your in trouble. Why is your brother so special. I\u2019m sorry you had to go through all this and I\u2019m sorry your father wasn\u2019t man enough to stick up for you or control his youngest son. I am happy you are about to leave all that hate behind. I hope you will be happy and can get in contact with old friends and other family who actually love and care for you unlike your father and brother.", "YTA,\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to like family, but you need to include them\u201d - Dalai lama", "Seconding this, with the whole safe target thing. But the thing is, younger siblings using older siblings in this way is hugely problematic, and it doesn't go away when they get older, the way it does with parents. \n\nCase in point, I have a 30 year old sibling that lashes out at me because I'm a \"safe target\" because no one explained to her that I don't owe her all the things a parent does, and she's clearly not picking it up on her own. Even at this age, I can't make her see me as an adult with my own agency. She just sees me as a horrible sibling because I refuse to make myself wholly uncomfortable for her. \n\nAll this to say, OP's problems with his brother are not going to go away anytime soon. It is unlikely to just resolve with age. The kid needs therapy.", "This is such a well rounded explanation and I agree with what you're saying but OP is a child that lost their mother too. I dont think he needs to apologize because he has been essentially bullied by his younger brother for most of his life. His brother may be a child and not completely accountable for all his actions but it doesn't erase all the hurt OP went through.", "I doubt the kid will accept that to be honest, I know it's mostly not his fault but that lack of empathy borders on malice to me. I just got so angry reading this post and don't even know why.", "I would just modify the talk with his brother to add that he's old enough now to understand that saying those things is hurtful and that when/if he's ready to apologize for it and truly try to understand and respect OP's point of view, even if he never agrees with it, that the door is open for both of them to try and build a new relationship.", "This all the way. All this post is hurting children and messy adults. I hope OP and the brother can heal. NTA but please OP fix this, losing your mother was bad enough. All your brother sees is that he could never have the family he wanted so much and now you would be leaving him too. Talk to him.", "This is the one.  NTA", "This is such an excellent post.\n\nDad and stepmom really failed here, there should have been therapy, respect for OP's mother's belongings, and acceptance that OP would not see stepmom as mom.  And they absolutely should not have let it get to the point where these siblings are saying such hurtful things to each other.  I hope as they grow up they're able to repair the relationship, or at very least understand the other's feelings a little better.", "I don't resent my brother for forgetting mom. If I resent him it's because of what he has said to me for the last 8 years. Dad knows what my brother does but doesn't care.", "And cut your step mom some slack - step parenting sucks - and you dont make it easier.  Your dad moved on.. you dont have to accept her as mom, but respect the role she played in your brothers life.. and yours.", "I mean, his brother should know why OP wouldn't wanna be around him.", "It\u2019s not immature to refuse to take the abuse anymore.", "Nope. It is not the oldest siblings job to do any of that. Sounds like you think every eldest child should be a doormat.", "Why should he spare his brother's feelings after the brother has told him, for YEARS, that his life would be better if he were dead? Like yeah he's a 13 year old kid but these are the consequences of behaving like that", "NTA 100%, I\u2019m honestly having a really hard time believing she lost the collectibles in the box. A box full of sentimental items that never leaves a specific room and is generally only opened by one person seems like a hard thing to lose.

The brother was 3 when he lost his mom, and the father clearly didn\u2019t help either of them process the grief or trauma of losing their mom. \n\nNo it isn\u2019t okay for the brother to treat OP the way he has, but hurt people hurt people. And it is more than a little obvious that he is acting out, and following dad and stepmom\u2019s example of treatment toward OP.", "I think there\u2019s a difference in what you\u2019re describing and lashing out at a safe target.\n\nLashing out at a safe target is when a preteen yells \u201cI hate you\u201d at their mom for not letting them do something stupid. They don\u2019t mean it, but they are feeling too many things and they don\u2019t necessarily understand what those things are, and it all comes pouring out in a really hurtful way.\n\nA 30-year-old isn\u2019t being flooded with hormones and doesn\u2019t lack the maturity to understand her own emotions. Your sister sounds spoiled/entitled, and possibly like she\u2019s always been the golden child.\n\n(There are, of course, some extreme abuse/neglect/parentificarion scenarios where an adult may have trauma and not be as emotionally mature as others their age. But in those cases the lashing out isn\u2019t going to be the only or primary dysfunction in their relationships.)", "TO me that is because he is viewing the issue as your dislike for his wife. In that viewpoint, his issue view is likely that the brother was only saying things to help you get to a better place with his wife and probably drowned out the rest as minor.  \n\nGuarantee you he wasn't viewing this under any circumstances from how you feel. This was all about him wanting you to like/respect his wife and do what he says.", "Respect her role in letting his younger brother abuse him?\n\nWhat a good boat steadier you are...", "How are you going to magically curtail it? Dad says stop and it magically stops.", "Abuse is a strong word to describe a child lashing out.", "It isn\u2019t about jobs. It\u2019s the older siblings responsibility to be more mature as a minor because they are in fact more mature.\n\nThere is a significant age difference here. One that won\u2019t be significant in two decades. But one that is major here.", "He\u2019s a child and so is OP and the fault lies with the parents here. OP is old enough to realize that and give a more neutral response that\u2019s less scarring. They do not need to add anything warmer or promise anything they don\u2019t intend to give. OP should absolutely get out of that house and move somewhere else where they can be happy. They don\u2019t even owe the brother any contact after that. But it\u2019s so easy just to say it\u2019s about doing what\u2019s right for OP rather than putting so much blame on a 13y/o when the parent and stepparent at the real assholes.", "I mean\u2026.. my 75 year old mother lashes out at safe targets, it\u2019s not just for teens. And the person whose comment you replied to has probably been experiencing this lashing-out since they and their sister were preteens. Family dynamics are often indelible.", "It would be easier for me than staying in touch right now. Too much harm has been done to the relationship and I feel done.", "...yes? I expect that when dad is present when one sibling is telling another one that they wish they were dead to be addressed. Ignoring it is not the correct action.\n\nAre you seriously making the argument that children should not be told it's not nice to wish death on their siblings when you witness them doing it?\n\nI'm so confused as to why a child that was never told what they were doing is wrong keep doing it! Why oh why are they \"lashing out?!\" I'm perplexed!\n\nWhen I was younger I used language that was hurtful. My parents sat me down and explained why what I was doing could hurt other people. And I fucking stopped. That's how parenting works.", "The older sibling has already been mature by taking it on the chin for 8 years. The younger sibling is now mature enough to know what he's doing is wrong. The fact that he doesn't is because he was raised badly, but that is not OP's fault.\n\nIt is 100% not the elder sibling's job to correct parenting mistakes in the younger. It is 100% not their job to tolerate abuse from younger siblings. \n\nI am an eldest sibling and I know from experience that what you are advocating in this situation will lead to OP becoming a doormat. OP should just leave and save himself.", "So many mentions of objects ruined by dirty hands... Does she ever wash her hands? Like,once or twice, it happens, but repeatedly? That's gross!", "Just another example that your father and stepmother need therapy and parenting classes. The idea of bullying children into a happier family dynamic would be laughable if it wasn\u2019t tragic. Just remember that your brother is also a victim here even if he\u2019s shown it by being an AH to you.", "Wow. That backfired hard!", "As an older sister here, don't let people tell you have to take it because you are older. \n\nOne day you'll really be older and an adult, and you will see someone who is 12/13/17, see how young they are, how much they have left to learn and remember what everyone expected of you at that age, and how old and responsible for everything you felt... And if you are like me, you'll get retroactively furious at the injustice of what was asked of you by adults and have to work a lot in therapy to let it go.\n\nI've given my sisters second/third/fourth chances I wouldn't have given anyone else because I know they were young too, and it was definitely worth it.\n\nDo whatever you need to do to take care of you and get better. \n\nIf you need to cut contact for a while do it guilt free. When and if you are ready you can reach out and open a door to see if your brother grew up and is willing to apologize and listen, and then you can start over.\n\nTry to forgive him eventually either way (I strongly recommend therapy to deal with everything you've been through), even if you don't tell him. It's true that letting go of the anger and hurt sets you free.\nAnd forgiving doesn't mean having a relationship with that person, just to be clear.", "She will often do other stuff while she's cooking and not wash her hands in between. It is gross and she has left marks on lots of stuff because of this.", "My dad did this. Now I was 18 so the outcome was a bit different. My parents were separated for a large portion of my childhood and my dad only moved back after my mom got diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. I will also state that I have ADHD/Executive Dysfunction and have issues understanding people's motives sometimes so that doesn't help. \n\nHe started dating a woman secretly within a year or so. He hid her from my sisters and I for quite awhile and then when she was brought around he took the position that they had been together and we needed to accept it. We put up with it and invited her to events and she was just a nasty woman who did stupid shit with my mom's belongings and things that I had. Like threw out my great grandma's hand carved trash can from Indiana that they made on their farm. It was my mom's side and nasty girlfriend (we later discovered wife. my dad never told us). \n\nBasically is has boiled down over the years to my dad coming solo because nasty wife doesn't like us and thinks we are out to get her. At this point she is invited for my dad but family events are the only time I really see or speak to him. We don't text or talk on the phone often. Basically its Low/Limited contact. Every now and again he starts in on the \"why are you made at me\" crap and my response at this point to him is that if he doesn't know by now why I feel the way I do, he never will and to just leave it alone because the only outcome that will result if  he pushes it will be NO CONTACT.", "Nah the brother lacks any sort of accountability and empathy from the way he talks to OP it's so obvious, It's not completely his fault but the \"you are not supposed to be mean to me \" after all those years of shit? Nah I would have cut him off right there personally.", "Understand consequences for our actions is probably most of the most important things to understand.

He has behaved badly but I would cut him a lot of slack.", "Cause his brother has repeatedly told him he doesn't like it, and every time instead of listening at least a little bit, he doubles down knowing full well how he is making his northern feel. He just didn't care cause there were no consequences before."]}
