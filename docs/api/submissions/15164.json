Dad moved us to another state on the other side of the country after and remarried 2 years later. I don't like his wife. She tried to be a mom to both my brother and me. My brother considers her his mom. I do not. She tried super hard. But she fucked up things and was too pushy. She ruined some photos of mom by touching them with greasy hands and she lost a box of collectables I kept in my room that my mom and I collected together. The box was found weeks later. But she was always so upset that I was mad at her for those things. She's like that in general, loses a lot of stuff and ruins stuff when cooking or prepping food. But I found it incredibly disrespectful to not take more care of stuff that reminded me of mom. Add to that how pushy she was about being mom and how whiny she was when I would tell her I have a mom already. She also never apologized for losing/ruining the stuff. She just said she didn't mean to, which is not an apology and is not good enough.\n\nEver since dad married her she has been mom to my brother and he loves her, a lot. He does not like that I don't love her and that I don't want her to be my mom. He was 7 when he started saying really cruel things to me over it. A few times he said he wished I had died with mom because it would have been easier, other times he has told me he hates me and that I deserve to be alone forever, he told me he was glad I was upset over mom because I deserved to be upset. He also told me I was the worst brother ever and he wished he never had a brother. The wishing he never had a brother he has said to me more than 100 times. I lost count after a while but I did keep track for a while. I would try to explain the difference in our relationship with dad's wife but he would refuse to understand. He told me to love HIM enough to love and accept her, so he could have a real family. I once asked him to put himself in my shoes and how he would feel if dad's wife died, if dad remarried would the new woman be mom? Would he just stop missing her and put all his love into a new mom. My brother said it was different. He called me names. He told me he hated me.\n\nI am moving back to my home state after graduation. I have made my plans known to dad, his wife and my brother. My brother was upset when he heard I was going and I told him he should be glad because he can now have what he always wanted; to not have me as a brother. He wasn't happy though and then the other night he asked why I can't stay for him, why I need to move so far away. I told him he's not worth staying for. That all he ever does is wish me dead, away or say he hates me. I told him that's not worth sticking around for. He cried. For the first time since he was a toddler he cried. He told me I'm not supposed to be mean to him. Dad was furious too.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681892769, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rly7o/aita_for_telling_my_brother_hes_not_worth/", "score": 630, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Given how often your brother has told you he wants you dead I wouldn't trust him near those belongings. He needs some serious therapy. \n\nYour Dad and stepmom are monsters", "NTA", "NTA, yeah he\u2019s young he\u2019s 13 but at 13 you know better than to say hurtful things and to be wishing death upon someone. You have every right to feel upset with his behavior and it\u2019s valid that you don\u2019t want to stick around to be verbally abused by your little brother. Does your dad know all the things he\u2019s said to you?", "NTA", "NTA \nDoubt your dad was furious when your brother was being so cruel.", "NTA , let's not ignore the fact that you are a child too when you had to swallow those hurtful words , he is still a child but so were you when you had barely anyone who understood your side , step mom seems very suspicious about loosing stuff constantly and stuff always involves around your bio mom .", "Okay, just for some perspective and a bit of devil\u2019s advocate, but I\u2019ll start with this:\n\nYour dad and step mom are absolutely assholes.\n\nThat said:\n\nYour brother was 3 when his mom died and he likely has no memory of her, aside from her being gone. I know it affected him because how could it not? A 3 year old losing his mom is going to have some serious abandonment issues, even though he wasn\u2019t abandoned. A 3 year old would struggle with the concept of abandonment. All he knows is \u201cmom is gone.\u201d\n\nChildren his age tend to lash out at those they feel it\u2019s \u201csafe\u201d to lash out against, especially those with abandonment issues. Your brother won\u2019t lash out against your step mom because deep down his biggest fear is losing another family member and she\u2019s most likely to leave. That\u2019s part of why they seem so connected, to an almost unhealthy degree. It is a similar scenario with your dad. I would bet anything the phrase \u201cdo you want her to leave us\u201d has come out of your dad\u2019s mouth at some point, and if it did your little brother took that to heart in a big, big way.\n\nBut he still has a **lot** of anger and resentment built up and he needed a safe target to direct that anger. Not just from losing his mom and having his life upended, but just the general rigors and hormonal insanity that is \u201cbeing a 13 year old boy.\u201d\n\nSo he lashes out at you. You are the \u201csafe target.\u201d You\u2019re the one in the home he thinks will never leave him, and it makes sense. You\u2019re younger and healthier, and being his brother he understands you *can\u2019t* just up and leave. Or at least you couldn\u2019t before. I don\u2019t think he ever considered that at age 18 you could leave the family.\n\nI highly doubt he\u2019s done much therapy, or if he did the goal was \u201caccept step mom,\u201d and not \u201cdeal with his grief and underlying issues regarding his mom\u2019s death.\u201d Your dad and step mom don\u2019t see an issue with his behavior because they aren\u2019t the targets. They don\u2019t think there is an underlying issue because they actually *benefit* from the underlying issue. Plus I guarantee their thoughts are \u201cbrothers fight,\u201d and \u201che\u2019s right you should accept step mom.\u201d\n\nAll of this is a round about way of saying your step mom and dad are absolutely, positively, unequivocally the assholes in this scenario. Your brother is the one acting out, but he *is a kid.* A small kid that had some serious mental distress that his dad and step mom basically used to their advantage. And now you leaving is going to absolutely shatter the kid\u2019s world again, because the person he viewed as \u201csafe\u201d is leaving him and has told him outright it\u2019s his fault.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would sit him down and apologize and tell him it\u2019s not totally his fault, but his behaviors towards you are too much to deal with. I know this would be hard and you have a lot of resentment towards your brother, but let\u2019s be real: he\u2019s 13. He is already at an age where everything feels intense and difficult.\n\nThen sit with mom and step dad and be absolutely clear that it is **their fault.** They pushed you away. They refused to deal with your brother a long fucking time ago. Your dad\u2019s job in the aftermath of your mom\u2019s death was to protect you and your brother and he *absolutely and utterly failed on both counts.* Now they have one son leaving them and another with serious abandonment issues that they never addressed but instead used to their advantage.\n\nSo if they want someone to blame, someone to be angry at, they can look in a mirror. They shouldn\u2019t blame your brother, and they sure as shit shouldn\u2019t blame you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA", "NTA.

I think this whole situation would break her heart and I think it would break her heart that I got to the point where I felt that way about him. She was generally a very understanding kind of parent and person and I do hate how much this would hurt her if she were alive and if any kind of afterlife exists I know this must be tearing her up.\n\nHe never stopped saying those things to me.

Take everything important eith you when you move out.", "I think this is logical. You understand why he feels the way he does and he isn\u2019t reciprocating. Perhaps he will as he grows older but I think it\u2019s fair to choose not to involve yourself in his life if he can\u2019t treat you decently and allow you the feelings that you have which are completely natural. Maybe you can go and build up relationships with your moms family to support you in a way that your own family hasn\u2019t", "I think your right he will need to live without to see how awful his behaviour is to you. I think the core issue with why your brother is reacting this way now is he probably has never truly learned of consequences to he actions and so never considered what could and now is happening because of how he and his parents behaved. He probably only considered two outcomes to how he treated you the status quo or him managing to bully you into loving your stepmom. \n\nHonestly you have probably taught him a more valuable life lesson then you father and stepmother ever have or will by your actions. Which is consider the potential consequences of your actions and are you will to accept and live with them. \n\nI hope you find some peace moving to your hometown and away from these toxic aholes.", "There is no reason she should ever need to touch these things. \n\n1.

Your dad should have advocated for you.", "Between you and your brother i'm going with NAH\n\nyour dad and step mom, mega AHs\n\nyou comment your brother saw the person he considers his mother cry. it is not uncommon for young kids to try and defend their parents and say really cruel things to them. and being able to be in another's shoes is very difficult at 7. because trying to do that means letting go of what we believe and know to be true for ourselves and accepting it's not always what they believe or know to be true.\n\nit can be difficult even as we get older too.\n\nnow your brother has still been very verbally abusive to you and nothing can change that even if we can understand why.\n\nnot to mention, he was allowed to do this by your dad and step mom because it fit the narrative they wanted. they had a responsibility as adults and parents (to him) to correct his behavior and teach him why that isn't ok. they failed this. thus it continued. again doesn't excuse it and one day he will have to own it and learn it himself. it only explains it.\n\nmeanwhile you have been the victim to this ongoing abuse and neglected by your parent (dad) who has also failed you as a parent and adult.\n\nsomething your brother has said in both of your scenarios does lead me to some concern about him is\n\n\"love HIM enough to love and accept her, so he could have a real family\"\n\"why I can't stay for him\"\n\nthis makes me wonder his concept of family and if he has fears of abandonment in general. things that would be best explored with a professional\n\nhe's clearly been under a delusion that he could abuse you and you would still stay for him. or that being siblings excuses his behavior. you leaving is a natural consequence of the treatment you have endured in that house.\n\nI wish you luck in your next adventure OP. time will tell what it will entail.", "At title I was ready to sympathize with your brother but to be so cruel to you for years and then say \u201cYOU\u2019RE not supposed to be mean to ME.\u201d Is beyond fucked.

Even if it\u2019s maybe not old enough to suppress those impulses.", "YTA\n\nYou are so immature. Shape up before you do ruin every family relationship you have.\n\nYou\u2019re the older sibling. Your younger brother was lashing out. Figure out why a child might be doing that.", "YTA - but you are not wrong", "NTA", "NTA\n\nthis situation is your dad\u2019s fault. Your brother\u2019s cruelty comes from childish insecurity, which he may one day outgrow. There may be a time when he realizes what he did to you, and if so, he might be genuinely sorry. If he is genuinely sorry and expresses his regret for hurting you, would you ever consider forgiving him? I only ask because your dad\u2019s lack of sensitivity to his children is what got you two into this antagonistic relationship to begin with. And while it would be tragic for you to never have a relationship with your brother, tragedies do happen, and you wouldn\u2019t be wrong for wanting to protect yourself from cruelty of any kind. Again, NTA. Your dad allowed his new relationship to be a wedge between you and your brother, which really sucks.", "NTA. There is an AH here and he goes by dad. Why would he allow his wife to ruin your mother's things is beyond me. Your dad is at fault here first and a pushy step mother second. Your brother is too young to remember your mom but that doesn't let him off the hook. He has said awful things to you and is now facing the consequences for his words. He needs to understand that. Your dad really is an AH for allowing all this in the first place.", "NTA but\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s a LOT going on and a lot to unpack here. \n\nI think something is up with your stepmom. A lot of adult women have failed to have their neurodivergence properly assessed and diagnosed.  I\u2019m struggling all my life with ADHD and only in my 50\u2019s am I finally realizing what it is, now that the information is finally out there.  \n\nAnd knowing this and understanding how it has affected me and my relationships all my life is life changing. It\u2019s empowering to finally have the name for the \u201cdifference\u201d in me that\u2019s been tripping me up all my life. I am gathering the information I need to navigate this life better and connecting with others like me so I no longer see myself as someone who should retreat from life.  \n\nPart of why your stepmom has been so pushy may be tied up in self esteem issues from being the chronic screw-up who is always destroying things with her absent mindedness.  \n\nAnother Redditor informed me even as late as the 2000\u2019s girls weren\u2019t being evaluated for it like boys were.  So your stepmom could easily have fallen through the cracks.  \n\nSo, that possibility is something that should be lovingly brought up to her so she can get the help and support she needs to be better and do better for herself and her family and for you.  There are a LOT of associated emotional impulse control issues that accompany ADHD. \n\nIt can also play out as anxiousness and impulsiveness.  In my case, there\u2019s definitely an eagerness to connect to other people, but a devastating awkwardness in carrying that out.  And of course there are other forms of sensory processing disorders and other neurological or psychological issues she might have instead.  The point is, she should start opening her mind to the possibilities and opportunities to improve things for herself.  Even if she ends up not getting a diagnosis, she can learn hints that could still help her. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to grow up with that.  But I think if you can open your mind to accepting she\u2019s maybe not intentionally being an asshole to you, it will help you to heal in some way.  It\u2019s so much harder to let go of anger and move on when someone\u2019s troubles seem aimed at you in a way that is personal.  I have had my share of dealing with that with a mother who had trauma induced mental health issues.  \n\nYour dad should have gotten you and your brother grief counseling or therapy or something.  It should NEVER have been permitted for your brother to direct all of his pain onto you. Your dad and stepmom definitely failed you boys in this respect. \n\nOf course you\u2019re feeling the way you do and said what you said!  I\u2019m the mother of an 18-year old. I know good and well there\u2019s only so many stressors anyone, but especially a teenager, can put up with before letting loose exactly what they think of the b.s. raining down on them. \n\nEverything you\u2019re going through and your brother is going through and the issues your stepmother displays and your father\u2019s disengagement are all way beyond the scope of judging who is and isn\u2019t an asshole.\n\nYour whole family needs professional support to examine why things have reached this point and how to address it all properly.  \n\nGood luck.  I can\u2019t tell you what to feel or do or even judge you for any of it.  I can only wish you the very best for your life and give you my deepest condolences on the loss of your mother.", "There's seems to be a lot of more context needed for this situation, I'm leaning more into a soft ESH.\n\nThe biggest players that are the AHs in this case are your dad and stepmom for enabling this conflict. However, your stepmom trying to be a mother for you is only because she loves you, and it must really hurt to constantly be rejected by a kid she took on and treated as her own.\n\nIf your brother has been saying cruel things to you, it is their responsibility to nip that behavior in the bud and get your brother help for the underlying reasons he is lashing out. It's not on you, a teenager, to be an emotional punching bag for your younger brother.\n\nHowever, it does seem there's some mutual resentment between you and your brother. Your brother doesn't remember your mom and is finally happy he has a complete family. However, you don't want your mom's memory to be forgotten and you can't accept your stepmom trying to be a mother for you. Destroying your special mementos, the only thing you have left of your mom was not okay. There seems to be some conflict between you seeing him happy he has a family while he's cruel to his older brother, and him seeing you as trying to break up your family because he doesn't understand the hurt you feel.\n\nThese kinds of issues are incredibly complicated and the only way to really work through them is going to therapy and addressing the issues together as a family. Having a mutual respect for every person involved.\n\nThat being said, as you graduate and move out, I hope you are able to heal and honor yourself and the relationship you had with your mom. Maybe you'll gain a sense of perspective once you're on your own.", "NTA. He's not worth sticking around for. It was mean, but so is telling your sibling to die repeatedly.

Good luck in moving and your future plans.  You are not wrong for wanting to move away.  I am surprised at your brother's sadness about your moving, he has verbally bullied you for years about how much he dislikes and hates you.", "NTA", "My question is, why does he want you to stay? So he can keep treating you this way? He's been super clear about what he thinks about you. And you're right in saying that's not worth staying for.

This is normal . \n\nThe problem is that your father needed a substitute and he pushed the new wife upon you all. Your brother was small and it\u2019s normal to accept her as a new mom fast and better than you, he also needed one. \n\nAlso, the woman is maybe really a \u201cwalking desaster\u201d and this interfiered with your relationship (as far as I understood from the comments). She didn\u2019t knew how to handle you, as with your brother was easier and she embraced it.\n\nIt\u2019s a really though situation and I believe that couple hours in a family therapy could help all of you to say what you mean in a \u201ccontrolled\u201d environment.\n\nAlso, the behavior of your brother is normal (as bad as it sounds) because he was defending the only mother that he knows, from you - you were the threat in his eyes but he loves you, he doesn\u2019t see his actions as bad (given the fact that your father doesn\u2019t step-up as well).\n\nI think that you were too harsh on your brother but you also have a lot build-up in you and it\u2019s practically logical to say these words to him, but they were cruel.\n\nAgain - it is a bad situation and I think it will be good to go to some therapy to say everything and to search for a professional\u2019s POV.\n\nP.s.

That your feelings are valid, and that you don\u2019t need to take abuse from anyone just because she is gone. She would tell you to live your life for you, and that she is proud of you. \n\nAnd she would tell your brother that she is very disappointed in him. \n\nDon\u2019t let anyone make you feel guilty for your feelings or for moving on and away from this mess.", "It's never too late to build a new relationship with him from scratch, with some distance.
