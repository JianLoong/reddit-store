Dad moved us to another state on the other side of the country after and remarried 2 years later. I don't like his wife. She tried to be a mom to both my brother and me. My brother considers her his mom. I do not. She tried super hard. But she fucked up things and was too pushy. She ruined some photos of mom by touching them with greasy hands and she lost a box of collectables I kept in my room that my mom and I collected together. The box was found weeks later. But she was always so upset that I was mad at her for those things. She's like that in general, loses a lot of stuff and ruins stuff when cooking or prepping food. But I found it incredibly disrespectful to not take more care of stuff that reminded me of mom. Add to that how pushy she was about being mom and how whiny she was when I would tell her I have a mom already. She also never apologized for losing/ruining the stuff. She just said she didn't mean to, which is not an apology and is not good enough.\n\nEver since dad married her she has been mom to my brother and he loves her, a lot. He does not like that I don't love her and that I don't want her to be my mom. He was 7 when he started saying really cruel things to me over it. A few times he said he wished I had died with mom because it would have been easier, other times he has told me he hates me and that I deserve to be alone forever, he told me he was glad I was upset over mom because I deserved to be upset. He also told me I was the worst brother ever and he wished he never had a brother. The wishing he never had a brother he has said to me more than 100 times. I lost count after a while but I did keep track for a while. I would try to explain the difference in our relationship with dad's wife but he would refuse to understand. He told me to love HIM enough to love and accept her, so he could have a real family. I once asked him to put himself in my shoes and how he would feel if dad's wife died, if dad remarried would the new woman be mom? Would he just stop missing her and put all his love into a new mom. My brother said it was different. He called me names. He told me he hated me.\n\nI am moving back to my home state after graduation. I have made my plans known to dad, his wife and my brother. My brother was upset when he heard I was going and I told him he should be glad because he can now have what he always wanted; to not have me as a brother. He wasn't happy though and then the other night he asked why I can't stay for him, why I need to move so far away. I told him he's not worth staying for. That all he ever does is wish me dead, away or say he hates me. I told him that's not worth sticking around for. He cried. For the first time since he was a toddler he cried. He told me I'm not supposed to be mean to him. Dad was furious too.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681892769, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rly7o/aita_for_telling_my_brother_hes_not_worth/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He was already upset I was leaving and wanted me to stay and when I said that to him it made him cry.

Given how often your brother has told you he wants you dead I wouldn't trust him near those belongings. He needs some serious therapy. \n\nYour Dad and stepmom are monsters", "NTA", "NTA, yeah he\u2019s young he\u2019s 13 but at 13 you know better than to say hurtful things and to be wishing death upon someone. You have every right to feel upset with his behavior and it\u2019s valid that you don\u2019t want to stick around to be verbally abused by your little brother. Does your dad know all the things he\u2019s said to you?", "NTA", "NTA \nDoubt your dad was furious when your brother was being so cruel.", "NTA , let's not ignore the fact that you are a child too when you had to swallow those hurtful words , he is still a child but so were you when you had barely anyone who understood your side , step mom seems very suspicious about loosing stuff constantly and stuff always involves around your bio mom .", "Okay, just for some perspective and a bit of devil\u2019s advocate, but I\u2019ll start with this:\n\nYour dad and step mom are absolutely assholes.\n\nThat said:\n\nYour brother was 3 when his mom died and he likely has no memory of her, aside from her being gone. I know it affected him because how could it not? A 3 year old losing his mom is going to have some serious abandonment issues, even though he wasn\u2019t abandoned. A 3 year old would struggle with the concept of abandonment. All he knows is \u201cmom is gone.\u201d\n\nChildren his age tend to lash out at those they feel it\u2019s \u201csafe\u201d to lash out against, especially those with abandonment issues. Your brother won\u2019t lash out against your step mom because deep down his biggest fear is losing another family member and she\u2019s most likely to leave. That\u2019s part of why they seem so connected, to an almost unhealthy degree. It is a similar scenario with your dad. I would bet anything the phrase \u201cdo you want her to leave us\u201d has come out of your dad\u2019s mouth at some point, and if it did your little brother took that to heart in a big, big way.\n\nBut he still has a **lot** of anger and resentment built up and he needed a safe target to direct that anger. Not just from losing his mom and having his life upended, but just the general rigors and hormonal insanity that is \u201cbeing a 13 year old boy.\u201d\n\nSo he lashes out at you. You are the \u201csafe target.\u201d You\u2019re the one in the home he thinks will never leave him, and it makes sense. You\u2019re younger and healthier, and being his brother he understands you *can\u2019t* just up and leave. Or at least you couldn\u2019t before. I don\u2019t think he ever considered that at age 18 you could leave the family.\n\nI highly doubt he\u2019s done much therapy, or if he did the goal was \u201caccept step mom,\u201d and not \u201cdeal with his grief and underlying issues regarding his mom\u2019s death.\u201d Your dad and step mom don\u2019t see an issue with his behavior because they aren\u2019t the targets. They don\u2019t think there is an underlying issue because they actually *benefit* from the underlying issue. Plus I guarantee their thoughts are \u201cbrothers fight,\u201d and \u201che\u2019s right you should accept step mom.\u201d\n\nAll of this is a round about way of saying your step mom and dad are absolutely, positively, unequivocally the assholes in this scenario. Your brother is the one acting out, but he *is a kid.* A small kid that had some serious mental distress that his dad and step mom basically used to their advantage. And now you leaving is going to absolutely shatter the kid\u2019s world again, because the person he viewed as \u201csafe\u201d is leaving him and has told him outright it\u2019s his fault.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would sit him down and apologize and tell him it\u2019s not totally his fault, but his behaviors towards you are too much to deal with. I know this would be hard and you have a lot of resentment towards your brother, but let\u2019s be real: he\u2019s 13. He is already at an age where everything feels intense and difficult.\n\nThen sit with mom and step dad and be absolutely clear that it is **their fault.** They pushed you away. They refused to deal with your brother a long fucking time ago. Your dad\u2019s job in the aftermath of your mom\u2019s death was to protect you and your brother and he *absolutely and utterly failed on both counts.* Now they have one son leaving them and another with serious abandonment issues that they never addressed but instead used to their advantage.\n\nSo if they want someone to blame, someone to be angry at, they can look in a mirror. They shouldn\u2019t blame your brother, and they sure as shit shouldn\u2019t blame you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA", "NTA.
