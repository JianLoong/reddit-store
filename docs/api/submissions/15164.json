Dad moved us to another state on the other side of the country after and remarried 2 years later. I don't like his wife. She tried to be a mom to both my brother and me. My brother considers her his mom. I do not. She tried super hard. But she fucked up things and was too pushy. She ruined some photos of mom by touching them with greasy hands and she lost a box of collectables I kept in my room that my mom and I collected together. The box was found weeks later. But she was always so upset that I was mad at her for those things. She's like that in general, loses a lot of stuff and ruins stuff when cooking or prepping food. But I found it incredibly disrespectful to not take more care of stuff that reminded me of mom. Add to that how pushy she was about being mom and how whiny she was when I would tell her I have a mom already. She also never apologized for losing/ruining the stuff. She just said she didn't mean to, which is not an apology and is not good enough.\n\nEver since dad married her she has been mom to my brother and he loves her, a lot. He does not like that I don't love her and that I don't want her to be my mom. He was 7 when he started saying really cruel things to me over it. A few times he said he wished I had died with mom because it would have been easier, other times he has told me he hates me and that I deserve to be alone forever, he told me he was glad I was upset over mom because I deserved to be upset. He also told me I was the worst brother ever and he wished he never had a brother. The wishing he never had a brother he has said to me more than 100 times. I lost count after a while but I did keep track for a while. I would try to explain the difference in our relationship with dad's wife but he would refuse to understand. He told me to love HIM enough to love and accept her, so he could have a real family. I once asked him to put himself in my shoes and how he would feel if dad's wife died, if dad remarried would the new woman be mom? Would he just stop missing her and put all his love into a new mom. My brother said it was different. He called me names. He told me he hated me.\n\nI am moving back to my home state after graduation. I have made my plans known to dad, his wife and my brother. My brother was upset when he heard I was going and I told him he should be glad because he can now have what he always wanted; to not have me as a brother. He wasn't happy though and then the other night he asked why I can't stay for him, why I need to move so far away. I told him he's not worth staying for. That all he ever does is wish me dead, away or say he hates me. I told him that's not worth sticking around for. He cried. For the first time since he was a toddler he cried. He told me I'm not supposed to be mean to him. Dad was furious too.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681892769, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rly7o/aita_for_telling_my_brother_hes_not_worth/", "score": 2215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Given how often your brother has told you he wants you dead I wouldn't trust him near those belongings. He needs some serious therapy. \n\nYour Dad and stepmom are monsters", "NTA", "NTA, yeah he\u2019s young he\u2019s 13 but at 13 you know better than to say hurtful things and to be wishing death upon someone. You have every right to feel upset with his behavior and it\u2019s valid that you don\u2019t want to stick around to be verbally abused by your little brother. Does your dad know all the things he\u2019s said to you?", "NTA", "NTA \nDoubt your dad was furious when your brother was being so cruel.", "NTA , let's not ignore the fact that you are a child too when you had to swallow those hurtful words , he is still a child but so were you when you had barely anyone who understood your side , step mom seems very suspicious about loosing stuff constantly and stuff always involves around your bio mom .", "Okay, just for some perspective and a bit of devil\u2019s advocate, but I\u2019ll start with this:\n\nYour dad and step mom are absolutely assholes.\n\nThat said:\n\nYour brother was 3 when his mom died and he likely has no memory of her, aside from her being gone. I know it affected him because how could it not? A 3 year old losing his mom is going to have some serious abandonment issues, even though he wasn\u2019t abandoned. A 3 year old would struggle with the concept of abandonment. All he knows is \u201cmom is gone.\u201d\n\nChildren his age tend to lash out at those they feel it\u2019s \u201csafe\u201d to lash out against, especially those with abandonment issues. Your brother won\u2019t lash out against your step mom because deep down his biggest fear is losing another family member and she\u2019s most likely to leave. That\u2019s part of why they seem so connected, to an almost unhealthy degree. It is a similar scenario with your dad. I would bet anything the phrase \u201cdo you want her to leave us\u201d has come out of your dad\u2019s mouth at some point, and if it did your little brother took that to heart in a big, big way.\n\nBut he still has a **lot** of anger and resentment built up and he needed a safe target to direct that anger. Not just from losing his mom and having his life upended, but just the general rigors and hormonal insanity that is \u201cbeing a 13 year old boy.\u201d\n\nSo he lashes out at you. You are the \u201csafe target.\u201d You\u2019re the one in the home he thinks will never leave him, and it makes sense. You\u2019re younger and healthier, and being his brother he understands you *can\u2019t* just up and leave. Or at least you couldn\u2019t before. I don\u2019t think he ever considered that at age 18 you could leave the family.\n\nI highly doubt he\u2019s done much therapy, or if he did the goal was \u201caccept step mom,\u201d and not \u201cdeal with his grief and underlying issues regarding his mom\u2019s death.\u201d Your dad and step mom don\u2019t see an issue with his behavior because they aren\u2019t the targets. They don\u2019t think there is an underlying issue because they actually *benefit* from the underlying issue. Plus I guarantee their thoughts are \u201cbrothers fight,\u201d and \u201che\u2019s right you should accept step mom.\u201d\n\nAll of this is a round about way of saying your step mom and dad are absolutely, positively, unequivocally the assholes in this scenario. Your brother is the one acting out, but he *is a kid.* A small kid that had some serious mental distress that his dad and step mom basically used to their advantage. And now you leaving is going to absolutely shatter the kid\u2019s world again, because the person he viewed as \u201csafe\u201d is leaving him and has told him outright it\u2019s his fault.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would sit him down and apologize and tell him it\u2019s not totally his fault, but his behaviors towards you are too much to deal with. I know this would be hard and you have a lot of resentment towards your brother, but let\u2019s be real: he\u2019s 13. He is already at an age where everything feels intense and difficult.\n\nThen sit with mom and step dad and be absolutely clear that it is **their fault.** They pushed you away. They refused to deal with your brother a long fucking time ago. Your dad\u2019s job in the aftermath of your mom\u2019s death was to protect you and your brother and he *absolutely and utterly failed on both counts.* Now they have one son leaving them and another with serious abandonment issues that they never addressed but instead used to their advantage.\n\nSo if they want someone to blame, someone to be angry at, they can look in a mirror. They shouldn\u2019t blame your brother, and they sure as shit shouldn\u2019t blame you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA", "NTA.

Simply put he\u2019s brainwashed, maybe one day he\u2019ll see it but that won\u2019t be anytime soon. \n\n**You need to get the fuck away from all of them, they will never respect your boundaries regarding your feelings or your mom so long as you stay there and just take it. If I were you I\u2019d tell them all that until they can stop harassing and manipulating you into trying to replace your mother, and respect your feelings and boundaries on the matter there will be zero contact moving forward. That you\u2019ll only entertain the idea of keeping in touch and visiting when they can own up to their behavior and respect your boundaries**. I know it\u2019s hard because I\u2019m betting you just wish he could hear you out, that he could just understand how much his actions have hurt you. He\u2019s too young to have that kind of self reflection now through, and with step mom likely egging it on there\u2019s a change he never will. \n\nIf you stay he\u2019s never going to think about his actions because he\u2019s going to be so focused on yours towards step mom. At least if you\u2019re gone it\u2019ll give him time to think even if he doesn\u2019t get it for another couple years, that\u2019s still sooner than if you\u2019d stay. **I\u2019d recommend getting therapy after your move if you can afford it or have maternal family that can. Not because you\u2019re wrong you\u2019re absolutely not, but because what you\u2019ve gone through is traumatic even if you\u2019ve been conditioned to believe otherwise**. Losing your parent at such a young age is traumatic, having a pushy step mom is traumatic, having your mothers existence erased or disrespected is traumatic, having your brother love your step mom more than your mom is traumatic, having your dad not protect you is traumatic, and having your brother resent you for not loving the boundary pushing step mom that has zero respect for your feelings is traumatic. \n\n**It\u2019s not healthy to bottle that stuff in and just take it, take it from someone who lived though a lot of trauma and did exactly that: it never goes away. It shows up in all aspects of your life from friendships, relationships, sleep patterns, anxiety/anger, etc.** Most importantly though: it\u2019s hard not to fall back into old patterns of abuse (like with that you\u2019re going through now) because it\u2019s familiar and feels normal. **I wish you the best in everything you do and I hope that you can heal those wounds. It\u2019s going to suck leaving them and not speaking to them regardless of how shitty they\u2019ve been. Your step mom less so or none at all, but your dad and brother will be hard**. You may feel like they\u2019re all you have, or make excuses for them, hell you may even gaslight yourself into thinking it wasn\u2019t as bad as you remember so stay strong do not give in until your boundaries are met. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense but it\u2019s just something that feels normal although it\u2019s not, you may not even experience it for years or until they try to contact you laying the guilt on thick and trying to convince you that you\u2019re the cruel one etc.", "Sounds like he got what he wished for. You can excuse a kid saying that shit once or twice out of anger... but constantly saying it over a long period of time is enough to make anyone be unforgiving about it.", "NTA \n\nHe\u2019s 13 and wished you were dead multiple times. He\u2019s old enough to know that\u2019s wrong so good riddance. Hope he grows up and out of this behavior but you got to get away from them people. Hide your keepsakes in case little brother tries to destroy them to get back at you for leaving. Good luck on your move, wish you had a better living parent who was a asshole.", "NTA, but I hope you'll keep in your mind that your brother is 13 right now. In 20 years you will both be so different than you are now, and be able to see this situation with a clarity that you can't even fathom rn. Both of you are grieving the loss of your mom in different ways; him by reattaching himself to a new mom figure, and you by rejecting that person. Both of you are reacting in normal ways given that you were not fully supported at the time of her death. And none of that requires you to change your mind, or treat anyone in your family differently than you are now; you get to remove yourself from bad situations any time you need to. But your brother seems to really love you, so I hope you leave that door open to reconcile one day when you are both far enough away from your crappy situation and these crappy adults for you to realize that you were both doing just trying to protect yourself while stuck in a tough situation.", "this, but also op don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep your brother warm, now that he\u2019s upset you\u2019re leaving. you deserve to live your life in a way that makes you happy.", "Absolutely agree.

You\u2019ve know better because you at least remember what a solid home should be like. \n\nThat comment you told him will stick with him the rest of his life. He will put up so many walls to protect himself that, years from now, he may not even remember what caused his distrust of you.\n\nIt was never right for him to lash out at you. And your Dad should have stepped in. He didn\u2019t. So, sometimes in these stepparent situations, us oldest siblings have to step up and be the adult when our parents can\u2019t or won\u2019t.

He doesn't understand you and you don't understand that he so desperately wants a family. He lashes out as any child would ... and folks on reddit are \"lash him harder!\"...\n\nIf you were kind and mature, you would not have said these things to your brother.

But LB got away with his verbal abuse and his punching bag is going away who threw back in his face that he isn\u2019t worth staying for. Because Im sorry that\u2019s the truth.

FAFO for your brother, enjoy you independence and also find a therapist after you move, it honestly sounds like you have a lot of feelings to unpack, that's not healthy bottling up.

All feelings are valid. Your brother doesn\u2019t know how to feel bad feelings and not blame you. Sounds like maybe you are a bit resentful and angry at your dad\u2019s wife. It is not that different. So show your brother how not to do it. Show him that it\u2019s OK to be mad and sad but not to blame people for feelings. Forgive and grow.", "NTA. I realise he's a kid, and was a younger kid when he said all those hurtful things, and so he likely didn't understand that saying hurtful things can have consequences. However, this is a very significant learning moment for him that he *can't* just go around saying whatever he likes to people and not expect any kickback from it.\n\nIf all goes well, it will be a humbling lesson for him to realise that he needs to watch what he says to people.", "NTA.\n\nDad & SM are, though, for not taking adult responsibility & nipping his hateful comments in the bud.", "It sounds like you need grief counseling.

I know you\u2019re angry at him and that is totally understandable, but please realize he has clearly never had any help processing the loss of his mother either.

Just jumping in to say that it's best if you take the box of collectables and pictures with you, or leave it with someone you really trust to keep it safe for you. Also, try and make digital copies of all your pictures and make sure you keep any pictures you have in a dry place and out of direct sunlight.

But he's only a kid. He doesn't know how to process his feelings about that and is putting pressure on himself to fix the problem. He thinks you are the problem because you're mean to your stepmom - he doesn't see that you're also a kid, and that you've had a very difficult time losing your mom and having your stepmom suddenly come in to your life when you weren't ready for her. That manifests in him saying cruel things to you. He doesn't mean them - he just wants his home to be peaceful, and for everyone to be happy.  He actually loves you, which is why he's upset you're leaving and he wants you to stay.  He's just very stressed by his home situation and probably has been since he was a young kid.\n\nYou're still a kid yourself, really, and your reaction to him is understandable, so I wouldn't call you an AH.
