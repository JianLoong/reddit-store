So I (21 nb)went to my older sister\u2019s (28 f) wedding Friday, she had a no tech rule for the ceremony. Perfectly understandable knowing how much she spent on the videographer. Well from the title y\u2019all should understand I have a continuous glucose monitor that stays quite literally attached to me, I can\u2019t take it off and have to stay within 15 or so few (roughly 3 meters) of the receiver for it to work. Lately I\u2019ve been having issues with my blood sugar dropping with little warning, my monitor gives me alerts when it drops. My sister pulled me aside before ceremony and asked me to \u201cturn off\u201d my monitor so it doesn\u2019t distract from her big day, I told her it doesn\u2019t have an off setting, and I showed her I set it to vibrate and that it was the best I could do. She just said keep it off, and went off to finish getting things set. So I had assumed that meant not to check it unless I got an alert, all good right? Apparently not. Two and a half hours into a three hour Catholic wedding and it vibrates. I check it and I\u2019m at 54. Quick and quietly grab an emergency snack from my bag (small lollipop from an outer pocket that had no zipper) no one but my sister, mother, and stepfather even looked my way. Make it through the rest of the ceremony no problems, and then my sister is pulling me aside and telling me I ruined her special day. She didn\u2019t even let me try and tell her what happened, just goes off at me for breaking the one rule she had and that now everything is ruined, and tells me not to go to the reception because she doesn\u2019t want to see me for awhile. I\u2019m not going to lie I started crying a bit, and told her she was being an ass. Our mother came and told me to stop being a brat and to just apologize. I did not apologizejust, just stormed off and drove to a friend\u2019s place. Now I\u2019ve been getting texts and calls from my sister\u2019s friends and our aunts and cousins, telling me I was an ass for \u201cplaying around with a phone, and making my sister cry at her wedding, and being rude\u201d. When I try and explain what happened all I\u2019m told is that I knew the rules and that I should have waited until the end of the ceremony to be on my \u201cphone\u201d.

Low blood sugar does damage, even if it doesn't get to coma stage, you are NTA for taking care of your medical needs in an appropriate fashion.

He would have been rummaging around to get his glucose test kit out, using the finger pricker to take blood and apply it onto the test strip. Either of them would be about the same level of distracting, but one is a lot quicker and safer for the user.

Your sister is a bridezilla. This is a medical device.", "Nta. I feel like you dying might have really ruined her ceremony.", "I do not get why you are asking us here. You know what you did was not checking your phone. Your own family is also supposed to know that. Something doesn't add up.", "When I would fight with my ex sometimes and she was being particularly stubborn I would tell her that we could basically conduct a poll and nobody would agree with her. I'm not saying this was nice, but I am saying you have conducted said poll and are NTA. I'm sorry your family cares so little for your health. I hope you're able to find and make a family you deserve.", "T1 diabetic here \n\nPlease inform your sister that she's a selfish bitch for risking your health and your life and that she needs to fuck _*all*_ the way off.\n\nNTA", "So your sister would rather have her ceremony interrupted by a couple of EMTs carrying you out to the hospital on a stretcher after administering glucagon when they couldn't wake you up because you became unconscious due to low blood sugar. Also, what kind of mother acts that way about their diabetic child??? My son was dx T1D at 14. If my daughter expressed this idea, I would have put a stop to it when it was first brought up before the wedding. His sister would never act this way, of course, because it is a ridiculous thing to ask of a diabetic. NTA ever. She risked a big interruption of her ceremony, or the loss of her sibling.", "NTA\nYou passing out because of a hypo would cause much more a scene! Imagine people\u2019s attitudes too when they found out it\u2019s because your sister forbade you from checking your CGM.", "Excuse you for trying not to die at her wedding - that would have really taken the focus off of her, imagine how pissed she would be at you then!\n\nYou owe no one an apology NTA", "NTA, It seems the crux of the issue is that they dont take your condition seriously. They dont see it as a condition that requires careful monitoring and care, or you will incur serious risks but instead somewhat of a minor inconvenience. In my opinion, you went above and beyond with the accommodations you did make for them. shame on them. You deserve better.", "She thinks a glucose monitor vibrating ruined her wedding? Wtf? And your mom joining in? What is wrong with your family? Would she have been happier if you passed out or worse, died because of your blood sugar dropping? Would anyone have even known if mom and sister didn't say anything? Do they know you are on a glucose monitor? \n\nNTA. Please take care of yourself.", "NTA.  And a THREE HOUR CATHOLIC WEDDING?  Holy crap.", "NTA. Your sister wanted to deprive you of a needed medical device. Going into a diabetic coma and having EMTs interrupt the wedding might've ruined it but she wanted to endanger your life.\n\nSince when are Catholic weddings 3 hrs though? Mass is typically 45 min. A wedding Mass is an hour. Eastern Catholic services are typically an hour 15 to an hour and a half. Weddings are no longer as they don't include communion.", "NTA, but whoever held a 3 hour wedding is.  I'm not even diabetic, but after an hour and a half, I would have left.", "NTA NTA NTA my brother was a type one diabetic, his blood sugar would dip so fast that sometimes he would get that confusion before he could even get food into him and it was terrible. You can\u2019t shut those things off that\u2019s life and death\n\nGlucose under 50 is a medical emergency. If you would have had a low blood sugar seizure in the middle of her wedding THAT would\u2019ve ruined \u201cher day\u201d a lot more than you just looking at your monitor and getting a snack\n\nI\u2019m appalled that she would treat you like this, if a wedding says no devices they mean they don\u2019t want a bunch of people taking cell phone photos when the photographer is trying to take pictures. That should never EVER mean that you can\u2019t have MEDICAL devices. What if someone had been there who needed oxygen would she have told them to shut off their oxygen machine?\n\nDude tell your parents she\u2019s harassing you about this, I can\u2019t imagine they would be on her side because this is so ridiculous I cannot even stand it", "NTA. Holy fuck. These people are your family? I am so sorry.", "Longtime lurker, first time commenter. Holy shit, is your sister (and family) raging A Hs for this. I\u2019ve had T1D for 40+ years, and my cgm has made recognizing/dealing with lows so much better and less intrusive. The vibration function isn\u2019t loud or intrusive. I\u2019d bet people sitting next to you didn\u2019t even realize you were vibrating.  Expecting you to not deal with a diabetes emergency situation during a 3-hour ceremony? Get outta here. \n\nQuestion: were you diagnosed at an age where your parents needed to take care of you/the betes? I\u2019m horrified at how your sister reacted, but I am assuming that maybe she\u2019s ignorant to diabetes care (not that that excuses things at ALL\u2026) but I\u2019m even more horrified at your parents\u2019 reaction - the people who may have been taking you to doctors appointments, dealing with blood sugar swings, learning about carbohydrate counting/sliding scale insulin/ketones/dka/ANYTHING ELSE DIABETES RELATED. \n\nYou are so definitely NTA.", "Going into a hypoglycemic coma would've caused a real distraction,  the bride is nuts OP. You're NTA", "NTA\n\nYour health comes first, you need to monitor your glucose to make sure you stay in the range.  Your sister is entitled.  So are your mom and relatives.  Fuck that rules....if you had followed the rules, you may end up in ER faster.  Send them the pamphlets on that and block them for time being to let them digest on that pamphlets on that.", "Note to self, tell Grandpa to turn off his pacemaker.", "Or if a doctor was on call, would they have to turn their device off? Or someone awaiting a transplant? Let them all die!", "Wedding, mass, then about an hour cultural ceremony for the groom\u2019s side. Both are Catholic but have very different cultural backgrounds, so I just lumped it all together for the sake of keeping things simple", "Wedding, then mass, and then an hour cultural ceremony for the grooms side. Just lumped it all together as a Catholic wedding because both are catholic, just from different cultural backgrounds", "I\u2019m sorry I just saw that your mom is also on her side, are you supposed to apologize for having an auto immune disorder? Seriously? These people are ableists and horrible", "I got diagnosed with type 1 at 19. I was still living with my mom and stepfather and they were at the hospital with me when I got the diagnosis. I have a suspicion that my stepfather is spinning a very different story about what happened, but until I can get a word in with anyone I won\u2019t know for sure.", "For family who is bitching about \" playing on your phone\" during the ceremony, the reply you suggested would go over their head because of their lack of medical literacy.

I\u2019m allll about clapping back at people but there\u2019s no need to be manipulative about it.", "\u201cY\u2019all it wasn\u2019t a phone it was a glucose meter. I didn\u2019t wanna pass out and ruin the wedding\u201d\n\nYou can get a point across without being manipulative. If a family member texted me \u201cthanks for wishing me dead\u201d I\u2019d literally laugh at them because no one\u2019s really wishing family dead unless you hate them."]}
