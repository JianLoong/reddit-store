So I (21 nb)went to my older sister\u2019s (28 f) wedding Friday, she had a no tech rule for the ceremony. Perfectly understandable knowing how much she spent on the videographer. Well from the title y\u2019all should understand I have a continuous glucose monitor that stays quite literally attached to me, I can\u2019t take it off and have to stay within 15 or so few (roughly 3 meters) of the receiver for it to work. Lately I\u2019ve been having issues with my blood sugar dropping with little warning, my monitor gives me alerts when it drops. My sister pulled me aside before ceremony and asked me to \u201cturn off\u201d my monitor so it doesn\u2019t distract from her big day, I told her it doesn\u2019t have an off setting, and I showed her I set it to vibrate and that it was the best I could do. She just said keep it off, and went off to finish getting things set. So I had assumed that meant not to check it unless I got an alert, all good right? Apparently not. Two and a half hours into a three hour Catholic wedding and it vibrates. I check it and I\u2019m at 54. Quick and quietly grab an emergency snack from my bag (small lollipop from an outer pocket that had no zipper) no one but my sister, mother, and stepfather even looked my way. Make it through the rest of the ceremony no problems, and then my sister is pulling me aside and telling me I ruined her special day. She didn\u2019t even let me try and tell her what happened, just goes off at me for breaking the one rule she had and that now everything is ruined, and tells me not to go to the reception because she doesn\u2019t want to see me for awhile. I\u2019m not going to lie I started crying a bit, and told her she was being an ass. Our mother came and told me to stop being a brat and to just apologize. I did not apologizejust, just stormed off and drove to a friend\u2019s place. Now I\u2019ve been getting texts and calls from my sister\u2019s friends and our aunts and cousins, telling me I was an ass for \u201cplaying around with a phone, and making my sister cry at her wedding, and being rude\u201d. When I try and explain what happened all I\u2019m told is that I knew the rules and that I should have waited until the end of the ceremony to be on my \u201cphone\u201d. I\u2019m starting to wonder if I really am the asshole here and should apologize.", "created_utc": 1679202460, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vc26z/aita_for_not_turning_off_my_continuous_glucose/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have a medical condition that you dealt with as discretely as possible, and your sister blew it out of proportion and insisted you \"ruined\" her day. Would your other relatives have even known about \"the incident\" (aka you taking action so you DIDN'T EFFING DIE) had your sister not made such a big deal out of nothing?\n\n\"No technology\" when used to exclude assistive, life-saving devices is ableist BS. Ask your sister what she prefers: (1) \"ruining\" her big day by you using the alert device as needed or (2) you ACTUALLY ruining her big day by needing to be carted off to the hospital because you failed to take a simple, preventative measure?\n\nSeriously, your siser and all your family member are AH 100% for this. Would they be OK if your sister told you that you couldn't bring your motorized wheelchair to the wedding because of the \"no technology\" rule? Seriously, what horrible people!", "NTA\n\nBut your sister and her flying monkeys puts the A in UrAnus.\n\nMy daughter's best friend has a continuous glucose monitor. Is is the absolute best! I lost a friend to a diabetic incident in college and I am so overjoyed that they exist. \n\nIf I was the bride and it my daughter's / my brother's / my guest's /  a complete stranger's monitor that went off I'd be stopping the whole show to get that fixed. The fact that your sister thinks that your life is less important than her 15 min (3 hours!) of fame is appalling.", "NTA and frankly I'd disown everyone who is demanding you apologize for NOT HOSPITALIZING YOURSELF.  That's what your sister requested and is insisting you should have done, and that your mom is expecting you to apologize for.  These are NOT the actions of people you want in your life.  If they'd prefer you hospitalize yourself/potentially die to accomodate sister I say grant them their wish of no longer having to worry about you by leaving the entire lot of them to never return.", "There is no way this is real life", "Not a real story. Am I supposed to believe your entire close family does not know you are diabetic and that you need a glucose monitor? Yta for feeding us a bs story", "Both your sister and mother are AH!", "Your mom should be ashamed of herself\nYour sister really sucks and is a total AH\nYou should tell everyone involved exactly what happened, and what the concequences arevof a diabetic not dealing with a drop in blood sugar. \n\nNTA\n\nTime to distance yourself from your sister in a substantial way. Tell your mother to fuck off when she tries to intervene", "NTA\n\nYour medical condition should not be news to your family. What a bridezilla. Why did she even notice or care that you had to glance at your phone?", "NTA at all", "NTA Your sister is. This device is a medical necessity. If your unreasonable sister and your family can't understand and accept that then it's on them. You did nothing wrong. The only one ruining the day was your sister.", "NTA - you were EXTREMELY reasonable. She had very unrealistic expectations and was being an asshole about it.", "You poor thing. NTA. Those people are awful.", "NTA OP. \n\nTell them that they have no say in your medical condition. The likelihood is thay your sister has made a much bigger deal out of you getting your phone out than was warranted, and has made it out to be completely different than what it was.\n\nYour sister is an absolute AH for suggesting that you risk hypoglycaemia coma- because of course the outcome of you having a hypo would not have affected the wedding at all. Low blood sugar does damage, even if it doesn't get to coma stage, you are NTA for taking care of your medical needs in an appropriate fashion.  No tech should relate to no one using their phone for leisure or standing up getting in the way, or having people ring them. Not for a necessary medical adjustment.\n\nMy husband also has one of these. They are quite literally a lifesaver for anyone who cannot tell their blood sugar is dropping.  If my husband didn't have one, you know what he would have been doing in the of the wedding? He would have been rummaging around to get his glucose test kit out, using the finger pricker to take blood and apply it onto the test strip. Either of them would be about the same level of distracting, but one is a lot quicker and safer for the user. I know how difficult it is to do a blood test on someone who has passed out and is unresponsive, and then try to deal with their hypo - that would have been a lot more distracting for a wedding than you quietly dealing with it yourself.", "NTA. \n\nImagine the distraction an ambulance would have been if you hadn\u2019t grabbed your lollipop.\n\nShe ruined her own wedding by being herself.", "NTA. Your Mom is though for letting everyone pile on when she must know what the issue is. Your sister is being ridiculous and you don\u2019t owe anyone an apology.", "NTA.

Your sister sounds like she needs professional help.  I mean, going off on you for getting an alert from your glucose monitor?!?  That\u2019s just nuts, and the family members who are insisting that YOU apologize for it need to butt out.", "It\u2019s a great question. I think it\u2019s a combination of a few things:\n- not dealing well with preparing for the attention they will receive\n- over-valuing the once in a lifetime nature of it\n- letting their ugly true colors come through because it\u2019s \u201ctheir day\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t want to burst anyone\u2019s bubble that is getting married, but I really wish people knew how unimportant the wedding will feel once it\u2019s done.

I\u2019m a diabetic I have glucose drops like OP and being in a crowded venue like a wedding SOMEONE would have noticed them passing out. \n\nBut truly op passing out and being taken to the hospital WOULD REALLY have put a damper on the ceremony.", "I agree with this.
