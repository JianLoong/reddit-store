She calls every day wanting to know one of three things. 1. Where are you? 2. Why won't they let me leave? 3. How are my pets? The backstory or pets change based on what year she thinks it is. Sometimes she's angry or upset or the nurses call me to see if I can get her to calm down or take her medicine. To help calm her down I'll usually say I'm on my way and I have her pets with me and they're all fine. White lies and she forgets soon enough anyway.\n\nOur dad (70-somethingM) has decided he doesn't feel right about lying to her. Today, for instance, she asked about our childhood dog. He told her the dog died a long time ago, and sis was devastated. She reacted as if she was hearing this for the first time, which she basically was. She focused long enough to then call me and she was absolutely sobbing about our childhood dog. I finally calmed her down through redirection and she hasn't called back which means she's fine.\n\nDad and I have talked about the ethical matter of lying to a family member with no memory, and we landed on different sides of line. I feel it's cruel to essentially make her relive trauma like grief over and over and over, even if it's temporary. I don't like lying, but feel like that's a me problem, not a her problem. At the end of the day I'd rather see her happy.\n\nI'm not sure I totally see dad's point of view, though. I think he might feel like he wouldn't want to be lied to under the same circumstances.

Student nurse here who's already been trained in the social side of dementia care. You don't correct people with dementia unless their in danger. To constantly correct them just makes them distressed and upset, it's a horrible way for them to live.\n\nYour dad is hurting her. He needs to accept that who she once was is gone, she'll never remember things properly again and telling her the truth will never lead to her developing as a person. If he doesn't want outright lie he needs to instead redirect her away from the topic. But he can't keep doing this. It's not best practice and it's overall more stressful for everyone involved. I get the ick factor, but that ick factor only stays if your seeing them as the same person they once were. \n\nYour dad needs to speak to a professional about this, he's obviously going through something harsh seeing his child like this. But your sister shouldn't have to live every day in tears because dear old dad can't suck it up for her, it's torture. Keep doing what your doing OP, and do your best to stop this. Especially if he's then not going to be the one to calm her down. what a horrible thing to do to suck a vulnerable person.", "NTA- your sister is lost in time. There's no need to make her relive deep grief over and over every day or week. Telling her that the pets are safe is reassuring to her and keeps her calm. This is a kindness not something to be ashamed of. Your dad is 100% wrong about telling her the truth.", "My dad died of Alzheimer's two years ago.  My perspective on this is that when the person is like your sister and my dad, lying to them is a kindness.  Their quality of life with dementia is not good.  Telling them things that lead to greater suffering is cruel and only brings them pain.  None of it is easy.  All of it sucks.  Honestly, if I were in your shoes I would explore a conservatorship and do whatever it took to keep that from happening over and over.  In fact, I did.  It was awful.  In my opinion, the right thing to do.\n\nEdit: Forgot to say, NTA.", "NTA.   Tell her what makes her feel okay, or safe.  This isn\u2019t about you or your dad, it\u2019s about what\u2019s best for her state of mind.  She has dementia.  Truth is a grey area now and that\u2019s fine. You\u2019re not hurting her by telling her things that make her feel safe, or secure, or loved.", "I remember my uncle going through a similar issue with my aunt. He'd never lied to her, and when her dementia got to the point you're talking about with your sister, he fell in the same place as you. He was an incredibly ethical person who loved his wife very much. He realized that lying was only one of the ethical issues at play. Kindness vs cruelty was much more relevant and pressing, and he chose kindness. As you said, the discomfort with lying is your problem to manage, not your sister's. Unfortunately, your father isn't the one dealing with the aftermath of his \"honesty.\" If he's actually a kind and loving person, he needs to start being confronted with the fallout so he can understand what he's doing to his daughter. Recording her when she calls violates her privacy, but she she calls you sobbing afterwards, call him afterwards and tell him about it in detail. Hopefully if he recognizes the harm he's causing, he'll find an alternative response. NTA", "NTA. I used to work with patients with dementia regularly and was a caregiver for my grandmother with Alzheimer\u2019s for almost ten years. Limiting their stress levels leads to MUCH better health outcomes longer term. You are 100% doing the right thing. Validating her concerns and giving her reasonable excuses to limit emotional distress is the clinically correct thing to do, and I\u2019d argue the ethically right thing to do as well. I\u2019m glad she has someone like you to love and support her.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nFirstly, I\u2019m very sorry your sister has dementia at such a young age. My grandfather had dementia for the last few years of his life, and it was heartbreaking to watch. Correcting a person with dementia serves no purpose other than causing them unnecessary confusion and panic. I understand that your dad feels guilty lying to his vulnerable daughter. But this is not about him or his guilt, he needs to set that aside and see the bigger picture. This is about making his daughter feel safe and happy as much as possible in her current situation. I hope he will come to realize that. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing, OP.", "NTA - best practice is to not challenge/correct dementia patients, for pretty much the reasons you've given. It can retraumatise them every time they hear about the death of a loved one (human or pet), and then not only are they incredibly upset, so are you, and it also impacts on the care staff who are then in the position of having to support someone who is distressed and may react aggressively. \n\nIt is so difficult to lie or be fuzzy about details in this situation. With my grandpa, he would ask about my nana, and we would tell him she was out for lunch or had gone for a walk etc, which he accepted. She'd died 3 years earlier (also with dementia). He'd forget about the entire conversation a few moments later, but it would break my heart a little each time. I'd rather have my heart broken a little than have him repeatedly grieving the loss of his wife though. That would just be cruel. You and I have the capacity to understand what is happening here. Your sister does not, and it would be unfair to her to pretend that she does.\n\nI'm not a fan of lying, especially to manipulate people, but this isn't what you are doing here - it isn't the same intent. You're avoiding adding to any distress, and you're helping her be comfortable and safe. You're not adding to the already heavy care load the staff are managing by making her upset. \n\nYour dad might need to talk to someone about this though. His stance would be reasonable in almost any other circumstance, but the whole \"lying is wrong and you shouldn't do it\" goes out the window when it comes to dementia related disorders. The facility should have a staff member who works with family members and can support your dad with this. It can often help if the information comes from a professional (even when they are saying exactly what you've already said lol), and they may have access to resources that can help you both learn more about what your sister is experiencing, and to find supports for you too.", "NTA.  I promise.\n\nI feel like as long as she's not putting herself in danger it's best practice to go along with it.  There's no long term good or help that comes from breaking her heart over and over again with the truth if she's just going to forget it.", "NTA your dad needs to learn to understand dementia a bit more and he is sort of the AH here. To her it isn't lying,this is her reality of what she believes. Unsettling her and causing her. Distress about something she believes are alive and fine is cruel.  Only exceptions are if they are frightened by hallucinations they see but are in a lucid time where explaining what they're seeing isn't real but that's few and far between.", "NTA and I\u2019m a nurse and I agree that it\u2019s not necessary to make some relive trauma every day. Maybe you can find a way to answer her questions without lying. For example, when my mom got cancer that went to her brain she developed dementia. One day she was crying because she couldn\u2019t find her sister. I didn\u2019t want to remind her that her sister is dead, but I didn\u2019t want to lie either. So I told her that her sister is in a safe place and she\u2019s ok. That worked for her", "NTA \n\nWhat your dad is doing isn\u2019t noble it\u2019s cruel. Dementia is an awful disease, as you know. She is confused and frustrated so often, she doesn\u2019t need more emotional distress piled on. She can\u2019t retain the information he\u2019s giving her, so the only meaningful difference is how upset she is. \n\nYour dad is prioritizing his emotional comfort over that of your sister and it\u2019s not okay. Doing right by her means meeting here where she is, easing her anxiety/frustration when you can, and accepting that your emotions are your problem because your sister is already carrying the heaviest burden. \n\nThe medical professionals recommend going with the delusions of dementia patients and actively recommends against challenging them because it leads to intense emotional distress most of the time. You might want to see if you can find some articles on that to send to your dad.", "NTA. This white lies you tell her make her day and the day of the people that care for her less stressful. \n\nMy family took care of my grandmother who suffered from dementia for 8 years before she passed away. She would often ask about her brothers who died during WWII or my grandfather who was also dead by this point. We would tell her they are on their way and she would go on with her day. \n\nFrom my experience giving somebody who has dementia the feeling that there is nothing to worry about is the best way to handle such heartbreaking interactions.", "I have the same argument with a friend of mine; I strongly take the position that it\u2019s cruel to cause your loved one trauma over and over when you can spare them by telling them a white lie. My friend\u2019s position is basically \u201clying is wrong\u201d.  I think causing unnecessary suffering is way worse. We\u2019ll probably never see eye-to-eye on this, but I 100% believe in my position. \n\nNTA and please continue to show your sister love and compassion.", "NTA. There is something wrong with your dad. Either extreme cruelty or just plain being dumb as hell. I understood as a ten year old that you don\u2019t always tell someone with dementia the raw truth.", "NTA and completely agree with you that it\u2019s very cruel to constantly make her relive that grief over and over again, especially when there\u2019s another, better, more kind option.", "At this stage, lying is the appropriate and kind thing to do. What's the point of making her relive sad moments over and over again? Your dad would benefit from reading up on interacting with dementia patients to make their lives as calm as possible.", "She's constantly confused and concerned and probably frightened. The very best thing you can do for her is alleviate that distress. This is the mental equivalent of palliative care. It's not about a cure, it's about comfort. Keep granting her whatever happiness you can.\n\nI really appreciate your comment that feeling bad about lying is a you problem not a her problem. I hope you can help your father feel similarly. Would this help...\n\nDid he tell her Santa existed? Did he read her fairy stories? Did he maybe hide from her the fact that a person or a pet may have suffered? If he did any of these things to make her happy or protect her from being upset as a child, maybe he can understand that he needs to draw on the same sensitivities now.\n\nFinally, I am so sorry you and your father are going through this. It's always horrible, but that is amplified when the patient is so young. I hope you have the support of plenty of people who love you.", "above our pay grade for sure, but my underpaid opinion is on your side. I'm hesitant to call pops an asshole though so NAH", " NTA. We always say join their journey. You might feel guilty or sad for the lies. However your loved one with dementia is that day, minute, hour. They need to feel safe even when they are u sure, words of encouragement and safety are honestly the best thing you can do in this situation. Keep loving your sister just as you are.", "NTA.\n\nDementia is a HORRIBLE disease. Both my grandparents have it and they have both just gone into a nursing home because they aren't safe to be at home even if one of us is there all the time. It's HARD. Don't distress them unnecessarily.", " NTA. Maybe some one at your sister\u2019s home could speak to your dad? He should understand that she is reliving the first pain of sad news over and over.", "NTA. If I'm remember correctly family members are advise to 'play along' with dementia patients so they don't get confused or upset. \n\nCan you imagine how hard it would be to be reminded you're losing your mind over and over all day.", "My mom cares for people with dementia and always says that it isn't really lying. You are filtering information to reduce harm and really there is no benefit to telling someone who won't remember if that information will cause pain. \n\nI feel for your dad though. No parent ever thinks they would have to watch their child go though something like this and it cannot be easy for him.\n\nNAH.", "NTA. At this point the truth is cruel. I don't know how many times I told my sundowning grandmother that my grandfather was just at the pub with his mates and would be home for dinner.

You are a good sister.", "NAH. I approach it like this: When you\u2019re talking with someone who has dementia, it\u2019s important for you to be living within their truth, and their reality. A lot of the facts of your life are not of particular relevance to that reality.

You need to meet them in their reality, and give them the message that everything is okay in words that they will understand and that means telling her the pets are alive, happy and well. Perhaps it might help to think of it as time travelling with her - at the time that she's in when she asks, the pets are alive, you know?
