The fact that he escalated to guilting you and casting the blame your way tells you there was not some sort of genuine realization.

As others have said, I would also suspect this has more to do with funeral expenses than anything (and perhaps the estate, and your mother\u2019s reputation with others). \n\nKicking kids out for being LGBTQ is incredibly common, as is making life so intolerable they run away. One-third to more than one-half of unhorsed youth became homeless this way.

Most had been kicked out or estranged from their families. I can\u2019t think of a single case where there was genuine understanding of the harm and remorse coming due to death nearing. When that regret came it came long before. \n\nWhat I did see was parents taking money my clients had saved to pay for their own funeral and stealing it before having their son buried as a pauper. What I did see was parents kicking the long-time partners of my clients out of their homes and taking anything they could of value from couple who had been to get her for 10, 20 years.", "Very good point on this.

Even if she tried but couldn't the guy did but never seemed to have offered to do so for both of their sakes until he wanted something. Which is the only reason he reached out.

No DNA, heavy emphasis on eyewitnesses (which we know now is some of the least reliable evidence), much more public confidence in the testimonies of police, heck even the now contested lie detector testing was admissible as evidence.\n\nNot to mention, of course, that well into the *1970's* and beyond, most states' jury pools were more than likely 100% male due to a lot of states having \"opt-in\" or \"opt-out\" requirements for women to choose to enter or be removed the jury pool while for men it was mandatory.\n\n(Resulting in cases like Hoyt V Florida (1961) where a battered woman was convicted of the murder of her abusive husband and her county had something like 40,000 male jurors and 200 something female jurors in the pool, so she received a 100% male jury which we can't deny more than likely influenced the outcome of the trial.) \n\nIn 1973, Ruth Bader Ginsburg even brought forth a case against this opt-in policy for female jurors in Louisiana (Healy v Edwards), but it wasn't until a separate case in *1975* that Louisiana removed this policy.
