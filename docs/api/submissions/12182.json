She experienced the consequences of her own actions.  If she was really that repentant, she would have reached out long before he did.  Unless you changed your name or have an extremely common name, it's not hard to track people down.\n\nHer surrogate son should be responsible for the funeral/burial.", "NTA. People can change and get 2nd chances but that 2nd chance doesn't need to come from you. She got her 2nd chance with a surrogate son. You don't owe her shit.", "NTA.  Kicking your own child out of house and home because of their sexuality is a cruel and heartless thing to do. If she had had the faintest glimmer of remorse she would have reached out herself. Hostility of reply is absolutely justified.", "Who the fuck is this guy? The nerve. NTA\n\nMy first thought would be \u201cthis dude is a scammer\u201d like if he is trying to find info on you\u2026 is he the same age as you? Did your mother have and of your vital documents? Birth certificate? Social security card? \n\nIf he had access to her before she died and is now contacting you, I\u2019d look into identity protection services.", "NTA. First, I want to say I\u2019m so sorry your mom kicked you out because you\u2019re gay!! That is complete BS. Second, your mother did this and then never attempted to apologize or patch things with you. Of course you shouldn\u2019t have to arrange her funeral. Your mom is definitely the AH. This other son should have respected your decision and left you alone. I understand why you feel this way.", "NTA - and he was really overstepping what is appropriate. Yes he reached out once, but when you say no that is where that should have ended. You made your desires very clear to him, and he ignored it. That is on him, not on you. \nYou do not have to forgive someone if you don\u2019t want to.", "NTA, but isn't it better to just block thus guy?  Just give him a polite-ish send off message saying never contact you again, block him, and move on with life.", "NTA at all. That guy sounds super creepy.

It\u2019s not this guys business idk why he\u2019s meddling so much.", "NTA - If she really changed why did she not reach out before to makes amends? It\u2019s one thing to really change and another to regret your actions when you know you\u2019re dying.

You don\u2019t owe her anything.  \nI don\u2019t think he\u2019s an asshole for originally reaching out to find you, people do sometimes want to reconnect in these situations, but once you clearly stated that you had no interest he should have stopped. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this.", "Definitely NTA-it\u2019s actually HER fault she never got the chance to make it right. If her SS could find you, then from that point on, she had your contact info.", "NTA what a effed up situation. \n\nYou owed this woman nothing. She had PLENTY OF TIME to reach out and all of a sudden she was dying and thought \"huh I shouldn't have done that awful thing to my son\".\n\nGood she realized it I guess, but it wasn't your job to make her feel better. She did a horrible thing to you as a young child. \n\nIt's great to forgive people when you can. In this case though, it wasn't deserved.", "NTA. This other dude really needs to fuck right the hell off. He should have took the hint after the first call. He's harassing you now.", "NTA. Cremate her and put her in the dumpster.", "> it was my fault she never got to make it right and I was unfair on him.\n\nNo, absolutely not. If she wanted to make it right, she could have done that herself. Instead, she was too cowardly to do that before she died,  it is not up to you to make amends for the wrong doings of your mother, or for anyone else.\n\nI do recommend forgiveness though. Not for her. She doesn't deserve it. But for you. Forgiving her will help you heal, and may give you peace, and the ability to let go of the hurt, and anger.\n\nNTA.", "NTA My mother is TOXIC don\u2019t even get me started!!! 5 years ago I walked away.

Your mother, your relationship, your emotions. Her fault for never making it right. Hopefully that situation taught her something and she tried to make up for it by being kind to the other guy - but it's between her and him, you don't owe her forgiveness.", "NTA. Your response was justified give what you mother did to you.  If she wanted to make amends she would have done so while she was alive. Block this stranger. It's his circus and his monkey now not yours.", "NTA. You owe the woman nothing.", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA and you have every right to your feelings. A mom who deserted you for no fault of your own can only get what's offered to her. Your response came from your heart and no amount of last minute grief is going to change it for you. Look after yourself.", "NTA. Hard hard NTA!  Your boundaries are very reasonable and he is way over stepping his bounds!", "NTA. Who the hell does he think he is? Block him, if he persists report him for harassment. Although it must be mildly tempting to take over the funeral and turn into an appropriately cursory event, that'll probably come with more emotional trauma that you don't need. Telling him to fuck off seems like the best move.", "NTA - Your mom was cruel to you and this guy sucks too , block him", "NTA, people owe their abusers nothing", "This \u2018surrogate son\u2019 sounds incredibly tone deaf, and your mother is a massive AH. \n\nI\u2019m NC with my parents, and if I was in your situation I feel like that would compound the pain and hurt knowing that they had made the effort for someone that wasn\u2019t even related to them, rather than reaching out to their own child. \nDefinitely NTA", "NTA\n\nYour mother was cruel to you in life and now this guy is perpetuating that cruelness in her death, whatever his intentions.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your experience. Block him.", "NTA.\nIm sorry this happened to you OP. And it is very bitter and nasty that she could accept this stranger for who he is, but not her own son who needed her and was thrown away.\nShe didn't deserve forgiveness in the end. And he should have backed off when you said NO the first time.", "She probably accepted him because she realised what she lost with you.\n\nThat said, it was up to you if you accepted. You don't have to do anything you're uncountable with, especially as it's linked to past trauma.\nYou deserved unconditional love from your mother.\n\nTake a breath and think about whether you want to attend the funeral or not, but you definitely shouldn't be planning it. He was right to give you first refusal, BUT if she's like a mum to him, he should plan it knowing you don't want to.\n\nNTA", "NAH: interpersonal relationships are what they are. She chased you away, probably regretted it and tried to make it right by being a better person to this other surrogate child. The fact she hurt you and you're all done with it is your prerogative. The fact he feels she changed and did well by him is his. Just go your own way on this one and don't do anything to hurt this other person. You're not wrong, they're not wrong. It's just a shitty situation, due to her actions in the past.", "NAH, he only knew your accepting mother, you only knew the bigoted one. I can see why he would want to make her finals days special but I can see why you don\u2019t want to be involved. Don\u2019t be harsh on him for what your did to you.", "NAH\n\nI get where he\u2019s coming from - thinking he\u2019s saving you a regret or whatever. I let him be because he said clearly his intentions and ended it after the funeral offer. He pressed, but I appreciated he ended it amicably as he could.\n\nIf you have no remorse to her (which is justifiable, only you know the damage and hurt she cause - you don\u2019t owe forgiveness etc.), you made it abundantly clear to him. That\u2019s that.\n\nSucks people assume others feel regret by not saying bye to a dying person/parent. I would too. That said, I don\u2019t assume my precaution applies to everyone out there. I understand wholly that some pains I cannot even fathom. I\u2019m sorry you had to experience that, and I truly wish you a calm serene relief moving forward with closure (and not remorse at giving her hers).", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
