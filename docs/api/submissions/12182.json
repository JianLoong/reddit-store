I'm sorry you never got to experience a loving mother and son relationship and hope you've moved on", "Yes, OP. I am so sorry this happened to you as a teen. You owe her nothing. You owe him nothing. The fact that he escalated to guilting you and casting the blame your way tells you there was not some sort of genuine realization. At *best* your mother had some sort of victim narrative about it all.  As others have said, I would also suspect this has more to do with funeral expenses than anything (and perhaps the estate, and your mother\u2019s reputation with others). \n\nKicking kids out for being LGBTQ is incredibly common, as is making life so intolerable they run away. One-third to more than one-half of unhorsed youth became homeless this way.  Unsurprisingly, it leads to a host of additional negative outcomes (assault and abuse, drug use, suicide, never graduation HS, etc.). \n\nOP, you SURVIVED. \n\nAnd now she is gone for good. Document this guy\u2019s actions. Inform her appointed/selected attorney of your contact information. And consider a gathering with your family of choice to put her to rest from your life in the way that helps you (a fire pit can help with this). \n\nI was one of the queer women who cared for men with AIDS in the 90s. Most had been kicked out or estranged from their families. I can\u2019t think of a single case where there was genuine understanding of the harm and remorse coming due to death nearing. When that regret came it came long before. \n\nWhat I did see was parents taking money my clients had saved to pay for their own funeral and stealing it before having their son buried as a pauper. What I did see was parents kicking the long-time partners of my clients out of their homes and taking anything they could of value from couple who had been to get her for 10, 20 years.", "Very good point on this.

Fuck off.\"*", "But OP made it clear that he didn\u2019t want contact from the this guy, and he still continued to receive unwanted contact.

OP could be found but she never seemed to have bothered to reach out. Even if she tried but couldn't the guy did but never seemed to have offered to do so for both of their sakes until he wanted something. Which is the only reason he reached out. He doesn't want to pay for the funeral *he* wants for her.", "My parents did this when my sister cut them off. They basically adopted the ex-girlfriend/baby mama of a friend\u2019s son and tried to help her get on her feet. My parents were emotionally abusive and my sister did her best to keep them beyond arms length.", "It's like a dumb version of the movie \"prayers for Bobby\" where the mother (Sigourney Weaver) rejects her son after he comes out and later kills himself.

Private investigators have been around since back when everyone had phone books it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a new thing or one that even requires the user of said service to have internet.", "The second I saw \u201cyoung man befriends ill older person and is now making demands of the deceased\u2019s family\u201d my spidey senses started tingling.", "I'm honestly wondering if maybe SS is telling the truth but was being manipulated by mom. Like maybe she found someone desperate for a mother figure and used him for her own ends. Maybe she knew that OP has or would inherit money from her so planted the idea in SS' head to ask him. \n\nNo matter what tho this is all really creepy and disturbing and SS has no right to contact OP at all, let alone ask for a funeral.", ">Honestly, I wonder if the dude is who he claims to be at all\u2014this whole thing seems sus as hell.\n\nThat was actually my first thought as well. I wouldn't be surprised if Mom is actually still alive and is using this guy to scam her son for money.", "Sadly this is not true in the USA.

That will not undo the abuse and the damage.", "She may have farted candy, but nothing in the post indicates she made any effort\n\nand no, it wouldn't make any difference.

I could be wrong- but that is the rule in several states I lived in over the years.", "Weird that he would spend money on finding information on a guy to do that. Doesn't really make any sense", "Right? Mom finally comes around to the realization that gay people are human beings, but instead of bringing this to her *own son* and patching things up, she takes in a complete stranger? Not buying it. This dude may never have had a relationship with OP's mom at all, or if he did, he found an older lady to glom onto and support him and now he's looking for his next mark.

After all we are all human.\n\nWhat would redemption look like in this case?\n\nI imagine something like:\n1. Reaching out to son to make amends (but was rebuffed)\n2. If #1 is not possible, give the love that you were unable to give to son to someone who needs it who is enduring the same trauma that you inflicted on your son.\n\nOr is it such a big mistake that society should just forever mark her a pariah?", "Of course not entitled to forgiveness from her child..... but society at large?\n\nSounds like reddit has no room for redemption in this scenario.", "I don't understand. Yes, I'm suggesting that mother might be happy if she could make amends with OP.

Murder is illegal- but 85-90% of the time has no repercussions- since we never solve those deaths.  Does not make it any less illegal or wrong.", "Could've also died without a will, in case of which statutory inheritance kicks in. There's no mention of spouse, so the children would be the first in line with OP being the only one and getting 100%.", "Aye. He finds it difficult to reconcile the two halves of this person he wants to see as a saint, and figures that getting OP to forgive her will let him forgive her.", "I can see that happening if the mother was too ashamed by her own actions to reach out. \"I did wrong and I know I'll never be forgiven, but I can go forward and not make the same mistakes again.\" Or even a scenario where mom gradually changed her views... for strangers. She still feels it's wrong for her own child. There are plenty of people who have thought they were safe coming out because they had parents who supported LGBTQ+, only to get disowned because \"we support it! But only when it's other people.\"\n\n\nI can't imagine if the whole thing is a scam, and OP decides to show up to the funeral only to discover not only is their mother alive, but also has not changed her beliefs at all (because it was a scam all along).", "I can buy it. Seen similar. Her own child being gay means no grandchildren, no future to her family,it's a shame on the family,she must have done something wrong. Taking in someone else's gay child doesn't reflect badly on how you raised your child - she has much less skin in the game.\n\nThat doesn't mean this isn't a scammer or someone trying to find a new victim to shakedown using the mother as an entry point. But it's not an impossible scenario IMO and both could be true. SS had a genuine bond with the mother but mooched off her and now needs an alternative.", "She may have accepted that she\u2019d burned her bridge with her son. If people want to be NC then they should be allowed to be NC \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for her to chase after OP to get him to forgive her. IDK what \u201camends\u201d she could really have made to OP, long after she\u2019d disowned him.\n\nBut, if that was the case, then this \u201csurrogate son\u201d needs to accept that that was her choice: to not chase after OP, but mend her own ways.
