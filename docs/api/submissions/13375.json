When he said his mom is a recovering alcoholic, I was pretty sure.\n\nHe was traumatized by his mother's behavior when she was drinking. I think that's why he doesn't drink - so he never, ever does what she did. It's pretty common for children of alcoholics.\n\nHe needs help to heal from this because you, as a lay person, probably can't help him. You can support him, but he may have a lot of unpacking to do that is best done with a professional. There is also a support group called ACOA (Adult Children of Alcoholics) that could be very helpful to him.\n\nThat being said...NAH but you may need to compromise on the reception. You may be able to negotiate for beer & wine, but no hard liquor. But he may not be willing to budge. His mother knows that she is responsible for her own sobriety, but he doesn't trust her. He may never trust her.\n\nYou aren't having a rational disagreement about whether to serve alcohol at your reception. You have a healthy relationship to alcohol. He has a terror of it. *You* drinking doesn't really bother him - you aren't his mom. But it sounds as if he is terrified of the possibility of his mom drinking. That's a far deeper, existential fear, more akin to a phobia. There's no rational discussion to be had with a phobia.\n\nI strongly suggest ACOA and therapy for him, and possibly couples' therapy for both of you. I wish you the best of luck.", "NTA. Wanting alcohol at a wedding to loosen people up and have more fun does not make you an alcoholic. Those comments are giving holier-than-thou, pick me energy. There is nuance to things, which a lot of people seem to be forgetting here. There's a reason dry wedding receptions end early and often aren't as fun as people were hoping for. Yes, you can have fun without alcohol, but let's be realistic here. Drinking culture at weddings is pretty common and most people expect to be able to have drinks at a wedding. OP isn't TA (or an alcoholic) just because they want to have a few at their wedding.\n\nThis is not something he can just spring on you. He should have mentioned this way ahead of time. I get that he has trauma, but he needs to be able to be open with his life partner, especially about important things like that. Drinking culture is huge at weddings and that should have been something he brought up wayyyyyyyyyy ahead of time, not late enough in the game that you've already hired the wedding planner.\n\nHonestly a good compromise might be a cash bar. There's a lot less drinking at a wedding when guests have to pay for it. You could also do low-percentage drinks instead, like beers and seltzers.\n\nETA: dry weddings can be great and are totally cool, but they definitely need to be discussed ahead of time. You can't just spring that on your spouse last minute, especially when they never even knew there was an alcohol issue in the family in the first place because he refused to disclose it.", "NAH.

On the same token, you sound like you have a problem with alcohol if you think a dry wedding won't be fun.  We have attended dry weddings before, and still had a good time.  Being drunk is not the be all and end all.  \n\nI'm not judging either way, there sounds like too many problems on both sides here.", "i think yall need to rethink this. you both place very different values on alcohol that are already starting the cause problems for you.", "\"I feel like he is only thinking about himself\"\n\nSounds like this applies to both of you. Probably NAH.", "NTA \n\nHe sprung that on you with no warning at a meeting with your wedding planner and ultimately his mom\u2019s sobriety is her responsibility.\n\nHis response does make me wonder if he\u2019s had his own problematic relationship with alcohol", "Nobody is an AH here but when I read he doesn\u2019t drink I thought immediately there was probably an alcoholic parent in the story. I bet his mom\u2019s addiction really screwed him up. He\u2019s scared not being a jerk. \n\nNow, I\u2019m not suggesting you go baby him thinking he will just open up. That might piss him off. I\u2019d take the approach of understanding how he feels and that he must be nervous she will be too tempted and fall off the wagon. Then tell him that you know your family and friends. They haven\u2019t dealt with the same issues so alcohol is a big deal when there is a big celebration. Most people are unlike him and a wedding without alcohol will be extremely boring. Yes, they will enjoy the ceremony but the reception will be far less enjoyable because most people won\u2019t let loose. \n\nThen ask if there is a way for both of you to come up with a solution so his mom stays sober and the rest of the guest if they do choose can have a lot of fun. Maybe if there\u2019s room there can be a bar separate with alcohol and one just for other drinks. You can tell the bartenders with the alcohol on the sly to not serve her. \n\nA marriage is going to be a lot of disagreements and the successful ones find solutions and compromise. If it\u2019s about winning both lose every time.", "NTA. It could be an ESH or NAH if he would actually communicate. \n\nWhat the hell is wrong with this sub and its weird puritanical views on alcohol? How do so many of you make the jump from \"I don't want a dry wedding/there is normally aclohol at Big family events\" to \"we are all alcoholics who want to get blind drunk\". Is this a US thing? \n\nAlcohol can be a great social lubricant at these sorts of events, it can help with small talk, getting out on the dance floor, and generally being more sociable on general.", "I have no stance on this couple but expect a dry wedding to be short unless the guests are teetotalers.\n\nNot because \"people can't spend one measly evening sober.\" But because guests not in the inner circle will be subject to long stretches of boredom. Stuck at the venue for hours, among lots of strangers. IOW cut off from the usual ways to amuse yourselves without drinking. Alcohol does help break the ice. I say this as someone who doesn't GAF for myself, but only upon attending a long, dry wedding with a large guest list did this really hit me - and I was unable to drink at the time either way for medical reasons! I was gonna be dry for a couple of weeks no matter where I was.

He knows that it wouldn\u2019t be fair to make other people not do something because of his own problem.\n\nAnd I really hate all the comments from people saying stuff along the lines of \u201cif you need alcohol to have fun then you have a drinking problem\u201d. Like, no, not necessarily. The people saying that stuff sound so judgmental and pretentious as all get out. I don\u2019t have fun at events with lots of people if I can\u2019t drink because I\u2019m incredibly socially anxious. Having a couple drinks takes the edge off and allows me to actually talk to everyone and relax instead of only talking to the people I know incredibly well and worrying about what everyone thinks of me.

All I needed was love and I knew that deep down, yet all my actions pushed people away and I couldn\u2019t work out why because this was how my parents had gone on, was it not normal? Looking back I was manipulative, I was rude, I was condescending and quite frankly an awful partner. Did I hit and insult my partner? No. But was I a true nightmare to be around? Yes. Was I abusive? I\u2019d say borderline. I was argumentative, stand offish, gave silent treatments etc, I was also abusive towards myself with alcohol.

If I hadn\u2019t of became aware of them, I would have carried on behaving that way and I needed to heal to be a better partner. Keeping everything locked away from those that love you DOES NOT HELP. And so if he can\u2019t confide in her, then yes, chances are it may become abusive and ultimately end anyways. \n\nMy point is just because you are a trauma victim, do not think you are always in the victim category. People think this gives them free reign to be an arsehole and perpetuate the behaviour and low and behold! More trauma victims. Take responsibility for your trauma, heal and be better. Yes it was never your fault but just like a dog who takes a dump in the kitchen, you\u2019ve gotta clean it up and take care of the problem.\n\nIt\u2019s ignorant to completely dismiss the statement \u201cTrauma victims CAN be dangerous\u201d as if you look at the evidence a lot of dangerous people are trauma victims.
