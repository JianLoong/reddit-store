When he said his mom is a recovering alcoholic, I was pretty sure.\n\nHe was traumatized by his mother's behavior when she was drinking. I think that's why he doesn't drink - so he never, ever does what she did. It's pretty common for children of alcoholics.\n\nHe needs help to heal from this because you, as a lay person, probably can't help him. You can support him, but he may have a lot of unpacking to do that is best done with a professional. There is also a support group called ACOA (Adult Children of Alcoholics) that could be very helpful to him.\n\nThat being said...NAH but you may need to compromise on the reception. You may be able to negotiate for beer & wine, but no hard liquor. But he may not be willing to budge. His mother knows that she is responsible for her own sobriety, but he doesn't trust her. He may never trust her.\n\nYou aren't having a rational disagreement about whether to serve alcohol at your reception. You have a healthy relationship to alcohol. He has a terror of it. *You* drinking doesn't really bother him - you aren't his mom. But it sounds as if he is terrified of the possibility of his mom drinking. That's a far deeper, existential fear, more akin to a phobia. There's no rational discussion to be had with a phobia.\n\nI strongly suggest ACOA and therapy for him, and possibly couples' therapy for both of you. I wish you the best of luck.", "NTA. Wanting alcohol at a wedding to loosen people up and have more fun does not make you an alcoholic. Those comments are giving holier-than-thou, pick me energy. There is nuance to things, which a lot of people seem to be forgetting here. There's a reason dry wedding receptions end early and often aren't as fun as people were hoping for. Yes, you can have fun without alcohol, but let's be realistic here. Drinking culture at weddings is pretty common and most people expect to be able to have drinks at a wedding. OP isn't TA (or an alcoholic) just because they want to have a few at their wedding.\n\nThis is not something he can just spring on you. He should have mentioned this way ahead of time. I get that he has trauma, but he needs to be able to be open with his life partner, especially about important things like that. Drinking culture is huge at weddings and that should have been something he brought up wayyyyyyyyyy ahead of time, not late enough in the game that you've already hired the wedding planner.\n\nHonestly a good compromise might be a cash bar. There's a lot less drinking at a wedding when guests have to pay for it. You could also do low-percentage drinks instead, like beers and seltzers.\n\nETA: dry weddings can be great and are totally cool, but they definitely need to be discussed ahead of time. You can't just spring that on your spouse last minute, especially when they never even knew there was an alcohol issue in the family in the first place because he refused to disclose it.", "NAH.

On the same token, you sound like you have a problem with alcohol if you think a dry wedding won't be fun.  We have attended dry weddings before, and still had a good time.  Being drunk is not the be all and end all.  \n\nI'm not judging either way, there sounds like too many problems on both sides here.", "i think yall need to rethink this. you both place very different values on alcohol that are already starting the cause problems for you.", "\"I feel like he is only thinking about himself\"\n\nSounds like this applies to both of you. Probably NAH.", "NTA \n\nHe sprung that on you with no warning at a meeting with your wedding planner and ultimately his mom\u2019s sobriety is her responsibility.\n\nHis response does make me wonder if he\u2019s had his own problematic relationship with alcohol", "Nobody is an AH here but when I read he doesn\u2019t drink I thought immediately there was probably an alcoholic parent in the story. I bet his mom\u2019s addiction really screwed him up. He\u2019s scared not being a jerk. \n\nNow, I\u2019m not suggesting you go baby him thinking he will just open up. That might piss him off. I\u2019d take the approach of understanding how he feels and that he must be nervous she will be too tempted and fall off the wagon. Then tell him that you know your family and friends. They haven\u2019t dealt with the same issues so alcohol is a big deal when there is a big celebration. Most people are unlike him and a wedding without alcohol will be extremely boring. Yes, they will enjoy the ceremony but the reception will be far less enjoyable because most people won\u2019t let loose. \n\nThen ask if there is a way for both of you to come up with a solution so his mom stays sober and the rest of the guest if they do choose can have a lot of fun. Maybe if there\u2019s room there can be a bar separate with alcohol and one just for other drinks. You can tell the bartenders with the alcohol on the sly to not serve her. \n\nA marriage is going to be a lot of disagreements and the successful ones find solutions and compromise. If it\u2019s about winning both lose every time.", "NTA. It could be an ESH or NAH if he would actually communicate. \n\nWhat the hell is wrong with this sub and its weird puritanical views on alcohol? How do so many of you make the jump from \"I don't want a dry wedding/there is normally aclohol at Big family events\" to \"we are all alcoholics who want to get blind drunk\". Is this a US thing? \n\nAlcohol can be a great social lubricant at these sorts of events, it can help with small talk, getting out on the dance floor, and generally being more sociable on general.", "I have no stance on this couple but expect a dry wedding to be short unless the guests are teetotalers.\n\nNot because \"people can't spend one measly evening sober.\" But because guests not in the inner circle will be subject to long stretches of boredom. Stuck at the venue for hours, among lots of strangers. IOW cut off from the usual ways to amuse yourselves without drinking. Alcohol does help break the ice. I say this as someone who doesn't GAF for myself, but only upon attending a long, dry wedding with a large guest list did this really hit me - and I was unable to drink at the time either way for medical reasons! I was gonna be dry for a couple of weeks no matter where I was.

He knows that it wouldn\u2019t be fair to make other people not do something because of his own problem.\n\nAnd I really hate all the comments from people saying stuff along the lines of \u201cif you need alcohol to have fun then you have a drinking problem\u201d. Like, no, not necessarily. The people saying that stuff sound so judgmental and pretentious as all get out. I don\u2019t have fun at events with lots of people if I can\u2019t drink because I\u2019m incredibly socially anxious. Having a couple drinks takes the edge off and allows me to actually talk to everyone and relax instead of only talking to the people I know incredibly well and worrying about what everyone thinks of me.

If I hadn\u2019t of became aware of them, I would have carried on behaving that way and I needed to heal to be a better partner. Keeping everything locked away from those that love you DOES NOT HELP. And so if he can\u2019t confide in her, then yes, chances are it may become abusive and ultimately end anyways. \n\nMy point is just because you are a trauma victim, do not think you are always in the victim category. People think this gives them free reign to be an arsehole and perpetuate the behaviour and low and behold! More trauma victims. Take responsibility for your trauma, heal and be better.

Make sure guest (especially on your side) are aware that it's a low alcohol event and you will be displeased if they get wasted or bring outside alcohol.

In the same way that he can't dictate having no alcohol, you can't dictate having it. You could do something like a 1-2 drink limit per person as a compromise? I haven't seen that at weddings but i have seen it at loads of other events. \n\nPersonally I will not have alcohol at my wedding. Neither of us drink and both of our families get unruly when alcohol is involved. I don't want that at our wedding.\n\nIs it possible that some of his extended family is like that, or, like me he watched family get wasted constantly and it left a bad taste in his mouth?", "YTA. guy is probably traumatised from having an alcoholic parent but you care more about having fun at the wedding than accommodating for his trauma. why marry him (or anybody) anyway if you\u2019re going to be this selfish?", "NTA.

My fianc\u00e9 and I are getting married and he also doesn't drink, but my family are all very very big drinkers. Lol so I kind of have a similar situation to yours. I wanted to have alcohol at my wedding for my family's sake and also the fact that I like to drink socially and a wedding is something to be celebrated. However, the wedding is not just my day No matter how many people keep telling me \"It's your day as the bride\" lol. I want my fianc\u00e9 to be comfortable on his wedding day and show him that I will be the one to have his back no matter what. He is a person that I have a deep respect for because he is true to his character and is honest, and I want to show up for him and meet his needs. He is uncomfortable around alcohol, so there won't be any. If my family has a problem with it, sucks to be them lol.

Your situation sounds a bit different than mine just because of the history of alcoholism on his family's side. I have an alcoholic older brother, but I wasn't planning on inviting him for reasons outside his condition. \n\nI think that you guys can probably come together to form a compromise? Like maybe not alcohol during the wedding but have some at the reception. Or maybe you can have your family take you out the day before and celebrate during that time?

Is it a crazy fun, rambunctious but VERY drunk time?  Do you think they will be able or willing to tone it down?\n\nBecause based on how you wrote this, I have the feeling it's not the mere PRESENCE of alcohol that's the problem, it's A. subjecting your FMIL to a bunch of drunken shenanigans, making HER unable to celebrate her son, and B. subjecting your husband to the same thing, which may ALSO make him uncomfortable since he grew up with an alcoholic, and maybe he went along with your family before without saying anything, but wants to enjoy HIS wedding too.  I could be wrong, and it's all in moderation, but we need more info.\n\nI won't go so far as to call you the AH, but you both need to communicate, and I have the feeling the \"fun family drinking\" is the problem.

That's kind of a shitty thing to say IMO. You can have fun without it if it's something you really want to do.

Do you want your husband to be anxious the entire wedding day because his mum may be triggered into a relapse? \n\nYou two should have a long conversation about this. It sounds like he has been affected by his mum's addiction, and that WILL play a role if and when you decide to have kids. Children of addicted parents often will not bring up their kids around substances, and there is a good chance he won't feel comfortable with you drinking around any future kids. This may not seem fair to you but it's a harsh reality.", "NTA honey delay the wedding, your fiance conceals very important information, makes decisions without your input and no reasons given, until pressed, then starts being very passive aggressive.

Probably NAH or ESH or something in-between. I mean, his mum alcoholism probably traumatized him, or he is an ex alcoholic as well.

Your family cannot have a good time at the reception without alcohol? The implication seems to be that you think it's OK to force your husband's alcoholic mother to hang around a bunch of drunk people who won't have a good time unless they're drunk. Those are the kind of folks who pressure sober alcoholics to \"just have one drink, it's a special occasion!\"\n\nYou say your future MIL has fantastic self-control, and you've decided it's OK to test that. Maybe she has that control by avoiding situations like a bunch of drunk folks celebrating. Maybe she avoids situations where she would be tempted to drink. \n\nIt doesn't matter.

Yes, he has a valid reason considering he might be traumatized by his mother during his childhood. But he just made the no-alcohol call to your planner without discussing with you. You, at least, we\u2019re communicating with him when the planner left instead of contradicting him to her. \n\nYour feelings are valid as well as his.

If you have never lived with an alcoholic, or haven't been one yourself, you wouldn't understand. It's not just about self control. It's a daily struggle to stay sober. The fact that you said your family is big on drinking makes me think you were probably around alcoholics your whole life, and don't realize it, or it seems acceptable to you.

I get that maybe he wanted to keep his mum's privacy, but it's unfair to make big decisions about a shared thing like the wedding without making clear why. He acted like he was neutral about alcohol, but he actually has very strong feelings about it, as well as likely a lot of trauma. The difficult thing is, if he can't be honest about this, what other trauma may come out of his seemingly innocuous preferences?\n\nI rarely drink, my fiance rarely drinks, I don't see an alcohol free wedding as the worst thing in the world. But I see it as a much bigger issue that he wasn't able to discuss why until he felt forced to, and still isn't happy to confront this issue. It sounds like he needs therapy. \n\nThe difficulty here is there is no easy compromise.

It comes out in nasty ways, eventually. I get that your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t want to retraumatize his mom, which in turn might retraumatize him, but that isn\u2019t on you or your wedding guests to sort out. It\u2019s up to her to deal with in post-recovery therapy, and for him to separately deal with in his own therapy program. \n\nNow, had he discussed this with you before unilaterally deciding to ban alcohol and have a dry wedding, maybe some sort of compromise or concession could have been made. But he doesn\u2019t just get to make a decision as big as whether to allow alcohol and blindside you in front of a wedding planner y\u2019all have already paid for without any sort of explanation. and as awful and traumatic as alcoholism for both the sufferer and their families, that doesn\u2019t give you the right to make decisions for *an entire wedding* because of ONE person. I\u2019m a recovering addict with some very difficult mental illnesses and there are certain situations that are incredibly triggering for me\u2026I simply avoid them or I rely on tactics I learned in therapy to deal. It\u2019s no one else\u2019s problem but mine. And I\u2019ve very clearly communicated to my partner about them so if I do need to leave a venue early, or step outside to take a breather, he\u2019s aware of what\u2019s going on.
