I\u2019ll use fake names for privacy reasons.  Kate23, Sam and Eric 24, Loise 19 me and Haley 17. This story may seem fake but I genuinely am thinking about getting restraining orders. I\u2019m looking for judgement only so please focus on that.It may seem irrelevant but I\u2019m gonna explain who things started. Growing up I had a dysfunctional family.It would take one thing like my father getting fired and him lashing out on all of us to start a big fight. I was the only one who didn\u2019t participate in the arguments and just kept to myself. At 15 I started working while all my other siblings didn\u2019t and I kept it a secret 2months into my job my entire family showed up and started screaming about how I was a \u201cselfish kid who didn\u2019t give back to the family by hiding my money and buying myself things\u201d. I got fired after the second time they caused an incident. To think they didn\u2019t care about where I went every other day for 6 hours.\nMy mom came home with an angry look on her face and she screamed about the fact that we were behind on rent to my dad. He yelled back at her and then my siblings got involved. Things got so bad that my grandparents had to step in and said that they would take one child away from the house to lessen the financial burden and help us out. They told use to vote and I was shocked they all picked me. I was both upset and happy I was leaving. That was all 2 years ago.Now I work two jobs to save up for a good school and my grandparents who are the nicest people I\u2019ve met. At my work place I sustained severe burns after I slipped in front of a fryer. The company I was working with was very persistent on me not pressing charges and my grandparents urged me to settle for an amount of money (around 250k) I\u2019m still working at that job. All the money is with my grandparents who haven\u2019t touched any and waited for my birthday in a couple months. My aunt who was visiting asked why I had some scars on my neck and upper back. I explained the incident to her and didn\u2019t think about it after that. My entire family came to my grandparents door 2 days later and they acted like we were friends. They started a conversation and it eventually shifted into the them asking for 45K for something\u2019s and they said that it was nice the family had some good money saved.  I laughed and said that money belonged to me and that they weren\u2019t getting any of it. The started the loud arguing and it brought back memories of the toxic environment. I locked myself in my room and called the police while they banged on my door and yelled at me. I called my grandparents who quickly came with the police and escorted them out. My mom said I was a problem child who never made her happy. My siblings sent me insults and threats but I screenshotted all of it and ignored them. A couple aunts called me a brat. The whole family is doing a get together this Friday and I\u2019m worried about what\u2019s gonna happen.

This is your money to compensate you for your injury and pain.  They are not entitled to any of it.  Obviously, don't go to the get together and if possible plan to staying with a friend or someplace they won't know to find you.  Be prepared to call the police if necessary.  Hopefully you believe you grandparents will protect both you and your money.", "NTA. That money is yours for any suffering and medical treatments required because of your accident. It\u2019s not a windfall for people you haven\u2019t seen for years", "NTA\n\nKeep your money.  Thank goodness your grandparents are not as greedy as them.   Put that money into an investment account and let it be a part of your retirement.  Keep on working and ignore their laziness.", "NTA. That money was compensation for your injuries. Where was there concern for you when you were injured? Did they show up and look after you? They care for you as an ATM OP. You should go low or no contact with them and continue your positive relationship with your Grandparents. Take care and good luck.", "NTA, please get restraining orders. They won\u2019t stop trying to get your money until the can\u2019t.", "NTA\n\nTheir financial problems are not yours. With their vote, they made it obvious that they don't want anything to do with you....until they suddenly see an opportunity for themselves.  That settlement is yours, not theirs.", "When you were 15 your siblings were 17 and 19 and they weren't working at all? If the whole family is supposed to \"share money\", then why weren't your parents pushing your older siblings to work?\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \nIt\u2019s not your fault your grandparents furniture was broken, that was cos your family members are violent and sound a bit crazy\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 and that money was given to you as compensation for your injuries not them. Maybe if they hadn\u2019t literally voted you out of the house it\u2019s be a different story but at this point defo keep the money", "NTA...Other people's financial decisions are not your problem.

Your family just sees you as a cash cow and they don't seem to care the least about you.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t go to the get together, it may be better to sit this one out.", "NTA.  And DO NOT got to that \"family\" get together.  Your family are your grandparents who are the only ones that care about YOU and not your money.  Stay away from those toxic, greedy AHs that unfortunately are your parents and siblings.", "NTA and don't talk about the money anymore. I'd literally fake being financially irresponsible and tell them you lost it all day trading or something. When you turn 18, open a bank account at a completely different bank than you've had, and preferably get only online statements", "NTA.\n\nWhat if you tell them that you will match the amount your siblings contributed to the family while you were 15.  Oh, they contributed $0?  Therefore, you will give them $0.  This is probably an AH move, but sometimes you need to be an AH to get your point across.", "NTA but also I really hope your grandparents safeguard that money for you. I would invest it ASAP as that could become an amazing retirement for you someday and you're financially in a really good position to help you later in life.\n\nMy concern is that legally your family could be entitled to access the money if you're not legally an adult yet.

Move as far away from these leeches as you can and go no contact.

It is not meant to be a winning lottery ticket for the family that does not care for or respect you.", "NTA at all.  You removed yourself from a very toxic relationship and bravo to you for taking that step, that was courageous and smart.  You owe your family zero, if anything they owe you for all the crap you had to endure.  The only people you do owe is your grandparents who seem like very loving and compassionate people, please don't forget them in this.  I would go ahead and get those RO's immediately just for the most recent incident.  Go total NC with the rest of the family.  They are slimy leeches who dwell in the mud that want to bring you down to their level, don't let them.  Walk away and prosper and don't look back.", "NTA - you can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family. However, you can CHOOSE whether to be with your family or not. Sounds like yours are a little greedy and self-centered while you have a good work ethic.\n\nMay I suggest utilizing some of your settlement monies for bettering yourself via education. Whether that is a trade education or higher education is a personal decision. But choose wisely based upon your own aptitudes and what you want to do. You may even decide to move somewhere else once you are an adult and make a new life for yourself.\n\nDon't forget to help out those who helped you though once you are able though. Something nice that your grandparents NEED would be very generous since they have been raising you.\n\nGood luck.", "Please don't worry about what's going to happen because you've done nothing wrong.

I'm glad you're away from your toxic family.\n\nYou did well to start working to better yourself. As a minor child it isn't your job to support your family.\n\nDon't give them anything.", "NTA. Please transfer that money to an account you only have access too.", "NTA! It sounds like you may have got voted off the island into a better living & loving situation. That's YOUR money for YOUR pain and suffering. You didn't do anything wrong by refusing it to them. Stick to your guns, and don't let them try to emotionally or physically abuse you into doing something you don't want to.", "NTA - go get that restraining order and never look back.", "INFO: How long until you are 18? Are your grandparents your legal guardians? You need a lawyer, OP to set up a will, power of attorney, etc... Stat. I fear for your safety.", "NTA.  I know you trust your grandparents but you need to put that money somewhere that only you have access. You never know if your family is somehow going to get access fraudulently, no matter how careful your grandparents are. Get your own accounts. Tell no one the passwords, not even your grandparents.", "YTA to yourself if you go to this family gathering. You know they just want your money.  Why are you doing this to yourself?", "Happy Cake day!", "And make sure you designate someone who has medical authorization for you in case you get incapacitated, probably your grandparents, and to make a will that gives your money to anyone but those greedy family members. If you don't, your parents are your next of kin may get to make decisions about your health, life, and finances. Not to scare you, but what if you're in a coma and they decide to pull the plug so they can inherit your money?", "Found the dad or mom."]}
