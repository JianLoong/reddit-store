I promise they won't be here then.\" To persist that you must have the whole family together to play nice for your own satisfaction is selfish.\n\nAnd before anyone says, \"Well mom doesn't know OP isn't coming because of the cheaters, she's being dishonest and blaming work.\" If my mother were so dense about the situation to truly believe that, I would still feel the same way about her and not want to see her", "It really comes down to the fact that the parents accept the cheating couple\u2019s behaviour or they reject it\u2026. And they are accepting it\u2026. OP should stay away\u2026", "The kids are innocent. Why should they be deprived of half their grandparents because their parents suck? They didn't get to choose their family.", ">Why does mom continue to invite OP to events where they'd both be present, forcing OP to decline every time? \n\nCome on, what mom isn't going to send a Thanksgiving invite to her estranged daughter she desperately wants to see? \n\n>It does not hurt the grandchildren to say, \"We're going to have to do family Christmas early/late the year because grampa and I are going away for Christmas!\" and then go to visit OP.\n\nAnd we're back to the part where someone asked OP why she doesn't meet up with her parents for a small vacay and she said she doesn't want to be reminded and wishes she could erase all her memories leading up to 10 years ago", "They didn't accept the \"behavior \". They still love the daughter,  and now they have a grandchild in the equation.  Think, as a parent,  what you would jave done had this happened to your children, both of whom you loved very much. one d8d a very shitty thing, but would you cut her off just like that, especially of theres a grandchild involved? \n\nI get that everyone wants to be offended on OPs behalf, and that perfectly fine, I am.too.  However  BECAUSE OP MISSES HER MOM, as stated, and her mom has repeatedly reached out to her, I am merely suggesting that perhaps that some room for OP to maintain some sort of relationship with her folks IF SHE WANTS.", ">what mom isn't going to send a Thanksgiving invite to her estranged daughter she desperately wants to see? \n\nMothers with brains and empathy, mostly. At least the invite shouldn't come without the caveat of, \"I totally understand if you don't want to come, but maybe we could work out another time.\" Sounds like mom just invites her and is upset when she chooses to work instead. But why should she be surprised?\n\n>we're back to the part where someone asked OP why she doesn't meet up with her parents for a small vacay and she said she doesn't want to be reminded and wishes she could erase the past 10 years\n\nMaybe it's because we don't have enough info on exactly what mom's actions have been over the past 10 years, but I read it as \"mom decided to forgive sister and ex because of the children and doesn't understand or respect that OP can't/won't\". People are asking OP why she doesn't invite her parents on trips, but did the parents ever ask for visits with her outside of full family events?"]}
