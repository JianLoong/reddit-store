I tell her I don\u2019t know.  Well she and my dad are getting up there in years and they want a family celebration with everyone.  Including my cheat of an ex and his family.  \n\nShe just asked when I\u2019m going to be here for thanksgiving and I told her that work got in the way.  She broke down crying over the phone and pleaded with me to put in a time off request so I can see her.  My other FA family thinks I should do this one thing because it\u2019s not healthy to put work over family.\n\nHonestly, I can\u2019t stand to see my ex happy with his affair partner and what could have been us.

You will not be in the same room as the two persons who betrayed you the most, you won\u2019t see their kids or be their aunt but if they want to accept that, you can do a diner once in a while ? Maybe share the hollidays ? Try that once and see how it goes. If they can\u2019t accept , at least you tried but as of right now it seems that your relationship is frozen in this ugly moment from 10 years ago. You can build a new one.", "ESH.  NTA for not wanting to see your sister and avoiding any family celebrations where you\u2019d see her. But YTA for cutting out your parents for something they didn\u2019t do to you. Your sister is an AH and you stated your parents didn\u2019t attend her wedding (and rightfully so), but your sister has their only grandchildren to date and have a relationship with her solely for those kids sakes. So you\u2019re punishing your parents for something someone else did to you? Makes  you TA in that regard and trust me when I say this, you\u2019ll end up regretting that decision when it\u2019s too late", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
