Our daughter recently turned 16. For her birthday, she was getting a vehicle. She had been learning to drive with my 2010 Nissan Titan while she held her permit. I was gifting her the truck, it was twofold actually. I had been wanting to get a Silverado, she needed a vehicle. The day before her birthday, I had the truck professionally detailed in and out. I take the upmost care of my vehicles, both cosmetically and mechanically. The truck looks brand new practically. \n\nOn her birthday, I took her to the DMV. She thought we were there to do her road test and get her license. After she passed, I pulled the Titan\u2019s title out and said Happy Birthday! That\u2019s when she pretty much made an embarrassing scene because OMG I\u2019M NOT DRIVING A GRANDPA TRUCK DADDDDD. I\u2019m 39 for the record. She threw a tantrum because she wanted a blue Jeep Wrangler. We walked out momentarily to speak, I wanted her to know exactly how rude her behavior was when her father was giving her a truck any other 16 year old would be extremely grateful for. \n\nEventually she apologized, but we had another hiccup when I told her she\u2019ll get full access to it when I get another truck which was already in the works, I was just waiting on the bank to close the loan. Ultimately, I told her to forget it. She was just acting like a spoiled brat. Later that night, I suppose she thought about her behavior as she began asking questions then said she realized how immature she acted. She asks, \u201cSo since you were gonna sign it over to me, does that mean I could drive it for a bit, sell it and then put the money towards a Wrangler?\u201d\n\nMy response was, of course you could have. By me signing the vehicle over to you, it was officially yours to do what you\u2019d like with it. She says, \u201cOh. Ok, well I\u2019ve thought about it and I would like to have it.\u201d Nerp. Doesn\u2019t work that way, you gone lost your opportunity girly. She totally flipped out, said I should have told her at the DMV she could sell it and keep the money. She told her mother I was being totally unfair. My wife agreed to her not getting the truck (probably cause she didn\u2019t want me buying a brand new Silverado\u2026insert eye roll). \n\nThe next day, she very sweetly asked for the truck again and then hinted around about me finally getting a Silverado. I didn\u2019t say anything. I went in my office, printed out a McDonald\u2019s employment application. I stuck it in an envelope, handed it to her. She was ecstatic, probably thinking it was the title. She opened it and said\u2026.YOU SUCK. I told her, if you want a Wrangler\u2026GET JOB. My wife said I was an idiot, I took it way too far. Maybe so, but I\u2019ve realized our child needs to learn not only the value of a dollar, but also needs to learn how to be grateful in life. \n\nIt sucks this happened, since it was part of her birthday. I didn\u2019t anticipate this type of behavior. It was upsetting, I felt like she slung crap at me.

Sounds like she needs to learn money doesnt grow on trees.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t look a gift horse in the mouth", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is acting entitled and selfish. Yes, most 16 yr olds would be thrilled to have any vehicle given to them. She doesn't deserve that gift. I agree with giving her a job application. \n\nI assume you would have paid for insurance and gas money if she was grateful. Now she can earn the money to buy her own car. It's gonna be a long time before she has enough for a Jeep Wrangler, lol. You're teaching a valuable lesson.", "NTA. You gave her a gift and she rejected it as it wasn\u2019t exactly what she wanted.

And, to me, it doesn't sound as if she has learned much other than trying to figure out an angle to work to get what she wants. NTA but perhaps you could match what she earns towards a used Wrangler, up to a certain amount?   That way the narrative isn't all about how mean and cruel you are....", "NTA, she should have been grateful for getting a free vehicle. She blew the opportunity twice, and needs to learn the hard lessons about how much she\u2019d have to work to afford the gift you were giving her.", "NTA. Especially after she doubled down with her tantrums", "Mostly NTA.\n\nShe was being entitled and rude with a perfectly good gift that a lot of people never get so I get where you were going with that. Also if she has no job she can't afford to sell the truck to put it towards what she wants, it's also silly to put money into a car/truck at her age.\n\nBut I do feel like you acted out a bit more than necessary because you were butthurt over your truck being called a Grandpa Truck.", "NTa. That\u2019s entitled brat. There\u2019s plenty of people that wish that are handed a nice truck.", "NTA. Reality is hard for some. I personnaly would allow her to drive the grandpa mobile, but not sign it over to her until she has a significant amount saved up toward her Jeep as I imagine she will need more than what the Nissan brings.", "NTA.  You offered her a gift and she rejected it, essentially returning it to you.  Where you DID seem to\nmess up\u2014if I\u2019m understanding correctly- was in telling her after she apologized that it wasn\u2019t yet quite her as you didn\u2019t have your own truck yet.  Why tell her that if she no longer had the option of owning the truck?  If you accepted her apology and THEN told her she got the truck when your new one came through , what AGAIN changed that it\u2019s not her truck?  And why talk about her theoretically selling it if the gift is off the table?  That\u2019s just confusing.  So if she rejected the gift, you clarified that she turned it down and was free to buy something different with her own earnings, fine.  But be clear. You can\u2019t give it, take it, give it (after apology), take it (because you don\u2019t like her questions).

Don't ever fold on this, birthday or not!", "NTA, here's how I got my daughter to get a job. I stopped paying for her cell phone. It's amazing what kids will do when they want something to work like a phone. I don't know how much she thinks she's going to get out of your car that is now 13 years old. But was she planning on buying a 20-year-old Jeep? That's about all she'd get with the money unless of course you know she had a job like McDonald's. Your daughter came across as an entitled brat.... Would she have preferred the horse watch I got from my 16th birthday? So she needs to learn to be a lot more grateful. And mom needs to learn to back you up.", "NTA.

She had been learning to drive with my 2010 Nissan Titan while she held her permit. I was gifting her the truck,\n\nINFO: Did she know she was getting a vehicle for her birthday?

Your wife is an AH for encouraging your daughter acting like a spoiled brat. One of the best things you can do for your daughter, is have her get a job and pay for the gas and oil changes for the truck. \n\nI have seen way too many teenagers gifted vehicles and they don't take care of them. And if there is an accident, they expect an immediate replacement. I would also have some restrictions on her driving, because the 16 yr old brain is not the best at negotiating traffic and other cars.", "NTA and a great lesson to learn for her, better now than later.", "NTA", "So you used her getting her license as an excuse to get Yourself a new vehicle?", "NTA and your a great dad!!!!\n\nYour daughter needs to learn some accountability for her actions.\n\nI don't want another teenage girl growing up to be an entitled adult.\n\nYou get 10/10 dad stars from me good sir!", "INFO: Where do you live that you can sign the title of a vehicle over to a minor?", "nta. i would have given bidy parts for that truck at 16.  wow..great dad..", "NTA - dang teenagers suck, but that was a brat move for the daughter. Seriously got gifted a car and she basically said she hated it. That was her first reaction so you know it\u2019s real. It\u2019s a free car?!??!! The daughter needs a reality check for sure. Glad OP gave her one with the job application. Also super rude bratty to just go like oh I\u2019ll sell the truck and buy my wrangler. \n\nLol Wranglers are super pricey even used. Just checked and a 2010 Jeep Wrangler is around $16,000 to $20,000 after taxes. The daughter is definitely a bit of a space cadet.", "ESH - Are you forgetting this is a teenager you're raising? Yes, they have their moments. We all do as adults as you've clearly shown that here. Your daughter is definitely acting a bit spoiled, but she's also LEARNING how to be an adult. You flip-flopping on her like that is kinda fucked up. It's your job to teach her how to be a responsible adult. \n\nIf you wanted to not come across as an AH how about you try sitting down and telling her she should look into getting a job and HELP HER find places. Printing out a McDonald's app is a huge slap in the face. My parents screamed at me to get a job at 16, and I did it, but they also HELPED ME find stuff and supplied me with tons of resources so I could pick something that would benefit what I was looking for.\n\nShe is absolutely also bratty, but she's also a KID. A teenage KID. It astonishes me honestly how parents just think being a dick towards their kid is going to \"teach them a lesson\". \n\nYou could've 100% came at this way more maturely about it and she could use a reality check for sure. You both suck here.", "ESH. She should be grateful for any vehicle, but this behavior is a clear product of you and your wife\u2019s parenting and expectations. There are kids out there that would be overjoyed to be offered a truck/car. I wouldn\u2019t be joking about the application. You want a wrangler? Get a job. Actually you want to drive my truck or mom\u2019s car? Get. A. Job. Because you will be responsible for the gas you use.", "NTA at all! I hate I wasn\u2019t there to see it \ud83d\ude01", "I think we need to see the truck to confirm it's a grandpa truck /s.\n\nI'm not really a fan of being petty during conflict. It usually exacerbates the issue and the message could have been gotten across without literally handing her an application (especially since paper applications aren't really wildly popular anymore). Ultimately, NTA for not giving her the car, but you kinda suck for making parenting harder on your partner since your wife is also going to have to deal with the fallout of your unilateral pettiness.", "YTA for treating a McDonald's application like some sort of prank. It's an honest job, not a sick burn to get back at your daughter.", "Definitely not a grandpa truck. I think it\u2019s sexy. NTA your daughter will learn from this and come out better on the other side.", "ESH - but mostly you. \n\nYes, she reacted badly to getting a gift and shouldn't have whined about it. If you'd taken the vehicle away on that basis, I'd consider that fair. \n\nBut she then apologized \"eventually\" - by which you apparently mean later that day, so she pretty immediately realized she'd behaved badly. Even then, if you'd still said, \"No\", I'd consider it justified. But instead, you dangled the prospect of her still getting the truck in front of her, and jerked it away only once she'd decided she wanted it after all. That's not about teaching the value of gratitude. That's just spite. \n\nAnd she's right - you seem fully aware of what kind of vehicle she wanted, so why *didn't* you tell her in advance that she wasn't getting it? You could still have made the Titan a surprise and explained the whole \"drive it while you save up for your own car\" plan on the day. Were you maybe hyping up the idea of this awesome present a bit much and gotten her expectations up? Also - a car is always a generous gift, but it does take a bit of the shine off it knowing that the giver is using that as a reason to get themselves a new one. \n\nWhat it sounds like to me is that you wanted a delightedly grateful daughter who would tell you you're the best dad ever, *and* you'd get a new toy of your own. Instead she bruised your ego by saying you drive a \"grandpa truck\", so you've gone into full-blown pettiness.", "ESH, your kid is a brat but dangling stuff in front of her as an adult is pathetic. You shouldn\u2019t say she can have something then change your mind, when she is trying to show a change in behaviour and attitude. You also shouldn\u2019t give her things she believes will be exciting gifts that are actually a way of rebuking and mocking her.", "ESH. Yes, your daughter is very childish. I wonder who she gets that from? The overgrown sulky kid who wrote the post?", "You say \"of course you could have sold it\" like that's the most obvious thing in the world! But it's not! It's generally considered a significant etiquette faux pas to sell (or even get rid of) a gift!\n\nYou should have recognized this, and clarified that you were fine if she sold it when she initially expressed the desire that that's not what she wanted.\n\nGonna go with ESH, because your daughter shouldn't have insulted the vehicle just because she didn't like it, and dictating a specific vehicle she wants is pretty entitled, but come on. You're being pretty obtuse toward common social mores that your daughter was trying to respect as well.", "ESH. Your daughter needed a lesson, and this was probably the right thing to do. But I'm not especially convinced that you responded calmly and out of parental duty rather than simply freaking out because you were told that the thing you were driving was a 'grandpa car'.", "ESH. Kudos for not backing down *and* for giving daughter the job application. I do question one comment in your post, however. You didn't anticipate this kind of behavior? Really? You and your wife *created* this type of behavior by allowing certain amounts of leeway with what she did when she was younger. A lot of parents don't really get that part, so you're not alone there. You really do have to discipline a child *every single time* they act up, throw a tantrum, or do/say something unacceptable in your presence. Period. And here's the hard part. When you tell them \"Next time you do this I'm giving you X punishment\" you'd better pony up because you're essentially ensuring they'll have a next time so they can challenge your disciplinary tactics. If you say but don't do, they'll know they can do whatever they want. Unfortunately for you and wife, it's too late to do anything for your daughter. This sort of entitled behavior should've been nipped in the bud when she was 3, tops.", "NTA\n\nThat said, I think the mcdonalds application in the envelope was a bit dramatic and I kind of agree with your wife. She absolutely needs to learn to be grateful and the value of a dollar, but also how to handle conflict in respectful, mature ways.\n\nNot that she's handling it well, but she's clearly processing the situation and the decisions she's made and working through what that means. If you'd sat her down and said \"my decision is final, if you want the wrangler you're going to have to get a job\" and she kept bugging you I'd fully support the envelope gag, but it had only been like a day. Directly spelling out the state of things before you resort to mocking her is probably going to be a better way to help her learn from this and equip her to make better decisions in the future.\n\nAlso at the end of the day, a spoiled kid is the product of your and your wife's choices, I can respect that it was totally unexpected but that also makes me think that approaching this as an opportunity to provide guidance and to better understand why she reacted this way rather than moving straight to harsh reality might be a more productive route forward.", "NTA- She's an entitled brat and needs to learn a lesson about being grateful and enjoying what she has. I know you're upset about the \"grandpa truck\" comment, however, I think you're upset about the whole situation. You gave your daughter an amazing gift for her birthday and she acted immature(in public for that matter), and treated you with disrespect and basically crapped all over your good deed.", "YTA because your ego got hurt and you *re*acted rather than *acted* in a mature, calm fatherly way with a lesson on cause/effect and what options were on the table. \n\nPower moves are not lessons. They are punishment  called a lesson.", "All I see in this post are kids. Kids all around. \nSome kid doesn\u2019t land at 16 being out of touch with gratefulness out of the void heh? \n\nMaybe if father had spend less time looking at himself being great in his car\u2019s reflection when he lovingly made it shine he could have had time to parent this kid and have an actual healthy relationship with them.\n\nFor that, YTA", "I'm going to say ESH. You raised an entitled brat. That's on you. \n\nAlso, I can see where she gets her snobbishness from. You printed a McDonald's app for her like it's a lowly, beneath her kind of job.
