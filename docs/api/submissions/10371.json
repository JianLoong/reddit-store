They can often be extremely tight as well.

Her family is a little toxic and a lot of worth was placed on her appearance growing up which has led to her being insecure of any changes in her body.

However, my wife's family was constant pressuring her to put the faja on.

I asked my wife if she wanted me to sit them down and tell them to chill the fuck out but she said no. \n\nYesterday, I went shopping and I came home and my wife was having a heated argument with her mother. I don't understand Spanish that well but I still tried to intervene to ask what was wrong. My wife didn't tell me and she went to our room to cry. I sat with her for a while she said that she was being pressured to put the faja on otherwise her 'body would be ruined'. I won't lie, I saw red in that moment and after I made sure she was fine, I went to speak to her mother. I asked her politely at first to leave my wife alone about her body because it was making her insecure, but that got me laughed at, which I probably should've predicted because older people don't care about that stuff. We ended up arguing and I told her to leave my wife alone.\n\nShe left, and now I'm being bombarded with texts and calls calling me disrespectful of their culture and my wifes family. They're demanding that I apologize to MIL but I don't see where I went wrong.
