They can often be extremely tight as well.

Her family is a little toxic and a lot of worth was placed on her appearance growing up which has led to her being insecure of any changes in her body. She's told me many times that she was worried about how her body would be after the baby and about the pressure from her family to bounce back.\n\n I'm not even joking but in the hospital room, two hours after she pushed our fat son out, she was gifted an XS faja from her aunt.

However, my wife's family was constant pressuring her to put the faja on. She tried it on the third day, but she found it to be too tight and chose to wear a velcro abdominal wrap with light pressure instead. I asked my wife if she wanted me to sit them down and tell them to chill the fuck out but she said no. \n\nYesterday, I went shopping and I came home and my wife was having a heated argument with her mother. I don't understand Spanish that well but I still tried to intervene to ask what was wrong. My wife didn't tell me and she went to our room to cry. I sat with her for a while she said that she was being pressured to put the faja on otherwise her 'body would be ruined'. I won't lie, I saw red in that moment and after I made sure she was fine, I went to speak to her mother. I asked her politely at first to leave my wife alone about her body because it was making her insecure, but that got me laughed at, which I probably should've predicted because older people don't care about that stuff. We ended up arguing and I told her to leave my wife alone.\n\nShe left, and now I'm being bombarded with texts and calls calling me disrespectful of their culture and my wifes family. They're demanding that I apologize to MIL but I don't see where I went wrong. My mom said I should've have done anything without my wife explicitly asking me to but she was crying for Pete's sake, what was I supposed to do?

We have a pressure management system in our core, which has already been impacted by pregnancy and birth. If you cinch the wrap too tightly, the pressure has to go somewhere else, and the path of least resistance is your pelvic floor.

It's good to set these boundaries up as soon as possible, because next they are going to be telling you how to raise your son based off their culture.

The fact that they got her an XS is ludicrous. She just gave birth. It hurts her  (and probably makes it hard to breathe) and pressures her body making her feel uncomfortable while she is healing as Op states. \n\nThe whole argument, the gift and even her trying it on to just please her pushy mother is supremely detrimental to her physical and mental health. Doctors would be against it at this time for these reasons. \n\nThe family are not just asking her to hurt herself physically, but alluding to the fact that she has to immediately start thinking about her body shape the moment she gave birth instead of focusing on healing and bonding with her baby is putting and will put on an enormous mental strain on her.", "IMO OP is TA for just mashing it all together under the \"latina\" label. \n\nI mean, i dunno about US, but its mildly offensive when people assume its all the same, such as calling all south americans \"latino / latina\" while we dont even speak same language."]}
