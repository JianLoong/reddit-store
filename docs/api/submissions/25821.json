Evidence of neglect, or a serious injury/illness). In those cases, refer it higher and make a record of it. A student having their first period is not your responsibility to report in any way.\n\nI would recommend CC-ing your department head or deputy principal in this case.

Hopefully it\u2019s more expected/accepted now that girls get their period often in late or even mid elementary school. I started at 10 as did my mother and grandmother so figured that it was coming. That being said, I don\u2019t recall any products being available in the bathrooms or special consideration such as you mention for bathroom times. I do remember my dad informing my female 5th grade teacher that I was on my period when we were out on a field trip. I was mortified at the time but do appreciate that she made sure that I had everything I needed and that I was doing OK.", "I honestly hope that's the case because the alternative is grim for the little girl. Not all mother's are super period positive. Im aware of one mother who was angry that the child got a pad at school because she felt that her daughter should have been prepared and I guess punishment for not knowing the exact moment your period would start when you're 10 years old was bleeding through your pants in school.", "The struggle is real. My kid started her period in PE, first period, SWIM UNIT. She knew I was home 10 minutes away and off work that day. But she didn't call me. Realized between sex ed at school and prep at home she actually didn't need me at all. Just took care of it herself and told me when she got home.

Average age kids start menstruating is 12. Most parents think they have more time. Shit happens. Is this mom crazy for her reaction? Yeah.

I\u2019m going through the beginnings of this right now with my 10yo daughter.

Of course, I saw girls when I was 12, curled up on the bathroom floor, at school, crying because of cramps, so I thought cramps was a sign. Never got them. Was wearing white shorts when I got mine and thankfully had it at home, during Thanksgiving dinner. My foster mother was very nonchalant and unemotional about the whole thing.", "Some parents refuse to discuss important topics with their children.

I knew about puberty because of health class at school.", "I got mine at 11. Nobody told me. We watched a video the previous year at school, but it didn't show anything other than two girls at the store buying tampons and I had no reference for what those were or any of the terminology around them, so...\n\nI got pretty lucky that my first period was spotting.", "But she demonstrated her knowledge of what to do and what to even ask for herself.

My older sister and I had a female anatomy and puberty book, but that\u2019s about all the direction I got at home about it.

I have seen a few little wallet like designs that have two pockets for pads and a line of \"looped elastic\" (like pencil holders) for tampoons if she chooses to use them.

They\u2019ve apologized about the emotional abuse (neglect from my dad and parentification from my mom). So they\u2019ve owned up to their mistakes, where they always put their needs first, but their behaviour hasn\u2019t changed.
