Better to hear it from you first.", "NTA. You responded to the girls request in a kind and appropriate way. You had no way of knowing it was the girl\u2019s first period if she didn\u2019t choose to volunteer that information to you. \n\nIf anyone is TA here, it\u2019s the mother for a) not making sure here daughter had appropriate supplies for that situation, and b) expecting you to be a mind reader.", "NTA. You should not have to deal with this lack of respect and boundaries from the Mom. I would respond to the mother ccing the principal and even up the food chain this:\n\nDear Name,\n\nI understand that your daughter's first period must have come as a shock to you and perhaps you felt like you missed a moment with her. However, SHE seemed to have it under control and SHE seemed to feel confident in what she needed to do and how to handle it - to the point I had no idea this was her first cycle. You have done a fantasic job raising her to be a strong, resilient and independent young person and it showed in her confidence today.\n\nI want to make this clear - while I respect your desire to know this, I am not able nor willing to make phone calls like this unless the CHILD needs me to. Again, had your daughter shown any sign of distress I would have notified you, but she was confident and very independent in her desire to handle this age-appropriate milestone moment.\n\nHowever, I respect your desire for me not to provide her with period products in the future. Please make sure she has appropriate supplies in her backpack, otherwise I will plan to send her to he school nurse if the need arises.\n\nSincerely,\n\nName", "NTA. If the student doesn\u2019t tell you, how are you supposed to know? I would inform your principal before engaging any further with this parent just to be safe. She seems rather\u2026 unhinged.\n\nI can understand notifying a parent if you had more information, but just handing a student a pad? You didn\u2019t give medical advice. You didn\u2019t give her a tampon (some mothers are weird about them). You didn\u2019t give her any medication. There was nothing I can see you doing differently in this situation based on the info given.", "NTA\n\nWhat kind of handmaid's taley third world hellhole are you in?", "NTA at all.

What did the parent want you to do, allow the child to bleed through her clothing?  \n\nYou're in a cleft stick here.  The parent is demanding the child be kept ignorant, but you didn't know that; you knew you had a kid who needed a pad.  Cover your ass and tell the principal first.", "NTA are you supposed to police the students periods? How often are you supposed to call home? How were you to know it was her first. Nah.

Parents failed and are transferring blame onto you.\n\nBless you for taking care of this girl. Please continue regardless of what these two AHs are saying.", "NTA. The student didn't inform you that it was the first time, thus how would you have known? There is nothing wrong with providing your own personal products instead of making her go elsewhere. You handled the situation perfectly.", "NTA. I wonder what would happen if it was a male teacher. Would the mom expect him to keep track of the childs first period then... like wtf...", "NTA\n\nHaving gotten two girls through fifth grade, I never expected a teacher to call with that info. First time or not.", "What? How is it your fault that you didn\u2019t know it was her first and she acted nonchalantly about it and already knew what she needed? Nta, this mom is just crazy \ud83e\udd23", "The parent didn\u2019t accept your apology? What a jerk. NTA.", "I suggest you talk to the guidance counselor or principal/ vice principal.

The trauma the poor kid would have been in if you didn't give her anything at all.", "NTA. If my daughter gets her first period at school I pray she has a teacher who helps her out without embarrassing her the way you did. Also it sounds like the girl told her parents herself when she got home so I'm not sure what the issue is.", "NTA\nYou helped a student when they needed it, in a completely appropriate way. I don't see it as your job to pry into a student's business and question them if it's their first etc, and as you said she didn't indicate she needed help. The mother should be grateful her daughter has a teacher she feels comfortable enough approaching for help. I would've been thanking you for helping make it a more positive experience.", "NTA. Just one of a million reasons I quit teaching after almost 30 years.  The vast majority of people seem to believe that teaching is a customer service job.  No it isn\u2019t. Teachers are not their to make you happy. They\u2019re there to teach.", "NTA. Nope this is not your responsibility. Not even close.", "Absolutely NTA. If you did a single thing \u201cwrong,\u201d it was not send the student to the nurse and even then you\u2019re NTA for taking care of the problem. How would you possibly know that this was the girl\u2019s first period? Kick the entire incident up to your department head or the principal and don\u2019t continue engaging with the parents; this mom is weird af.", "NTA", "NTA. My daughter\u2019s middle school has sanitary products in the bathroom so the girls can have access to them without having to ask. What will mothers like that do in those situations? It\u2019s not your responsibility to notify parents in those situations. It\u2019s not an issue where a parent should be notified. I would let the principal know and not continue to engage with that parent.", "NTA - So strange to hear about something so innocuous like this being ranted about by some parents.  You can't even give an aspirin without running into problem.  Yet, for some giving out birth control, puberty blockers and take them to get abortions is just fine.  Can everyone make up their minds already either it is ok to give these out or not to students by the teachers?  To me there is no difference at all.

Probably a great outcome for the child. \n\nThe parent is being ridiculous.", "NTA  \n\n\nI worked in a Scottish high school - ages 11-18.  Over the years, have had a handful of cases where girls borrowed period products from me.  I think a couple might have been their first time.  Parents were only informed if the girl concerned needed to go home for a change of clothing.", "NTA. I get your reasoning completely. Would she rather you have let her bleed through where she was embarrassed? I guess you could have sent her to the school nurse but that wasn't a huge thing. Obviously her daughter let her know so I don't see what the Mom's issue is other than being on her period as well.", "Huh? NTA. Are you supposed to interrogate every girl about her period? That'd be so weird. Definitely let your boss know, though.", "NTA as a parent of teen girls, the only time I think I should be notified in a situation like this is if my kid is extremely distressed or needs clean clothes and didn't have a change in her bag.\nWith a parent like this, I think you may have had a problem no matter how you handled it.", "NTA. It was great that the mom had the girl prepared in knowing what was needed in case this happened, so slight kudos there. Unfortunately she only gave her the prep talk and not the \"here's an emergency kit\" sit down with her. You are not at fault for not telling her parent(s) as that should have been something she should have done. \n\"I need to go to the clinic to get a pad or call my parents\" \nThis is NOT on you. Parents (yes I am a parent to a 22 year old daughter who had an emergency pack in her backpack and twin almost 14 year old boys) \nIf if we're a medical emergency, that's still not up to you to be responsible to relay to the parents. That's honestly for the office to deal with.\nAgain, as a parent, I'd appreciate if the teacher informed me but in NO WAY would I be all sorts of upset that you didn't go above and beyond to make me aware. It's simply not in your job description and above your pay grade (damn near everything is, in all honesty) \n\nThere has only ever been 1 teacher that I have appreciated more than life and that's when my oldest twin was going through abuse. She made sure he felt safe and secure and could always go talk to him (still can 5 years later, she's THAT amazing!) Not saying you're not, in any way!

The mum is the weird one here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA on thinking about it, I reckon mum has been up in the daughters grill about it so much that a period is just normal to her. But mum obviously thinks its a huge deal and is disappointed her daughter didn't rush to her.", "My mom never told me anything about my period and acted like it was a personal affront to her when I started. Like it was too disgusting to be discussed. I had to deal with it alone. I\u2019d have been devastated had I talked to a teacher about needing supplies and that teacher then took it upon themself to tell my mother.  Sadly, there are still moms like mine out there. A teacher doesn\u2019t know what sort of response they\u2019d get if they call the parents. Or what sort of hell they may be raining down on the poor child. I\u2019d have done exactly what you did, OP. Give them what they need and move on, unless they expressly asked for help in some way. NTA", "NTA let the principal know. Also, products should be available in the bathrooms free of charge. It\u2019s essentially the same as toilet paper", "NTA but it might have been safer to send the student to the nurse. She might have been better trained to handle the situation. It\u2019s totally on mom that the student was unprepared.", "NTA. You weren't told it was her first one, so how were you supposed to notify them. Also, did they expect you just let her keep bleeding with no products until she got home, or if you called them, until they got there. You handled it well", "NTA...what would mom have said if you took the time to call her while that girl bled out all over her pants. Let the period teasing from other students begin. Then she's dealing with a traumatized daughter.", "Coming from a parent you are NTA. I would have been thankful that you didn't disclose that information without my daughter's consent and that you helped her in a time of need. In the future if you want to and are ever in a similar situation you can ask the student if they feel comfortable with their parent knowing.\n\nUnless it is legit life threatening or life endangering there is no need for a parent to know everything if the child doesn't expressly give their consent to notifying the parents.", "NTA. That girl\u2019s mother misspelled \u201cthank you for helping my daughter\u201d.", "NTA. However, it probably would have been advisable to send her to the nurse rather than give her your own pad. I would imagine that schools have protocols for things like this, and giving students any sort of hygiene product, and notifying parents.

Did she want OP to just let the poor girl bleed through her clothes??", "Happy cake day! \n\nFormer teacher here.  We never called parents, either, just handed out the pads or sent them to the nurse's office for a pad.  \n\nNTA. You responded appropriately.", "This message will definitely escalate the situation. I say this as an experienced teacher.
