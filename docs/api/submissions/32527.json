My mom\u2019s a teacher and starts getting ready at 5. \nThey have no door between their bedroom and bathroom, and my mother showers, blow dries her hair, and walks around on the wooden bedroom floor in heels. \nMy dad sleeps through all of it, or wakes up and says hello and how he loves her, and then goes back to sleep. Been doing it for 31 years.\nYour boyfriend is ridiculous. He can go back to sleep if he needs to, or even start waking up with you an hour and a half earlier.", "Nta your bf needs to learn that yall wake up at different times and that\u2019s ok", "NTA. Believe it or not, human beings tend to make noise as they go about their day. Accidentally or otherwise. People who expect the entire world around them to screech to a halt when they're sleeping irk me. Thats not how life works.", "Your bf sounds like a delicate flower, bless his little cotton socks.", "NtA, earplugs ,white noise/fan noise/rain noise", "NTA. I work 12 hour nights as a health care worker and my partner works 10 hour days in an oil refinery. We have kids and pets. I am woken up by random sounds all the time, sometimes caused by the family or sometimes caused by outside noises. The world doesn\u2019t stop just because I\u2019m sleeping. People make noise when they get ready. Waking up an hour earlier than you want to is a nuisance sometimes and don\u2019t get me wrong, I have been annoyed at times when people are being excessively loud in the house, but I move on, it\u2019s part of life. it sounds like you have been very accommodating. If he doesn\u2019t like living with someone who makes normal sounds, then he should live alone!", "NTA. Your boyfriend isn't a child, is he? To be woken up around 7 or 7:30 during the workweek isn't outreagous. Not everyone has the privilige to work from home and accordingly plan their days however they'd like. Tell him to use earplugs if he's so easily starled awake.", "NTA. My husband and I work opposite shifts. I get up at 7am when he goes to bed at 5am. \n\nI do everything I can to not wake him up but sometimes I do, normally he just gives me a sleepy hi, asks me for a kiss and rolls over. Honestly it one of my favourite moments. \n\nHe also told me that I often wake him up when I kiss him on the side of his head before I go to work but asked that I never stop because it makes him so happy. \n\nIf your partner is struggling with the fact you get up earlier then they need to put things in place to stop it from happening, not just you.", "Shit... AITA? My wife WFH and I get up at 5:45!", "NTA my girlfriend works 8-5 and is usually up at 6:30 while I work shifts away from home so I\u2019m normally woken up on my mornings off and it\u2019s never bothered me cause it\u2019s just not feasible really to be avoided.

I lived with someone who woke up at 6:00 am everyday when I didn't need to be up until 8. Yet I rarely heard his alarm go off. Our only tiff was him turning on the light that was next to my head and that only happened a couple times. \n\nAre you getting up and turning off the alarm or are you hitting snooze? Are you frequently making loud noises? If all your stuff is in another room for prep, what's falling? Are you banging around in the rest of the house? \n\nAlso how are you accidentally closing a door  that is loud enough that it wakes someone up?", "NTA. This is always gonna happen when living with someone. You are already really nice for getting changed in a different room", "NTA. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s 3am or something. 7/7.30 is a fairly reasonable time to be waking up.", "NTA. I get being annoyed but creating an argument over it is a bit much", "NTA. My gf wakes me up every morning at 6:30 when she gets ready for work. I don't mind it. I actually feel bad if I don't wake up. Because I want a kiss and wish her a good day, and perhaps have a short chat, a morning check-up on things. You bf is being an ass about it.", "ok, you could\u2019ve just remembered to take your smart watch out of the bathroom, but people in this comment section calling him a child and arrogant when you didn\u2019t even give details on how he reacted or what happened next is ridiculous", "YTA since his issues are directly caused by you, but to make sure similar issues doesnt happen in the future maybe you should sleep in different rooms, at least during work days?", "NTA. he needs to clue in that you aren\u2019t intentionally waking him up. And recognize what a privilege it is to not have to get up earlier for work to commute \u2026 AND he gets to sleep in so late.", "NTA. \n\nWorking from home doesn't mean you have the right to sleep however long you want to and expect the world to provide for you.\n\nIf you wake up, get up! You will be more tired in the evening and go to bed a bit earlier, making it more ok to wake up earlier the next day.\n\nI dont understand families who have different waking times when its not needed due to drastic differences in their work hours. There are people who go to bed at 4 and wake up at 10 when they have toddlers - letting their spouses do all the early morning activities with kids.\n\nThat is just not normal behaviour  - you live together - you wake up together - you go to sleep together.  Thats how you utilise your time together with your partner. Expecting someone to sneak around in the morning is ridiculous. Especially when there is no actual need for it.", "NTA.
