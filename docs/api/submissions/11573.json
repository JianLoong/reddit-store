Highlighting it in case the story is familiar.\n\nI've been married for 5 years. My wife is 29. I am 31. We have a beautiful 4-year-old girl and have handled parenthood greatly by being supportive of each other. I work from home. So, it made things easier for both. We really love each other.\n\nThe issue started when the first Mother's Day came around, it was something I was very excited about as I know she loves celebrations. I made it very special with photos of the pregnancy, gifts... she even cried. I was so happy to see that she liked it.\n\nWhen Father's Day arrived, I didn't receive anything. It wasn't the gift part, but I would've appreciated anything. Even a  letter. I have never been able to express my feelings towards celebrations in a very reactive way but I like them just as much as anyone else and I really looked forward to it. I tried to ignore it and not make a big deal out of it but I was hurt. My wife's family have always celebrated everything. So, I was surprised that she would forget about it.\n\nI eventually expressed my feelings to her. She apologized and said that she didn't think I cared about Father's day, but that she is sorry. I accepted her apologies and told her that I indeed liked Father's day too.\n\nNext year, I decided to prepare a weekend escape for us both on Mother's day. She once again loved it. But when Father's Day came around, to my surprise, she didn't even wish me a happy Father's day. I once again felt forgotten but couldn't bring myself to bring it to her attention as there is something about repeatedly asking my wife to do something for me on Father's day that rubs me the wrong way. I wish I didn't care about it but I do.\n\nI ignored it until I got over it and last year on Mother's day, I didn't do anything. My wife asked leading questions to see whether I prepared something but I had not.\n\nThe next few days, I got silent treatment for the first time since we got married. Barely a word out of her. I kept trying to talk to her and eventually, she broke down in tears and told me that she couldn't believe I would forget such an important day for her.\n\nMy intention wasn't to hurt her but I knew that I wouldn't be able to keep up with this one-sided dynamic. So, I thought that if only one of us was to enjoy something we both equally love, we should move on from it as I wouldn't want it to become something of resentment. We made peace and moved past it.\n\nFor the first few days of march, she has been making subtle snarky comments about Mother's day \"to make sure I don't forget again\". At first, I ignored them but she kept going. I ended up telling her that I only missed one celebration while she forgot 1 of my birthdays and every Father's day and I never tried to make her feel awful for it.\n\nAn argument happened, it escalated and even though we are okay now, it has become a sensitive topic.\n\nAITA for not giving anything to my wife on Mother's day?", "created_utc": 1678057772, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jh1ks/aita_for_not_giving_anything_to_my_wife_on/", "score": 409, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife is horrible. Father\u2019s Day is just as important as Mother\u2019s Day and she doesn\u2019t deserve to get celebrated and not reciprocate the effort. \n\nI have a similar dynamic - I get stuff for my partner for Father\u2019s Day because I like to celebrate it with our 2 kids. He doesn\u2019t get me much for Mother\u2019s Day because he\u2019s absolutely rubbish at gifts and just naturally isn\u2019t very good at arranging things.But I appreciate that he really does try.

She repeatedly failed to celebrate or recognize Father\u2019s Day. And also apparently at least one birthday.   She hinted in advance last year about what your plans were, to remind you to make sure you do something.  She\u2019s passive aggressively giving you grief in advance of this Mother\u2019s Day?!?

On the year that you got her nothing did she get you anything? Make it clear that the standard will be set by her from now on. She should not expect anything if she doesn't put any effort into you", "NTA\n\nShe is for ignoring Father's Day and your birthday.  It isn't  'forgetting'. It's deliberate.  \n\nYou need to bluntly tell her that you either celebrate both or neither.  Same goes for birthdays.  \n\nHonestly,  this shouldn't be thst difficult.", "NTA. But this year make sure you tell her exactly what you\u2019d like. Breakfast in bed? A day out alone with your daughter? Flowers? A bbq? Make it something significant so it hits home with her just how much you love it.", "ESH, on a technicality. \n\nCelebrations aren\u2019t tit for tat. I don\u2019t give my husband or my friends birthday presents because I want them to do the same for me. Otherwise, we might as well hand around the same $20 gift card. \n\nCelebrations are to celebrate and commemorate and enjoy the thing being celebrated. I hear it\u2019s really one sided and that sucks. I hear that you brought it up and weren\u2019t listened to and that is A Problem. You are absolutely correct that you deserve to be celebrated and honored and pampered too. \n\n1. Plan a reasonable Mother\u2019s Day celebration. Your kid is 4, ask them what they want to do for their Mom and support it. 100% their plan. 72 cupcakes and a handmade card with too much glitter? Perfect.\n\n2. At some point in time that isn\u2019t in the middle of another discussion or crisis, ask your wife what needs to happen to make sure she can celebrate Father\u2019s Day with you this year. You\u2019re hurt and just telling her you were hurt didn\u2019t fix it. So what gives? She loves you, she likes celebrating, does she need ideas? Does she need to put planning time on her calendar? What\u2019s the hang up here? You\u2019re smart people who love each other and can talk about feelings, you can fix this. What are her thoughts on how to get from where you are (spite ignoring Mother\u2019s Day while she tries to drop hints, and then seriously ignoring Father\u2019s Day while you are sad and hurt) to where you\u2019d both like to be?(Presumably some level of celebration of both days!)\n\n3. Plan your own celebration. My husband knocks the romantic stuff out of the park. But my birthday is in a weird time of year and while it doesn\u2019t get forgotten, I\u2019d like 50% more flair for it. So I do it myself. Last year I took the day off work and went to a spa day. I\u2019ve put together a wish list of a fancy meal and dinner guests. \nDo I want him to magically know the extra oomfph beyond a nice card and a nice dinner? Yes. Is that reasonable? No. So I make my own. It\u2019s not as much fun as being gifted the experience, but it is way more fun than spending my birthday sad and annoyed that I\u2019m not getting the extra sparkle I want. \n\nYou can do this. Happy Early Father\u2019s Day.", "Nta I tried doing Father\u2019s Day for my husband. He hates holidays of all sorts. But I tried. He doesn\u2019t do Mother\u2019s Day. It\u2019s disappointing to me because my kids are small and in my family the adults always did something to encourage us to make gifts for the mother/father (painted rocks, decorated toilet paper rolls were some of the gifts I remember giving and being very proud of, my dad even kept my painted rock on his office desk for the better part of 35 years) \n\nNext year for Mother\u2019s Day, help your kids make their mother something. That\u2019s all that\u2019s required. She\u2019s not your mother. And for Father\u2019s Day plan something for you and the family.

It sounds like you both need to work on communication. You don\u2019t tell her in a timely manner about your hurt feelings, and she\u2019s not understanding the problem. I highly doubt this is the only time you two have miscommunicated or had a lack of appropriate communication. This is building resentment instead of clearly setting up expectations from here on.", "Light YTA, you knew you were doing it to hurt her. Your feeling of only continuing something that you both enjoyed was not discussed between you two. So you knew it was gonna affect her. \n\nHurt people hurt people, I think that is what happened here.", "NTA. Your wife isn't your mother.", "NTA your wife suffers from Alzheimer or what?", "NTA. You\u2019re not her Father and she\u2019s not your Mother. You should focus on celebrating your father figures and mother figures that helped raise you.

She is definitely TA though for not even attempting to match your effort.", "You are not the assh*Le in this story at all", "ESH. Why are you being passive aggressive?

You were hurt so you because she forgot Father\u2019s Day. You decided to pay her back and hurt her. That\u2019s not productive. You talk about it.

It goes both ways", "Nta your wife is deeply selfish, I'm sorry", "NTA but to be honest, your friend's wife doesn't care. At all. He made his feelings clear more than once and she chose to forget it. Personally, I think they should let it go and stop celebrating them altogether. I have a bad feeling this Father's Day is going to have some malicious compliance to it.", "You are both the asshole. You've put in so much effort to remember mother's day each year and she's doesn't reciprocate. She's even forgotten your birthday. It seems though that she thinks you've forgotten rather than omitting celebrating mother's day intentionally. That though is an asshole move, you knew how it made you feel and yet you still didn't celebrate it anyway. \n\nOn your side though, I get why you did it. She's allegedly apologised for forgetting the year before, but still forgot this year! It seems like you need to sit and have a chat apologising that you felt like you had to deliberately hold off on celebrating mother's day but it was just because you were so hurt because she had forgotten father's day again even after apologising. You could give her a compromise. A cool idea would be buying two mothers and fathers day cards every year, and on each of them having \"parents day\" and both of you work together to celebrate each other simultaneously.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAlthough you should have brought it up the second time she \u201cforgot\u201d as well, you had already expressed to her the first time it happened that it hurts you she didn\u2019t get you something for Father\u2019s Day when you\u2019ve been doing it for her. \n\nInteresting how she\u2019s so excited for Mother\u2019s Day, asking questions, anticipating it\u2014but she can\u2019t seem to understand you might feel the same way about Father\u2019s Day.\n\nShe forgot every single time, then had to audacity to give you the silent treatment and toss a fit when you didn\u2019t do it once.\n\nEdit: clarity", "I'll admit, I'm not used to celebrations occuring on mothers / fathers day, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with starting to! It's not only fair that the both of you get to celebrate your work as parents thus far, but if it's something you value and appreciate, then its even more important for your significant other to respect that! I'm sorry this has happened not only once but twice. \n\nInitially, I would call your choice of ignoring mothers day as childish. However, you did take the first step and communicated your wish to celebrate fathers day. Since she forgot twice, it seems only fair that you decided to stop the celebration altogether. NTA.", "NTA I\u2019m confused about how she could possibly argue the fact that she has repeatedly ignored your desire to celebrate Father\u2019s Day. She should have apologized especially since she knows what it feels like now. I do feel like you should have said something the second time she forgot and maybe gave her the heads up that one sided celebrations are making you feel unloved. Communication when we feel vulnerable is really hard. From now on any time she brings up Mother\u2019s Day you should bring up Father\u2019s Day and gush about how excited you are to see what she\u2019s planning.", "ESH-she should have remembered. Takes 5 seconds to make a reminder on your phone. \n\nYou should have talked to her. She maybe hurtfully forgetful but you\u2019re purposely hurtful.

A month or so later, when it was Father\u2019s Day, 2022, did she do anything to celebrate you?  If she did, then you & your daughter should do something to celebrate Mother\u2019s Day this year.

You were hurt. You communicated the hurt. She still didn\u2019t follow through. This may have been a bit of a petty way to respond, but I understand where you\u2019re coming from.

You\u2019re just as much of a parent as she is.", "YTA. Tit for tat is a stupid game for the aspiring passive-aggressive, which is a silly thing to aim your aspirations at.\n\nI'd recommend the occasional mention leading up to Father's Day that you'd like it observed.", "NTA\n\nIt seems like she thinks she's the only one who should be remembered. I'm sure you've discussed why it's okay for her to ignore you, but she can't take being ignored herself. She needs to realize that everyone enjoys acknowledgment and a little celebration.\n\nGive her a really nice card and some flowers for Mother's Day. Help your daughter make a card for her. You'll see whether she's learned anything when Father's Day rolls around. If she ignores it again, it's time to discuss her thoughtlessness and lack of appreciation. Let her know that she can't expect to be celebrated if she doesn't celebrate others.", "NTA I never expected anything from my husband on Mother's Day because I wasn't his mother. And my husband felt the same way about Father's Day. When are children were young he used to make a big breakfast or plan a family cook out and help the children make a card and I did the same. As the children got older they helped plan and prepare the \"surprise\" meal.\n\nIt sounds like you and your wife need to talk about it and get on the same page about your expectations.", "ESH - her for obvious reasons, but you for not opening your mouth and taking to get about your feelings. I get it, you shouldn't have to ask your wife to acknowledge you on behalf of your very young child on Father's day. But that's clearly the world you live in. Either be an adult and talk to your wife and resolve this one and for all, or be prepared for this to be the reason your daughter has two Christmases and continues to not acknowledge you on Father's Day.", "Wife sounds a bit selfish tbh.

A card, a little gift, a delicious dinner...it's not difficult for her to do something nice for you. Your wife has been unkind and thoughtless to never celebrate you, but expect you to celebrate her.\n\nHas she explained why? Does she think because she's the one who carried the child and gave birth, that only she is deserving of recognition? Not so. I got my husband a Father's Day gift when I was still pregnant with our child. Why? Because he was so supportive during my pregnancy and was so thrilled to be a dad. And he has since been a wonderful father. \n\nYou have every right to be upset. Tell her that either you all celebrate both observances, or you celebrate neither. She doesn't get to be honored and then treat you like you're not important.", "So, both of you aren\u2019t acting well.\n\nWas she an asshole for not doing anything for Father\u2019s Day?

Your wife is kind of showing how selfish and lazy she is. You told her how upset you were with her, about her not doing anything for you for Father's day and she still did nothing since. She seriously can't expect you to go all out and do nothing in return. It took the pair of you to create the baby, not just her.", "NTA, In first place, she forgot your birthday but makes a drama when you don't make a celebration for her? Saying \"Happy fathers day\" doesn't take even one minute", "ESH \n\nYour wife is bad for not not bothering to do anything for you on Father\u2019s Day while still expecting you to plan a fairly extravagant day for her on Mother\u2019s Day.  She suck\u2019s doubly for not doing anything after you told her that you would like something. \n\nYou need to learn to express your feelings better.  You should have told her how you felt right away the first time she overlooked Father\u2019s Day but instead you waited.  I also think you probably were not direct enough about it when you eventually told her.  I think you needed to say something like, \u201cI was very hurt and disappointed when you didn\u2019t do anything for me on Father\u2019s Day.  I felt unappreciated as a husband and father, especially since I put a lot of thought and effort into making Mother\u2019s Day special for you.\u201d  Also there would be nothing wrong with gently reminding her that Father\u2019s  Day was coming up a couple weeks in advance. \n\nInstead it feels like you tested her to see if she would do anything the next time. Then instead of making it much more clear how it made you feel, you kept your feelings a secret for months.  It seems you did all of this so you could take revenge the following Mother\u2019s Day.  This might have given you some momentary satisfaction but it\u2019s not a great way to manage conflict in a marriage, especially if you want to stay married.", "ESH because you should have said something instead of just allowing it to fester", "ESH why not have an adult conversation with her about why you didn't do anything for mother's day after it happened? That way she knew and you guys could decide if you wanted to keep celebrating those days or not. That way you could express how she hurt you.

May I ask what is her reasoning as to why she keeps ignoring you on Father\u2019s Day/your birthday? \n\nBecause honestly it just comes across as that she thinks you are less important in your daughters life than she is so why bother celebrating.

Her expectation that you should do celebrations for her without reciprocation comes off as selfish.", "NTA\n\nShe's your wife, not your mother. When your child is old enough, your child can choose to make or get something for each of you on your parent-days. But whatever. Gifts should flow down anyway. I expect nothing from my children, but schools tend to do contrived and unoriginal crafts for the kids to gift parents regardless. \n\nI haven't given my husband a Fathers Day gift as he's not my dad, and I wouldn't want anything from him on Mothers Day either. That's weird and I think it's weird that couples do that. It's not Spouses' Day.\n\nMaybe a mention of \"thanks for being my babies' father\" but why do there always have to be consumer products involved/money spent to show appreciation?

Her expectations are off base.", "YTA I\u2019ll explain\u2026\u2026. If she is busy preoccupied with her kid, your kid, if she does most of the mental work for your family, Father\u2019s Day may well be at the back of her mind. It has nothing to do with you personally. \n\nI have an amazing dad, I forgot his birthday the day of. My kids winded up with the stomach flu on his birthday and it COMPLETELY SLIPPED MY MIND. I did remember the day before his bday. Forgot day of. Such is life. But you know about Mother\u2019s Day. There\u2019s no way to \u201crevenge\u201d things in a marriage. At that point YTA.", "NTA. I am curious though. Did she do anything for Father\u2019s Day after your talk last year or did she still ignore it?", "NTA\nThis year give your wife a card and call it a day !! There , you remembered her, and on Father\u2019s Day take your daughter and have your own celebration!!", "ESH. You could have communicated better about it instead of handling it the way you did.

Since she apologized, and said she understood how you felt, it is fair to assume she would respond according to your wishes... if not, she is being willfully offensive.

But this is absolutely something that needs addressed. She wants you to celebrate her as a mother, but refuses to celebrate you as a father.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nA friend posted about this and asked me to repost it myself if I wanted answers.\n\nI've been married for 5 years. My wife is 29. I am 31. We have a beautiful 4-year-old girl and have handled parenthood greatly by being supportive of each other. I work from home. So, it made things easier for both. We really love each other.\n\nThe issue started when the first Mother's Day came around, it was something I was very excited about as I know she loves celebrations. I made it very special with photos of the pregnancy, gifts... she even cried. I was so happy to see that she liked it.\n\nWhen Father's Day arrived, I didn't receive anything. It wasn't the gift part, but I would've appreciated anything. Even a  letter. I have never been able to express my feelings towards celebrations in a very reactive way but I like them just as much as anyone else and I really looked forward to it. I tried to ignore it and not make a big deal out of it but I was hurt. My wife's family have always celebrated everything. So, I was surprised that she would forget about it.\n\nI eventually expressed my feelings to her. She apologized and said that she didn't think I cared about Father's day, but that she is sorry. I accepted her apologies and told her that I indeed liked Father's day too.\n\nNext year, I decided to prepare a weekend escape for us both on Mother's day. She once again loved it. But when Father's Day came around, to my surprise, she didn't even wish me a happy Father's day. I once again felt forgotten but couldn't bring myself to bring it to her attention as there is something about repeatedly asking my wife to do something for me on Father's day that rubs me the wrong way. I wish I didn't care about it but I do.\n\nI ignored it until I got over it and last year on Mother's day, I didn't do anything. My wife asked leading questions to see whether I prepared something but I had not. \n\nThe next few days, I got silent treatment for the first time since we got married. Barely a word out of her. I kept trying to talk to her and eventually, she broke down in tears and told me that she couldn't believe I would forget such an important day for her.\n\nMy intention wasn't to hurt her but I knew that I wouldn't be able to keep up with this one-sided dynamic. So, I thought that if only one of us was to enjoy something we both equally love, we should move on from it as I wouldn't want it to become something of resentment. We made peace and moved past it.\n\nFor the first few days of march, she has been making subtle snarky comments about Mother's day \"to make sure I don't forget again\". At first, I ignored them but she kept going. I ended up telling her that I only missed one celebration while she forgot 1 of my birthdays and every Father's day and I never tried to make her feel awful for it. \n\nAn argument happened, it escalated and even though we are okay now, it has become a sensitive topic.\n\nAITA for not giving anything to my wife on Mother's day?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA - you deserve to be celebrated as much as she does", "NTA.

Her more so than you but nonetheless I implore you to go to couples counseling. You expressed how it made you feel and she continues to disregard you and then make herself out to be the ultimate victim when you don\u2019t celebrate her. In reality she is a hypocrite that believes her feelings are more valid than yours. Although you communicated to her your feelings the first time, you should have continued to talk about it because it does bother you, and that drove you to eventually decide to not celebrate the next Mother\u2019s Day. Even if you said it\u2019s not out of spite, you had to have realized that she would feel negative about that day not being acknowledged so instead of heading that off by have a conversation about it, she ends up feeling blindsided. It does not sound like at this point that any amount of discussion will make a difference so therapy together is a must - hopefully in that environment you can both sort out the situation.", "ESH, you two really need to work on communication.

But instead of just doing nothing for her the following Mother's Day, you should have explained that her ignoring Father's Day while you make sure to celebrate Mother's Day was causing a lot of resentment so you were no longer going to celebrate Mother's Day.

So, it sucks. We love each other deeply and I wish it didn't bother me, but it did. I told her and nothing changed.

Communicating to talk about how you feel and see how it can be resolved.", "Got it. I'll reserve judgment given I missed that!", "That\u2019s not just an American thing", "Thanks.", "Ah, thanks!", "NTA. Your wife is coming across as rules for thee but not for me, and it\u2019s not a good look. You are just as much a parent as she is, so her argument that you wouldn\u2019t care about Father\u2019s Day is weak.   \n\n\nYou were an adult and used your words  and *did* mention it to her and she\u2019s still managing to forget to celebrate you or even wish you a happy Father\u2019s Day?

Last year when you did nothing, what did she do for Father\u2019s Day after?", "I hear you, and I also understand the hurt and frustration you must have felt to get to such a point.\n\nMy point is just that this goes deeper than mothers day. You communicated something that hurt you, and she didn't pay attention to your feelings or took steps not to hurt you in the future. Then, you made the decision that you knew was going to hurt her (rational or justified as it was). That warrants some honest, straightforward conversations in a marriage, as well as possible therapy, IMHO.\n\nI can actually completely relate, once my husband forgot mother's day, and I was hurt. I communicated it on the day (most definitely not in the best, unemotional way possible), he understood that his actions hurt me, drove off and searched for an open store to purchase flowers and chocolates and apologise profusely.", "I would do something for myself on Father\u2019s Day, I would throw myself a party, maybe with other family members or friends buy myself gifts but your day shouldn\u2019t be ignored, could your wife see a therapist or something? NTA.", "Despite all the ESH and YTA, you're not an asshole. She is  constantly ignoring your feelings about it despite you bringing it up to her twice. It's quite selfish and entitled to expect it but not return it.

At the time, I thought it was the best thing to do.", "What about her forgetting his birthday and father day? Is that not a \u201cunilateral decision on things that impact two people\u201d?", "I don\u2019t think he made the decision.\n\nShe made it clear how unimportant the day was for her, when she did nothing 2 years in a row for Father\u2019s Day, even after he mentioned that he would like for something to be done.", "Sorry, but watching my dad slowly deteriorate and forget us isn't funny to me right now.", "There is such a thing as a joke in bad taste.", "Yikes.", "That\u2019s exactly what he said in the story and the comment that replied to you are you ok?? lol", "I am actually fine with uncomfortable conversations just not about receiving gifts or a present per se. It defies the entire concept in my opinion. \n\nWe have had several uncomfortable conversations and some arguments like every married couple in a very healthy way but as I said, I am not used to having to ask for a gift, I don't think anyone is. Asking once was already something. Hence why I chose not to ask twice.", "so that makes him the AH? idgi \n\nshe\u2019s the one acting like an ass and going so far as to make snarky remarks about the situation", "I quote\n\n\"I eventually expressed my feelings to her. She apologized and said that she didn't think I cared about Father's day, but that she is sorry. I accepted her apologies and told her that I indeed liked Father's day too.\"\n\n\"Next year, I decided to prepare a weekend escape for us both on Mother's day. She once again loved it. But when Father's Day came around, to my surprise, she didn't even wish me a happy Father's day. I once again felt forgotten but couldn't bring myself to bring it to her attention as there is something about repeatedly asking my wife to do something for me on Father's day that rubs me the wrong way. I wish I didn't care about it but I do.\"\n\nOp clearly communicated his feelings, then after being hurt still did something special for her for mother's day, and then she blatantly ignored fathers day once again and he decided not to bring something up that she obviously didn't care about and blatantly ignored.\n\nEdit; so he's more to blame for communication even though she ignored the communication outside of saying sorry. Are you telling me she didn't tell her dad happy fathers day? Or see anything about fathers day? She made a CHOICE not to say anything to him and to IGNORE his COMMUNICATION", "What about the next time? And the next one? Is there a specific number? With that logic, it would be a never-ending cycle.", "It happened to one of my birthdays two years prior to her first mother's day and then two father's day straight.\n\nShe is not forgetful. Hence why it really hurt me. She is a great wife, make no mistakes, but this topic did hurt as she does not forget her friends' birthdays and even organises them. Same for family members. That is why the pain really stung.\n\nI am the forgetful one out of the two. For that reason, I've got all important dates on my calendar on repeat.", "All I have to go off of is what happens in America LOL.", "You need to put spaces between the letters of ESH and YTA or your negative votes will be counted.", "You set a standard and then took it away cause she didn\u2019t do it for you, it was payback.  You need to own your actions and stop trying to make excuses.", "Yes that is indeed very sad, but they did not mean malice towards you with that joke, not every joke will land with everyone. I'll be praying for your Dad tonight tho, I lost my grandmother to it so I understand how it feels, stay strong <3", "I think, joke or no joke, we can all agree that mental disorders just fucking hurt.", "Thats fair.

I don't have high hopes on your wife but maybe she'll surprise us", "ESH.  I don\u2019t know why couples test each other this way.  I don\u2019t let my husband forget Mother\u2019s Day, our anniversary or my birthday.  I don\u2019t forget his special days either.  Well in advance I bring it up, and suggest what I\u2019d like to do, or if \u201csomeone\u201dwanted to get me a thoughtful gift, I would appreciate X, y or z.  I\u2019m not big into gifts at this stage of my life, so flowers are great too, or a nice lunch.  But I don\u2019t wait for my husband to forget.  So much wasted energy, and unnecessarily hurt feelings. \u201cIf they really loved me, they\u2019d remember.\u201d Well, don\u2019t let that happen.  There\u2019s so many difficult issues that come into everyone\u2019s lives, loss, pain, illness - don\u2019t miss an opportunity to celebrate, even if you have to plan your own birthday party.  And do it with a joyful heart, that you have a family to celebrate with you. Make it a family rule:  Of course you will celebrate Mother\u2019s Day, of course you\u2019ll celebrate Father\u2019s Day, and birthdays,  because that\u2019s what your family does, and it\u2019s not optional.", "u/Due_Relationship_761 - I\u2019m totally on board with you here.

He's communicating what makes him feel appreciated just the same way it makes her feel appreciated. He did it verbally twice and was ignored. That's not payback.", "Why would I say I suck with the ESH verdict if I was the wife?", "He isn\u2019t communicating anymore.  He just stopped doing what he had been doing because she didn\u2019t change after the first no Father\u2019s Day and did the same on the second.  He stopped talking to her and just ignored her comments. It\u2019s simple payback. They really need to sit down and hash it out."]}
