It's something the kids are saying. It's also not something that is personal to Alex.", "NTA- this is a BIG rumor, especially in a school. This is something they would have to spend time investigating and take very seriously. Liz should know this, as her job would be in jeopardy if it gets higher up. \n\nThis needed to be handled IMMEDIATELY and I applaud you for doing the right thing so Liz could handle this how she wanted to.", "NTA that type of rumour will spread like wildfire with school kids, and then the parents. It needs to be stopped as soon as possible", "NTA. You did the right thing. This could get her in huge trouble and I really hope it's not true. Alex just telling others and laughing about it is a really bad look. I mean imagine if that's actually true, the kids tell a teacher they trust, and she responds like that. Very weird. I really hope it's just kids being kids, and if Alex believes it's not actually true either, surely she'd still let Liz know that the kids are saying that? Weird behavior all around.", "NTA. If Alex I\u2019d telling students about their personal life and also bullying another teacher, they seem to be the issue here - not you or Liz.", "NTA. You did the right thing by telling Liz. And you\u2019re right that it is the sort of thing that could adversely affect her career so she deserves to know about it. Alex sounds like a pot-stirrer. She has no right to be mad when she was spreading gross rumors about the new teacher.", "NTA\n\nAlex Is a big AH.\n\nIf the rumor is false, Liz can get out in front of it. If it's true, she at least is aware of the shit storm headed her way. \n\nYou dis the right thing.", "NTA. I think you did the right thing.", "nta. kids are nasty with no idea how it affects people in the real world. the very least we can do as adults in a school setting is be informed.", "NTA. Sounds like Alex doesn't have the maturity to be working with children, and Liz definitely deserved to know what was being said about her. Shame on Alex for encouraging gossip like some kind of school-aged girl instead of nipping it in the bud like an adult.", "NTA it sounds like Alex is intentionally fanning the flames and is only mad cuz the rumors can be traced back to her", "NTA. Alex didn't tell you some personal secret. She was spreading a malicious and potentially damaging rumor about someone else via gossip. Alex can kick rocks.", "NTA Alex needs to brush up on the definition of trust. And I actually think that Alex\u2019s freedom to get of sharing everything with students is potentially inappropriate and problematic. You absolutely did the right thing by informing Liz, but I also think you need to go talk to administration ASAP.", "NTA. You were 100% right to tell her!", "Nta!! If anything i would report Alex with the higher ups and parents bc she\nDoesn\u2019t have boundaries with the kids.. also Alex is that type of friend who would gladly see you fall down for pleasure so be careful of what you say and do with her.. \n\nYou did good on telling Liz so she can confront everyone about the rumor and put a stop", "NTA - you did the exact right thing.
