But my concern now is that the kids stated this happened a year ago, and I mean... If this happened a year ago, why bring it up now? Why wait all this time?", "My concern was why did Alex not defend Liz or even stop the kids and go on and tell another person about this. That wasn't fair towards Liz", "That is odd. What grade are these kids in? It sounds like they may not know the repercussions this rumor could cause for Liz.", "My mom has been in a school for most of my life.

If this was true and happened a year ago, Alex would be p*ssed you said anything cos it will get out that she did nothing. Assuming it\u2019s entirely made up and nothing more than malicious gossip (the likely scenario), Alex is p*ssed that her gossiping and inappropriate boundaries with students are about to be exposed. Either way, she\u2019s worried she is going to face repercussions. Good on you for telling Liz. Assuming she indeed hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, highly suggest she calls their bluff and takes it to school authorities herself and turns the tables on them.

NTA but don't worry, she is a woman, she will be fine.\n\n\nI don't know why i got downvoted, that's reality. Things like this are not taken seriously when done by women.

Liz has the right to know if shit is being spread about her - this could have serious implications for her career.

But is there a possible diplomatic way to verify this story? Are the kids really said that and are they are the source of such rumor? Or is it possible Alex made it up?", "Nta.

I teach and yeah, if it had happened last year all of those kids would have been talking and laughing about it last year. It would have come out. Children do not sit on salacious gossip for a full year, especially about sex-stuff. Alex is the one who dropped the ball here, she should have brought it to someone higher up the food chain the first moment she heard this, and that\u2019s why she\u2019s all \u201cyou broke my trust\u201d because it makes her look bad, too. Hopefully it\u2019s all a lie and Liz is not looking at sex-toys on her school computer because\u2026.yeah. Anyway, tell Liz but also tell someone in charge and let them know that Alex has supposedly been sitting on this info cuz that\u2019s sus", "Yea, that can be debatable.\n\nIn this case the kids told Alex, the appropriate action would\u2019ve been for her to inform admin. and let them figure out what happened. Then inform the kids and parents that either the kids need some attention and guidance on what they\u2019re exposed to and discussing. Or the teacher is at fault and the kids need to be supported making sense of what they saw - and teacher disciplined. \n\nIf it was accidental, that\u2019s explainable. She doesn\u2019t need your heads up and actually makes it look worse/harder to be sure of Liz\u2019s account of events.\n\nThere is no trust with Alex.

There\u2019s a boundary to what you report and don\u2019t, or at least guide the kids to do so via you or a teacher they feel comfortable going to.\n\nWould you be TA telling the colleague, technically yes because the admin should talk to her and confirm fairly. Not you or Alex. This shouldn\u2019t be discussed you are right about, by anyone outside admin and employee at first. The kids should also not be affected and having the teacher handle it is obscure imho.", "And you my dear OP are why I think your a kind soul you stop rumors and try to help your coworkers", "My dad was a teacher for 30 years. He had to retire early due to a rumor like this even even after fighting it with his union rep and a lawyer. Thank you for letting her know and giving her the chance to get ahead of this.
