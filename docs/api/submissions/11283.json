{"id": 11283, "submission_id": "11g1t63", "title": "AITA for choosing my senior cat over my sister and potentialy allowing her to become homeless", "selftext": "I will preface this by saying that my mother treated my sister and I differently; I was always less than, while she could do no wrong. She'd always buy my sister everything she wanted, while I wore her hand-me-downs. I moved out at 18, worked through college, went NC with mom and LC with sister and our paths diverged greatly from there. I now work in a field that pays well, while she is a sahm. I guess I never quite got over this, and while I know the main AH is my mother and my sister didn't really know any better, I still fester negative feelings towards both of them.\n\nI found Tom in a bag as a newborn kitten, he was the only one still alive and I raised him over summer break when I was 13. Then, when school started, my mother got rid of him and I had to go through great and extreme lengths to find out where she dumped him. Took me a week to find him and we've been together ever since.\n\nFor a few months Tom hasn't really been okay and has been slowly declining. The vet, however, based on the recent blood panel we did, was confident that he still has some life left to live and said that he's by far the healthiest geriatric cat she's seen in a while. Thus, we decided to try out surgery to improve his quality of life, even though he's 21. This surgery comes with a price tag, i'm not in the US, but it's around 3 months' worth of minimum wage in my country. It won't set us back much, hardly an inconvenience, but we'll be frugal just in case complications happen. He's scheduled for Monday, fingers crossed!\n\nAnyway, my sister dropped by on Sunday, which was strange, we haven't spoken since she mass'ed me a merry christmas gif on fb. Looks like her husband jumped onto the NFT bandwagon and they're kind of broke and a few months behind on mortgage and asked if I could help her out with the payments, since they're at risk of becoming homeless. I said I'm sorry she's going through this, but this is not a good time for me either, and listed the reasons above; I do not want to ever be in a situation where my cat's life depends on $100 that I cannot afford to pay. I suggested she got a job and maybe downsize/move in with mother while they get back up on their feet. She did not take this well, called me a c\\*nt and a crazy cat lady that's going to end up alone plus some other nice words. I kicked her out.\n\nMy mother and other relatives have been spamming me through the week for being heartless and caring more about an animal than my own flesh and blood. My husband says I could've just given her some cash to avoid the drama and he's right. I could've. This is why I feel like I might be the AH, in the end, the main reason I chose not to help is due to my childhood baggage.

She'd always buy my sister everything she wanted, while I wore her hand-me-downs. I moved out at 18, worked through college, went NC with mom and LC with sister and our paths diverged greatly from there. I now work in a field that pays well, while she is a sahm. I guess I never quite got over this, and while I know the main AH is my mother and my sister didn't really know any better, I still fester negative feelings towards both of them.\n\nI found Tom in a bag as a newborn kitten, he was the only one still alive and I raised him over summer break when I was 13. Then, when school started, my mother got rid of him and I had to go through great and extreme lengths to find out where she dumped him. Took me a week to find him and we've been together ever since.\n\nFor a few months Tom hasn't really been okay and has been slowly declining. The vet, however, based on the recent blood panel we did, was confident that he still has some life left to live and said that he's by far the healthiest geriatric cat she's seen in a while. Thus, we decided to try out surgery to improve his quality of life, even though he's 21. This surgery comes with a price tag, i'm not in the US, but it's around 3 months' worth of minimum wage in my country. It won't set us back much, hardly an inconvenience, but we'll be frugal just in case complications happen. He's scheduled for Monday, fingers crossed!\n\nAnyway, my sister dropped by on Sunday, which was strange, we haven't spoken since she mass'ed me a merry christmas gif on fb. Looks like her husband jumped onto the NFT bandwagon and they're kind of broke and a few months behind on mortgage and asked if I could help her out with the payments, since they're at risk of becoming homeless. I said I'm sorry she's going through this, but this is not a good time for me either, and listed the reasons above; I do not want to ever be in a situation where my cat's life depends on $100 that I cannot afford to pay. I suggested she got a job and maybe downsize/move in with mother while they get back up on their feet. She did not take this well, called me a c\\*nt and a crazy cat lady that's going to end up alone plus some other nice words. I kicked her out.\n\nMy mother and other relatives have been spamming me through the week for being heartless and caring more about an animal than my own flesh and blood. My husband says I could've just given her some cash to avoid the drama and he's right. I could've.

Whatever relationship they might have had helping her sister in need seems like a noble thing to me, and denying her help because she is not sure she can save her cat that is already one foot in the grave is inconsiderate and blatantly selfish.", "I was about to make fun of this guy when I read your post. You\u2019re tripping balls. Of course if I had to chose between you and my cat you would be screwed. But if I had to chose between you and a cat, then naturally I would save the member of my species.\n\nStop watching avatar and them planet of the apes movies. Human Supremacy! :3", "It seems that OP can afford it, the vet is confident that Tom will survive it and it has a chance of good quality life afterwards. A lot depends on the surgery - I've done surgery on a 10 year old ferret (20 in cat terms) - the surgery was a fairly complicated dental. It seemed a waste to kill an otherwise healthy if elderly animal because she had a broken tooth that meant she wasn't eating when it was a fairly straightforward operation apart from for her age. She got another year, we got more time with a much loved pet. And if she had passed on table, well same outcome as PTS. Major surgery it would be hard to recover from wouldn't be in best interests of animal and I know elderly humans who have chosen palliatative care for similar reasons.", "You are not a nice person! I was so excited opening the link!\ud83d\ude11", "LOL you got me with that one.", "This is worse than being rick-rolled.   Damn you.", "Damn you!!!!!!   I was hoping for an adorable cat pic and you post that guy\ud83d\ude05", "LMAO", "Hahahaha", "No. \n\nNo no. Lol", "Engaging in the tomfoolery I see", "haha. that was a nice \"pause for laughter\" moment in my day. Thanks", "Just because you\u2019ve never had a negative experience doesn\u2019t mean bad vets don\u2019t exist. The point is we don\u2019t know if OP has a good or bad vet, and frankly OP may not fully know either. A second opinion is a good precaution."]}
