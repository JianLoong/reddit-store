{"id": 11283, "submission_id": "11g1t63", "title": "AITA for choosing my senior cat over my sister and potentialy allowing her to become homeless", "selftext": "I will preface this by saying that my mother treated my sister and I differently; I was always less than, while she could do no wrong. She'd always buy my sister everything she wanted, while I wore her hand-me-downs. I moved out at 18, worked through college, went NC with mom and LC with sister and our paths diverged greatly from there. I now work in a field that pays well, while she is a sahm. I guess I never quite got over this, and while I know the main AH is my mother and my sister didn't really know any better, I still fester negative feelings towards both of them.\n\nI found Tom in a bag as a newborn kitten, he was the only one still alive and I raised him over summer break when I was 13. Then, when school started, my mother got rid of him and I had to go through great and extreme lengths to find out where she dumped him. Took me a week to find him and we've been together ever since.\n\nFor a few months Tom hasn't really been okay and has been slowly declining. The vet, however, based on the recent blood panel we did, was confident that he still has some life left to live and said that he's by far the healthiest geriatric cat she's seen in a while. Thus, we decided to try out surgery to improve his quality of life, even though he's 21. This surgery comes with a price tag, i'm not in the US, but it's around 3 months' worth of minimum wage in my country. It won't set us back much, hardly an inconvenience, but we'll be frugal just in case complications happen. He's scheduled for Monday, fingers crossed!\n\nAnyway, my sister dropped by on Sunday, which was strange, we haven't spoken since she mass'ed me a merry christmas gif on fb. Looks like her husband jumped onto the NFT bandwagon and they're kind of broke and a few months behind on mortgage and asked if I could help her out with the payments, since they're at risk of becoming homeless. I said I'm sorry she's going through this, but this is not a good time for me either, and listed the reasons above; I do not want to ever be in a situation where my cat's life depends on $100 that I cannot afford to pay. I suggested she got a job and maybe downsize/move in with mother while they get back up on their feet. She did not take this well, called me a c\\*nt and a crazy cat lady that's going to end up alone plus some other nice words. I kicked her out.\n\nMy mother and other relatives have been spamming me through the week for being heartless and caring more about an animal than my own flesh and blood. My husband says I could've just given her some cash to avoid the drama and he's right. I could've. This is why I feel like I might be the AH, in the end, the main reason I chose not to help is due to my childhood baggage.

I moved out at 18, worked through college, went NC with mom and LC with sister and our paths diverged greatly from there. I now work in a field that pays well, while she is a sahm. I guess I never quite got over this, and while I know the main AH is my mother and my sister didn't really know any better, I still fester negative feelings towards both of them.\n\nI found Tom in a bag as a newborn kitten, he was the only one still alive and I raised him over summer break when I was 13. Then, when school started, my mother got rid of him and I had to go through great and extreme lengths to find out where she dumped him. Took me a week to find him and we've been together ever since.\n\nFor a few months Tom hasn't really been okay and has been slowly declining. The vet, however, based on the recent blood panel we did, was confident that he still has some life left to live and said that he's by far the healthiest geriatric cat she's seen in a while. Thus, we decided to try out surgery to improve his quality of life, even though he's 21. This surgery comes with a price tag, i'm not in the US, but it's around 3 months' worth of minimum wage in my country. It won't set us back much, hardly an inconvenience, but we'll be frugal just in case complications happen. He's scheduled for Monday, fingers crossed!\n\nAnyway, my sister dropped by on Sunday, which was strange, we haven't spoken since she mass'ed me a merry christmas gif on fb. Looks like her husband jumped onto the NFT bandwagon and they're kind of broke and a few months behind on mortgage and asked if I could help her out with the payments, since they're at risk of becoming homeless. I said I'm sorry she's going through this, but this is not a good time for me either, and listed the reasons above; I do not want to ever be in a situation where my cat's life depends on $100 that I cannot afford to pay. I suggested she got a job and maybe downsize/move in with mother while they get back up on their feet. She did not take this well, called me a c\\*nt and a crazy cat lady that's going to end up alone plus some other nice words. I kicked her out.\n\nMy mother and other relatives have been spamming me through the week for being heartless and caring more about an animal than my own flesh and blood.

Her comments are really out of line. She's trying to treat you like an ATM, especially since contact with her has been limited. She can live with the mother and the relatives can contribute as well. Are they not family as well? And once you open up that ATM, they'll be constantly hitting you up.", "ESH\n\nYou wouldn't have been an asshole if you hadn't told her, in extreme detail, about how much more important the cat is to her face. That's not nice for anyone to hear, there are kids involved, which makes that worse, and admit it: you enjoyed telling her that.\n\nI'd fully exonerate you if you'd stuck with a simple \"I'm sorry, but it's impossible\".

That being said, I think helping  out a family member when able is a very high priority for me personally. Her cursing at you is definitely deplorable and perhaps even hurt your feelings(I don't know), however if you just walk in her shoes for a bit: You are a failure in life who is about to lose everything and your situation is so bad that your best option is to ask for some money from your successful sister, who in turn decides that her cat(who unfortunately might die soon) has a higher priority than the person who she spent years growing up together. \n\nIf your sister keeps begging you for money again and again then you should definitely not help her. Not negotiable, and if that is the case then ignore what I say after.\n\nFrom my point of view her getting mad at you is completely understandable. Cursing at you is a low blow sure but I don't personally know your sister. Maybe that's how she acts when she gets really angry(that doesn't mean of course that she is allowed to do that).\n\nSo I will go with Yes you are indeed the asshole.", "YTA.

Looks like her husband jumped onto the NFT bandwagon and they're kind of broke and a few months behind on mortgage and asked if I could help her out with the payments, since they're at risk of becoming homeless. I said I'm sorry she's going through this, but this is not a good time for me either, and listed the reasons above; I do not want to ever be in a situation where my cat's life depends on $100 that I cannot afford to pay. I suggested she got a job and maybe downsize/move in with mother while they get bac\n\nAlso:  mother and other relatives could give her the money", "Absolutely right. And establishing that you'll give cash to avoid drama will just mean you end up paying out for more drama forever.\n\nNTA.", "Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. OP is definitely NTA. When it comes to money requests, \"I'm sorry, I'm really strapped now. Can't help.\" It's enough to show that you heard the request, and you can't help, it gives a little empathy and usually it gets them off your case.

Should she just put the cat to sleep because they have an issue that's currently making life a bit more difficult for them, but that's curable from surgery? \n\nIf you're just going to put an animal to sleep for no other reason than they are an older animal, I sure hope you don't have any pets. If the surgery was going to only cause harm to prolong the cats life, then maybe I would see your point, but that's not the case here and you really have no right to call someone selfish for doing what they can for their furry family member.", "I've discussed this aspect with the vet as I was also torn on the decision given his age, the options were keep him on his current meds, but that's what caused him to decline, operate him or put him to sleep.

Plenty of cats live \"past normal expectancy\" with a decent quality of life, and OP is consulting medical professionals throughout the process.", "That's an interesting way to pivot the situation. I was thinking that OP shouldn't have spent time explaining and defending the choice to spend her money and just said \"no, I can't.\" \nYour point is way more direct and makes me think my original verdict was hasty.", "Any animals life is worth exactly the same as a human life. We are all animals, just different species. She has something she needs that money for and  is under no obligation to help her sister out because her husband made some stupid decisions. She has very little to no relationship with her sister, and the fact that her sister reacted the way she did gives us an insight into why. All family means is that you share the same relatives.
