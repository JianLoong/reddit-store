She'd always buy my sister everything she wanted, while I wore her hand-me-downs. I moved out at 18, worked through college, went NC with mom and LC with sister and our paths diverged greatly from there. I now work in a field that pays well, while she is a sahm. I guess I never quite got over this, and while I know the main AH is my mother and my sister didn't really know any better, I still fester negative feelings towards both of them.\n\nI found Tom in a bag as a newborn kitten, he was the only one still alive and I raised him over summer break when I was 13. Then, when school started, my mother got rid of him and I had to go through great and extreme lengths to find out where she dumped him. Took me a week to find him and we've been together ever since.\n\nFor a few months Tom hasn't really been okay and has been slowly declining. The vet, however, based on the recent blood panel we did, was confident that he still has some life left to live and said that he's by far the healthiest geriatric cat she's seen in a while. Thus, we decided to try out surgery to improve his quality of life, even though he's 21. This surgery comes with a price tag, i'm not in the US, but it's around 3 months' worth of minimum wage in my country. It won't set us back much, hardly an inconvenience, but we'll be frugal just in case complications happen. He's scheduled for Monday, fingers crossed!\n\nAnyway, my sister dropped by on Sunday, which was strange, we haven't spoken since she mass'ed me a merry christmas gif on fb. Looks like her husband jumped onto the NFT bandwagon and they're kind of broke and a few months behind on mortgage and asked if I could help her out with the payments, since they're at risk of becoming homeless. I said I'm sorry she's going through this, but this is not a good time for me either, and listed the reasons above; I do not want to ever be in a situation where my cat's life depends on $100 that I cannot afford to pay. I suggested she got a job and maybe downsize/move in with mother while they get back up on their feet. She did not take this well, called me a c\\*nt and a crazy cat lady that's going to end up alone plus some other nice words. I kicked her out.\n\nMy mother and other relatives have been spamming me through the week for being heartless and caring more about an animal than my own flesh and blood. My husband says I could've just given her some cash to avoid the drama and he's right. I could've. This is why I feel like I might be the AH, in the end, the main reason I chose not to help is due to my childhood baggage.

My statement is was directed at those who seem to get massively butt-hurt about couples not wanting kids or who don't do it immediately after getting married.", "Yeah, I'll compare animal life to human life exactly as I wish. We're all living beings and just because some humans decided that humans are more valuable in life, doesn't mean I have to follow that same philosophy. That doesn't make me \"disrespectful\". \n\nYour mom was her own caregiver. She had the capability and mental capacity to decide what she wanted to do. A pet is taken care of by its owner, who is the person who will make the decision just as in human life when a substitute decision maker is needed. Again, relating to choice, children or those without the mental capacity to make choices have things chosen for them regarding their health as well, and that's no different to this situation, and again, does not make this person selfish.", "don't send this sister a thin dime", "I was gonna say this.

My 16-year-old, hyperthyroid-ic, cantankerous orange lady sends the most affectionate of hisses, yowls, and baps to Tom.\n\nETA.  NTA.  Fuck that choosing beggar.  Toxic people like that only see family being important when they need something from you.", "Your sister should have thought about that before she married a financially irresponsible idiot that gambled their money away on a KNOWN SCAM. \n\nIf your family are so concerned for her, I'm sure they'll be transferring her cash in a heartbeat!\n\nNTA, 1000 times over.

I just went through lots of vet visits and such with my geriatric kitty.  You aren't blood related to your cat, but he's still family and is going through some medical procedures.

Any money you give is only going to followed by requests for more money somewhere down the line.", "I find it too weirdly uncomfortable to give no excuses, even though I know that\u2019s dumb. My response to that is to be vague instead of specific with my reasons. \u201cWe can\u2019t help right now due to some unexpected expenses.\u201d It feels way less uncomfortable than saying \u201cNo\u201d but also doesn\u2019t give details for people to critique.", "I completely relate to that. My whole life I have felt like I have to make excuses. I learned that \"no\" is a complete sentence. It's hard but in the end rewarding. I practice \" I am sorry, that won't work for me\" \n\nBest wishes to you and your kitty.
