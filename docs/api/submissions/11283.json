{"id": 11283, "submission_id": "11g1t63", "title": "AITA for choosing my senior cat over my sister and potentialy allowing her to become homeless", "selftext": "I will preface this by saying that my mother treated my sister and I differently; I was always less than, while she could do no wrong. She'd always buy my sister everything she wanted, while I wore her hand-me-downs. I moved out at 18, worked through college, went NC with mom and LC with sister and our paths diverged greatly from there. I now work in a field that pays well, while she is a sahm. I guess I never quite got over this, and while I know the main AH is my mother and my sister didn't really know any better, I still fester negative feelings towards both of them.\n\nI found Tom in a bag as a newborn kitten, he was the only one still alive and I raised him over summer break when I was 13. Then, when school started, my mother got rid of him and I had to go through great and extreme lengths to find out where she dumped him. Took me a week to find him and we've been together ever since.\n\nFor a few months Tom hasn't really been okay and has been slowly declining. The vet, however, based on the recent blood panel we did, was confident that he still has some life left to live and said that he's by far the healthiest geriatric cat she's seen in a while. Thus, we decided to try out surgery to improve his quality of life, even though he's 21. This surgery comes with a price tag, i'm not in the US, but it's around 3 months' worth of minimum wage in my country. It won't set us back much, hardly an inconvenience, but we'll be frugal just in case complications happen. He's scheduled for Monday, fingers crossed!\n\nAnyway, my sister dropped by on Sunday, which was strange, we haven't spoken since she mass'ed me a merry christmas gif on fb. Looks like her husband jumped onto the NFT bandwagon and they're kind of broke and a few months behind on mortgage and asked if I could help her out with the payments, since they're at risk of becoming homeless. I said I'm sorry she's going through this, but this is not a good time for me either, and listed the reasons above; I do not want to ever be in a situation where my cat's life depends on $100 that I cannot afford to pay. I suggested she got a job and maybe downsize/move in with mother while they get back up on their feet. She did not take this well, called me a c\\*nt and a crazy cat lady that's going to end up alone plus some other nice words. I kicked her out.\n\nMy mother and other relatives have been spamming me through the week for being heartless and caring more about an animal than my own flesh and blood. My husband says I could've just given her some cash to avoid the drama and he's right. I could've. This is why I feel like I might be the AH, in the end, the main reason I chose not to help is due to my childhood baggage.

I moved out at 18, worked through college, went NC with mom and LC with sister and our paths diverged greatly from there. I now work in a field that pays well, while she is a sahm. I guess I never quite got over this, and while I know the main AH is my mother and my sister didn't really know any better, I still fester negative feelings towards both of them.\n\nI found Tom in a bag as a newborn kitten, he was the only one still alive and I raised him over summer break when I was 13. Then, when school started, my mother got rid of him and I had to go through great and extreme lengths to find out where she dumped him. Took me a week to find him and we've been together ever since.\n\nFor a few months Tom hasn't really been okay and has been slowly declining. The vet, however, based on the recent blood panel we did, was confident that he still has some life left to live and said that he's by far the healthiest geriatric cat she's seen in a while. Thus, we decided to try out surgery to improve his quality of life, even though he's 21. This surgery comes with a price tag, i'm not in the US, but it's around 3 months' worth of minimum wage in my country. It won't set us back much, hardly an inconvenience, but we'll be frugal just in case complications happen. He's scheduled for Monday, fingers crossed!\n\nAnyway, my sister dropped by on Sunday, which was strange, we haven't spoken since she mass'ed me a merry christmas gif on fb. Looks like her husband jumped onto the NFT bandwagon and they're kind of broke and a few months behind on mortgage and asked if I could help her out with the payments, since they're at risk of becoming homeless. I said I'm sorry she's going through this, but this is not a good time for me either, and listed the reasons above; I do not want to ever be in a situation where my cat's life depends on $100 that I cannot afford to pay. I suggested she got a job and maybe downsize/move in with mother while they get back up on their feet. She did not take this well, called me a c\\*nt and a crazy cat lady that's going to end up alone plus some other nice words. I kicked her out.\n\nMy mother and other relatives have been spamming me through the week for being heartless and caring more about an animal than my own flesh and blood. My husband says I could've just given her some cash to avoid the drama and he's right. I could've.
