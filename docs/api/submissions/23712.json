My brother had a medical history and we think it\u2019s because of how they might have to fund us during an emergency, they eventually stopped calling us. \n\nFew incidents that stood out from the past:\n\n- Few years ago, my brother\u2019s kidneys started to fail. He\u2019s been on dialysis and multiple times in ICU. My mom informed them but no one came down to visit us. Ever. So we stopped sharing. I think this hurt the most. Mind you, they\u2019d put up stories of all their travels, but somehow didn\u2019t have the time for this. \n\n- One of my cousins had a grand engagement party and we came to know about it via Instagram. They informed us later and justified\u2014 \u201cWe only invited first blood.\u201d That family doesn\u2019t speak to us anymore. \n\n- In 20 years and they\u2019ve probably visited us twice.

My mom\u2019s justification was\u2014 I\u2019m the last and youngest in the family, and it was our first big event as a family. We should\u2019ve atleast extended an invitation. \n\n- When one of my doctor cousin\u2019s tried to molest me, and my mom informed the family, they still invited him to all the big events, kept in touch and said they can\u2019t just cut off relations like that. \n\nAn invited family member recently informed them. They confronted my mom, almost shit talked to her and stopped talking. \n\nI don\u2019t feel they took any responsibility, no one held themselves accountable for their poor behaviour and they left us to fend for ourselves. Except for a text on Birthdays, I never got a basic how are you or career guidance? I\u2019m proud to call myself a self made independent woman, but as elders of my family, i feel they didn\u2019t do their part.\n\nAfter this, I\u2019m coming across as a bitch and a mannerless woman and my mom while she accepts my reasons, thinks it\u2019s my fault.\n\nAITA for not extending an invitation?

It sounds like these people have already decided that because your father is gone, the rest of his family went with him. It's sad, but it happens.\n\nThey've done nothing to deserve an invitation to ykur special day. Don't feel guilty, at all. Enjoy the new life you're building for yourself.

They may be biologically related, but these people aren't really \"family\", you know? They sound like basically strangers at this point. If they make zero effort to have a relationship with you, why on earth would you invite them to your wedding? Makes no sense to me, and despite how they clearly feel, they are not entitled to be included at your wedding. And *of course* they are going to start drama about it- because now they can blame *you* for the lack of relationship moving forward. Honestly though, let them. Just be done with them, they have proven that they aren't worthy of being part of your life and you don't need their negative, dramatic BS. Enjoy your special day without all that mess.", "NTA.\n\nConsider this a blessing  in disguide. This might actually be an impetus to permanently cut them off from your life.

You\u2019re clearly ignoring their history of not inviting us. I simply followed their lead.
