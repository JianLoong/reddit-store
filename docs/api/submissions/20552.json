YTA, but I left my comment below in case something changes or just helps in general. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI believe that it is totally fine to split 50/50 or proportional.\n\nIf you split proportional, you just have to be clear for what bills this applies, the percentage, and what happens if the income levels change (aka if the lower earner makes more in the future, you will change the bill split for that change).\n\nFor 50/50, also totally fine, but it has to be based on the LOWER earner. So if you (the lower earner) can afford $1,000 in rent, and him (higher earner) can afford $5,000 in rent, you pick a place that is in YOUR budget, not his. Same with the cable/internet package you pick, same with shared groceries, etc. The budget has to be based on what the lower earner can afford, and certainly shouldn't have you dipping in to your savings.\n\nSo just tell him, if he wants to do 50/50, that's fine,  you will have to find a new apartment together with the rent being X.\n\nAlso, reconsider moving in with someone who calls you a leech because you cannot afford the same things as him, who is fine with you depleting your savings to match his lifestyle, and doesn't have common sense about the limitations of money.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
