She certainly overreacted to your request, but she obviously saw you choosing to finish your work instead of sharing a hug as a slight. Was there a chance you responded to her in an uninterested, distant manner which may have riled her?\n\nBut definitely NTA.", "From what we know it sounds like NTA but make sure you two are communicating properly and you don't just take this and think you've won and move on. There are two sides. Maybe she had been feeling ignored, maybe you don't realize but you ignore her often, maybe it was longer than you thought, etc. Or maybe she's demanding and entitled, that definitely could be. But make sure she is being unreasonable and you aren't just only viewing your side. From what we know here though, definitely NTA. I'd feel differently if she came over and said, I just got some upsetting info, etc, can we talk and you still refused.", "NTA at all, she sounds like a toddler and that is hella annoying. Honestly I would have a conversation with her that you won't be having this conversation again that if you are in the middle of something her need for attention is not the priority", "Is your girlfriend a cat or something?", "NTA. Are you dating a 15 year old? Just because she\u2019s done with her phone doesn\u2019t mean you have to drop it the minute she comes to you.

She sounds really immature.", "Generally, NTA, but out of curiosity - what were you doing on the laptop?", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. She was acting like a spoiled child and I think the concern you voiced is valid.", "NTA is she a middle child? Her behaviour screams GO SEE A THERAPIST.", "NTA you basically said to her \u201csure could you wait 15 minutes? Im in the middle of something here.\u201d She says \u201cno right now. I want a cuddle right now\u201d. \n\nThe point is you acknowledged her want, and agreed but with a slight delay. She insisted on you doing exactly what she wanted the way that she wanted immediately. As in she would take no or wait for an answer. There was no compromising for her.( Ex. Quick hug and a kiss and save the rest for later) that makes her the Ah. She was acting like a demanding toddler. Those saying you should have stopped what you were doing and explain this to her are asking you to do exactly what she was demanding. Give her attention right now and finish your task later. By the time you explained that she needed to learn how to wait you would have spent 15 min or more. Because she was so insistent on getting her way she most likely wouldn\u2019t have agree with you with one or two sentences on the topic.", "Ah yes, nothing like putting down your screen and expecting your partner to immediately put down their screen in response. NTA at all. She can wait, like an adult.", "Holy crap is she a teenager?  I'm love playing The Division 2, and my wife lovers her crafts of making jewelry.  When we want attention and the other is in the middle of something, we say, \"Let me finish this, and I'm all yours.\"  You know what we do?  We show respect and let the other finish what they are doing, and when they are done, it's game on....LOL.", "NTA for wanting to finish what you were doing, but YTA for how you treated her after that statement.", "Info: what were you do?  If it were work, you are justified.  If it was just looking at ebay or YouTube, you could have let her sit on your lap", "NTA", "Info: What exactly were you doing and for how long had you been doing it?", "I think more context would be helpful - OP are you generally someone with good time management skills? When you say 15 minutes, is that an accurate assessment of how much more time you need? I ask because that's something I struggle with, and if unaddressed it can cause reasonable frustration for your partner.", "NTA for wanting to finish before giving her attention (assuming she wasnt trying to talk to you about something important)\n\nYTA for calling her a child.  That's never an effective way to communicate with your partner. \n\nAlso i may have misunderstood but why couldn't you move your laptop so she could sit down? Making her wait  15 minutes to sit would make YTA\n\nYou also may be the AH if this is a pattern. If you're constantly not giving your partner attention in favor of doing your own thing and rarely compromising in that it moves you towards AH territory. Saying you have a date most weekends.... if thats your idea of giving her attention,  that could be a problem. Relationships require more attention than one date most weekends and going out every now and then", "NTA but i think you both were childish about this situation", "NTA I guess but I'd love a woman like this. I'd have told her to sit on my lap, snuggle and rest her head on my shoulder while I finish this stuff...and if she blocks the screen etc it'll take longer lol.

That is a valid reason in and of itself.", "Why couldn't she express why it was so important for him to drop what he was doing.

He didn't make a fuss. He committed the ultimate crime. He told her NO. How DARE he commit such a dastardly and heinous act?!?!?!  \ud83d\ude44 Obviously it's something she's not used to. So when she's bored, he has to drop what he's doing to entertain her? No matter how you sugar coat it, you're calling this man an asshole because he had the audacity, the sheer unmitigated gall to tell her, \"Hey, give me 15 minutes, I'm in the middle of something.\"  And he's the annoying one?!?! Cool story Bro \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udfff", "hugging your girlfriend isn't enforcing her entitled behaviour I-\nlook dude. I get what you're saying, I really do. I would agree with you if it was a different situation but it's really not that important. op is acting like she crossed an essential boundary by saying \"give me attention\", and painting her as entitled when she's literally just a normal girlfriend doing normal girlfriend stuff. he could have not escalated the situation so much by just..... hugging his girlfriend. I'm not calling him an asshole for saying no, but the way he's talking about this is so annoying.", "You don't get what I'm saying, because you're still putting the onus on him. Just because she says \"Give me attention\" doesn't mean she gets attention right then. Girlfriends can be annoying AF. We still love them, but that doesn't make them any less annoying. She could have not escalated the situation by accepting that he was busy at that particular moment. The way he's talking about it is like someone who has gone through this scenario multiple times. It's frustration boiling over. She's not entitled to his attention just because she wants it right that second. She can wait 15 minutes for his attention. Saying he could have just hugged his girlfriend is disingenuous because we all know she wouldn't have stopped there. She'd have wanted a hug. Then she'd have wanted to talk, or cuddle, or any other of the myriad annoying things that girlfriends do that we accept and normally don't mind. But every now and then we get annoyed, and that's absolutely valid. No is a full sentence, unless you're talking to your girlfriend apparently..."]}
