Sure, but she annoyed me.

She doesn't get to decide how YOU live your life, then get offended by your telling her, in effect, to mind her own business.  Yes, you told her to fuck off, but as aggressive as she was being, it doesn't sound like she would have taken anything less than your being blunt and saying what you said. \n\nYou need to report this to your Human Resources department or file a complaint about her creating hostility at work because of an exchange she PUSHED, then she assumed you didn't like being single, (she's probably one of those people who think the whole damn world needs to pair up and have a romantic partner).  And now SHE is having others demean you, tease and mock you for LIVING **YOUR** FUCKING LIFE.  That is SERIOUSLY messed up behavior and she needs some serious consequences for starting shit at work and continuing to stir the pot and then, bring in other coworkers to help her stir that shit cauldron of hostility and bullying.", "NTA, what a weird situation. Your coworker was soooo out of line, and I wouldn't trust that she is even conveying it accurately to your other coworkers. Still it's super odd that they are all essentially making fun of you now and I'd consider that a hostile work environment - you should consider bringing this to HR. It sounds toxic.", "NTA.\n\nI'm honestly impressed, that is quite a list of activities and I don't think I'd be able to dredge up the energy for that list.\n\nIt sounds like you have a very full personal life, where you can meet new people and find friends who share some of your interests.\n\nI doubt the women agreeing with her have the full explanation of what preceded your comment. However, we are also missing something from your explanation, because your post doesn't describe the level of anger or aggression you had behind the words themselves.\n\nBut given the rude comments from her, f- off sounds like an appropriate response. \n\nI'd be tempted to turn it on the other ladies. Ask the one who is twirling behind you if she'd like you to see if the ballet class has space for her to join. Encourage someone to you work with to ask the other ladies if they all met their partners in the pub after work, or if they met them through hobbies.", "NTA. Normal people (not bitter/insecure/envious ones) would say something along the lines of wow, how do you fit all that in? You make me feel so lazy!", "NTA.

You did not ask her for her opinion on how to better your life.  Opinions are like buttholes, EVERYONE has one.  You do not need hers or the shit that comes out of it.

It sounds like she\u2019s the one trying to relive high school by being catty and gossiping with the other mean girls.\n\nNTA and you sound like a lot of fun.

Opinions and AH's, everyone has one, some stink.", "Okay, time to go to HR.", "NTA. Just look the coworkers in the eyes and ask them why they are so unhappy with their lives that they feel the need to interfere in yours. Misery loves company but come on. The trick is to look them in the eyes and hold their gaze.", "NTA. In fact, you are a million times more interesting for wanting to learn and do new things. She gave advice that you didn't ask for, which means she was in the wrong. Regardless, a person shouldn't live their life as though only finding a spouse is the be-all-end-all of living. I'm 40 and single by choice and have been so much happier since focusing on myself instead of trying to find a partner. Keep being awesome!", "NTA.  But you need to tell your manafmger and/or HR about this exchange, so they tell Hanna that this kind of behaviour is not acceptable.", "NTA.\n\nAlso a case in point why you keep co-workers at arms length and dont reveal anything personal.", "NTA.  Nope, this needs to go to HR.   She wouldn't shut her mouth and double downed on insulting you and is now acting like a toddler throwing a tantrum because you wouldn't put up with it.

Although you were a little over the top with the \"fuck off.\" You weren't wrong, but maybe a little less anger might've helped.\n\nShe's probably jealous of your life. If she's married, she may feel trapped and envious of your freedoms. If she's single, she probably hates that you have such an interesting and varied life, while she's constantly checking her dating apps and spending too much time on bar stools, trying to make eye contact with mediocre men.\n\n(Edited to add) We're also looooong past the time when boundaries need to be set up and respected. She does not have a right to comment on your personal life.", "NTA ... you need to report this to HR or whoever your boss is.  This is not ok", "Because people don't like interesting people?  I'm so confused.  You keep doing you, seems like you are enjoying life to the fullest. NTA.", "I\u2019ll say this, she\u2019s wrong about her advice.

Keep being you!!!!! Let karma take a whack at her.", "I'm a 34 year old man and I'd happily date someone that has those hobbies.\n\nNTA. She's just boring and lazy.", "NTA. You've got a great life, don't let your jerk coworkers get to you. I do a bunch of different activities after work too - Including ballet :) and it's not anyone else's place to comment on it. Fuck off may have been harsh - I would gray rock and just ignore all those ladies. You won't even remember their names in a few years after you or they move on to new jobs.", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing wrong with how you\u2019re living your life. It\u2019s your life, you know what you want and need. Report her to HR. She took it from a chat between coworkers to harassment.

Not like potential suitors come knocking at your door. Unless she thinks online is the only place for romance.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She was being intrusive. She is a coworker, not a friend, and your free time is none of her business. I would record her comments and  report her if she keeps this up.\n\nAnd kudos for Italian classes. I take them too and volunteer as well.", "NTA - The first piece of advice given to anyone having trouble meeting people is to engage in group activities.  Since you're doing that, I don't know what she's talking about.  Just because she likes going to the pub doesn't mean it's for everyone.", "NTA. Your private life is absolutely none of her business.\n\nWhat she is doing now is \"fostering a hostile workspace\", you should go to HR and complain about it.", "NTA. You sound amazing. I didn't have as cool of hobbies as you, but I was single into my late 20s and I got a lot of crap like this. I think some people are intimidated by single women who are happy with their lives. But her baggage doesn't entitle her to be rude to you.\n\nI would not encourage you to tell coworkers to f off because no matter what they did, it's pretty easy to get in trouble for cussing someone out.

File a hostile workplace complaint with HR.", "NTA \n\nthis is workplace harassment and I hope you are documenting it", "NTA I don\u2019t understand how a woman in her late 30s can be this immature.

She is being a nasty bully. \n\nAlso, I think she has the causation backwards - a lot of single and childfree people end up accumulating interesting hobbies and activities because they have a bit more time to do so.  She\u2019s probably jealous.  Also, an active social life with lots of interests is usually considered to be a good thing if you happen to be looking for a partner?", "NTA.

Don't sacrifice it for a shallow brat who honestly comes off as jealous and competitive.", "NTA, it sounds more like she is jealous. She did what society (or her parents) told her she had to do apparently, which was get a job and a spouse. God forbid you use your free time doing enjoyable activities. Nothing says you have to have a partner or one in a designated time frame either. Having biological children can be what pushes a lot of people to do it younger, but that is up to each individual person and no one else. You need to file a complaint with HR against all of them.

How she has the audacity to call you immature baffles me. \n\nNot a nice situation to be in. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong.", "She sounds like an insecure loser and a bully.

Good for you on all your volunteering and your hobbies.", "Telling anyone to 'fuck off' is not polite. People see far more meaning in words than they should and 'fuck off' is often perceived as angry.\n\nI'm not going to tell you if you're the asshole or not, but as you're asking... you likely already know. Asshole doesn't have to be a 'bad' thing, as long as we learn from it.", "ESH. Her reaction is bizarre if you've never said anything about your being single. But your response is an overreaction as well.   \n\n\nIf it isn't an insult that you're single, you sure reacted as if it were. I would've thrown it back to her that you doing all those things aren't to attract a partner, but to make you happy/a more well-rounded person/whatever, that is obviously not dependent on you being in a relationship.  \n\n\nHer turning other coworkers against you is a real problem, though.", "YTA for taking the bait and getting upset at what she said. Cursing in the workplace is not a good thing and will usually get you in trouble with management. Small minded people (men and women) think that the ultimate goal for everyone is to get married and have kids.
