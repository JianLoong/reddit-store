For the past year my mom has been battling with severe depression following the incarceration of my brother. He lived with her when he got locked up and she's never lived alone, so it took a toll on her mentally. He's in prison for 19 years so I don't see it changing anytime soon either. I helped her get in to therapy 6 months or so ago, following my wife making a comment about not wanting my mother here every single day. To be completely fair to my wife, it was in fact getting exhausting. My mom would show up at various times during the day without notice and hang out for hours because she didn't want to be alone and entertaining her every single day was getting super irritating. Especially given that my wife and I had zero down time or alone time. So, anyways, I got my mom in to therapy. \n\nFor the past 4 months my mom has still been stopping by but it's not nearly as frequent. She got a boyfriend now so she's only been stopping by once or twice a week and doesn't stay for more than an hour. My wife still hates it but she said she will take this over how it was any day. But 2 days ago my mom showed up in hysterics. She was completely inconsolable. Her and her BF were fighting and I guess it just made all her mental anguish flood back. She asked if she could stay the night. I ran it by my wife who said \"whatever\" and locked herself away in the bedroom (she hadn't gotten any sleep the night before). I told my mom \"you can stay the night but you need to leave in the morning. I'm going to be honest with you, my wife doesn't want you here. She hasn't been sleeping and this is inconvenient.\" She said she would leave first thing in the morning. But the next day she was even worse than the night before. She was freaking out and hyperventilating because she didn't want to go home to an empty house. Said she hadn't slept at all. She was afraid of driving on no sleep, etc and asked if she could take a nap in our bed so she could be rested for the drive (our couch, where she slept, was not comfortable). My wife said that was fine but she had better be gone by the time we got back from grocery and other errands. We left at 10am. Got home at 8pmband my mom was still sleeping in our bed. The baby was super fussy and my wife was livid. She said \"go wake her the fuck up and tell her to leave or I'm going to lose my shit. This is unacceptable.\" I tried waking my mom but she kept saying \"5 more minutes\" and turning away. My wife just looked at me and said \"I'm done with this bullshit\" and packed up the baby again and left for a hotel. She said she won't come back until I go no contact with my mom and cut the umbilical chord because my mom didn't get out of my bed until nearly midnight and then went back to sleep on the couch instead of leaving.

You need to stop letting your mom run your house. You are her son, not her emotional support animal. Your wife doesn't deserve for her life to keep getting interrupted because your mother is hysterical and fighting with her boyfriend like she's 16. \n\nETA - most grandparents would want to come over to help with or see their infant grandchild, not come over to be a drain on a new mother and her household. Your mom needs more help than she's apparently getting in therapy. Unacceptable.", "Dude... You really let your mom sleep in your marital bed. Not like, as a guest with fresh sheets and what not, but as a proverbial safety blanket because she's in hysterics. \n\nYes. YTA. It sounds like your mom needs SERIOUS help and intervention. You need to do that for her health AND your family's. Stop enabling her, now, and put your immediate family first. \n\nYour wife has been beyond supportive. Do right by her.", "YTA. Are you kidding? This has been happening for months, so you can't act like anything here was about this one specific situation.

That right there should have been your tip that she was about to lose her shit.\n\nAre you willing to get a divorce and lose your wife and kid over your mom?  The whole reason your wife wants no contact is because you failed at setting boundaries.  Your wife sees this and knows damn well nothing will change unless you force the hard no contact way...tough love.  Your mom is so codependent that you will ALWAYS be her crutch.  You are enabling her behavior each and every time you give in.  You think you are doing the right thing but really you are making it worse and worse.  It's not healthy and you're risking everything for a situation that will not change.\n\nYTA", "YTA Your mother clearly is struggling with being alone for the first time, but the solution isn't to ruin her son's home life.

YTA\n\nIf you want to repair this, I suggest you go VERY low contact with your mom and set some hard boundaries.

Too depressed to get out of your bed? Acting hysterical?  Call an ambulance.  She needs help you cannot give her and should be seen by a professional.  Your mother can find her way to your home, which means she is not completely helpless.  She needs to figure her life out and that will not happen as long as you continue to enable her.", "YTA. Your wife has been incredibly patient with this but when your mother continues to tromp all over boundaries and ignore the needs of your household, it's completely fair that she has now had enough and putting her foot down. I have empathy for what your mother is going through, but she absolutely needs to figure out how to take care of herself instead of forcing her children to be her caretakers and putting your marriage in jeopardy.", ">my wife doesn't want you here.\n\nHow dare you put this all on your wife. \n\nYou have done a shoddy job at keeping boundaries you BOTH agreed you needed to set with your mother. \n\nYour wife said \" whatever \" because you've not presented her with a choice, you basically told her your mum had drama and was staying over.

You had several opportunities to drive her home or otherwise remove her from your house and need to explain to your mother that at the beginning you were fine with her coming over and she has steadily lost privileges to do so each time by overstaying her welcome beyond the agreed times. This time she literally hid in bed to avoid leaving and has lost lost all visitation rights entirely. \n\nYou don't even have to feel bad about that because it's literally her going home and staying there or your baby getting a new stepdad eventually. You don't have a leg to stand on with your wife i'm afraid. You may need to get your mother sectioned if she's incapable of being by herself at all, and ultimately if she doesn't stop turning up you're going to need to move somewhere she can't find you. Maybe if you spell out the next steps she will understand how much harm she's doing to your marriage, but if you divorce over being a mummy's boy then any new partner is eventually going to find out.

Does she work or is she unemployed/retired? Does she have hobbies or take part in activities/sports which get her out of her home?\n\nIs your mom still in treatment (medication and/or therapy). I know you said you got her in therapy, but it is unclear if has run its course and/or she's stopped attending.  \n\nIt sounds like you should have had good cause to suspect that your mom was going to stop a good while, so did you simply leave that morning on the expectation she would leave under her own steam? Why didn't you, instead of agreeing to let your mom sleep in your bed, offer to drive her home, with her car to be returned to her/picked up on a later day?\n\nDoes your mom actually help some of the time she visits, or is she a constant drain? \n\nWhy did you tell your mom \"you can stay the night but you need to leave in the morning. I'm going to be honest with you, my wife doesn't want you here. She hasn't been sleeping and this is inconvenient.\"? Whilst apparently correct, the words themselves put blame on your wife and add a wedge between them, and telling someone already distressed that their daughter-in-law doesn't want them there doesn't sound like a good thing your mother's mental health. \n\nYou could've said something more alone the lines of 'My wife hasn't been sleeping well and isn't up for company, and we have a busy day tomorrow so you will need to leave first thing.' That could've softened the blow, providing the basic information without telling your distressed mother she was an inconvenient and unwanted.", "YTA. It's clear you'd rather coddle your mother and risk losing your wife and child.", "YTA - and I wonder if there might be a correlation with your brother never moving out and being a criminal.  I'm not saying there is but wow, the dysfunction is so deep you can't even see it.  My MIL has so infantilized my 50+ yo BIL that he can't function in normal society and has never moved out.  Your situation is beyond toxic.  But you can break this cycle for your daughter.  My wife did (sadly her sibs have not to varying degrees).  I'm very glad for your daughter that your wife is strong enough to walk away from this situation.", "Agree with everyone saying you are gling to lose your wife over this if it keeps going...\n\nHow old is your mom?

Your mother showing up unannounced is already too much", "Let me get this straight:\n\n\nShe \"can't\" stay in her own \"empty\" home, where she's lived for years, but she CAN sleep like a baby in YOUR marital bed, while you're all gone for 8 hours, and your house is empty?\n\n\nI guess there's no logic to co-dependent relationships, but how the fuck are you still taking her side?\n\n\nYTA", "YTA,  your mom has been in therapy for 6 months she should be handling things better by now.\n\nRegardless, you wife has told you in many ways for a long while now and you didn\u2019t really set or enforce boundaries all while you wife was pregnant and had a newborn.  Your wife probably has some postpartum depression too and dealing with next to no sleep.  Quite frankly even without these conditions you should have stopped your mothers outrageous behavior at your home.  \n\nAt this point your wife is completely over the whole situation, she is over you over your mother.  The only thing that will help her is not having to deal with your mother in any way.  You have a baby you don\u2019t need another one.  For her sanity she needs to go nc with your mother.  She should still allow you to be in contact with your mom, but any contact should be out of your home.  Visit your mother at her house, meet at a restaurant etc.. just keep you mom away from your wife and kid.", "ESH except your wife, who has been way more patient than you deserve \n\nIt is not your job to manage your mom's mental health. You helped her find a therapist, which is great. But it's on your mom to do the work in therapy. Likewise, if your mom shows up on your doorstep in the middle of a mental health crisis, it's not your job to manage that either. She needs to create a safety plan with her therapist. If she's hysterical and hyperventilating, she needs to go to the ER. \n\nIf you want to save your marriage, you need to set some firm boundaries with your mom and hold to them. Otherwise, you're going to be at your mom's beck and call forever, and seeing your kid every other weekend.", "YTA this sounds like a reoccurring \u201cmummy\u201d issue.

If this happens again, I would have her committed on a psych hold.  Your mom is basically saying that she isn\u2019t a whole person and she needs someone else there to make her whole whether its you, your brother or someone else.  You can\u2019t live like this and your wife won\u2019t.

You two also need to discuss how to offer treatment options to your mother to help her cope with her loss. \n\nThen, the two of you (you and your wife) need to provide the unified response setting said boundaries and offering to get her some help.

You for prioritizing your mum over your wife, your wife for demanding you go no contact, and your Mom for not respecting your boundaries.\n\nI think you need to try to improve your communications - if your mom was sleeping on the couch it sounds like you are in a fairly small home and you have a tiny baby - those things mean that having any overnight guests is a going to have a big impact on you and your wife, and boundaries around that aren't unreasonable.\n\nMaybe talk to your wife about what she would be comfortable with and also why, specifically , she is not comfortable with your mom coming round. Does she feel that you defer to your mom over her? Does she feel your mom interferes? Why does she want you to go no contact, rather than limiting the time your mom spends at yours? You need to listen to your wife's perspective and if you can better understand what, specifically, she dislikes, you will be in a better position to think of how you can be supportive towards your mom while also putting your own family first.  Talk to your Mom. Make clear that it was not OK for her to disrespect your and your wife's boundaries in the away that she did (not leaving in the morning despite you having made clear that was what you needed, wanting to use your bed (!!) and then not leaving or getting up at the agreed time. Right now, it sounds as though she is expecting you to drop everything to support her, and you are doing that, despite knowing that it upsets your wife, and her use of your bed is a huge overstep - If she wasn't able to drive then you could have driven her home, or told her to call a taxi / uber, or even suggested the she go to a cafe or library to take some time to compose herself before heading home. \n\nLook at yourself. It's natural that you want to be supportive to your mom, but you should also have that same instinct to support your wife and children and you seem to be failing on that - be honest with yourself about how much and how often that is happening, and how much your actions are likely making your wife feel like an afterthought in her own home, and in your marriage, and adjust your behaviour accordingly.  I think you need to talk to your wife about setting, and sticking, to limits and boundaries with your Mom - that might mean that your mom doesn't come to your home for the time being, but that you agree that you will visit her, say, once a week, for a limited amount of time, so that your wife isn't on edge wondering when she is going to show up and hw long it will be before you have your home to yourselves. \n\nTalk to your mom about building other support networks -it sounds as though she might benefit from seeing a counsellor on a regulars basis so she has someone she can work though her feelings with . On a practical level, if she is lonely and struggles to be on her own, she could consider joining organizations or groups near her home - that could be a book club, starting evening classes, joining a local walking group, volunteering somewhere on a regular basis - basically something that gets her out of the house and around others. Is she retired or does she work? Is she in good health? \n\nI think you need to improve your communication with them both, but also start to enforce some boundaries about your mom's behaviour. Otherwise your Mom is not going to the the only one living alone. As you say, your brother is not going to be coming home any time soon so your mom is going to have to learn to live without him in the house .\n\nWould she be open to getting a pet of some sort so she has company? Maybe she could look in to whether any local rescues are looking for foster homes, in the first instance?", "ETA - you, because your mom\u2019s comfort was more important to you than your wife\u2019s.  For letting her sleep on your (plural) bed.  If she were so tired, her own bed is a perfectly acceptable solution.  I am glad your mom is getting help.  Have you considered getting therapy yourself so that you can learn what is a healthy way to help your mom?  I get your instinct to help her.  But you cannot help her if she\u2019s taking you down with her.  Your mom for crossing boundaries and not respecting your (plural) space.  For using you as a crutch and emotional dumpster.  If you think that she is at a point where you fear for her, you need to be able to speak with her therapist and very possibly ask that she is held for evaluation at a hospital.  Your wife for demanding you go no contact with your mom (that is the only thing)", "I can see why people downvote me for having an opinion.", "NTA for letting your mom come over as majority of the world keeps family very close, but YTA for not respecting the marital space. That is a no, no in every culture and I have lived in a few countries.\n\nI grew up with a grandmother in the house and so did my friends (I was born in Romania). The grandparents only went into the marital suite if asked by the couple. They wouldn't clean the room or even put clothes away in there as to not invade the privacy of the married couple.\n\nI think the reason people in the west can't successfully reside with their in-laws is because they lack boundaries. My grandma would make herself scarce when my mom and stepdad were in a room and would retire to her room as soon as I was asleep. This way my mom had the house to herself without noticing her. Anytime people in the west try to allow their in-laws into their homes there seems to be so much chaos, lack of boundaries and a power struggle. \n\nAnyway.... idk where I am going with this, but your mom needs to get it together before you replace your brother in her house.", "NTA, so long as you put your foot down.  It must stop.", "NAH. Your mom is grieving, as though her son died. (Its not at all unusual for this response to occur when someone we love gets sent to prison for doing something really bad. The sentence itself implies what happened was quite grave.) But, just so you know, your mom's response is \"expected.\" So counselling and support groups are healing options. The problem is that when someone close to us gets incarcerated, our shame response also kicks in and it makes it very difficult to seek assistance or accept it when it presents.\n\nAt any rate, your mother needs a clinician. So, talk to her doctor about her symptoms and responses before she runs herself off the rails. I feel great sympathy for your wife - but this isn't really about how tired she is of your mom. Its about getting your mom back to healthy. (She can't get there all by herself, after all. She needs clinical support to manage.)\n\nAgain, she's grieving. That's what has to be addressed. She made need an intake in an environment that manages such tremendous needs?", "NTA. Your efforts to support your mother through her struggles are commendable, and you've taken steps to address the impact on your family. However, the recent situation with your mother overstaying her welcome and disrupting your family routine was not entirely within your control. Your wife's ultimatum to cut ties with your mother might be an extreme reaction.", "NAH - I understand both sides here. Your mom is grieving and sounds like she\u2019s going through a horrible time mentally. She needs a lot of support right now, and if you\u2019re her only available kid or family, it makes sense that she\u2019s defaulting to you. You do need to set boundaries with her and keep them, that\u2019s non-negotiable. But I understand that you want to be there for your mom when she\u2019s going through a hard time.\n\nYour wife is frustrated, I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be more patient *now* if not for the period when your mother came over *every day* and stayed for hours. That sounds awful to have to put up with. Now her patience is understandably thin, and I\u2019m sure she feels like she can\u2019t trust your word anymore if you constantly move the goalpost for your mom. That\u2019s hard to deal with, and it\u2019s a constant stress for her, a new mother already exhausted and just trying to raise the baby.\n\nYou\u2019re in a difficult position, this is hard for everyone so it\u2019s messy and complex and hard to navigate. I think you\u2019ll have to find a more permanent solution for your mom \u2014 like if she has so much anxiety related to living alone, could she live in a group home? Or an assisted living community? Is she in any support groups for parents of incarcerated children?\n\nThese are steps you might want to help her *start,* and then start pulling back. I don\u2019t think going no contact is the answer here, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an ultimatum a spouse should pull, though I understand the circumstance that drove your wife to make it. What you need to do is be accountable for yourself and when you set boundaries, mean them. Have a day and time set aside about once a week for your mom to visit, and when she does, make it known to your wife so she can go out. You can take care of the baby and your mom while she\u2019s out that day, and give her a much needed break.\n\nOther than that time on that day, which you may decrease as time goes on to once every two weeks and so on, your life can\u2019t revolve around your mom. It simply *can\u2019t.* She needs support, obviously, but not at the expense of yourself, your wife, your marriage, your life.", "ESH except his mom. What us wrong with all these people? Its his mother. If she can sleep a few days at his home his wife shouldnt make a problem of it. What is it with all those people stating YTA. His mom raised him up and she cant even sleep one day at his sons home? The first reaction of his wife is already a red flag. \u201cI ran it by my wife who said whatever\u201d. \n\nWtf its your mother in law.

I've been with my wife for 6 years and we have a 3 month old daughter. For the past year my mom has been battling with severe depression following the incarceration of my brother. He lived with her when he got locked up and she's never lived alone, so it took a toll on her mentally. He's in prison for 19 years so I don't see it changing anytime soon either. I helped her get in to therapy 6 months or so ago, following my wife making a comment about not wanting my mother here every single day. To be completely fair to my wife, it was in fact getting exhausting. My mom would show up at various times during the day without notice and hang out for hours because she didn't want to be alone and entertaining her every single day was getting super irritating. Especially given that my wife and I had zero down time or alone time. So, anyways, I got my mom in to therapy. \n\nFor the past 4 months my mom has still been stopping by but it's not nearly as frequent. She got a boyfriend now so she's only been stopping by once or twice a week and doesn't stay for more than an hour. My wife still hates it but she said she will take this over how it was any day. But 2 days ago my mom showed up in hysterics. She was completely inconsolable. Her and her BF were fighting and I guess it just made all her mental anguish flood back. She asked if she could stay the night. I ran it by my wife who said \"whatever\" and locked herself away in the bedroom (she hadn't gotten any sleep the night before). I told my mom \"you can stay the night but you need to leave in the morning. I'm going to be honest with you, my wife doesn't want you here. She hasn't been sleeping and this is inconvenient.\" She said she would leave first thing in the morning. But the next day she was even worse than the night before. She was freaking out and hyperventilating because she didn't want to go home to an empty house. Said she hadn't slept at all. She was afraid of driving on no sleep, etc and asked if she could take a nap in our bed so she could be rested for the drive (our couch, where she slept, was not comfortable). My wife said that was fine but she had better be gone by the time we got back from grocery and other errands. We left at 10am. Got home at 8pmband my mom was still sleeping in our bed. The baby was super fussy and my wife was livid. She said \"go wake her the fuck up and tell her to leave or I'm going to lose my shit. This is unacceptable.\" I tried waking my mom but she kept saying \"5 more minutes\" and turning away. My wife just looked at me and said \"I'm done with this bullshit\" and packed up the baby again and left for a hotel. She said she won't come back until I go no contact with my mom and cut the umbilical chord because my mom didn't get out of my bed until nearly midnight and then went back to sleep on the couch instead of leaving. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA\n\nYou may have had a shot at not being TA if you had actually gotten your mom out of your bed at 8 pm instead of giving in to the \"5 more minutes\" bullshit for HOURS\n\nYou should have gotten her out, thrown the sheets in the laundry, and taken the baby\n\nIf you want to save your marriage you need to choose your wife over your mom. And make that very very clear. Every time. Your mom will hate it. She will cry and scream and beg and manipulate and show up, but your wife is right. This is unacceptable", "My kiddo still remembers when my wife lied to her about the fishing dying. That was 7 years ago! So don\u2019t do that - whilst it is obviously sad, it\u2019s also kinda low stakes and I dare say your kid will handle it pretty well when you let them know that it\u2019s gone.", "I hope she ends up divorcing you. You didn\u2019t set any boundaries whatsoever!!! She just had enough man she was honestly extremely patient not only with your mom but with you. Cut off the umbilical cord and start taking care of your wife and kid", "Yta. Your mom clearly needs more help than you can offer and this situation has been dragging on for far too long. \nYou have a three month old and an exhausted wife. Neither of you has the mental or emotional space to carry your mother through this. \n\nWhile it's okay and expected to go through a grief process after your child is incarcerated for such a lenghty time, she is not showing healthy coping skills. \n\nAnd to be hysterical over a fight with her bf? That's extreme. \n\nYou're in a tough position, but you need to protect your family here, your wife and child need you. Now more than ever. So be firm on boundaries and stop saying 'my wife doesn't want you here'. Instead say: this isn't appropriate or feasible and we cannot go on like this. I understand you're hurting mom, but we have a small baby to care for. We cannot give you the help you clearly need.", "Your mom is the asshole. \n\nYour wife is in the right here.\n\nYour mom should not be this dependent on her child for her own mental health. It\u2019s putting a huge unnecessary burden on you and your family. You and your wife have enough on your plate right now with a baby to take care of. Your mother should see that and respect it. Your mother\u2019s behavior is disrespectful and selfish.\n\nAs hard as it may be, you\u2019ve got to set boundaries with your mother for the sake of your marriage and sanity. She is a grown adult, she needs to seek help if it\u2019s that bad. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re necessarily an asshole like other people have said; you\u2019re just having trouble setting boundaries with your mother, and you\u2019re trying to help. I can empathize with that. But you\u2019ve got to put your foot down here and say enough is enough. You\u2019ve done more than enough to try to help her and she\u2019s taking advantage.\n\nI don\u2019t think going completely no contact is warranted, but boundaries definitely need to be established.", "YTA grow up.

Who says that.", "Go take your mom to a clinic, tell  your wife that you are providing her the needed help and won't go NC, but won't allow her back to your house until she can act like a healthy person in a few weeks/months (until therapist approves).

You are an AH for subjecting your wife to this, although you\u2019re in a difficult situation. Your mom is absurd to dump all her overblown emotional baggage onto you. You don\u2019t say how old she is, but can you get her into a senior living facility or something?

What u/empathy10 suggested is perfect. You don\u2019t have to cut ties with your mom, and your wife can have that space to manage her own feelings and be present for her family. No doubt you also need some support, but it goes both ways between partners. \n\nYour mom because she is clearly having serious issues with her anxiety, and needs better help ASAP. What is she doing for herself to continue her healing? Does she even acknowledge that there\u2019s a grandchild she can focus some energy on and spending time with the baby might be of benefit to everyone?
