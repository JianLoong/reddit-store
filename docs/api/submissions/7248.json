My brother was best man, my sisters were bridesmaids, and my brother had been with his girlfriend for a while, she still hasn\u2019t warmed up to me and frankly seems like she doesn\u2019t like me but I invited her as a guest.\n\nAfter the ceremony, I specifically wanted the bridesmaids, MOH, best man, and groomsmen to be seated with my husband and I, at least until the photographers were done catching candid shots. My brother went to pull up a chair for his girlfriend and I asked him not to, we needed to keep the colors matching and numbers even for the photos. \n\nHis girlfriend looked offended so I told her it\u2019d only take a few minutes and then she could join us, but right now she just needed to stay out of the shots. My brother talked to her a little before she walked to the back tables, which she didn\u2019t have to do, she could\u2019ve sat closer. My brother looked irritated, which made me slightly irritated because I didn\u2019t want him looking unhappy in the pictures, so I said he could at least pretend to look happy.\n\nI don\u2019t know why that sent him, but it did. He went off about her being shy and already feeling unwelcome in the family and I\u2019m not making it easy for her. I told him it didn\u2019t seem like she was happy to be here anyway, she doesn\u2019t seem like she wants to be part of this family at all and frankly I didn\u2019t want her unhappy expression to be permanently displayed in pictures of what\u2019s supposed to be a happy occasion, then he storms off and sits with her.\n\nI was pissed, this was supposed to be my day, it wasn\u2019t about her. Made the seating at the table uneven in the pictures anyway, but they still turned out okay. My brother isn\u2019t talking to me, even though I apologized and offered to apologize to his girlfriend. Some things I said out of anger but also feel like I should\u2019ve been granted some respect and they should know how important it was to me since they know I\u2019d been planning this day for so long. The rest of our family and friends at the table just tell me it was awkward and don\u2019t want to pick sides. So AITA?\n\nEDIT: all partners were aware and perfectly fine with waiting for pictures to be done. After the more \u201cformal\u201d candid shots were done, everyone was free to go where they wanted. Actual candid shots were going to be taken when everybody let loose and started having fun, and everyone was able to get pictures taken with friends, partners, and family. The \u201cstaged candid\u201d shots were specifically to be framed and put up in our house, so I preferred only the people involved in the wedding to be in those. Everything else would be put in an album and also shared with friends and family who might want to print theirs out. My brother and his girlfriend are still in many of the pictures, for the record I don\u2019t think she was actively trying to get in the shot or mess anything up.\n\nEDIT2: my brother and his girlfriend have been together around a year, further info in my comment responding to this question. And for anyone confused by the staged candid photos, I understand it sounds pretentious but it\u2019s not easy taking actual candid shots of 10 people without at least one person looking like they\u2019re in the middle of a sneeze or something.", "created_utc": 1673637518, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10b2wbi/aita_for_not_letting_my_brothers_gf_sit_with_us/", "score": 3231, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP asked her brothers gf to give them a few minutes to wrap up the pictures before joing them - seems to me to be a reasonable request.\n\nSome of OP's comments weren't the best but I am still going with NTA because if her brother's gf would have simply waited a few minutes, none of the rest would have happened.", "NTA\n\nShe wasn't in the wedding party.

It would be weird to have one guest in the pictures while everyone else is the wedding party, no one does that.\n\nPictures don't take that long and everyone paid lots of money to buy the matching dresses or suits. It looks weird when there's only one person that wasn't a bridesmaid or groomsmen just standing there in a non-matching outfit. You aren't close to the girlfriend and had your wedding party picked out. The weddings I've been to, none of the wedding party ask their girlfriend or boyfriend be included even if the person getting married is their sibling. It's completely normal", "NTA.

Her wanting to invite herself is entitled as fuck.", "NTA, its basic etiquette for only the wedding party to sit at the head table, and you were reasonable enough to allow her to sit after the pictures were taken. Sorry your brother and his gf took this so personally.\n\nEdit: Correction, I guess it\u2019s not that common about the wedding party being at the head table, but brother and gf should have respected how OP wanted the pictures, which IS common.

Totally ridiculous that they couldn\u2019t wait a few minutes.", "INFO: were there other spouses/significant others of wedding party members at the table?

What\u2019s the possibility of her being in the family in the coming years? Maybe 50/50 \u2026 but do you really want that face in your pictures IF they break up?

My BIL's girlfriend was not in our main bridal party photos, because she wasn't in the bridal party. She got some pictures later on after everything else was already out of the way.\n\nHow long have they been together?

I\u2019ve never been part of a wedding where my partner was also sitting at the head table. Isn\u2019t it typical to have the dates of those at a table close by (which sounds like was the case here)? Either way, you didn\u2019t say she couldn\u2019t sit there at ALL, just that you wanted to get the head table pictures first which is totally fair. GF is an adult and can manage an hour or so minding her business, drinking champagne and eating food with other guests until the photos are done and bridal party obligations are done. My husband has been in that position several times now and he\u2019s never made it about himself. If he doesn\u2019t want to talk, he pulls out his phone and deals with it because it\u2019s so temporary and not worth making a scene over.", "NTA. Picturing it in my head, I wouldn\u2019t want the picture to look uneven, with mismatched colors and odd numbers on one side, either. I\u2019ve also heard that one of the biggest mistakes that brides make at weddings (sorry to say) is including girlfriends and boyfriends in all of the important pictures\u2014they break up a couple years later, and then they\u2019re forever framed in your big day! You were in the right, and you even tried to apologize. Your brother will get over it.", "NTA, \n\nIf it was just for photos, it's not like you said she couldn't come up at all.   It sounds like it was part of the wedding photo shoot, and it would be weird to just plant some random in those so I don't know why ones set at a dinner table would be different.   \n\nHowever it sounds like there's more going on with the gf and you.   Perhaps you two could meet for coffee and genuinely try to get to know each other without everyone else around.", "Leaning NTA since you communicated that the exclusion would be brief for the purpose of wedding party photos. \u201cIt\u2019s my day/I want it to be special/I planned so long\u201d only goes so far, but wedding party photos are fairly standard.", "Ohhh...you're NTA for having planned your day the way you did and most certainly for only having who you want at the table. I get that. However, as someone who has been 'the gf' at my now husband's brother's wedding, I can understand how she feels.\n\nI had the same experience, where the bride was asking for 'family' in the photos then pulling in her friends, to which my SIL grabbed me and the bride made a point of saying how I wasn't family! My SIL had none of it and said that she wouldn't be in the pics without me.\n\nThe ironic thing is, that me and my husband are still together and unfortunately, they are not.\n\nWhen it came to my wedding, I decided that I would have everyone in the photos regardless, so my wedding photos have my sister's then bf, but he was part of our lives then.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's up to you, but I can understand how your brother's GF felt.", "Op were there other people in the bridal party\u2019s partners sitting there as well, or was it just the bridal party? If nobody else had a partner sitting there then I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal for her to wait a few minutes to sit down.

It sounds like she knows how to manipulate your brother.", "NTA if you were getting pictures taken and she wasn't part of the wedding party and wasn't going to be in the pictures.\n\nIt isn't common for non-wedding party members to be included in wedding pictures, at least where I am from.\n\nIt's not like you told his gf to leave, or even to stay away from your brother for the entire night.  \n\nI think your brother and his gf owe you an apology for creating drama where there wasn't any, and if you feel like it's worth being gracious, you can apologize for what you said out of anger, but it's not necessary imo.", "NTA.", "NTA. \n\nI don't think it was great that a dispute over seating then became about her role/feelings about the family, but that's on both you and your brother. \n\nIt is common for the wedding party to sit separately, and I've been to a wedding where my date was at a totally different table for that reason, and a few others where dates in general were sat away. You definitely do not \"pull up a chair\" at a wedding table, regardless of the seating arrangement. \n\nYou apologize and offered to apologize to her, so now just let it lay for a little while. You are not the AH for not letting her sit with you, you had valid reasons, this is part of weddings, and it wasn't the entire evening.

You all sound exhausting.\n\nYou - 'she doesn't look like she wants to be part of this family anyway' and other such helpful comments make you an asshole.

'It's my big day' is not a get out of jail free card for being a drama llama\n\nYour brother - sitting there with a face like a slapped arse is not appropriate at a wedding. Suck it up, be polite and ask your sister later to make a proper decent effort to make his girlfriend be part of the family\n\nGirlfriend - grow up. Its the photos, not a huge metaphor for your life. Get some champagne, make some chit chat and if you are genuinely miffed slag them all off to your mates later, but don't make a drama over a nothing when there is a bridezilla on the loose who will evidently be recalling this story for the rest of your life if you stay with your partner", "NTA, you only wanted pictures for a few minutes, and then people could do what they wanted.  thats kinda common, idk why they got mad at you.", "ESH. Your brother for moving chairs around at a wedding ceremony. I mean come on.. Seats are planned for a reason.\n\nYou for being super aggressive about it. Im sure you made it clear to your brother about the photo taking, but saying things like \"pretend to be happy\" or \"she doesn\u2019t seem like she wants to be part of this family at all and frankly I didn\u2019t want her unhappy expression to be permanently displayed in pictures of what\u2019s supposed to be a happy occasion\"  makes you super obnoxious. Just make it clear that its family only, end of argument. You seem to be picking a fight with those statements.\n\nAlso it seems that you are the one that doesnt like her, not the other way around.\n\nYou seem to be making alot of assumptions on how your brother GF feels. \"Looked offended\", \"seems like she doesnt like me\", \"doesnt seem like she wants to be part of this family\"... I honestly dont think that its her fault for coming up to the table, since it was your brother that asked her over and moved the chairs. Seems like common knowledge that wedding photos should be family only, but when your brother moved the chairs she might have thought that you were ok with it. When she was there and you said no, I would feel a little irritated as well since it would look like i was being kicked around like a ball. Feels like she is the most innocent here.

Formal photos of the wedding aren't a free-for-all.  As you said, they are formal shots set up to capture the wedding party, parents, siblings, etc.  Significant others are usually excluded from those photos, and it's not a personal diss.  It's how wedding photos are set up.  As you said, it's only for a set amount of time.  Then people are free to move and sit wherever they like and candid photos of the reception are typically taken to include people at the tables, dancing, posing, etc.\n\nYour brother's girlfriend is behaving badly, and it's tough cookies, basically.  She'll need to come to terms with how weddings often work, and stop taking it all personally.\n\nWhen I married my husband, his brother was in the wedding party.  His girlfriend was not.  I didn't ever pretend to like her, so she wasn't a member of my attendants.  I invited her and tolerated her, as she wasn't the most warm and likable creature.  When they married at a later time, my husband was his brother's best man.....I wasn't in the wedding party.  I wasn't included in the formal photos, nor was she in ours.  That is how wedding photo and etiquette works.  No one took it personally!", "NTA this is not uncommon to have head tables.

I\u2019ve been to weddings where the wedding party had a plus 1 table and after pictures we mingled there. No one had an issue and there was a mix of single (brought a friend), married and committed plus ones at that table. They made friends", "NTA. You were actually extremely reasonable. I understand where the gf is coming from as I find it very hard to be around a lot of people I may not know. But you brother caused a scene needlessly because you were doing what was planned and weren't going to completely exclude her from all the festivities afterwards.", " NTA. It\u2019s pretty common for the head table to only include the wedding party. As a partner, yeah, it kind of sucks. I love spending time with my husband and would rather sit with him, especially when I have multiple little kids that I\u2019m now taking care of by myself. But it\u2019s one day, and not my day. I think you were plenty accommodating to be ok with her joining you after a few pictures and have no reason to apologize. If she is that shy then she can stand off to the side and just watch patiently while the photos are taken.", "NTA. If it doesn\u2019t work out between your brother and his gf, you\u2019ll be stuck with photographs of her hanging on your wall. And you NEVER know. I was a bridesmaid in my ex\u2019s sister\u2019s wedding. Even did her hair and makeup. The whole family took for granted that we\u2019d wind up married, and referred to me as their DIL/SIL, so I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m in every shot. That\u2019s why you NEVER have a s.o.

Discounting the fact that it was a group family photo with like 20+ other people in it who the married couple wanted to view in their home. \n\nYou\u2019re nta for not wanting a non family member/life long friend to be in permanent photos in your house.", "NTA.

Also it\u2019s a huge red flag that she\u2019d throw a fit with your bro over this. You handled it with kindness and even though she rubs you wrong you invited her to sit with you guys after photos. Weddings are expensive, each head costs a bit. What a brat.", "My wedding was a close family only type affair, and we had a bridal party head table and the rest of the family sat with whoever they wanted at the other tables.  This meant that my brother in law sat apart from his wife for the dinner as he was best man and neither of them was the least bit concerned.  My sister who was MOH was also seated apart from her then BF, (now husband).  Neither of them cared either.\n\nI think it seems to be a \"what the bride/groom says goes\" thing.  Every wedding is different in style and level of formality.  I've been to several as a guest since my own marriage and the theme running through all of them is that the day is about celebrating the couple getting married, so their wishes take priority.\n\nI think I'm going with NTA here.", "NTA\n\nNot only is it standard for the wedding party to be at the head table (if you don\u2019t opt for a sweetheart) you were only asking for it to be for picture taking! You weren\u2019t even saying they couldn\u2019t eat together or anything just for the pictures. I think your brother really went overboard on his reaction.", "NTA - my head table was only the bridle party (so bridesmaids and groomsmen) and us. It\u2019s super weird that your brother disrespected your wishes here.", "NTA. Many groomsmen and bridesmaids are paired with people they don\u2019t know from both sides even when each has a significant other. They then don\u2019t get to invite their significant other to the table. You\u2019re brothers dumb.", "NTA.  I had 1 bridesmaid ask about where her bf was going to sit, just for clarity.  It was only a big deal because they made it a big deal.", "I was kinda on your side until you said formal candid photos.  Ugh. It\u2019s too much scripted, too much control. My favorite brides are always the ones that go with the flow and appreciate the people celebrating their wedding, wanting everyone to have fun.", "Nta. It's completely normal to have the bridal party at one table even when they have a plus one.", "I've been the +1 of a groomsman at several weddings and have sat at another table while my date has sat at the head table with the wedding party. I've always thought it was weird to separate people from their date/spouses during dinner but it has been the tradition at so many weddings I've been to over the years, that doesn't make you TA. \n\nWhat does make YTA is obsessing over \"keeping the colors matching and numbers even\" at the expense of your guest's enjoyment. Friends and family are not props and while it is your special day that doesn't give you the right to be unkind to the people you've invited to share the moment with you. \n\nAlso, as someone who has been married for close to 2 decades, I want to remind every bride-to-be out there, how insignificant your wedding photos become as the years go on and when you do look back on them you likely won't see the picture-perfect symmetry. You will remember how young you all looked and how much fun you had back then and think about what happened to some of those people and relationships, for better or worse.", "Look, I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say that ESH except for your brother\u2019s gf. I actually feel bad for her. \n\nYou aren\u2019t the AH for not wanting your brother\u2019s SO at the head table or in the shots of the head table. It\u2019s pretty standard for wedding parties only to be at the head table and it was presumptuous of your brother to expect you to let him just pull up a seat for his gf. That entitlement makes him an AH. The fact that he didn\u2019t consider his gf\u2019s needs before the situation arose or talk to you about it in advance is careless and kind of inconsiderate to both his gf and you. \n\nHowever, everything after that initial action isn\u2019t a good look for you. Yes, this is \u201cyour day,\u201d but I get really tired of hearing women say that as a justification for selfish, inconsiderate behavior. \n\nIt\u2019s your day to be the focal point and to be celebrated. It\u2019s not a day where you get to completely ignore other people\u2019s feelings. You should have considered this situation before the day occurred, quite frankly. However, even in the moment, this could have been simply handled with a little compassion. Example: *\u201cHey, brother. The head table is actually just for the wedding party, but I figured that after we take a few photos of the wedding party at the head table, since your girlfriend is here and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll want to spend time with her, you could slip to this table right next to us, where I thought she would sit, as a close connection to the family and the plus one of someone at the head table.\u201d* Making his gf feel wanted and included while still asserting your boundaries would have most likely prevented this entire conflict **and made her feel welcome at your wedding, rather than an obligatory invite.**\n\nSecondly, you mention your brother\u2019s gf hasn\u2019t warmed up to you and doesn\u2019t seem to like you. Then your brother says his gf feels unwelcome in the family, **but you gloss over it like it\u2019s inconsequential to you.** Have you considered that his gf might not like you bc you come across as unwelcoming? It\u2019s incredibly hard to be \u201cthe outsider\u201d trying to work one\u2019s way into the family fold. Looking at solely how you handled this incident, if this is indicative of how you handle her, I could see why your brother\u2019s gf may feel unwelcome in your family and may not like you. **Your entire approach to the situation comes across as uncaring and cold, especially when you basically said you didn\u2019t want her unhappy face in your photos.** Nowhere in your tirade did you express concern for your brother\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s feelings, or for your brother\u2019s feelings for that matter. He\u2019s telling you that he\u2019d like his girlfriend to feel more included, and you essentially stomp your foot like a child and snap, \u201cIt\u2019s my day and I don\u2019t want you to worry about her on **MY DAY!**\u201d \n\nOP, this is your brother\u2019s gf. He cares about her. If he\u2019s been dating her a while, I\u2019d reckon he probably loves her. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s \u201cyour day.\u201d He\u2019s going to worry about her comfort and feelings because he\u2019s a decent human being and you\u2019ve basically told her, \u201cYou can\u2019t sit with us!\u201d without offering any solution that considers that she\u2019s alone at a reception full of people she doesn\u2019t know or know well/feel comfortable with, except for your brother. Think about that for a minute. She walks into a reception and sees a sea of strangers. Your brother is her anchor. Your approach was the emotional equivalent of taking a pair of bolt cutters and just snapping through the chain attaching her to the anchor she had at your party. You left her adrift in a sea people she doesn\u2019t feel connected to with no gentility or concern for her, all because \u201cit\u2019s your day and \u2026 I mean\u2026 PHOTOS!!\u201d Again, you didn\u2019t have to include her at the table, but I think a little more was warranted than you essentially saying, \u201cSit\u2026 somewhere and my brother will find you when I don\u2019t need him anymore.\u201d \n\nJust because it\u2019s \u201cyour day\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that everyone else is going to ignore their loved ones\u2019 feelings and that you don\u2019t have to put effort in to be compassionate, considerate, and emotionally intelligent. It\u2019s like you\u2019re missing the bigger picture here, pun intended, by focusing only on \u201cyour pictures\u201d and your day. The bigger picture here is the memory you\u2019re trying to make with your loved ones. When your brother looks back on \u201cyour day,\u201d is he going to remember how special and wonderful it all was, or how cold you were to his girlfriend? Is he going to trust you to be around his SO if they get closer or get married? Do you want the image of perfection on \u201cyour day\u201d and to be right, or do you want to have relationships with your siblings and their SOs and children down the road? \n\nAs a brief aside, the fact that your family says things were awkward and that they don\u2019t want to pick sides is telling. Had you behaved with grace and compassion (in the face of an entirely avoidable conflict had you considered the logistics of +1s who weren\u2019t at the head table even one time in the 2 years you were planning this thing) your family would have responded with, \u201cWe totally agree. Your brother was out of line.\u201d Had your brother not behaved in an entitled way, and had instead pulled you aside and asked where his gf should sit and expressed concern privately about her being alone, instead of assuming it was acceptable to pull up a chair for her at your head table, your family would have responded by agreeing with you. By staying carefully neutral and in saying the situation is awkward, your family and close friends are essentially saying that neither of you handled the situation well. \n\nMy advice is to let your brother calm down a bit and reach out again and apologize for not considering her needs earlier, for making her feel unwelcome, and for losing sight of the bigger picture on \u201cyour day.\u201d Tell him that in the future you\u2019ll put more effort in to make her feel welcome and included in your family. Then apologize **to his gf** for making her feel unwelcome and express that you realize you could have and should have handled the situation better. Let her know that you\u2019d like to develop a better relationship with her, especially since she\u2019s important to your brother. **AND THEN PUT IN THAT EFFORT.**", "Man he's acting like this is his partner of like 5 years, but they've only been dating for 1?

Good call in the end as she relied alot on one of my SIL during the wedding and preferred to cry quietly without people seeing it or making a big deal of it.", "You're absolutely right bless you.", "LOL great answer. And anyway, isn't it just about tradition to have wedding pictures with someone you want to photo shop out later on? I've got two, actually \ud83e\udd23", "Oh gosh, I agree.\n\nYTA to the OP and anyone who thinks it\u2019s \u2018basic etiquette\u2019 to seat someone separately from their significant other at a wedding because \u2018colours and numbers and head table\u2019. That\u2019s not etiquette, it\u2019s false, unwelcoming and downright tacky. \n\nJust because something is frequently done does not make it right. \n\nFamily bonds and actual love relationships should be what matter at a wedding. People who plan these things for two years to get the right fake candid photos for their wall are doing it wrong.", "And this was a case where she only asked for a few minutes to do the photos of the wedding party.  OP is NTA.  Sounds like the other SOs were fine with it.", "And this was a case where she only asked for a few minutes to do the photos of the wedding party.  OP is NTA.  Sounds like the other SOs were fine with it.", "We had a head table that we shared with our parents (we were lucky that both of our parents were still married to each other so no step parents) and then two second head tables that accommodated our wedding party with any plus ones or extras.\n\nI had been to too many weddings as a bridesmaid where significant others of the wedding party were made to sit at the \"extras\" table. I wanted all my guests, especially the wedding party, to have fun and be comfortable.", "US here. But \u2014 my two cents for what it\u2019s worth: This isn\u2019t how we did it when I married my ex H. I can see that I am in the minority, but our head table was: us, my MOH (wasn\u2019t seeing anyone at the time), my brother (wasn\u2019t seeing anyone at the time), and lastly our best man and his date. She wasn\u2019t even his girlfriend but I wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of splitting them up. She barely knew anyone else at the wedding. She was a lovely girl and 15+ years and one divorce later, I am still glad we included her.", "Where in OP's post did she ever say that the gf was insisting she be included in the photos?\n\nOr are y'all just writing fanfiction now?", "> western wedding\n\n*American\n\nThis particular malaise is by no means present is all of the west.", "Most of these wedding posters sound like they hate their friends and only want them for scenery and props. It\u2019s gross.", "Same!  My husband was a groomsmen on the opposite side of the country and I knew no one. I sat at a table with another groomsmen\u2019s wife and others and had to just entertain myself. It was a bit awkward and boring waiting for my husband to get done with wedding party stuff but that is just how it is", "I thought that was the only way to do things. We were tired hungry and were ready to get to the vacation part. Talking to other people\u2026 absolute no", "Most of the weddings I\u2019ve been to were like this too. Maybe it\u2019s a regional difference, like how much Bon Jovi is played during the reception.", "It\u2019s long enough to be invited lol. She\u2019s lucky she was tbh", "Except for SIL who was invited to be in the pics? Was she the only family member on that side that was having pics taken? I don't understand how you were excluded because you weren't family, but also no one from that side was included?\n\nI guess it doesn't really matter, I don't want to derail too much, I just think people read a little too much into being excluded from a wedding photoshoot.", "Depending on your location, $1k for photos might be so low that it\u2019s not even attainable unless you\u2019re getting them from a student or something. Ours were closer to 7k and this was almost 8 years ago. Our photographer wasn\u2019t even at a top tier price level. The lower tier options were about $3k, but other quotes we got were around $10k.", "I reached out to one photographer and their starting price was 12k. Slight  heartattack getting that quote first. My area ranged from 2-5k for a reputation wedding photographer.\n\nTo add, staged candids seem super fake, but it was really just all of us fake laughing stupidly enough to start actually laughing and relaxing. Way more dynamic than posed photos, way more flattering than actual candids.", "I feel like this is some trespass I would do \ud83e\udee3. I\u2019m horribly awkward and I live in fear of these social customs everyone else magically knows about. \n\nI need explicit instructions- and I mean CLEAR step by step break down. \n\nI ruined a friendship for my son by being an awkward ass in a similar way- invited to a halloween party where I showed up 10 minutes pass the invite time. I thought it was standard right? No one wants to be the first. Well I still was WAY too early.  The mom/ hostess was talking with a the only other 2 adults and she told me drinks were in the kitchen.  Punch Bowls are on the kitchen island and I see these awesome themed glasses displayed in front of the punch bowls. There\u2019s only 6 and I think she must not be expecting many people if she only has 6 glasses out \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I fill up the glass, hunt my kid down to make sure he\u2019s behaving before I join the group. She looked right at my glass like \u201care you fucking kidding me\u201d then asked if there was a reason I hadn\u2019t used the plastic cups she left out.   She took me in to the kitchen to show me where they were- on the other side of the kitchen island.  The glass I selected was decorative.  She took my cup and dumped it into a plastic one so she could wash and return to display. I apologized and she told me it was \u201cfine\u201d but she just thought it should be obvious not to use actual dishes at a party.   My son was never invited over again \ud83e\udee3 \n\nSome of us are just out here in the world being extra stupid.", "Interesting - I\u2019m getting married soon and we\u2019re definitely not an older couple. We\u2019re sitting at a large head table with our bridal party AND their guests. At least one of the plus ones will be someone I\u2019ve never met before. \n\nIt\u2019ll be a table of like 18-20 people. If we had larger bridal Parties I see how that wouldn\u2019t be feasible. \n\nI also see sweetheart tables still for my peer group, but have also recently sat at a head table despite not being in a bridal party.", "Except when you plan a wedding and you want your colors to match and to have an even number of people at your head table after paying thousands of dollars for a photographer, you are allowed to want things to be perfect. It was a couple minutes at most. I wasn't even at the head table when my dad got married, and there weren't any plus ones there either. It's all about how the bride and groom want it.", "Say it louder for the narcissists in the back", "None of this sounds like social customs any reasonable person would magically know about. The hostess sounds unbearably rude and pretentious.", "Yikes. Reprimanding a guest for using the decorative glasses is like reprimanding them for using the fancy hand towels in the bathroom. How would you know? That is not someone I would want to be friends with.", "That\u2019s a bit over the top for a mistake. I think most people would realize the glass was decorative, but she way overreacted.", "I had never been to a party where decorated dishes were on display in front of refreshments- in my defense.   \nHowever, after observing the rest of the party I was the only person who didn\u2019t go around the island to the tower of clear plastic cups.  \n\nOh! I also wore a white dress to a wedding \ud83e\udee3\nI was invited as a plus one last minute and I only owned a white sundress with black floral print all over it that I matched with black heels, vest, and belt.   I knew better than to wear WHITE, but for some reason didn\u2019t even think that it would be considered white.   No one said anything at the wedding, but after at the reception people kept coming up to me wanting the story. When I asked what they\u2019d be like \u201ccome on, I promise we wont tell\u201d \n\nThe bride actually told me. She said she hadn\u2019t thought it was white until everyone told her how upset she was suppose to be. She was very nice.   \n\nBut anyway I could absolutely see myself having a misunderstanding where I was told I could sit with my date- then when I go to sit with my date told \u201cwhat are you doing? We\u2019re taking pictures.\u201d  Unless I was told where to stand and when I could sit down- I would absolutely run as far away as possible \ud83d\ude05 I\u2019d probably be found sitting outside", "I definitely wouldn't have realised, I've never seen glasses put out to not be used, especially at a party.", "Right? My oblivious ass would be the one to make the mistake. But I also think a reasonable reaction is \u201chaha that\u2019s a decorative one, here are the drinking cups\u201d and not whatever the hell that was.", "It\u2019s actually selfish and rude to separate couples for hours at a party in your own honor.\n\nIf it was just for pictures that\u2019s fine but not all night. Not cool.\n\nFor all those saying versions of \u201cthey can suck it up for one night\u201d - why did you even invite them if you feel this way? People turn into such assholes about their weddings sometimes.", "Agreed.", "I could not agree more.  I went to more than one wedding where my now husband was a groomsmen and I sat at the misfit table.  It was awkward.  \n\nI too have been married almost 2 decades and I do not understand why these brides are obsessing over these stupid details.  \n\nYour wedding reception is just an expensive party.  Let it go ladies!", "Haha snack bar.  That was my thinking too.  It\u2019s actually kind of tricky.  On the one hand, I can see why messing with the seating arrangement would be annoying; and I suppose the bride should be afforded some deference, as long as it\u2019s reasonable.  On the other hand, I think part of the reason why you get the \u201cframer\u201d photos out of the way before dinner is to give you a chance to relax and enjoy the party.  Also, the wedding party photos are usually taken kind of apart from the rest of the guests, in theory to control the environment.  So \u201cstaged candid\u201d could be hard to pull off with the straggler guests just socializing and unwittingly messing up the shots.  So, I see why you were bothered\u2026but I\u2019m not sure it would be have been worth the trouble for me to try and stop it.", "Agreed. This seems clingy and entitled. I sat at tables with strangers, when my husband was in the wedding party. Had a marvelous time, with the other strangers.", "The photos were taking place at that time and everyone was aware that is what was happening. Had the GF sat down at the table she would have been in the photos. So while she wasn\u2019t directly stating she wanted to be in the photos, it seems odd for her and the brother to get so upset about being asked to wait to sit with everyone.", "It should have been obvious to both brother and GF. OP should not have HAD to say anything. No manners or class at all.", "Did she think she was going to swap out with her replacement? Or that you were going to have her added as an extra bridesmaid if she made it late? I mean it doesn\u2019t take a lot to know that there is an element of planning, and you don\u2019t just change things up like that mid-ceremony/event without a pretty good reason.", "Yeah, I spent more than $1k but I also got chastised by Reddit before for how much I paid for my wedding cake. (I paid approximately the standard price for a wedding cake.) So I lowballed the cost here because I didn\u2019t want to hear criticism from people.", "To be honest I can't remember. I know a number of people questioned that the bride didn't want ANY of the groom's family (including FIL who had done so much for them) in any of the photos so she relented, so to be fair it wasn't just me, then my SIL said about me and it was a massive no, which my SIL thought was was wrong. It was a bit weird for me to be honest, but I remember feeling quite uneasy, not being seen as family considering myself and my husband had been together for nearly a decade at the time. And to be honest I was really appreciative of my SIL for that. It can be hard being the one coming into a family. \n\nFair questions though! It was a fair number of years ago, and to be honest, I realised that to her, I (or my husband's family) didn't really matter, which was a shame as I know for me, my FIL is literally like my 2nd dad! And I'm so grateful that I have a really good relationship with him cos he means a lot to me in his own right.", "When you agree to be a groomsmen then you\u2019re agreeing to **play a role**. If you aren\u2019t ready for that kind of responsibility then don\u2019t accept being a groomsmen.\n\nBut yes, guests aren\u2019t just accessories to move around. But they also don\u2019t get free reign to photobomb whatever pictures they want.", " It's literally only for Dinner and speeches. Once that's over, it doesn't matter anymore", "Hear, hear!", "LOL I watched something similar this happen at a party my folks hosted except instead of being a nasty witch my mother poured herself a glass and toasted the lady. Pure class.", "Saying \"pretend to be happy\" is common when you have stroppy family members when you want a good picture to get taken though. There is nothing aggressive with this statement, it's normal for family to speak that way to each other.", "Yes. Thank you", "Wtf? No, they were terrible hosts. You're not supposed to prioritize the aesthetic of the tables over your guests's comfort.", "Are people so delicate they can't talk to a stranger for a few minutes now at dinner?", "I've been to 20-30 weddings...never been to one w a sweetheart table. Was at one with only one table cause there was only one table cause only 9 total people there and one that had no formal seating cause they just went super casual at an italian buffet place. Everything else had a head table with only the wedding party folks at that table.", "Just because you don\u2019t care about weddings doesn\u2019t mean other people are AH for caring about theirs. If you\u2019re shelling out a ton of money for a party for YOU and your spouse, you should get to dictate how it goes", "At least they get to be in the picture. In my family they are the picture takers.", "OP *thinks* she was offended at being excluded from the photos, but there is zero evidence this is the case. Her *brother* was upset over it, though. OP even states \"for the record I don\u2019t think she was actively trying to get in the shot or mess anything up.\"\n\nOP could have simply mistaken the gf's irritation with OP's brother getting a chair and waving her over, and then being informed that she's not to sit there after all, with being offended. And I'd be irritated with my SO if it happened to me, too. They disrupted the wedding enough that the bride had to intervene? My SO would get an earful from me for being such a bad wedding party member later, believe me.\n\nThe only one we know to have been upset is OP's brother.", "When one of my husband\u2019s best childhood friends got married he was a groomsman and I got stuck sitting with bridal party dates and a couple cousins, none of whom I knew (instead of with some of my old friends that I knew in school). It was awkward for a bit but I made the best of it until he was done with formal picture obligations and the party got going. I\u2019m pretty anxious and awkward in situations like that but I know how to deal with it like a grownup.", "Guests shouldn't be used as decoration. Hosts have a duty to be hospitable, even at weddings.", "I've never been to a party with decorative glasses. \n\nI guess I would actually consider them rude. ( We have these nice glasses, but you are not good enough to use them. You are so much below us that you are only allowed to look at them, and then use the plastic cups provided for you lowly people).", "A very obvious floral print dress on white background is not considered white unless people are AHs. Again, your mistake is not a social fauxpas, but that you associate with AHs.", "I\u2019m going to be generous to the host and assume  the glasses had decorations pertinent to the theme. Like greenery in a fruit spread, for decoration not consumption. But I do think it\u2019s ridiculous that the host couldn\u2019t conceive that someone would use a glass as a glass and then proceed to be rude to them,"]}
