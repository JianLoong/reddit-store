{"id": 7248, "submission_id": "10b2wbi", "title": "AITA for not letting my brothers gf sit with us at my wedding?", "selftext": "So I just got married and I\u2019ve been planning this wedding for almost 2 years, I wanted it to be perfect. My brother was best man, my sisters were bridesmaids, and my brother had been with his girlfriend for a while, she still hasn\u2019t warmed up to me and frankly seems like she doesn\u2019t like me but I invited her as a guest.\n\nAfter the ceremony, I specifically wanted the bridesmaids, MOH, best man, and groomsmen to be seated with my husband and I, at least until the photographers were done catching candid shots. My brother went to pull up a chair for his girlfriend and I asked him not to, we needed to keep the colors matching and numbers even for the photos. \n\nHis girlfriend looked offended so I told her it\u2019d only take a few minutes and then she could join us, but right now she just needed to stay out of the shots. My brother talked to her a little before she walked to the back tables, which she didn\u2019t have to do, she could\u2019ve sat closer. My brother looked irritated, which made me slightly irritated because I didn\u2019t want him looking unhappy in the pictures, so I said he could at least pretend to look happy.\n\nI don\u2019t know why that sent him, but it did. He went off about her being shy and already feeling unwelcome in the family and I\u2019m not making it easy for her. I told him it didn\u2019t seem like she was happy to be here anyway, she doesn\u2019t seem like she wants to be part of this family at all and frankly I didn\u2019t want her unhappy expression to be permanently displayed in pictures of what\u2019s supposed to be a happy occasion, then he storms off and sits with her.\n\nI was pissed, this was supposed to be my day, it wasn\u2019t about her. Made the seating at the table uneven in the pictures anyway, but they still turned out okay. My brother isn\u2019t talking to me, even though I apologized and offered to apologize to his girlfriend. Some things I said out of anger but also feel like I should\u2019ve been granted some respect and they should know how important it was to me since they know I\u2019d been planning this day for so long. The rest of our family and friends at the table just tell me it was awkward and don\u2019t want to pick sides. So AITA?\n\nEDIT: all partners were aware and perfectly fine with waiting for pictures to be done. After the more \u201cformal\u201d candid shots were done, everyone was free to go where they wanted. Actual candid shots were going to be taken when everybody let loose and started having fun, and everyone was able to get pictures taken with friends, partners, and family. The \u201cstaged candid\u201d shots were specifically to be framed and put up in our house, so I preferred only the people involved in the wedding to be in those. Everything else would be put in an album and also shared with friends and family who might want to print theirs out. My brother and his girlfriend are still in many of the pictures, for the record I don\u2019t think she was actively trying to get in the shot or mess anything up.", "created_utc": 1673637518, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10b2wbi/aita_for_not_letting_my_brothers_gf_sit_with_us/", "score": 307, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It would be weird to have one guest in the pictures while everyone else is the wedding party, no one does that.\n\nPictures don't take that long and everyone paid lots of money to buy the matching dresses or suits. It looks weird when there's only one person that wasn't a bridesmaid or groomsmen just standing there in a non-matching outfit.

The weddings I've been to, none of the wedding party ask their girlfriend or boyfriend be included even if the person getting married is their sibling. It's completely normal", "NTA.

Either way, you didn\u2019t say she couldn\u2019t sit there at ALL, just that you wanted to get the head table pictures first which is totally fair. GF is an adult and can manage an hour or so minding her business, drinking champagne and eating food with other guests until the photos are done and bridal party obligations are done. My husband has been in that position several times now and he\u2019s never made it about himself.

You were in the right, and you even tried to apologize. Your brother will get over it.", "NTA, \n\nIf it was just for photos, it's not like you said she couldn't come up at all.

I get that. However, as someone who has been 'the gf' at my now husband's brother's wedding, I can understand how she feels.\n\nI had the same experience, where the bride was asking for 'family' in the photos then pulling in her friends, to which my SIL grabbed me and the bride made a point of saying how I wasn't family! My SIL had none of it and said that she wouldn't be in the pics without me.\n\nThe ironic thing is, that me and my husband are still together and unfortunately, they are not.\n\nWhen it came to my wedding, I decided that I would have everyone in the photos regardless, so my wedding photos have my sister's then bf, but he was part of our lives then.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's up to you, but I can understand how your brother's GF felt.", "Op were there other people in the bridal party\u2019s partners sitting there as well, or was it just the bridal party?

You definitely do not \"pull up a chair\" at a wedding table, regardless of the seating arrangement. \n\nYou apologize and offered to apologize to her, so now just let it lay for a little while. You are not the AH for not letting her sit with you, you had valid reasons, this is part of weddings, and it wasn't the entire evening.

Suck it up, be polite and ask your sister later to make a proper decent effort to make his girlfriend be part of the family\n\nGirlfriend - grow up. Its the photos, not a huge metaphor for your life.

Your brother for moving chairs around at a wedding ceremony. I mean come on.. Seats are planned for a reason.\n\nYou for being super aggressive about it.

You seem to be picking a fight with those statements.\n\nAlso it seems that you are the one that doesnt like her, not the other way around.\n\nYou seem to be making alot of assumptions on how your brother GF feels. \"Looked offended\", \"seems like she doesnt like me\", \"doesnt seem like she wants to be part of this family\"... I honestly dont think that its her fault for coming up to the table, since it was your brother that asked her over and moved the chairs. Seems like common knowledge that wedding photos should be family only, but when your brother moved the chairs she might have thought that you were ok with it. When she was there and you said no, I would feel a little irritated as well since it would look like i was being kicked around like a ball. Feels like she is the most innocent here.

My brother went to pull up a chair for his girlfriend and I asked him not to, we needed to keep the colors matching and numbers even for the photos. \n\nHis girlfriend looked offended so I told her it\u2019d only take a few minutes and then she could join us, but right now she just needed to stay out of the shots. My brother talked to her a little before she walked to the back tables, which she didn\u2019t have to do, she could\u2019ve sat closer. My brother looked irritated, which made me slightly irritated because I didn\u2019t want him looking unhappy in the pictures, so I said he could at least pretend to look happy.\n\nI don\u2019t know why that sent him, but it did. He went off about her being shy and already feeling unwelcome in the family and I\u2019m not making it easy for her.

Made the seating at the table uneven in the pictures anyway, but they still turned out okay. My brother isn\u2019t talking to me, even though I apologized and offered to apologize to his girlfriend. Some things I said out of anger but also feel like I should\u2019ve been granted some respect and they should know how important it was to me since they know I\u2019d been planning this day for so long.
