Please be careful.\n\nYour mom is crazy to not see what is going on.", "All kinds of f'd up", "I knock on my 7 year olds bedroom door before going in, it's basic manners", "Your mother is an unbelievable asshole and your stepfather is a sexual predator. Gtfo asap\n\nNTA", "Ur just as weird.  Tell him to get the fuck out of ur room and slam the door in his face", "Nta\u2026. But you didn\u2019t think it through completely. Your route assumed he wasn\u2019t being a creep. He\u2019s hoping to catch a peak", "NTA you need to buy a lock for your bedroom door. He\u2019s being really creepy.", "Your step dad is a perv. He is entering your room without knocking because he wants to catch you naked. \n\nGet a good lock ASAP. Better still move out. NTA.", "NTA, but he's a predator.", "WTF is wrong with your mother? She knows this is wrong and creepy and is making excuses for him. You should be her first concern.", "NTA\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to install a lock, just block the door with something heavy. If they ask why, ask them why they care so much.", "NTA. On another note, this seems like exactly what he was hoping would happen. Install a lock in your room. Something simple. Talk to your mother again and stress how this is not ok behaviour and borders on predatory. If you are a minor talk to child protective services about this.. This is extremely creepy and I am not sure it is \"innocent\". I too love to read naked and we should be free to do so in our pwn room with our privacy being respected.", "NTA. Your shock tactic would have worked if he wasn't doing it on purpose, which he clearly is. It's concerning as hell that your mom isn't more bothered by him just having a casual conversation with your tits out, because that's *super creepy* behavior considering that you're his stepdaughter. You need to be prepared to defend yourself if he tries to escalate, because he might see that interaction as you *wanting* him to see you naked rather than trying to shock him into giving you your privacy. If he does make any kind of advance, don't count on your mom to have your back after how she reacted to what you already told her. Depending on how old your brother is, I would suggest confiding in him so you have at least one ally. Try to record it if he propositions you, and call the police if he touches you. Stay safe OP, *and get your lock fixed*.\n\nAlso, if his previous home didn't have locks, wouldn't that mean that he'd have already learned to knock since nobody could actually prevent others from coming in?", "NTA but possibly in danger. The creepy-stepdad meter is red lined. Mm with her head in the sand is enabling sexual abuse or assault. GET OUT.", "NTA. And you stepfather is a massive, massive creep", "The dude is doing it for his own amusement. NTA \n\nNow time to be more proactive, but don't reward him as he seems to enjoy looking at you. Cover up, get the loudest alarm you can think of (one of those things for sports) and blow it whenever the creep enters your room. Maybe hearing it would wake your mother up! Maybe also get a camera,", "ESH. \nYour stepfather for constantly barging into your room to get a look at you naked; you for indulging him,  and your mom for apparently being so glad to have a husband that she's okay with him always trying to get a look at you naked.", "NTA", "\u2026.just curious, why would you think him seeing you naked/topless, would deter him from coming in your room again? His behavior already sounds creepy, like he wants to see you naked and do God knows what. Your mom is acting stupid in regards to the situation. She gives off the vibe, if he were to make a pass at you, she\u2019d blame you for it. As many commentators have said, buy your own lock for your door, if your mom pitches a fit about it, try the door wedge another commentator mentioned.", "NTA. Step father is, however, a dirty old perv.", "NTA, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to realize he views you as the target of his predatory behavior. Your mom is failing you and your step-dad isn\u2019t a safe person to be alone with.", "NTA why is your mum okay with her partner constantly walking in on her daughter naked and blames you for this? I would be getting a lock for the door this isn't normal", "He\u2019s trying to see you naked\u2026 he has no, ABSOLUTELY no reason to be entering without knocking. Sick and weird. I would demand a lock or I would be blocking my door if I were you", "NTA, your mother is pissed because she knows that this makes him the bad guy, but she doesn't want to give him up for you, she wants you to change so she can keep him.\n\nGet a door wedge and a nanny cam with audio, make it known loudly on recording that you being naked is why you blocked the door and if they argue use that recording as evidence against them in the court of public opinions aka show it grandma, aunts etc.", "Your mom and brother learned their lesson. \nIts time he learns his. Why are you weak? Its nearing \"23. We evolve in our ways to protect ourselves. Simply buy yourself a lock. Or scream bloody murder and throw shit at him when he walks in. Do NOT make hik to be the victim.  \n\nHe stood there watching? He knows what hes doing. Record your conversion about this issue with your mother, then record yourself in your room and him entering without knocking. Record his reaction to seeing you naked. Give it to the authority. Dont be a weak victim. We're tired of the same stories over and over and no one seems to learn how to save themselves.", "ESH\n\nYour mom for not confronting her spouse.\n\nYour stepdad for being a peeping tom.\n\nYou for not simply keeping your damn clothes on.", "I can't decide if you are a YTA or not but be safe.", "Yeah this is extremely creepy and inappropriate. I like the suggestion of another commenter who said to get a door wedge.\n\n>I have told my mother about this and she has said that it was because his previous home didn\u2019t have any locks\n\nIf His previous home didn't have any locks, he should be twice as careful to knock before barging into a room!!! My childhood home didn't have locks either, even on the bathrooms, and you know what we did? We KNOCKED, every time. It was never a problem.\n\nThis feels \\*at the very least\\* like your stepdad is trying to assert his authority over the space by establishing that he can walk into any room at any time without asking permission. That's the most charitable interpretation, the other possibilities are much worse.\n\nNTA but stepdad is a huuuuuuuuge one", "I'm SO tired of parents not listening and dismissing their families concerns when it comes to a new partner. It's absolutely crazy to me.", "He's blatantly trying to see her naked, obviously that's why it didn't freak him out when he stood there and why he keeps coming in without knocking at a time where it's likely she'd be getting changed.", "Or throw stuff. Like a copy of Les Miserables.", "Or get something to shove under the door to keep it forced shut!", "You can get a travel lock and door stop that will sound an alarm. They are very handy and easy to use. It is a temporary lock for any door.", "I work at a foundation for victims of domestic violence, this story is not strange to me, I have heard many of its variants. unfortunately for you it may seem like incest porn, but for many girls and boys, by the way, it is a terrible reality, including the part of not supporting the father or mother in the house, so do not dismiss that story as false very easily .", "It's definitely got fake incest porn written all over it.", "My very first thought. Like, \"I know what'll make him stop...letting him see my boobs! Genius!\"", "Yeah sorry, this one feels fake to me", "Please help this geriatric redditor out- IBTL?", "You\u2019d be surprised with redditors.", "I'm also going to add that you need to be making a scene when this happens. Call him a pervert and tell him to get out of your room. If it happens again, start posting his behavior on social media and let your neighbors put him in line.\n\nAlso, I'm assuming you would have normally been topless, but this AH behavior has kept you from being able to be comfortable in your own safe space. If that is the case, you are not AH for making yourself attired the way you normally would be.", "Fr", "Better still, move out. Take up writing lessons.", "Why does OP suck? He stayed.", "That\u2019s my dilemma, I don\u2019t \u201cborrow\u201d anything neither do I misplace anything as well.", "\u201cIt has X Days since CreepyStepDad has entered this room without knocking\u201d\n\nI like that. Drives the point home.", "People can be naked if they want in their own rooms wtf", "Same and the fact ops mum blames op for her partners behaviour is worrying", "The Tale of Genji would be a good option too. Maybe become a ghost and haunt him in his carriage while you\u2019re at it.", "Or a VHS copy of Titanic.", "Door wedge.  They're cheap. Jam a chair under the know.", "[deleted]", "Lol clearly sarcasm, obviously a joke but much love from TW", "Because she purposely took her shirt off to set someone up.", "If you can't get the lock buy a cheap door wedge - you can get one at a Home Depot-type store or possibly a Target-type store. \n\nUntil then, wedge a chair under your door knob.\n\nTell a trusted family member. This isn't OK and your mom is being a bad mom by blowing this off.", "He\u2019s trying to see you naked. He\u2019s making excuses to barge into your room for that purpose only. Protect yourself. Get a lock. Or get a wedge to shove under the door. Make sure the door cannot be opened from the outside when you are naked and when you are asleep. \n\nThis is not normal. \n\nThis is grooming behavior. \n\nHe is pushing your limits to test how far he can go. It will not stop. It will only get worse, and possibly much uglier.", "Put a stopper or wedge that chair like the commenter mentioned. The man not leaving after realising you're topless is creepy.", "Nah she purposely baited him. That's ridiculous. Just keep your damn clothes on if you have a peeping tom in the house that your mother won't deal with. Why expose yourself to someone that is obviously only there to see you naked? She's giving him exactly what he wants. That's NOT how you fix the problem.", "Ooooo!!!! That makes sense bc yea, this one is gonna go quick", "No, I have no idea what IBTL means, please help \ud83e\udd23", "So she has to keep reminding a grown man to knock when in her own space?", "She used her words and this was the nuclear option. \n\nThe fact that he stayed shows he got what he was looking for. \n\nThe fact her mum dismissed it shows that she\u2019s not safe in that house. \n\nYou\u2019re a stepfather and you are pretty much the only one here on his side. How safe are YOUR stepdaughters?", "Lol oh I thought you were poking fun at an old acronym. I was laughing because we used to use IBTL as in before the lock lol. Sorry friend!", "No worries, I'm only in my late 30s but slang makes me feel old af sometimes. It's extra funny that this one was from before my days on reddit not something the kids are saying", "Haha all good my friend, that was kinda the joke, that's a way back track lol.\n\nMuch luv TW"]}
