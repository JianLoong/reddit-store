Now the kids are expecting to go.\n\nBut they valued the WOW factor over whether we as parents thought it was a good idea. My oldest has a problem with eloping especially when he gets overstimulated, I just had to run him down after he disappeared on a hiking trail and he nearly had a total meltdown at a Christmas lights show because it was too much. I will be worried about one of my kids going overboard for the whole trip.\n\nThe cruise is in the middle of the week in May, meaning my two oldest will have to miss a week of school. In my state you can get in serious trouble for missing that much time, you can actually get fines, mandatory parenting classes, and your kids could be failed.\n\nWe also would need to get 6 passports to do the cruise which would run about $900.\n\nThe last thing is they asked us for gift ideas and we gave them a good variety of ideas from little to big and they just did their own one without consulting us.  So now we have to either 1. Take the cruise as is and risk the school fallout 2. Move the cruise to a non school time, but they would lose their $1k deposit, 3. Just cancel the cruise altogether.

The repercussions are completely on them for not so much as running this by you first. There's zero reason for you to tie yourself in knots trying to make this work.", "3. Cancel the cruise. \n\nIt seems like a curse rather than a gift. Maybe they can come with you, that way you have 1 adult/kid? During a non-school period?\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA, I have a real issue with people that give gifts like this.  It always feels like a form of control to me.  We recieved a weekend at B & B as a wedding gift, I was livid.  Basically, my in-laws mentioned to their friends we were thinking of doing a small vacation to Mackinac Island, so they bought us a room in Mackinac City.  Totally derailed our plans as I wanted us to spend our first trip there together on the island.  They even scheduled the weekend we were supposed to go.  To me that was dictating what we should be doing and where we should stay based on their ideas not ours.\n\nMy spouse did not understand why I was so upset, he said, we can just go back a different time and stay on the island. Well guess who has never been back.  It meant a lot to me to stay on the island, because it feels completely different when the day tourists leave and I really wanted him to experience it with me a as far as I am concerned it was ruined.\n\nEvery choice here is not good, so you should make the choice that is best for your immediate family, which means moving it or not going.  Frankly, you should make it known that a gift like that is completely unacceptable without discussing it with you and your spouse ahead of time without the kids around.  If they take it badly, remind them that doing something like this is controlling, inconsiderate, and will not be tolerated in the future, because it is extremely selfish on their part.", "NTA. They've given you a gift that they'd love, but with no consideration for what you might want. Not only don't you want it, but you can't even legally use it.\n\nDon't make it your problem. Give it back to them and let them deal with the white elephant.", "NTA\nCancel the cruise. Tell your parents,  thanks very much but it's not something you can do at this time,  maybe in a decade or so. Doesn't matter if the kids are expecting it your parents were way out of line here.  Just explain to the kids that it's been cancelled. And tell your parents, that any future \"experiences/ holidays\" must be approved by you first or you will cancel again and tell thw children that your parents are at fault. They knew they were handing you a costly item.", "NTA. Gift horse? Or a white elephant? Transfer the booking to their names, see if they want to take your four children on a ship for a week... This is a daft present, lots of love but little thought. I can't imagine a worse holiday for 4 small children, what are they going to gain from it? Talk to them, see if they can change it for older family, or go themselves. Sorry, but they need to lose the money on this, not you. They didn't think, and didn't listen to your suggestions.", "Info: Are they also going on the cruise or just you all?", "NTA.  I hate having others make travel arrangements for me because they make incorrect assumptions about my preferences (e.g., booking an aisle seat when I vastly prefer a window, or booking a queen bed which we find difficult to sleep well in since we are used to a king).  And what you experienced is on a much, much larger scale - I would be absolutely livid if someone booked an entire vacation and picked dates without consulting me, and then announced it in front of my children.  They really put you in a terrible position.  I would tell them that you either have to move the cruise or cancel entirely (whatever your preference is).  No way would I be going on the original dates, both because of the school issues and because I wouldn\u2019t want the parents to think that it is OK to do this sort of thing in the future. I would also sit them down and explain that while you appreciate the thought, it was not ok to book the cruise without consulting you, and definitely not ok to announce it in front of the kids.", "OMG, NTA.  On any given day.  \n\nOption #1.  Cancel altogether.  We did our first cruise in October and the homework for 2 well-adjusted kids was exhausting.  This cruise will be exhausting for you right now.  They lose $1K for not discussing it with you first, the same as you losing $900 you hadn't planned to spend.\n\nOption #2.  Move the date.  Sorry if they lose $1K, they should have discussed this first.  But this removes the school issue and buys you some time to plan.  \n\nOption #3.  Take the cruise as is....NO.  This is NOT an option.", "NTA.\n\nLike others have mentioned I would look into the cruise before making a decision about the trip. There are many kid friendly cruises that include activities/programs specifically for autistic children and others who need low stimuli and other tools. They also tend to offer enclosed play spaces that make it impossible to leave without a parent.\n\nIt may involve some planning and preparation on your part but it\u2019s possible that a cruise would allow you to have a vacation while still keeping your children safe in a way that would be extremely hard on land.\n\nAll that said - *none* of that excuses the thoughtlessness of this gift. \n\nAgain, take some time to decide how you want to address this with your parents. You know them best - what were they thinking? Is this typical of them or an extreme outliner that suggests something else is going on?\n\nRegardless of the reasoning, it would be more than understandable for this present to drastically or even permanently change your relationship with them. Don\u2019t decide out of anger or guilt - when you approach them about what\u2019s going on be calm but certain.", "I think your parents just pranked the shit out of you, what did you do in your youth that they would want revenge this badly \ud83e\udd23\n\nNTA", "NTA for feeling how you do. Its very understandable to be conflicted for those reason. On a positive, cruises do offer child care that is well overseen with tons o activities that keep the kids inside the ship, you can ok the trip with the school well in advance and get any misses assignments to circumvent the fallout. I cant speak on the passport thing but mine was 125 total, i do belive kids passpprts and about half that. Ultimately you have to do whats in the best interest for your family, even if that means moving or canceling. Your parents should understandable that.", "NTA at all. This was completely done for them and the reaction, not for you. Missing that much school is not a good idea, and asking you to spend that much money on passports, let alone to travel with small children- that\u2019s reason enough to say no we\u2019re not going. They should have thought of that before they booked it and any fallout or loss is totally on them.", "I think you should first take a breath & find out more about the cruise. Cruise ships have just about everything one could possibly need/want. They understand kids & how to manage them. Find out what the possibilities are first\u2026. Then make your decision based on facts. I truly understand your stress. Information will help.\n\nPersonally, I really appreciate your parents thoughtfulness but as a Mom of 4 \u2026 I would absolutely hate this gift. I would thank my parents profusely & then explain there are too many problems with the trip that won\u2019t be possible to solve so how would they like me to proceed. Perhaps ask them to use tixs for themselves & invite their friends, gift it to another sibling, or just cancel it. (I would offer to reimburse them for their losses)\n\nYour parents did not do this with any intent to hurt you. They thought it would be a nice gift for your family. For many families it would be a great gift. Just might not work for yours. \n\nNTA\n\neta", "NTA.\n\nA cruise, where for a week, your basically out and about in public, eating, or crammed into a cabin, with an infant, toddler, and 5-year-old, sounds absolutely exhausting.

The $1000 fee can serve as \u201cpenalty\u201d for not running it by you first. Or if the entire idea is just too stressful, you WNBTA if you declined the trip and gently explained why.\n\nOne other idea. Ask them to take the cruise WITH you, so they can help with childcare and free up some time for a couple romantic dinners, etc. Just a thought.", "As a parent of an non verbal autistic child, I understand your conflict.  Family members would constantly give impractical gifts to us/him.  I would thank them for the thought and explain why we could not use it.  My advise is to sit your parents down and explain that the cruise is impossible at this time in your life.  I have had this conversation many many times with family members.  Some \u201cgot it\u201d but some just could not put themselves in our shoes.  Looking at you MIL.", "I can\u2019t imagine a more nightmarish trip\u2014and my three sons were \u201cnormal,\u201d except that one was medically fragile. That\u2019s too young. That\u2019s too far. That conflicts with school.\n\nUndoubtedly your parents meant well, and are being very generous. But it\u2019s not the right trip at the right time.

But that trip will be an undiluted nightmare for both parents.", "NTA, as someone who likes cruises, that is a WILD gift to give someone without even testing the waters about it first. And they aren't even planning on going to help you with the kids? Good gravy. \n\nYou would not be even close to asshole territory to reschedule or cancel. They didn't ask if this was a viable vacation or even a good time. This is on them. This is an expensive lesson to ask before gifting WOW gifts.\n\nLet them be mad about it and don't feel bad at all. Even without having to work around your eldest kid's neurodivergent challenges, this is galling.\n\nAlso, while not the point: 1) depending on where you're going, you may be able to sail with your birth certificates (I'm assuming you're American based on passport price), and 2) there's definitely quiet parts of the ship that I found incredibly not overwhelming as an austic adult to the point where I seek cruising when I need to turn my brain off.", " NTA at all.

This makes me so nervous.", "NAH- I am a frequent cruiser and some of the information you have isn\u2019t correct. The cruise is more than 90 days out, so no, they would not lose their deposit. They might lose an inexpensive cruise fare, but most reputable cruise companies are fully refundable at this stage.\n\nI think they thought this would be a good idea as there is age available child care with licensed staff, all inclusive food and drink unless you choose to spend more, different ports for different scenery, and a date that would limit the number of additional children on board. You and your husband could get some down time while still traveling as a family.\n\nYour children are approx 3rd grade and kindergarten. The school may fuss but there isn\u2019t really any educational content you\u2019re going to miss at the end of the school year.", "NTA but on the school front I have a way to help if you do choose to go.\n\nYou can tell the school well in advance that you will be gone for the week and ask for a packet of work/have them complete online assignments for your 2 oldest to do while they are gone. It will be considered an excused absence if they complete the work and turn it in after your vacation. PLEASE give the teacher ample time to get it sorted out though and I believe you need to get it approved by the school/district.\n\nMy mom did this for my brother and I when we were younger and went on vacation for a week (my dad won it through his work and it was just too good to pass up) and I have given many children work as well when I was a teacher if they were going to be gone for a long time. I had a student be in Denmark for an entire 6 weeks of school but he was doing the online work and I sent him extra stuff before he left and this was before covid too", "NTA.\n\nAs a teacher, unless your kid is about to graduate high school and needs to do a specific exam, we don't care if students miss a week here and there. Happens all the time. Talk to your school and schedule the time off. Tell them you're going to see a sick relative if you need to. You only get in trouble if you don't communicate with the school.\n\nYour parents are very rude for not consulting with you over something that would require this level of planning, but their sentiment is nice at least. Maybe ask your parents to help cover the passports if it's a big issue and you don't plan on any other international trips in the next few years, explain that it's an extra unneeded and unforseen expense.\n\nAs for your kids, maybe you could use this as a goal to motivate them to improve their behaviour. Talk to a school counselor or a child psychologist about possible calming exercises.", "NTA.

Missing a week of school at what looks like kindergarten and 3rd grade isn\u2019t really a big deal.  (I\u2019d have a much different opinion in later middle school and in high school, and frankly in May there shouldn\u2019t be a lot of makeup work.)

It\u2019s more likely that he will be going to get a dessert than run off. If he eats school lunches in a cafeteria then he may already be used to eating in a loud environment. Keep in mind that you could plan your days to eat at the buffet during non-peak times. You\u2019ll need to get the schedule for the buffet to do that, they have down times.

My husband is so picky, I almost wished she'd just bought it, bless her heart!", "You can teach an old dog new tricks! \n\nAll our kids (26f,26m,29f,31m) already know we are giving them X amount of money for their wedding/down payment for a house/whatever. Our oldest son has already decided to build his own house so he got his money. The younger kids are waiting until they decide what they need/want the money for. The honeymoon was just going to be a surprise for son. I am totally on board with asking them first instead of surprising them. I understand now why it could be an issue. My husband (59) still likes to surprise kids but he will be fine \u2026 lol", "You are being thoughtful in considering such a generous gift, *and* in considering how the gift may impact their plans/desires.\n\nYou'll be great inlaws. \ud83d\ude03 Congratulations!", "and the fact that you listened to others perspectives and changed course\u2026I think you will be great :)", "\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude04", "I\u2019m still learning! Always room for improvement!"]}
