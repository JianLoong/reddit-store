She should be prosecuted.", "It raises a lot of questions, for example why she would encourage her son to keep mowing their grass after the first month of not being paid, and whether they even hired him in the first place.", "What lifelong relationship? They already have a stained relationship and see each other at most once a year. They are cordial and it's all for show.", "Cash is an option, you just don't want to.", "Look, do you want to help this family or not?\n\nI have no idea where our society got the idea that shame was a bad thing. Obviously, we don't shame people for some of the things we used to, but when people are genuinely being bad to other people, keeping it in the dark makes us complicit.\n\nIf it were me, I would go to my aunt and tell her that I know she is stiffing this guy.

I would tell her, in the family chat, that you were going to have to uninvite her family from the wedding, as it has come to your attention that a dear friend of the family, this man, has been working for her family without payment for over nine months. The money that you would have spent on her trip abroad, will be used to make this man whole.
