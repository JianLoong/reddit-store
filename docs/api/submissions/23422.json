I knew there were people like that out there, but when you read about it it hits different. \n\nConsidering he appeared to feel no guilt or shame in what he was doing and using his living situation as a sob story to not only borrow money from you, but also from others is just disgraceful. Ideally you should have made contracts for every amount he borrowed with deadlines to pay it back, failure to pay sue his sorry-not in this case- behind along with all your other colleagues. Sounds like a scheme- borrow from you, borrow more from A use some money to pay you back, borrow more from B use money to pay A back and so on. \n\nSaying no to him you NTA either he was taking full advantage and he knows it. Using you make more than him/you're single and have no family, guilting you in to letting him borrow more without paying it back first,  also shows he was taking advantage. J needs to be held accountable for his actions. I have no doubt he won't try the same thing at another work place. He used you and others as a cash cow, him crying only furthers my thoughts on him.

You assumed he was a normal person who is having a difficult time and is embarrassed to have to ask for help. But no, he\u2019s a manipulator who\u2019s conning everyone. And he must be really good at it if he got money from half of your office. \n\nThe important thing here is that it is NOT YOUR FAULT that he got caught. He lied to you that he wasn\u2019t borrowing from anyone else. If you hadn\u2019t said anything to your coworker, you would have been helping him lie and gotten sucked into his scheme. He wanted you to keep secrets for him and help him cover up his lies.

Even if he is in a really hard situation and really  does need that money, he needs to find another way. Right now he\u2019s hurting his coworkers and workplace. \n\nIn fact, I would avoid being alone with him from now on (if possible), now that you know he\u2019s a manipulative person. Don\u2019t listen to just his excuses and justifications, he\u2019s only saying this to get more money out of you.
