That's when it started, first it were small amounts then it gradually increased, I too kept giving because he returned the amount he borrowed on time as soon as we got our salary. Around 4 months back I had to buy a new laptop, phone, earbuds all together since everything I owned had become 4-5 yrs old I wanted to spend and enjoy. Due to this I did not have a lot of spare cash that month and did not want break my savings so I said No to J when he asked me to loan him a significant amt (around 35% of my monthly salary) he immediately pointed out that I earn more than him and am single and have my own house while he is married, has a small child and lives on rent and I should thus help him out. \n\nHe said I am the only colleague who considers his friend and he cannot ask anyone else for the same. He failed to return the money on time the first time since he started borrowing from me, 1 more month passed theresfter too. I did not pester him, he borrowed 2 more times without paying anything back and 2 weeks ago I and a few other colleagues were having coffee break and were planning a small trip on the weekend to celebrate and relax after a hectic month. One colleague said he would not be able to come, on digging we knew he was short on cash since he loaned J some money and I felt so betrayed that I blurted out that J took a loan from me too, this opened the flood gates and it turns out J has taken loan from nearly half of the office. This word got to HR dept soon and J had a rough meeting with HR where he was told tht while the company cannot force him to pay up to us and other members who loaned to him, he would be fired if this goes on to not frthr spoil the cmpny envrnmnt. \n\nHe immediately came to me when we were leaving the office at day end and first accused me of telling others that he borrowed from me and then demanded another loan so he could pay up to colleagues whose payments were pending since quite some time so he does not lose his job.I made a pretty good incentive last moth and had a lot of spare cash in my account but I told him no and that I feel exploited by him and it is not my fault he earns less then me or cannot manage his finances better.

He\u2019s told by HR to stop borrowing money from colleagues and pay it back, so he comes to you to borrow money duh.\n\nHis finances aren\u2019t your problem. He\u2019s obviously got himself in a fix where he\u2019s borrowing of Peter to pay Paul and it needs to stop. \n\nNTA, now you all realise what is going on. Maybe u could point him in the direction of a decent financial advisor", "J ITA in this situation. Just wow the audacity!!! I knew there were people like that out there, but when you read about it it hits different. \n\nConsidering he appeared to feel no guilt or shame in what he was doing and using his living situation as a sob story to not only borrow money from you, but also from others is just disgraceful. Ideally you should have made contracts for every amount he borrowed with deadlines to pay it back, failure to pay sue his sorry-not in this case- behind along with all your other colleagues. Sounds like a scheme- borrow from you, borrow more from A use some money to pay you back, borrow more from B use money to pay A back and so on. \n\nSaying no to him you NTA either he was taking full advantage and he knows it. Using you make more than him/you're single and have no family, guilting you in to letting him borrow more without paying it back first,  also shows he was taking advantage. J needs to be held accountable for his actions. I have no doubt he won't try the same thing at another work place. He used you and others as a cash cow, him crying only furthers my thoughts on him. He is the inhumane one expecting you and others to be his personal ATM", "Is this even real? Normally one clear default is enough to deny any further loans.", "I stopped reading at the part where you said \"J\"  immediately pointed out that you earn more than him and am single and have your own house while he is married, has a small child and lives on rent.\n\n\"J\" needs to sort his shit out!\n\nThis reminds me of a story I read some time ago about a woman, let's call her Jane, who worked hard through school and college, got a decent job earning good money, got herself a nice house and went on nice holidays. Basically enjoying the benefits of her hard work.  \nHer sister, let's call her Jill, on the other hand had a couple of kids and worked part time, if she worked at all.  \nAt some point Jill started asking Jane for money to help raise her kids, and even had the rest of her family backing her up, to which Jane pretty much refused and received abuse from her family for it.\n\nNTA.  \nTell \"J\" to sort his shit out and get his money under control so he can support his family properly.\n\nYou'll have to excuse me. Anything with borrowing money really gets to me because I helped out a friend years ago and never saw my money again.  \nI've even split Xmas presents for others with my sister, but I've had to pay up front and it's taken months for her to pay me back.  \nI'll NEVER lend anyone money again.", "NTA. Actions have consequences.", "NTA. None of you are his ATM but he thinks all of you are.\n\nWhere I work were explicitly told that we shouldn't enter into business transactions or loans of any type with colleagues. The exception is lunch, say you forget your wallet or whatever and someone loans you $20.", "NTA. Stop giving him money.. what is wrong with you?", "NTA. He never had a claim on your salary. You were very generous, and he abused your generosity, as well as that of others.", "I\u2019m sorry but I just couldn\u2019t.. \u201cfrthr spoil the cmpny envrnmnt\u201d??", "NTA\nNieve,? Yes.\nPior chouces? Yes.\n\nAsshole? No.", "I bought it when he said his son is having health problems and also I find it tough sometimes to say no and disappoint someone. I know it's bad and I should be clear, I am trying now to be more resilient in this", "I\u2019m wondering if J has a gambling (or drug) addiction. \n\nOP is definitely NTA.  It\u2019s so inappropriate borrowing from colleagues.", "Yes that's what we figured too.", "I was a fool I thought I was special and close to him since he said he cannot ask anyone else for money. Made me feel dependable on and trusted.", "Well, it's not an industry thing, we have insane hours over here in India so colleagues usually also become some of your closest friends, and ya some people do ask for help from friends during tough times, it's a very subjective thing and depends from person to person", "He had paid back on time earlier and he had been not just a good colleague but a great friend too for 2 years before all this started. I know I should have refrained when he did not return the first time but Idk why I buckled every time he asked and felt really uncomfortable saying no.", "Dude, everyone has problems.  If a coworker is asking you for money, they likely have burned everyone in their private life, never believe them.  If a non close friend and/or acquaintance asks for money, that is also likely the case.  If you do give/lend money, always be willing to give money to help without getting it back.  If someone does not pay you back, or is not actively trying to pay at least, never lend to them again.  Never lend I know there are exceptions to the rules, but they are usually extraordinarily rare.", "People that don\u2019t pay back are telling you they have issues. They may even mean well. It\u2019s just eventually it will get under your skin that you feel you are being taken advantage of. That\u2019s the feeling you want to avoid for your sake and theirs or the friendship will collapse. So do what you wish and good luck.", "ESH - you for loaning money you can't afford to lose to someone you don't know, J for borrowing money he can't pay back from multiple people that he works with and lying to everyone about it. J's money concerns aren't yours to fix, their Js. Make yourself comfortable with not getting your money back and take it as a lesson.", "Among other things, not sure if he even got a much smaller salary than you, with those habits probably debt collectors taking a big chunk of his salary each month. At least that's how it would work in my country. NTA", "NTA this is either drugs or gambling\u2026never ever loan money to colleagues. Causes drama at work ($10 for a sandwich is OK\u2026.ditto friends & family (again small amounts are ok) damages the relationship IMO", "NTA, but you are a sucker!", "NTA he is using everyone and May have some hidden vices.", "Stop feeling guilty about earning more. It\u2019s your money. All this while the money you lent him could have been earning interest or rising in stock market.\n\nNTA", "NTA! He\u2019s up to no good with the money: gambling, drugs, exploits\u2026..\n\nHe\u2019s a user, deceiver, and abusing his colleagues.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu were stupid to loan him money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"He immediately came to me when we were leaving the office at day end and first accused me of telling others that he borrowed from me and then demanded another loan \" .. report this to HR.", "That dude has an addiction,  I'm guessing gambling.", "What, of course NTA!\nHe lied to you and emotionally manipulated you by telling you that you were his only close work friend (and only person in his life) you can borrow substantial amounts of money from. He has probably used this on others too. His tears are just an extension of this.\nIf he's managed to borrow from so many people, I'm curious as to where the money is going.", "The reason he borrows from you and his colleagues is that he has not intention of paying any one back. If he asks again tell him you are not a bank and if he needs money to borrow from the bank.", "I remember that one it was on here. Jill was the golden child, iirc.", "It seems more like this guy has a gambling or a drug problem if he is going to everyone in the office, hitting them up for money. If his kid had health problems, I surmise he would be taking a lot of time off to deal with some of them, either appointments of emergencies.\n\nHe has already shown that he is lax in his priorities to pay you back, and he might have actually paid you back using money he got from someone else. Keep your wallet closed from now on. You've been super generous to loan him what you have already.", "Think about how much easier it would have been to just say no at the start.\n\nYou would still have your money.\n\nYou would not be part of work drama.\n\nYou would not need to write to Reddit for reassurance.\n\nLife would be so much simpler.\n\nNext time, think of this and just say no.", "Are you positive he's actually married and has kids? He sounds like a pathological liar. If he really does have a wife  someone should loop her in on what's going on.", "He said that to everyone so that you wouldn't talk to each other about it.\n\nOP, giving people money doesn't make them your friend."]}
