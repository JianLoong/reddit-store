J was my bridesmaid at my wedding and even gave a speech. Two months before my wedding, I picked her up from Arizona. She left her bf of 10 years, M (30M) and their three toddler children to help me set up my bridal shower. I picked her up on a Thursday, we prepared on Friday, and celebrated on Saturday. On Sunday afternoon, J\u2019s sister, another pregnant friend of ours, and I decided to go out to a local bar. With their knowledge, I invited my two best guy friends. After the bar closed at 12, we went to their apartment two blocks away, which was J\u2019s younger sister\u2019s idea. There were no ill intentions from anyone. Nothing happened. Not a look, a touch, a joke. Nothing. It was just friends hanging out with friend\u2019s friends. While there, M & J argued because he didn\u2019t want her there. As soon as she told me, we left immediately. This caused M to not allow J to attend my bachelorette party. I personally apologized but the damage had already been done. He also didn\u2019t want her to be a bridesmaid, but she eventually convinced him to let her be one and to attend both the ceremony and reception.\n\nNow, it\u2019s J\u2019s turn to get married. M claims that I bring back painful memories of that night for him. Therefore, he asked that I be removed as a bridesmaid. She later told me he\u2019s uncertain if he\u2019s okay with me even attending, but she will keep me informed. Her last message to me was, \u201cI talked to him and he doesn\u2019t have a problem with you attending the bachelorette party, so I hope you can come.\u201d I know it would mean a lot to her if I attended but I feel rejected & humiliated.

But given that she's marrying him, she's not there yet.\n\nPlease do try to maintain contact with her, if only so that if she's ever ready to get out, she'll have a friend.

He's actively alienating his wife from the people in her life so he can abuse and control her more.\n\nThis dude is bad news.

Also fair to communicate your hurts in your friendship if you guys talk freely on those matters", "NTA. Why is she marrying this controlling abusive man?
