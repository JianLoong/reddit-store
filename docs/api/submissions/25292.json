J was my bridesmaid at my wedding and even gave a speech. Two months before my wedding, I picked her up from Arizona. She left her bf of 10 years, M (30M) and their three toddler children to help me set up my bridal shower. I picked her up on a Thursday, we prepared on Friday, and celebrated on Saturday. On Sunday afternoon, J\u2019s sister, another pregnant friend of ours, and I decided to go out to a local bar. With their knowledge, I invited my two best guy friends. After the bar closed at 12, we went to their apartment two blocks away, which was J\u2019s younger sister\u2019s idea. There were no ill intentions from anyone. Nothing happened. Not a look, a touch, a joke. Nothing. It was just friends hanging out with friend\u2019s friends. While there, M & J argued because he didn\u2019t want her there. As soon as she told me, we left immediately. This caused M to not allow J to attend my bachelorette party. I personally apologized but the damage had already been done. He also didn\u2019t want her to be a bridesmaid, but she eventually convinced him to let her be one and to attend both the ceremony and reception.\n\nNow, it\u2019s J\u2019s turn to get married. M claims that I bring back painful memories of that night for him. Therefore, he asked that I be removed as a bridesmaid. She later told me he\u2019s uncertain if he\u2019s okay with me even attending, but she will keep me informed. Her last message to me was, \u201cI talked to him and he doesn\u2019t have a problem with you attending the bachelorette party, so I hope you can come.\u201d I know it would mean a lot to her if I attended but I feel rejected & humiliated.

That she has to *beg* so her best friend can attend her wedding, because he already *banned* her from the bridal party. \n\nBut you are free to pile on and say, \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate the effort and *I* am humiliated (more than you are) by all of this, so imma bow out\u201d and that is also an acceptable answer because this is messy and you don\u2019t *need* to be a part of any one\u2019s mess.

See, he wants you out. So he creates this drama, she sides (understandably, if annoyingly) with her future husband, you feel hurt & humiliated, then you do something that will feel like lashing out to her, she\u2019ll respond in kind, and suddenly you\u2019re doing M\u2019s work for him. Don\u2019t fall into that trap.\n\nShe\u2019s acting like a victim, and you should think of her that way. Don\u2019t push her away, if you can help it.", "I say go.

He sounds like a misogynistic drama queen to me.", "So from the sounds of it, maybe her fiance had a traumatic experience at some point and is taking it out on her. On some level I can understand it but he's an AH for not dealing with his own insecurities.

Healthy couples do not fight over hanging out with friends.", "Yeah that was my other point, it could be a set up on his end.

It might fall through, but I\u2019ll keep encouraging her to do what\u2019s best for her to give her a better life. You just gotta keep repeating that she deserves the best. \n\nHopefully every woman in a similar situation can realize they deserve better.", "I\u2019m sorry but, figuratively speaking, I could fly to the moon and back without my husband\u2019s knowledge and he still wouldn\u2019t blame the people who went with me for it. Hell, he wouldn\u2019t even be mad at me for going. Well okay he would be mad at me for going but only because I didn\u2019t take him with me!", "This is such an important step a lot of people fail to do when dealing with an abused loved one. Understandably so \n\nYou cannot convince your loved one to leave their abuser, you just cannot, they have to want to do it. So even tho it hurts and angers you it is so so so so so important that they know you will always love and be there for them even if you\u2019re limiting contact. \n\nWay too many people stay in abusive situations because of embarrassment and shame and feeling unable to turn to the people they love out of fear of judgement and not being believed. Even when they realize it\u2019s abuse and they need and want to leave, the friends that \u201cditched them\u201d didn\u2019t make it known, *very clearly* why they had to minimize contact and that if they ever wanted to get out \u2014 even if it\u2019s been a decade since they\u2019ve seen/talked to them \u2014 that they will fucking be there with a uhaul to get them out.", "Oh dear lord. I'm so sorry M is ruining your friendship. He needs help.", "If this is the case, what i do miss in your post and your other comments is any sign or indication that M is the controling freak he now appears to be. You're saying this comes totally out of the blue? J never told you she wasn't allowed to do stuff or M did strongly object? Or did M make her slowly disappear from \"public life\"?\n\nIf you can be 100% sure nothing ever happened earlier with M or J to sort of justify M to be upset with this night and there's nothing cultural or religious behind him not wanting her to drink or see men unsupervised than this entire scenario is weird as hell and actually makes no sense at all. \n\nIn that case J might even be in serious trouble with this guy. \n\nBut i still think we're missing out on crucial info here. In one of the comments you mention a Mormom cousin of J being present, who you don't mention elsewere. Is that a possible link? \n\nBtw, very, very, very obvious: you're NTA!", "Gotcha, then yes, I'd have to agree he sounds controlling and insecure", "And what did you and her sister, and the 2 guys spend your time doing?", "I wasn't doubting the ability to be faithful, it was the staying out late with the likelihood of having work the next day and the chances of waking up said partner or children once she got home (not intentionally or maliciously). To most men feeling like their partner respects their sleep, time and peace is golden. In this situation I think both sides have an opportunity to find a more amicable solution.", "This is a great comment and gives alot of perspective of what ops friend is likely going through. It's not a simple situation ever. Personally I'd go to the hens to support her and make sure she knows I love her  but I might dip on the wedding (with her knowledge) if he was gonna be so juvenile about it all.", "This is so understanding and empathetic. I've been there and being abused is all about choosing your battles. She's chosen this one and that says something... I hope she sees the light and doesn't go through with this wedding. But please be there when she does, whenever that may be.", "I do, too! I believe you are correct and that was my last question: is he\u2019s just that insecure and jealous? Can\u2019t imagine having to live your life where can\u2019t even have friends. Glad you got away from your controlling ex! I hope her friend does, too.", "Throughout the years she has made comments here and there. All which I could kind of reason with. Ex. She wanted to go to school. He claimed that her going to school would make it difficult on them since he is the only one that works. Understandable. She wanted to work, why make money to just pay others to watch your kids. Understandable. Wanting to have lunch with a friend why leave your kids and spend. He\u2019s the only one supporting their family. He\u2019s a great provider I want take that from him but anything outside of caring for her kids is always a slight issue.", "Going to a friends house is not a good reason? \n\n\nNTA", "Been here with my own bestie. Even at my other bestie\u2019s wedding. I took the hit dealing with the one, so the others could keep the bride oblivious to the random drama the jerk was pulling. Does it suck, fuck yes. But my job - as a mother effing besties - was to keep building her foundation up while he tried to take the rest of her down, so that when she was ready, the parts of her that needed to be were strong. And to be the place she could come to land while she built the rest back up. But maybe I\u2019m a different kind of best friend\u2026\n\nI just knew that this woman was the first (and technically only, but that was ok, bc it was a lot and we were \u201cyoung\u201d) person to show up when my mom died with a HUGE casserole of lasagne. And the one to pick me up for a night out when a cab wouldn\u2019t come to my neighborhood. And always up to be my +1, even at a moments fucking notice. So, fuck yes, I gonna *inconvenience* myself to accommodate her sometimes. Or play nice with her husband so he *lets* her hang out with me. \n\nI actually didn\u2019t once. When I was 23 my bff married a dude I just\u2026didn\u2019t like. My mom was like, oh, you hate all your friend\u2019s boy friends\u2026 So I didn\u2019t say shit. No fucking shit, at the wedding he came up to the bridesmaids and said \u201cshe\u2019s mine now\u201d. The fuck?!?  We were, ok dude. Yo\u2026 we never see her. I found out right after she had her first kid that he was seeing another woman the whole time they were dating. So, my instincts were right. Friends in common with his gf. Small world. But of course I can\u2019t tell her cause I can\u2019t see her. No fucking wonder, I can\u2019t talk to her. I can drive to her city, get her schedule and agreement, make reservations, and she will cancel on the drive over. A friend/bridesmaid lives in her city, kids her kids age. Husband *were* friends before they dated. Never sees her either. So now \u2014 I don\u2019t let myself get pushed out.", "Honestly, if I were you I'd try to find some time (ideally before the bachelorette party) to try to have a conversation with her about domestic abuse and his controlling behavior. There are some really obviously concerning things happening here, and you should try to talk to her about them before she isolates her further. There's a lot of resources for how to start that kind of conversation, it might not work but it may be worth trying.", "I don\u2019t think this is totally unfair, but it seems like an issue for J and the fianc\u00e9 that they should\u2019ve been able to settle without him forcing it to impact J and OP\u2019s friendship. And since nothing happened at the apartment, they left, and OP even apologized, I think the fianc\u00e9 is taking it too far at this point. OP was having a wedding event weekend, and she got all her buddies together. That\u2019s super normal, so it shouldn\u2019t be anything fianc\u00e9 holds against her long term. That\u2019s why I have an issue mostly \u2013 he seems to be coming from a place of control and less a place of trying to agree to a reasonable boundary.", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9much? Yikes he is TA and then some. Poor girl.", "Nah, it\u2019s okay. I was an idiot for not recognizing and staying in an abusive relationship for a very long time. I have compassion for my former self, but I was still blind and dumb and an idiot. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s mean to myself to say that. I don\u2019t take the blame for the abuse. \n\nI try to be wiser these days.", "My husband gets a say in what I do, and vice versa. Neither one of us gets the final vote on each other's behavior, and honestly our votes count for more the less often we use them.", "I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing better, but wisdom is something that usually comes with experience. Not having wisdom and ending up in an abusive relationship did not make you an idiot.", "Dude, no, this is not reasonable. \n\nThe only universe in which M\u2019s reaction to this totally innocuous social gathering is remotely rational is if J has, in the past, done some dodgy things in similar situations and it has caused issues in the relationship. Like, if M\u2019s reasoning was more \u201cJ, the last time you went out in a group with random dudes, you slept with one of them, left our kids for a month to hang out in his mom\u2019s basement, and when you came back insisted you just couldn\u2019t help yourself! I\u2019m not going through that again nor am I putting the kids through that!\u201d\u2014but having a general issue that she is hanging out IN A GROUP that happens to include men is controlling af. \n\nAgain, it would be different if she had gone somewhere alone with a guy (still not a great sign for the health of their relationship, but more like they have trust issues not just want to dictate their partner\u2019s every move), but you were present the WHOLE TIME! What is J gonna do? Bang one of these dudes in front of you? \n\nBut there is no reason this should cause painful trauma about being a freaking bridesmaid!"]}
