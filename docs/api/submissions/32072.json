Honestly, I\u2019m proud of you for not doing it keep on not paying for her medical bills! she has absolutely zero right whatsoever to even think about asking you to do anything medical for her after what she put you through during your childhood. Especially when one considers that as a parent, she was actually obligated, not only morally, but most importantly, legally to provide you with medical care, and she did not - despite being able to do it and simply just chose not to -  yet she wants you to help her with medical expenses because she\u2019s your parent ?? The nerve of some people!", "NTA - \n\n>She thinks I am being unfair and that I should help her because she is my parent.\n\nNO. What is unfair is her not taking her own damn children to the doctor when they were sick, hurt, not feeling well, etc. Hers wasn't a \"helping\" situation; It was a requirement that needed to be done because you guys literally couldn't take yourselves. Why TF should you help her with her medical bills when she wouldn't even take you to the doctor and instead let you endure pain and sickness with no help at all. Tell her if she had actually been a parent then maybe you would help her. Actions have consequences. Her actions just took a little longer to catch up with her than some. DON'T GIVE HER ANOTHER DIME.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s a new kind of abuse I haven\u2019t seen here before. \n\nYou have no obligation to pay her medical bills.

I hope you\u2019ve seen someone about your concerns now and things are improving.\n\nNTA", "NTA, not your job to cover her medical bills. It was her job to provide you medical care as a child though.", "NTA what your mom did was abusive. You owe her nothing.", "NTA. FAFO Mother dearest. All that money she saved by being a negligent parent refusing her children medical care she should be able to afford her own medical bills. Don't give her anything.", "NTA\n\nshe didn't pay yours when you were a child (she didnt even let you go), why should you pay hers now?", "NTA. she said that you should help her because she\u2019s your parent? she should have helped you with your health issues because you are her child but she didn\u2019t, she doesn\u2019t deserve help because if the situation was reversed she wouldn\u2019t do anything for you", "1000% NTA", "NTA\n\nThe wicked witch deserves Humpty Dumpty's fate. \n\nBut I have to know... did they only refuse medical care to their children?

What hypocrisy. Your parents were evil, don't pay, and when they moan, cackle like a demented witch.", "Nta but parents were.  I wouldn't pay another bill. Of course I would not have paid any. Your mom sucks. Go LC.", "NTA even if she didn\u2019t neglect you as a child. You should not be paying these bills for her.", "NTA She didn't help you when she was a parent, so reap what is sown and start practicing NO and continue to grow your shiny spine.", "Nta. That's called neglect.", "NTA.  Regardless of her behaviour to you as a child, you have never been under any obligation to pay her medical bills.  She did have responsibility as a parent looking after a minor to take you to proper medical care when you required it.  No guilt and definitely no more money to your mother.", "NTA. If for nothing other than the absolutely heartless response you got for wanting to see a doctor for a medical issue. Even if she had been great as a parent, it still doesn\u2019t create an obligation, especially not for costs such as healthcare that are unpredictable. Will she expect you to take on debt for her if required? Not reasonable.", "Tell your mother that if she can come up with a *legally defensible* reason that will stand up in a court of law as to why you were not provided needed medical care as a child, then you will *consider* paying her medical bills. But first you'll run her reasoning by a lawyer to make sure it would fly in front of a judge.\n\nFair is fair, after all. Your parents neglected your health, so why should you not do the same?
