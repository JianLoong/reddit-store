This is fine, I've heard that its better for skin and such. \n\nHowever the issue comes that she's soaking her pads in the shared bathroom every day. She soaks them as and when they need cleaning before tossing them in her wet bag. \n\nSo she'll go to the bathroom, change, toss it in the sink, and then leave while its soaking and go and do other things. Several times now I've gone into the bathroom to see her pads floating around in a bloody bath and itsl nauseating. I also hate the fact that we're washing our hands and brushing our teeth in a sink that has had her period blood in.\n\nI spoke to my brother about it but he seemed unbothered. Once he, himself, came into the bathroom and cleaned it for her because I was, in his words, \"bitching about it\". He seems happy to indulge this behaviour. \n\nI was getting nowhere speaking to him, so I spoke to my niece directly. I first asked her not to, to which her reply was \"Use the other sink,\" and when I told her it really wasn't appropriate, she told me she didn't care and that I was letting my \"internalised misogyny\" shine through. \n\nI stopped the conversation but she told her parents that I was making her feel ashamed and they have both taken her side. I've decided to let it go but the tension is still thick.\n\nAm I really that much of an asshole?", "created_utc": 1697309055, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/177w4eo/aita_for_telling_my_niece_i_dont_want_her_soaking/", "score": 972, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While the niece should not feel ashamed for her choice in re-usable sanitary devices, she is crossing boundaries when she expects that others exposed to that in a shared space to have no emotion or response to it.\n\nYou are correct.  It is not sanitary.  It is off-putting and being \"grossed out\" by that does not make you sexist or a misogynist.  It makes you a normal human reacting to a normal stimuli that would be normal to elicit a response of disgust.\n\nThe best way to draw an analogy to this to completely deflate their \"misogyny\" counter is this:\n\n*How would they feel if you chose to use \"re-usable\" condoms and soaked the used condom with all the bodily fluids in a bathroom sink that they would see when going to the bathroom and be forced to go use a different sink afterward . . . or later . . . think about as they were brushing their teeth using the same sink?*\n\nIf they reply with anything other than disgust or a newly realized empathy to your situation, then they are lying.", "NTA - Not only is it gross to leave used menstrual products in a shared space, it is also unhygienic.

That's disgusting. Just because things are natural doesn't make them less unhygienic and gross in certain situations.

Don\u2019t you have a basin or bucket she can use for soaking them instead of a shared sink that people need to actually use?\n\nI think it\u2019s weird that she doesn\u2019t rinse them before soaking them.

This is fine, I've heard that its better for skin and such. \n\nHowever the issue comes that she's soaking her pads in the shared bathroom every day. She soaks them as and when they need cleaning before tossing them in her wet bag. \n\nSo she'll go to the bathroom, change, toss it in the sink, and then leave while its soaking and go and do other things. Several times now I've gone into the bathroom to see her pads floating around in a bloody bath and itsl nauseating. I also hate the fact that we're washing our hands and brushing our teeth in a sink that has had her period blood in.\n\nI spoke to my brother about it but he seemed unbothered. Once he, himself, came into the bathroom and cleaned it for her because I was, in his words, \"bitching about it\". He seems happy to indulge this behaviour. \n\nI was getting nowhere speaking to him, so I spoke to my niece directly. I first asked her not to, to which her reply was \"Use the other sink,\" and when I told her it really wasn't appropriate, she told me she didn't care and that I was letting my \"internalised misogyny\" shine through. \n\nI stopped the conversation but she told her parents that I was making her feel ashamed and they have both taken her side. I've decided to let it go but the tension is still thick.\n\nAm I really that much of an asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
