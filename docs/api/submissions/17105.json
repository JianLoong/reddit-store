OP is allowed to set as many rules in their home as they want, but that doesn\u2019t mean the rules are kind or reasonable, and they don\u2019t get to decide how other people feel about those rules. \n\nUltimately OP IS trying to override his brother.

The brother has no privileges or entitlement here.", "Just to clarify, the \u201cnot a religion that many people practice\u201d is something you just purposefully took out of context to make yourself seem smart and correct, which you are not. \n\nThe sentence was around how not sharing a bed before marriage is rooted in misogyny and not a religion that many people practice. Aka MANY PEOPLE PRACTICE THIS RELIGION BUT YOU DON\u2019T HAVE THE RIGHT TO CLAIM THAT YOUR MISOGYNISTIC OUTDATED BELIEF IS BECAUSE YOU\u2019RE A CHRISTIAN. It\u2019s because you\u2019re misogynistic. And you clearly have no reading comprehension skills.\n\nEdit: I noticed how you only responded to me here and not about the cigarette argument. Could that be because you realize you can\u2019t win that argument, but tried to win this one by taking a sentence out of context?", "Get over yourself. If you don't believe unmarried couples should sleep in a bed together, then don't sleep in a bed with someone you're not married to. YTA", "You have the right and therefore the power to make the rules in your own home. You also have the responsibility to make just and fair rules.\n\nYour rule imposes your values on others and clearly violates the agency of your guests. In short, it's your brothers decision who he sleeps with (and the sleep partner), not yours. You recognize that by suggesting a hotel. Effectively withdrawing your hospitality and insulting them and their relationship.\n\nYTA\n\nAnd you are lucky, if I were your  brother, I would have made loud, sweet love to my partner in your bed. And when challenged I'd point out that we only agreed to sleep apart, and we aren't sleeping!", "YTA. Your house your rules but your rules exist to create power imbalances and obedience from others. Your rules are outdated and it\u2019s really not fair to impose such beliefs on others who are living in the real world. And who are not doing anything wrong.", "If they\u2019re living together/regular share it\u2019s really weird you\u2019d think splitting them up would be fine.  Not everyone believes in marriage, if you are that uncomfortable basically says you\u2019re uncomfortable with their lives all together.  Who\u2019d want to spend time with someone judging them.", "Yta", "Your house your rules.\n\nAnd YTA.", "You do know it's possible to have sex in other rooms? That just because you want them to sleep separately, they could still have a knee trembler in your kitchen?\n\nAs ridiculous as I think you are for imposing your Victorian rules on a twenty-first century couple, I'm going NAH.\n\nAs is often said on this sub, your house, your rules but it's no surprise that you brother no longer wants to visit you and he is perfectly within his rights not to do so. Expect him to stay away a whoooooole lot more often from now on. He may even decide that staying in contact is of less importance, being as you consider he and his GF to be moral degenerates\n\nThe question you need to ask yourself is: which do you love more? Your brother or your Victorian morality?", "YTA\n\nDAMN, why you do that?\nThey left traditional stuff, you not, but if you not, them are adapted to sleep in the same room together, and you should respect that.\n\nYTA, OP", "YTA you stated you don\u2019t want them sharing a room not because you don\u2019t want to hear them possibly having sex but because you think how they choose to live their life is wrong. You want to control how they live their life while they are in your home. This feels very similar to asking a trans sibling to dress like their birth gender or making a family member with tattoos completely cover them while they stay with you.", "They sleep in the same room at home don't they? What problem are you trying to solve for...this is just idiotic. But, your house your rules, I guess. It's just pointless. YTA?", "YTA", "I bet your brother and his gf obviously live together which means they already share a bed. It's a problem because it's under OP's roof. But it still doesn't make sense why you would forbid it when they already sleep together in the same bed.", "Yes, you are the AH. Welcome to what century this is...grow up, come into this century & know that people who live together share a freaking bedroom!!!", "NAH\n\nYou chose your beliefs, he\u2019s choosing his. \n\nI think both of you need to stop imposing it on others. Just now you\u2019re at a stalemate, not much you can do.", "Your house your rules.\nYTA though where do you live 1950?", "NTA\n\nWhile I can understand those saying yta, I don't think it's fair for your brother to not respect your boundary. \n\nSo what if he can't sleep with his gf for a few days? Is that more important than spending time with his sibling?\n\nI've stayed at relatives' places before and had to conform to the rules in their house, and I did so without any problem bc I respect them. It's just that simple. It's not a big deal to not get what you want for a few days, honestly.\n\nAnd cancelling on you just because he can't sleep with this gf? That's very dramatic, in my opinion.", "NTA\n\nI guarantee if the roles were reversed your brother wouldn't be getting these responses", "Maybe I am strange but huge NTA. I don't understand you guys. Even without the morality or anything, if he/she don't want a couple to sleep in his/her apartment, in one of his/her bed it is up to him/her.", "ESH, your house your rules. But your brother has a point. Letting them sleeping together doesn't mean they're going to have sex.", "Is it because your brother is into inflation?", "NAH", "nTa for asking, nTa for talking about it with your brother but if you ask them a second time not to sleep together yta.\nIt's true people evolve and times change, it's good to realise your mistakes and better yet not to make them again", "I presume that you never have a partner sleep over then?", "Nah.", "YTA\n\nNot for this post. But for being a damned dirty bot. The real founder of this account stopped using it over a year ago and, based on his post/comment history, would have no issues with their brother getting freaky. \n\nI ACCUSE YOU OF BEING A PHONEY! This is a stolen account trying to build up karma with an obviously controversial post.", "yta andby your own concept you're so if you have one or ever get one can't sleep in the same bed in your home as yu as well since you're not married.", "Her house her rules.\nThere relationship there rules", "I completely disagree. Just like OP accepts that her brother lives differently now, and can respect that. Her brother doesn't show the same courtesy. Its OP's home, and she still has more traditional views about that sort of thing. The brother should respect her views, accept them, and either take different rooms or go to a hotel\n\nThe brother is the AH here, even if I disagree with OP on a moral platform\n\nLet me put it this way. I guarantee if the roles were reversed your answer would not be \"YTA\"", "Thank you.  She can accept that her brother has \u201cadopted a different moral code\u201d, but cannot give him enough grace to let him be welcome in her home for a few nights as he lives his normal life.  This is ALL about her trying to stake out some high ground that doesn\u2019t exist. This is who your brother is. Invite him or don\u2019t. But skip with the  ridiculous sleeping arrangements. She isn\u2019t going to \u201ccatch\u201d sleeping with someone before marriage from her brother.  Grace and Tolerance lacking.", "He\u2019s not trying to force him into bed with someone, so he\u2019s really not", "This isn't about beliefs, it's about control.", "Just take the L bruh", "Smoking can cause second hand smoke so yea it\u2019s  understandable to not want it in the house. Where a couple sleeping in the same room won\u2019t risk anyone\u2019s health.", "Leviticus 21:13 \u201cAnd he shall take a wife in her virginity\u201d Different groups of Christians will have more or less strict interpretations. There are several other Bible verses both Old and New Testament that express this same view, this is just the shortest to quote on the topic. No sex before marriage is a Christian belief.", "By your logic though you are requiring the brother to take the proffered opt out. He may not want to spend the additional money or be around someone who is so obviously judging him and his gf. Also a lot of people just don't go where they aren't welcome as a couple and OP made it very clear that they aren't welcome in their home any longer. Canceling the trip is pretty logical at that point. Also going lower contact with someone openly judging on your morality is pretty valid."]}
