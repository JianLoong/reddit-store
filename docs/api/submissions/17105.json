It should be up to OP to accommodate their guest, but bro to be a gracious guest that respects their siblings beliefs in their own home. This is an interesting one and I think both siblings have been too stubborn here.", "OP is a guy. Look at his terrible little Gordon Gecko  Patrick Bateman Reddit Memoji thing.", "Your comment is very informative and astute as well. Thank you for sharing", "Smh. Almost 2k upvotes for adding literally nothing.", "its a comment on reddit who cares", "He did allow for it being his house. he is just saying from his perspective that he would choose brother over those particular rules.", "I\u2019m pretty good at figuring out the gender of OP even without further info and I agree this one seems male. Idk what Tevye is.", "OP identifies as Tevye.", "I dunno about that cause I've met a ton of women in my life who have a lot to say about their traditions and forcing them on others.\n\nI think people in general who grow up in households with that mindset tend to end up this way regardless of what their gender is.", "Especially because if they actually click the profile, the icon is male. Post history also suggests OP is male. But since they\u2019re labeling OP the AH they must be female\u2026", "What\u2019s annoying about it? It\u2019s natural to assume gender in the natural way of talking. If someone assumes, and is wrong, they can be corrected and move on. Assuming gender isn\u2019t a malicious act in almost all cases.", "Jesus, careful there, you\u2019re going to have a stroke there, stressing so much over something that doesn\u2019t matter.", "why is it bothering you so much?", "Because in the whole wide world, ONLY American Republicans don\u2019t believe in sleeping together before marriage?  You\u2019re making a lot of assumptions.", "He's literally not going? I don't know how that isn't being respectful at that point. OP's brother is rightfully annoyed that this is the hill his sister wants to die on. I think in a scenario like this most people would be annoyed as it is a relatively controlling unreasonable request. I think it's crazy to infer that OPs bro is some selfish lunatic because he wants to sleep in the same room as his long term girlfriend. Its 2023, not everyone wants to be beholden to someones religious code if they don't have to be.", "He\u2019s not forcing anyone to do anything, why don\u2019t you people understand this issue is a lot more simple than everyone is making it out to be. It\u2019s his house, he\u2019s in charge of his house. Whatever rules he wants to set are fair, the brother doesn\u2019t have to stay there but if he chooses to stay there (for free) he has to follow the rules the homeowner set. That\u2019s no different than having to follow rules at a hotel. Just because your beliefs don\u2019t match OPs doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s an asshole for standing his ground on what he believes. His beliefs are silly, that we agree on, but it doesn\u2019t make you an asshole to set rules on your property.", "Idk If my sibling assumes that I'm automatically going to be having sex with my partner just because I'm sleeping next to them in their house, I might have to rethink that relationship. If my sibling is going to hold so steadfast to that, then I'm going to genuinely rethink my position in their life, and there's in mine.\nAsking me not to have sex in your home is a completely valid boundary. Asking me not to sleep next to my long-term partner just because you have a certain set of beliefs and are scared that I'm not going to adhere to my promise to not have sex, not cool with me. \ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37", "Did OP pay for separate hotel rooms for the brother and SO?", "Eek!

One can read between the lines there.", "While you are absolutely vaild for thinking like that. I think it\u2019s important to relax so many ppl would go out their way and disrespect their siblings home like that. Siblings may have grew up together but that doesnt mean they wouldnt disrespect each other either. I too wouldve just gotten a hotel room. Its respect. Someone\u2019s home is their sanctuary.", "No. Sorry. I come from fundamental evangelism that\u2019s absolutely not what they think. \n\n1. They do not think that they have shared accountability for sin. They think everyone else is the equivalent of a child with no ethics and morals and the only thing keeping everyone else from just constantly sinning is the presence of good Christians in the world. Like, they genuinely ask things like what keeps atheists from just murdering people. \n\n2. Also, no. They need control over women\u2019s bodies because women are subservient to men, made FOR men, and need men to control and guide them. Then you add point #1 because women really can\u2019t be trusted. \n\nThat\u2019s the core of their beliefs and teaching. No one ever, not once taught me I carried partial responsibility for sin. They did teach me that without me there to \u201csave the lost\u201d they wouldn\u2019t be able to help sinning.", "Same. People really here not respecting different views. I don\u2019t even believe in waiting till marriage or whatever, but I think OP is being reasonable and it\u2019s in fact the brother who is forcing his opinions onto OP", "I don't know if I should thank you for so vividly clarifying it. I don't have to go look now, but the mental image is a lot. Sad up vote it is.", "It also gives their brother the authority to cut them off. You're not my parent. You can either respect my relationship & get over yourself or kick rocks.", "Well, he did approve of the non-arranged marriage, and marriage to the Bolshevik. It was only when the next one wanted to marry the Cossack...

I mean, HAVE YOU SEEN what He can DO for YOU? If you ONLY KNEW!", "Marriage is also a belief! Some people are together their entire lives without getting married. Would this rule still apply? What in the world does a price of paper do? Nothing. While I understand it\u2019s her house her rules, some kind of compromise or discussion at minimum needs to be had. And yes it is all about sex, because what would be the issue if it is not premarital sex?", "I just saw this show a couple weeks ago! It did start as a joke and you brought me right back there and now I'm tearing up.", "I gotchu (; \n\nBut at least Tevye realized that the world is changing and if it makes his daughters happy, maybe he doesnt have to follow *all* the traditions and let them live their own life. Op? ... Not so much.", "\"Rent-free?\" Yeah, at this point, you're just intentionally putting malice on the brother's actions. What did he ever do to you?\n\nYou must understand that financially speaking, there's a *huge* difference between staying with a close family relative and staying at a hotel. When I stay at a relative's house (at least as an adult), I *always* hand them over money as a thank you for all the trouble accommodating me because let's face it, being a host can be super hard depending on the number and the difficulty of guests. I would also be chipping in on the dinner(s) that they were gonna make during my entire stay, and now that I know how to cook, I would also be helping with the preparation, unless of course, they insist that they'd do it themselves. But even with these in mind, **it'd still be a lot cheaper than staying in a hotel**.\n\nWe don't know:\n\n1. The financial situation of the brother\n\n2. How far from OP's house the nearest hotel is (OP could be in the middle of nowhere and the brother might have to drive about a half hour to an hour to get to the nearest hotel)\n\n3. How much the per-night rates are in the hotels that are (relatively) near OP.\n\nOf course it's possible the brother and his girlfriend discussed it and came to an agreement the trip might not be worth it if they'd have to stay at a hotel just because OP's views hail from 1955. Not to even mention the judgment the brother's probably gonna hear from OP regarding his live-in situation with his girlfriend, and how he's never gonna hear the end of it unless he cuts the trip early, because you know, traditionally conservative people aren't just notoriously known for passing judgment on those who don't conform to their antiquated views, especially on family gatherings, right?\n\nOP is TA.", "Yes. The rule likely would still apply if they had been together 100 years without marriage because OP doesn't share your perspective?\n\nMarriage to them is not a piece of paper? It's a sacred bond and vow made in the eyes of OPs omnipotent creator. It is of more importance than you or I can understand.\n\nThe compromise was made very clearly and reasonably: stay in a hotel.\n\nYes ofcourse its about sex! But my point is that you are equally as concerned that they should be able to have sex if they want. It's hypocritical of you to condemn OP for being so concerned about them having sex when you are concerned about them not being able to have it.", "Listen I know you\u2019re making a wider point here. But evangelism is a massive part of scripture, a large portion of the New Testament is made up of St Paul evangelising to different groups around the Mediterranean. You can\u2019t no true Scotsman an actual tenant of Christianity no matter how distasteful you may find it or it may be. \n\nAnd yes not wearing mixed fabrics is a Christian belief, just as no sex before marriage. Just because a large amount of practicing Christian\u2019s don\u2019t adhere to it, doesn\u2019t wipe it from the slate. It\u2019s still there in the scripture, which makes it a Christian belief, even if it\u2019s not followed as widely. The largest branch of Christianity, Roman Catholicism still actively preaches abstinence before marriage, so yeah, it is a Christian belief. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re choosing to die on this hill, when you\u2019re demonstrably wrong. You don\u2019t have to follow scripture, nobody has to. But people do.", "[deleted]", "Lmfao I am Christian and I don't know a single fellow Christian who is not well over the age of 60 who believes that 2 ppl who love each other should not share a bed. So you can speak for YOURSELF but you CAN'T speak for \"Christians\" as there are so many more Christians that don't believe this ridiculously idiotic out of date crap."]}
