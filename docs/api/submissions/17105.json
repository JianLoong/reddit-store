OP is allowed to set as many rules in their home as they want, but that doesn\u2019t mean the rules are kind or reasonable, and they don\u2019t get to decide how other people feel about those rules. \n\nUltimately OP IS trying to override his brother. The default is always individuals choosing their own behavior based on their own beliefs. OP is trying to change his brother\u2019s behavior, not the other way around.

Go poll the nearest 10 or 100 Christian churches and ask their opinion on it and then tell me it's not a Christian belief.\n\n> not a religion that many people practice\n\nYou can't be serious.\n\n> outdated and damaging beliefs\n\nAgain, your opinion of the OP's belief has absolutely no weight here. \n\nThe objection here could easily be about ANYTHING. This is not a commercial transaction. The brother is asking for the privilege to stay for free at someone's house. The brother has no privileges or entitlement here.", "Just to clarify, the \u201cnot a religion that many people practice\u201d is something you just purposefully took out of context to make yourself seem smart and correct, which you are not. \n\nThe sentence was around how not sharing a bed before marriage is rooted in misogyny and not a religion that many people practice. Aka MANY PEOPLE PRACTICE THIS RELIGION BUT YOU DON\u2019T HAVE THE RIGHT TO CLAIM THAT YOUR MISOGYNISTIC OUTDATED BELIEF IS BECAUSE YOU\u2019RE A CHRISTIAN. It\u2019s because you\u2019re misogynistic. And you clearly have no reading comprehension skills.\n\nEdit: I noticed how you only responded to me here and not about the cigarette argument. Could that be because you realize you can\u2019t win that argument, but tried to win this one by taking a sentence out of context?"]}
