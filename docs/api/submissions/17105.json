OP is allowed to set as many rules in their home as they want, but that doesn\u2019t mean the rules are kind or reasonable, and they don\u2019t get to decide how other people feel about those rules. \n\nUltimately OP IS trying to override his brother. The default is always individuals choosing their own behavior based on their own beliefs. OP is trying to change his brother\u2019s behavior, not the other way around.

If you were a kosher Jewish person it would only make sense that your house guests would adhere to your dietary rules around meals. You wouldn\u2019t force it on them if you were all dining out, but in order to maintain a kosher kitchen - your brother should respect and adhere to your household guidelines while a guest. \n2. If a houseguest smoked normally, but you did not, and had a smoke free home, yet accommodated an ashtray on the back porch for example, it is only right the guest adhere to the accommodations you provide and not smoke in the house) \nIn this case, you have moral standards- from childhood that you still observe as an adult.  Your brother was brought up the same way, so he should understand where you are coming from. Though he may not adhere to those guidelines or lifestyle now, he should respect that that is how you live. You let him know the sleeping arrangements in advance, instead of just springing them on him. He may disagree and that is his choice, however, it is your choice to feel uncomfortable. He said no to your arrangement and hospitality, (you were going ti take the couch and give them the beds, which are signs of good host) and you offered an alternative if sleeping at a hotel if they\u2019d rather sleep together. \nIt may be a \u201cdifferent time\u201d to some people, but it doesn\u2019t mean the you have to break your moral code to support it.

If I was in your shoes, I would not want my brother having sex on my sheets in my house, as it would be uncomfortable. \nYour brother is an adult, and he should be able to sleep apart from his girlfriend for few nights, in order to be a good guest.

You are in every right to make the rules in your house, but at the same time he has every right to choose to sleep with his girlfriend, elsewhere - which you\u2019ve stated is not a problem for you, just that it makes you feel uncomfortable in your home. If I was in the girlfriends shoes - I would tell my boyfriend to grow up, take the guest bedroom and enjoy the visit with the brother. How sad to null and void the relationship because he can\u2019t behave like a guest for a few days. It\u2019s not like you are trying to break them up, just asking them to make the visit as comfortable as possible for all involved. Anyone who can\u2019t sleep in the same house but not in the same bed for a few days for the sake of keeping the peace is co-dependent.

Because as a lady with a wife I would be pissed if someone tried to give us separate beds, but if it was that big of an issue, I\u2019d probably get a hotel \u2026", "Same for the couple. If it was important for them to sleep together (knowing that OP is still very religious) they had to ask before if they could sleep in the same bed", "It's especially egregious one sibling to another. Parents acting like authority figures into adulthood is standard, but what gives (general) you the right to dictate my relationship and lifestyle as a sibling?", "There wolves. There castle.", "There on the stair, just there.", "Force??? Yeah ok lol", "Did the comment say anything about smoke? I think they may have edited it", "Brother is perfectly capable of getting a hotel, or respecting his sisters rules. \n\nMy sister is very much aligned with OP's values, and I would never ask to share a room with my GF (if I had one) at her house, or my parents house, or even any of my friends houses who would be uncomfortable with it. OP gave him options, but because he didn't like them he cancelled. I don't think anyone is an asshole, it's standard sibling quibbling.", "What hump?", "What knockers!", "A little mouse with clogs on. Well I declare!", "its literally what you are saying. Force their point of view on their brother", "Didn't you know that internet is the tool of satan? Why are you on reddit. You are not a true Christian. \n\nAs a true Christian you should remove all of satan's tools: start with deleting this app, throw your phone (all you need is pray), remove all mirrors from the house and only eat herbs. \n\n\ud83d\ude44", "Thank you so much for saying this. People conflate far right conservative ideas as Christian values all the time and it grinds my gears.", "Have you read Leviticus? It's full of crazy rules no Christian actually follows it. Also, Christians believe that the coming of Christ created a new covenant, and they no longer have to follow the rules of the Old Testament.", ">No sex before marriage is a Christian belief.\n\nDon't confuse people here with facts when it comes to Christianity. They heard someone say it supports sex before marriage and LGTBXYZ, so it must be so even if the BASE BOOK says otherwise. (Look, they even found pastors who have an interpretation that for 2000 years basically noone had!)\n\n*Edit: grammar*", "How is it rooted in misogyny tho,don't get me wrong i do think it's bad to police people about how they sleep but how is OP's belief rooted in misogyny", "Same reason,pretty sure overconsumption of alcohol will lead to chronic diseases"]}
