Heck I would think less of a person who was joking about it in an unprofessional setting.   This guy probably has done stuff like this more than once too.  So don't feel too bad.", "Nope, NTA. He was unprofessional and out of line with his \"joke\". He caused you stress and anxiety and as you said at the beginning he was rude on and off, so he's the AH here.", "NTA. He was careless and caught. It is someone else's decision how serious it is and the punishment.", "NTA. The dude has a weird sense of humor not to mention definitely does not uphold appropriate professional decorum, and this could absolutely be or become a much bigger issue in the future. He shouldn't be trusted to oversee students if he's going to behave that way in a professional setting. The lewdness and sexual suggestions in that joke were also way over the line and gross.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't \"joke\" about that kind of stuff. Both \"joke\" about failing you and \"joke\" about you being forced into prostitution are things an instructor should NEVER joke around.\n\nFAFO for the now-former instructor.", "NTA, but you need to understand what you can control and what you can't.  You were correct to notify your professor about the instructor's comments.  As a professor, I have learned over the years that students often give much more weight to things said by a teacher.  The instructor's note to the student crossed a line, and there's no way he should be in his position.  He wasn't joking.  But once you told the professor, you had no control over what happened to the instructor.  Plus, you're looking at it from a student's viewpoint.  In my viewpoint, the instructor's behavior was unacceptable and taking him out of that position was the right thing to do.", "NTA.", "NTA, unfortunately he did it to himself. I don\u2019t know if you HAD to report him, I probably would have just let it go bc I didn\u2019t fail. But, you absolutely had every right to do so. He could have said way worse or done worse to other people. It\u2019s his fault in the end.", "NTA - You didn't do anything.  He made a stupid post and deserves what he got.  He has a seriously lack of judgement to think that is an appropriate comment to make at work (joke or not)", "NTA. In fact, I'd say you saved your friend and other students from going through a similar experience with this instructor in the future.", "Absolutely NTA- as someone in this same field, there is unfortunately some issues with control freak / god complex instructors. That message as not only sexist and a hostile work environment issue that is reportable, but it is also a sign that this person should NOT have access to vulnerable patients. You did the right thing to report it, not reporting it could have caused others to be harmed by this person. I know it wasn't easy to report so good on you!", "NTA  The right actions were taken.", "NTA - Truth is truth, and you cannot forgive unprofessional behavior because it was \"a joke\". He was rude, and unprofessional. He needs to be forbidden from teaching.", "NTA. He got what he deserved. That\u2019s extremely inappropriate for not only a workplace, but a teacher.", "nta, i too did clinical rotations for health care along time ago and this is one of my pet peeves. Inappropriate behavior has NO place in the medical profession. I don't care if its one professional commenting \"did you see how cute that patient's sister is\"? or worse.", "He did this to himself and the consequences are correct. This isn\u2019t at all on you OP.", "NTA. He\u2019s basically fucking with student\u2019s reputations before they even graduate. You professor did the right thing an so did you!", "NAH.

Which is why he\u2019s not teaching them anymore.\n\nNTA", "I know it\u2019s a red flag, it was just a little more conflicting for me as a student as to how to handle it since I haven\u2019t graduated and gotten my license yet. The possibility of problems arising scared me at first. But you\u2019re right, definitely should\u2019ve reacted to the red flag more confidently.", "Now that I think I\u2019ve gotten over just the initial shock of it happening I\u2019m thinking this viewpoint more and more. No one else needed to go there, he\u2019s also being reprimanded by his workplace (not sure what that\u2019s going to consist of). Wondering how many students of his in the past 5 years have experienced this and just not said anything", "I was thinking the same thing. Just because he saw it as \"a joke\" does not mean that the person he was saying it to was going to know it was a joke. This could have had long lasting damage to OPs professional reputation. Still could, if that coworker was not brought in and a conversation had to let them know what the instructor said was a malicious lie.\n\nTo say nothing of how many other students he may have done something similar to in the past. Or how many he might have in the future, if he hadn't been reported.", "Now that I\u2019ve gotten over the initial shock, I\u2019m happy that he isn\u2019t going to get students anymore. I was just a little lost in the situation at first but you are right!", "NTA and he was chewed out by his superior for a reason. \n\nHe acted unprofessional and he gets to deal with the consequences.", "NTA. Yeah, no. This dude was behaving like an ass. To instruct newcomers you need to act like an adult, first.", "Nope NTA, what an idiot. The prostitute comment is really concerning. This guy\u2019s students\u2019 safety take priority over his shit \u201cjokes\u201d.\n\nNever feel bad about reporting sexual comments like this. I\u2019m glad the professor had your back, she was rightfully pissed.", "NTA, this type of comment is sexual harassment.  To say a student will work the streets because he fails them.  This shows that he feels he has power over the intern.  His being rude on and off most likely was a test to see if you would crack and be fearful of failing.  Think about what might have happened if you did not remain professional when he was rude.  Think about other students that might not have the same strength you showed to him.  You saved a lot of students a lot of harm.", "NTA.  His comments were unprofessional and inappropriate and it needed to be reported.  There should be zero tolerance for that type of behavior.  And the changes are not your fault.", "It wasn't even said to her, how would it be a threat?? Just imagine joking with a colleague and getting sacked for it.\n\n\"Hey, so you've been teaching X for a while now, what do you think of her? She seems like she's got a solid head on her.\"\n\n\"Oh, she's toootally hot garbage. Just sad. I'm gonna fail her so hard her children's careers will be over.\"\n\nAnd then that sarcasm between colleagues that clearly understand each other gets you sacked, because someone took it out of context?", "I don\u2019t know if you \u2018should have\u2019 reacted differently. You acted, and that is a good thing. \u2018Working the streets\u2019 reeks of misogyny and was meant to intimidate. Please don\u2019t waste your time thinking about what you could have or should have done. The person who should have acted differently is being addressed accordingly, thanks to you. \nNTA", "Putting it in writing is a huge mistake", "How is joking that a student will have to be a prostitute to make ends meet, even remotely okay? Putting it in writing is just plain stupid.", "He said she would become a sex worker on the streets. I don't think that is an appropriate joke to make about a student, written or verbal.", "Pretty likely that single remark about you had written down friends", "Yeah, its honestly fine to make cracks like that with people who know you're joking. Putting it in writing changes that.", "OP=NTA\n\neven if he was JOKING he was joking that you would be a homeless prostitute.  THAT is not professional, it is mean and cruel.  And did you really know IN THAT MOMENT he was joking or only after you got a good grade?.", "NTA- I\u2019m in medical school and if I saw a message like that about me, I\u2019d have an anxiety attack. We work so damn hard every day and seeing a message like that is so wrong.", "Good question, I had already seen my grade sheet that he had left out on his desk the second to last day so I knew I was going to pass prior to seeing the message. That\u2019s why I was a little shocked to see such an unprofessional message, there was no purpose at all to send it", "That\u2019s a completely **inappropriate** joke in any profession whether or not it was done through work messaging systems. It\u2019s just wrong!", "I don't think this joke in particular is fine. I mean, look at it. What about a sexist, career threatening crack like this is funny? I'm having a hard time even coming up with a context that would make it even remotely innocuous.\n\nInappropriate jokes in and of themselves aren't always this terrible, and I've said them myself at work.\n\nBut I think the big difference here is that this one was told to a third party, OP wasn't even there to have the ability to enforce any boundaries necessary when jokes like these are told, and the subject matter has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and comes off as genuinely disgusting and threatening. Not to mention the instructor having such a massive amount of control over OP's future in the first place.\n\nThere are people out there who need to learn the hard way that they don't have the good judgment necessary to know where the line in the sand is, and I think this instructor is one of them."]}
