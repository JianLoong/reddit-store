And by the way, that sounded much more like a threat than a joke. I think your marinara flag detector is full on broken.", "NTA - it\u2019s a pretty generally accepted rule of thumb that just you shouldn\u2019t say anything you wouldn\u2019t want leaked if you\u2019re saying it in a professional capacity. This wasn\u2019t banter off the clock, he said it through the messaging system.

He shouldn\u2019t be teaching if he is this unprofessional", "NTA - Things like that are not supposed to be joked about in a professional environment.  Heck I would think less of a person who was joking about it in an unprofessional setting.   This guy probably has done stuff like this more than once too.  So don't feel too bad.", "Nope, NTA. He was unprofessional and out of line with his \"joke\". He caused you stress and anxiety and as you said at the beginning he was rude on and off, so he's the AH here.", "NTA. He was careless and caught. It is someone else's decision how serious it is and the punishment.", "NTA. The dude has a weird sense of humor not to mention definitely does not uphold appropriate professional decorum, and this could absolutely be or become a much bigger issue in the future. He shouldn't be trusted to oversee students if he's going to behave that way in a professional setting. The lewdness and sexual suggestions in that joke were also way over the line and gross.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't \"joke\" about that kind of stuff. Both \"joke\" about failing you and \"joke\" about you being forced into prostitution are things an instructor should NEVER joke around.\n\nFAFO for the now-former instructor.", "NTA, but you need to understand what you can control and what you can't.  You were correct to notify your professor about the instructor's comments.  As a professor, I have learned over the years that students often give much more weight to things said by a teacher.  The instructor's note to the student crossed a line, and there's no way he should be in his position.  He wasn't joking.  But once you told the professor, you had no control over what happened to the instructor.  Plus, you're looking at it from a student's viewpoint.  In my viewpoint, the instructor's behavior was unacceptable and taking him out of that position was the right thing to do.", "NTA.", "NTA, unfortunately he did it to himself. I don\u2019t know if you HAD to report him, I probably would have just let it go bc I didn\u2019t fail. But, you absolutely had every right to do so. He could have said way worse or done worse to other people. It\u2019s his fault in the end.", "NTA - You didn't do anything.  He made a stupid post and deserves what he got.  He has a seriously lack of judgement to think that is an appropriate comment to make at work (joke or not)", "NTA. In fact, I'd say you saved your friend and other students from going through a similar experience with this instructor in the future.", "Absolutely NTA- as someone in this same field, there is unfortunately some issues with control freak / god complex instructors. That message as not only sexist and a hostile work environment issue that is reportable, but it is also a sign that this person should NOT have access to vulnerable patients. You did the right thing to report it, not reporting it could have caused others to be harmed by this person. I know it wasn't easy to report so good on you!", "NTA  The right actions were taken.", "NTA - Truth is truth, and you cannot forgive unprofessional behavior because it was \"a joke\". He was rude, and unprofessional. He needs to be forbidden from teaching.", "NTA. He got what he deserved. That\u2019s extremely inappropriate for not only a workplace, but a teacher.", "nta, i too did clinical rotations for health care along time ago and this is one of my pet peeves. Inappropriate behavior has NO place in the medical profession. I don't care if its one professional commenting \"did you see how cute that patient's sister is\"? or worse.", "He did this to himself and the consequences are correct. This isn\u2019t at all on you OP.", "NTA. He\u2019s basically fucking with student\u2019s reputations before they even graduate. You professor did the right thing an so did you!", "NAH.

Wondering how many students of his in the past 5 years have experienced this and just not said anything", "I was thinking the same thing. Just because he saw it as \"a joke\" does not mean that the person he was saying it to was going to know it was a joke. This could have had long lasting damage to OPs professional reputation. Still could, if that coworker was not brought in and a conversation had to let them know what the instructor said was a malicious lie.\n\nTo say nothing of how many other students he may have done something similar to in the past.
