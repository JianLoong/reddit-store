Heck I would think less of a person who was joking about it in an unprofessional setting.   This guy probably has done stuff like this more than once too.  So don't feel too bad.", "Nope, NTA. He was unprofessional and out of line with his \"joke\". He caused you stress and anxiety and as you said at the beginning he was rude on and off, so he's the AH here.", "NTA. He was careless and caught. It is someone else's decision how serious it is and the punishment.", "NTA. The dude has a weird sense of humor not to mention definitely does not uphold appropriate professional decorum, and this could absolutely be or become a much bigger issue in the future. He shouldn't be trusted to oversee students if he's going to behave that way in a professional setting. The lewdness and sexual suggestions in that joke were also way over the line and gross.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't \"joke\" about that kind of stuff.

You were correct to notify your professor about the instructor's comments.  As a professor, I have learned over the years that students often give much more weight to things said by a teacher.  The instructor's note to the student crossed a line, and there's no way he should be in his position.  He wasn't joking.  But once you told the professor, you had no control over what happened to the instructor.  Plus, you're looking at it from a student's viewpoint.  In my viewpoint, the instructor's behavior was unacceptable and taking him out of that position was the right thing to do.", "NTA.", "NTA, unfortunately he did it to himself. I don\u2019t know if you HAD to report him, I probably would have just let it go bc I didn\u2019t fail. But, you absolutely had every right to do so. He could have said way worse or done worse to other people. It\u2019s his fault in the end.", "NTA - You didn't do anything.  He made a stupid post and deserves what he got.  He has a seriously lack of judgement to think that is an appropriate comment to make at work (joke or not)", "NTA. In fact, I'd say you saved your friend and other students from going through a similar experience with this instructor in the future.", "Absolutely NTA- as someone in this same field, there is unfortunately some issues with control freak / god complex instructors. That message as not only sexist and a hostile work environment issue that is reportable, but it is also a sign that this person should NOT have access to vulnerable patients.

Which is why he\u2019s not teaching them anymore.\n\nNTA", "I know it\u2019s a red flag, it was just a little more conflicting for me as a student as to how to handle it since I haven\u2019t graduated and gotten my license yet. The possibility of problems arising scared me at first. But you\u2019re right, definitely should\u2019ve reacted to the red flag more confidently.", "Now that I think I\u2019ve gotten over just the initial shock of it happening I\u2019m thinking this viewpoint more and more. No one else needed to go there, he\u2019s also being reprimanded by his workplace (not sure what that\u2019s going to consist of). Wondering how many students of his in the past 5 years have experienced this and just not said anything", "I was thinking the same thing. Just because he saw it as \"a joke\" does not mean that the person he was saying it to was going to know it was a joke. This could have had long lasting damage to OPs professional reputation. Still could, if that coworker was not brought in and a conversation had to let them know what the instructor said was a malicious lie.\n\nTo say nothing of how many other students he may have done something similar to in the past. Or how many he might have in the future, if he hadn't been reported.", "Now that I\u2019ve gotten over the initial shock, I\u2019m happy that he isn\u2019t going to get students anymore.

Yeah, no. This dude was behaving like an ass. To instruct newcomers you need to act like an adult, first.", "Nope NTA, what an idiot. The prostitute comment is really concerning. This guy\u2019s students\u2019 safety take priority over his shit \u201cjokes\u201d.\n\nNever feel bad about reporting sexual comments like this. I\u2019m glad the professor had your back, she was rightfully pissed.", "NTA, this type of comment is sexual harassment.  To say a student will work the streets because he fails them.  This shows that he feels he has power over the intern.  His being rude on and off most likely was a test to see if you would crack and be fearful of failing.  Think about what might have happened if you did not remain professional when he was rude.  Think about other students that might not have the same strength you showed to him.  You saved a lot of students a lot of harm.", "NTA.  His comments were unprofessional and inappropriate and it needed to be reported.  There should be zero tolerance for that type of behavior.  And the changes are not your fault.", "It wasn't even said to her, how would it be a threat?? Just imagine joking with a colleague and getting sacked for it.\n\n\"Hey, so you've been teaching X for a while now, what do you think of her? She seems like she's got a solid head on her.\"\n\n\"Oh, she's toootally hot garbage. Just sad. I'm gonna fail her so hard her children's careers will be over.\"\n\nAnd then that sarcasm between colleagues that clearly understand each other gets you sacked, because someone took it out of context?", "I don\u2019t know if you \u2018should have\u2019 reacted differently. You acted, and that is a good thing. \u2018Working the streets\u2019 reeks of misogyny and was meant to intimidate. Please don\u2019t waste your time thinking about what you could have or should have done. The person who should have acted differently is being addressed accordingly, thanks to you. \nNTA", "Putting it in writing is a huge mistake", "How is joking that a student will have to be a prostitute to make ends meet, even remotely okay? Putting it in writing is just plain stupid.", "He said she would become a sex worker on the streets. I don't think that is an appropriate joke to make about a student, written or verbal.", "Pretty likely that single remark about you had written down friends", "Yeah, its honestly fine to make cracks like that with people who know you're joking. Putting it in writing changes that.", "OP=NTA\n\neven if he was JOKING he was joking that you would be a homeless prostitute.  THAT is not professional, it is mean and cruel.  And did you really know IN THAT MOMENT he was joking or only after you got a good grade?.", "NTA- I\u2019m in medical school and if I saw a message like that about me, I\u2019d have an anxiety attack. We work so damn hard every day and seeing a message like that is so wrong.", "Good question, I had already seen my grade sheet that he had left out on his desk the second to last day so I knew I was going to pass prior to seeing the message. That\u2019s why I was a little shocked to see such an unprofessional message, there was no purpose at all to send it", "That\u2019s a completely **inappropriate** joke in any profession whether or not it was done through work messaging systems. It\u2019s just wrong!", "I don't think this joke in particular is fine. I mean, look at it. What about a sexist, career threatening crack like this is funny? I'm having a hard time even coming up with a context that would make it even remotely innocuous.\n\nInappropriate jokes in and of themselves aren't always this terrible, and I've said them myself at work.\n\nBut I think the big difference here is that this one was told to a third party, OP wasn't even there to have the ability to enforce any boundaries necessary when jokes like these are told, and the subject matter has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and comes off as genuinely disgusting and threatening. Not to mention the instructor having such a massive amount of control over OP's future in the first place.\n\nThere are people out there who need to learn the hard way that they don't have the good judgment necessary to know where the line in the sand is, and I think this instructor is one of them.", "NTA and good for you for reporting this jerk. You\u2019ve probably saved a lot of future trainees a lot of pain.", "NTA.  You did not create this situation.  He did.  What he did was highly inappropriate.  If his boss knew about it and didn't address it, his boss should also be disciplined.  This is not the first time he's done this but, thanks to you speaking up, it sounds like it will be the last time he does this something like this.", "NTA. Fuck that guy. He caused his own misery by being an unprofessional dick bag.", "NTA\n\nJust because something is a joke doesn't make it acceptable. \n\nYou were right to pass this to your professor and let them, with their experience, make a decision on how to best deal with it.", "All you did was inform your professor. They're the one who chose how to handle it. It's not your fault they were strict. He actually did the thing he was reprimanded for.", "Putting it in your work chat is stupid and you deserve to lose your job for being that dumb.", "You can\u2019t be serious. You are also rewriting what was actually said to make it less offensive.", "The professor wasn't strict imo, just responsible. I agree absolutely, OP just informed the professor and the professor handled it.", ">What about a sexist, career threatening crack like this is funny?\n\nIts sarcasm. Healthcare workers tend to have a warped sense of humor anyway (cause you have to), and its not unusual to sarcastically say someone is awful when its known that they're good.\n\nSource: Healthcare worker. You *have* to be weird to do this.", "I just don't think there's a place for a joke like this when the subject of the joke is not present to defend themselves or crack back. It's one thing to vent, but this is pretty egregious, stressful work environment or not. After a certain point, you have to start worrying about cultivating toxicity with your workers/students, and I think the swift punishment of the instructor perfectly highlights that.\n\nAgain, I don't think all inappropriate jokes are necessarily terrible, and they can be very funny and cathartic. It just heavily relies on using good judgment to know how far you can push, and I don't think this instructor had that even if we give him the benefit of the doubt, which I'm hesitant to do here.\n\nEDIT: I think what it really boils down to for me is that if you're gonna have the balls to make a joke about a person's gender, race, sexuality, religion, etc, then you should have the balls to say it to that person's face. It allows the opportunity for the person to process the context and determine if they want to consent to being part of jokes like this. After all, a joke is only funny if everyone is laughing.", "NTA: I\u2019m a nurse and I\u2019ve also taught nursing students in a clinical rotation. That instructor does not belong working with students. Especially how you describe his demeanor. Clinical instructors should be lifting up student nurses, not tearing them down. I\u2019m glad your professor believed you.", "Takes courage to be the first one to raise their head above the parapet. Bravo.\n\nWhat is absolutely and irrefutably certain is that you are not the first student to be treated so poorly.\n\nThere is no shame in being responsible for someone no longer having the right to teach future students. However, your caution given that you are not yet qualified is understandable.\n\nYou are NTA and I guarantee there are many former, and current, students who are pleased that you had the courage to do what you did.", "All the times I\u2019ve trained ppl and gave feedbacks I never once threatened someone in failing or firing ppl. That is a no go and shud be defined a hostile work place if he had continued. Instructors are there to guide and help for future ppl. If they\u2019re unable to do that then why are they teaching? \n\nThe career path you\u2019ve chosen shouldn\u2019t be that way and should be taken seriously since lives are at stake would be different if it was retail but even then it shouldn\u2019t be joked till much much later. (Used to work a coworker that would say fire me please!! I\u2019d always go nah lol I shud mention it dealt with merchandise/replenishment lol)", "Ew why are you defending him?", "Did you genuinely miss the part where he said she was going to become a prostitute?", "This. I work in an academic hospital; this nonsense is far too common because students are often too scared and dependent to speak up about it. You end up in situations where everyone but the administration knows what\u2019s happening and it just keeps going and going. So much credit to you for speaking up, and your prof for taking action!", "Please tell me what is funny and humourous about saying you're going to make someone homeless and work on the street (aka sex work)? I have a pretty warped sense of humour but there is literally nothing funny about being homeless and working the street. That is a miserable existence and not something to \"joke\" about making someone else."]}
