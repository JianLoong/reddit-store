She's annoyed when I say nobody got back to me. She's annoyed when I tell her I'm not moving on in the interview process. Always annoyed.\n\nLast week, I had 4 phone/intro interviews, and by Friday I had 4 no's. She comes home, I tell her the bad news, but try to let her know that I feel like soon, one of these will hit.\n\nShe starts yelling at me that clearly I'm messing up in these interviews and clearly I'm not doing all I can. It was hurtful. I'd already had 4 rejections from interviews I felt good about and now I'm getting yelled at.\n\nShe said she was growing impatient with me. I told her that by the looks of her, her waistline is growing too.\n\nIt's a topic she doesn't like discussing but over the past year, she's become overweight. Whether or not that's tied to job stress or this recent stress of my job situation, I don't know for her, I just know her weight's skyrocketed over the past year.\n\nShe said that what I said was uncalled for. I told her that her yelling was uncalled for. She told me to keep up my dead end job search. I told her to keep up the cookie binges.\n\nI could see her being mad if I was just sitting at home all day with my thumb up my nose not trying, but, I'm putting out applications for hours, leaving people messages trying to get interviews.

I can understand her frustration. It can make people mad when things arnt working. The anger is just misdirected. Communication is key in a relationship. You need to explain that this anger is misdirected and explain something you could try differently to improve your situation. Why would you just jump to pointing out her weight.

She was wrong for yelling at you but also have a partner you share bills with who isn\u2019t working for months is stressful. Ugh the shallowness of this whole thing is baffling.", "YTA, wow. You reacted badly there. I get you were already down and she shouldn\u2019t have yelled but you used a very sensitive topic to her to lash out.

I get job hunting suck, but you have to understand that you not having a job puts stress on BOTH of you. You not having a job also puts her at financial risk, because what happens when your savings runs out and you still don\u2019t have a job? The weight comment was a low blow, and very immature. You retaliated because your ego was hurt, and instead of recognizing that this situation sucks for everyone, you decided to comment on her appearance.", "The sole reason you said it was to hurt her.  YTA.  She's an asshole too, because job hunting is a bear and it always takes longer than anyone would like.  I've only been job hunting once in my adult life and it was horrible.  It took a good 5 months - and I had the benefit of a pension at that point.  I wasn't going to starve, but It's the worst feeling ever.  I can see why you'd want to make her feel horrible about herself after having suffered her attacks.\n\nShe thinks you're enjoying this job hunting?  To hell with her.  This is when you find out whether or not someone is going to make a situation better or worse.  You have your answer with this one.  She's happy to make the situation worse.\n\nYou shouldn't have said that about her weight, but I can't say that I blame you for wanting to lash back.\n\nI tell my children that the ONE thing to look for in a relationship is whether they are there to make a situation better or worse.

For fucks sake it\u2019s been 3 months and you\u2019ve got nothing. At least working 3 days/15 hours at a throw away job will keep some money coming in and lower her stress levels. Then on your days/hours off look for a job that\u2019s more suitable. It\u2019s insane to me that you could be out of work for 3 months with no back up plans.\n\nEdit: YTA. Definitively YTA.

Obviously I get the feeling of being shouted at while trying your best, but bringing her weight into discussion was uncalled for.

Emotions were probably high and you probably weren\u2019t thinking rationally but if something like that happens again, try explaining to her calmly that you\u2019re doing everything you can and that it hurts you to not get support from your partner, instead of just snapping back.", "ESH, you don\u2019t seem to get this puts extra pressure on her. Also, how is bringing up something irrelevant going to help? Not only is it mean it actually distracts from your point. You\u2019re cruel to each other", "ESH. Your partner is being the opposite of supportive. You really didn't have to go there with her weight, you know it's a low blow & will hit her self esteem yet instead of acknowledging that you said something horrible just to hurt her in an argument & apologising for it you're online asking strangers if it's OK to double down. If you want your relationship to end then by all means continue but in reality you need to have a calm discussion about your relationship, it sounds like there's resentment on both sides.", "YTA. I hope she kicks you out and realizes what dead weight you are. I bet you\u2019re more overweight that she is too and have the never with this trash.", "Honestly, it would be in her best interest to leave you. A healthy relationship has no room for insulting your partner because you don't like what they have to say or how they say it. She may have been hitting low, but you hit much, much lower. You clearly don't respect her at all, and you have an extremely shallow and critical attitude toward her body.", "Lol YTA. How was that comment even relevant to what you\u2019ll were talking about. It\u2019s not her fault that you aren\u2019t doing well in interviews.", "YTA. Find someone else to mooch off.", "YTA, dude you are a loser your girlfriend will hopefully dump you and find a guy that can appreciate her, not poke fun at her weight because little loser boy is upset that she is mad at him for being a jobless bum.", "OF COURSE YOU ARE THE ASSHOLE!!!!!! \nAnd I hope she sees what a nasty person you are and leaves you! \n\nThere are plenty of jobs, you are just not willing to do them.

Maybe cool off and talk properly. It's tough getting those rejections and you were in a vulnerable place but maybe she's got a point on those interview skills, even if she put it badly. It might be worth having her or a friend doing some practice interviews with you just to see if there is anything you need to hone up on.", "YTA, if the only insult you can throw back at her is about her weight, then you truly are a loser. \n\nNo wonder she's getting annoyed with you.", "YTA for bringing up her weight. It had nothing to do with the discussion and just a cheap,petty jab at your GF.

Really seems like you don't.", "ESH, you shouldn\u2019t have said what you said about her weight. \n\nRegardless of what you are and aren\u2019t doing to get a job, she should not be yelling at you like a child.", "YTA. She's reasonably frustrated and you responded with a personal attack that has NOTHING to do with the situation at hand. You WAY overstepped. Frankly if I were her I'd end the relationship--no self respecting person should stay who speaks to their partner like you spoke to her.", "YTA. Just have a fucking conversation with her dude. \n\nSo you\u2019re paying your half of the rent with your savings. What about every other expense you have? Is she picking up the slack? I notice you only mention the rent. \n\nIf she\u2019s covering you when you\u2019re unemployed then it\u2019s fair that she\u2019s as frustrated as you are. This is something you need to be able to talk about. \n\nBody shaming her is a dick move.", "Yeah she\u2019s overweight but at least she has a job and isn\u2019t relying on someone else to take care of her.", "Info: what about your other bills? Food? Is she paying for everything else? \n\nBecause if so, it\u2019s been three months. Look, when you\u2019re unemployed and unlucky with interviews, maybe you need to pick up a job that you\u2019re overqualified for just to pay the bills. I\u2019ve done that several times and continued job hunting for better positions in my spare time. \n\nI can understand if she\u2019s getting frustrated if this puts financial strain on her too, and maybe she\u2019s sticking with a stressful job that she\u2019d rather not because she\u2019s the only safety net now? \n\nOf course she shouldn\u2019t yell at you - but you should equally be able to have an adult conversation about it. \n\nBringing up her weight like that and then doubling down on it in the comments here - as if it\u2019s even remotely comparable with the problem of you being unemployed! - is such a shitty move I\u2019m amazed she hasn\u2019t left you. \n\nIs that the plan? To erode her self esteem so much that she won\u2019t leave you? Find a better way of handling your obvious feelings of inadequacy. \n\nYTA.", "YTA and your responses confirm it.

Like a little kid.", "YTA\n\nI understand that you are frustrated with your job search and her impatience about it but your reaction to attack your girlfriend for her weight was uncalled for.  \n\nBoth of you need to learn empathy and compassion.", "You guys fight dirty. You're not arguing with the intention of reaching some solution or compromise or idea...you're just insulting each other. Do you still love each other or are you just co-existing?\n\nYou're still paying your way so your unemployment hasn't cost her anything extra. You're actively looking and applying - any niche job will take longer to land. It's not like you've been unemployed for years - 3 months is pretty standard if you're not in some super high demand industry that's struggling for employees.", "Both of y\u2019all suck.", "this doesn't sound healthy at all, if she can't support you when you're having a tough time perhaps you'd be happier without her, lashing out about her weight isn't going to help the issue.", "dude yta. why is her weight relevant to you not being able to get a job. attacking her just because you\u2019re taking an L is an asshole move. maybe she shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you, you might be trying your best, but by belittling her about an unrelated subject, tearing her down to your level for no reason just because you feel bad is a pure ah move and i hope apologise. ultimately your actions stop me from pitying you, because you\u2019ve made yourself the bad guy.", "jesus christ yta.", "You really should work on your communication skills, both of you, if this relationship should last.

Is there a friend you could try renting from?", "ESH. she should've been more considerate of your feelings. rather than beating you down when you got rejected, she should've comforted you. but the weight joke on your end was a low blow, you shouldn't have said it.

Other household expenses? If all of that is on her I can understand her growing frustration. He, on the other hand, mentioned her supposed weight gain with sole purpose of hurting her. And that, my friend, is a major AH  move.", "this. I\u2019d say they\u2019re both assholes, since she was yelling at him nonstop for only 3 months of unemployment.

I've got plan Bs in mind", "Since April. It's the first line. So at most he's been unemployed 3 monthish", "Have you ever looked for a job before? Cause that's kinda how it works. Why does she get to berate him for something out of his control. He's not sitting on ass, he's actively looking. He's covering his half of the bills, and can do so for a few more months. He was absolutely wrong for what he said to her, but why is this comment section excusing and downplaying her behavior? It's ESH in my opinion.", "For me it's often the stay at home snacking, so if they are going out less due to finances that would be my guess tbh.", "I'm frustrated too", "So the solution is to yell at him?  Again - will someone help you make your problem better, or will they make it worse?  If they're making the problem worse, why keep them around?", "you have a point, but let\u2019s just *assume* that she started yelling.

He can never take back those words, and even if he gets 10 jobs, she will never be able to forget his body shaming. \n\nIf tables were turned, and he had yelled at her for not trying hard enough to find a job & her response was to insult his tiny, ineffectual penis, you'd probably think she was an asshole!!", "You mean a couple more months?", "Oh my bad.\n\nWell, for right now I recommend just talking with her. Express how she hurt you and why it made you upset. Express how your sorry that you hurt her, you were just frustrated. You were both frustrated. That is ok. What matters is trying to mend your relationship. I hope it goes well.", "I Literally had 3 job offers last month after interviews that were all minimum wage jobs, but that\u2019s my point. He\u2019s looking for jobs specifically in his field, he is not branching out at all. At this point he\u2019s being selfish, if he worked one of those jobs in the meantime she would know he\u2019s actually trying but him simply looking for one specific type of job will obviously take a while. If he ended up working at a crappy minimum wage job for a year bc of not being able to find work, at least he wouldn\u2019t have used his entire savings and then be getting that kind of job anyways. That\u2019s just the logical thing to do imo, he should be applying for all kinds of jobs not just one specific job.", "You\u2019re both the AH and it sounds like it\u2019s getting toxic. \n\nI don\u2019t agree with her behaviour at all but you\u2019re the bigger AH because commenting on someone\u2019s body is just horrible and you should never do that to someone you\u2019re supposed to love so please do better. \n\nYour situation sounds very stressful and I hope you get a job soon.", "If you're frustrated about your job search, that's on you to deal with your own emotions without acting like an immature baby and lashing out at people.\n\nIf you're frustrated about her weight gain, you have two choices - decide that your frustration over her weight gain is enough to end the relationship, or **STFU and never mention it again because it's none of your bloody business.**", "he needs to dump her and move on, she's not the kind of partner you want to spend your life with, the power dynamic has shifted and she's shown him who she is when the chips are down", "I hope you like your new knee", "But is he out of savings now? No. Is she pulling his weight now? No. So why does she get to berate him?", "I would still think that they both suck, which is why I don't understand calling only him the asshole. One being an asshole doesn't negate the other being an asshole as well. Doesn't matter what dangling bits one has, an asshole is an asshole. Two things can be right at the same time. I don't understand why this is controversial lol.", "yeah", "thanks", "If I had spent years and thousands for a degree, I'd probably try to stay in my same field. Comparing finding a fast food job to finding a corporate job is disingenuous. It's not remotely similar.", "Whereas he is a real catch, being an immature jerk, who purposely hurts their partner and refuses to admit it was wrong. Sure.", "Downvoted for being reasonable. This sub is ridiculous at times.", "Had he called her out on her being an unsupportive jerk & left it at that, everyone would have been on his side.\n\n\n It's the fact that he decided to change the subject completely, and purposefully be cruel & hurtful & tell her she's fat & to lay off the cookies. I don't understand why this is confusing lol", "If you're getting so many no's maybe marketing isn't for you", "He\u2019s 27, he\u2019s still young. No one is saying don\u2019t keep looking for the job you want, of course he should. But the thing is, he\u2019s had several interviews over the course of 3 months. Each interviewer has turned him down. Obviously there\u2019s a reason for this, whether it be bc they\u2019re just not interested in him, they find someone better, whatever the case may be *he is not getting hired* it\u2019s very unlikely he\u2019s got enough money to maintain unemployment while using his savings. He will run out, she will be the one pulling his weight. I wouldn\u2019t doubt that she is saving money in preparation for this, he is stressing her out. Even had he not called her fat, I wouldn\u2019t say she\u2019s wrong to be frustrated at him. He\u2019s not getting hired, he has told her several times now that he\u2019s denied a job. After being denied 6 times if I were in his shoes I would\u2019ve started looking at other entry level jobs or like I said minimum wage jobs. It\u2019s not a forever Job, it\u2019s a \u201cso i don\u2019t waste all of my savings bc I\u2019m not bringing any income in\u201d job. Even if he\u2019s still using his savings, at least he\u2019s not using every dime of savings without any income. He could even door dash or do instacart, but damn do something.", "you can't see the wood for the trees, I think a lot of the yta are based on sexism, if the shoe were on the other foot the reaction would be entirely different. he made a hurtful comment after clearly a lot of build up, your getting mad because the abused person is lashing out, the lashing out part is mostly irrelevant and focusing on that isn't addressing the core issue", "Oh I know, I expected it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. They feel like calling her fat erases what she did. There is no accountability for women in this sub. They twist and turn and tie themselves into knots to justify her behavior when to any rational person, ESH.", "The bias is really coming through with this one lol. Remember this sub telling a guy he should pay off his gfs student loans because \"shEs YoUr gIRLfRienD\" but theyre justifying a woman treating her bf like shit over the mere *prospect* of potentianlly having to help him financially. You can not make this shit up.", "Ah so because he called her fat, it completely excuses what she did.", "If you can't sell yourself how you gonna sell anyone else anything?", "How do you know how much money he has saved? You don't. It's baseless speculation to excuse this woman's poor behavior. Smh they were both wrong for different reasons, but still BOTH of them were wrong. Why is that so hard to say?", "You can't. They are both clearly assholes, but accountability for women is non-existent in this sub \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Either comprehension is not your strong suit or you're purposefully being obtuse. Either way, you do you \u270c\ufe0f", "It\u2019s not hard to say, I just don\u2019t agree. Agree to disagree bc neither of us are gonna change our perspective on the situation lol", "Just so we're clear, she gets a full on pass, and did absolutely nothing wrong?"]}
