I also start bringing up embarrassing things about the person who brought it up.

That sounds really horrible. Try the report system", "Personally I would just ask why all of these people want to see a distressed child in panties doing involuntary splits. I\u2019d make everyone real uncomfortable and I would absolute make it clear I\u2019m implying they have gross intentions and refuse to frame it any other way. Every time. Your aunt brings it up? Ask her why she likes looking at pictures of little girls in panties. Mom and dad bring it out to laugh? Ask them if they keep other creepy images of children. Ask if there\u2019s something you should know about them or be worried about with other children. If they share it on Facebook, comment that whoever posted is sick and creepy and then report it. Every time. Be loud in public spaces when they bring it up. \u201cWhy are you showing a picture of a little girl in her panties?! What\u2019s wrong with you?!\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve been polite. Now be the biggest fucking asshole ever. And yeah, I know they probably aren\u2019t all perverts.

Has nothing of interest occurred in your family since you were stuck in the swing? Perhaps you could upload pictures they don\u2019t like and offer a trade. \n\nHow old are you now?

What on earth is this reaction when a little kid is in distress ? Taking photos ? \n\nIt is perfectly normal you react that way, as you have asked for it to be taken off more than once", "NTA, how private is their Facebook? Not only is that embarrassing for you, they shouldn\u2019t have taken the photos in general etc like everyone else is saying, but there are child predators on the internet. What if the wrong person sees it? That\u2019s even worse.", "NTA. I've been asking my kids for their permission to post their pictures on the internet for YEARS. It's their digital identity, they deserve to have veto power.  If they say no... the picture doesn't get posted. Period. They appreciate the respect!

Which I hope you follow up with \u201cwhy is this funny?\u201d \n  Endless why, make it uncomfortable AF for everyone why a crying child x-number of decades ago with their underwear showing isn\u2019t funny.

It's a picture of you and you do not consent to that picture being on social media. They should take it down if they have any respect for you. Family is a choice, and they're choosing otherwise.

Frankly, I would unfriend them on Facebook and stew in annoyance (I probably also wouldn't talk to them for a while)", "NTA, and what kind of people take pictures instead of helping a crying child in distress, and then go on to further traumatize the child by showing everyone they can find? That picture doesn't speak very highly of your parents. You might want to say something along the lines of, \"Yeah, isn't it great? My parents decided to take a picture instead of helping their distressed child\" the next time they show it to someone, and before you start ignoring your parents.
