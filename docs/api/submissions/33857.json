That sounds really horrible. Try the report system", "Personally I would just ask why all of these people want to see a distressed child in panties doing involuntary splits. I\u2019d make everyone real uncomfortable and I would absolute make it clear I\u2019m implying they have gross intentions and refuse to frame it any other way. Every time. Your aunt brings it up? Ask her why she likes looking at pictures of little girls in panties. Mom and dad bring it out to laugh? Ask them if they keep other creepy images of children. Ask if there\u2019s something you should know about them or be worried about with other children. If they share it on Facebook, comment that whoever posted is sick and creepy and then report it. Every time. Be loud in public spaces when they bring it up. \u201cWhy are you showing a picture of a little girl in her panties?! What\u2019s wrong with you?!\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve been polite.

Taking photos ? \n\nIt is perfectly normal you react that way, as you have asked for it to be taken off more than once", "NTA, how private is their Facebook?

What if the wrong person sees it? That\u2019s even worse.", "NTA. I've been asking my kids for their permission to post their pictures on the internet for YEARS. It's their digital identity, they deserve to have veto power.  If they say no... the picture doesn't get posted. Period. They appreciate the respect!

It's a picture of you and you do not consent to that picture being on social media. They should take it down if they have any respect for you. Family is a choice, and they're choosing otherwise. If they won't take the pictures down, start reporting the pics to Facebook as a picture of you that you consider to be CSAM and demand that Facebook take it down.", "NTA - it's incredibly rude to post pictures of someone on Facebook that they specifically requested you not post and/or take down. Frankly, I would unfriend them on Facebook and stew in annoyance (I probably also wouldn't talk to them for a while)", "NTA, and what kind of people take pictures instead of helping a crying child in distress, and then go on to further traumatize the child by showing everyone they can find? That picture doesn't speak very highly of your parents. You might want to say something along the lines of, \"Yeah, isn't it great? My parents decided to take a picture instead of helping their distressed child\" the next time they show it to someone, and before you start ignoring your parents.

Report the image and the account.\nThen go NC with your family.\n\nThe reason these images get taken down isn't cos you're embarrassed it's because your image can and maybe has been used in an appalling way.

Doesn't Facebook have a way to report this shit?", "NTA\n\nSeriously this is abusive.\n\nYou were in distress so they took a photo and placed it on Facebook?! \n\nAlso, your underwear was showing... a child is NOT some object.  An individual that deserves respect. Also, would this fall under child protection laws in some areas?\n\nI am sorry but this is not appropriate behaviour.  Can you report the photo?  Facebook must take reports of minors seriously.", "NTA!! This is creepy and the fact that they pull it up frequently shows that they think it\u2019s acceptable to frequently look at a child spread out and helpless.", "NTA", "on one hand, i can see how your parents would see this picture as a precious memory of your childhood. but if they ignore your request even after you have clearly stated your discomfort with their sharing the picture, then that's plain selfishness on their part. this is a picture where you are the only subject so by sharing it, you are the only one being laughed that. if they can't empathize with their child, they are not being very good parents. same reasoning goes for any family member who continues to get a laugh at your expense. \n\nNTA", "Take an embarrassing photo of them and post it as revenge.", "NTA. I can't believe that anyone would think that that is okay.", "NTA. In fact, you could afford to be more of an asshole without being on their level.

This is fucking weird and creepy. Your family has no concept of consent.", "NTA.  Apparently your parents think you don't have any feelings.  That is a cruel thing they are doing, and I'm sure if you report it to Facebook they will take it down.", "Love this! Do this!! \n\nThey like to laugh at a little child's misery. The child  in that picture, at that moment, is extremely scared and in pain. These sociopathic  adults who were supposed to protect that child take this moment as a laughing opportunity and they do so repeatedly many times in the future; despite the child telling them that they didn't find this funny. That's highly unempathetic, immature and just crappy of them to do that. Good job on losing a part of that child's trust forever! \n\nA joke is only a joke if everyone in the situation finds it funny. You clearly don't.

OP asked them to not share it because it bothers them, and their feelings--which are valid and even understandable to anyone with basic empathy and reasoning skills--are being cruelly brushed aside.

It doesn't look good. :(", ">OP asked them to not share it because it bothers them\n\nIt's a funny picture. Chill everyone. Families share those pics and vids with each other all the time. Ussually it's a vid of someone getting hit in the balls, or the kids crying because they saw the Grinch.", "So you've never laughed at someone getting hit in the balls?", "I agree. Hopefully it will turn from a society seeking their 15 minutes of fame via a post going viral back to prosecuting evidence of neglect.", "If it was a picture of me at five years old and I am now nearly 40 I would probably laugh at it.

How would you feel?", "That would be different since they are forcing the situation. \n\nHere a kid got stuck in a funny situation due to no one's fault .

It's not any serious violation of anything\n\nWhy is everyone on this app so autistic?", "Something about someone being totally helpless with their legs spread apart while they're crying just ruins any chance of amusement for me. I guess I just feel kind of uncomfortable when I see people getting their privacy and bodily autonomy violated like that. Must just be because I'm weird.", "Why is it *more* acceptable that this is happening to a child rather than an adult? It's a non consensual picture of someone's underwear.", "Because there is nothing sexual about children in their underwear! No one normal would *ever* make that connection!\n\nFrankly, it's sick that you even think there is...\n\nYou need to have a good, hard look in the mirror and ask yourself why you are sexualising children!", "Do you think that children don't have the concept of private parts? It's not a matter of sexuality, it's a matter of privacy.", "I cannot be bothered talking to someone so divorced from reality\n\nHappy new year and all the best"]}
