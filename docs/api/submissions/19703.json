With that many people invited, you really really don't want children there in case anything happens. The people complaining always have the option to just...not go.", "NTA. Sounds like your reasonably thought through the considerations. What tends to happen at things like this is there will likely be at least 1 parent who lets others watch their kids while they have a good time which means others can\u2019t.", "NTA. Backyard pools are so dangerous for kids, especially at parties where every adult thinks one of the many other adults is watching the kids but no one really is. \n\nPlus you can just have adults only parties.

But your also is also not childproofed but because you have 4 - 8 months old babies, it\u2019s safe to assume that the floor is tidy and since your babies aren\u2019t very mobile, they won\u2019t get that far. You also pointed out the hazard of a golf course and the concern of someone getting hit by a golf ball.
