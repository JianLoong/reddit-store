At first, luna was going to be hers. But her mother then told her she can\u2019t have her. So Luna ended up staying at my apartment full time while we were together. And I agreed to be the one she lives with. She\u2019s attached to me at this point. \n\nWe kind of had an unspoken agreement that when she gets her own place, or a place together of our own, she can have the cat. But things changed. \n\nMy ex did buy the cat, the cat tree, food, toys, and most things. And we\u2019d split the cost of food and litter. But we didn\u2019t get her any shots or chips so there\u2019s no proof in any records of my name either. When I\u2019d go on vacation, even after we broke up, she would come over to take care of her. I would pay for her food and things. It wasn\u2019t just her. \n\nWhen the lease ended, I lost my job and had to move back home with my Mom. There is a converted shed in the yard that\u2019s the size of a bedroom. It\u2019s heated and perfectly fine. I just have to walk inside to use the bathroom. So Luna was living there with me. But she went to tell me how \u201ccleaning the litter box once a week is not good\u201d and would complain and clean it for me. \n\nFast forward three years, we broke up.\n\n Then a few months later, she told me she\u2019s moving into her own apartment, and asked to take Luna. I said no. \n\nShe then went on to tell me \u201cI have a whole apartment and Luna is inside a shed by herself all day while you are out partying\u201d \n\nI am living with my new girlfriend now at her place with two other cats, and Luna has made herself home here. It\u2019s not fair to rip her out of a home, and she\u2019s so comfortable with me. My girlfriend agrees that it\u2019s mostly my car. \n\nAITA for not giving her the cat?

You suck for forcing your cat cat to poop and pee in really nasty conditions by not cleaning the box every single day, you got to take the poop out at a minimum and there should always be one extra box per cat, so she needed two boxes instead of just one. Your ex was terrible for getting a cat when she didn\u2019t have the living situation sorted.\n\nYou go and apologize to Luna right now for not taking her to get the shots she needs to keep from getting deadly diseases you can give her from simple hand transfer, take her to the vet and give her lots of treats for the experience, and promise her that you will clean her and any of her cat buddies litter boxes twice a day for the rest of their lives, and that there will always be one more box than the number of cat in the household for the rest of their lives.\n\nAnd ownership of Luna will be in the new girlfriend\u2019s name, because you are not going to separate her from her feline buddies ever.

It wouldn't be fair on Luna to go from her seeing you every day to never for no real good reason that isn't in her best interest.\n\nI'd say that as long as you compensate her financially for the cat then you're not an asshole so you should consider doing that.\n\n>But we didn\u2019t get her any shots or chips\n\nYou should definitely get this done though.", "NTA. You & your ex got Luna together, but she dumped her on you because her mom didn't want the cat around her. The ex may have financially contributed, but you've been Luna's primary care giver for years. She's attached to you; you are her human, her cat Dad. Luna sounds comfortable in your home with your girlfriend & her cats. Uprooting a cat who's attached to you is just cruel, especially if she gets dumped again. Get the proper paperwork naming you as her owner, get her updated on shots, & get her microchipped to prevent cat theft by your ex.
