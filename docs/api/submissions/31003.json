They weren\u2019t very close those last few years - Kate was very involved in her sorority, very peppy, had a great social life, and her sister Megan was very introverted, lived with their parents, and more depressed. But growing up we were all good friends, though I didn\u2019t see Megan as much since she didn\u2019t go to our college or stay in that city after college. \n\nWhen Megan died, Kate took one day with her family then wanted to go out the next night. From then on, it was as though Megan never existed. Kate posted cute instagram photos with sassy captions four days later. She showed up to events laughing, wanted to go shopping, etc. I was honestly a little down because Megan was there for my whole childhood, but I respected that everyone grieves differently and it\u2019s really not about me.\n\nLast night was the anniversary of Megan\u2019s death. We were at a winery with our friend group and Kate\u2019s new boyfriend. At one point, I mentioned to her that I knew its a big day and was always here for her (trying to be discreet but still supportive). She rolled her eyes and told me to stop bringing the vibe down. I told her I was just trying to be supportive about Megan. Her boyfriend (she\u2019s been dating for about 5 months) must have been behind me and asked who Megan is. Kate got all huffy and said \u201cshe\u2019s my dead sister, but we weren\u2019t close at all so we don\u2019t need to talk about it.\u201d The whole thing felt kind of weird like she just wanted to go back to talking about the Golden Bachelor because she literally didn\u2019t care.\n\nI guess her boyfriend was upset she never mentioned it because today she texted me and said \u201cthanks a lot for starting problems with Sean. Can you just be less fucking morbid.\u201d\n\nNow I\u2019m torn. On the one hand, I feel like she might not ever have been grieving and just literally doesn\u2019t care. She does jump through friends and relationships quickly, but we\u2019ve always managed to stay close. And I just can\u2019t imagine her not actually caring that her sister is dead? On the other hand, I feel kind of bad for saying anything. I think I might have read the cues very wrong and should have followed her lead and not brought it up.

If she wants to handle it by moving forward and not acknowledging she had a living sister at one point, she can do that.\n\nBut you\u2019re not in the wrong for trying to discreetly check on her during (what most people would consider) a difficult time", "You literally just tried to offer her generic support in the most benign way possible. The problems she's having now are between her and her boyfriend, and are honestly probably because of the nonchalant and heartless way she explained the situation to him. People grieve in different ways, but what you've posted here doesn't paint her in a positive light. Like, I'm not close with my sister at all because we fought a lot as kids and we're very different people now and don't even live in the same country anymore, but I'd still be sad if she died.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I don\u2019t want to make judgments about Kate or her relationship with her sister, but that\u2019s super bizarre. I maybe wouldn\u2019t have brought it up, but you certainly didn\u2019t deserve to be yelled at for this.", "NTA. I think you were just trying to be kind, but she was clear it was unwelcome. I don't understand her either, but as you said it's not about you.", "Gentle ESH.  You for bringing this up in a group wine tasting. Your intentions were good but execution was bad.  How were you expecting this to go, in this setting, with other people listening?\n\nHer for her passive aggressive text. \n\nGrief is complicated. I am dealing with my own grief at the moment and sometimes it feels so vast that I think if I acknowledge it I'll drown.  I find it difficult in the moment when friends take a beat to tell me they love me and are here for me, but I appreciate their support on a deeper level.  It took my friend several years to be able to talk about her mother's death; she later told me she appreciated just knowing that I was there for her. \n\nMy advice to you would be to apologize for bringing it up at the wrong moment and say that you just wanted to ensure she knew that you care about her and are there for her if she ever needs it.", "NAH, you tried to be discreet, and failed, but made a good-faith attempt. Although your gesture was not well received and she was unkind to you, it isn't really about you, and she is entitled to process how she needs to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add: the part about her boyfriend is strange for sure, but doesn't make her an asshole. Just a confused grieving 20-something.", "It sounds like you're grieving more for Megan than her sister is. If you were all friends that's understandable. And being so young, it does strike some people really hard because they haven't really experienced the death of someone you were close to. You may have had good intentions, as my dad used to say that's what the road to hell is paved with.\n\nThere are probably many reasons behind why she doesn't seem to care that her sister is dead.\n\nYou're still young and maybe haven't developed the filters or ability to read the situation. Or maybe you wanted everyone to see how sympathetic you are? Do some real introspection. After reading some comments, I see you thought you were alone. But still it was during a social event.  IMHO it was inappropriate. if you wanted to be empathetic to her, it should have been done in private. What if she'd started sobbing uncontrollably and ran out of the winery?\n\nIf you were looking to score points for yourself and feel important, then yeah, you were pretty much an ass. That or just very naive.\n\nEdit: didn't finish the thought. My brother died in his 30s and my best friend, who I called my sister, in our 40s. I know what it's like although I have no idea how anyone else grieves or what they're thinking. My friend's sister told me once that she's glad I talk about Sue, no one else will because maybe they think they'll make her sad, or they're just not comfortable with it. Some people just want to pretend death isn't real. Dont' mean to be harsh, but again, look deep into your reasons for bringing it up.  Maybe you can answer your own question.", "NTA, her sister was someone who was around for a lot of your life as well. There\u2019s nothing wrong with acknowledging the death, especially on the anniversary. Her response is honestly weird. I get that everyone processes differently but she\u2019s acting like it didn\u2019t matter. Maybe her boyfriend also finds that weird but that sure isn\u2019t your fault.", "NTA\n\nIt's hard to tell for sure, but Kate sounds like a sociopath.  She sounds shallow and vapid.  \n\nThat kind of response to heartfelt concern you expressed speaks volumes about her and nothing at all about you. \n\nYou're the good person here.", "NTA. *MOST* people appreciate their lost relatives being thought of and remembered so it was not unreasonable to say a few well meaning words. Kate is clearly not most people and she can grieve -or not- however she wants to but it was not wrong of you to say a few kind words.", "Everyone manages a family loss differently and sibling relationships are complicated. However, you had no reason to know this was supposed to be a secret. NTA.", "NTA. People can grieve in strange ways, but you couldn\u2019t have imagined that she never told her boyfriend about Megan. You\u2019re doing your best navigating a tricky situation.", "NTA. You were trying to be supportive. But can you really be close with somebody who sheds a sister with a shrug?", "I think you should worry less about what you may have done wrong and worry more about what kind of AH you call your friends.  NTA", "Yta for bringing it up. It seems like you\u2019re trying to impose your idea of what grieving is supposed to be on her sister.", "NTA.  You were not being morbid; you were being thoughtful by remembering someone that your friend lost on the first anniversary of their death.  Your friend lacks empathy.", "YTA. You said it yourself - everyone grieves differently, and it\u2019s not really about you. What a shock that she didn\u2019t appreciate you bringing it up at a social event, and oh yes, how dare she manage her grief her own way. And seriously, even if she isn\u2019t grieving and really doesn\u2019t care? It\u2019s none of your damned business.", "NTA, for all the other similar comments. Everyone grieves differently but that seems super cold of Kate, considering Megan was a part of your life as well. \n\nEDIT: In my own grief I have snapped at people, so I can understand if she was just trying to have a good day or whatnot.", "Gentle YTA. You were wrong to bring it up, as it didn't appear that she was acting like it was a \"special day\" so why did you assume it was? Esp since you've seen her behavior over the last year. If her sister wasn't important to her, that's her business.", "YTA stop trying to make her grief a thing. Clearly she is handling it in her own way", "YTA\n\nWhy are you so hung up on this and why is her grief any of your business?", "NTA\n\nYes, everyone grieves differently, but sociopaths don't grieve at all.  Maybe Kate is broken in other ways, but whatever is going on with her, you are probably best keeping your distance.\n\nI'm sorry for the loss of your friend.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I just kind of nodded like mm-hmm. Then she keeps going \"i can't believe it, i was so shocked!\" (Huh, imagine how me and my family felt!?) Meanwhile all these spectators in between us are swivelling their heads like they're watching a tennis match, wanting to know what's going on.
