Each time I was a bit hesitant with my response.. Some of my bf\u2019s family still lives out there & I felt a bit weird to not only meet them for the first time & stay in their home, but to also bring a best friend along with. \nPlus, selfishly, I just want to spend quality time with my bf without stressing to make sure my friend isn\u2019t being left out. \n\nRecently, my bf talked to his grandma and decided that we should go to Switzerland a few days after new years. Tickets would be cheaper and I can finally meet his grandma. \nI agreed with the plans & my bf paid for our flights. \n\nHowever, I knew my best friend would be upset if I told her we were going. \nI waited about two weeks until I finally broke the news to her. She seemed pretty excited at first but when she realized that she would not be coming with, she grew upset. \n\nShe argued that it was quite unfair considering I know she wants to go badly and that when she tries to plan trips with me, they never work out but with my bf, they always do (which is very untrue).\n\nI tried my best to reason with her and assured her that we would both go on a trip next year (since we are both saving for one). \nShe grew more quiet and eventually gave a very harsh \"It's fine.\"\n\nIt's been a few days now and my friend has not been reaching out. I love her to pieces but she can be a bit stressful at times. But I'm not sure if maybe I do owe her an apology.\n\nAITA for not telling and bringing my best friend on her dream vacation?\n\nEdit: I wasn\u2019t too clear but each time my friend begged me to let her join, I expressed to her that I wasn\u2019t sure in the moment since I haven\u2019t even met some of his family. She would pay for her stuff and would stay in a separate location- However she would still hang with me which is where I feel like it\u2019s not the most appropriate time. I did tell her I want to go again with her but just now right now. She wasn\u2019t upset that I didn\u2019t tell her right away, rather than I just didn\u2019t tell her at all so she could plan with me to join.", "created_utc": 1697253107, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/177g2u4/aita_for_booking_a_flight_with_my_boyfriend_to/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is quite capable of visiting the country on her own and you are not her keeper.", "No. If she's willing to pay for her own stuff, why hasn't she just gone already?  This is a private thing. She shouldn't want to impose.", "NTA. You might want to make sure that you have communicated with her that this isn\u2019t a vacation/tour of Switzerland so much as a trip for you to meet your bf\u2019s family.", "NTA. This is a thing that should be just you and him, if she can pay for her own trip she can go on her own or ask to plan a trip with you that\u2019s separate from you meeting his family for the first time.", "NTA.  Is she usually this codependent?  I can't imagine inviting myself on a trip with my friend and her boyfriend just because he's from a country I want to visit.  Either she and I plan our own trip or I go alone.", "A: Hey deae friend, I\u2019m going to visit my bf\u2019s family for the first time\nB: I will come with you \n\nIsn\u2019t that really awkward \ud83d\ude11", "NTA. Remind your dear friend that you will be meeting and staying with HIS family for the first time and it is not a good idea for him to introduce you to his family with a friend in tow. They are already going to be hosting you, and she expects them to host her as well, who is nothing to them or your boyfriend? That's a BIG ask.", "NTA\n\nAnd don\u2019t take your friend so seriously. Tell her no third wheels.", "in my opinion nta you want time with your bf and his family you can visit there with your friend after but i see where you're coming from", "That sucks that your friend reacted that way.  Unfortunately, we can't appease everyone and if she doesn't like your explanation, that's a her problem.  It's also presumptuous of her to invite herself to stay with people she's never met.  I think your friend will come around eventually.\n\nYou're NTA.", "Soft ESH You should\u2019ve been upfront/honest with your best friend from the get go because you obviously were uncomfortable.

Words. \n\n\"Sorry My Good Friend, the first time I go to Switzerland with my wonderful BF, it will be Act I of 'Meet the Family.' I will keep you in mind for subsequent trips, and bring you some nice chocolate.\"\n\nThis is what you should have said THE FIRST TIME IT CAME UP. \n\n\"Good Friend\" has unrealistic expectations and is pouty and needs to get over herself.", "YTA. You\u2019re not the asshole for booking a trip without her but if you\u2019re close, and you\u2019re going on an intimate trip with your boyfriend to meet his family - you should have just been straight up and upfront with her. Now it appears like you hid it from her because you feared a reaction and that\u2019s just not right. \n\nLike\u2026 I want to go to South Africa and my best friend is going next year with her South African fianc\u00e9e to meet his family. She told me about it first thing and actually made it a point to be super clear about it so I didn\u2019t feel like she was leaving me out on purpose. Nothing but good feels towards her trip.", "NTA - this trip is focused on meeting your bf\u2019s family and in no way involves your friend. Having her along would just make things awkward and stressful as you would have to entertain her and she would be the guest of a guest. There\u2019s no rule that she can\u2019t go to Switzerland on her own itinerary or you can\u2019t have a separate girls trip at a different time.", "ESH,\n\nThis trip was always about you and your BF, she was never going to be a part of it and you knew it. Why not be direct and say so? Sounds like you lead her on.\n\nIf you are best friends why do you feel like you have to walk on eggs around her?\n\nThat being said, she sounds entitled. Being disappointed is understandable if she was under the impression you would in fact factor her in in your plans. But her reaction sucks.\n\nYou should sit down and talk about why you felt you couldn\u2019t be direct with her because that seems like the main issue here.", "ESH you two should\u2019ve planned a separate trip from the start, you should\u2019ve been honest with her. You let her get her hopes up, even if she shouldn\u2019t have inserted herself in the first place.", "YTA. Considering she's your best friend you should have told her that you're going there. You could also tell her that this is a meet my parents trip so it wouldn't be a holiday so it would have been better if she didn't tag along as she'd have to stay in a hotel and you wouldn't be able to have activities with her.", "She's your friend who wanted to experience a new place with her friend that is understandable it is also understandable that you want to visit and enjoy a new place with your boyfriend she is dissapointed but she will come around when she gets used to the idea. Tell her you will scout out the best places for yours and hers visit at a later date this will build her excitement to see new horizons", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Exclusively. As such, bringing a friend along would be COMPLETELY out of place, from the moment you got off the plane in Switzerland to meet his waiting family, to the moment you waved goodbye as you boarded to return.

Which is reasonable.", "NTA but I live in Geneva and tell your friend January is the worst month to visit Switzerland, unless you go skiing. Post holiday, cold and not fun. She is not going to miss anything. In fact I don\u2019t know where to run away to in January and I wish I could spend the whole January and February somewhere else. There\u2019s absolutely nothing fun to do after the holidays. June / July or December are perfect.", "This. NTA. This is a bonding with bf and his family trip, not a \u201clet\u2019s explore Switzerland\u201d trip.", "She may be scared to travel there alone. Definitely shouldn't be trying to tag along on this trip", "Agreed. \n\nAlso I don\u2019t think the best friend understands that, even if she went and got a hotel etc, she\u2019s not going to get the holiday she wants. \n\nOP: visiting Switzerland to meet, spend time with and get to know her boyfriend\u2019s family. \n\nBoyfriend: going home to see his family and spend time with them, as well as introduce OP to more family members.\n\nBest friend: wants to visit Switzerland because it\u2019s one of her \u201cdream vacation spots.\u201d Clearly doesn\u2019t want to go alone or with someone else, even telling OP that, although she\u2019ll pay and stay at a separate location to the boyfriend\u2019s family, she will still \u201chang out\u201d with her.\n\nThe best friend won\u2019t get her dream vacation, unless she expects OP to prioritise going sightseeing with her instead of meeting her boyfriend\u2019s family - who OP is staying with. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOP, your friend really shouldn\u2019t have put you in this position in the first place. I doubt she\u2019ll be happy spending the majority of the trip getting to know your boyfriend\u2019s family and, given her reactions so far, she\u2019ll blame everyone but herself when she doesn\u2019t get the holiday she\u2019s always dreamed of. And it\u2019s not even as if you aren\u2019t already saving to go with her next year anyway. \n\nNTA.

But I think it likely she\u2019s at least 18. She should have the emotional maturity to know that tagging along on a trip with a friend who is expressly going to meet her BFs family is not a good idea. Friend is an entitled child. When she broke the news to said friend should not matter, be it months or days in advance. Friend should realize that going would be awkward at best, and likely downright rude to BFs family at worst. Friend\u2019s parents should take some blame because they never taught her that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her. OP is NTA.", ">Why not be direct and say so? Sounds like you lead her on.\n\n\nI think this is the best friend's problem. Op was never direct.
