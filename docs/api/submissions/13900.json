Your wife and you should be making this decision together, and do what is best for BOTH your children. \n\nYour daughter has a room. Your son needs a room and your grandson could use a room to themselves too. Just because your son is grown, he doesn't stop being your child, if at 39 he needs a year of help, well that's okay. \n\nSo, you two need to discuss and compromise, but you write this from the perspective of you being the decider. So first, realize you two need to compromise and your point of view carries no more weight than hers. Let's break down the arguments:\n\n1. Your daughter has 3 rooms, if she went down to one room she would still have her privacy and her own bedroom. \n2. Your daughter will not be able to utilize all the tools/books she has now for her hobbies, that is true. But no, she will not have to \"give up\" her hobbies. She can keep out some painting supplies and books, and refresh them as needed. She doesn't need a private library room to read a book, nor does she need a room full of art stuff to do art. You can absolutely make space for a pile of books and an easel somewhere in the house. \n3. Your daughter is 16, so now is a good time to think about consolidating her stuff. Did you plan on her having 3 rooms in your home forever? What do you think her space limitations will be as she goes to college and beyond (dorms, shared apartment, her own place)? She isn't going to have 3 rooms forever. \n4. You have a son and grandson to consider. Clearly, they are having a bit of a tough time. Do you value their need for space and privacy less than your daughter have amble space for each of her hobbies?\n5. Maybe your son has done deliberate things to put himself in this situation and you have no sympathy for him, But you also have a grandson to consider. I assume he isn't at fault for all this. Do you think it would be comfortable for him to share a room with his father for a year while seeing his Aunt (aka a teen the same age) have multiple rooms to herself? What do you think that would do for your relationship with your grandson, or the relationship between your daughter and him? Why wouldn't you want your grandson to have his own space too, when you can provide it for him? \n\nIf you don't want your son to move in, just admit that. But remember your wife is an equal partner in this marriage and in this space.", "YTA- not for not wanting to help- you sound like a giant jerk who disapproves of whatever choice your son made, and you want him and his kid to suffer for it (FYI you are officially in the running for grandparent of the year).  YTA for using the fact that your spoiled rotten daughter is throwing a hissy fit about her precious space as your reason for not allowing him to move in.  Be honest, you hate your son, and want him and his kid to suffer because they didn't listen to you.  \n\n Better hope your spoiled brat of a daughter is capable of supporting herself and being a productive member of society with the attitude you have fostered in her, because she is going to be the only support available to you in your old age.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s older and had previously moved out. That is your son. As someone who\u2019s also an avid reader and crafts, you don\u2019t need three rooms to do that, no matter the size. If she really has enough books to fill an entire room, have her get rid of some of them! Get her an ereader, or hey, bold choice, but tell her to go to the actual library and borrow books.", "YTA Your son needs to sleep somewhere and you can't give him a bedroom? Your daughter has three! Empty one of the rooms out for your son. You say that wouldn't be fair to your daughter what about being fair to your son? Combine the library and the painting room and let your son have the third one.", "Soft YTA. It\u2019s more ridiculous than an AH. Your 16 year old doesn\u2019t need a library AND a painting room. Consolidate the two and make a small guest room for your son/other guests.", "YTA. Get her a kindle or other e-reader that she can read off of for a while your son gets back on his feet.  Let her keep what will fit of the art stuff in her room and store the rest while your son tries to fix whatever has gone wrong in his life that necessitates having to move back in with a father who clearly doesn't think he deserves that help.\n\nIt will he a good lesson for your spoiled daughter in empathy and prioritizing what of her things are the most important to her.", "So basically, you just don\u2019t want your 39yr son and his family moving back in with you, and you are using your daughter as an excuse. That make you the asshole in this situation.", "YTA, if anything at least put the paint stuff in the book room, especially if it\u2019s only for a few months.

Thinking cap on, dude.\n\nYou are acting as if she has anything less than 3 dedicated rooms, that she is being oppressed. That is not the reality now, or in her adult future.

No roommate will tolerate her having wet paint inches from their clothes and bedding, that's for sure. And she maybe can bring along 20 books at best.

It would be extremely selfish of his aunt (who is younger than him so probably a lot more like a cousin than an aunt and definitely not an adult authority figure in his life) to lay claim to so much space when he is losing his home.\n\nOP says the bedrooms are small, so chances are they\u2019re not big enough to have 3 people in 1 room. If there is physically not enough space in the daughter\u2019s room to fit her bed and a temporary art station that gets packed up when not in use, how could they fit enough mattress space for 3 people in a single room? It is very likely that the daughter already has the biggest bedroom, besides the parents of course. Maybe a better compromise would be to clear out 1 room for OP and his wife move into, leaving the master bedroom for their son and his family.\n\nAs far as the length of time, as I said before, set a limit. Make it less than a year if having them all there long term would be too difficult, it may even be worth going to a lawyer and having a contract drawn up with a specific move-out date and then hold the son and his family to that.\n\nI think there\u2019s a lot of space to compromise between \u201cdaughter gives up all of her space\u201d and \u201cbad luck for son and family they just get to be homeless\u201d but without knowing the size of the rooms and finer details about the house to suggest spaces that could be made available, it is hard to provide further advice.

That is how the daughter ended up with 3 small rooms\n\nA storage locker would cost money.  So daughter storing her 2 hobbies in 1 room at no cost, and other kid and kid\u2019s kid sharing a room means no extra spending on storing the hobbies.

It's time to think through the problem and be creative. Sorry for the long post, I obviously feel strongly about this, lol!\n\nI'd probably do the following depending on the budget. With free furniture and a couple of trips to Home Depot and Diy videos, you can find things to make it work and look pretty cool:\n\n1. Agree with your wife that 2 rooms will be made available for sleeping and going forward when the guests are gone there will be a dedicated guest room. \n\n2. Tell daughter you are temporarily going to have 1.5 rooms and later will have 2, not 3 rooms. Going forward, the fourth room is a guest room. She can hang out and read in it, use the desk, but it will be ready for company. Maybe op or OPs wife could use more space or a room with a bed and a desk occasionally. Guide her into going through her books and art supplies and throwing out paint that has expired and donating a few books if she wants to. It's likely that if she culls and organizes both hobbies, they will take up less space. Get cute bins from Ikea to keep it neat.\n\n3. Explain to your son and nephew that one room will be 100 open for nephew, and the other will be available for sleeping for your son. This room is also an art studio during the day. This can add motivation to not get too comfortable for the 39 year old son. Add a curtain room divider if needed to add privacy. \n\n4. Add a reading loft to her existing room or bookshelves with a ladder like Beauty and the Beast and/or a window seat,  maybe repaint and add a new set of linens and curtains. The reading room can be in the bedroom with a bit of shelving and a comfy seat. Nice lamps and lighting \ud83d\udc4c Involve her in this from planning to painting. \n\n5. Turn the 3rd room into a comfortable guest room with a decent bed and desk and move nephew here.\n \n6. Turn the 4th room into an art studio with a convertible futon or sofa. Make it a multifunctional space that she will like once it is no longer in use. Storage and shelving for supplies and a comfortable sleeping area. Involve her in the process. Maybe she can even paint a mural on the closet?\n\n7. Tell your son to share the space for her art during the day after school and on weekends after 9am and before 9pm. (Or whatever is reasonable).\n\n8. Tell your daughter to give him privacy and make it work temporarily. Have some sketchbooks in her room or the living room, a rolling art cart she can grab quickly from the room. \n\n9. Cool Bonus (if you can afford it and have a good place): Add a good outdoor space for art. Have her help and build it together. The natural light is great for art. Do you have a covered area outside already? Add a rock garden, a trendy egg chair. A table and stool. That rolling art supply cart mentioned above can roll outside. Add a storage cabinet for easels and one of those outdoor heater lamps they have at bars. Just be creative and figure out some options. \n\nFigure out a plan that works for everyone and get back an extra room for the household. 3 rooms is ridiculous, no matter how small they are for any one person in a 4 bedroom house with 3 people.... regardless of guests or not.", "That\u2019s kinda the point though, if it sucks for them they\u2019ll actually leave as soon as they can afford too.
