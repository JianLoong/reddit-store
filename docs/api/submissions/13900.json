Your wife and you should be making this decision together, and do what is best for BOTH your children. \n\nYour daughter has a room. Your son needs a room and your grandson could use a room to themselves too. Just because your son is grown, he doesn't stop being your child, if at 39 he needs a year of help, well that's okay. \n\nSo, you two need to discuss and compromise, but you write this from the perspective of you being the decider. So first, realize you two need to compromise and your point of view carries no more weight than hers. Let's break down the arguments:\n\n1. Your daughter has 3 rooms, if she went down to one room she would still have her privacy and her own bedroom. \n2. Your daughter will not be able to utilize all the tools/books she has now for her hobbies, that is true. But no, she will not have to \"give up\" her hobbies. She can keep out some painting supplies and books, and refresh them as needed. She doesn't need a private library room to read a book, nor does she need a room full of art stuff to do art. You can absolutely make space for a pile of books and an easel somewhere in the house. \n3. Your daughter is 16, so now is a good time to think about consolidating her stuff. Did you plan on her having 3 rooms in your home forever? What do you think her space limitations will be as she goes to college and beyond (dorms, shared apartment, her own place)? She isn't going to have 3 rooms forever. \n4. You have a son and grandson to consider. Clearly, they are having a bit of a tough time. Do you value their need for space and privacy less than your daughter have amble space for each of her hobbies?\n5. Maybe your son has done deliberate things to put himself in this situation and you have no sympathy for him, But you also have a grandson to consider. I assume he isn't at fault for all this. Do you think it would be comfortable for him to share a room with his father for a year while seeing his Aunt (aka a teen the same age) have multiple rooms to herself? What do you think that would do for your relationship with your grandson, or the relationship between your daughter and him? Why wouldn't you want your grandson to have his own space too, when you can provide it for him? \n\nIf you don't want your son to move in, just admit that. But remember your wife is an equal partner in this marriage and in this space.", "YTA- not for not wanting to help- you sound like a giant jerk who disapproves of whatever choice your son made, and you want him and his kid to suffer for it (FYI you are officially in the running for grandparent of the year).  YTA for using the fact that your spoiled rotten daughter is throwing a hissy fit about her precious space as your reason for not allowing him to move in.  Be honest, you hate your son, and want him and his kid to suffer because they didn't listen to you.  \n\n Better hope your spoiled brat of a daughter is capable of supporting herself and being a productive member of society with the attitude you have fostered in her, because she is going to be the only support available to you in your old age.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s older and had previously moved out. That is your son. As someone who\u2019s also an avid reader and crafts, you don\u2019t need three rooms to do that, no matter the size. If she really has enough books to fill an entire room, have her get rid of some of them! Get her an ereader, or hey, bold choice, but tell her to go to the actual library and borrow books.", "YTA Your son needs to sleep somewhere and you can't give him a bedroom? Your daughter has three! Empty one of the rooms out for your son. You say that wouldn't be fair to your daughter what about being fair to your son? Combine the library and the painting room and let your son have the third one.", "Soft YTA. It\u2019s more ridiculous than an AH. Your 16 year old doesn\u2019t need a library AND a painting room. Consolidate the two and make a small guest room for your son/other guests.", "YTA. Get her a kindle or other e-reader that she can read off of for a while your son gets back on his feet.  Let her keep what will fit of the art stuff in her room and store the rest while your son tries to fix whatever has gone wrong in his life that necessitates having to move back in with a father who clearly doesn't think he deserves that help.\n\nIt will he a good lesson for your spoiled daughter in empathy and prioritizing what of her things are the most important to her.", "So basically, you just don\u2019t want your 39yr son and his family moving back in with you, and you are using your daughter as an excuse. That make you the asshole in this situation.", "YTA, if anything at least put the paint stuff in the book room, especially if it\u2019s only for a few months.

Thinking cap on, dude.\n\nYou are acting as if she has anything less than 3 dedicated rooms, that she is being oppressed. That is not the reality now, or in her adult future.

No roommate will tolerate her having wet paint inches from their clothes and bedding, that's for sure. And she maybe can bring along 20 books at best.

It would be extremely selfish of his aunt (who is younger than him so probably a lot more like a cousin than an aunt and definitely not an adult authority figure in his life) to lay claim to so much space when he is losing his home.\n\nOP says the bedrooms are small, so chances are they\u2019re not big enough to have 3 people in 1 room. If there is physically not enough space in the daughter\u2019s room to fit her bed and a temporary art station that gets packed up when not in use, how could they fit enough mattress space for 3 people in a single room? It is very likely that the daughter already has the biggest bedroom, besides the parents of course. Maybe a better compromise would be to clear out 1 room for OP and his wife move into, leaving the master bedroom for their son and his family.\n\nAs far as the length of time, as I said before, set a limit. Make it less than a year if having them all there long term would be too difficult, it may even be worth going to a lawyer and having a contract drawn up with a specific move-out date and then hold the son and his family to that.\n\nI think there\u2019s a lot of space to compromise between \u201cdaughter gives up all of her space\u201d and \u201cbad luck for son and family they just get to be homeless\u201d but without knowing the size of the rooms and finer details about the house to suggest spaces that could be made available, it is hard to provide further advice. OP needs to sit down with his wife and daughter and have a calm conversation in which they knuckle down the details, no one is going to be completely happy but it could be a lot better than it is.", "The grandson is 17. So watching him wouldn\u2019t be an issue but still taking one room with a loft bed and a pull out couch would be more than reasonable for temporary guests. The wife cares more about their comfort which makes it\u2019s seem like she won\u2019t push for them to ever leave while op and his daughter who don\u2019t want them there will be miserable", "They don\u2019t even need to be boxed up - they can stay on the shelves and she can bring the book she\u2019s reading to her room.", "It\u2019s son,daughter-in-law and grandson", "I have obviously missed some comments or edits because I had no idea the grandson was 17! \n\nThis poor 16 year old, who has always been an only child in her day to day reality, is being told that she\u2019s expected to upend her entire life because of her 40 year old brother\u2019s mistakes. I think we all can probably guess that once the brother and his family move in, they won\u2019t be moving out anytime soon. And I\u2019m guessing the 16 year old knows this. \n\nI\u2019ve seen suggestions regarding renting a storage unit for the 16 year old\u2019s things. That\u2019s the least that must be done, IMO. However, is she supposed to go paint or draw in the storage unit? Is she supposed to set up a reading nook in the storage unit? And no, for some of us, a Kindle doesn\u2019t cut it. We love actual books. \n\nOP and his wife risk losing their daughter. Maybe she won\u2019t go NC, but she\u2019ll never forget this. Let the OP and his wife move out of their room, sleep in the living or family room, give their room to 40 year old son, give one of 26 year old\u2019s rooms to 27 year old grandson, and allow 16 year old daughter to hang onto her safe space by keeping one of the rooms. \n\nI hope their 40 year old child and his family are enough for them in the coming years.", "The son should be paying to store the daughters things and paying a portion of the household expenses at the very least. And I\u2019d side with the wife if she wasn\u2019t trying to make them comfortable. They don\u2019t need to be comfortable, they need a place to not be exposed to the elements. They can survive in one room with a loft and a pull out plus storage bins. If everyone\u2019s so worried about the grandsons privacy then the son and his wife can stay out of the room until it\u2019s time for bed. Op and his daughter shouldn\u2019t be the only ones to sacrifice."]}
