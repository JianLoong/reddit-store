Your wife and you should be making this decision together, and do what is best for BOTH your children. \n\nYour daughter has a room. Your son needs a room and your grandson could use a room to themselves too. Just because your son is grown, he doesn't stop being your child, if at 39 he needs a year of help, well that's okay. \n\nSo, you two need to discuss and compromise, but you write this from the perspective of you being the decider. So first, realize you two need to compromise and your point of view carries no more weight than hers. Let's break down the arguments:\n\n1. Your daughter has 3 rooms, if she went down to one room she would still have her privacy and her own bedroom. \n2. Your daughter will not be able to utilize all the tools/books she has now for her hobbies, that is true. But no, she will not have to \"give up\" her hobbies. She can keep out some painting supplies and books, and refresh them as needed. She doesn't need a private library room to read a book, nor does she need a room full of art stuff to do art. You can absolutely make space for a pile of books and an easel somewhere in the house. \n3. Your daughter is 16, so now is a good time to think about consolidating her stuff. Did you plan on her having 3 rooms in your home forever? What do you think her space limitations will be as she goes to college and beyond (dorms, shared apartment, her own place)? She isn't going to have 3 rooms forever. \n4. You have a son and grandson to consider. Clearly, they are having a bit of a tough time. Do you value their need for space and privacy less than your daughter have amble space for each of her hobbies?\n5. Maybe your son has done deliberate things to put himself in this situation and you have no sympathy for him, But you also have a grandson to consider. I assume he isn't at fault for all this. Do you think it would be comfortable for him to share a room with his father for a year while seeing his Aunt (aka a teen the same age) have multiple rooms to herself? What do you think that would do for your relationship with your grandson, or the relationship between your daughter and him? Why wouldn't you want your grandson to have his own space too, when you can provide it for him? \n\nIf you don't want your son to move in, just admit that. But remember your wife is an equal partner in this marriage and in this space.", "YTA- not for not wanting to help- you sound like a giant jerk who disapproves of whatever choice your son made, and you want him and his kid to suffer for it (FYI you are officially in the running for grandparent of the year).  YTA for using the fact that your spoiled rotten daughter is throwing a hissy fit about her precious space as your reason for not allowing him to move in.  Be honest, you hate your son, and want him and his kid to suffer because they didn't listen to you.  \n\n Better hope your spoiled brat of a daughter is capable of supporting herself and being a productive member of society with the attitude you have fostered in her, because she is going to be the only support available to you in your old age.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s older and had previously moved out. That is your son. As someone who\u2019s also an avid reader and crafts, you don\u2019t need three rooms to do that, no matter the size. If she really has enough books to fill an entire room, have her get rid of some of them! Get her an ereader, or hey, bold choice, but tell her to go to the actual library and borrow books.", "YTA Your son needs to sleep somewhere and you can't give him a bedroom? Your daughter has three! Empty one of the rooms out for your son. You say that wouldn't be fair to your daughter what about being fair to your son? Combine the library and the painting room and let your son have the third one.", "Soft YTA. It\u2019s more ridiculous than an AH. Your 16 year old doesn\u2019t need a library AND a painting room.

Let her keep what will fit of the art stuff in her room and store the rest while your son tries to fix whatever has gone wrong in his life that necessitates having to move back in with a father who clearly doesn't think he deserves that help.\n\nIt will he a good lesson for your spoiled daughter in empathy and prioritizing what of her things are the most important to her.", "So basically, you just don\u2019t want your 39yr son and his family moving back in with you, and you are using your daughter as an excuse.

Thinking cap on, dude.\n\nYou are acting as if she has anything less than 3 dedicated rooms, that she is being oppressed. That is not the reality now, or in her adult future.

No roommate will tolerate her having wet paint inches from their clothes and bedding, that's for sure. And she maybe can bring along 20 books at best.

I do think your sons family having a roof over their heads is a priority as it is a need vs your daughter wanting her 3 rooms.

If not, she may need to rearrange her bedroom and just keep some of her books and painting supplies there while the others are put into storage, like your wife suggested.

It would be extremely selfish of his aunt (who is younger than him so probably a lot more like a cousin than an aunt and definitely not an adult authority figure in his life) to lay claim to so much space when he is losing his home.\n\nOP says the bedrooms are small, so chances are they\u2019re not big enough to have 3 people in 1 room. If there is physically not enough space in the daughter\u2019s room to fit her bed and a temporary art station that gets packed up when not in use, how could they fit enough mattress space for 3 people in a single room? It is very likely that the daughter already has the biggest bedroom, besides the parents of course. Maybe a better compromise would be to clear out 1 room for OP and his wife move into, leaving the master bedroom for their son and his family.\n\nAs far as the length of time, as I said before, set a limit. Make it less than a year if having them all there long term would be too difficult, it may even be worth going to a lawyer and having a contract drawn up with a specific move-out date and then hold the son and his family to that.\n\nI think there\u2019s a lot of space to compromise between \u201cdaughter gives up all of her space\u201d and \u201cbad luck for son and family they just get to be homeless\u201d but without knowing the size of the rooms and finer details about the house to suggest spaces that could be made available, it is hard to provide further advice.

That is how the daughter ended up with 3 small rooms\n\nA storage locker would cost money.  So daughter storing her 2 hobbies in 1 room at no cost, and other kid and kid\u2019s kid sharing a room means no extra spending on storing the hobbies.

With free furniture and a couple of trips to Home Depot and Diy videos, you can find things to make it work and look pretty cool:\n\n1. Agree with your wife that 2 rooms will be made available for sleeping and going forward when the guests are gone there will be a dedicated guest room. \n\n2. Tell daughter you are temporarily going to have 1.5 rooms and later will have 2, not 3 rooms. Going forward, the fourth room is a guest room. She can hang out and read in it, use the desk, but it will be ready for company. Maybe op or OPs wife could use more space or a room with a bed and a desk occasionally. Guide her into going through her books and art supplies and throwing out paint that has expired and donating a few books if she wants to. It's likely that if she culls and organizes both hobbies, they will take up less space. Get cute bins from Ikea to keep it neat.\n\n3. Explain to your son and nephew that one room will be 100 open for nephew, and the other will be available for sleeping for your son. This room is also an art studio during the day. This can add motivation to not get too comfortable for the 39 year old son. Add a curtain room divider if needed to add privacy. \n\n4. Add a reading loft to her existing room or bookshelves with a ladder like Beauty and the Beast and/or a window seat,  maybe repaint and add a new set of linens and curtains. The reading room can be in the bedroom with a bit of shelving and a comfy seat. Nice lamps and lighting \ud83d\udc4c Involve her in this from planning to painting. \n\n5. Turn the 3rd room into a comfortable guest room with a decent bed and desk and move nephew here.\n \n6. Turn the 4th room into an art studio with a convertible futon or sofa. Make it a multifunctional space that she will like once it is no longer in use. Storage and shelving for supplies and a comfortable sleeping area. Involve her in the process. Maybe she can even paint a mural on the closet?\n\n7. Tell your son to share the space for her art during the day after school and on weekends after 9am and before 9pm. (Or whatever is reasonable).\n\n8. Tell your daughter to give him privacy and make it work temporarily. Have some sketchbooks in her room or the living room, a rolling art cart she can grab quickly from the room. \n\n9. Cool Bonus (if you can afford it and have a good place): Add a good outdoor space for art. Have her help and build it together. The natural light is great for art. Do you have a covered area outside already? Add a rock garden, a trendy egg chair. A table and stool. That rolling art supply cart mentioned above can roll outside. Add a storage cabinet for easels and one of those outdoor heater lamps they have at bars. Just be creative and figure out some options. \n\nFigure out a plan that works for everyone and get back an extra room for the household. 3 rooms is ridiculous, no matter how small they are for any one person in a 4 bedroom house with 3 people.... regardless of guests or not.", "That\u2019s kinda the point though, if it sucks for them they\u2019ll actually leave as soon as they can afford too.

I know I flipped my lid when I was 16 and hand picked a bunch of books to lend to a family friends daughter and my mom wanted me to just drop asking to get them back. Like woman, I want those back because they're important to me and maybe, you know, I want to share with MY kids.

With someone as cruel and wicked as OP I can\u2019t imagine his son is going to linger a minute longer than absolutely necessary.  Sometimes, having family to lean on can allow the time necessary to make smarter moves than having to rush into whatever apartment/job comes first especially with a 17 year old in tow. The mom seems to be the only decent human being in the bunch. Dad and daughter deserve eachother.

Everyone has made the conclusion that she is spoiled. She could have emotional issues.  She could have mental issues.  Nobody knows.  But to assume that she HAS to give up the things that apparently help her to cope and grow.  There are programs everywhere for those who are going to be homeless.  If it is that serious then  having one room with a pull out bunk to queen with single on top for sleeping should be acceptable.  \nNo ne is thinking how this is going to impact the family unit. Especially a 16 year old girl who is being forced to live with three people who do not like her or get along with her.  How fair is that.  Then on top of that to tell her she is losing her space.   I believe that a compromise is that brother and his family get one room. It is just to sleep.  Combine the spaces into one room even if it pack up books and put them in paint room.   No one also has recognized that if she dedicated a separate space for painting it maybe what she is going to do for a living. So having a dedicated space is needed.  Dad said he had no issue with giving one room nor did daughter. However mom and son are not willing to compromise.  They want two rooms period.   He deserves nothing.   If his family choices to help he should take the one room and make it work for the time he needs to get on his feet. \nHis son is already showing a demanding attitude. How will he be after he moves in with his 17 year old son and wife.   I see nothing but turbulence and arguments.  Sounds like the one entitled is the son.  He screws up and expects his sister to turn her life upside down to accommodate him and his family. \nI agree that family needs to help.  The father and sister have agreed to give them one room.   That however is not good enough for the son.  He should take it and be happy he is not homeless. With all the up bevel that will happen I believe the daughter is going to need her hobby room more than ever.  I hear people saying the daughter is spoiled and who needs three rooms. It is not a case of  need. She has been allowed  to have these spaces.  She has been an only child. By the age difference I am going to assume the son was also an only child while being raised.  It sounds to me that son is jealous of his sister who came along to ness up his only child life.  We do not know all the dynamics. However I do feel like just because son messed up that daughter should have to turn her whole world upside down especially for people who do not get Ali g with her.  Put yourselves in that situation. 16 and having a great life. Then being forced to alter the things that make u happy.  Causing you to have limits to your things.

Take the grandson, not the parents? So many better solutions than everyone living together indefinitely.", "ESH\n\nSome accommodation needs to be figured out for the son and his family.\n\nBut the daughter's things aren't disposable or frivolous.  \n\nFor a serious bookworm, by age 16, she's been building her library for at least a decade.  The books have memories attached - were gifts, or things she saved for, etc.  If she needs to move them from the room she's using as a library, she needs storage space that will keep the books from being damaged, and leave them accessible when she wants to read or re-read them.  Just buying a kindle and dumping a collection built over a lifetime would be cruel.  If these books are destroyed, it will likely damage her relationship with the rest of the family.\n\nAs for the art room, it sounds as if she's quite serious about her art.  At 16, this is not necessarily just a child's hobby.  Many high schools have fairly extensive art departments, and building her portfolio is important if she's considering a career that will use her artistic skills. And many careers do use artistic skills.  I know people who majored in art who had jobs at hospitals, doing medical illustration for educational materials, people who went on to work in design, or advertising, or a wide variety of other fields.  If the parents are responsible, they'll consider her level of skill and interest, and they'll be careful not to sabotage her future success because of her older brother's failures.  And depending on the daughter's interests and talents, an art room may not be limited to things like paint and drawing supplies, but might also have very specialized and expensive computer equipment that is used for creating digital art.  Such equipment would need to be protected - you can't have a teenage nephew older than she is thinking it's just another computer, that he can use for gaming, the internet, etc.  \n\nIt also sounds as if there are issues with the brother's family respecting boundaries, such as the brother's wife being \"nosy.\"  \n\nIf the brother and his family are to move in, there need to be boundaries set, and it needs to respect the needs of everyone in the household.  Getting rid of many (most?) of the daughter's possessions to move in three people she probably doesn't really know well or feel close to, with no set date for them to leave, and no defined boundaries that will protect the daughter's privacy and peace, is a recipe for disaster.  Particularly moving a teenage boy into a house with a teenage girl - you need to be very sure that there is privacy, and firm boundaries, and respect for personal space.  \n\nThe potential problems with this situation go far beyond merely displacing the daughter from much of her living space, and disposing of her possessions.  Moving in a 40 year old, and his wife, who are used to being in charge of their own household, is setting up conflict.  Probably made worse because there will likely be a lot of conflict between the brother and his wife, because of all the financial stress, and blame games about what caused this financial disaster.  Both the grandson and the daughter have lived their entire lives as only children, and adapting to a crowded household will not be straightforward, especially if the grandson resents being displaced from his home, while the daughter resents having her possessions and activities treated as disposable, and the intrusion of three people she isn't close to into her home. \n\nThere also is not a meaningful sibling relationship between the son and daughter.  He was 23 when she was born. Effectively, they're two only-children, in terms of how they lived growing up.  \n\nAnd the whole thing seems concerningly open-ended.  They need to move in for a few months, maybe a year?  How long, exactly?  What plan do the son and his wife have for getting back on their feet financially?  \n\nBoth the grandson and the daughter are getting close to the point of applying for college. Are the son and his wife in a position to provide their child with needed support?  Will OP and his wife help with the grandson's college expenses?  If so, how will that affect what is available  for the daughter?  What resources are there to help both kids deal with the chaos that this move will cause for them, so that it doesn't adversely affect their educations?  \n\nI'd also add that OP's responsibilities to their older and younger children are quite different.  The son is an adult, and while it is good if they can help him out, he is still in a \"beggars can't be choosers\" situation, where he isn't owed help.

Family therapy for OP, wife and daughter.  Also for the entire group of six, to facilitate getting the enlarged household to function smoothly.

I see a lot of people saying that the daughter doesn\u2019t need three rooms, but neither does your son need them by that argument. And your daughter is still a minor who lives there and will for quite awhile. You are doing your adult son a favor by letting him move back home. He can be grateful for one room instead of demanding three. Plus, if you take away all her rooms and give them to your son, you will be causing a lot of resentment in your daughter.\n\nAre both your biological children, or is one a step?

If it's legitimately to get on back on their feet, they can compromise for the year.\n\nDon't punish your grandson and daughter, they're innocents in this. The art room/ library can be a place where they can both study.\n\nIf your son doesn't want to accept this arrangement  you could tell him to find someone willing to put up with him. But you could let your grandson stay with you in this situation until his father pulls himself together.\n\nIt sounds callous, but don't make your son too comfortable. It seems like he's made a string of very bad decisions,  and this with advice that they are bad decisions, but decided to go ahead with them anyway. Knowing this about him it wouldn't surprise me that he would want to prolong his stay as much as he could. Also,  you said your daughter in law is nosey in everyone's business and you and your daughter don't get along with your son and his wife; this is even more reason for them to get their shit together as quickly as they can and move on.\n\nHonestly, if it wasn't for the additional information about your son I would've said that your daughter should give up both extra rooms.

If your daughter has enough books that take up a full room, what are the odds that she is going to actually read everyone of them for the year your son/grandson stay?\n\nSimilar with the library, your daughter does not need a paint room. She can pack her paint stuff in a storage cart and can easily move it around in the house and paint in different rooms, even in the garage, kitchen etc. \n\nMost kids have 1 bedroom that they use for all of their stuff or even share rooms with siblings.
