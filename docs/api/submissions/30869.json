I tell her \"I don't care, go ahead. What are you going to do, frame it?\" So she's just standing there taking pictures of us until finally we all walk away pissed off.\n\nSo AITA?

They eat, they shit, the water PH goes all nuts in the lake, no water plants, no fish, shore trees die back, water deoxygenates, algae blooms, lake is screwed, beaver is bummed, migratory ducks are in bad shape, people get sad when the city has to addle goose eggs and hire dog teams to harass the excess geese. It turns out it was all down to one older couple who would buy a 50 pound bag of feed grain every week, slash it open and leave it out for the geese.

Why did she walk in front of you if you were recording a video? Its easy to tell when someone is doing that (since you said she walled past) like\u2026 i\u2019m confused about that. If i saw someone recording something and didnt want to be in it, id stop for a sec and wait till they\u2019re done or go around. And like you said, you weren\u2019t recording her specifically.

He tried to run us off the road while we were going 70 mph on an interstate, he nearly caused us to crash....all because my sister posted a picture of us at a local place without my knowing. He saw it and tracked us down as we were leaving and followed us. \n\nMy point is this : You never know why people desire privacy, but you should respect their wishes either way, and not doing so is an AH move. I don't have to worry anymore, for now, because the guy that did all of that to me has since been put back in jail after raping and beating up another young woman and almost killing her a few years back, this time for 30 years....But what you did was careless, entitled and selfish.\n\n Totally legal in your case?

Unless something happens you don\u2019t. And after some time the video it overwritten with a new one. Same with cctv. No one really checks it unless something happens. \nA video on a private phone? Not so much. How many times the video will be viewed? Even if he won\u2019t post on online, how many people op will show it personally? It\u2019s like 200 ducks, of course he will. And he will show it unedited. So yes he will show everyone her face, her clothes, etc. Op started filming HER. She\u2019s on the video. So of course she was rude m. He did not ask her beforehand if she\u2019s ok with it. And then after she made it clear, she\u2019s uncomfortable instead of stopping and deleting the video op kept going. \nSorry but op is AH. I also don\u2019t want to be photographed by a random stranger. That\u2019s totally different from dashcams and cctv.", "Best answer so far.", "He wasn't doing anything wrong by just filming her. Refusing to delete footage he had of her after she didn't consent to it is a different story though. This isn't the same as having a dash cam or a security camera. People don't  generally object to you having a dash cam because they have no reason to believe it will be posted to the internet, unlike being filmed by a phone in public.\n\nRealistically the ducks were apparently still right there, he could have just said \"fine\" and took another video of them, problem solved for everyone. But his legal right for him to tape strangers in public was important enough to him for him to want to teach this woman a lesson I guess. That does make him a bit of a dick imo\n\nShe should have been nicer about it and just asked him politely, so she is kind of an asshole too because he wasn't doing anything wrong. But just because you're legally in your rights to not delete footage you have of a stranger who's asking you to doesn't mean it's always the right thing to do. It's not like it's illegal in other countries for no good reasons.\n\nOne reason I can think of is what if the person has a stalker they moved to escape from or is in a witness protection program or something and this video gets spread around the internet, it could put their life in danger because it tells people she lives near this park and comes there. You don't know people's lives and why they don't want to be filmed. Why not just be respectful when it wouldn't inconvenience you to do so", "I respect people's desire for privacy, I really do.

In much the same way as I don't need to justify my disability to you to park in a disabled parking space, I don't need to justify my desire to take a picture to you to take a picture in a public place. \n\nAfter all, where does this end?  If you're in the background of the beautiful sunset pictures I took of my wife on the last day of my honeymoon and could never retake, do I still have to delete them? \n\nIf you're in the background of the pictures I took at my mom's funeral?\n\nOr a thousand other scenarios where a unique memory can't be recaptured?\n\nWhy do the stranger's rights supersede my own?  \n\nOP doesn't know that person, she's not important to them at all, and they will probably never meet again. Why is she so important that OP has to delete their cool memories of ducks?  OP wasn't deliberately filming this person, I agree that would be rude. \n\nI guess I just feel like people that expect to never be in the background of other people's photos or videos have unrealistic expectations.", "I'm not police but thanks for your input", "So as an example.
