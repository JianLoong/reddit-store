Why did she walk in front of you if you were recording a video? Its easy to tell when someone is doing that (since you said she walled past) like\u2026 i\u2019m confused about that. If i saw someone recording something and didnt want to be in it, id stop for a sec and wait till they\u2019re done or go around. And like you said, you weren\u2019t recording her specifically.

The one accidental run-in I had with him was a year after he got out....My sister was driving me through my hometown, where we both used to live. He tried to run us off the road while we were going 70 mph on an interstate, he nearly caused us to crash....all because my sister posted a picture of us at a local place without my knowing. He saw it and tracked us down as we were leaving and followed us. \n\nMy point is this : You never know why people desire privacy, but you should respect their wishes either way, and not doing so is an AH move. I don't have to worry anymore, for now, because the guy that did all of that to me has since been put back in jail after raping and beating up another young woman and almost killing her a few years back, this time for 30 years....But what you did was careless, entitled and selfish.\n\n Totally legal in your case?

Keep pointing your fingers at Reddit, go crazy why don't ya..", "I think the counter argument would be that whilst it\u2019s not illegal to film the woman, and her behaviour could have been more polite, it is still asshole behaviour to film someone when they have asked you not to. \n\nIt\u2019s different if someone is just in the background of a video, but in this case the event OP is filming is 300 ducks following a woman. She is part of his focus.\n\nAlso, she doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s telling the truth  when he says he isn\u2019t going to upload it. She doesn\u2019t know him from Adam.\n\nAs is so often, it comes down to what someone\u2019s definition of \u201cassholery\u201d is. To me, it\u2019s not about being technically or legally right. It\u2019s about whether your behaviour is petty, rude, mean-spirited etc. \n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m writing this during the school rush so it\u2019s not half as eloquent as the comment you\u2019re replying to, but I hope it demonstrates that not everyone is a drive-by downvoter.

Marketing, advertising are different situation and covered by difference case law as they are part of a commercial endvor. It's the classic 'offer them at least a euro and get it in writting so you can use the shot' thing we had to learn in media law at university.   Journalism and most non-commerical creative persuits are convered under freedom of expression and have different protections and don't require licencing. The one major exception would be if the person's identity plays a central roll in the created media and the author is commenting on their identity through their work and they aren't considered a public figure.  It's more tricky and nuanced in Germany than in the US, but if we had to get permission from everyone in every shot like people often think, there would be no way for my profession to even exist.", "That's great honestly, not excessive - just respectful.

Depending on the country you might be able to keep the video if you don't share it anywhere, but sharing is illegal in all of the EU regardless of if you're monetarily benefiting from it.

You give consent when you walk in and don\u2019t leave. There\u2019s often a disclaimer on the front door. \n\nPublic property?  You\u2019re free to take photos and record videos to your heart\u2019s content. Basically, in those circumstances, there can\u2019t be an expectation of privacy!

And many others here. That's also not the opinion that many others, here or elsewhere, share. I would at least say the response was unreasonable, had she actually asked rather than demanded, myself. But if you can look at it from a perspective of understanding that not everyone looks at that topic the same way (actually it seems like it's very much either \"that's wrong\" or \"the law says this is fine\"), you can start to understand why the beginning of that interaction matters. Like you said, it depends on each individual persons definition of \"assholery\", but then by extension understanding that exists. \n\nAll this relies on OP being a reliable narrator, though that's the case in pretty much...everything everywhere? By how it was framed it didn't sound like OP had any ill intentions, nor was rude or mean spirited. Maybe petty in response to the initial interaction? I'm not even saying I disagree with your viewpoint (with a few caveats, like switching AITA to AIBU and the interaction mattering), and it's totally okay to have the opinion that it's not okay at all. My point was more OP should probably move on, because so many viewpoints are being expressed from the perspective of each person's personal beliefs on the topic, on both sides, with neither side showing any regard for understanding that other perspectives exist. When two completely opposing sides both say \"I'm right you're wrong\", it's kinda tough to move on from there yet everyone involved thinks theyre in the right. And I very much appreciate you not being one of those people, it's also harder to see something wrong with fundamentally disagreeing when people go about expressing their opinion the way you did. Don't be duck lady, it's not healthy.\n\nSide note, I do find it kinda funny, I don't think I saw any \"ESH\" yet duck lady ended up doing basically the same thing to OP, except with seemingly more malicious intent?
