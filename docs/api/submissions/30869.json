They eat, they shit, the water PH goes all nuts in the lake, no water plants, no fish, shore trees die back, water deoxygenates, algae blooms, lake is screwed, beaver is bummed, migratory ducks are in bad shape, people get sad when the city has to addle goose eggs and hire dog teams to harass the excess geese. It turns out it was all down to one older couple who would buy a 50 pound bag of feed grain every week, slash it open and leave it out for the geese.

Why did she walk in front of you if you were recording a video? Its easy to tell when someone is doing that (since you said she walled past) like\u2026 i\u2019m confused about that. If i saw someone recording something and didnt want to be in it, id stop for a sec and wait till they\u2019re done or go around. And like you said, you weren\u2019t recording her specifically.

It\u2019s a totally different thing.", "I would equate it more to people being selfish and wanting their way. Like if I was on a bus drinking coffee and someone sat next to me and said \"Do you mind throwing that away? I hate the smell of coffee\", I would be like \"Hell, no!\" I have a right to drink coffee and they are in public with no expectation of not being near coffee. People can take photos if they want to and shouldn't be coerced by others' wishes and opinions. It's not my responsibility to ask the permission of every person I see in public if they are in the background of a photo I take. \n\nNow if OP was taking a photo of them as the clear subject I do think it would be respectful to ask for permission, but that wasn't the case, she was just briefly in frame of their video.", "Why would he delete a video of this experience that\u2019s nothing to do with her.

You could say she was in the way of his video lol", "I don't know that this comparison is equally weighted. \n\nFlipping the finger and uttering slurs are widely understood as intended to hurt a person's feelings or spirit. \n\nNot so catching a person while filming a video of flocking ducks.", "ok.. in which case there may actually be a negative impact to wildlife with whatever the fuck she's doing, in which case, she probably shouldn't be doing that...??\n\nWhat am I missing?", "This has got to be the worst take on this that I've seen.  If it's illegal and she knows it she should be protected to keep doing it?  Why?", "lol, that's her problem. And she shouldn't be doing it out in public where someone might take a photo.", "This is a morality sub. This isn't \"am I legally clear?\"\n\nMorally speaking most people have decided that making this person the subject of the video when they have asked not to be is morally wrong.", "The OP (and you) are in a sub where the express purpose of the sub is \"Am I the ***Ahole***.\"  Not \"was I technically correct.\"  Not \"was I legal\" but \"was I the ahole.\"  \n\n\nThe sub is for that purpose and no other.  Why is this confusing to you?  \n\n\nWhat you keep trying to defend falls under the heading of \"legal\" or \"technically correct.\"  No one's asking about that.  THAT is why people keep stating \"this sub is not 'is this legal.'\"", "He filmed the ducks because they were following the lady in great numbers. The lady was part of the video.", "I'd say it's ok to record someone, until they express discomfort. The woman asked for the video to be deleted. OP should've done it. OP is an AH for that in my book. YTA.", "I think this is an interesting point.\n\nI'm puzzled, though, because I don't know what's covered by \"bodily autonomy.\"\n\nCan someone clarify?", "That seems to be the case here.", "That's comparing apples and oranges.  Having a stranger point their camera at you is a lot different than a store passively recording (even if that scenario sucks too).", "Fine, don\u2019t address my actual criticism.", "The fact she started taking pictures of him i doubt she would be okay with blurring. She\u2019s likely just petty/grumpy", "Grocery stores are public places, and I expect to be recorded on their security cameras even, but if someone starts following me around Aldi with a camera I\u2019d be speaking to the staff and/or police about stalking.

Unless you became a viral meme for something you did wrong, there really isn\u2019t that much of a bad effect, it\u2019s not like people will stop hiring you or break relationships based off a viral meme, but then again these people claiming they don\u2019t want to become viral is another joke because you don\u2019t become viral for just walking along while there\u2019s a herd of 300 ducks behind you, nobody cares about you they wanna see the ducks, you do become viral for acting all entitled and demanding people to delete the video, which they don\u2019t have to, I honestly feel it would have been like much smoother for both op and the lady if she had asked him respectfully and treated him like a human instead of acting all aggressive, which was probably why even op stood his ground, else usually people who ask nicely usually are met with the same amount of respect and willingness to come to an understanding, I bet if she was nice to op he would\u2019ve deleted it too", "I\u2019m not in America.

It absolutely **does not** make him the AH", "Oh no the terrible horrible memes about a lady that ducks like. Wow how could she ever take that (IF OP were to post it which he already said he never was going to)", "You know what isn\u2019t moral though? Taking videos of human beings without their consent.", "Clearly we disagree. I would never video someone without their consent. I\u2019m frankly concerned that is such a hot take to some people.", "You have already violated her privacy by recording her.", "It's not about just filming a person, is it? It's about that person deciding when and where you're allowed to film in public based on where they happen to be. You don't get to tell other people when they're allowed to take pictures of wildlife just because accidentally being caught on camera in public would make you \"uncomfortable\". If you're being followed and recorded constantly, that's understandable, and it would be annoying. But if someone is trying to record the ducks and you happen to be walking along when they record, then why make a big deal about it?

If it's reasonable to expect privacy, then sure, but this is not that environment. \n\nOP states they were recording the ducks. \n\nI would argue that if any of us saw 300 ducks in one space, we would whip out our phones and take a photo/video.", "Lmao, exactly. \u201cBut what if she was hurting the ducks illegally and didn\u2019t want anyone to know? Wouldn\u2019t be be the AH for filming that then?\u201d", "Morally speaking, no harm is being done then. He didn\u2019t post the picture, and she was **NOT** the subject of the picture. The 300 ducks were. He said that in the post.", "Well. She was out in public", "She liked to video of the ducks. She\u2019s NTA. People who go out in public then complain about having their pictures taken ATA", "Bodily autonomy covers things like you get to decide who cums on or in you, and it's your choice if you get a tattoo.\n\nIt does cover videos and images to a certain extent, but only in private.", "Well she did that after he refused and was trying to get him to understand. But sometimes to be an ethical person you have to delete photos or films. \n\nIf he started out with \"sorry, I'm just filming the ducks you won't be seen\" she might have be satisfied with that. We won't know though because OP went into attack mode.", "You\u2019re correct, OP doesn\u2019t explicitly state where he was at the time of the video, but his statement that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t need permission to video in public\u201d indicates that he lives in a relatively free country. \n\nWhile I do live in the states, my statement is merely a comparison between an activity which is explicitly protected by many governments to prevent/restrict the erosion of rights by totalitarian regimes. One doesn\u2019t need to live in a specific country to have rights that are protected. More germane to the conversation at hand is: exercising one\u2019s rights is rarely an AH move.

Someone filming you will have no context to the person they're filming, and the subject in the video was really the flock of ducks.\n\nI think where we have a difference is that I accept that people can make a request and that the request can be declined politely.  That doesn't make the object of the request an asshole.  The expectation that people in public will follow your requests as though they were orders is what will make you an asshole.\n\nIf people aren't comfortable with being in the background of someone taking pictures, they can quietly skulk away.  If they're really paranoid, they can take steps to obscure their identity.
