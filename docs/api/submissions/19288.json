Despite my petite frame, he deemed my clothing promiscuous and often called me derogatory names. Even when my outfits were appropriate, my father would criticize my tops for appearing indecent due to my larger bust. My father continued criticizing my clothing choices, and my mother (40F) remained passive, occasionally adding her agreement to his comments. \r  \n\r  \nWhile most of this behavior ceased when I turned 18, this night my father burst angrily into my room, shouting, \"Are you a fucking slut?! Do you work at the airport?!\" as he shoved his phone in my face. In the Philippines, the term \"taga airport,\" translated to \"from the airport\" in English, is a derogatory term used to describe sex workers, as many strip clubs are located near airports. When I looked at his phone, I saw that he was referring to my current profile picture on Facebook, which was a mirror selfie of me wearing a string top with a little bit of my cleavage showing. \r  \n\r  \nThe photo that my father showed me was a screenshot sent by his brother (60M). It didn't surprise me because he has always been the one to make negative comments about my pics, especially when there is even a slight hint of cleavage visible. He would consistently urge my father to ask me to change such photos.\r  \n\r  \nHe was fuming mad and kept spouting things like \"Are you fucking brainless?\", \"Why post this kind of picture?\", and \"What will the other family members say when they see this?\" I was confused at first since the picture was pretty decent and it wasn't anything nude, provocative, nor explicit. \r  \n\r  \nMy father insisted that I change my profile picture. I declined, which led to an argument. My mother (40F) also insisted that I should delete and change the pic. I told them no, and said that my profile picture was perfectly fine and there was nothing wrong with it. I told them that since it was my account, they had no authority to demand changes. But, my father said that posting such a picture was a \"life-long humiliation\" for him and that he had lost his will to live because of it. \r  \n\r  \nDuring the argument, a spiteful thought crossed my mind, thus this is where I might be the asshole. I edited my previous picture and added a text overlay that covered my modest display of cleavage, with the word \"censored,\" used it as a profile picture. I accompanied it with a caption saying, \"I hope my entire family is no longer angry since I no longer look like a hooker.\"\r  \n\r  \nMy relatives on my father's side are blowing me up on our family group chat. And his brother, the one who showed the picture to my father, is telling me to remove my profile picture again. I think I took it too far and should've just changed it with a different picture.
