{"id": 19288, "submission_id": "144a6i2", "title": "AITA for changing my profile picture on Facebook when my father called me derogatory terms for my previous one?", "selftext": "During my (19F) teenage years, I faced criticism from my father (65M) for wearing skirts, shorts, and tops with thin straps to cope with the hot climate in the Philippines. Despite my petite frame, he deemed my clothing promiscuous and often called me derogatory names. Even when my outfits were appropriate, my father would criticize my tops for appearing indecent due to my larger bust. My father continued criticizing my clothing choices, and my mother (45F) remained passive, occasionally adding her agreement to his comments.\n\nWhile most of this behavior ceased when I turned 18, this night my father burst angrily into my room, shouting, \"Are you a fucking slut?! Do you work at the airport?!\" as he shoved his phone in my face. In the Philippines, the term \"taga airport,\" translated to \"from the airport\" in English, is a derogatory term used to describe sex workers, as many strip clubs are located near airports. When I looked at his phone, I saw that he was referring to my current profile picture on Facebook, which was a mirror selfie of me wearing a string top with a little bit of my cleavage showing.\n\nThe photo that my father showed me was a screenshot sent by his brother (60M). It didn't surprise me because he has always been the one to make negative comments about my pics, especially when there is even a slight hint of cleavage visible. He would consistently urge my father to ask me to change such photos.\n\nHe was fuming mad and kept spouting things like \"Are you fucking brainless?\", \"Why post this kind of picture?\", and \"What will the other family members say when they see this?\" I was confused at first since the picture was pretty decent and it wasn't anything nude, provocative, nor explicit.\n\nMy father insisted that I change my profile picture. I declined, which led to an argument. My mother also insisted that I should delete and change the pic. I told them no, and said that my profile picture was perfectly fine and there was nothing wrong with it. I told them that since it was my account, they had no authority to demand changes. But, my father said that posting such a picture was a \"life-long humiliation\" for him and that he had lost his will to live because of it.\n\nDuring the argument, a spiteful thought crossed my mind, thus this is where I might be the asshole. I edited my previous picture and added a text overlay that covered my modest display of cleavage, with the word \"censored,\" used it as a profile picture. I accompanied it with a caption saying, \"I hope my entire family is no longer angry since I no longer look like a hooker.\"\n\nMy relatives on my father's side are blowing me up on our family group chat. And his brother, the one who showed the picture to my father, is telling me to remove my profile picture again. I think I took it too far and should've just changed it with a different picture. So reddit AITA?  \n\n\nEDIT: sorry guys I got the age mixed up! My father is 65 and my mom is 45, and my uncle is 60. I only focused on my parents' 20 year gap. My older sister is 25 and I'm turning 20 this year.\n\nAlso to give more info:  \n\n\n1. I will move out on August for my Uni which is located in a different city since we will start having face-to-face classes. Yay!\n2. My mom does nothing about my father's remarks but trust me, my mom is scarier. She's the type to go physical.\n3. My uncle did this before too. One event was when I was wearing a dress for my 18th birthday. The second one is when I changed my profile picture since I was wearing thin strapped dress. And this post is the third one.\n4. My father's side of the family is very religious since we have an Aunt who is a nun. My father has around 12 siblings and most of them are single old people who had never been married.\n5. When I was younger, my rich Aunt would buy me tons of dresses since she adores me so much. My father got angry about it saying I'm not a barbie doll to be dressed up with clothes like that. \n6. Each time I am objectified sexually, my father would hold me responsible for it, claiming that my choice of clothing is the cause. However, I believe my attire is quite modest. The truth is, my physical features, such as my large bust, buttocks, wide hips, thick thighs, small waist, short height, and pale skin, naturally attract attention in our community where pale skin is highly desired. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that my body type should not be a justification for sexual objectification.\n7. Idk if this is also relevant, but when I was conceived, my mother tried to abort me using pills, but it did not work. And my father would say this to me as a joke often. I know it's the truth since my mom never denied it and just avoided the topic.\n8. I was raised by a nanny till 10th grade. Growing up, my parents were never really there for me. After being mistreated by them, the next day they would give me money to coax me and would never say sorry.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1686233020, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144a6i2/aita_for_changing_my_profile_picture_on_facebook/", "score": 1072, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your father is using threats of unaliving himself to control you.  This is not ok.  He is **lying to you** to force your compliance.  Don't fall for it.\n\nYour family should be ashamed. Your father is a misogynist and an abuser.  Can you somehow leave that place ?  Can you find a way to move out, go to school, get away from this toxicity ?

As soon as you get the chance to, run, and never look back, cut off contact with them because unfortunately from experience this abuse would never end.
