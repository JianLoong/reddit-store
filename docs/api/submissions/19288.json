He\u2019s just trying to hide it by conveniently \u201creporting\u201d them to your father. As why else would he be so invested in your profile? None of this is your fault, your family is just full of perverse weirdos. I\u2019d recommend keep messing with them until they eventually become submissive and just realize their words don\u2019t mean anything anymore.", "NTA!!!!!\n\nFrom one Filipina to another, pakialam nila?\n\nAlso, and I think I should've started with this: **No good father will ever talk to his daughter like that and no good father will ever tolerate somebody else talking to him about his daughter in a derogatory and disrespectful manner.** No matter how well-meaning his or their acts might be, that's still disrespect.\n\nYour father and his family are sexualizing you by hiding behind feeling \"shame.\" Then again, it shows that maybe they do find it sexual and they're projecting their shame on you by lashing out at you. In any case, they're all disgusting.\n\nOh yeah, fuck that uncle. What a creep.", "Nta - and you need to start looking for a way to move out. Your family is toxic.", "NTA - I did something similar a long time ago. My profile picture was of the Ghostbusters trapping Jesus. Then facebook opened up to everyone and my wife's family freaked out so I shopped in a big censored bar. It didn't solve anything but it wasn't something that needed fixing in the first place and neither is this.", "NTA, so sorry your own family sexualise you. Terrifying, I hope you\u2019re safe", "Why is your uncle obsessed with your cleavage? That is very distasteful. \n\nWhy are your uncle and father sexualising you? \n\nTry asking them that. How disgusting are they? \n\nNTA", "NTA, your uncle and dad are skeezy old guys, let them die of shame because nothing you do is half as bad as them sexualizing their own niece/daughter, especially when you consider your parents\u2019 age gap. \n\nI would just remove all family from socials. If they\u2019re going to be upset about what you post no matter what, you might as well fully commit and piss them off by blocking them.", "NTA\n\nDon't change the picture. It's perfect.", "OP, they are trying to control you and are comfortable doing so. Please inform your family you are an adult and your decisions are your own. Your uncle probably has some issues to be affected by photos of you. Please unfriend him and anyone else who comments negatively about your appearance.", "NTA, good for you.  Your father is a controlling abuser.", "Unfriend anyone who complains.", "ESH\n\nIf you are still living with your parents, and are relying on them for basic things (like your phone and cell service) then I would change the profile picture to something that is a bit more palatable. Once you leave their house, then it's your life, you can do with it what you want. Trying to assert your independence is all fine and dandy till your Father tells you to give him the phone he pays for and to get out of his house. It might not seem fair, and it might seem old fashioned, and it is, but I get some cultures are very strict, but sometimes you have to pick and choose your battles. You are 19, you live with your parents, you rely on them. This is NOT a battle you want to fight right now.", "NTA. Good for you. Your uncle is creepy. I would leave that group chat though. You don't need to spend energy on people who insult you and call you a hooker.", "Hey, another bot replied to you;  /u/TopPaleontologist15 is a scammer!  **Do not click any links they share or reply to**.  Please downvote their comment and click the `report` button, selecting `Spam` then `Harmful bots`.  \n\nWith enough reports, the reddit algorithm will suspend this scammer.\n\n---\n>!^(If this message seems out of context, it may be because TopPaleontologist15 is copying content to farm karma, and deletes their scam activity when called out - Read the pins on my profile for more information.)!<", "What a ridiculous sexist comment. You think it\u2019s reasonable for dads to have huge fears that their daughters will end up as sex workers? GTFOH with that garbage. Why do you demean all women like this? I can guarantee you that normal parents do not have this very unreasonable fear.", "her response is childish? what\u2019s childish is her shitty abusive father saying he lost his will to live over this. op doesn\u2019t suck in anyway. the creep prev uncle, perv dad and no spine having mom suck.", "And please change\"censored\" to \"sexualized by my family\"", "So, I wonder if he was sexualizing you with the comments ceasing when you turned 18.", "NTA but I'm going to use the insult of asking whether someone works at the airport for the rest of my life. 10/10", "Wow. Triggered much?\n\nShe\u2019s from the Philippines. Massive sex industry. Massive exploitation because they\u2019re poor. That\u2019s why I said maybe he fears it. I would if I was a parent in a country like that. Much as I would fear my daughter starting an onlyfans account in my country. \n\nAnd yeah, I wouldn\u2019t want my daughter to be a sex worker. Sorry if that\u2019s not in line with whatever crazy you identify with", "Her entire family sounds abusive and I think the men are seriously misogynistic. Also, I know it's a cliche to bring up age gaps in this sub, but the fact that her father was 41 and her mother 21 when they had OP, makes me think even more that he's a misogynistic asshole. Was she even an adult when they met?", "Therefore, it\u2019s probably safe to say your mom was a minor by USA reckoning (I don\u2019t know what the law is where you are but that\u2019s still icky) while your dad was late 30s.", "NTA and make your move a permanent one"]}
