It's a two level establishment, with a quiet section upstairs that we're at. I know there was one empty table on the upper level the whole night, but I don't know how busy downstairs was. I've been here before and they've sometimes had a \"help yourself\" water jug and glasses on the bar in the past, though this wasn't the case tonight.\n\nI don't drink, but I ordered an appetizer and water. My appetizer comes in decent time, but then the waiter disappears.\n\nOver an hour later, no water has arrived for me (though two friends who ordered a drink and water had their water arrive). My group hasn't ordered another round in a while and I realize there's no server in sight.\n\nI'm really thirsty by now, so I get up and and look for water. There's a bar upstairs, but the server is nowhere in sight. The whole floor has been left unattended; presumably our server is downstairs.\n\nI assume they're busy and look for a water glass and jug. No dice. But there is the bar tap (no barrier or sign in the way). I go behind the bar and fill up a glass with water. Sit back down, drink it. A few minutes later I've drained my glass and want more water. Still no server in sight, so I go behind the bar again and fill my glass with water.\n\nJust then the server reappears up the stairs, and they are livid when they see me behind the bar. I get a dressing down that it's illegal for a customer to step behind the bar (with the fact that it serves alcohol I probably should have had some inkling, but it didn't occur to me, the non drinker, at the time).\n\nI explain that my water never arrived, and I didn't see her anywhere so I thought to fill my glass up myself. The server says they did in fact serve my water, and points to a friend's water. The friend says it's theirs as the server storms off, making a point of shutting the (previously unseen and unused) half-door thingy into the bar. They avoid my table for the rest of the evening, and when I settle the bill I apologize. I get another dressing down, making the table quite awkward. I know at this point that I did an absolute no-no. I say goodbye to my friends, leave a $10 tip on my $10 appetizer and walk out, not saying anything more to the server.\n\nAm I the asshole here? Did they over-react, or am I lucky I wasn't barred from the establishment? I'd also love to know if the act of a customer stepping behind the bar itself is actually illegal or if it's more of a health code/insurance/don't look like you're trying to steal a drink thing.", "created_utc": 1667289559, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj2hat/aita_for_getting_myself_water_from_behind_the_bar/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You broke a pretty obvious rule. But there was no reason for the server to make a scene and embarrass you in front of your friends, and definitely not twice. She also shouldn\u2019t have ignored you the rest of the night.

It would honestly never occur to me to help myself at a place with wait staff.
