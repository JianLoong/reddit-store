Especially enough to want to make you, his actual friend, lie to him and make yourself look bad?\n\nWhy is it important to her that she looks smarter than you in his eyes?\n\nMakes me think she has a crush or something. Very weird.\n\nAnd her trying to throw you out of the car in the middle of the night so far from home is dangerous and abusive. How the hell did you end up the one in trouble for that?\n\nFor real though, that's technically child endangerment. \n\nI'm sorry your family doesn't have your back on this. They should.", "NTA. Just because she's pregnant doesn't give her the right to be rude. I am sick to death of this whole \"she's pregnant~ she didn't mean it\"/\"it's just hormones~\". Stfu.\n\nIf she was a bitch before she was pregnant, then she'll be a bitch while she's pregnant and for the rest of her life. Maybe just try and keep your distance and don't ask her for any favours or go out of your way to do any for her. She chose pregnancy. She can do it herself.", "NTA. Your SIL is insecure in the extreme. Her bizarre lie makes no sense -- maybe it was an attempt at humor? Kicking you out of the car over this is not excusable due to \"pregnancy hormones.\" Kicking you out of the car was cruel and vicious retaliation for a perceived slight. Your family is treating you incredibly poorly. I'm shocked that they grounded you over this, and wonder if I am missing some cultural element of speaking Serbian in your community that would make their behavior seem at least somewhat rational.", "NTA she actually tried to embarrass you in front of your friend. Pregnant or not she\u2019s the AH", "you\u2019re SIL tried and failed to embarrass YOU any telling your friend that you only learned Serbian so you could talk to him, you corrected her and she got butt hurt. NTA\n\nI am totally unclear on why everyone else is freezing you out. When she has treated you like this before have you said anything? Does your family always let it slide or are they waking on eggshells around her simply bc she\u2019s pregnant?", "NTA\u2026 you didn\u2019t do anything wrong\u2026 this is the problem: clearly her joke didn\u2019t land but she didn\u2019t realize and got offended when you didn\u2019t play along with something you didn\u2019t realize you were supposed to\u2026", "NTA you only spoke the truth, SIL got embarrassed and has somehow made this your fault. She sounds pretty awful tbh, and pregnancy hormones are not an excuse to bend the truth. Also, she tried to embarrass you in front of your friend and it didn't work. Your family all sound a bit shit, sorry to say.", "NTA - being pregnant is not an excuse for stupid behaviour.", "NTA your sis in law is a btch and you cannot blame pregnancy hormones on this one. she went straight in to humiliate you and was upset when things didn't go her way. Have you ever done anything to make her dislike you?", "NTA \n\n*she laughed and said to him that I didn't actually know Serbian before I met him and only learned to show off. I reminded her that Serbian is my second language* \n\nShe tried to put you down and embarrass you in front of your friend - and it was a stupid attempt because he would know you were fluent in Serbian. \n\n*sil said that I was being bitchy for embarrassing her infront of my friend and that I could've played along, she then asked for me to tell him that I was kidding and she was right (I said no obviously).*\n\nSo it's fine for her to embarrass you, but when you tell the truth it's not fine, because you are embarrassing her. \n\n*she pulled over and yelled at me to get out and walk (it was pitch black out and walking would take like 45 minutes) and wouldn't stop yelling until I said I'd call my brother.*\n\nShe was prepared to put you in danger when she had a responsibility to get you home safely. \n\nIf everyone thinks you are in the wrong, she hasn't told the story the way you told it. Talk to your mother again and explain again what happened. She acted inappropriately. Refuse to get lifts with her again.", "NTA. Your SIL tried to embarrass you, and you stood up for yourself, so she decided to turn the tables and play victim. Your family is enabling her shitty behavior.\n\nFor you brother's sake, i hope it was pregnant hormones causing her to act like that (not that that is an excuse of course), because the alternative is he married a vindictive, manipulative gaslighter.", "Nta.

Why does she care what a child thinks of her? She wanted you to lie to your friend? And your parents defending her? What is going on here? Why do your parents supper this behavior.

Tell them if they think it's fine then let's see how cps feels about it, especially if she does it to her own child smh. And I'm not daying actually call, but if it may get through their heads they nessed up.", "NTA. You were just speaking the truth. Idk why your SIL cares so much about your friend thinking that she was right, and she is a huge asshole for trying to kick you out of the car over it.\n\nHowever, your parents are right, sometimes you do have to learn to let things go. Your SIL was acting unhinged and you were at her mercy. It would have cost only pride to say \"yes SIL, I will tell them\" and then laugh about it with your friend later. It's not fair that you should have to, but it is easier than fighting a battle that your SIL will always win because she is an adult and you are a minor.", "NTA, but it also sounds like there's some insecurities there that you unknowingly picked at, like that she feels left out of your & your brother's side of the family occasionally because she doesn't speak Serbian?

Still, kicking her out of the car in the dark, miles away from home, is not an acceptable, adult response to a bratty child. Hormones or no, that crossed a safety line. But you are probably right -- she was grounded for escalating the argument, instead of letting it go. Her parents can't discipline their immature daughter-in-law, but they can attempt to guide OP into being a decent person.", "Yeah this is absolutely it. The Sister in Law made a poor and insensitive joke (and hormones don't excuse that), but just taking issue with it wouldn't be enough for OP to get grounded.", "Verovatno ne pri\u010da \u010dim ne kapira da op te\u010dno pri\u010da, ne vidim kako bi druga\u010dije izvalila takvu bedasto\u0107u", "Agreed - I did say that. But at the end of the day she was doing the kid a favour - I think there is no reason to ground for defending themselves but there would be for a stinking attitude and them acting like a brat. They\u2019ve learned a lesson in keeping their mouth shut if they want someone to do a favour for them", "No one gets grounded for \u2018humbly\u2019 defending themselves - quite likely they did it with a bratty attitude. \n\nEither way the SIL was doing them a favour - they don\u2019t have to put up with her but in doing so they can\u2019t expect her to run them around - life doesn\u2019t work like that. The kid won\u2019t be getting any more lifts, even after the grounding is ended. \n\nSometimes you just have to bite your lip to get what you want. It\u2019s not being weak, it\u2019s being smart", "They\u2019re 15 and 16 - that\u2019s not an age where you \u2018need\u2019 to be picked up. They could have got public transport or called another relative to retrieve them. It\u2019s not unreasonable to give a teen of that age consequences for their attitude (I didn\u2019t miss them being bratty - I mentioned attitude in my first sentence)", "But they weren\u2019t acting like a brat. They corrected her when she tried to embarrass them. She then wanted them to text their friends and repeat her attempt at humiliation. I\u2019d be getting a bit of an \u201cattitude\u201d at this point. If they payment for someone doing you a favour is having to debase yourself for their whims it\u2019s not a favour.", "In my area, public transportation is not an option, and from the post, it seems like SIL was planning to drive off, leaving the 15-year-old girl on the side of the road in the dark.\n\nYou misunderstood my comment (or I wasn't clear). What I meant was that I missed the bratty element and that YOUR post made me consider that element. It was intended as an acknowledgment that your comment made me see the situation differently.\n\nI don't think leaving anyone on the side of the road 45 minutes from home at night are acceptable consequences for even a pitched screaming match. I might pull over on the side and say I won't drive until the other person stops talking. I might tell the girl that I'd never drive her anyplace again, or might go inside and tell the parents what she did, but I would not abandon someone in the dark like that.", "Ah I understand now - blonde moment!\n\nI must be an AH as I\u2019ve done the leaving by the side of the road as a consequence. Admittedly I did drive round the block and then scoop but left it long enough to make them panic. No one disrespects me in my car when I am doing them a favour ;)", "Ha! Mama don't play ;)"]}
