It's very unlikely that a museum will want a donated copy of the photograph. Museums have limited space and committing to store copies for perpetuity is irresponsible\n\n2. Museums sell or dispose of things only in cases when the piece no longer fits the collection. This is rare and when it does happen, it goes through a rigorous review process and it has to be publicized. If you want to avoid this, have them commit in writing to return the piece to you if they want to remove it. It's unlikely they would agree to this but it would cover your bases. \n\nMy suggestion is to offer the piece as a loan to the museum and have it returned to you when the exhibition comes down. Take good photos of the photograph before you send it and ask the museum to take high resolution images of the front and back of it for you once they get it. Have that written into the loan agreement. You can share the high resolution images with your family to do with as they please.\n\nYou can tell the museum you're interested in donating the piece in the future but you're not ready to do so at this time.

I suspect they would be more interested in the subject matter than whether or not they have the original photo.\n\nDuring WWII, my mother was a young girl growing up in England and had a few stories about meeting American soldiers here.  She told me about various pamphlets that were given to American soldiers while in the UK.  One of these pamphlets told GIs that they were not to respond to seeing black GIs with white British women, as Britain did not have the same cultural issues/taboos as the USA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy don't they want it to be in an exhibition? Are they racist?", "Do you have the resources and knowledge to preserve the photo print properly? Is it mounted on acid-free paper without any damaging glue? If you do not have any background in preservation, please consult with the museum and their preservation folks. You would certainly be able to retain a very high quality copy of the image while leaving the precious item itself in the hands of people who can care for it so that it maximizes its longevity. \n\nDo you have possession of the negative? That is the really valuable and priceless thing in this story, but of course it may be long gone.", "There is a photo of my grandfather in his army uniform and two of my relatives are fighting over the original photo. It's been scanned and emailed to all family after his funeral but these two are insisting on the original. People are weird!", "A lot of museums also have items in storage. So that photo may be on display for 3 months and then simply go in the basement.", "And if anyone in your family knows the story, you should pitch it to [Story Corps](https://storycorps.org/). WWII servicemen and vets are a huge part of the lesser known history of the American Civil Rights Movement.", "Yes, but would be much safer in that basement, overseen by an archivist, than it ever would be at someone's home. Plus, it would then be available to researchers in the future if they wanted access to it. At home, it could just as easily be tossed by an unaware descendant who didn't realize what they were looking at when cleaning out someone's home. Pictures get tossed ALL the time. As a history person, it makes me cringe.", "the museum will probably know how/where he can get good reproductions made", "There is literally not so much as a single word in the post to suggest that the family has been wanting to sell and cash in on the photograph, but go off", "Did I say that my response was about the family? I was clarifying Specialist-Leek-6927's comment to Solk512, who asked why some people are more interested on the value of the photo than the photo itself. In no shape or form did I imply that I actually believe the family members believe that way.", "Well they actually didn\u2019t ask that, they just said \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nCould have just as easily meant \u201cwhy do you suspect that, given there is nothing to indicate it is the case?\u201d\n\nAnd you needed to jump in and back up their initial argument with a reason why they\u2019d want to sell it (again, which was never indicated). Anyway, this is too dumb to continue talking about. Good day"]}
