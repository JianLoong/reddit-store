That way you and your family maintain ownership but they are able to display and profit from.", "NTA.\n\nI would definitely have the photo replicated, but seems a wonderful piece of history especially to document the racism of the times", "Are they upset because they don't want the photo shared with the public or because you'd be giving away the only copy?", "I don't think you're an asshole, but you could loan it to the museum and then put in your will that it will go to them when you die. Or give them a 200 year loan or something of the sort. That way you can say to your family it's on loan, which is technically true, so you don't have to hear the whining.

Those may include preserving that heritage of information. Doing so by giving it to a museum, with the backstory of course, seems entirely appropriate.", "NTA.  And, holy crap, great story.  I would definitely make a really good copy first.", "NTA. The bottom line, is that it\u2019s your photo. You can do whatever you want with it. And the fact of the matter is, you are sharing this for the greater public good. What else would you be doing with it?  In other words; if you kept it, how often would your family see it anyway?", "I like the idea of loaning it to them and getting copies.  I also think that such a precious heirloom would be better cared for and preserved by a museum than in someone's house. NTA", "NTA. However, why not make prints of the original and gift them to everyone who is upset? The museum can care for the original far better and can ensure it is preserved for posterity.  And you and your family can enjoy copies that have the same story. Perhaps even include a copy of the story here so that it can be kept with the photo and not lost to time, generations, and changes due to oral storytelling. Maybe a nice frame?", "Info: have you considered giving the photo to the museum on loan?  it could remain in their possession for a fixed time period.
