Or give them a 200 year loan or something of the sort. That way you can say to your family it's on loan, which is technically true, so you don't have to hear the whining.

Getting the picture put in a museum is a great way for his memory to be honored.", "NTA, and donate away! \n\nSeriously, if your grandfather left it to you, he did so for reasons that only he (and perhaps you) know. Those may include preserving that heritage of information. Doing so by giving it to a museum, with the backstory of course, seems entirely appropriate.", "NTA.  And, holy crap, great story.  I would definitely make a really good copy first.", "NTA. The bottom line, is that it\u2019s your photo. You can do whatever you want with it. And the fact of the matter is, you are sharing this for the greater public good. What else would you be doing with it?  In other words; if you kept it, how often would your family see it anyway?", "I like the idea of loaning it to them and getting copies.  I also think that such a precious heirloom would be better cared for and preserved by a museum than in someone's house. NTA", "NTA. However, why not make prints of the original and gift them to everyone who is upset? The museum can care for the original far better and can ensure it is preserved for posterity.  And you and your family can enjoy copies that have the same story. Perhaps even include a copy of the story here so that it can be kept with the photo and not lost to time, generations, and changes due to oral storytelling. Maybe a nice frame?", "Info: have you considered giving the photo to the museum on loan?  it could remain in their possession for a fixed time period.

As for the people suggesting making copies, that\u2019s not a bad idea. But I would suggest loaning the original if it\u2019s a reputable museum. Museum staff have the resources and knowledge  to preserve it more expertly and they take the insurance burden while it\u2019s in their possession (usually). It\u2019ll have a better chance of surviving longer in a museum than a private home if a natural or man made disaster were to happen.

If you do donate the original as part of the donation request a high res-tiff of the image for your family. I wouldn\u2019t necissarily go the donation route. Photographs should only be displayed for a limited amount of time. If the museum has the loan but keeps it up for more the 6 months it could be significant light damage to the photo.

I think you should give it to the museum on loan and just continually renew the loan, that way you can keep that photo within the family so that no matter what happens to that museum you retain the ability to tell your grandfathers stories.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThink ahead a few decades, museums and small foundations go bankrupt all the time, do you want that photo of your grandpa seized by some banker who then auctions it off to pay out some shareholder who wants a second Ferrari?", "This!

Totally normal.", "I was wondering this too because if it\u2019s the latter I don\u2019t get why they can\u2019t make a duplicate, unless it\u2019s in really fragile condition.
