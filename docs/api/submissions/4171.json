However, there seems to be a slight issue he has (always had?) that he only now mentioned.\n\nI was raised trilingual, and I learned English later in life as well, so technically I speak four languages with English being my weakest so apologies for any mistakes. Because of that, my book collection is rather diverse, including books in all four\u2019languages. If I can, I prefer to read the book in a language it was originally written in and only reach for translations if I don\u2019t speak the language. \nThis has never been a problem and David never mentioned anything about this until now.\n\nHe was helping me unpack the books and I had noticed that he put all non-English books in a separate pile. I asked him about that and he said we didn\u2019t need them and to throw them away. \nI said that you never throw books away, you donate them instead but I didn\u2019t plan on getting rid off any of my books.\n\nHe argued that it was pointless to keep books not in English as they only take up space and they\u2019re only for show and no one but me even reads them.\n\nI told him \u201cr hey\u2019re my books, I could consider downsizing my collection if it was a space issue but since we have the space and they\u2019re in my office, I am not getting rid off them.\u201d\n\nHe got really annoyed so I told him that I didn\u2019t need his help anymore.\n\nYesterday, I went for a coffee with a friend and when I got back home, I found my book shelves to be mostly empty with some candles and figurines placed where my books used to be.\n\nI asked David where my books were and he told me it was a surprise and I came back home to early. His mother came over and help him get rid of all my \u2018useless\u2019 books. The bagged them up, put it in his car and he was about to take them to the skip. I was absolutely furious and he told me I could always replace them with books in English.\n\nI grabbed all my books and went to my office. I installed a lock to my office door so he can\u2019t throw them away but I am so very confused about all of this. To top this off, his sisters called me, one of them screaming her head off because I am an inconsiderate c-word and to get off my high horse and to stop pretending I am better than everyone else. Am I the asshole here? Am I really wrong about not wanting to get rid off my books?", "created_utc": 1670427088, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zf3ysc/aita_because_i_dont_want_to_throw_away_my_books/", "score": 1325, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because of that, my book collection is rather diverse, including books in all four\u2019languages. If I can, I prefer to read the book in a language it was originally written in and only reach for translations if I don\u2019t speak the language. \nThis has never been a problem and David never mentioned anything about this until now.\n\nHe was helping me unpack the books and I had noticed that he put all non-English books in a separate pile. I asked him about that and he said we didn\u2019t need them and to throw them away. \nI said that you never throw books away, you donate them instead but I didn\u2019t plan on getting rid off any of my books.\n\nHe argued that it was pointless to keep books not in English as they only take up space and they\u2019re only for show and no one but me even reads them.\n\nI told him \u201cr hey\u2019re my books, I could consider downsizing my collection if it was a space issue but since we have the space and they\u2019re in my office, I am not getting rid off them.\u201d\n\nHe got really annoyed so I told him that I didn\u2019t need his help anymore.\n\nYesterday, I went for a coffee with a friend and when I got back home, I found my book shelves to be mostly empty with some candles and figurines placed where my books used to be.\n\nI asked David where my books were and he told me it was a surprise and I came back home to early. His mother came over and help him get rid of all my \u2018useless\u2019 books. The bagged them up, put it in his car and he was about to take them to the skip. I was absolutely furious and he told me I could always replace them with books in English.\n\nI grabbed all my books and went to my office. I installed a lock to my office door so he can\u2019t throw them away but I am so very confused about all of this. To top this off, his sisters called me, one of them screaming her head off because I am an inconsiderate c-word and to get off my high horse and to stop pretending I am better than everyone else. Am I the asshole here? Am I really wrong about not wanting to get rid off my books?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He will doubtless continue to try and drag OP down for the sin of being smarter than him.", "This. If something thinks intellectual pursuits are \u201csomeone trying to show off/be better then others\u201d they\u2019re an insecure asshole. NTA at all OP.", "It\u2019s not stupid or immature- stupid and immature is something a teenager might do. This is a grown man (and his grown mother and sister!!) and it\u2019s a HUGE act of very deliberate disrespect. The (hopefully soon ex-) boyfriend should be proud of OP for her language skills! And as a bare minimum he should respect her belongings and interests even though he doesn\u2019t understand them himself. And the sister yelling at OP, calling her names, is the icing on the cake. OP - do NOT doubt yourself!!! NTA * 1000. Your (ex)boyfriend and family are hijos de puta completos! S\u00e1lvate mientras puedas!", "\"I threw out all your bras. They're pointless, as you're the only one who uses them.\"", "No question!", "Great username, btw.", "I'd do the same thing to him because I'm petty. Wait until he's away for a couple days and get out!\n\nNTA.", "> Clearly he is intimidated by the fact that you speak multiple languages. \"Nobody reads them but [you]\" -- well yeah! They're your books! Who else would be reading them?\n\nThe fact that OP reads her own books is enough. But does he not imagine that there are other people who speak those languages. Is English the only language?? NTA", "Oh man I'd love to see this. Yea my husband was so great, I got really sick and he was always by my side, he's always kind and considerate. He always helps around the house and works hard to help make sure we can have a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nSo why are you divorcing him?\n\nOh he dog-eared a book.", "> I would dump a guy for dog-earing pages\n\nI haven't dumped by best friend, but I don't lend him books.  He can (and does) dog-ear his own.", "OP says English is her weakest language.\n\nWhich means the boyfriend was prepared to destroy all the books in her ***native*** language! \n\nThat is disrespectful, not only of her books and her joy of reading, but also of her native culture and language.  \n\nIf they stay together, how is the boyfriend going to deal with her family, not all of whom may be fluent in English, or speak it at all?  \n\nThe targeting of non-English books owned by someone who isn't a native English speaker has even more red flags than just targeting her personal library.", "Plus he sicced his mother and sister on OP?\n\nOP please reevaluate this relationship. \n\nNTA", "At the very least controlling and xenophobic.", "And the  whole family", "Plus the comment from the sister about pretending she\u2019s better than everyone. It\u2019s raining marinara flags.", "What\u2019s their races?", "So many red flags! And yes racist!\n\nYou are NTA. He is very much T A H!", "Il est drapeau rouge. \n\nThis will pivot to it being unacceptable for her to use her childhood languages with family and friends, she will be forbidden from raising kids with any language that he doesn\u2019t understand, etc etc.\n\nNTA", "Oh, and the guy who hated that his girl dressed like Mrs frizzle! Aita has shown me so many flavors of AH to avoid", "Or hook up with a partner as dumb as he is.", ">why are you divorcing him?\n\n>Oh he dog-eared a book.\n\nI am totally behind this person for this. Literally any flat, dry thing will keep your place.", ">OP says English is her weakest language.  \n>  \n>Which means the boyfriend was prepared to destroy all the books in her native language!\n\ngreat catch", "Just wait until there's kids and he won't allow a language other than English.", "His fix is apparently to  dumb down her life to his levels.", "Exactly. There are a few red flags here not just throwing books away.\n\n1. Obviously, throwing op's property when she specifically said NO\n2. Controlling behaviour, again, obviously \n3. Targeting other languages other than his, very common trait among racist\n4. Threatened by his partner's ability/talent/knowledge to a point he has to violat the partner's wish\n5. Based on above, he's also likely sexiest as he can't stand his girlfriend being the smarter one. Further proof is him keeping the language op is least familiar with, in order to feel superior.\n6. Crazy family \n\nKick him out op, and ive never told people to break up before", "This is it. This is absolutely his insecurity and instead of being a normal, well-adjusted human this asshole wants to limit his smart multilingual gf. \n\nIf he were smart and well-adjusted, he would download Duolingo and start learning.\n\nInstead he whines to his mommy and sister and tries to throw away the offended multilingual books.", "yuuuuup", "Xenophobic, racist, controlling A-hole. OP, take your books and run.", "I thought of him but didn\u2019t include that train wreck because he didn\u2019t steal/throw away anything. But he\u2019s up there with these assholes. I hope these women are thriving and enjoying their jars, socks, and dresses.", "\"What are you doing with my gym kit?!?\"\n\n\"Throwing it out. It's useless, it's only for show, and I'd say only you use it but...\"", "I'm sorry, I wasn't clear. As written, your judgement will count as OP being the AH. If you believe otherwise, put a space between the letters - like Y T A - which indicates that's not really how you judge her. If you want to vote OP as NOT the AH, you should include N T A (without spaces) in your comment.\n\nLike this: NTA.", "Also, the MIL! If she is his minion, that is not going to be a good family dynamic later.", "I'm going to add specifically to number 6 that BF clearly invited his crazy family to become flying monkeys in his shenanigans and that's much worse than casual crazy family.", "I think it would be better to classify his behavior as xenophobic rather than racist. Racism is based on the perception of 'races' of humans, while xenophobia is based on culture, country and language.\n\nBut yes, OP is NTA and bf has all the red flags of a Chinese military parade.", "Future OP posts of they don\u2019t break up:\n\n\u2022 AITA for talking to my friend on the phone in a language my bf doesn\u2019t understand bc friend can\u2019t speak English?\n\n\u2022 AITA for wanting to teach my children other languages?\n\n\u2022 AITA for watching foreign language shows even if the English subtitles are on bc bf doesn\u2019t like it?\n\n\u2022 AITA for greeting my friends in our language and alienating my bf even though we all spoke English the rest of the time?\n\n\u2022 AITA for reminding bf that English is my fourth language after he made fun of incorrect grammar?\n\nEtc\n\nThe insecurity and audacity of this man\n\nAs a book collector myself I\u2019m livid as well", "True! I mainly included him because of the way he puts down what she enjoys like the others.", "What made the Mrs Frizzle story great was how the BF\u2019s own mother told him off for his attitude."]}
