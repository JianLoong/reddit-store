However, there seems to be a slight issue he has (always had?) that he only now mentioned.\n\nI was raised trilingual, and I learned English later in life as well, so technically I speak four languages with English being my weakest so apologies for any mistakes. Because of that, my book collection is rather diverse, including books in all four\u2019languages. If I can, I prefer to read the book in a language it was originally written in and only reach for translations if I don\u2019t speak the language. \nThis has never been a problem and David never mentioned anything about this until now.\n\nHe was helping me unpack the books and I had noticed that he put all non-English books in a separate pile. I asked him about that and he said we didn\u2019t need them and to throw them away. \nI said that you never throw books away, you donate them instead but I didn\u2019t plan on getting rid off any of my books.\n\nHe argued that it was pointless to keep books not in English as they only take up space and they\u2019re only for show and no one but me even reads them.\n\nI told him \u201cr hey\u2019re my books, I could consider downsizing my collection if it was a space issue but since we have the space and they\u2019re in my office, I am not getting rid off them.\u201d\n\nHe got really annoyed so I told him that I didn\u2019t need his help anymore.\n\nYesterday, I went for a coffee with a friend and when I got back home, I found my book shelves to be mostly empty with some candles and figurines placed where my books used to be.\n\nI asked David where my books were and he told me it was a surprise and I came back home to early. His mother came over and help him get rid of all my \u2018useless\u2019 books. The bagged them up, put it in his car and he was about to take them to the skip. I was absolutely furious and he told me I could always replace them with books in English.\n\nI grabbed all my books and went to my office. I installed a lock to my office door so he can\u2019t throw them away but I am so very confused about all of this. To top this off, his sisters called me, one of them screaming her head off because I am an inconsiderate c-word and to get off my high horse and to stop pretending I am better than everyone else. Am I the asshole here? Am I really wrong about not wanting to get rid off my books?", "created_utc": 1670427088, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zf3ysc/aita_because_i_dont_want_to_throw_away_my_books/", "score": 219, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because of that, my book collection is rather diverse, including books in all four\u2019languages. If I can, I prefer to read the book in a language it was originally written in and only reach for translations if I don\u2019t speak the language. \nThis has never been a problem and David never mentioned anything about this until now.\n\nHe was helping me unpack the books and I had noticed that he put all non-English books in a separate pile. I asked him about that and he said we didn\u2019t need them and to throw them away. \nI said that you never throw books away, you donate them instead but I didn\u2019t plan on getting rid off any of my books.\n\nHe argued that it was pointless to keep books not in English as they only take up space and they\u2019re only for show and no one but me even reads them.\n\nI told him \u201cr hey\u2019re my books, I could consider downsizing my collection if it was a space issue but since we have the space and they\u2019re in my office, I am not getting rid off them.\u201d\n\nHe got really annoyed so I told him that I didn\u2019t need his help anymore.\n\nYesterday, I went for a coffee with a friend and when I got back home, I found my book shelves to be mostly empty with some candles and figurines placed where my books used to be.\n\nI asked David where my books were and he told me it was a surprise and I came back home to early. His mother came over and help him get rid of all my \u2018useless\u2019 books. The bagged them up, put it in his car and he was about to take them to the skip. I was absolutely furious and he told me I could always replace them with books in English.\n\nI grabbed all my books and went to my office. I installed a lock to my office door so he can\u2019t throw them away but I am so very confused about all of this. To top this off, his sisters called me, one of them screaming her head off because I am an inconsiderate c-word and to get off my high horse and to stop pretending I am better than everyone else. Am I the asshole here? Am I really wrong about not wanting to get rid off my books?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He\u2019s only going to pull more of this twattery if OP stays with him and he actually got his mummy involved too?! What a massive AH.", "This! Girl I would thank him for boxing your books back up again and just move out now.\n\nIt is alarming that he was trying to throw OP's possessions away after *specifically* having a conversation about wanting to keep them (and they're clearly personally valuable). He should want to support and celebrate his gf's passions and interests, not get rid of them. That response from his sisters is also incredibly disproportionate \ud83d\udea9 How is it \"inconsiderate\" to keep your own books in your own office. Because he can't read them too? Funnily enough there's a solution to that: learning. And how are books useless if the owner of said books can read them? What a nonsensically bullshit excuse. Being able to speak four languages is amazing and something to be proud of!\n\nAlso his focus on getting rid of only the non-English books is incredibly off. It comes off as xenophobic (or racist). OP, he is invalidating the diversity of your family & cultural background, which is a part of you. What a horrible little man.

Run.", "This boy does not know how to say red flag in enough languages. Just walk away.", "also super racist that he only wants to rid the non-english books!\n\nop, take it from a librarian of ten years.... run\n\nNTA", "If she stays they're going to make her life a real nightmare. The bf is being controlling, disrespectful and probably abusive and it's going to escalate soon to another level, so she's needs to leave now while she has a chance.", "Can you imagine his reaction when she starts teaching their kid one of those nasty non-English languages?", "Yeah I thought clicking in that this would be a clutter issue but it's definitely not, he even said that if she wants those books she can buy them in English!", ">The only one reading your books being you is a problem because...?\n\nBecause he has an inferiority complex and heaven forbid he has to feel that way in his own house.\n\nHe clearly doesn't want reminders she can do things he can't.\n\nNo wonder he went to Mummy.", "Let\u2019s add this guy to the mason jar boyfriend and the cool socks boyfriend. They\u2019re all about control. Fuck them.", "Yeah OP literally has red flags flapping her in the face and she's wondering If she's the ah...SMH", "Typically people posting on this sub are not in healthy relationships.  The normal relationships that post on here is atypical.", "He needs to live alone if he can't deal with this.", "He said they were just for show because she's the only one that would read them.\n\nHe needs to live alone if that's his idea of how things work. He can't seriously think that someone will be happy sharing a house with him if they are only allowed to have things he's interested in?", "\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", "And a screaming sister?\n\nI would calmly ask her what exactly she had been told about the issue and why she thinks it's a problem that I had my own interests separate to her brother.\n\nBetting boyfriend won't give up his hobbies if she isn't interested in them.", "By his logic all her clothes are useless.\n\nThey're 'just for show' and she's the only one that uses them.", "The very first moment she leaves the office unlocked the books will be gone for good.", "Because disrespectful people, like the kind who try not once but twice to get rid of their partners belongings, tend to be in the company of other disrespectful people.  What about that makes this story unbelievable?", "You might want to space out your judgement if you're being sarcastic. And I sincerely hope you are.", "And yeah, NTA. Not even slightly.", "I\u2019m thinking insecure that he only knows one language and threatened that girlfriend is smarter.\n\nEdit: being raised trilingual was luck, but teaching herself English took intelligence", "In Portuguese you can say \"sinal de alerta\" that pretty much means the same. The literal words are \"bandeira vermelha\". =)", "He will always come back to his mommy, for sure.", "Very true. OP should start getting rid of anything that\u2019s only for the use of her boyfriend.", "Pretty much everything. You're quadrilingual and ONLY now learn your partner hates other languages in their home? Their parent ALSO strongly feels this way and helps them dispose of YOUR things. This all comes about in less than a day? His sisters are now harrassing the OP by text over the issue? \n\nNone of this is believable. It's also the classic format of all the fake posts on here.", "Obviously sarcastic. \nWhat do you mean \u201cspace out\u201d?", "Except moving in together, like engagement and marriage, are one of the big changes that cause an abusive partner to reveal their true selves. An abusive man being enmeshed with his mother is also typical and practically expected.", "LOL ok believe what you want to. I just don't think someone intelligent enough to be THAT proficient in their worst language would have a partner dumb enough to expect them to NOT have books in their OWN native language.", "I never claimed to believe or not believe. I don't expect controlling people to make smart decisions, irrationality goes hand in hand with  that behavior. I think calling her partner dumb severely underestimates those kind of people. People date opposites all the time. She may not have realized just how opposite due to masking. \n\n\nIt could very well be fake, but I don't understand how it isn't a realistic scenario.", "Perhaps but if you are with someone who wants to throw out your prize possessions, who is in denial of your identity fundamentally, then yeah don't be with them\n\nI just don't believe the post. It's following the format to the letter of half of the posts that just sound fake upon fake so unless someone makes it believable at all i don't feel the need to take it seriously"]}
