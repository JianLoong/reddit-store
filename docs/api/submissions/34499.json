People like your mom make the lives of neurodivergent people (like me) so much harder.\n\nIt's one thing to use sarcasm or hyperbole but flat out lying about her preference is such an asshole move.\n\nWe've been having a similar issue at our house recently.  My SO leaves dirty dishes in the sink and dirty pots and pans on the stove. I tell her that if she can't or doesn't want to wash them right away to just tell me and I'll do it *I mean it.*\n\nI mean for her to say, \"hey, I left a pot on the stove and a plate in the sink. Wash it for me?\" and I'll go \"Okay.\" And *that's THAT.* \n\nShe's handed the task off to me, gets confirmation that I've heard, and then she can go the fuck off on her merry way.\n\nBut because of people like your MOTHER *nobody believes me when I say that this is what I want.*\n\nThey think it's a trap. Or I'm being passive aggressive.  Or I'm trying to pull some woe is me bullshit when really all I am saying is I WILL WASH THE FUCKING DISH IF YOU LET ME KNOW YOU PUT IT THERE. I am WILLING. \n\nIt doesn't matter to me if you simply DON'T WANT to wash the fucking dish. I don't care about the reason! I don't care who does the task! I will do it 100% of the time, every time. JUST LET ME KNOWWWWW.\n\nMy SO is usually pretty good about listening to the words that I say without assigning some arbitrary hidden agenda or motive, but for some reason this particular issue is an ongoing problem. \n\nI'd also like to point out that for all the ways NT people tend to see their methods of communication as superior, it sure seems like you all spend a fuckton on therapy trying to figure out how to use your words to say what you mean rather than the exact opposite.", "NTA. Don't apologize and as soon ad you're rehabbed from ACL you need to move even if you're renting a shoebox", "NTA. I've been there, ACL tears are indeed excruciating (though I wonder if you have additional injuries to the knee since even presurgery I could walk on mine), and please, get your surgeon to get on your insurance's ass about surgery, or get a new surgeon.", "With any luck I'll be able to get back to DoorDash with the help of a friend soon. They've offered to come along with me and do the walking parts of the job as long as I do the driving parts.", "I have to fight to get any help at all. Even when she could help, she'd rather pass it on to her dad who has trouble with stairs after a knee replacement surgery. It's really only a matter of time until he falls down them, especially because they downright refused to put railings on the stairs to my room (something I am currently struggling with because of my knee, I've fallen down them three times since hurting myself and have gotten zero sympathy from her). I feel like you're right, there's no way she didn't know I had just gotten up to my room before texting me.\n\nShe won't even help my dad unless she physically has to, so I don't honestly know what I expected. She'd rather sit on her ass all day on Facebook and buy countless bits of clothes she wears once and then puts in storage. Not a day goes by where she isn't getting some stupid package from one of her friends in an MLM scheme.", "I don't have much of another choice, or I would just stay downstairs full-time. Sleeping on the floor or in my wheelchair would be the only other things available to me, since my father is sleeping downstairs and has been since 2017, when he was first confined to his wheelchair. Growing up she would refuse to even take me to the doctor until the school threatened her with CPS, and then her tone immediately changed to \"oh my poor sweet baby, why didn't you tell me sooner you were hurt\". A few years back she let me suffer with an infected gallbladder until it nearly needed emergency surgery because she just can't be fucking bothered to help me with anything.", "I'm in the middle of trade school with nowhere to go. They were going to rent my paternal grandmother's house to me when she passed away, but swiveled on a dime and essentially gifted it to my younger brother instead when he turned 18.", "On a good day, I can sort of hobble if I use crutches. Like I said though, today *sucked* for it, my knee buckled twice earlier today and once like fifteen minutes after I made the post. I'm sure a big part of it is that I'm overweight, and I know that I am, but I'm on the road to losing it so hopefully that'll help if this ever happens again (here's hoping it doesn't).

Is there no way you can visit a doctor and let your leg be seen to?\n\n I had an ACL tear in my knee  just before the first lockdown, and got a soft cast for seven days, then an MRI and then I just got a knee splint for about 6 weeks. My doctor said unless the leg heals completely crooked, surgery is no longer recommended. I don't live in a country with insurances you have to argue with in emergency cases, but I can't imagine something like that is not covered. \n\nI slept with my leg up on a thick pillow and was kind to myself in general, but I walked my kid to school and did house and desk work no problem. No crawling around on the floor. Because of the lockdowns I then started to do exercises from YouTube and I am perfectly fine now. You can even buy these splints first or secondhand online, just by the circumference of your leg or body weight. You certainly shouldn't be vending your knee, it causes repeated injury and it needs to not move to heal and when it's healed, it will be stiff at first, but massages and gentle exercises will make it soft again.\n\nI don't know if your mother is involved in the treatment of your leg or with the insurance, but if she is, please take it into your own hands. Wish I could just send you my splint, it cost 35 Euros here and it might just fit.", "You are a grown man, live at home with your parents, seemingly eat the dinner they provide on a regular basis, and admittedly, the only thing you do to help regularly is wash dishes?  And now that you can't do so as easily, have made no effort to contribute in any other way?\n\nYTA.  Even though your mom wasn't the nicest in this interaction, i can see she is frustrated with you.", "Nta. Your mum is an idiot and dad enables her"]}
