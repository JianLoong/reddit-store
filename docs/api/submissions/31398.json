My sister (28F) who is autistic and can't drive, asked if I could get her something as well.

If there is no food then I\u2019m not surprised everyone wants in on what OP is getting. Why four meals takeaway in 1 day??", "That's true. I think the reason why I didn't want to do that was because it's a hassle to get food for everyone and I just wanted time for myself.", "It is a complete hassle cooking at home. The house is too small and my mom gets somewhat controlling about stove usage. When I'm at college I cook for myself, but when I'm home it's just been easier to get food for takeout.

If you live /stay with family and you want to get food only for you, you tell \"i'm just going for a drive / go to the mall windows shopping\" then you get your food and eat it there or in your car. Bc if the other family members find out you got food, the drama starts \"why didn't you say something? Why didn't you bring me something? Why didn't you bring it home to share?\" And so on. Especially family members are somehow weird when it comes to food. \n\nAnd IF you get them something the drama just gets started \"no, thats not what i wanted, yes, i said i want this but now i changed my mind. Why is the food cold? I don't want it anymore. You forgot to ask for my special sauce, i always take it, why didn't you remember?\" Blablabla\n\nI'm sure there have already been families broken up or going NC with each other over take out food. Its weird. For your own peace, do not mention anymore if you go get food (and don't bring it home with you).", "YTA - she asked nicely and offered to pay for her own food", "Just tell her if you want me to pick up food for everyone, you'll need some $$. If they don't pitch in , they don't get anything", "I just don't think getting takeout is working for you.\n\nCommunicate. Set a time you can cook. Share in family cooking time. Ask your mom to cook. Help with groceries, but keep it reasonable"]}
