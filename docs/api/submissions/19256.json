We didn\u2019t know he was coming but it was our first time meeting him so we didn\u2019t mind. \n\nWhen I got up to salute him, he took a look at my dress and said \"Wow, did you put that on just for me?\"\nI didn\u2019t really knew what to say and just awkwardly answered \"Ahah no, at all\" \nI then sat down and the night continued.\n\nMaybe one hour after what happened, he looked at me and said \"So, who\u2019s the lucky guy that\u2019s gonna have you and that pretty dress tonight?\" \n\nI once again felt uncomfortable and kept my answer short with \"Nobody except my bed\"\n\nHe went at it again and said \"You know what I just thought about? With a dress this short, the guy won\u2019t even need to take it off you\" \n\nI had enough of his comments but still politely told him I didn\u2019t want him to talk about my dress any further because it was making me uncomfortable. He apologized and said he wouldn\u2019t do it again.\n\nExcept, he did and this time, while we were toasting and raising our drinks in the air, he said: \"Here\u2019s to hoping the next dress will be shorter\" \n\nThat\u2019s when I lost it and was just like \"Okay enough\", I put down my drink, the money for the drinks as it was my round and just left.\n\nThe next morning I woke up to 5 missed calls from my friends and texts saying I\u2019d made everyone feel awkward for simple jokes, that I ruined everybody\u2019s good time and first meeting with our friend\u2019s bf and that I needed to stop being so sensitive if I wanted to keep friends around. \n\nAITA", "created_utc": 1686182211, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143taju/aita_for_causing_a_scene_after_my_friends/", "score": 155, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
