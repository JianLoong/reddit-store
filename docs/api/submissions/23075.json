I'm just playing devil's advocate with that one I would mention to him that you're thinking of doing that. I bet he'll really not want that because he realizes that he's being the absolute rude disrespectful noisy jerk. Same stuff in a bath that works should be totally feasible. He wasn't able to respect that so you needed to remove yourself to where you could sleep.
