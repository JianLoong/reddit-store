Or hell, maybe someone even said \"I heard OP just did X, you must be so proud of him\".\n\nAnyway point is, the way you described it made me think your mum was saying those things because she was shamed into it, had no idea how to do it properly and wasnt doing it because she wanted to, so was all monotone and no eye contact about it. Like a kid being forced to apologise for something.", "NTA. She was reciting what she was supposed to say to become a \u201cbetter parent\u201d. Someone clearly told her that she was being a shitty parent and told her that she should be proud of you. I\u2019m guessing that person was her partner. But just saying stuff with a flat tone while staring at a wall isn\u2019t even remotely close to actually telling someone they\u2019re proud, to their face and with feeling.

You\u2019re 18, maybe start looking into moving out on your own?", "NTA\n\nA changed tone, a look of shock from her husband and your reaction clearly show this was an incredibly odd episode. \n\nDon't let your past dictate your future and build the life you want going forward. 18 your coming into your own and will be able to do so.", "NTA\nKeep standing up for yourself", "NTA.  Mom is a complete unmitigated AH.  Please forgive me my ANGRY reply.", "NTA. Run from this toxic person. Looks like she never wanted you as her child, so nothing you said or did was good enough for her. As soon as you can get financially independent and move out, do it. It will save you thousands and thousands in  therapist/psychologist/psychiatrist bills down the line. Run.", "NTA. She didn't really say she was proud of you - in a monotone she said she was supposed to say things like that.

I\u2019m sorry communication had already broken down so far that she couldn\u2019t just say she has happy for you.

Of course you'd be unhappy when she tells you she's proud of you in that way, because she didn't actually say that she is; with the way she phrased it, and the monotone voice, plus it being apparently so out of character for her, the \"praise\" was very insincere. Your mum is TA all the way, you have no reason to feel guilty for how you reacted.", "INFO: If she was looking at a wall saying 'i'm proud of you' are you sure she was talking to you?! \ud83d\ude33", "YTA - cant know why she said those things, but the way she acted, most people here seem to be right: someone had a heart to heart with her and told her to cut the crap and be a better parent, and while her handling of the situation was pisspoor, the reaction \"kay, seems i cant do anything right\", kinda sounds like she actually tried to be better than before and you guys just shrugged it off. Dunno why anyone would want to stay in a toxic af Environment like that and would actually deflect any try to improve the situation, but giving someone shit for trying is an a-class asshole thing to do. \nBtw. not saying ur mum and ur stepdad arent assholes aswell, this whole familydynamic seems to be kinda shitty and there usually is some sort of line between being hurtful and poking fun at each other - which doesnt seem to exist in your household. \nThing is, none of us can look into your mums head and while i get most comments here, we cant actually know if someone forced her, pushed her or shamed her into saying that, but the thing is: if thats not the case and someone just made her realise how horrible she acted before and shes trying to do better now, your reaction was just ... not good. Despite me understanding how you feel and her pisspoor execution. \nAlso i think your new stepdad enables her shitty behaviour.", "[removed]", "NTA.

Forced apologies are meaningless because there is no remorse and repentence motivating them.\n\nForced compliments like this are meaningless because there is no enthusiasm and apprecation motivating them.\n\nHonestly, I'm not even sure it would be fair to call this a forced compliment.

Reciting a list of things you should be doing isn't doing them.\n\nIt wasn't even being done at a good time for the things being listed. It's like it was being said to get it done and over with so mom could later say \"I say these things to my child\" with a companion inner voice mutter of \"Well, I said them... once... not that I really meant it or wanted to, but I did say them when my kid could hear me\".", "Yes,  getting out of there as soon as you can sounds like a good idea!", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

She was being totally insincere, probably on purpose so that you would react badly and she'd be able to launch straight into \"nothing I do is good enough\" pity mode. Now she can say \"I did try to be a good parent! It's not my fault you rejected me!\" and keep being shitty without taking on any of the blame. This is the parenting equivalent of weaponised incompetence."]}
