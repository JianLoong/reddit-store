I've absolutely loved every single one of them except for one in particular, who just started working with the school 2 weeks ago, \"Jan\". \n\nMy son (6) has an IEP due to severe anxiety and ODD, and is in a \"special\" class for most of the day and this is where Jan was placed. Due to my son's ODD he has a lot of behaviors that require me to come in and help redirect. At first I genuinely liked her. She's very bubbly, always smiling, treats the kids well, etc etc. But my son came home last week saying she makes him uncomfortable and he doesn't want to be around her. When I asked why, he said she has continuously said things like \"I'm your mom now\" or \"I'm your mom here and you will listen to me\". Now, I'm not claiming my kid is perfect and this may be her way of attempting to get him to listen when he is at school and having an off day, but regardless it makes my son and me uncomfortable. \n\nI went to the school and asked for a meeting with her and the principal, which they quickly accommodated to, and I expressed my concern around the issue and stated that she is not to be telling my child that she is his mother. Jan immediately starts arguing and says to me directly \"I am his mom here\". So I told her she wasn't his mom at all and again told her she was to stop doing that because it was making my kid uncomfortable to a point of him not wanting to be around her. She continued to argue, saying that no, she WAS his mom here and he was to listen to her. I wasn't getting anywhere and Jan was becoming agitated with me so I told the principal that if she couldn't follow my very basic request than she wasn't to be around my son anymore. The principal has told me that she doesn't see the issue and I'm taking this too far and that she \"doesn't understand\" but it's making my son uncomfortable and I don't think we should have to deal with it, as it's going to lead to more behaviors. I've stood my ground and they have since removed Jan from that classroom. Since that point my son has had no behavior flare ups. However, I'm getting the cold shoulder from staff now.

If your son feels uncomfortable around his teacher that's going to cause problems. I am wondering if some of the confusion she's having is a cultural thing? I don't say this to downplay the problems it's causing, it's not ok even if it's well intentioned (and it sounds like it likely is done with benign intentions). But I'm not certain it's a cultural thing, this is just me giving a slight temporary pass for not jumping straight to full-out creep alert like I would if someone less new to our US culture said this to my kid. Regardless once she's told to stop she needs to stop. I am just thinking the way she tried to say she's his mom at school might be explained by different cultural factors. Because if she feels attacked that's not something you want to be dealing with. So now you might need to make a decision on whether you guys can come to an agreement where everyone understands you are all working with the same goal, your child's best interests being served by a committed teacher who cares about him that he is comfortable with and that you have an open dialogue with. I don't know whether there's another class with a teacher you may have better results with or if this class is the only one available at the school. If you liked her before and your son has friends and us doing well academically it might be better to talk to her about why this is such a big deal. If you think she really does already understand and keeps disrespecting your reasonable requests then another class may be the way to go. Or moving the teacher to another class. My daughter's pre-K teacher taught them all to count off on their fingers European style since she was from Bosnia. She quickly picked up the typical american way within a few years and I was honestly pretty bummed out because it was freaking hilarious and adorable to watch this class of 3- 4 year olds count starting with their thumbs. Not sure why I loved it, I just did. But breathe fire if you need to, I know sometimes it is the only way to advocate for your kid. Unfortunately this won't be the last time something is going to get weird involving teachers/school staff/ other kids and IEP/ARC issues. You are in the right, here for sure. Sometimes trying to politely work an issue out fails and fire breathing becomes necessary. I'm hoping this turns out to be a different type of misunderstanding. But I'll repeat again, you do what gets the results you need for your son. Myself I might see if maybe another term somewhere between teacher and mother would be a compromise, like my suggestion would be super hero or school auntie or something like that. Maybe a Somali word for aunt or something? Because the impulse of another adult to care for your child a lot isn't going to be one of the issues you'll be worried about frequently. I assure you. If you don't want to offer a compromise you absolutely don't have to though. Best of luck, you are doing a great job with this from your description. Your son is very lucky to have a dedicated mom.", "I would say judge her the AH even if it is a cultural difference and she doesn't understand the issue.

While I can't say I know much about Somalian culture, many African cultures have very different ideas of child rearing and the roles various adults in a child's life fulfill. In western culture, a mother or father is considered a very sacred and specific role--typically just to one person, and there's many a reddit post about step parents overstepping in that role as well. But it's very likely that in Jan's culture, \"being a mother\" really just means \"being a trusted, female caretaker who is in charge.\" So I think this needs to be explained to her, and how she's violating western values and making people uncomfortable, and that even though some words, roles or actions may be totally normal to her--they are not normal in her new home. Perhaps if she herself explains what she means when she says \"I'm his mother\" now, she means something completely different. It may also be that as English isn't her first language she doesn't know the verbiage to express what she really means, or that her original language doesn't have a direct translation she's aware of. \n\nAnd really, I may get some flack for this but someone who is from such a drastically different culture that likely views children, child rearing, child development and child psychology in VERY different ways should absolutely not be in charge of or even helping out in a special needs classroom.

And there\u2019s a movie about a teacher doing the exact same thing only it escalated and it wasn\u2019t very much \u201ctaking care \u201c.", "I dunno, maybe thats what the Teachers intent is.\n\nDoesn't change that it is making her student uncomfortable and has had it brought to her attention and refuses to stop. If its a simple semantic misunderstanding, surely a teacher should be capable of using different words other than \"Mom\".\n\nTeacher is definitely the AH in this situation for making the kid uncomfortable and not wanting to make him comfortable.", "This is glorious and exactly the kind of energy I plan to have when my son gets old enough for school.", "It is the exact same and people do use mommy sexually", "I really wouldn't argue it's a *lot* more, mom/mommy has some very strong sexual implications these days.", "Yeah, that's what I'm thinking is happening here. It seems that the principal should have taken a step back and asked her to explain what she means when she says she's his mother when he's at school. Probably could have fixed the entire situation by helping her find a different way to express that she's in charge in the classroom.", "Teachers have parental responsibility which is not the same thing as becoming the actual parent.\n\nI was a classroom assistant for children around this age and would definitely have been invited in for a disciplinary if I'd told a child I'm their new mum!\n\nIt is actually the school's responsibility to not let something this central to the concept of what a school is get lost in translation, and the head not doing it is concerning.", "It's so far down because if it was a simple language issue it should have been easily sorted out in the meeting rather than both the teacher and principle doubling down", "But if they live in an area that takes in many refugees, presumably some of them have children who enter the school system.", "We start on the thumb- I wouldn't have even considered starting elsewhere! \nDoes that mean in America children can only count to 8 on their fingers rather than 10? Or do you count 4 in order and then switch back to the thumb?", "Ohhh yeah I count 1, 2, 3 from the thumb, but to show three i don't use the thumb. Germans use the thumb to show three.", ">Does that mean in America children can only count to 8 on their fingers rather than 10? Or do you count 4 in order and then switch back to the thumb?\n\nasking the important questions here. I am suprisingly confused by this"]}
