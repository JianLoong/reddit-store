Most of the students at the school are from other countries and the school system has taken in a lot of refugee adults as ed techs and basic helpers around the school. I've absolutely loved every single one of them except for one in particular, who just started working with the school 2 weeks ago, \"Jan\". \n\nMy son (6) has an IEP due to severe anxiety and ODD, and is in a \"special\" class for most of the day and this is where Jan was placed. Due to my son's ODD he has a lot of behaviors that require me to come in and help redirect. At first I genuinely liked her. She's very bubbly, always smiling, treats the kids well, etc etc. But my son came home last week saying she makes him uncomfortable and he doesn't want to be around her. When I asked why, he said she has continuously said things like \"I'm your mom now\" or \"I'm your mom here and you will listen to me\". Now, I'm not claiming my kid is perfect and this may be her way of attempting to get him to listen when he is at school and having an off day, but regardless it makes my son and me uncomfortable. \n\nI went to the school and asked for a meeting with her and the principal, which they quickly accommodated to, and I expressed my concern around the issue and stated that she is not to be telling my child that she is his mother. Jan immediately starts arguing and says to me directly \"I am his mom here\". So I told her she wasn't his mom at all and again told her she was to stop doing that because it was making my kid uncomfortable to a point of him not wanting to be around her. She continued to argue, saying that no, she WAS his mom here and he was to listen to her. I wasn't getting anywhere and Jan was becoming agitated with me so I told the principal that if she couldn't follow my very basic request than she wasn't to be around my son anymore. The principal has told me that she doesn't see the issue and I'm taking this too far and that she \"doesn't understand\" but it's making my son uncomfortable and I don't think we should have to deal with it, as it's going to lead to more behaviors. I've stood my ground and they have since removed Jan from that classroom. Since that point my son has had no behavior flare ups. However, I'm getting the cold shoulder from staff now.

It should be the schools job to redirect and teacher her why it matters. I have not seen Jan since but I do not believe they went to the extreme of firing her.

This is a severe overstep. She might've been OK to tell him her position and that he needed to mind/listen to her, but saying she was his mom is beyond out of line. And yes, if it's a cultural difference, it's on the school to have that conversation with her and get it sorted. Apparently it's more than they want to do, so they just moved her as to deal with it.

I think that I understand what this woman is trying to accomplish by telling your son that \"She's the mom here\". She is trying to convince your son that he has to comply with her rules, but this is not the way she should approach this. By using this phrase, she is undermining your place in your son's mind, and that is NOT acceptable. There are many teachers in the world that believe that it is they who should control how the children think, not their parents. Parents on the other hand do have a responsibility to teach their children to respect their teachers. You seem to be a responsible parent, who is involved in your child's education and wellbeing, and I find nothing wrong with your actions.", "NTA \n\nShe is not Mom, she is TEACHER.

I am confused on this woman\u2019s behavior unless it is a cultural difference that I do not understand.Even if it was cultural it was upsetting your child and it needed to stop. You did the right thing for sure. teachers and caregivers are sometimes replacement caregivers during the day but are not the mom.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If your son feels uncomfortable around his teacher that's going to cause problems. I am wondering if some of the confusion she's having is a cultural thing? I don't say this to downplay the problems it's causing, it's not ok even if it's well intentioned (and it sounds like it likely is done with benign intentions). But I'm not certain it's a cultural thing, this is just me giving a slight temporary pass for not jumping straight to full-out creep alert like I would if someone less new to our US culture said this to my kid. Regardless once she's told to stop she needs to stop. I am just thinking the way she tried to say she's his mom at school might be explained by different cultural factors. Because if she feels attacked that's not something you want to be dealing with. So now you might need to make a decision on whether you guys can come to an agreement where everyone understands you are all working with the same goal, your child's best interests being served by a committed teacher who cares about him that he is comfortable with and that you have an open dialogue with. I don't know whether there's another class with a teacher you may have better results with or if this class is the only one available at the school. If you liked her before and your son has friends and us doing well academically it might be better to talk to her about why this is such a big deal. If you think she really does already understand and keeps disrespecting your reasonable requests then another class may be the way to go. Or moving the teacher to another class. My daughter's pre-K teacher taught them all to count off on their fingers European style since she was from Bosnia. She quickly picked up the typical american way within a few years and I was honestly pretty bummed out because it was freaking hilarious and adorable to watch this class of 3- 4 year olds count starting with their thumbs. Not sure why I loved it, I just did. But breathe fire if you need to, I know sometimes it is the only way to advocate for your kid. Unfortunately this won't be the last time something is going to get weird involving teachers/school staff/ other kids and IEP/ARC issues. You are in the right, here for sure. Sometimes trying to politely work an issue out fails and fire breathing becomes necessary. I'm hoping this turns out to be a different type of misunderstanding. But I'll repeat again, you do what gets the results you need for your son. Myself I might see if maybe another term somewhere between teacher and mother would be a compromise, like my suggestion would be super hero or school auntie or something like that. Maybe a Somali word for aunt or something? Because the impulse of another adult to care for your child a lot isn't going to be one of the issues you'll be worried about frequently. I assure you. If you don't want to offer a compromise you absolutely don't have to though. Best of luck, you are doing a great job with this from your description. Your son is very lucky to have a dedicated mom.", "I would say judge her the AH even if it is a cultural difference and she doesn't understand the issue. She doesn't have to understand, she just has to respect the OP's boundaries. And more importantly, OP's son's boundaries.\n\nObviously there are things where school/classroom policy trump what the parents think is best for their children, but this isn't one of them. This isn't a matter of safety, educational best practices, laws or regulations, school policy, or the practicalities of dealing with multiple students with conflicting needs. So what makes the student comfortable needs to be what happens, regardless of whether the teacher understands why the student feels that way or not."]}
