I've absolutely loved every single one of them except for one in particular, who just started working with the school 2 weeks ago, \"Jan\". \n\nMy son (6) has an IEP due to severe anxiety and ODD, and is in a \"special\" class for most of the day and this is where Jan was placed. Due to my son's ODD he has a lot of behaviors that require me to come in and help redirect. At first I genuinely liked her. She's very bubbly, always smiling, treats the kids well, etc etc. But my son came home last week saying she makes him uncomfortable and he doesn't want to be around her. When I asked why, he said she has continuously said things like \"I'm your mom now\" or \"I'm your mom here and you will listen to me\". Now, I'm not claiming my kid is perfect and this may be her way of attempting to get him to listen when he is at school and having an off day, but regardless it makes my son and me uncomfortable. \n\nI went to the school and asked for a meeting with her and the principal, which they quickly accommodated to, and I expressed my concern around the issue and stated that she is not to be telling my child that she is his mother. Jan immediately starts arguing and says to me directly \"I am his mom here\". So I told her she wasn't his mom at all and again told her she was to stop doing that because it was making my kid uncomfortable to a point of him not wanting to be around her. She continued to argue, saying that no, she WAS his mom here and he was to listen to her. I wasn't getting anywhere and Jan was becoming agitated with me so I told the principal that if she couldn't follow my very basic request than she wasn't to be around my son anymore. The principal has told me that she doesn't see the issue and I'm taking this too far and that she \"doesn't understand\" but it's making my son uncomfortable and I don't think we should have to deal with it, as it's going to lead to more behaviors. I've stood my ground and they have since removed Jan from that classroom. Since that point my son has had no behavior flare ups. However, I'm getting the cold shoulder from staff now.

If your son feels uncomfortable around his teacher that's going to cause problems. I am wondering if some of the confusion she's having is a cultural thing? I don't say this to downplay the problems it's causing, it's not ok even if it's well intentioned (and it sounds like it likely is done with benign intentions). But I'm not certain it's a cultural thing, this is just me giving a slight temporary pass for not jumping straight to full-out creep alert like I would if someone less new to our US culture said this to my kid. Regardless once she's told to stop she needs to stop. I am just thinking the way she tried to say she's his mom at school might be explained by different cultural factors. Because if she feels attacked that's not something you want to be dealing with. So now you might need to make a decision on whether you guys can come to an agreement where everyone understands you are all working with the same goal, your child's best interests being served by a committed teacher who cares about him that he is comfortable with and that you have an open dialogue with. I don't know whether there's another class with a teacher you may have better results with or if this class is the only one available at the school. If you liked her before and your son has friends and us doing well academically it might be better to talk to her about why this is such a big deal. If you think she really does already understand and keeps disrespecting your reasonable requests then another class may be the way to go. Or moving the teacher to another class. My daughter's pre-K teacher taught them all to count off on their fingers European style since she was from Bosnia. She quickly picked up the typical american way within a few years and I was honestly pretty bummed out because it was freaking hilarious and adorable to watch this class of 3- 4 year olds count starting with their thumbs. Not sure why I loved it, I just did. But breathe fire if you need to, I know sometimes it is the only way to advocate for your kid. Unfortunately this won't be the last time something is going to get weird involving teachers/school staff/ other kids and IEP/ARC issues. You are in the right, here for sure. Sometimes trying to politely work an issue out fails and fire breathing becomes necessary. I'm hoping this turns out to be a different type of misunderstanding. But I'll repeat again, you do what gets the results you need for your son. Myself I might see if maybe another term somewhere between teacher and mother would be a compromise, like my suggestion would be super hero or school auntie or something like that. Maybe a Somali word for aunt or something? Because the impulse of another adult to care for your child a lot isn't going to be one of the issues you'll be worried about frequently. I assure you. If you don't want to offer a compromise you absolutely don't have to though. Best of luck, you are doing a great job with this from your description. Your son is very lucky to have a dedicated mom.", "I would say judge her the AH even if it is a cultural difference and she doesn't understand the issue.

While I can't say I know much about Somalian culture, many African cultures have very different ideas of child rearing and the roles various adults in a child's life fulfill. In western culture, a mother or father is considered a very sacred and specific role--typically just to one person, and there's many a reddit post about step parents overstepping in that role as well. But it's very likely that in Jan's culture, \"being a mother\" really just means \"being a trusted, female caretaker who is in charge.\" So I think this needs to be explained to her, and how she's violating western values and making people uncomfortable, and that even though some words, roles or actions may be totally normal to her--they are not normal in her new home. Perhaps if she herself explains what she means when she says \"I'm his mother\" now, she means something completely different. It may also be that as English isn't her first language she doesn't know the verbiage to express what she really means, or that her original language doesn't have a direct translation she's aware of. \n\nAnd really, I may get some flack for this but someone who is from such a drastically different culture that likely views children, child rearing, child development and child psychology in VERY different ways should absolutely not be in charge of or even helping out in a special needs classroom.

And there\u2019s a movie about a teacher doing the exact same thing only it escalated and it wasn\u2019t very much \u201ctaking care \u201c.", "I dunno, maybe thats what the Teachers intent is.\n\nDoesn't change that it is making her student uncomfortable and has had it brought to her attention and refuses to stop. If its a simple semantic misunderstanding, surely a teacher should be capable of using different words other than \"Mom\".\n\nTeacher is definitely the AH in this situation for making the kid uncomfortable and not wanting to make him comfortable.", "This is glorious and exactly the kind of energy I plan to have when my son gets old enough for school.", "It is the exact same and people do use mommy sexually", "I really wouldn't argue it's a *lot* more, mom/mommy has some very strong sexual implications these days.", "Yeah, that's what I'm thinking is happening here. It seems that the principal should have taken a step back and asked her to explain what she means when she says she's his mother when he's at school. Probably could have fixed the entire situation by helping her find a different way to express that she's in charge in the classroom.", "Teachers have parental responsibility which is not the same thing as becoming the actual parent.\n\nI was a classroom assistant for children around this age and would definitely have been invited in for a disciplinary if I'd told a child I'm their new mum!\n\nIt is actually the school's responsibility to not let something this central to the concept of what a school is get lost in translation, and the head not doing it is concerning.", "It's so far down because if it was a simple language issue it should have been easily sorted out in the meeting rather than both the teacher and principle doubling down", "But if they live in an area that takes in many refugees, presumably some of them have children who enter the school system.", "We start on the thumb- I wouldn't have even considered starting elsewhere! \nDoes that mean in America children can only count to 8 on their fingers rather than 10? Or do you count 4 in order and then switch back to the thumb?", "Ohhh yeah I count 1, 2, 3 from the thumb, but to show three i don't use the thumb. Germans use the thumb to show three.", ">Does that mean in America children can only count to 8 on their fingers rather than 10? Or do you count 4 in order and then switch back to the thumb?\n\nasking the important questions here. I am suprisingly confused by this", "NTA you need to escalate this issue as both the teacher and principal are really strange.", "yta\n\nyou don\u2019t mention someone\u2019s nationality/ethnicity if that\u2019s not part of your problem with them.", "Does she think \u201cmom\u201d means teacher or some other authority figure? Regardless, it\u2019s a major overstep and the principal is a major AH as well for not even bothering to correct her. \n\nNTA at all.", "NTA. It is an issue and if these people can\u2019t see it they should not be teachers.", "NTA I think this is a cultural difference/translation problem that she doesn\u2019t understand, like the principal said. So I don\u2019t blame Jan for that.\n\nWhat I do blame Jan for is when she found out something she said was making you and your son uncomfortable, she argued instead of trying to understand what the problem was.\n\nAnd I also blame the principal here for failing to explain to Jan why it was inappropriate. If she doesn\u2019t understand, explain it to her!!!", "NTA", "NTA that's inappropriate, and confusing for your son and the other children.  They need to understand that mom and teacher are separate things, and both deserve to be respected.", "NTA contact the school district superintendent. Make heads roll. This is extremely inappropriate", "Major safeguarding red flag from both the TA and head. Not sure where you are but if you do have safeguarding standards I'd report my concerns to the correct board. The language is inappropriate at best, this could be a miss communication or cultural difference (doesn't stop it been an issue), but it becomes a safeguarding issue when you raised it and they refused to back down/listen. If his IEP covers anxiety, they had a responsibility to do something as soon as you raised the issue as it affects his anxiety. I work in education and know how hard things are right now, especially with finding staff but that never negates safeguarding.", "NTA it was a simple request. Don't use that term to my son. It makes him uncomfortable.\n\nHaving had a simple request made it should have been respected. And it for cultural reasons Jan didn't \"get it\" then the principal should have intervened.", "NAH. My gut feeling is this is a huge cultural misunderstanding on everyone's part.\n\nI work as an EL (English Learner) teacher and several of the families I work with are Somali. At conferences, I've frequently had parents tell their kids something along the lines of \"When you are at school, she is your mom.\" One mom recently told her son that disrespecting me is akin to disrespecting her. There's much more of a collective mindset to parenting, and Jan probably interpreted you saying she isn't his mom as school as saying your son doesn't have to listen to her when he's at school. I think that's why she immediately went into defensive mode when you asked her to stop saying it.", "NTA I don\u2019t understand why the principal thinks it\u2019s no big deal with the word choice saying a stranger gets to demand a kid call them and treat them as a parent instead of a teacher.", "As long as your son is doing good now, so what if the school staff is cold. I would be cold back - but I would also be/feel happy that my kid no longer felt uncomfortable. The school is out of line. You DON\u2019T  tell a kid that your their parent\u2026 period! Unless you actually are their parent. \nYour not the ass!", "I\u2019m inclined to say N A H. Cultural differences and translation seem to be the issue here. Many non-western cultures use \u201cmother\u201d to refer to the matriarch / female authority figure / older woman. Sounds like she was trying to make your son understand that she\u2019s the authority figure that he needs to listen to in the classroom. Things seem to have escalated from the misinterpretation when they needn\u2019t have. Either the principal should have mediated this situation better or the parent could\u2019ve been less reactive and more open to understanding the teacher\u2019s perspective.", "NTA but I wonder whether you were on the same page here and whether there might have been some cultural misunderstandings? Could she possibly mean \"I am the person in charge of you here, as your mom is at home, and you have to obey me as you obey your mom when you are at home\"? In that way, you'd be arguing that she isn't his mom, but she would be hearing \"you do not have to obey this lady\"?", "I worked with an older Somali lady (Somali is the correct term not Somalian, I don't know that before I worked with her). She told me to call her mommy. It must just be a cultural thing. I wouldn't read too far into it. She for sure means no harm. That lady and I were like best friends. I think it just means that she really likes your son and feels some sort of bond with him.", "NTA! OMG so NTA.  The audacity of that woman! NO she's not his mother! An authority figure yes, mother NO.", "NTA. Refugee or not, new or not, she being an asshole, and you handled this like an adult. You identified the behavior that was bothering you and directly discussed it with her. This could have been just a simple misunderstanding and a \"Oh, sorry, that didn't translate right.\" would have been the end of it. But insisting on violating this boundary after discussing it is not okay.", "NTA\n\nBut it is a culture and language issue.  The new Somali teacher doesn't understand the culture she has stepped into.  Where she is from, it is not unusual for all children to refer to all adults as Mother, Father, Grandmother, Grandfather, Aunt, Uncle.  But it is NOT common in the US.  As Jan is in the US, she needs to follow the expectations of the US.", "Why is it important to note the teacher is Somalian?", "NTA\n\nKid is uncomfortable. End of discussion. I would have interrupted her when she tried to defend herself with that", "remind her what life she had before she became a refugee.", "OP, if she is from another country, she is probably saying that she is the voice of authority at school and labeling it \"mom\".\n\nInstead of both of you beating your head against the wall and having a very obvious cultural misunderstanding ... why don't you, the adult who was raised in this culture, educate her?\n\nTell her, \"you are the authority when I am not around, I agree ... but a mother, in our culture, is very specific and it isn't appropriate to call yourself a \"mother\" when you didn't give birth to him or adopt him\". \n\nHave her Tell him that \"his mom said he needs to listen to her or that when mom isn't around she is the one who takes care of him at school\" ... I'll bet she would go for that.\n\nYou are getting the cold shoulder because you are culturally insensitive to someone who is trying to help your child but doesn't understand what is appropriate.  She is probably not being malicious.", "I see it more as a cultural issue than a language issue. This individual is a teacher who teaches in this language, and the principal who should have an even higher education level didn't think much of it. The principal alone should have been able to pick up on a mistranslation and clarified it. That's why I think it's more likely a culture issue between op and the current school where the teacher or individual in charge is considered the mother since children there are likely expected to always respect their parents to the highest degree.", "I think it is both language and cultural. I know in some African countries it is common for children to call any adult by a title like Auntie or Uncle (I believe), even if not related, as a sign of respect. I do think there are some crossed-wires here.", "This seems like the most likely explanation, but I don\u2019t know enough about the Somali language or culture", "NTA. If you have any text correspondence from the principal being a moron, send it to the school board", "This is exactly what I was thinking - a misunderstanding.\n\nBut if this is the case, Jan is ALSO culturally insensitive, this should go both ways.", "I'm flabbergasted that you read this post, and somehow still think that she didnt explain this and why it was an issue...\n\n\"you are culturally insensitive\"\nNevermind, I just went from flabbergasted to incredibly annoyed. Because this is insanely off-base and asinine.", "Culture is not a shield. I will be insensitive to any \"culture\" that behaves inappropriately in any social context. Ignorance is no excuse.", "It is. Many cultures refer to elders as Mother, Father, Auntie, Grandmother or Grandfather, according to their age, as a term of respect. You will see this often in far or east Asian cultures, African cultures, Native American or Inuit cultures - pretty much anywhere they hold a feeling of attachment through generations, and a deep respect for their elders. It isn't a disrespect to his birth giver.", "Yes there is cultural context missing here, the new teacher is from Africa. Perhaps it's common where she is from for the teacher to be called mother as a term of respect and authority. But she should stop when asked plainly by the actual parent.", "I mean, technically the school can be thought of as being \u201cin loco parentis\u201d when in charge of children, buuuuut that\u2019s not the same as \u201cI\u2019m your mom here\u201d, esp to a 6yo", "Yep. In America we typically go index, middle, ring, pinky, and then thumb.", "I always love learning something new! I would actually do this\u2026", "100% this. Jan knows she isn\u2019t literally mom. She should have clued into this and used the words \u201cI am in charge of you, like mom is at home\u201d with the kids in the first place. \n\nWhen the parent insisted she not use confusing, overly familiar language with the child, her doubling down was ridiculous. The objection was obvious. The pushback Jan issued was \u201cculturally insensitive\u201d toward people who use words and their definitions.", "No one said that it was a shield. At its core. This seems to be a cultural/ language misunderstanding. More than likely. If they get to the bottom of it, everyone can move forward and work together for this kid's benefit.\n\nOr everyone can be pissed off constantly. I guess that's also an option", "But it is when they refuse to stop when asked.", "\"Please, Madam, I have to go home to my village because my father died.\"\n\n\"Didn't your father die last month and also back in October?\"\n\n\"Yes, Madam, they were other fathers.\"\n\nA memory of my time in Africa.\n\nBut I agree that the teacher is being disrespectful if she knows she is upsetting the child. She has to learn to speak in a way that is acceptable in her new country. She can make her point by using a different word.", "Half Japanese here. Can confirm, it's common to call people terms like \"little sis\" \"grandpa\" \"son.\"\n\nHeck we do that in English, too, though not to the extent I've seen in Japanese culture. It's frequently met with resistance, like we see in OP's case.\n\nThis is not an excuse though. The new teacher, who seems to be one of the refugees (OP didn't really specify who exactly in this scenario is a refugee), has confusion that I can get behind giving benefit of the doubt at the beginning of their conversation. The principal, though, was oddly obtuse about this. Ultimately they did the right thing and removed the teacher unable to accommodate a pretty simple request in what seems to be a culture clash.", "I can\u2019t help but wonder if this all arose due to repeated \u201cyou\u2019re not my moms\u201d from the child\u2026I taught early el for one year with some very traumatized kids and you would for sure get that. It\u2019s not appropriate at all, but I think the reaction from the actual mom is a bit too far and almost willfully obtuse. This kind of strikes me as an ESH.", "This is exactly what I was thinking after reading that the principal agreed with the teacher", "The second one. I'm American and that's how I was taught. Although at some point I switched over to starting with the thumb, I think because of video games made in Japan, where they also do it like that.", "No, you just count the thumb last.

So 1-index finger 2-middle finger 3-ring finger 4-pinkie finger 5-thumb 6-index finger of other hand, etc", "So when counting in binary on your fingers, do you still start at index finger?", "it seems so strange to me to not use the fingers in the order they appear and instead loop back round to the thumb after the little finger.\n\nVery interesting, thank you", "Do you use your fingers for the nine times table trick? And if you do, do you count from your thumb then? Or would you still cycle from index, and jump back to thumb when you hit the 'down' finger?"]}
