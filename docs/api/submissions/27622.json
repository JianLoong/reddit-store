For the past 10ish years I have taken care of my sister along side with other caregivers. And before anyone ask, my mom is simply to old and unhealthy to care for her in recent years (she\u2019s also sorta been absent from caring for her).\n\nI would go to her house 7 days a week, I was there anywhere between 10pm-7am every day. Around 36 weeks I took leave to focus on myself and baby, my sister seem to have had an issue with this. She complained to anyone who would listen that I wouldn\u2019t talk to her. Mind you, I was strictly focusing on preparing for the arrival of my baby and hardly had time or mental energy to conversate with anyone.\n\nLilly is very emotionally demanding. She expects your time when she wants it. Being that her mind is at 15 years old despite being 45. I could not do this. I couldn\u2019t give her more of my time than I already had.\n\nAfter my baby was born I became so drained of any emotional or social energy. I struggled with postpartum depression, my physical recovery was painful and exhausting, I\u2019m still recovering intact. \nDuring this my sister bombarded everyone any myself for my time. Saying she couldn\u2019t understand why I wouldn\u2019t speak to her. I would go off to tell her she needed to give me time to recover, this wasn\u2019t good enough and she persisted.\n\nFinally I snapped, told her she was not entitled to my time and that iv been struggling with adjusting and that she needed to give me time. She constantly wanted to know when I\u2019d return to work (I get paid by the state to take care of her). Or when I\u2019d be by with my newborn.\n\nMy sister didn\u2019t like my radio silence and decided to fire me in the middle of my recovery because o wouldn\u2019t communicate with her. My husband has struggled finding work the past year and it\u2019s been incredibly hard, so she really threw us for a loop when she fired me. Our main source of income was now gone and my husbands job didn\u2019t pay nearly enough for us to sustain ourselves. I was livid.\n\nA week or so ago my husband got an amazing offer out of state, being we weren\u2019t finding work here we jumped on the opportunity largely due to the fact we\u2019d go homeless if we stood in a high cost of living state (we live in CA). We didn\u2019t want to leave our entire family behind but after searching for work endlessly it seemed like our only option.\n\nNow here\u2019s the part where I think I might be the AH. My sister hasn\u2019t spoken to me nor I to her. Everyone knows I\u2019m leaving expect her. I didn\u2019t exactly plan on telling her, but my family is pushing me to let her see my baby before I leave. I don\u2019t want to, but at the same time I feel it might not be worth the trouble avoiding her to appease my family. So, WIBTAH?\n\nEDIT: my return date was up in the air due to the complications I had during delivery.

She\u2019s not understanding why you would need that time away and was taking that silence personally. She went from seeing you every day to not speaking with you at all. She probably doesn\u2019t have that many people in her life to talk to so losing you was extra hard. I can imagine that having the mentality of a 15 year old can make it a even harder to fully grasp that you need time to recover. Of course she\u2019s emotionally draining - she\u2019s basically a teenager. She fired you because she was hurt. \n\nBut are you not letting your sister see your baby out of spite?

FMLA would have protected you, however she probably banked on you not causing a fuss because you are family.  Also with her mentality this level it's unlikely she had final say on your employment.  She would have a big say in it, but she most likely has an advocate who handles these decisions.  I would also file for unemployment to help with the cost of the move. \n\nShe knew what she was doing even with that level of mentality.  Move on and protect your child and nuclear family.  She needs to feel the consequences of her actions and this is a pretty big consequence.  Maybe she will think next time.", "YTA. You treated your sister like a burden and are surprised she got upset.

From what you described your sister is used to her demands for your time being met. You mentioned her maturity being behind. For this reason I think you shouldn\u2019t take her nastiness as personally. She sort of threw a tantrum trying to get your attention then fired you when she hit a dead end.

If those waivers go unused for a period of time usually 60-90 days they get cut off.", "She is your sister and your employer. As your employer, she wanted to know when she could expect you to return. You didn't respond. As her sister she wanted to talk to you, you didn't respond.\n\nI doubt firing you was easy, but you didn't communicate very well, to either your sister or your boss.", "ESH\n\nYou went silent on a job communication without a return date. Would you not expect to be terminated under those conditions?\n\nYour sister was being unreasonable here based on family ties. But so were you. The way you behaved wouldn't be tolerated at a different job either - you can't just not reply about your return date.", "No, BECAUSE THEY COULD BE SUED. \n\n\"Oh, you just had a baby and nearly died, but let us know you're going to need more time than usual to come back? YOU'RE FIRED\"\n\nYea, no. I'm 99% sure it's illegal to fire someone on maternity leave.", "I think too if things were good between you and your sister before you went on maternity leave, it's worth having the conversation with her that \"I'm sorry I wasn't communicating better, but I was really sick and had to go to the hospital. I was struggling just to shower or eat and couldn't think about work. I knew you were safe and being cared for by X, so I really couldn't talk right then. I'm not mad (now), but I will not be able to work for you in the future - I'm moving out of state so we can have better jobs which means no take backs. I love you and we'll visit when we are back in CA but I cannot communicate with you like I did when we saw each other every day either. It will be x many days a week/month okay?\" \n\nI don't know your sister's mental capacity, but my sister is not exactly even across her developmental areas. She is so much better at speaking and reading than she is at comprehension and we have to have conversations a minimum of 5 times before she understands a lot of things. Even if it will be repeated to her later, do yourself a favor and have that conversation with her spelling out what is happening, why, and what the new normal will be at least once before you go. That way you know at least one person has spelled things out for her and tried to set new expectations.", "Because it was a job and salary she was planning to return to. Unfortunately, in the US, lots of people end up taking unpaid parental leave.", "Are you assuming her parental leave was paid? Because in the US, it's not (with a few exceptions).", ">You went silent on a job communication without a return date.\n\nWhen someone is on leave, it is understood that there will be little to no communication with their employer.\n\nSo, going silent on the job while on maternity leave is completely expected behavior. I can only think of the worst possible employers who would expect constant contact from someone on maternity leave, especially if they had complications during the birth.\n\nAs for the return date, I don't see how that factors in because there was coverage for the time OP would be out, and generally return dates are dictated by how much leave the person has available.", "I should probably add this to my post, my return date wasn\u2019t set in stone because of the complications I had during birth. I kept getting extensions because havnt fully recovered. She was aware of this.", "But I completely agree, other jobs probably wouldn\u2019t tolerate it, the radio silence came from frustration on my end", "I was out for ten weeks on a pregnancy complication with two weeks for recovery post birth. Outside of communicating with HR about 4 times, I communicated with my boss personally about 4 times as well.\n\nI wasn\u2019t required to communicate directly with my boss, I chose to.", "Yea it\u2019s feeling really icky and I think that\u2019s a super important detail that needed to be in the main post, it\u2019s not like she dipped and disappeared for 6 months with no contact or communication", "You were planning to return but gave no return date. The sister is completely within her rights to want a paid caretaker to tend to her over an unpaid caretaker who can\u2019t perform her job duties, no matter how legit the reason.  Is pregnancy disability not available in your area? \n\nLet her see him but not hold him. If your family is siding with Sister, don\u2019t take him there with them present or you\u2019ll be TA for not permitting an angry and impulsive invalid to handle your baby.  NTA and m so glad you\u2019re getting out of there.", "She says\nOur main source of income was gone, (sorry don't know how to quote on cellphone)\nSo that makes me assume that it was in fact a paid leave (or the state didn't know she was on leave)", "In my state, it is illegal for employers to reach out while an employee is on leave. I can\u2019t imagine that California is any different.", "OP was having repeated extensions of their leave without a clear return date. I understand it was maternity leave, and communication would certainly be minimal. But that doesn't mean a person can just not respond about their return date and expect to still have a job.", "As long as you communicated the extension to her then you did what was needed. I had an extended maternity leave and I contacted them a total of 3 times in a 12 week period. You would not have been fired from a non-family job.", "I mean, other jobs, especially if you have FMLA or something of the sort, probably would tolerate having to get an extension, which it sounds like you got, *because of a traumatic birth,* especially within a month of the birth. \n\nCalifornia has even more protections in place, so they'd actually have to be way more accommodating. You were in communication, just not the way your sister wanted you to be. You'd probably be able to sue if you were in a different work environment.", "No job would tolerate it. FMLA is 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, you return or you don't have a job. Period. I have seen this many times working in HR.", "You got what you deserved and are now blaming a disabled person. I'm not really sure how you could be any worse.", "YTA. If you want to get paid you have to work. It's not that complicated. If you weren't working she had the right to fire you", "Calling someone an invalid is disgusting.", "If you aren't getting paid for the leave then you usually save up for it and plan to go back asap. It's still seen as an active job if you are on their records of current employment, and that helps with any loans you might have to take out.\n\nNo longer having a job means that she won't receive any pay and that they lost financial security on paper and literally. It's not a leave anymore it's permanent. Huge difference", "You can\u2019t communicate about their work but you do communicate about the timings for return to work and changes thereof, there is generally an approximate date given (births actually have a standard 6 weeks for vaginal and 8 weeks for c section to start, complications can obviously add to that but it has to be communicated) and a time which they will communicate an update. It\u2019s funny bc HR will sometimes talk to people on leaves that are uncertain once a week with updates to paperwork, etc for their short term disability.", "But would you be allowed to go on an indefinite leave with no end in sight?", "Cool, but if you fire your family member *they don't have to like you afterwards.*", "Especially when it seem like she was getting money for the job that she wasn\u2019t doing", "If a doctor signs off on it then yes", "Sometimes I read something and really understand America is a dystopia. I had complications post surgery so my return to work was open ended and it was perfectly fine. It got pushed back three times but I had a med cert and my employer didn\u2019t care. \n\n\nNTA to the post but god Damn I feel bad for you USians.", "No she wasn\u2019t. If you read her responses you will realize that it was UNPAID leave.", "She wasn\u2019t receiving money", "The job would still need communication from the employee or the doctor about that. You don't get to just go radio silent.", "In the US you get 12 weeks of FMLA. After that your job can fire you.", "Where? This is bogus. FMLA covers 12 weeks of unpaid job protection. You can't just go on leave indefinitely an expect an employer to keep the position open. They need someone to do the work.", "Which state would that be? I'm pretty sure that cannot be right. Indefinite leave AND not communicating to your employer when you'll be returning? That's insane. Even ADA says employers don't need to grant indefinite leave", "I'm not from the US, though I currently live here. This would definitely not fly in my country either. An individual employer may be understanding, but there are no laws to protect you if someone is not. That said, we do get 6 months of paid maternity leave, so maybe OP's particular situation would be fine. Employer would still expect you back after the 6 months are over, so not an indefinite leave. \n\nI'm assuming you communicated to your employer that your end date got pushed back, right? Or did you not communicate at all? Because I get leave end date being pushed back because reasons, I am having a hard time seeing how any employer would be ok with radio silence and no communication regarding what's going on"]}
