For the past 10ish years I have taken care of my sister along side with other caregivers. And before anyone ask, my mom is simply to old and unhealthy to care for her in recent years (she\u2019s also sorta been absent from caring for her).\n\nI would go to her house 7 days a week, I was there anywhere between 10pm-7am every day. Around 36 weeks I took leave to focus on myself and baby, my sister seem to have had an issue with this. She complained to anyone who would listen that I wouldn\u2019t talk to her. Mind you, I was strictly focusing on preparing for the arrival of my baby and hardly had time or mental energy to conversate with anyone.\n\nLilly is very emotionally demanding. She expects your time when she wants it. Being that her mind is at 15 years old despite being 45. I could not do this. I couldn\u2019t give her more of my time than I already had.\n\nAfter my baby was born I became so drained of any emotional or social energy. I struggled with postpartum depression, my physical recovery was painful and exhausting, I\u2019m still recovering intact. \nDuring this my sister bombarded everyone any myself for my time. Saying she couldn\u2019t understand why I wouldn\u2019t speak to her. I would go off to tell her she needed to give me time to recover, this wasn\u2019t good enough and she persisted.\n\nFinally I snapped, told her she was not entitled to my time and that iv been struggling with adjusting and that she needed to give me time. She constantly wanted to know when I\u2019d return to work (I get paid by the state to take care of her). Or when I\u2019d be by with my newborn.\n\nMy sister didn\u2019t like my radio silence and decided to fire me in the middle of my recovery because o wouldn\u2019t communicate with her. My husband has struggled finding work the past year and it\u2019s been incredibly hard, so she really threw us for a loop when she fired me. Our main source of income was now gone and my husbands job didn\u2019t pay nearly enough for us to sustain ourselves. I was livid.\n\nA week or so ago my husband got an amazing offer out of state, being we weren\u2019t finding work here we jumped on the opportunity largely due to the fact we\u2019d go homeless if we stood in a high cost of living state (we live in CA). We didn\u2019t want to leave our entire family behind but after searching for work endlessly it seemed like our only option.\n\nNow here\u2019s the part where I think I might be the AH. My sister hasn\u2019t spoken to me nor I to her. Everyone knows I\u2019m leaving expect her. I didn\u2019t exactly plan on telling her, but my family is pushing me to let her see my baby before I leave. I don\u2019t want to, but at the same time I feel it might not be worth the trouble avoiding her to appease my family. So, WIBTAH?\n\nEDIT: my return date was up in the air due to the complications I had during delivery.

She\u2019s not understanding why you would need that time away and was taking that silence personally. She went from seeing you every day to not speaking with you at all. She probably doesn\u2019t have that many people in her life to talk to so losing you was extra hard. I can imagine that having the mentality of a 15 year old can make it a even harder to fully grasp that you need time to recover. Of course she\u2019s emotionally draining - she\u2019s basically a teenager. She fired you because she was hurt. \n\nBut are you not letting your sister see your baby out of spite? Are you going to feel bad about not letting her meet your baby? Are you going to look back in regret? If the answer is yes, I think you should let your sister see your child.

FMLA would have protected you, however she probably banked on you not causing a fuss because you are family.  Also with her mentality this level it's unlikely she had final say on your employment.  She would have a big say in it, but she most likely has an advocate who handles these decisions.  I would also file for unemployment to help with the cost of the move. \n\nShe knew what she was doing even with that level of mentality.  Move on and protect your child and nuclear family.  She needs to feel the consequences of her actions and this is a pretty big consequence.  Maybe she will think next time.", "YTA. You treated your sister like a burden and are surprised she got upset.

From what you described your sister is used to her demands for your time being met. You mentioned her maturity being behind. For this reason I think you shouldn\u2019t take her nastiness as personally. She sort of threw a tantrum trying to get your attention then fired you when she hit a dead end.

If she saw the baby before you left, would that somehow make everything fine, and she'd magically understand everything you've been struggling with? \n\nOr would she find some way to interpret the situation to still be as angry, if not angrier? It's possible the main (if not only) reason she's mad at you and not the baby is because the baby's just an abstract until they're in the same room. \n\nI don't want to presume too much on your sister's mental state, but I suspect the only people who'd be satisfied by this visit would be the family members who probably hope you'll patch things up, find a way to stay, and get back to taking care of her.", "OP, if your husband didn't find this job, you two possibly are going to be homeless.. your sister literally are willing to make you homeless, firing you.. this already show you what the type of people she really is.. she may be a danger to your daughter, she has no right to see her, especially after what she did..", "Can I ask though have you thought of how this situation is going to get better ? Or how you want to fix it?\n\nWill you leaving without saying goodbye/clearing the air etc? It's all very reasonable to not bring your baby given her poor behaviour and treatment of you, but you sound like a caring person and I think if I was in this scenario without clearing the air it would be around avoidance and not wanting to have difficult discussions and then would lead me to feeling worse and more guilty. Given then that I would have moved states and not been easily able to fix it.\n\nObviously take all the time you need, but do have a think about whether or not fixing this will be better for you in the long run or a period of no contact is in the best interest for yourself, and enjoy soaking up the new born bubble", "I\u2019d let her see the baby, at least once before you leave.

It's terrible that she refused to understand that you also have needs. Standard maternity leave is 6 weeks when there aren't complications. You had serious complications and a newborn to care for. Where is *her* compassion for *you* after all the years you've taken care of her? \n\nShe knew she was taking your main income away, and firing you was malicious because it wasn't due to your job performance. She punished you for not bowing to her whims when you weren't able to do more than take care of yourself and your baby. I hope your husband, baby, and you thrive wherever you're relocating.\n\nI wouldn't take my baby to see her unless I could be certain there isn't going to be any passive-aggressive nonsense. Babies do pick up on \"vibes\" and tensions.

Wishing you all the best!", "Would you want to be cared for by a family member who completely ignores you when they're not on payroll (conveying the message that contact with you is a burden/oblligation)?\n\nBy your description, you treated her as just a client (who you wanted to leave you alone on maternity leave), not as your sister. If she's not going to get the benefit of being treated like family, why should she extend the same to you (most employers would not tolerate being ignored when asked for a return date for a critical position) and put up with the B.S. associated with working with family (like your resentment toward and lack of patience for her)?", "The sister wasn't without care.", "Yes, it\u2019s fine that she took a leave of absence and communicated that.It\u2019s also fine that she didn\u2019t have daily communication with her employer while on leave.My question is do you check in daily with your employer while on vacation?it\u2019s crazy that you don\u2019t think preparing for a literal human coming out of you is important.", "No. Any other employer with a confirmed 6 week maternity leave would not fire someone 4 weeks into their leave because the employee wasn't being social with them. You didn't do anything wrong and your sister is incredibly mean-spirited for what she's done.", "Yeah. I had a family member with Down\u2019s Syndrome.

I do think it would benefit you to look into some therapy for sorting out the very complicated feelings you have around the situation. I was an unpaid caregiver for my sister for a very long time and the resentment really built up. I think it might be good for you to reflect and untangle the experiences with a professional so that, if you want, you can have a functional family relationship down the line.

California\u2019s Pregnancy Disability Leave statute only applies if an employer has more than 5 employees. FMLA only applies if there are at least 50 employees. OP worked for her sister and it sounds like she had fewer that 5 employees. Therefore, she went radio silent at her own risk. Her employer deserved to know when she would be returning. Long detailed conversations were not required but ghosting her employer, who also happens to be an emotionally immature person, (which OP was more than aware of) was done at her own risk. Not saying she didn\u2019t have her own reasons and not saying her decision to leave without letting sister see the baby is right or wrong. Just saying that OP has to take responsibility for the consequences of her own actions. \n\nFWIW, I had a horrible post- birth experience.  I suffered massive blood loss several hours after giving birth. My doctor literally grabbed the blanket off the bed, wrapped it around his waist, told the nurses to get a crash cart, and did emergency surgery in my hospital room for an hour while my mom, husband, and nurse held me down. Afterward, the doctor told me he couldn\u2019t stop the bleeding and resorted to techniques he hadn\u2019t used since being an army doctor in Vietnam. I was in the hospital for SEVEN days, not OP\u2019s 3. I was on morphine for four days and incredibly strong other drugs after that to ward off infection and for the pain. I was discharged with a catheter for a full second week because the swelling was so bad from the emergency surgery to stop the bleeding I couldn\u2019t urinate naturally.  I was physically unable to care for my daughter for nearly a month. I could barely get from my bedroom to the couch without passing out.  I get that OP wasn\u2019t in a position to go back to work. Believe me. And if I knew my employer was expecting me back in two weeks, I would have either made the call myself or had someone do it for me.  And if I worked for my sister, I would have also leaned on my extended family to explain to said sister what was going on. OP chose not to do that. Fine. Her choice.  But it had consequences and while what her sister did was shitty and low, a little communication from OP could have gone a long way.", "She ghosted her sister!

If OP goes to see the sister, do not bring baby along. It sounds like it could end in a shouting match or even get physical if the sister doesn't take the news well. She's shown that she had no regard for OP's wellbeing and she's tried to bully her way (by firing OP). A next level escalation could be violent.", "Actually per her comments, she did not go unresponsive as an employee. The sister was kept aware of what was going on.", "idk about her sister but when i was 15 i didnt understand laws and i certainly didnt understand complicated subjects like disability protections and financial security.", "I think you\u2019re overestimate 15 yo\u2019s maturity.", "It's not just her employer though, it's her sister. And no, I don't think birth requires around the clock preparation that means you don't have time to message your sister every now and then.\n\nThe sister says OP was ignoring her, and OP never says that's inaccurate.", "She was on unpaid maternity leave. Her sister had another caregiver covering at the time. They also had a planned return date. OP basically got fired while on unpaid leave for something unrelated to work.", "It is more nuanced.

Sister had adequate care.  OP had her job security taken away in retaliation for breaking.  That\u2019s a horrid thing to do to family you supposedly care about.  Sister sounds like an energy vampire and a narcissist.  OP is NTA, and the people insisting she needed to suck up her PPD and exhaustion one month after a complicated birth to pacify a narcissistic vampire are jerks.", "I don't understand why people don't see how hurtful the sister's behavior is. OP had complications during birth and was fired when the baby was 4 weeks old because her sister wanted attention.  Why is there no compassion for what OP was experiencing? Nevermind how exhausting having a newborn is when everything goes as expected. The family complaining to OP should have been helping her and communicating with the sister on her behalf.", "Yeah and prior to that she was there every day. That would be such a huge change. I think if it didn't go from the sister being there all the time to radio silence this might not have happened. \n\nI hope she sees her sister to see if they can salvage the relationship.", "And Ffs, she was recovering from a rough pregnancy and on leave! If all I get is somebody yelling at me, yeah, it's  time to take care of me! Because I'm on leave! The sister is 45 with a 15 yo mindset ; that can't be helped, but a 15 yo can be reasond with. I get it she's disabled but she doesn't get to be a brat and have everyone run at her beck and call. That's the problem no one has ever told her no.", "If you visited do you think she'd ask you to help with her care while you were there? Or would she treat you as a sister visiting her sibling? If the first is true, I don't see how this would be productive.", "Then how did she financially cripple you - you weren't working, you weren't being paid.

Fifteen year olds are perfectly capable of understanding basic cause and effect.", "Why did you bring up fraud?  There\u2019s nothing pointing to it in the post. OP was on maternity leave, and her sister was informed of the medical events that delayed her return to work. There\u2019s even a comment that she wasn\u2019t paid while on leave.  \n\nIf you had a suspicion, you could have asked more questions instead of jumping to accusations. \n\nYour comment went from being helpful to being accusative of crime in a single sentence.", "Quick question: were you raised with the expectation and responsibility of being a caregiver? Because you seem like you care more about your family\u2019s feelings than yourself. I think moving away is probably the best thing for you and your child because otherwise the expectation would always be there that sister came first. How helpful were your family to you when you were facing difficulties? This might be something to think about and explore about why you let them make decisions for you with what sounds like could possibly be emotional blackmail.", "I'm just concerned that Lilly will act out against you and the baby again when she sees you in person and realizes you are leaving for good. I don't think it's a good idea to have this conversation in person. She may also be jealous of the baby because you are his caregiver now.", "Don\u2019t let her abuse you if you decide to visit, OP.

You didn\u2019t deserve that, and she does not deserve your forgiveness.", "It wasn't just about preparing for the birth.  OP suffered serious complications with her birth.

My sister requires a lot of emotional attention from people, she likes having visitors and talking to people: i simply could not give her more time than I had. So yes, I told her to give me space. Think clingy, but more intense.", "I mean I highly doubt the sister has 50 employees/caregivers so unless OP is working under a contract service (which seems unlikely) she doesn\u2019t actually qualify for FMLA and it\u2019s not protected leave. \n\nBut yes she would have been at 8 weeks not 12.  Assuming she hadn\u2019t taken any leave earlier in the year.", "thats not the sisters responsibility tho and it doesn't seem that sister is capable of understanding that.", "She actually kind of reacted like a 15 year old who felt abandoned by their daily caregiver suddenly. I doubt she really thinks of their daily contact as being a job despite the fact that she knows intellectually that her sister gets paid. And she won\u2019t be a worldly 15-year-old so she probably doesn\u2019t totally understand the financial strain she inflicted on her sister. It was probably more of a \u201cif she doesn\u2019t want to talk to me at all then I don\u2019t want her back either.\u201d She felt rejected as a sister so she rejected her back. \n\nI\u2019m more shocked that a lady with her delay is able to make those kinds of unilateral decisions. \n\nI\u2019m just watching this in awe as a Canadian though. Had this been Canada OP would have given her notice at 36 weeks that she was going to gone for 12-18 months and would have collected EI for that period, they would have hired another carer to fill in for that period and the job would have had to have been held.\n\nIt\u2019s shocking to me that women in the USA have the be planning their work return before birth.", "And who knows how long OP has taken care of this sister, how long she has been used as a caretaker even before she was paid to do it? It is possible she was already suffering from caretaker burnout and now had to put all her energy into her own core family especially after a difficult delivery. And I know 15 year olds can be selfish but the sisters reaction was extremely self centered and I can't blame OP for being angry. It is easy saying from the outside OP did wrong, but I think her life has been pretty difficult for a long while now, and her priorities have rightly shifted to her health an her child over her sister.", "You can\u2019t really blame PPD, though, because OP cut her sister off before she had the baby. So sister went from seeing her sister every day, all day, to complete silence. That\u2019s weird and imo makes OP the AH.", "I think this is an excellent point.  It determines what parameters the sister is able to see OP in.  If she cannot see her as anything but an extension of herself, or as someone who only exists to help her, then a visit would only cause trouble.", "OP said her husband lost his job. Her income as a caregiver was their primary income. The sister knew what she was doing to OP when she did it.", "Even a fifteen year old understands that babies need attention and have enough higher level thinking that develops at 12 to have basic human empathy. Having temper tantrums like she is is more like a 3 year old\u2019s behavior than a 15 year old. And they also know that things cost money. I think that the family just wants OP to get sucked back in so that none of them have to deal with her sister.", "Exactly, she is mentally 15, and not 5. I can give her some break for a tantrum or a few, but 15 usually understand what it is to be sick.", "Remember, the sister just had a baby, is struggling with PPD, has her hormones wacky, she and her husband were almost homeless with their baby.

I don't know how the benefit is structured because I don't live in the US. \n\nI never thought OP was intentionally defrauding anyone; just that if her birth was traumatic and she couldn't communicate with her sister due to PPD, that she might have also been too ill/distracted/stressed to communicate a change in circumstance to whoever needed to know.

All they owe is updated status on a return so there is coverage.  Leaves get extended all the time because injuries do not abide by a formula.

OP can schedule it an hour/ 45 min before something she needs to leave for (work, class, picking baby up from daycare, etc), so there\u2019s no risk of it stretching on endlessly, but she\u2019ll still be able to connect with her sister.
