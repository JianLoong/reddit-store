{"id": 8803, "submission_id": "10qe020", "title": "AITA for being \"disrespectful\" to my boyfriend's sister?", "selftext": "My (24F) boyfriend, \"Zack's\" (24M) mother passed away when he was 11 years old. His father worked a lot, so Zack's older sister, \"Elise\" (now 30F), basically became the \"woman of the house\" for lack of a better term. She cooked all the meals, cleaned the house, drove Zack to school and other activities, etc. She was extremely parentified and I do feel for her on that front. She went to a local college. Because of all this, Zack and Elise are very close, he has a lot of respect for her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nZack and I have dated for nearly a year. We are very different in terms of backgrounds. He is much more reserved than I am. Before me, he spent a lot of his weekends gaming or just hanging out with a small group of friends. I tend to go out. I work hard all week and want to enjoy the time I have off. Zack is a shy, somewhat nerdy guy and I do think I've broken him out of his shell a little, pushing him to do things out of his comfort zone. Elise and their father have made several comments about him changing. She's very nice and cordial when we see each other, but she's made several comments about Zack not needing to change who he is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSunday, Zack invited myself, some of his friends, his dad, sister, BIL and niece over to watch the game. At one point, vacations got brought up. I mentioned I was trying to convince him to go on a 2-day, local cruise with me as he's never been on one. Zack reminded me he's not the biggest fan of boats. I pointed out he's never been on one and we could rent one to take out so he could get used to it. He was somewhat on the fence. Myself and one of his buddies were trying to help him see it's not so bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nElise butted in and said \"If he doesn't want to go, then I'm sure you can find something else to do\". I said I was pretty sure I could talk him into it. She asked why I would want to go if he really didn't want to. I said of course I would never try to force him to go, but it's just something to think about. She repeated that he doesn't like boats and that I should respect that. I rolled my eyes, not really understanding why she was so adamant on this, and said she needed to relax, she's not his mother, she shouldn't care this much about the situation. Elise was clearly upset by the comment but didn't say anything else. The subject got changed and I thought all was well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA little later, Zack asked for my help getting something out of his room. Once in there, he told me I was out of line for how I spoke to his sister. I said she was the one that was getting up in our business. Zack said that I kept pushing it and got upset when I said, well clearly she and your dad didn't push you enough to try new things. He said I was being disrespectful and needed to apologize to Elise. I laughed and said no, she needs to butt out. Zack finally asked me to leave. I did, aggravated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really thought my friends would be on my side, but they said I crossed a line.

It's you deciding you know what he'll like better than he does and ignoring what he has to say. He's the one who should have spoken up, but likely didn't want to embarrass you by tell you to STFU. His sister stepped in to stop a bully. So yeah, YTA.", "YTA:\n\nYour boyfriend does not like boats. \n\nYour. Boyfriend. Does. Not. Like. Boats.\n\nIf it's clear that somebody doesn't want to do a particular vacation plan, you attempting to pressure him into it makes it extremely clear that this is a vacation for you not for the both of you. Find something you can both enjoy, which may or may not require you both stepping out of your comfort zone, but to a lesser degree than something one person has expressed a strong dislike of doing. Remember that not only is his sister not his mother (but she's extremely close to it) you are also not his mother.", "YTA\n\n>Zack reminded me he's not the biggest fan of boats.\n\nThis was him saying no to your idea and you kept pushing. It was good that he had his sister there to stop you because he doesn't seem to feel comfortable standing up to you. Perhaps because you keep pushing him out of his comfort zone when he doesn't want to be.", "YTA - So you brought up their dead mother......... Not a good look.", "YTA\n\nYou did cross a line. You got told something against what you wanted to do and then went to double down on it. When you didn\u2019t get any leighway you got attitude.\n\nShe\u2019s right though, why go on a whole ass cruise if he doesn\u2019t like boats? Start smaller. This seems more about you than him for a vacation sake.", "YTA.\n\n1. Badgering your partner to do things they don\u2019t want to do isn\u2019t \u2018breaking them out of their shell\u2019 it\u2019s harassing them into submission.\n\n2. You were rude AF to his sister who was merely sticking up for his interests.", "YTA\n He's said he doesn't want to go on a boat and your response is \"I'm going to keep pushing him until I get the answer I want\"\n\nYou don't even respect him, let alone his sister, who was standing up against you pressuring him", "YTA here. You definitely crossed the line given what you know about their past and the role she filled in his life. What you should've done was dropped the conversation in that moment, and continued it privately with him later.", "You\u2019re really TA here.  From a guy who\u2019s shy and more introverted, I understand the need to venture out of your comfort zone every once in a while, but publicly ganging up on him trying to change his mind will do the exact opposite. And the comment about Elise isn\u2019t his mother and how his dad and sister didn\u2019t push him enough was so out of line, and so tone deaf. They lost their mother, and at such young ages. I\u2019m 26 and I\u2019m dreading the day I lose mine. And what\u2019s the point of commenting that the sister went to community college? It obviously had no bearing on the situation. OP, an apology is needed for everyone in that family, like yesterday.", "YTA. She was advocating for her shy brother because she felt he was being badgered into something he wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about.\n\nIf you wanted him to consider it more, putting that pressure on him in a group setting isn\u2019t cool. I\u2019ve been pushed into doing things I don\u2019t like because I was in a group and didn\u2019t want to be the party pooper. I didn\u2019t appreciate it.\n\nYou\u2019d made your point. He wasn\u2019t unable to carry on thinking about it afterwards. You could have stopped talking and just left him to consider it. \n\nOn top of that, you then challenge his sister, roll your eyes at her - absurdly rude - and tell her \u201cyou\u2019re not his mother\u201d. His mother. Who is dead. Her mother. Then SHE had the good grace to cut the scenario short rather than make a further scene and you don\u2019t think you owe an apology for your rudeness and obliviousness?", "YTA\n\nWe tell women all the time that when a man is being pushy that \u201cNo,\u201d is a complete answer. This applies in reverse as well. When a man tells a woman no, that is his answer. If I saw someone badgering my bro/sis, along with a friend, after they\u2019d already declined, I\u2019d probably step in too, figuring the persistent request meant that perhaps the asker needed things explained simply and slowly.", "The moment you rolled your eyes like a child and told her shes not his mom was game over.

It seems like you're constantly pushing him to do things he wouldn't necessarily do otherwise, and I think this is not healthy. What's wrong with being shy and not wanting to do some things? Your way isn't the only correct way.\n\nAnd you did push him on this occasion too, and you _were_ being disrespectful to his sister.", "YTA \n\nIf I was a sibling and I saw their partner pressuring them to do something they didn't want to do, I'd have said something too.\n\nThe fact you continued to double down on this thing shows a lack of respect for Zack and his family.", "YTA. You were being pushy and not taking no for an answer. Elise called you out and you behaved like an immature brat. Honestly you sound like a bully. Date somebody who likes boats instead of bullying Zack into it. You owe Elise and Zach an apology.", "YTA Your not a girlfriend , your a control freak and don't be surprised if he brakes up with you\ncause you deserve it.", "YTA. He said no, you kept pushing and recruited a buddy to butt in (as you say) to help convince him. You immaturely rolled your eyes when his sister got involved to even the sides, then you reminded them that their mother is dead.", "YTA. Vacations should be enjoyable and relaxing for all parties involved. He doesn't like boats. So you pushing him to do what YOU like is an AH move. \n\nHis sister is right. Don't push him if he doesn't want to. Why do you insist on changing him?", "I'm with Zack on asking you to leave. You want to change someone? Change yourself into someone who accepts others for who they are and encourages them to grow when they can, not bullying them until they meet your standards for growth and change.\n\nApologise to Zack, his father, and sister. And then never pull this shit again. You'll lose long term. YTA", "Zack point blank told you you did something wrong and you\u2019re still wondering if you\u2019re the asshole?", "Yes, YTA. He was giving you clear signals that your suggestion didn't work for him, and you had to keep pushing. I'm not that surprised his sister stepped in to support him, since you didn't seem to be doing it.", "I assume you know that no means no?\n\nYeah YTA.", "YTA. You are being very pushy and aggressive. He already made it known to you that he does not like boats, so what is this nonsense about him having to speak up for himself? \n\nYou are the one who refuses to listen. And attacking the person who raised him? Do you really think that will get him to get on a boat?", "YTA, you acted like a brat, he was uncomfortable with your boat trip idea but you were pushy and you did disrespect his sister, I don't know if you haven't noticed, she actually acted as a mom to her younger brother and was there for him. You need to apologize to her", "YTA that was insensitive, disrespectful and rude AF. Their mother died. She took that motherly role. That comment was cruel. Zack needs the support to not do things as well.", "YTA. While it may sometimes be good for shy or withdrawn people to be encouraged to try something new, they still have the right to say no, or to refuse whatever you propose. You need to respect that and it doesn't seem like you do. You were aggressive and rude towards your bf's sister when she tried to point out that her brother doesn't like boats. Perhaps she knows her brother better than you do. There are, after all, lots of things people never do precisely because they know in advance they WON'T like it.", "YTA. Why are you even with him?

Repeat that till you figure it out", "INFO: you\u2019re clearly trying to change your boyfriend into someone you like/deem acceptable instead of loving him for who he is. Why are you dating someone you don\u2019t like or respect?", "please show your bf this post and your comments. you will be single by the end of the day!", "YTA. Now you can go on the boat by yourself", "YTA. \n\nI don\u2019t think you entirely like your boyfriend the way he is. Constantly having to convince (or, more bluntly, coerce) him to do what you want is not healthy. \n\nAnd you were disrespectful. His sister actually is the closest thing he has to a mother.", "YTA", "YTA - you could have brought the boat topic up in private. Why speak of it in front of her?", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t get to decide what her role is in your boyfriends life. The way you treated her was out of line and cruel. To be perfectly frank, why are you dating him? You don\u2019t agree with his relationship with his sister, he\u2019s too introverted and homebody-ish for you, and his family is correct\u2026you don\u2019t accept him for who he is. \n\nYou are spending a lot of time & energy trying to get him to do things he doesn\u2019t want to initially do. Even if he says it was fun afterwards, even if he loves it, you\u2019re still building a really unhealthy dynamic. You are building a relationship on trying to change someone. That never turns out well.", "There\u2019s a difference between \u201cgiving someone an opportunity to try something new\u201d vs, \u201cpushing someone to do something new.\u201d\n\nYTA. Even with you writing this from your POV it is clear that you are not respecting his boundaries.", "INFO: why does he not like boats- does he have a phobia of the ocean/open water or something? I feel like it doesn\u2019t make much sense otherwise for him to dislike boats if he\u2019s never been on one before", "YTA you sound like a bully.", "I think YTA but probably not irredeemably so. I think Elise is just being protective of her brother but if you could just calmly explain to her that you aren\u2019t trying to change who Zack is, you just think it would be beneficial for him to broaden his horizons a little and convince her you actually have his best interests at heart, just as she does, she would relax a little.\n\nWhat will NOT help is being hostile against her, or trying to push too hard against Zack\u2019s boundaries if he\u2019s told you boats are a firm no. It will make you look selfish and bull-headed in both Elise\u2019s and Zack\u2019s eyes. And honestly, the mother comment was way out of line and you should apologise for that if nothing else. \n\nSo I think keep doing what you\u2019re doing if it\u2019s truly motivated in good faith, but do it gently and know when to back off. And try not to alienate Elise, even if you consider her to be \u2018in your business\u2019 nothing good will come of trying to get in between her and Zack as you\u2019ve already found out. Try to put yourself if her position instead and think about how you\u2019d feel if you felt a friend was being controlled or manipulated by a partner, because rightly or wrongly that\u2019s probably Elise\u2019s fear right now.", "NTA.

You are angry because he won't make his boundaries more flexible than he already has. this is a one sided exchange in which you either get what you want or you throw a fit.

Let me tell you a little story. \n\nMy husband is outgoing and social; I\u2019m a bit quiet and reserved. When my husband and I had been dating for a bit, because of our personalities, he was often surprised at all of the things I\u2019ve done that he\u2019d like to do. \n\nOne example: he loves cruises, and I said I wasn\u2019t really interested. By this he assumed I have never travelled, when in fact I\u2019ve been to every national park in the US and have visited almost every state. I\u2019ve hiked parts of the Appalachian trail and the Rocky Mountains. I\u2019ve looked over the Grand Canyon and watched Old Faithful. \n\nI have no interest in a cruise because it doesn\u2019t really seem like traveling to me. I don\u2019t like being on boats because I get motion sickness, but also because I don\u2019t like being confined in one space with a ton of people. In fact, I don\u2019t like being around a ton of people while doing unnatural \u201cfun\u201d activities. It\u2019s just not my thing, and that\u2019s okay; it doesn\u2019t bother me that he likes it. \n\nYou seem to think that your boyfriend is boring and does little of interest, and that your way of being is \u201cbetter\u201d instead of different. Why would you not choose an activity you\u2019re both interested in doing?  Why is your way the right way?\n\nBeyond that, you\u2019re wholly disrespectful of both his boundaries and his sister. In a very real way, she *was* his mother, and even if she didn\u2019t help raise him, you have no right to judge their relationship.", "o Sounds like he isn't ready to be a part of a relationship.  If you mattered to him, he wouldn't be asking his sister for permission.", "I get incredibly anxious in crowds and places that I know don't have a quick exit. I'm also very motion sick. So boats are a huge no for me. Yet so often people try to lecture me or convince me I just need to try a cruise. I hate it and I feel like I'm made to feel stupid for my very valid feelings and health concerns. \nSo YTA. Cruises aren't for everyone so let it go.", "YTA. Why do you want to change him? YTA for that and YTA for what you said to his sister. If you can\u2019t love him for who he is, why are you dating him?", "YTA - it's surprising you think that your thought process is reasonable....", "YTA, complaining that his sister thinks she knows better when in your mind you are the one that knows better.

Not everyone has a fraternity/sorority party mindset.", "YTA.\n\nHis sister was trying to get across an important point - that you were completely ignoring Zack's wants and needs. She's right; he shouldn't have to change just because YOU want him to. If you want a more outgoing guy who likes boats, find one.

Let me ask you this have you ever taken any interest in doing the things he enjoys have you ever done something out of your comfort zone for him? I'm guessing the answer to both of those is no.

I think that's something that you really need to learn.", "YTA\n\nSo, why do you want to change everything about your bf to be more like you? Why is your lifestyle so much greater than his?

Yes there\u2019s nothing wrong with sitting at home all the time, but it\u2019s good to try new things that way you know if you like them or not.

That being said you took it too far with the, \"You're not his mother\", comment considering their mother passed away.

That's a major red flag that a person just isn't willing to try anything new.\n\nChoosing to do things like gaming and reading is completely valid for people who have enough life experiences to really know what they want.", "And also invalidates the motherly role the sister did play in her brother's life. She shouldn't have been in put that position but she was, and she deserves respect for it.", "BIG time. She could have been completely right in every other facet of this situation (she wasn\u2019t) and still be the AH for this comment alone.", "So, so, so shitty.", "I'm generally an introvert, but I can be social til it'd be uncomfortable for an extrovert with the right people.  Loud club?  NEVER, the fuck would you be doing suggesting it?  Bad movie night with friends? YEAH, LET'S MOCK THE LOW HANGING FRUIT!!!  Rock concert?  Noooooooooooo... Anime convention?  Can I go with friends?  \n\nThey aren't going on adventures they can both enjoy, they're going on *her* adventures, and isn't that just a bit f\\*cked?", "I remember that one.  She was ah", "Do you have a link?", "I\u2019m an introvert and I try to try new things but definitely on my own terms. It would be so tiring to have someone insist you do things you don\u2019t want to all the time. \n\nAlso YTA.", "That was life with my extrovert mother growing up.  I think extroverts see themselves as normal, and don't know how to deal with introverts.  \"just go party\" is what I got told. No.", "It could be his quiet, nonconfrontational way of saying no.  Saying you're not a fan of something should be a clue to the person that you're not interested", "Well regardless, I think you may be single now... Or soon...", "You literally disrespected his mother actually she is more than that. She wasn\u2019t supposed to raise a child that isn\u2019t hers and she still did and you a heartless AH decided to disrespect both of them and the dead mother in front of his friend by saying she isn\u2019t his mother", "You're right.", "I suppose but if he doesn\u2019t like it he can break up with her.", "She was talking to her boyfriend about taking a trip whilst the sister was trying to reprimand her for said trip. See the difference? It\u2019s WEIRD y\u2019all are ODD", "Yet he was only upset that she told his sister to mind her own business.  He wasn\u2019t upset that she wanted him to do something new.  He\u2019s a stinking mama\u2019s boy, only with a sister.  OP is NTA, sister/mama and her sisters-boy are the TA.", "[removed]", "This is exactly what upset me the most.  She raised him so IS his mother figure.  OP was completely disrespectful of their relationship \n\nYTA OP", "Yeah especially through the comments it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s trying to \u201cfix\u201d Zack to be what she wants", "Honestly, and I know this isn't true of all extroverts, but a lot of extroverts genuinely just can't bear to keep their own company. An introvert can learn to be more outgoing, but they'll ultimately prefer to stay in and tend to their hobbies. A lot of extroverts though will basically die in side if they're forced to contend with themselves.", "Not being a fan of something implies that you're not against it. I'm not a fan of birds for example, would never own one myself and have no interest at interacting with them but have no issue being around one. \n\n\nShe's was immature and disrespectful to someone who is a mother figure to him, she basically diregarded the important role his sister had in his life. The least he could do was to say something. \n\nHe should be better at setting boundaries.", "Same! When I was looking to date, they had to reach out to me first and take certain initiatives because I'm a strong personality, and tend to befriend introverts that are more resevered in their views, and while I'm aware of their desires mostly, I have a tendency to railroad. I knew I needed someone who could better hold me accountable. Zack and OP might be really good for eachother to balance out, but he is going to have to learn to stand up for himself, and she is going to have to learn that his hesitancy means no, or at least stop for now.", "The sister was reprimanding her cause she was trying to force someone to do something they\u2019re uncomfortable with", "Please reread the post. She was not just talking to her boyfriend. Second of all, her repeating what her brother said doesn't make it a reprimand. I think it's really easy to assume tone based on how OP wrote it.", "The only thing that's stinking here is your double standards...", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Either your friends respect boundaries or they don't, it doesn't have to do with their energy needs", "As a kid my step-mom drilled into me that I was never allowed to voice my own tastes so bluntly. I could say \"I'm not a fan of this\" or \"it isn't my favorite\" but never I don't want to, I hate, or I don't like. It was seen as very disrespectful. Because of this if someone tells me they're not a fan of something I interpret it as a full stop.", "It\u2019s too bad that y\u2019all view a little pushing as forcing. Partners are supposed to bring each other out of the comfort zone. He\u2019s a GROWN MAN y\u2019all. He\u2019s perfectly capable of handling life on his own.", "I infact read the post. Just because someone finds your opinion ridiculous doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t know what\u2019s being said.", "I agree with you. I'm an introvert married to an extreme extrovert, he can't walk outside without stopping to talk to every single person along the way. I prefer being at home while he'd rather be out doing something. We have to compromise on a lot of things, but he won't push the issue if I'm really uncomfortable and i try my best to try all the things I'm comfortable with at the same time. I'm sure he's missed out on things he would have really enjoyed, but being in a relationship is doing what makes each other happy. \nOP, you really crossed a line with his sister whom you even stated was the mother figure in his life and she was right to say that people shouldn't change for someone else. If your bf has asked for help being a bit more social/outgoing/what have you than its one thing, but if he's saying he isn't comfortable it's a jerk move to push. YTA for making something so small into a bigger issue that pulled others into something that should have been taken private after the first objection. Then you were a jerk to his family, it's really rude to roll your eyes and you should know that by now.", "She isn\u2019t accepting his no, though. She just keeps insisting she can talk him into something he\u2019s already said he\u2019s not comfortable with.", "He's standing up for himself, she's not listening. She's just more persistent than him but he will have a breaking point.", "No one enjoys being a wallflower at a party; we do it because we're not enjoying the party.  I do love the image, though.", "This made me laugh!", "I was gonna agree with you but then you brought up some 3,000 year old pseudo-scientific star sign nonsense as an argument", "Understandable, but some people, particularly the neurodiverse, don't always understand indirect communication.  Hearts to you for being raised that way, it sucks, I know.", "To be fair I'm very similar in my culture no one says \"no\" to anything the polite thing is to use euphemisms. I might have been to harsh in my judgment because of experiences I've had as a women and with neurodivergent people i resent this kind of politeness.", "I am the same as you, and I am neurodivergent myself. I can (and tend to) gradually become firmer in my response when someone persists. I've found that people typically either persist or assume (correctly) that I mean no, nobody's ever assumed I was saying yes when I'm \"not a fan of\" something. I understand why it might be an issue if someone can't take no for an answer or the person who gives a vague 'I'm not into this' answer can't be firm when asked again.\n\nMy family also went boating this summer. I was invited. I said, \"I can go to take photos and look after your bags on the shore, but I'm not a fan of murky water,\" they persisted, worried I'd feel left out or something. I reassured them that I won't feel left out. I won't enjoy myself if I went, and not just that, but I will ruin everyone's experience with an inevitable panic attack. Eventually, I firmly told them 'no' with no reasons and they seem dejected by that but I took the photos I promised and they like the photos, and can see that I had a good time from the shore.\n\nI live with trauma, and I know the unknown of the murky water, along with the lack of escape routes in the boat, would cause a panic attack. I don't need to try it to know that. OP's boyfriend doesn't need to have been in a boat to know he won't enjoy it either, even if it's not necessarily for the same reasons as me.\n\nThe way OP wrote 'I can talk him into it' rubbed me the wrong way and I can't put my finger on why.", "I am an extrovert and my husband an introvert. We have made many of compromises, but we also do thing separately. A few times I have gone on week-long white water trips with friends. He doesn't want to go on those it isn't fun for him. He has compromised and gone on a few day trips with me. He has a small group of friends he is happy to hang around with. Sometimes I am there, sometimes it is just them, a few times we have all gone on camping trips together. He loves camping and fishing and hiking, as do I. He just doesn't like huge groups or lots of unknown people. It has always been a give and take and it has worked really well. \n\nOP seems to give nothing and constantly be pressuring, convincing, and has no respect for the person that raised him. Yes it is not cool, they both probably have trauma due to it, and they are both probably close because of it. This is a one-sided relationship and OP is trying to make an extrovert out of her introvert SO.", "Yes, yes, yes! She is also bent out of shape about sister butting in but they were talking about it in front of everyone. If you do not want someone to butt in don't talk in front of other people. OP was really rude and inconsiderate of her boyfriend's sister and clearly has no boundaries. \n\nOP - YTA", "He's not saying no though. Not being fan of something and being against it is not the same thing. Also He's never been in a boat, makes no sense to say he's not a fan of boats. He could say i have no interest going in a cruise we will have to figure out something else might have work better.\n\nA bigger discussion about how much and when is appropriate to push on these issues could improve this dynamic overall.", "Um, yes, I do! I prefer to observe,  not participate.", "Thank you. It is something that I have gotten better about. I do fall within the neurodiverse spectrum which is why I think I end up falling back on trying to be polite if I am not in danger but am uncomfortable.\n\nSometimes the emphasis on some words, like no, can sound a little too harsh if I am anxious or really passionate about the topic. It's great in meetings. /s", "I completely understand. I'm much better at saying no to people if I sense I am in danger or if I am in a one on one setting with someone that I know shares a mutual respect. I think that is where it was different for me with this post. It seems as though she doesn't respect who he is. So she's pushing him to change into someone he isn't."]}
