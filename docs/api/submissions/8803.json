{"id": 8803, "submission_id": "10qe020", "title": "AITA for being \"disrespectful\" to my boyfriend's sister?", "selftext": "My (24F) boyfriend, \"Zack's\" (24M) mother passed away when he was 11 years old. His father worked a lot, so Zack's older sister, \"Elise\" (now 30F), basically became the \"woman of the house\" for lack of a better term. She cooked all the meals, cleaned the house, drove Zack to school and other activities, etc. She was extremely parentified and I do feel for her on that front. She went to a local college. Because of all this, Zack and Elise are very close, he has a lot of respect for her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nZack and I have dated for nearly a year. We are very different in terms of backgrounds. He is much more reserved than I am. Before me, he spent a lot of his weekends gaming or just hanging out with a small group of friends. I tend to go out. I work hard all week and want to enjoy the time I have off. Zack is a shy, somewhat nerdy guy and I do think I've broken him out of his shell a little, pushing him to do things out of his comfort zone. Elise and their father have made several comments about him changing. She's very nice and cordial when we see each other, but she's made several comments about Zack not needing to change who he is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSunday, Zack invited myself, some of his friends, his dad, sister, BIL and niece over to watch the game. At one point, vacations got brought up. I mentioned I was trying to convince him to go on a 2-day, local cruise with me as he's never been on one. Zack reminded me he's not the biggest fan of boats. I pointed out he's never been on one and we could rent one to take out so he could get used to it. He was somewhat on the fence. Myself and one of his buddies were trying to help him see it's not so bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nElise butted in and said \"If he doesn't want to go, then I'm sure you can find something else to do\". I said I was pretty sure I could talk him into it. She asked why I would want to go if he really didn't want to. I said of course I would never try to force him to go, but it's just something to think about. She repeated that he doesn't like boats and that I should respect that. I rolled my eyes, not really understanding why she was so adamant on this, and said she needed to relax, she's not his mother, she shouldn't care this much about the situation. Elise was clearly upset by the comment but didn't say anything else. The subject got changed and I thought all was well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA little later, Zack asked for my help getting something out of his room. Once in there, he told me I was out of line for how I spoke to his sister. I said she was the one that was getting up in our business. Zack said that I kept pushing it and got upset when I said, well clearly she and your dad didn't push you enough to try new things. He said I was being disrespectful and needed to apologize to Elise. I laughed and said no, she needs to butt out. Zack finally asked me to leave. I did, aggravated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really thought my friends would be on my side, but they said I crossed a line.

It's you deciding you know what he'll like better than he does and ignoring what he has to say. He's the one who should have spoken up, but likely didn't want to embarrass you by tell you to STFU. His sister stepped in to stop a bully. So yeah, YTA.", "YTA:\n\nYour boyfriend does not like boats. \n\nYour. Boyfriend. Does. Not. Like. Boats.\n\nIf it's clear that somebody doesn't want to do a particular vacation plan, you attempting to pressure him into it makes it extremely clear that this is a vacation for you not for the both of you. Find something you can both enjoy, which may or may not require you both stepping out of your comfort zone, but to a lesser degree than something one person has expressed a strong dislike of doing. Remember that not only is his sister not his mother (but she's extremely close to it) you are also not his mother.", "YTA\n\n>Zack reminded me he's not the biggest fan of boats.\n\nThis was him saying no to your idea and you kept pushing. It was good that he had his sister there to stop you because he doesn't seem to feel comfortable standing up to you. Perhaps because you keep pushing him out of his comfort zone when he doesn't want to be.", "YTA - So you brought up their dead mother......... Not a good look.", "YTA\n\nYou did cross a line. You got told something against what you wanted to do and then went to double down on it. When you didn\u2019t get any leighway you got attitude.\n\nShe\u2019s right though, why go on a whole ass cruise if he doesn\u2019t like boats? Start smaller. This seems more about you than him for a vacation sake.", "YTA.\n\n1. Badgering your partner to do things they don\u2019t want to do isn\u2019t \u2018breaking them out of their shell\u2019 it\u2019s harassing them into submission.\n\n2. You were rude AF to his sister who was merely sticking up for his interests.", "YTA\n He's said he doesn't want to go on a boat and your response is \"I'm going to keep pushing him until I get the answer I want\"\n\nYou don't even respect him, let alone his sister, who was standing up against you pressuring him", "YTA here. You definitely crossed the line given what you know about their past and the role she filled in his life. What you should've done was dropped the conversation in that moment, and continued it privately with him later.", "You\u2019re really TA here.  From a guy who\u2019s shy and more introverted, I understand the need to venture out of your comfort zone every once in a while, but publicly ganging up on him trying to change his mind will do the exact opposite. And the comment about Elise isn\u2019t his mother and how his dad and sister didn\u2019t push him enough was so out of line, and so tone deaf. They lost their mother, and at such young ages. I\u2019m 26 and I\u2019m dreading the day I lose mine. And what\u2019s the point of commenting that the sister went to community college? It obviously had no bearing on the situation. OP, an apology is needed for everyone in that family, like yesterday.", "YTA. She was advocating for her shy brother because she felt he was being badgered into something he wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about.\n\nIf you wanted him to consider it more, putting that pressure on him in a group setting isn\u2019t cool. I\u2019ve been pushed into doing things I don\u2019t like because I was in a group and didn\u2019t want to be the party pooper. I didn\u2019t appreciate it.\n\nYou\u2019d made your point. He wasn\u2019t unable to carry on thinking about it afterwards. You could have stopped talking and just left him to consider it. \n\nOn top of that, you then challenge his sister, roll your eyes at her - absurdly rude - and tell her \u201cyou\u2019re not his mother\u201d. His mother. Who is dead. Her mother. Then SHE had the good grace to cut the scenario short rather than make a further scene and you don\u2019t think you owe an apology for your rudeness and obliviousness?", "YTA\n\nWe tell women all the time that when a man is being pushy that \u201cNo,\u201d is a complete answer. This applies in reverse as well. When a man tells a woman no, that is his answer. If I saw someone badgering my bro/sis, along with a friend, after they\u2019d already declined, I\u2019d probably step in too, figuring the persistent request meant that perhaps the asker needed things explained simply and slowly.", "The moment you rolled your eyes like a child and told her shes not his mom was game over.

It seems like you're constantly pushing him to do things he wouldn't necessarily do otherwise, and I think this is not healthy. What's wrong with being shy and not wanting to do some things? Your way isn't the only correct way.\n\nAnd you did push him on this occasion too, and you _were_ being disrespectful to his sister.", "YTA \n\nIf I was a sibling and I saw their partner pressuring them to do something they didn't want to do, I'd have said something too.\n\nThe fact you continued to double down on this thing shows a lack of respect for Zack and his family.", "YTA. You were being pushy and not taking no for an answer. Elise called you out and you behaved like an immature brat. Honestly you sound like a bully. Date somebody who likes boats instead of bullying Zack into it. You owe Elise and Zach an apology.", "YTA Your not a girlfriend , your a control freak and don't be surprised if he brakes up with you\ncause you deserve it.", "YTA. He said no, you kept pushing and recruited a buddy to butt in (as you say) to help convince him. You immaturely rolled your eyes when his sister got involved to even the sides, then you reminded them that their mother is dead.", "YTA. Vacations should be enjoyable and relaxing for all parties involved. He doesn't like boats. So you pushing him to do what YOU like is an AH move. \n\nHis sister is right. Don't push him if he doesn't want to. Why do you insist on changing him?", "I'm with Zack on asking you to leave. You want to change someone? Change yourself into someone who accepts others for who they are and encourages them to grow when they can, not bullying them until they meet your standards for growth and change.\n\nApologise to Zack, his father, and sister. And then never pull this shit again. You'll lose long term. YTA", "Zack point blank told you you did something wrong and you\u2019re still wondering if you\u2019re the asshole?", "Yes, YTA. He was giving you clear signals that your suggestion didn't work for him, and you had to keep pushing. I'm not that surprised his sister stepped in to support him, since you didn't seem to be doing it.", "I assume you know that no means no?\n\nYeah YTA.", "YTA. You are being very pushy and aggressive. He already made it known to you that he does not like boats, so what is this nonsense about him having to speak up for himself? \n\nYou are the one who refuses to listen. And attacking the person who raised him? Do you really think that will get him to get on a boat?", "YTA, you acted like a brat, he was uncomfortable with your boat trip idea but you were pushy and you did disrespect his sister, I don't know if you haven't noticed, she actually acted as a mom to her younger brother and was there for him. You need to apologize to her", "YTA that was insensitive, disrespectful and rude AF. Their mother died. She took that motherly role. That comment was cruel. Zack needs the support to not do things as well.", "YTA. While it may sometimes be good for shy or withdrawn people to be encouraged to try something new, they still have the right to say no, or to refuse whatever you propose. You need to respect that and it doesn't seem like you do. You were aggressive and rude towards your bf's sister when she tried to point out that her brother doesn't like boats. Perhaps she knows her brother better than you do. There are, after all, lots of things people never do precisely because they know in advance they WON'T like it.", "YTA. Why are you even with him? You just can't accept him for who he is. You want to change him. YTA", "YTA no means no. No means no. No means no. Repeat that till you figure it out", "INFO: you\u2019re clearly trying to change your boyfriend into someone you like/deem acceptable instead of loving him for who he is. Why are you dating someone you don\u2019t like or respect?", "please show your bf this post and your comments. you will be single by the end of the day!", "YTA. Now you can go on the boat by yourself", "YTA. \n\nI don\u2019t think you entirely like your boyfriend the way he is. Constantly having to convince (or, more bluntly, coerce) him to do what you want is not healthy. \n\nAnd you were disrespectful. His sister actually is the closest thing he has to a mother.", "YTA", "YTA - you could have brought the boat topic up in private. Why speak of it in front of her?", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t get to decide what her role is in your boyfriends life. The way you treated her was out of line and cruel. To be perfectly frank, why are you dating him? You don\u2019t agree with his relationship with his sister, he\u2019s too introverted and homebody-ish for you, and his family is correct\u2026you don\u2019t accept him for who he is. \n\nYou are spending a lot of time & energy trying to get him to do things he doesn\u2019t want to initially do. Even if he says it was fun afterwards, even if he loves it, you\u2019re still building a really unhealthy dynamic. You are building a relationship on trying to change someone. That never turns out well.", "There\u2019s a difference between \u201cgiving someone an opportunity to try something new\u201d vs, \u201cpushing someone to do something new.\u201d\n\nYTA. Even with you writing this from your POV it is clear that you are not respecting his boundaries.", "INFO: why does he not like boats- does he have a phobia of the ocean/open water or something? I feel like it doesn\u2019t make much sense otherwise for him to dislike boats if he\u2019s never been on one before", "YTA you sound like a bully.", "I think YTA but probably not irredeemably so. I think Elise is just being protective of her brother but if you could just calmly explain to her that you aren\u2019t trying to change who Zack is, you just think it would be beneficial for him to broaden his horizons a little and convince her you actually have his best interests at heart, just as she does, she would relax a little.\n\nWhat will NOT help is being hostile against her, or trying to push too hard against Zack\u2019s boundaries if he\u2019s told you boats are a firm no. It will make you look selfish and bull-headed in both Elise\u2019s and Zack\u2019s eyes. And honestly, the mother comment was way out of line and you should apologise for that if nothing else. \n\nSo I think keep doing what you\u2019re doing if it\u2019s truly motivated in good faith, but do it gently and know when to back off. And try not to alienate Elise, even if you consider her to be \u2018in your business\u2019 nothing good will come of trying to get in between her and Zack as you\u2019ve already found out. Try to put yourself if her position instead and think about how you\u2019d feel if you felt a friend was being controlled or manipulated by a partner, because rightly or wrongly that\u2019s probably Elise\u2019s fear right now.", "NTA.

You are angry because he won't make his boundaries more flexible than he already has. this is a one sided exchange in which you either get what you want or you throw a fit.

Let me tell you a little story. \n\nMy husband is outgoing and social; I\u2019m a bit quiet and reserved. When my husband and I had been dating for a bit, because of our personalities, he was often surprised at all of the things I\u2019ve done that he\u2019d like to do. \n\nOne example: he loves cruises, and I said I wasn\u2019t really interested. By this he assumed I have never travelled, when in fact I\u2019ve been to every national park in the US and have visited almost every state. I\u2019ve hiked parts of the Appalachian trail and the Rocky Mountains. I\u2019ve looked over the Grand Canyon and watched Old Faithful. \n\nI have no interest in a cruise because it doesn\u2019t really seem like traveling to me. I don\u2019t like being on boats because I get motion sickness, but also because I don\u2019t like being confined in one space with a ton of people. In fact, I don\u2019t like being around a ton of people while doing unnatural \u201cfun\u201d activities. It\u2019s just not my thing, and that\u2019s okay; it doesn\u2019t bother me that he likes it. \n\nYou seem to think that your boyfriend is boring and does little of interest, and that your way of being is \u201cbetter\u201d instead of different. Why would you not choose an activity you\u2019re both interested in doing?  Why is your way the right way?\n\nBeyond that, you\u2019re wholly disrespectful of both his boundaries and his sister. In a very real way, she *was* his mother, and even if she didn\u2019t help raise him, you have no right to judge their relationship.", "o Sounds like he isn't ready to be a part of a relationship.  If you mattered to him, he wouldn't be asking his sister for permission.", "I get incredibly anxious in crowds and places that I know don't have a quick exit. I'm also very motion sick. So boats are a huge no for me. Yet so often people try to lecture me or convince me I just need to try a cruise. I hate it and I feel like I'm made to feel stupid for my very valid feelings and health concerns. \nSo YTA. Cruises aren't for everyone so let it go.", "YTA. Why do you want to change him? YTA for that and YTA for what you said to his sister. If you can\u2019t love him for who he is, why are you dating him?", "YTA - it's surprising you think that your thought process is reasonable....", "YTA, complaining that his sister thinks she knows better when in your mind you are the one that knows better.

Not everyone has a fraternity/sorority party mindset.", "YTA.\n\nHis sister was trying to get across an important point - that you were completely ignoring Zack's wants and needs. She's right; he shouldn't have to change just because YOU want him to. If you want a more outgoing guy who likes boats, find one.

Let me ask you this have you ever taken any interest in doing the things he enjoys have you ever done something out of your comfort zone for him? I'm guessing the answer to both of those is no.

I think that's something that you really need to learn.", "YTA\n\nSo, why do you want to change everything about your bf to be more like you? Why is your lifestyle so much greater than his?

Yes there\u2019s nothing wrong with sitting at home all the time, but it\u2019s good to try new things that way you know if you like them or not.
