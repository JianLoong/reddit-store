{"id": 8803, "submission_id": "10qe020", "title": "AITA for being \"disrespectful\" to my boyfriend's sister?", "selftext": "My (24F) boyfriend, \"Zack's\" (24M) mother passed away when he was 11 years old. His father worked a lot, so Zack's older sister, \"Elise\" (now 30F), basically became the \"woman of the house\" for lack of a better term. She cooked all the meals, cleaned the house, drove Zack to school and other activities, etc. She was extremely parentified and I do feel for her on that front. She went to a local college. Because of all this, Zack and Elise are very close, he has a lot of respect for her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nZack and I have dated for nearly a year. We are very different in terms of backgrounds. He is much more reserved than I am. Before me, he spent a lot of his weekends gaming or just hanging out with a small group of friends. I tend to go out. I work hard all week and want to enjoy the time I have off. Zack is a shy, somewhat nerdy guy and I do think I've broken him out of his shell a little, pushing him to do things out of his comfort zone. Elise and their father have made several comments about him changing. She's very nice and cordial when we see each other, but she's made several comments about Zack not needing to change who he is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSunday, Zack invited myself, some of his friends, his dad, sister, BIL and niece over to watch the game. At one point, vacations got brought up. I mentioned I was trying to convince him to go on a 2-day, local cruise with me as he's never been on one. Zack reminded me he's not the biggest fan of boats. I pointed out he's never been on one and we could rent one to take out so he could get used to it. He was somewhat on the fence. Myself and one of his buddies were trying to help him see it's not so bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nElise butted in and said \"If he doesn't want to go, then I'm sure you can find something else to do\". I said I was pretty sure I could talk him into it. She asked why I would want to go if he really didn't want to. I said of course I would never try to force him to go, but it's just something to think about. She repeated that he doesn't like boats and that I should respect that. I rolled my eyes, not really understanding why she was so adamant on this, and said she needed to relax, she's not his mother, she shouldn't care this much about the situation. Elise was clearly upset by the comment but didn't say anything else. The subject got changed and I thought all was well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA little later, Zack asked for my help getting something out of his room. Once in there, he told me I was out of line for how I spoke to his sister. I said she was the one that was getting up in our business. Zack said that I kept pushing it and got upset when I said, well clearly she and your dad didn't push you enough to try new things. He said I was being disrespectful and needed to apologize to Elise. I laughed and said no, she needs to butt out. Zack finally asked me to leave. I did, aggravated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really thought my friends would be on my side, but they said I crossed a line.

It's you deciding you know what he'll like better than he does and ignoring what he has to say. He's the one who should have spoken up, but likely didn't want to embarrass you by tell you to STFU. His sister stepped in to stop a bully. So yeah, YTA.", "YTA:\n\nYour boyfriend does not like boats. \n\nYour. Boyfriend. Does. Not. Like. Boats.\n\nIf it's clear that somebody doesn't want to do a particular vacation plan, you attempting to pressure him into it makes it extremely clear that this is a vacation for you not for the both of you. Find something you can both enjoy, which may or may not require you both stepping out of your comfort zone, but to a lesser degree than something one person has expressed a strong dislike of doing. Remember that not only is his sister not his mother (but she's extremely close to it) you are also not his mother.", "YTA\n\n>Zack reminded me he's not the biggest fan of boats.\n\nThis was him saying no to your idea and you kept pushing. It was good that he had his sister there to stop you because he doesn't seem to feel comfortable standing up to you. Perhaps because you keep pushing him out of his comfort zone when he doesn't want to be.", "YTA - So you brought up their dead mother......... Not a good look.", "YTA\n\nYou did cross a line. You got told something against what you wanted to do and then went to double down on it. When you didn\u2019t get any leighway you got attitude.\n\nShe\u2019s right though, why go on a whole ass cruise if he doesn\u2019t like boats? Start smaller. This seems more about you than him for a vacation sake.", "YTA.\n\n1. Badgering your partner to do things they don\u2019t want to do isn\u2019t \u2018breaking them out of their shell\u2019 it\u2019s harassing them into submission.\n\n2. You were rude AF to his sister who was merely sticking up for his interests.", "YTA\n He's said he doesn't want to go on a boat and your response is \"I'm going to keep pushing him until I get the answer I want\"\n\nYou don't even respect him, let alone his sister, who was standing up against you pressuring him", "YTA here. You definitely crossed the line given what you know about their past and the role she filled in his life. What you should've done was dropped the conversation in that moment, and continued it privately with him later.", "You\u2019re really TA here.  From a guy who\u2019s shy and more introverted, I understand the need to venture out of your comfort zone every once in a while, but publicly ganging up on him trying to change his mind will do the exact opposite. And the comment about Elise isn\u2019t his mother and how his dad and sister didn\u2019t push him enough was so out of line, and so tone deaf. They lost their mother, and at such young ages. I\u2019m 26 and I\u2019m dreading the day I lose mine. And what\u2019s the point of commenting that the sister went to community college? It obviously had no bearing on the situation. OP, an apology is needed for everyone in that family, like yesterday.", "YTA. She was advocating for her shy brother because she felt he was being badgered into something he wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about.\n\nIf you wanted him to consider it more, putting that pressure on him in a group setting isn\u2019t cool. I\u2019ve been pushed into doing things I don\u2019t like because I was in a group and didn\u2019t want to be the party pooper. I didn\u2019t appreciate it.\n\nYou\u2019d made your point. He wasn\u2019t unable to carry on thinking about it afterwards. You could have stopped talking and just left him to consider it. \n\nOn top of that, you then challenge his sister, roll your eyes at her - absurdly rude - and tell her \u201cyou\u2019re not his mother\u201d. His mother. Who is dead. Her mother. Then SHE had the good grace to cut the scenario short rather than make a further scene and you don\u2019t think you owe an apology for your rudeness and obliviousness?", "YTA\n\nWe tell women all the time that when a man is being pushy that \u201cNo,\u201d is a complete answer. This applies in reverse as well. When a man tells a woman no, that is his answer. If I saw someone badgering my bro/sis, along with a friend, after they\u2019d already declined, I\u2019d probably step in too, figuring the persistent request meant that perhaps the asker needed things explained simply and slowly.", "The moment you rolled your eyes like a child and told her shes not his mom was game over.

It seems like you're constantly pushing him to do things he wouldn't necessarily do otherwise, and I think this is not healthy. What's wrong with being shy and not wanting to do some things? Your way isn't the only correct way.\n\nAnd you did push him on this occasion too, and you _were_ being disrespectful to his sister.", "YTA \n\nIf I was a sibling and I saw their partner pressuring them to do something they didn't want to do, I'd have said something too.\n\nThe fact you continued to double down on this thing shows a lack of respect for Zack and his family.", "YTA. You were being pushy and not taking no for an answer. Elise called you out and you behaved like an immature brat. Honestly you sound like a bully. Date somebody who likes boats instead of bullying Zack into it. You owe Elise and Zach an apology.", "YTA Your not a girlfriend , your a control freak and don't be surprised if he brakes up with you\ncause you deserve it.", "YTA. He said no, you kept pushing and recruited a buddy to butt in (as you say) to help convince him. You immaturely rolled your eyes when his sister got involved to even the sides, then you reminded them that their mother is dead.", "YTA. Vacations should be enjoyable and relaxing for all parties involved. He doesn't like boats. So you pushing him to do what YOU like is an AH move. \n\nHis sister is right. Don't push him if he doesn't want to. Why do you insist on changing him?", "I'm with Zack on asking you to leave. You want to change someone? Change yourself into someone who accepts others for who they are and encourages them to grow when they can, not bullying them until they meet your standards for growth and change.\n\nApologise to Zack, his father, and sister. And then never pull this shit again. You'll lose long term. YTA", "Zack point blank told you you did something wrong and you\u2019re still wondering if you\u2019re the asshole?", "Yes, YTA. He was giving you clear signals that your suggestion didn't work for him, and you had to keep pushing. I'm not that surprised his sister stepped in to support him, since you didn't seem to be doing it.", "I assume you know that no means no?\n\nYeah YTA.", "YTA. You are being very pushy and aggressive. He already made it known to you that he does not like boats, so what is this nonsense about him having to speak up for himself? \n\nYou are the one who refuses to listen. And attacking the person who raised him? Do you really think that will get him to get on a boat?", "YTA, you acted like a brat, he was uncomfortable with your boat trip idea but you were pushy and you did disrespect his sister, I don't know if you haven't noticed, she actually acted as a mom to her younger brother and was there for him. You need to apologize to her", "YTA that was insensitive, disrespectful and rude AF. Their mother died. She took that motherly role. That comment was cruel. Zack needs the support to not do things as well.", "YTA. While it may sometimes be good for shy or withdrawn people to be encouraged to try something new, they still have the right to say no, or to refuse whatever you propose. You need to respect that and it doesn't seem like you do. You were aggressive and rude towards your bf's sister when she tried to point out that her brother doesn't like boats. Perhaps she knows her brother better than you do. There are, after all, lots of things people never do precisely because they know in advance they WON'T like it.", "YTA. Why are you even with him?

Repeat that till you figure it out", "INFO: you\u2019re clearly trying to change your boyfriend into someone you like/deem acceptable instead of loving him for who he is. Why are you dating someone you don\u2019t like or respect?", "please show your bf this post and your comments. you will be single by the end of the day!", "YTA. Now you can go on the boat by yourself", "YTA. \n\nI don\u2019t think you entirely like your boyfriend the way he is. Constantly having to convince (or, more bluntly, coerce) him to do what you want is not healthy. \n\nAnd you were disrespectful. His sister actually is the closest thing he has to a mother.", "YTA", "YTA - you could have brought the boat topic up in private. Why speak of it in front of her?", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t get to decide what her role is in your boyfriends life. The way you treated her was out of line and cruel. To be perfectly frank, why are you dating him? You don\u2019t agree with his relationship with his sister, he\u2019s too introverted and homebody-ish for you, and his family is correct\u2026you don\u2019t accept him for who he is. \n\nYou are spending a lot of time & energy trying to get him to do things he doesn\u2019t want to initially do. Even if he says it was fun afterwards, even if he loves it, you\u2019re still building a really unhealthy dynamic. You are building a relationship on trying to change someone. That never turns out well.", "There\u2019s a difference between \u201cgiving someone an opportunity to try something new\u201d vs, \u201cpushing someone to do something new.\u201d\n\nYTA. Even with you writing this from your POV it is clear that you are not respecting his boundaries.", "INFO: why does he not like boats- does he have a phobia of the ocean/open water or something? I feel like it doesn\u2019t make much sense otherwise for him to dislike boats if he\u2019s never been on one before", "YTA you sound like a bully.", "I think YTA but probably not irredeemably so. I think Elise is just being protective of her brother but if you could just calmly explain to her that you aren\u2019t trying to change who Zack is, you just think it would be beneficial for him to broaden his horizons a little and convince her you actually have his best interests at heart, just as she does, she would relax a little.\n\nWhat will NOT help is being hostile against her, or trying to push too hard against Zack\u2019s boundaries if he\u2019s told you boats are a firm no. It will make you look selfish and bull-headed in both Elise\u2019s and Zack\u2019s eyes. And honestly, the mother comment was way out of line and you should apologise for that if nothing else. \n\nSo I think keep doing what you\u2019re doing if it\u2019s truly motivated in good faith, but do it gently and know when to back off. And try not to alienate Elise, even if you consider her to be \u2018in your business\u2019 nothing good will come of trying to get in between her and Zack as you\u2019ve already found out. Try to put yourself if her position instead and think about how you\u2019d feel if you felt a friend was being controlled or manipulated by a partner, because rightly or wrongly that\u2019s probably Elise\u2019s fear right now.", "NTA.

And probably single soon.", "All your friends say YTA and even Reddit says YTA", "He did try to say something! You just weren\u2019t listening.", "You always have a fun time. Are you sure he does or is he placating you? Maybe you should talk to him about how he feels about you pushing his boundaries constantly.", "Jesus. You're not there to fix him. This relationship is headed for doneski-ville.", "Because it is wrong. No is no.", "You are a walking red flag, stop that. It is not cute, funny, or a good thing that you do this, stop it.", "So not only did you insult his older sister (whom took on a motherly roll) but also their dead mom. Class act.", "Arrogant and thoughtless...", "Insensitive AF", "It's not a compromise if you're badgering him. Try listening.", "What part of **HE DOESNT LIKE BOATS** do you not understand??", "YOU wanted to go on a bigger cruise. \nYOU felt less anxiety. \n\nEverything is all just about you. You never even considered Zack's feelings.", "YOU feel less anxiety.  Can you not see that you are being self-absorbed here?", "\u201cBecause she only did that to stay close to home to and help their dad tend to zack, which wasn\u2019t her place\u201d wasnt her place? My god, HER MOTHER DIED, of course it\u2019s her place! She was grieving as well! How is it not her place to be close to her own family at a time like that?", "It was the place she was in.  You are awful", "Who are you to tell them what her place is? You\u2019re not in their family, you have no say in the dynamics. You need to back off", "It sounds very much like you resent anyone else who has influence on him because you want to be the only one influencing him, and you have clear goals for what you want of him, which are contrary to what he wants. \n\nYTA, and worse than that, I find it concerning that you perceive other people he cares for as a threat to your position. That kind of thinking leads to you trying to isolate him from those people. \n\nThat is abusive behavior. I really hope this thread wakes you up to your own behavior, but so far what I'm reading is that you still think you're in the right for wanting him away from them.", "Holy- the audacity??? Not her place to be there for her family???? Who. Are. You. To. Say. What. Her. Place. Is.", "Holy shit this comment is awful.  How's your relationship with your family?  Not great would be my guess, or you're  spoiled rotten.", "What\u2019s not healthy is being in a relationship with an overbearing partner who\u2019s constantly trying to change you.", "This attitude - who the heck are you to arbitrarily decide what he's capable of and then pushing him until he does what you want? He's not growing visibly in the ways you want him to, so he must be doing nothing! \n\nYour arrogance is astounding.", "Sure, he's capable of, he just doesn't want to.\n\nWhy is it not healthy to keep doing the same old he loves?\n\nSeems like you want to shape him into what you want him to be instead of accepting him the way he is. I'm not saying people shouldn't accommodate their partners wishes when possible, but this seems way more than this.\n\nThink about it this way. What if he decided your going out and partying is too much, and needed to stay home and play video games instead. Would you like that?", "Your response cements it. YTA through and through.", ">It's not healthy to be stuck doing the same old, same old.\n\nIt's actually perfectly healthy if you're happy.", "You do know that there are many new, exciting activities that don\u2019t involve boats, right?!", "You  being pushy and can't take a hint is not healthy and makes you TA.", "Agreed. \n\nSounds like it\u2019s time for him to branch out and find a new relationship. It\u2019s not healthy to waste his 20\u2019s clinging to the same old, same old.\n\nHe\u2019s missing out!", "Now, have you considered that he ventured out because of the fact you keep pushing him, and he wanted to get you to stop? Have you considered YOU might be the issue? I know plenty of people, those who love going out, on vacations, willing to try new things, etc. But there are some people who genuinely enjoy doing the same old, same old, who don't want to get on cruises, airplanes, etc and that's absolutely fine. I think you and Zack aren't compatible when it comes to this, and yes, YTA in this situation. You kept pushing him in front of his family, and I'm glad they spoke up. Also, you could have just told his sister that she needs to mind her business, you had no right to bring up her not being his mother, knowing their situation.", "No means no, but you don't accept that, OP, and you keep pushing and pushing. It is draining and disheartening to be told or shown by a partner that you're not good enough and need to fix a laundry list of issues.\n\nBoth partners should grow in a successful relationship. That would mean that in addition to your boyfriend going out with you, OP would happily stay in with him doing things he enjoys. Doesn't sound like that is happening. \n\nYTA - self-focused. Either come to a mutual agreement of what the relationship looks like or set him free.", "There have been things I've let go on. He didn't want to try certain things when we went clubbing and I let it go instantly. I do push a little more when it comes to trips or other activities because they're harmless. Though, if he truly seems like he doesn't want to, I let it go. I felt with the boat, he was wishy washy on whether or not he wanted to do it.", "Lmao. She wouldn't listen. \"He was smiling\" That's enough for her. She doesn't hear when he says No several times in a row. She just wants to do what she wants.", "Don't forget pushy. Whole-ass adults don't need to be \"broken out of their shells\" or \"pushed out of their comfort zones\". What is it about extroverts that they feel like being an introvert is somehow a form of brokenness or something that needs to be \"corrected\"? The dude is entitled to have likes and dislikes, and have his partner respect them. It sounds like his sister is just trying to point out that OP doesn't actually like him for who he is at all . . .she just wants to make him more like herself.", "Even brick walls break down if you hit it enough. Yep.", "He didn't think he'd like clubbing either, but we had a good time when we went and he's gone a couple of times since then. I didn't think this would be different.", "I feel sorry for her. I can't imagine giving up my teen years/early 20s to take care of a pre-teen. Their dad shouldn't have allowed that to happen and should've figured it out on his own vs depending on his teenager/young adult daughter.", "I am very close with my family as well.  My brother wouldn't have dared to interfere with our conversation. But my parents also raised us to worry about ourselves.", "When we started dating, he said he was willing to try new things. It's why I agreed to go out with him. So no, I wouldn't be complacent with doing things lowkey all the time like he'd want to.", "Um.. so what were the non-harmless activities he didn't want to try?", "My guess is your idea of a good time is different than his. He probably is trying to make you happy, but that\u2019s not sustainable. You two are not compatible.", "You can leave a club, you can\u2019t exactly step off a boat in the middle of the water", "So the dad isn\u2019t allowed to have been grieving the loss of his wife, dealing with all the legal and other paperwork, while trying to figure out how to now raise two children on his own, at a time when one is about to go to college, as a widower? OP, do you have *any* empathy for your boyfriend\u2019s family?", "Omg now the dad. This is endless. It's too bad they didn't get a copy of your guide on \"How to Properly Grieve and Get Thru Devastating Loss\".", "She stuck up for her brother when you clearly weren't listening.", "So... this relationship is contingent upon him changing the way you want him to?\n\nI guess... good luck?", "So you only agreed to date him if he'd become someone other than who he actually is? Well that's gross. Maybe go find yourself someone to date who you actually value for themselves?", "You two aren\u2019t compatible. That\u2019s just how it is. He thought he\u2019d be willing to, but clearly he isn\u2019t comfortable with this. You need to respect that. But, if that\u2019s what you need in a relationship, move on.", "Then you are not compatible and you need to end things with him and find someone more your speed.  Because you don\u2019t love him for who he is; you love the person you want him to be, and you\u2019ll never make him that person.  Leave now while you still have some dignity and goodwill left with him.\n\nYTA", "yes, some new things, doesnt mean you have to force him to do whatever you want all the time", "He's rejected certain sexual positions I've wanted to try and certain roleplay. In the club, he didn't want to try certain alcohol nor smoke weed. He stuck to one beer the whole night, which I respected.", "I have empathy for them, especially my boyfriend and his sister. But it doesn't change Elise was heavily parentified and shouldn't have been. She could act less like a mom and more like a fun sister if she didn't have so much put on her. And maybe then Zack would feel more comfortable breaking out of his shell.", "I love him and he's a really sweet guy. I just set the boundary early on that we'd have to have some adventures and not just stick to what's comfortable. He's the one that agreed to it.", ".. I find it horrifying how you feel respecting him only wanting one beer - or accepting that he doesn't want to do certain sexual things is a sign you take what he wants into consideration bc you don't push. Rather than looking at that as the bare basics of being a decent human being? So.. I guess congrats you don't sexualy assault or or force him to do drugs?", "I\u2019m trying to see how those things aren\u2019t \u201charmless\u201d", "Girl, stop saying \"breaking out of his shell\" when you really mean \"acts the way I want him to\"", "OP, it certainly does not come off that way. You\u2019re skirting around the main problem *everyone* in this thread is having: *you* are very much acting like *you* know what\u2019s best for zack, and are coming off as feeling threatened by anyone else in his life. Even when *he explicitly told you* to apologize to his sister, *you said yourself* that you got upset and left in a public manner.", "That's not a boundary, you are quite pushy.", "You sound exhausting.", "There\u2019s a difference between fun little adventures and things like 2 day cruises.  I don\u2019t know what other activities you\u2019ve encouraged him to do with you, but if they are often like multi day stays away or very loud or socially exhausting, for an introvert, that is so tiring without enough rest space in between, which varies for people.  I\u2019m an introvert.  I can easily spend tons of time in my own company.  I do really enjoy going out and adventuring.  Picnics, movies, finding a random museum, club night are all fun and great.  But if I go hard at a club, I\u2019m good for a month.  You might need to find yourself another extrovert.", "Ok \u201csome\u201d adventures but that has to mean you will also have to stay home sometimes too, how often would you be willing to do that? \nAlso, getting on a boat takes a lot, ive done it 3-4 times and i still wouldnt go on a cruise because thats way different than an afternoon on a boat", "OP may not have used the right word. Perhaps expectation would have worked better. And if he agreed to it, who are any of us to say otherwise? It is not a bad thing to help your partner to experience new things. \n\nOP is TA for the comment she made to his sister about not being his mom, even if factually correct - it is insensitive. However, it is not inherently a bad thing to encourage your partner to try new things. If my partner had never been on a boat, I would encourage him to experience it with me. My partner has bad motion sickness, we went on a boat, his motion sickness flared up and we got off. I would not ask him to do it again, but he tried."]}
