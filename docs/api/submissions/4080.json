They've been together for a little over six years and married for about four now. Dad was a widower when they met. I'm 16f and my siblings are 14f and 12m. Our mom died 8 years ago. Jani has not adjusted well to being a stepparent. I think she thought she would be just a parent to us because our mom had died and didn't consider that we'd still talk about and have photos of mom. Over the years she has been to therapy and her and my dad have gone to couples sessions. In the last year the five of us have gone to family therapy and she has admitted it's hard for her because she feels like she's second best or a consolation to us and that we don't really love and want her. Dad assured her that \\*we\\* all love her just as much as mom, that she's his number one and is vital to our family.\n\nFor a while then in sessions she and the therapist would talk about how she feels like she's not a true member of the family, like she's a second class member, not someone we see as important in the structure of the family. She said she never felt love from any of us and she feels like even extended family, which she explicitly said was grandparents and any aunts and uncles, come before her when it comes to us kids. She said she sees it in so many things including the way we don't regard her parents as our grandparents or her two sisters as our aunts and how when I turned 16 and we did a nice dinner party, my guest list included both my mom and dad's sides of the family but not her side.\n\nMy sister was the first to speak during all this and she said nothing was ever done to make her feel bad. That she just doesn't think of her as her mom or as being her parent. Once that was said she was talking about how much that makes her feel bad and like she's not truly accepted. The therapist asked us to consider whether we'd be willing to deepen the relationship so she felt equally as loved and important as our dad and dad wanted us to consider ditching our typical Christmas dynamic and spend the time with her parents exclusively this year. Then three weeks ago she brought up that I had made something for class that went into details on my family and she pointed out that she and her family were not mentioned. Then she asked me why my grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins were mentioned on both sides, all with their own pages, but I couldn't make room for the most important woman in my life (her). I told her because she is not the most important woman in my life. I told her that will always be my mom, followed by both my grandma's. She asked if she was just second best then, if she was unimportant and I refused to answer. Afterward my dad and Jani both told me that I was cruel to say she wasn't the most important woman in my life when she is there every day and has done her best.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670327690, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ze4nud/aita_for_telling_my_stepmother_shes_not_the_most/", "score": 3760, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I also didn't want the fact that my kiddo has a dead mom to be a huge part of their childhood which should be as carefree as possible.  I have also tried to make sure the kiddo gets to spend time with some of the extended family on the maternal side, with the exception of one family who has already engaged in harmful behavior to the kiddo directly.

Rather than trying to replace your mom, your stepmother should focus on building her own relationship with you and your siblings.\n\nAnd also, if she wants to be a parent, she need to internalize this one big lesson: it's not about what the parent needs from the child, but what the child needs from the parent.

Step mom has been around since you were 8 and saw you through so much literally from crayons to perfume, she does deserve more respect. She is working and spending her money to help elevate your quality of life vs a single parent income, you never say she was abusive but do list all the reasons and validate they are accurate she does not feel equal and welcome In the house after all these years. Blood is not everything and my step grand parents were awesome. I couldn\u2019t imagine not inviting them to my family bday dinner.

My dad is one of seven children and his mom died early in their life, not so different from you and your siblings when you lost your mother.  I think it\u2019s been 50 years for them, and I can tell you that after all of this time, there is still friction from time to time over the issue. Personally, I think my grandmother must be a saint. She married into a family with seven young children, and never had any of her own, and she loved all of them like a mother. She smiled proudly as grandpa would say that he felt fortunate to be married to two of the most wonderful women he\u2019s ever met.

How could they not be? We all watched as she sacrificed her own health to do everything for grandpa as he died in the hospital. \n\nBut none of this was easy for them. There is one sibling who has essentially cut off contact with the whole family over tensions regarding the stepmother. She tried to be a wedge that drove the family apart, and grandpa wouldn\u2019t have it. Most recently there were tensions over disposal of the family house and belongings. Decisions needed made about keepsakes and memorabilia that dealt with the other side of the family. \nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way to do this without some kind of tension, but ultimately everybody should remember that you are a family and everybody is trying their best. Eventually, the small stuff will blow over.\n\nI\u2019m telling you this because I want you to realize that her job is very difficult also.

My mom is alive and well and we have an amazing relationship. My SM is less than 2 years older than me with no children of her own. She had previously made comments about being excited to finally have children (meaning my sister and myself) - we thought she was playing around due to the nonexistent age gap between us.  She was married to my father when I was 23, my sister was 22, SM was 25, and my father was 55 (the age gap between them is a for sure an issue, but unrelated to this topic). \n\nAfter their wedding she started referring to us as her daughters to everyone, including people who have known us our entire lives. Even going so far as to not correct people when they commented things like, \u201cYou look so great to have children that old!\u201d. The first Mother\u2019s Day after their wedding, I received a furious call from my father for not calling SM and wishing her a happy Mother\u2019s Day nor getting her a gift of some kind in appreciation of her and \u201call she\u2019s done\u201d for me. At that point I had known her for a less than a year and had only met her a few times. There was no relationship and she had never done anything for me in regards to raising or rearing me. Keep in mind this woman is literally 22 months older than me. \n\nA few months later my sister was visiting them during her summer break from college. My mother lives in a different state but the three of us were very close at the time. We had a group text that we communicated in daily and had individual and Group FaceTime calls several times/week. I wasn\u2019t there for this incident but apparently SM had an absolute fit that my sister was communicating with her biological mother in front of SM. She was crying, screaming, and acting hysterical. From what my sister told me, SM wanted no mention of our mother and banned my sister from calling/texting her for the remainder of the visit. SM was upset because we (sister and I) don\u2019t communicate with her as much as we communicate with our own mother, we don\u2019t call her mom, and we don\u2019t tell her we love her. This is absurd as we barely knew the woman and she\u2019s our age. SM went so far as to remove every picture of our family that included my mom in my father\u2019s house, replacing them with VERY scantily clad sexy pictures of herself. My dad sided with SM and didn\u2019t understand why we couldn\u2019t just call her mom to appease her. After that incident I decided to go no contact. \n\nIdk where I\u2019m going with this honestly. Just wanted to say you\u2019re not at fault for your stepmom having these feelings. Your mother may have passed on but she\u2019s still your mother and will ALWAYS be your mother regardless of the women your dad decides to be romantic with.", "NTA. \n\nWhy are the adults (including the therapist!) trying to force these children to consider stepmother's feelings as more important than their own?

I encourage them to talk about her, I ask loads of questions about her, discuss ways to honour her and keep parts of her alive in their lives going forward (ie- Christmas decorations that got damaged- make new ones with salvageable pieces of the old ones so that you can keep parts and carry them forward into their own families in future, however that family dynamic looks cause neither of them wants kids or spouses lol) \nI truly wish I had gotten to know her.  I feel we would have gotten along fabulously, and they one hundred percent know that I value their mom and the children she raised, exactly as they are.

Perhaps talking about your mom would help, too, to let her know that at the end of the day, no one can ever replace your mom and you miss her dearly (plus maybe opening up the conversation so that you both start feeling more comfortable talking about your mom and her family), but also that you do need a motherly figure and would like to extend that to her. Again just an idea, take it with a grain of salt, but it sounds like in addition to her unrealistic expectations and possible issues with the therapist that others have mentioned, there might truly be a disconnect. I can see where she may think that after so many years and you having been so young when she passed, especially if she never went though something like that, you \"should just be ready to move on,\" but we all know that that just isn't quite how it works.

Jani\u2019s feelings of being ostracized more than likely stems from something in her childhood like neglect, abuse, etc. There\u2019s a reason (or two) why she\u2019s so grossly insecure.

She\u2019s gotta learn healthy boundaries and not take them as a personal attack.", "If she is not, that is nothing the family might change. You cannot force the love into someone, specially if she already had a mom. She died, but she was her mom. \nThe stepmother can be doing her ultimate best and still does not mean she can just force herself into their lives as \u201cthe most important women in their lives\u201d just because she wants to. \nNTA. Your dad also needs to sit down and set some boundaries with her. Him allowing this is absolutely will-lacky of him. He should explain that his ex is still their mother and she should not step over her just because she has low self-esteem. That is not the kids\u2019 problem.", "I\u2019m really upset at this therapist. Wtf dude?! They need to tell the stepmom she can\u2019t force a relationship. That these kids lost their mom so young. And need to be allowed to keep her in their lives and that her expectations are way too much. \nOP NTA. I\u2019m so sorry you lost your mom so young. That\u2019s a huge trauma. Your feelings are valid. Lost mine also 8 years ago and I was 33. It was traumatic for me but I feel when you\u2019re young it\u2019s gotta be so much harder", "NTA. I get the sense that Step-mom shopped around until she found the therapist who told her what she wanted to hear. \n\nObviously kids are capable of having deep relationships with step-parents, but her feeling entitled to being your number 1, superseding you deceased mother, is disgusting. And your father has let you down deeply by agreeing and enabling this behavior.", "NTA. A new therapist is definitely needed. Based on what you are saying above, it sounds this therapist does not know what they are doing.", "Nope - they need someone new pronto. The more established Jani gets with her unrealistic expectations of trying to replace mom, the more difficult it'll be for her to get out of that mindset. NTA", "THIS. Jani needs to understand her role as step-mom. Her current therapy isn't helping her with this at all, but instead encouraging her to do the opposite, trying to replace your mom. She'd be so much happier if she could just accept that nothing will ever replace your deceased mom and she shouldn't be competing with her as she'll always lose.", "Imagine telling someone they're an asshole because no one will replace their parent in their heart.  I've been the step parent.  I never expected my step kids to treat me the same as their bio dad, because (spoiler alert) I wasn't their bio dad.

People seem to forget there's a dozen ways to say the same thing, some mean the same thing some don't. And that's not even getting into variations of tone and non verbal communication", "Your family therapist is a hack and not doing their job. They should be addressing SMs unhealthy and obsessive desire to replace your mother despite you all not wanting or needing that.\n\nThe therapist is hyperfocused on SMs feelings and ignoring all of the children's feelings. They're also encouraging SM to stomp on and violate healthy boundaries.\n\nI would personally refuse to keep seeing this therapist and push for someone who will actually do their job and tell SM the brutal truth: she is not a replacement for your mother and has acted as nothing more than your dad's second wife. She has done nothing to earn a material spot in your lives, instead choosing to demand it because she feels entitled to it.", "I think we should change the name of step parent to something else that doesn\u2019t include \u201cparent\u201d unless the person came into kid\u2019s life before 5. Because you\u2019re not a parent after that automatically. You might be close. Maybe. But you\u2019re just not. And if you are, let that kid initiate the word. Too many people see that role as an authority figure and demand the relationship that a bio parent has. Ugh", "Thanks for sharing your insight as a professional. I don't see how its possible for OP's dad and step-mom to insist that step-mom now be the most important person in OP and her sister's life. Makes no sense.  NTA", "I agree. She needs a therapist who can help her accept and adjust to being Dad\u2019s wife only, and not family to the children.", "As long as no one expects stepmom to take on mom\u2019s responsibilities. I\u2019ve seen it too many times- oh you\u2019re not a REAL parent, but please take the kids to swimming, do their laundry, and cook their dinner. Oh yeah, you need to financially support these children that aren\u2019t yours too. Being a stepparent can be rough. Gotta set some boundaries!  Can\u2019t have it both ways.", "Exactly this! The problem is the stepparents that try this are so obsessed with taking on the role of parent and receiving immediate validation of the position but it's just not possible/healthy. They need to actually bond with the kids but that takes work/time.\n\nI got a stepmom when I was 23 and she came with 2 stepsisters who are older than me. Nobody tried to force anything though. We spent time together and made efforts to develop relationships. 5 years later: I can't say I see them exactly the same as I do my sister I grew up with but we're good friends. I consider them family and to the older step-sisters kids I feel like a full fledged aunt. Cause I put in the hours. \n\nStepmom needs to see a better therapist and rework her mindset/approach. She's really wasting time that could be spent strengthening the family bond she so desperately wants. OP and her siblings aren't gonna want to participate in all this drama once they move out.", "Yes these kids are bloody awesome!!! I\u2019m waaaaaaaay older with similar issues and have never spoken up. I just take the crap. But wow! These kids are speaking up. I\u2019m so proud of these kids. I\u2019m sure if there\u2019s an afterlife their mom is looking down on them beaming with pride.", "Exactly. And the kids didn\u2019t marry the step parent the bio parent did. You cannot expect anything but civility. Great if you all get along but it shouldn\u2019t be expected.", "It's not a unique story either. There was generally a small handful of counsellors whose \"bedside manner\" left alot to be desired. One lady was super nice but came off really aggressive and she made this guy cry one day by just being a hard ass with the rules. We chatted and about it because on the outside looking in it seemed really harsh and she took that to heart at least and lightened up a bit and even called the guy to come back and finish his appointment. I think sometimes we get caught up in being right we lose sight of what actually matters in the situation and sometimes being right isn't what matters.", "Or maybe therapy isn't the magic bullet reddit likes to pretend it is.  \nJust like any medical procedure won't have a 100% success rate, neither does therapy.", ">They don't see people with feelings...they only see roles.

Some are and feel the lack of having a father or mother figure keenly. Others don't care, they've got one parent already they're good.", "Hoping on to say, as a stepmom, I get where Janies feelings are coming from in regards to feeling somewhat invalidated or taken for granted. But Jesus, Mary and Joseph it is NOT up to children to validate my feelings or handle my emotions because I'M AN ADULT who choose to be with someone with children whom I've grown to love very much, but I'm not their mom nor will I ever replace their mother in any way, shape or form. And why should the kids care about my parents/grandparents, etc, they are not related! \n\nWhoever this therapist is, they are not holding the children's best interests at heart when having a group session with step-mom putting such emotional baggage on these kids and then not addressing it.\n\nMy step kiddos had a family tree project in elementary and one choose to include me on it and the other didn't. Did I blow up on her? Did I challenge her and demand I be added? Fuck no, because she's literally a child and honestly either didn't even consider it because we weren't officially married at the time, OR didn't consider me family or for whatever reason just wanted to get the damn thing done. \n\nWhat is happening with this sub and stepparents lately?!", "As a dad who remarried, my 2nd wife said she was gonna be a cool step mom. And was she ever! Taught my son to cook to try new foods, enjoy travel and broaden horizons. My son had parents - but my wife opened the world to him.", "Honestly, any time the therapist brings up a disconnect between your feelings and the desired ones, I'd ask her, \"Are you asking me what I feel or telling me what to feel?\" She'll probably say that she's trying to open you up to the possibility to change what you feel, to which you can respond, \"That sounds like telling me what to feel.  Please tell me the difference.\" If she says the difference is that the change must come from you and/or be voluntary, you can say you're not ready for, can't make, and don't consent to such a change at this point, and might never be able to do so.\n\nI'd also be blunt with everyone and say that anyone trying to force, cajole, or otherwise manipulate you to feel, say, or do something contrary to your core will backfire, only making you more and more guarded and entrenched in your feelings.  If they want you to feel close, whining about how it's such a shame you don't will only backfire.", "NTA \n\nUnfortunately, parents who act like this, like your dad, don't realize their actions are hurtful. They think you'll just love her anyway. But she's a stranger (not really but really). Not to him, but she is to you. He just hopes you see her, how he sees her, but he's missing a huge part of it, in that you will never see her that way and that you lost something you loved and nothing can replace it. My dad was similar. He wanted us to get along and be a family, almost instantly, with his new wife and step daughter whom we didn't know. That's hard on a young child. My sister had it easier since the step daughter was her age. I however did not and I was still struggling with the divorce of my parents. That step mom has validation issues and needs to work on herself and realize that she will possibly never be the replacement your dad wants her to be and unfortunately keeps enabling the behavior.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this.

(if she *isnt* or is bad to them then that\u2019s a whole other thing.) but if she\u2019s been caring for them as her own and doing mom duties for four *years* isnt it normal to feel bummed that her stepchildren aren\u2019t even willing to include her in a report specifically about their family? \n\ni give OP lots of grace here because she lost her mother young & she\u2019s still young. but i don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to act like the step-mom is neurotic for being treated this way\n\nthe only thing i can see that was an AH move on the stepmoms part is saying \u201cmost important woman in your life\u201d. that\u2019s reasonably absurd. & maybe that\u2019s why OP is resistant, maybe this is an attitude that she\u2019s had from the beginning of their relationship. that would make a little more sense to me. \n\nbut still i think the step-mom is just looking for some kind of acknowledgment. she\u2019s in a painful position", "Apparently step mom isn't a person and she's not allowed to make mistakes, I apologize for not suggesting OP run away and go NC from her dad and stepmonster and make her own way in life at 16 like this sub seems to always jump to.\n\nThis is why I rarely ever comment on a minor's submission on here.

My grandmother died when my mother was 25 and she always told us stories about her life growing up. She just kinda rolled her eyes about her father\u2019s next wife. The connection has to be unforced and natural. This woman has unrealistic expectations and is pushing too hard.", "She doesn\u2019t have the title \u201cmom\u201d even if they were close.

They\u2019ve literally gone to family therapy to make her feel better. Having unrealistic expectations about how her step kids feel about her and being incredibly insecure isn\u2019t a mistake like forgetting to pick the kids up from soccer. It\u2019s a personality issue that she needs to actually address in therapy. Because apparently all the therapy she\u2019s done has made her make zero progress in those areas so she\u2019s either unwilling to do what the therapist says or just ignores their advice and continues to feel victimized for these kids not meeting her unrealistic expectations", "I genuinely think stepparents aren\u2019t considered as people with actual feelings on this sub.
