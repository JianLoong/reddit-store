They've been together for a little over six years and married for about four now. Dad was a widower when they met. I'm 16f and my siblings are 14f and 12m. Our mom died 8 years ago. Jani has not adjusted well to being a stepparent. I think she thought she would be just a parent to us because our mom had died and didn't consider that we'd still talk about and have photos of mom. Over the years she has been to therapy and her and my dad have gone to couples sessions. In the last year the five of us have gone to family therapy and she has admitted it's hard for her because she feels like she's second best or a consolation to us and that we don't really love and want her. Dad assured her that \\*we\\* all love her just as much as mom, that she's his number one and is vital to our family.\n\nFor a while then in sessions she and the therapist would talk about how she feels like she's not a true member of the family, like she's a second class member, not someone we see as important in the structure of the family. She said she never felt love from any of us and she feels like even extended family, which she explicitly said was grandparents and any aunts and uncles, come before her when it comes to us kids. She said she sees it in so many things including the way we don't regard her parents as our grandparents or her two sisters as our aunts and how when I turned 16 and we did a nice dinner party, my guest list included both my mom and dad's sides of the family but not her side.\n\nMy sister was the first to speak during all this and she said nothing was ever done to make her feel bad. That she just doesn't think of her as her mom or as being her parent. Once that was said she was talking about how much that makes her feel bad and like she's not truly accepted. The therapist asked us to consider whether we'd be willing to deepen the relationship so she felt equally as loved and important as our dad and dad wanted us to consider ditching our typical Christmas dynamic and spend the time with her parents exclusively this year. Then three weeks ago she brought up that I had made something for class that went into details on my family and she pointed out that she and her family were not mentioned. Then she asked me why my grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins were mentioned on both sides, all with their own pages, but I couldn't make room for the most important woman in my life (her). I told her because she is not the most important woman in my life. I told her that will always be my mom, followed by both my grandma's. She asked if she was just second best then, if she was unimportant and I refused to answer. Afterward my dad and Jani both told me that I was cruel to say she wasn't the most important woman in my life when she is there every day and has done her best.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670327690, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ze4nud/aita_for_telling_my_stepmother_shes_not_the_most/", "score": 332, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I also didn't want the fact that my kiddo has a dead mom to be a huge part of their childhood which should be as carefree as possible.  I have also tried to make sure the kiddo gets to spend time with some of the extended family on the maternal side, with the exception of one family who has already engaged in harmful behavior to the kiddo directly.

Rather than trying to replace your mom, your stepmother should focus on building her own relationship with you and your siblings.\n\nAnd also, if she wants to be a parent, she need to internalize this one big lesson: it's not about what the parent needs from the child, but what the child needs from the parent.

Step mom has been around since you were 8 and saw you through so much literally from crayons to perfume, she does deserve more respect. She is working and spending her money to help elevate your quality of life vs a single parent income, you never say she was abusive but do list all the reasons and validate they are accurate she does not feel equal and welcome In the house after all these years. Blood is not everything and my step grand parents were awesome. I couldn\u2019t imagine not inviting them to my family bday dinner. Also as you get older you will want and need a maternal figure and some day you might have kids and you will want her to be grandma so your kids will have one. Gotta be honest you are being disrespectful and this is coming from someone who is in your shoes although by now my step mom is dead also. You need to do some reflection. Yta", "Wtf???? The therapist should\u2019ve telling this woman that she shouldn\u2019t rely on validation *from fucking children*. She wants to completely replace your deceased mother and her family, and you dad is okay with this????\n\nY\u2019all need a better therapist. NTA.", "NTA, and I\u2019d have a couple of questions for the next group session ready. For the therapist, I\u2019d ask why do they think it\u2019s acceptable to place the burden of a fully grown adult\u2019s fragile ego on three (literal) children? \n\n\nTo Jani I\u2019d ask, how do feel about being the person responsible for the breakdown of a loving relationship between a father and his kids? Because that\u2019s the environment she\u2019s creating right now. If it\u2019s not you, it might be one of your siblings that goes no contact once they\u2019re 18 years of age if she continues.", "NTA. But I\u2019d report that therapist to whatever board exists in your country. They shouldn\u2019t have a license. You all need a new therapist.", "NTA. Your stepmom needs to realize that she is just that, a stepmom, she will never be your parent, you already have parents. Just because your mom is gone doesn\u2019t make her any less of a parent to you. This therapist seems terrible.", "NTA. Ask her how she would feel if she were so easily replaced by someone else. Loyalty is a virtue. Continued love for your mother's memory should show her that her memory would also be valued.", "NTA \n\nThese \"group\" therapy sessions sound gross. It sounds more like a session for everyone to try to give Jani what Jani wants. It sounds like the therapist is only concerned about Jani and not the family unit that involves children who lost a mother! \n\nI'm so sorry you're being forced into this position. You and your siblings have a right to your own feelings about your mother and your extended family. It honestly has nothing to do with Jani. \n\nHer expectations are unrealistic. Relationships aren't instant. Perhaps with time you would grow fond of her, but that doesn't mean you would just stop missing or loving your own mother!\n\nI find it so odd that a grown adult is more concerned with how much her stepchildren love her rather than the well being of those stepchildren. Don't let her take away your relationship with extended family.", "A well-adjusted blended family comes together organically. And very few stepparents seem to realize that 'forcing' the issue almost inevitably breeds resentment.\n\nNTA but until she's willing to see that she's her own worst enemy not a hell of alot will change.", "NTA\n\nshe needs a new therapist who will dig in and find out why she needs validation from children. She went into this thing SO unprepared. It's not the kids' job to validate the step-parent. It's the adults' jobs to love the kids the best they can, so the kids can start feeling the connection. She will never be your mom, and she has to accept that. \n\nSo maybe she can be an auntie figure, or a mentor or something - those are respectable relationships to have with step-kids. \n\nI hope everybody gets the therapy they need.", "Think you put your mom on a pedestal and need to have some grace and compassion for the person doing the work in raising you? Yta", "NTA", "NTA.  Jani seems to think she\u2019s a replacement for your mother and she is not.  She is your father\u2019s wife.  She can\u2019t force you to feel like a particular way.  And she wants you to spend Christmas with her parents exclusively?  That sounds uncomfortable for you and your siblings. Can you go to your grandparents while your dad and Jani go to her parents?", "NTA\n\nMove in with grandparents until this woman can chill the f out.", "NTA- this seems pretty common on this sub and it's so weird to me. Like, accept the dynamic. You cannot force these kinds of relationships on people and the more you push the more they will pull away. You grew up with such a hard loss at such an early age and you feel loyal to your mother and mothers side and that is completely fine and acceptable. Your feeling are valid OP! And an adults emotional issues are not your problem! Merry Christmas kiddo", "NTA. Jani's been there 6 years. Your mother was there for the most formative 10. She needs to curb her expectations.", "NTA. It sounds like the therapist is really focused on changing you and yiur siblings mindset instead of helping the stepmom accept that she going to get the same maternal adoration from you all as your mom did. Therapy isn't supposed to be about someone forcing everyone to make them happy.", "NTA.  There is no point to therapy if you aren\u2019t being honest.  A step-mother has unrealistic expectations if she thinks she will be number one and even more important than your birth mother.  You are the child and she is the adult.  She needs to grow up and face reality about the situation.     \n\n\nI suspect you have some repressed anger about your mother\u2019s death.  You may be directing it at her since she has been in a mother role.   Loss of a parent is a significant childhood trauma.   You may want to get some therapy yourself.  Remember that words can do tremendous damage.  Do you want to hurt her?  Will you feel good if her demeanor toward you becomes cold?  You can love your mom and still be kind to your step-mother.", "NTA. Your stepmom can be important and vital without trying to replace your mother. Also, you\u2019re only a teenager, there will be so many milestones in the future that if she would just fit into your life where you want her now, those coming moments would deepen your relationship by virtue of sharing them together. Honestly? You all are showing more emotional maturity than all the adults in the situation. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around any of us and you\u2019re allowed to construct your world and family unit any way you want to and then if in the future you want to change it, you can do that to.", "I feel like stepmom is emotionaly manipulative, in addition to whatever else she is dealing with.\n\nNTA- You did nothing wrong, your stepmom forced the issue.  This is incredibly unhealthy OP.  I hope you have alerted your grandparents/aunts about this because you may need the support.", "Why are SO many of these posts about a second spouse acting like a freaking toddler about being \u201csecond best\u201d - it\u2019s sickening.", "NTA. I'm so glad I was an adult when my father met his wife. She made us go to one therapy session with her, and it was all about us making her feel unappreciated and not accepted. We weren't allowed to bring up any of the things she had done to us or that made us uncomfortable, that was all \"in the past\". But things that my siblings did the first time they met her was fair game for that session. \n\nJani's therapy sessions are for her. If your family wants to see a family therapist, it needs to be separate from her individual therapist. It is impossible to be objective and support the whole family when you've heard all of the stories before from the narcissist.", "NTA. She needs another therapist or something...", "Nta, wth is this crap. It\u2019s not your job to make your step mother happy. It\u2019s kind of sick That everybody is catering to an adults feelings over children.", "NTA.\n\nShe is pressing you and of course your mother and grandma come before as for the extended family. Honestly is ridiculous to ask you to consider her family as your own. \n\nAnd I would suggest to see if you can do a complaint about the therapist. Maybe speak about all of this situation with one of your maternal aunts or your grandma. \n\nThe therapist seems more interesting in pleasing your paying dad and step mom then in doing is job. Please spend your Christmas as you wish, what he said is extremely wrong and is family alienation. Your mother family has already lost your mother they do not deserve to lost the 3 of you just because he has to earn more.", "YOU didn't choose your stepmom, your dad did.  So no, she wouldn't be the most important woman in your life.

I\u2019m with my wife(mother of my 6 kids) thank goodness. But if I were not I would not date anyone who didn\u2019t already have kids.  At least they would understand family dynamics.  This woman is gonna be your dads ex soon.  Calling you cruel because you don\u2019t kiss her ass is the cruelest thing your dad could have done. Your adult relationship with him will suffer.  It just blows my mind that people like your dad are so selfish.", "Nah- \n\nTbh I see why she feels that way it doesn't sound she has kids of her own. She wants a family. But it doesn't feel like it. And she feels excluded. Like an outsider. \n\nTbh I can't think of anything else cause I feel for jani than anyone else in this story.", "You\u2019re not the asshole but you do sound like you\u2019re kinda stiff arming her. She literally signed up for this so she needs to stop making it all about her", "I think stepmom is getting what she wants, which is emotional validation, rather than what she needs, which is actual therapy to uncover the core beliefs and life experiences that have created her distorted view of things in the first place. If she and OP\u2019s dad genuinely want things to change, it\u2019s time to find a new therapist. \n\nNTA.", "My therapist always says you can't change the way others are but you can change the way you react to them. \n\nAs a stepmom I hate and loathe every stepparent on this forum that act like they can replace a parent. You can't replace people, period. And I speak from experience. I also have adults in my current life who act more like parents than my own ever did. You can't force a bond.\n\nIt sucks about the therapist, because stepmom won't switch from someone that's coddling her and validating her feelings. Some therapists suck. I had one therapist in the past tell me I was moving on too fast after my abusive ex husband divorced me. I shouldn't date within the first year afterwards because I wasn't ready. (I was lonely, I didn't want to find the love of my life, I had just moved to a new state and wanted to meet people.) Stepmom needs a therapist that makes HER work om herself and not try to get the kids to change.", "I don\u2019t think step mom is suited to being a step mom. She went into it with her own pre-conceived ideas that she\u2019s trying to implement and is now trying to guilt everyone to make it happen.", "Yes think the same things", "She hasn't been in my life since I was 8. My mom died when I was 8. I did not know Jani then but even after a bit over 6 years, she has never been the person I have looked at for maternal advice. I have grandmother's and a couple of aunt's who fulfill that womanly role since my mom died. I don't lack for maternal figures but I do not look at Jani as one for me. My siblings may feel differently but for me, she's simply the woman my dad is married to.", "How is she being disrespectful? Everyone has their own will she has the RIGHTS to choose who she wants to be close with and who she doesn\u2019t. Her step mom expects to be the most important person in her life but that\u2019s just NOW how it is. OP should be the one to decide when or not she wants to see her as family because it\u2019s HER life. Step mom needs to accept that in this world you don\u2019t always get what you want. If she wanted them to love her as a close friend or relative i would understand but she wants them to love her as a MOM. They don\u2019t HAVE to love her as a mom because they already HAVE ONE. Pushing a relationship is never the answer they are not obligated to just give in to what the Step mom wants.", "I'm not angry about my mom's death or trying to upset Jani.
