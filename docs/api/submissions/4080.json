They've been together for a little over six years and married for about four now. Dad was a widower when they met. I'm 16f and my siblings are 14f and 12m. Our mom died 8 years ago. Jani has not adjusted well to being a stepparent. I think she thought she would be just a parent to us because our mom had died and didn't consider that we'd still talk about and have photos of mom. Over the years she has been to therapy and her and my dad have gone to couples sessions. In the last year the five of us have gone to family therapy and she has admitted it's hard for her because she feels like she's second best or a consolation to us and that we don't really love and want her. Dad assured her that \\*we\\* all love her just as much as mom, that she's his number one and is vital to our family.\n\nFor a while then in sessions she and the therapist would talk about how she feels like she's not a true member of the family, like she's a second class member, not someone we see as important in the structure of the family. She said she never felt love from any of us and she feels like even extended family, which she explicitly said was grandparents and any aunts and uncles, come before her when it comes to us kids. She said she sees it in so many things including the way we don't regard her parents as our grandparents or her two sisters as our aunts and how when I turned 16 and we did a nice dinner party, my guest list included both my mom and dad's sides of the family but not her side.\n\nMy sister was the first to speak during all this and she said nothing was ever done to make her feel bad. That she just doesn't think of her as her mom or as being her parent. Once that was said she was talking about how much that makes her feel bad and like she's not truly accepted. The therapist asked us to consider whether we'd be willing to deepen the relationship so she felt equally as loved and important as our dad and dad wanted us to consider ditching our typical Christmas dynamic and spend the time with her parents exclusively this year. Then three weeks ago she brought up that I had made something for class that went into details on my family and she pointed out that she and her family were not mentioned. Then she asked me why my grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins were mentioned on both sides, all with their own pages, but I couldn't make room for the most important woman in my life (her). I told her because she is not the most important woman in my life. I told her that will always be my mom, followed by both my grandma's. She asked if she was just second best then, if she was unimportant and I refused to answer. Afterward my dad and Jani both told me that I was cruel to say she wasn't the most important woman in my life when she is there every day and has done her best.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670327690, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ze4nud/aita_for_telling_my_stepmother_shes_not_the_most/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think it\u2019s time to get blunt and tell the group that you think perhaps individual therapy for Jani so she can work on exactly *why* she needs you all to pledge your undying love and devotion so badly would be a better idea than this.  Because if the goal of these sessions is to get you to pretend you don\u2019t miss your mom, let alone would ever choose Jani over having her back, that\u2019s not realistic, and you don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy.", "NTA, and I don\u2019t think this therapist is working well for anyone.", "NTA. You were honest, but you weren't nasty. Group therapy is a great place to work out your family issues and I commend your whole family for participating, but the only way these therapy sessions are gonna work is if everyone is truthful. Your father and stepmother should be thanking you for the honesty so you can all work on a solution together to help stepmom feel more included.", "NTA\n\nShe can\u2019t guilt or force you and your siblings into giving her the emotional connection that she\u2019s looking for\u2026all she\u2019s doing is creating resentment.", "NTA.

A stepparent is almost never going to replace a biological parent in terms of their importance to a child.

Where the parent has passed away, there is even less chance of this happening. \n\nThis is not to say that she can not be an important person in your lives, but she is incredibly naive to think that there is a hierarchy that she'll be at the top of. Your dad shouldn't be pushing this either. She is important to him as his wife and partner, but that doesn't automatically mean that his kids will feel the same. You can't force feelings.", "NTA\n\nThe reason why \u201cblended families\u201d have a higher failure rate is because the stepparent has a habit of coming in with this expectation they\u2019re gonna be on the same playing field as the kids bio parent.

Jani and your father\u2019s expectations of you are insane. This woman is putting her need to feel included above the needs of three literal children who have lost their mother. Your father seems to refuse to understand that his feelings for Jani are his alone, and that he and Jani will *always* need to hold space for your mom. Who on earth wants a 16-year-old to tell her she\u2019s more important than that child\u2019s deceased *mother*? It\u2019s worth mentioning everything you\u2019ve said here in therapy in clear, honest language. You shouldn\u2019t be having to do this work, but honesty in the sessions will allow the therapist to help.", "NTA.  Jani seems to be missing on of the most vital parts of being a good step-parent: you can\u2019t force the relationship with your stepkids.  Respecting their boundaries is a vital part of becoming family.  As soon as you start trying to force things, you push them away with whatever force you use to try to pull them closer.  Her demand to be the parent and the most important woman in her stepkids\u2018 lives is the biggest obstacle to actually moving towards those things.", "NTA, this woman's need to erase your mom is insidious", "NTA.

You can\u2019t force relationships and you cannot replace deceased parents. In time, she can become a valued member of the family. But not like this. I\u2019m very disappointed that your father is allowing this behaviour and also for the therapist to enable her selfishness.

In some of these instances I think your stepmom needs to realize a family dynamic was already made for holidays and such, does she expect everyone to just cut out your moms side of the family and replace them with hers? To me it looks like Your stepmom and your dad are overlooking the fact that you guys have lived your childhood around your mom and her side of the family too and of course you would be closer to the people you grew up around.

Your mom is important to you and Jani has no reasonable expectation for that to change just because she showed up. \n\nMy stepmother expected us to just embrace and accept her as our new mom, even though *we still lived with our mom.* 30 years later, none of us have any relationship with her whatsoever, which is sad because we would like to have one but she's still angry  that we didn't ditch our mom for her. \n\nJani needs a new therapist if this is really how the sessions go. But you are well within your rights to keep a healthy distance from her. Hang in there, I'm so sorry for your loss, and for having to be the adult in this situation.", "NTA.

She should've been there as a supporter. you see how can she ask for love, when she herself does not love you unconditionally? unconditional love means you put it out there without expecting anything in return.

I understand wanting to be close to the children you help raise, but she should know that, of course, she cannot replace your mother. You still have your family, and that's it. If she had married a man who was separated from his spouse, I suspect she would try to get the kids to call her \"mom\" too. \nA question you can ask in the next family therapy session (which the therapist should already have asked) is what her desired outcome is. How can you as a family make her feel included more than she is? \nYou don't have to do whatever it is, but her answer should be telling.

Because so far all she has focused on is trying to get Jani what she wants and nothing else. Sessions are normally all about Jani and how she feels and that's about it.", "Dad's kind of already done some harm with his declarations that we all love her and she's loved as much as mom. I know my siblings and I have never actually said that to her. And speaking for me I don't actually love her. She's okay. I have grown somewhat fond of her but it can be frustrating at times feeling like I have to watch my enthusiasm for my family because she gets upset by it because I never have that same enthusiasm for her.

As well as feeling like she's more important than our extended family and loved and wanted equally to our parents.", "Not long enough. And the family therapist sucks if he thinks that it's more appropriate to change all of your feelings about your late mother than to encourage this virtual stranger to accept that she chose her husband and he chose her, but the rest of you didn't choose any of this. If she would calm down and quit demanding to be the center of attention this would go better for all of you. NTA", "That\u2019s something to bring up with the therapist.

You can email or call the therapist.", "TBH, it sounds like Jani might need to consider individual therapy more than group therapy. Group therapy works well if everyone\u2019s needs are being addressed but it can break down by focusing on one member of the group.", "And that's perfectly okay. I think you should tell your father your feelings. He had no right speaking on behalf of your and your siblings concerning your feelings about your own mother in the first place. Sometimes the solution is that there is no solution.", "Not just mom either. She has the same kind of jealousy and hard time with our close relationship with dad's side of the family too.", "And that makes perfect sense.  I'm a stepmom to a very young child who lost their biological mother in tragic circumstances.  I also wanted to step in as a mom figure, and I think I have in a successful way.  But one thing I do NOT do is try to lessen the importance of the late mother in my stepchild's life.  I have literally told my stepchild that I'm grateful to their mom for giving me such a great kid to love.  \n\nI have also expressed that kiddo has 2 moms.  Their bio-mom and stepmom.  Because I don't want the kiddo to feel like they have none simply because bio-mom is dead.  The big difference being that my LO was VERY young when their mom died, and also very young when I came into the picture.  Little kids don't really understand the different nuances to family and I wanted to make sure the kiddo knew that I loved them.  I also didn't want the fact that my kiddo has a dead mom to be a huge part of their childhood which should be as carefree as possible.  I have also tried to make sure the kiddo gets to spend time with some of the extended family on the maternal side, with the exception of one family who has already engaged in harmful behavior to the kiddo directly.  Most act like they want to be a part of kiddo's life and then flake out when it comes time to participate.\n\nSo yeah it can be rough, but the kiddo's best interests should really come first.", "Yeah, that's not going to help anyone. You and your siblings need to be acknowledged too. \n\nYou're very smart and mature for your age, so I say just keep doing you and don't indulge her need to be number 1. You'll be independent soon enough and getting that space will probably help a lot.", "I could try email. I'm not sure that I believe it will do anything because she seems to be on one track. But who knows, maybe she'd change it up if someone speaks up.", "She's had individual therapy. She went there before doing marriage therapy with our dad and then family therapy was added last.", "After the reaction to my last piece of honesty I am not sure I want to be more honest with him. I worry he will see this as a reason to try and fix me, since how could I possibly think I don't love her. Ugh. I don't know. I never used to feel like I couldn't talk to my dad but right now his only priority is his wife and her feelings."]}
