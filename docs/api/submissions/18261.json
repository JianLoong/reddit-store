This is wild that she would try to eat from the non-onion side when there is still pizza on her side.", "NTA this is a pet peeve of mine. I can\u2019t eat pork and a coworker will make a fuss when I ask for just one cheese or veggie pizza but guess who starts reaching for the non-pepperoni, non-sausage, non-ham pizza once the food comes? If you can eat anything and know others are limited, don\u2019t take from the only food they can eat!", "NTA. I hate when people do this shit. I don\u2019t ever say anything because its not that big of a deal to me, but if you request toppings on a pizza you should ONLY be eating that unless everyone else is eating the topping pizza as well. Not everyone wants mushroom pineapple dick on their pizza.", "NTA.  Next time, no onions at all. Then instead of a 50:25:25 split it can be by even thirds.", "NTA. Sister is being greedy. She already has half a pizza to herself and she wants more?\n\nNext time, just get the whole pizza without onions.", "NTA. She's already getting the lion's share of pizza since half has a topping both you and your mother dislike. Trying to take from the other side is so selfish of her. Lol @ her being overly dramatic and accusing you of stealing food from her mouth. If anything she's stealing food from you and your mom. \n\nNext time don't accomodate her. If there's a topping others dislike, it doesn't get ordered. It makes no sense for half the pizza to not be available to 2/3 people eating.", "NTA. If there was more non-onion pizza than onion pizza I would disagree with you, but you and your mom are sharing half of the pizza while she gets her own half. Your sister was inconsiderate in taking a non-onion slice.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is the only one that likes onion... You got her half a pizza with onion.... If half a pizza isn't enough for her, then she can order and pay for another pizza for herself. That way you and your mother can have a whole pizza with the toppings you like.\n\nI dealt with the same issue growing up. My parents always had mayo and miracle whip in the house. I HATE MW and would only use mayo. Both my sisters would regularly (even though they liked MW) use all the mayo and then use the MW. Drove me fucking crazy.", "NTA.

Since she can't be considerate of others.  \nAccusing someone else of 'taking food out of my mouth' when they are clearly the person doing so is an entry level manipulation tactic.

How dare you stop me from eating (your food)\"\n\nMy advice would be to let her sulk as much as she wants, but don't own any responsibility for it. She tried to take your food and you stopped her.

She shouldn\u2019t be grumpy because she couldn\u2019t get an extra slice. If she wanted plain pizza she could take the toppings off or ask if anyone would mind beforehand. Its called having manners.

I\u2019m not sure how large your pizza was, but most average pizzas have 8 or 12 slices.

He would also typically eat more pizza than me.  So if we got anchovies to suit me, we'd ask for a half-order of anchovies, but we'd ask them to put them all on only three of the slices.  This way, most of the pie was anchovy-free,  so there were plenty of slices for him, but there was also enough for me.", "NTA. Sister is a hige jerk. In the future, buy pizza without onions.

You should maybe show her these comments, so that maybe, she'll realize how out of line she was.", "NTA. Your sister needs mental health intervention.", "NTA. Not in this case. While it is rude to stop someone from eating food, there are exceptions to this rule: a child putting their grubby little hands on the buffet; pointing out that the host wants to say a few words, or you're waiting for another guest to arrive before eating; if a certain food is reserved for the vegans or guests with a particular dietary restriction; and if someone has ordered a personalized item. In this case, your sister had an entire half pizza with her personalized item to eat from; to encroach on your and your mother's share is gluttonous. Maybe next time, see if you can order the onions on the side, and pre-separate the portions so sissy can see what pieces are hers. Sheesh!

Everyone gets the pizza, it's shared. OP made it so there's one side for her and one side for her sister. She made the pizza not a shared thing. She made it weird.", "It wasn't the OP's point, but it was a point you raised.\n\nIt wasn't one side for OP and the other side for Sis -- it was one side for Sis and one side to be shared by OP and Mom.  If Sis takes a piece from the non-onion half, that would leave only three slices to be shared by two people (assuming it's eight slices altogether).\n\nIf it's pizza for everyone to share with no restrictions as you say, then would it have been okay if OP and Mom told Sis they'd get half onion because that's what Sis wanted and then scarf down all the onion slices themselves, leaving none of them for Sis?"]}
