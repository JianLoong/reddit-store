She's a major ah here.", "NTA.  Every damn pizza from now on has ZERO onions.  She can just eat or starve.", "NTA. This is wild that she would try to eat from the non-onion side when there is still pizza on her side.", "NTA this is a pet peeve of mine. I can\u2019t eat pork and a coworker will make a fuss when I ask for just one cheese or veggie pizza but guess who starts reaching for the non-pepperoni, non-sausage, non-ham pizza once the food comes? If you can eat anything and know others are limited, don\u2019t take from the only food they can eat!", "NTA. I hate when people do this shit. I don\u2019t ever say anything because its not that big of a deal to me, but if you request toppings on a pizza you should ONLY be eating that unless everyone else is eating the topping pizza as well. Not everyone wants mushroom pineapple dick on their pizza.", "NTA.  Next time, no onions at all. Then instead of a 50:25:25 split it can be by even thirds.", "NTA. Sister is being greedy. She already has half a pizza to herself and she wants more?\n\nNext time, just get the whole pizza without onions.", "NTA. She's already getting the lion's share of pizza since half has a topping both you and your mother dislike. Trying to take from the other side is so selfish of her. Lol @ her being overly dramatic and accusing you of stealing food from her mouth. If anything she's stealing food from you and your mom. \n\nNext time don't accomodate her. If there's a topping others dislike, it doesn't get ordered. It makes no sense for half the pizza to not be available to 2/3 people eating.", "NTA. If there was more non-onion pizza than onion pizza I would disagree with you, but you and your mom are sharing half of the pizza while she gets her own half. Your sister was inconsiderate in taking a non-onion slice.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is the only one that likes onion... You got her half a pizza with onion.... If half a pizza isn't enough for her, then she can order and pay for another pizza for herself. That way you and your mother can have a whole pizza with the toppings you like.\n\nI dealt with the same issue growing up. My parents always had mayo and miracle whip in the house. I HATE MW and would only use mayo. Both my sisters would regularly (even though they liked MW) use all the mayo and then use the MW. Drove me fucking crazy.", "NTA. She already got half of a pizza just for her.", "NTA. you guys could've just ordered a full plain pizza if she wanted to eat some pizza without onions", "You're right - it is ridiculous. I guess she doesn't like onion as much as she says she does; next time order it without onion and when she kicks up a fuss let her know why. Since she can't be considerate of others.  \nAccusing someone else of 'taking food out of my mouth' when they are clearly the person doing so is an entry level manipulation tactic. Stomp that shit out. Not ok. Trying to school you in what's rude is another one. That comment is clearly epic flounce with very little reason to back it up.\n\n\"You're eating what isn't yours\"\n\n\"How rude!! How dare you stop me from eating (your food)\"\n\nMy advice would be to let her sulk as much as she wants, but don't own any responsibility for it. She tried to take your food and you stopped her. NTA \n\nWhat does your mum say about it all?", "NTA Her meal is the onion side. She was stealing from your meal. She sounds entitled.", "NTA she has a whole half a pizza to herself. While you and your mom have to share half of a pizza.", "NTA. My family and i prefer different toppings, so we always get half A and half B. I don\u2019t dislike the A toppings, but prefer B. But if I want a slice of the A side, I always ask first. And if the answer is no, I accept that.", "Like, strictly speaking about math you're NTA.  She should stay on her half.  She's already at an advantage in that the two of you are sharing a half.\n\nBut ESH for a really fuckin weird family dynamic here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In their case, she and her two sons would have half the pizza..(they didn\u2019t eat onions.). The other half had onions. So when the pizza arrived, abusive jerk would eat from the same side of the three of them. Then he still had another half of the pizza to himself.

It\u2019s not that big a deal I agree but in no way is this his fault.", "Disgraceful!

I wouldn\u2019t give two shits probably but its just a guy arguing with his SISTER about a pizza. Siblings always argue about dumb shit. She shouldn\u2019t be grumpy because she couldn\u2019t get an extra slice. If she wanted plain pizza she could take the toppings off or ask if anyone would mind beforehand. Its called having manners. To be mad about it after the fact is fucking stupid. OP isn\u2019t unreasonable for saying she shouldn\u2019t eat it,\nits not like he slapped the fucking slice out her hand.\n\nEDIT: Because you edited, how do you know whether or not OP ordered or helped pay for it?
