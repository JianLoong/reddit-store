That friend still doesn't know I hate her eggs. It's been ten years.", "I'm glad too!", "AS a coeliac, this makes me so mad. Happens at my work ALL the time, people without allergies eat the GF food while complaining its not fair that I get \"special treatment\"", "I love onion on pizza and doing it yourself tastes better most of the time anyway. You maintain more onion flavor and more of the satisfying crunchiness.", "A whole onion for 1 slice of pizza?!?!", "I mean, if she's curious, why not ask the vegetarian to recommend something and *order that for yourself?* She can take the gamble on it being great, and enjoying it, or not.", "I get that, but it was garlic bread LMAO. I feel like that doesn\u2019t quite apply xd. Either way what\u2019s done is done and I didn\u2019t go hungry that day so it was fine. Just a teeny bit annoying", "You\u2019re allergic to meat?", "What\u2019s miracle whip? I googled it and it looks like a brand of mayo", "I'm so sorry for your trauma! What a betrayal! MAYO AND MIRACLE WHIP ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE (Yelling for the Midwesterners in the back row)", "You should tell OP sister to eat her pizza with onion then shut up and stop making a huge drama out a pizza SHE WANTED. \n\nNTA OP but your sister sounds exhausting, next time she should be sure she actually wants onion is her damn pizza before order instead of being a spoiled brat causing a drama.", "Lol, no, one whole onion for however much pizza I ate.  Still a ton piled on, but not *quite* that much!", "Truly, she can be curious on her own dime. I have had friends do this to me too. The worst time I was out with 5 friends and all wanted a taste and a second and a third - all big mouthfuls. I was so flappergasted, I could not speak. I was left with under half a meal, but still had to pay full price. \n\nOr when friends wants to split an appetizer and I go \"can we get a veggie one?\" - suuuuure, and then they order nachos with chicken or ground beef! And then wonder why I do not touch it: \"bUt yOU caN JuST ScRapE tHE mEAt ofF...\"\n\nEdit: missing word", "Well like you said, it\u2019d be a gamble, she wouldnt wanna spend 20$ on a meal she wouldnt like, potentially. Haha.\nSorry, I shouldnt laugh.\nIt is also possible like on the garlic bread, she simply was not thinking. I\u2019d probably have done the same on that, I love garlic bread.\nI have the approach though of, please be blunt with me, I can be reasonable and understanding, I am not a mind reader. I try to be considerate, but sometimes I need something explained on why you need the garlic bread more than me. XD\n\nEdit: I\u2019m just now realizing the garlic bread may have been part of your meal, I was thinking of like an appetizer bread, which is common in US restaurants.", "Already had troubles digesting it when I still ate it, daily stomach aches. Gained a lot of weight finally when I stopped eating it (at least I found the cause). Now my body even produces less of the enzymes needed to digest it, so cross contamination ends up varying from stomach aches to being stuck in the bathroom with high fevers for 45 minutes", "It's much sweeter and usually reserved for things like egg salad. IMO, it's gross. Think of it this way.... Honey mustard vs regular mustard. Similar, but have different uses and tastes.", "It's a mayo-like product, a bit sweeter and with some spices added in. I think it's alright, but I prefer Duke's or Kewpie these days.", "it's like ranch if they removed all the ranch parts and left just oily milk", "I see your point but I disagree. There are two sides to this.\n\nPizza is a casual shared meal where people grab slices at random. If there are two kinds of pizza available, trying both types is normal. \n\nOP should stop being the pizza cop. If the pizza was really that scarce, they should have got more. And just not liking onions? That's such a weak reason for putting yourself in charge of the pizza. Pick off the onions, stop being controlling. I fully support the sister. \n\nY T A\n\nThe only answer is to get the mom involved. OP's mom, you're the only one who can answer this! Do it for reddit!", "Oh my goodness! I\u2019ve never heard of that so wanted to ask for education\u2019s sake. Did it take awhile to figure out that meat was the culprit, originally?", "Ohhh. A sweetened mayo. How American \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude06", "Haha ohh. I heard ranch sauce is really nice", ">The only answer is to get the mom involved. OP's mom, you're the only one who can answer this! Do it for reddit!\n\nYes, Mom can be the tiebreaker! :)", "Well, we didn't know what it was, we just knew I was skinny. Irritable bowel syndrome runs in the family as well (and I still suspect I have it). It took me years to realise after I became vegetarian that that was the problem actually \ud83d\ude05. And later I learned about the enzyme stuff myself.\n\nI hate it when people say I should eat meat again because I am skinny. It is gonna make me end up being in the hospital because I would lose so much weight probably. Sometimes bodies can't digest common food... I am feeling healthy with my current diet, although I have to be careful with my B12. That isn't in vegetarian and vegan food by default, so invest in some nice supplements! A well-balanced vegetarian or vegan diet still provides enough vitamins and minerals besides B12 luckily :).", "I\u2019m so happy for you that you were able to figure out what was causing your issues. So many people (like I was before asking you about your allergy!) are blind to allergies that exist to foods that are promoted as necessary or \u201cnormal\u201d."]}
