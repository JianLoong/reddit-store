That's a conscious decision.  \n\nIt really activates my almonds because it causes incorrect stereotypes to be made and gain traction, and good people get shunned and hurt because of it. \n\n\nLately i've been dealing with a lot of people who don't understand the difference between explanations vs. Excuses. Especially in the realm of chosen behavior. \n\n\nI am autistic, and there a pervasive misconception among non autistics that lacking social cognition is synonymous with being a jerk. We may be more brusque than is expected, but that's not the same thing. I and many other autistic people make a conscious choice to be kind to others because we are all too aware of what unkind people are like, we deal with them quite frequently. \n\n\nYet when someone chooses to be mean spirited, they are given a pass because \"that's how they are\" and the person affected is pressured to accept being hurt rather than the offending party being pressed to be kind. \n\nI once read \"When someone says \"that's just how they are\" respond with \"well this is how I am, are you putting the same amount of effort into trying to change them as you are to change me?\" \n\n\nThis was written about family interactions but can be applied to any situation where \"don't rock the boat\" is expressed. https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat/\n\n\nSo, back to \"explanation vs. Excuses\": it's intrinsically linked to \"intent vs. Impact\" my autism may explain my behavior, but it doesn't mean that I'm excused from being a decent person. I own my actions and if I misstep and violate a boundary, I sincerely apologize for that.  Along with taking it to heart and trying to do better in the future. Autism can mean that we don't fully understand social cues but we don't want to be unkind to people. Explain if possible and we are generally grateful for the emotional labor. \n\nA jerk, on the other hand, will cry \"I'm socially awkward, I can't help it, you can't hold me accountable!\" And make other people jump to their defense putting the hurt party in a position where they are revictimized for being upset. \n\nYou're in effect saying that the embarrassment or discomfort of the person being a jerk being called out for poor behavior is worse than the potential or actual harm done by the actual poor behavior. \n\n\"Don't scold my friend for kicking a puppy, they're allergic, and besides they only bruised it, calling them an animal abuser is mean!\" \n\nIt gives them social capital and they won't be held accountable for their CONCIOUS CHOICE to victimize people. It's abhorrent . And yet people still do it. \nAgain different scenario but applicable \nhttps://www.doctornerdlove.com/socially-awkward-isnt-an-excuse/\n\n\nThe above link discussed boundaries and how we as humans react when accidentally tripping over one in a dating sense but it still applies in general terms of life and interactions with people. \n\n\nSo to sum up: \nAutism is not a pass to be a jerk. \n\nSome not all people with poor social cognition are jerks. \n\nPoor social cognition is an explanation NOT an excuse. \n\nOwn your missteps, learn from them. \n\nDo better. \n\nDon't defend the missteps of others by saying the unknowable intent is more important than the known impact. \n\nHold them accountable, they own their choices.\n\nAnd above all, be kind, the world is not.", "Those are the people who don't like or love their spouse and see no difference because of that.", "Thankfully my family is dead, I joke about being the highlander with slightly fewer decapitations.", "Sweet Mother Mary, please don't put Miracle Whip in any of those dishes...
