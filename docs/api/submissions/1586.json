He\u2019d started out with significantly more visitation time, but was granted less after an incident when I was a year and a half old where I almost died (due to his negligence) while in his care. So my sisters and I lived with my mom most of the time. My dad lived in a completely different city that was about an hour away from where my mom lived. \n\nI distinctly remember *multiple* occasions throughout my childhood where my sister and I had to forego certain plans, activities, and experiences because they fell on our dad\u2019s \u201cweekend\u201d. I\u2019m not just referring to \u201cfun\u201d stuff like a friend\u2019s sleepover or a birthday party; if there was a death in the family on my mom\u2019s side, and the funeral was happening during his visitation time, we were not allowed to go. It was never a matter of our dad having other stuff planned for us on those dates and it also wasn\u2019t a matter of him being *incapable* of taking us himself. More often than not it was a situation where the easiest solution would have been to just skip his weekend and stay at our mom\u2019s so that she could take us to whatever it was; and we could make up the lost time later. He never wanted to do that, though. \n\nHe was adamant that \u201chis time\u201d was *his time*, and although I understood where he was coming from, it didn\u2019t make me resent him any less. It was just so obvious that he wasn\u2019t doing it because he valued our time together. He rarely ever actually did things with us while we were at his house, and much of the time it seemed like we (his children) were cramping his style. If anything, it seemed like he\u2019d be thankful to not have us imposing and inconveniencing him with our presence. That\u2019s the vibe he gave off, anyway. So when he\u2019d choose \u201cstrictly sticking to the visitation arrangement\u201d as his hill to die on, it left us feeling frustrated and confused. \n\nThose decisions that he made back then were *not* made with his kids\u2019 best interest in mind. Rather, they were made for selfish reasons on his part, and because he was so focused on and consumed with \u201cgetting his share\u201d. It wasn\u2019t even about him actually wanting to be with us, but instead it was about \u201cwinning\u201d and not \u201closing\u201d when it came to our mom. \n\nIn my case those events happened roughly 20 years ago and I still think about it (and get irritated over it) all this time later.

The question you should ask is \u2018what will I lose?\u2019. The answer is nothing, but your son will gain so much. Time with his brother and mum,  and she won\u2019t be completely exhausted and unhappy. Time with you and he will see how adults can compromise and accommodate others so that they can be happy. \n\nI\u2019m so sad for your son that you are such an AH.", "YTA. Why would you punish your kid like that?", "YTA, if you had a legitimate reason not to agree. I'd understand,  but to do it for no other reason than you believe she will ask for more after this, with nothing to back this up make you the AH.", "Believe it or not, op you are not going to live forever. The day come when all of the parents are gone. And those two siblings are going to need each other and they will need to have a strong relationship as adults. A sibling relationship can last for a lifetime. Do the right thing by your son.\n\nYTA.", "How much are the court fees to get an arrangement changed like this if both parents agree?", "Because if they switch without a court order and then gets mad she can claim he violated the original order.", "Also there's no guarantee that it's what the kid even wants! Op himself edits in that his son couldn't care either way (tough he could be lying) cause yes he doesn't get to hang out with his half sibling anymore, but he does get to have his mom all to himself now. \n\nNot only that but like how long have they had the schedule for? Cause even just a few months is long enough that switching weeks could be a big hassle because it's disrupting their typical schedule.", "This is very much a everyone's an asshole here situation. As you said, op is being awkward yes but there's a good chance he has had the same routine for half a decade now and he's just expected to suddenly change because ex's recent ex wouldn't? I don't think he's an angel here but I definitely understand why he would be pissed off. The mother and next ex should probably both be understanding", "I agree, she knew their scedule. Also, it'll cost him money to do her a favour, and she is not willing to compensate that? Biggest question would be what his son wants, as it doesn't sound like she's asking it for his son  but for herself\n\nESH, all adults. But I'd think OP less than the others\n\nEdit: mobile, posted while not finished my sentence", "Totally agree. It is the second baby daddy who must accommodate. On the other hand, if she does ask first baby daddy to give in, and since he'd be doing changes because of her situation, she should offer to pay for the whole paperwork and lawyers. If by doing so OP still refused, then he'd be the asshole, but he shouldn't have to be held responsible for the assholery of baby daddy 2.", "Exactly this! It\u2019s either ESH or NTA! His custody agreement existed before the second don\u2019t see why he has to change everything to suit the second ex husband and the ex wife?!", "But court orders aren\u2019t written with the weeks for the next decade. It\u2019s written as \u201cevery other week.\u201d", "Feels like details are missing too", "And the ex-wife could do the double week on the switch-over so he could take that extra week off as his \u201choliday\u201d that he so desperately wants to bargain for. Ideally the time between mum\u2019s two custody arrangements would stagger to different days  -  so the siblings spend 4-5 days together on their week with mum and also both get alone time with her, but that requires far to much consideration by OP. Just because the other dad is an AH doesn\u2019t mean you have to be OP.\n\nYeah, ex-wife should pay the legal fees for formalising the change, but why make a shitty situation more difficult just to get some side hustled benefit out of your kid. Agree to the change, move on with your life and you can actually use that as a bargaining chip in the future if you ever need your ex to treat you with consideration and kindness. YTA.", "Okay but while they're all arguing because they want to 'win' the person suffering is OPs son getting caught up in all the conflict. What does he even need to suck up exactly, he's getting the exact same amount of time with his child, plus his child gets a relationship with their sibling. These should only be positive things"]}
