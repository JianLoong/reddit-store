What a sad tale \ud83d\ude25.  \n\nBad stuff all around. It reads worse than something from \"James and the and the Giant Peach.\" My goodness.  \n\nNo, no one should have to put up with that nightmare. But your wife, I'm sorry... sounds too much like them for comfort.", "I usually don\u2019t say this but the SECOND I read what she said about blood relation I thought that this woman should NOT be a foster parent and that her behavior was horrible, as much as the guests. \n\nYou held the urge to kick them out, just refuse to invite them at all.", "NTA, plus wife sounds like a B", "I thought maybe you were overreacting until I saw the comment by your wife. I don\u2019t understand that way of thinking. I love children and so many have said they wished I was their mom. That usually happened if they were not in the greatest situations. But I am just a single mom and barely scrape by so I just give the kids emotional support and tutoring if they need it. \nI go out of my was to never tell parents how to raise their child. I can mildly suggest. \n\nI had some step nephews that became adults. One got a girl pregnant so she had an abortion even though it was against her religion. So lesson learned right? No, she got pregnant again and kept the baby. So I saw them during holidays and I had a baby too. \n\nI saw the other very young mom giving her baby Mountain Dew in her baby bottle. I didn\u2019t say anything about that. But I asked if her baby liked apple juice and she said I don\u2019t know she\u2019s never tried it. \nTheir baby fell off their bed five times before they realized they should not put her there. I only know that because they to.d me", ">She also said that May and Eli were her own blood and she had no actual relation to our foster kids.\n\nNTA and this is a HUGE, HUGE red flag!", "NTA. Your wife however... it's incredibly cruel to say something like that about your foster kids", "NTA but sorry as a Foster parent to say that is awful. Foster children need to know they are respected and cared for. For your wide to say and do that shows she may not be cut out for fostering. How long have you been fostering your children?", "NTA\n\nAs soon as your wife brought blood ties into it, she crossed the line. The harm this sort of comment can inflict on an adopted or foster child is unreal.", "NTA but your wife and her family are. I am sad for the foster children.", "\"She also said that May and Eli were her own blood and she had no actual relation to our foster kids.\"\n\nFrankly, your wife sounds as awful as her brother and his family. No kid, foster or otherwise, should have to be tormented as your kids were. Does she have no idea what that attitude does to them? I'd be tempted to tell my wife to go live with her brother if she likes that behavior so much, and keep the kids.\n\nNTA.", "NTA  \nYour BIL and his wife have failed at parenting and your wife is just in denial or is taking this callout as a personal attack.\n\n>She also said that May and Eli were her own blood and she had no actual relation to our foster kids.  \n>  \n>Rey also found it difficult how my wife fawned over Meg, despite her poor behaviour\n\nYou should be worried for the future and safety of your children.", "NTA - all of this is understandable EXCEPT this \" She also said that May and Eli were her own blood and she had no actual relation to our foster kids\"\n\nBig red flag in my eyes....", "NTA. I feel so bad for your children. Your wife is horrible for saying her \"blood relatives\" are more important to her than her foster kids. If that's how she feels, she shouldn't have them. \n\nI would have brought it up during the visit to her. It's your house, too, and you and the kids shouldn't have to be uncomfortable where you live. Don't ever agree to them staying again.", "You are NTA but your wife definitely is. She should NEVER have applied to be a foster parent in the first place if thats how she views it. Just because you're not blood related to your foster family does not mean that you have no relation to them. YOU ARE LITERALLY RELATED BY LAW BECAUSE YOU CHOSE TO FOSTER THESE CHILDREN AND BRING THEM INTO YOUR HOME FOR THE PURPOSE OF BEING THE PARENTAL FIGURE FOR THE CHILD WITHOUT A PARENT!!!! I truly believe your wife should not even have her own blood related children with this kind of thinking... she probably only did it for the money which is an emotional scam on you, the children, AND the system.", "NTA, I think. Your wife\u2019s first responsibility is to you and your children. It\u2019s really difficult to be the one to stand up to your spouse\u2019s family when your spouse is oblivious. However, I do have a couple questions:\n1. Did you bring this up with your wife at all while her family was there? If not, you could be the AH for not communicating while there was a solution.\n2. Why didn\u2019t your kids go directly to your wife? Do they not feel comfortable telling their own mother that they don\u2019t feel their belongings are safe in their own home?\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t see the part about your wife saying that her \u201cblood\u201d relatives > foster kids. No wonder they came to you instead. Your wife is clearly unfit to be a foster parent if she treats foster children as second class citizens in her home.", "Definitely NTA. That being said, I'd be curious as to how you approached the conversations with your wife. As is the way with most difficult family conversations, if she felt that you were attacking and judging her family rather than expressing how their actions made you feel, I'm sure you could seem like the asshole. I feel for you as I've had similar situations with family, but thankfully my wife and I are aligned and can confide in each other. It sounds like you're feeling a bit vulnerable and that's where I would start any conversations - focusing on how you're feeling rather than getting into an us vs. them discussion that will feel adversarial.\n\nEdit: wow, totally missed the part about the foster kids not being \"blood\" relations. While it's still important how you approached the conversations, this is a big red flag and something that I think you should address ASAP. I would seriously question any parent who deems their kids (either foster or step kids) as lesser than that of a blood relative.", "NTA , just because they are family does not mean they get a free pass to be pieces of trash and honestly your wife not doing anything means she is just as bad, and I don\u2019t care if your kids are fosters, your wife not giving a crap about them just makes her the biggest piece of trash ever.", "NTA.  First of all, that parenting style is the worst!  It's hardly parenting at all.  I couldn't have entertained that for more than an hour without having a stern word with the kids AND the parents.\n\nSecond, your wife sounds awful!  This in particular was the nail in the coffin:\n\n\"I also told her how upset our kids were.\nMy wife said they were her family and it was only for a few days, so we should have just put up with it. She also said that May and Eli were her own blood and she had no actual relation to our foster kids.\"\n\nI hope she treats your kids with kindness normally, but given that quote I suspect not as much as she should.  At least they have you!  You sound like a great parent!", "\u201cshe also said that May and Eli were her own blood and she had no actual relation to our foster kids\u201d\n\nWhat did I just read?! That was a horrendous thing for your wife to say. These parents need to be told whether they like it or not and your wife\u2026to be honest, if my wife said this it would be grounds for a separation. You\u2019re concerned about the safety of you and your children\u2019s piece of mind and possessions. Your wife isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t rude to have boundaries about your things in YOUR house. Smash those boundaries down and if they\u2019re not respected you are entitled to tell them to leave.", "NTA.\n\nAnd would have called time on this BS LOOONGGG before they left.  Your BIL is a disrespectful A-hole and your wife is enabling that.  Can't stand this (non)-'parenting' style.", "NTA but divorce that woman asap. That last comment shows that she doesn't care about your kids at all. You would be the asshole if you kept your kids in that situation", "Wow, that sounds like the nightmare visit you wish upon your enemies. Cannot believe your wife would let that slide and that she does not care about her foster kids as much as her niece. Troubling I would say. You are NTA for pointing out to your wife that she was an asshole for letting her fosterkids be terrorized by her 'blood'.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d point out that you have no actual relation to her family either and you shouldn\u2019t have to put up with their mess", "**WOW - YOUR WIFE IS AN ASSHOLE**\n\nI am so sorry that you and your foster kids had to go through this but your wife just showed her true colors.   NTA", "Why are you guys even foster parents? NTA, but your wife is.", "NTA and your wife is trying to act like there's no cost to these visits.  Keep letting her know the burden it puts on you and the rest of her family.\n\nIt will come in handy when you want to do something that she doesn't want to do.", "NTA. \"Sure, let's do nothing while our guest basically destroy our home\" I suppose this is what your wife expected you to say.", "NTA\n\n>My wife said they were her family and it was only for a few days, so we should have just put up with it. She also said that May and Eli were her own blood and she had no actual relation to our foster kids.\n\nThis comment is a **massive** red flag. \n\nYour wife is telling you that your vulnerable foster children's wellbeing is low on her list of priorities because the people causing them distress are her blood relations. Presumably she chose to be a foster parent?\n\nPlease don't fail these poor kids by brushing off your wife's comment. They deserve to be in the care of a safe, loving family and if your wife cannot provide that for them, then they should be placed elsewhere.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife's comments about your foster children not having \"real\" relations is really messed up, and she's letting her niece and nephew run roughshod over your household because she wants \"real\" children.\n\nStand your ground, your children shouldn't feel unsafe or insecure in their own house.", "NTA but your wife definitely is. Your foster kids are your responsibility and hers, for her to blatantly prioritise her niece and nephew's wants over their needs and come out and say what she said is something that needs addressing.", "Yea wtf. Those kids are going through enough and foster mum acts like this??\n\nI have no idea why OP is with her but I hope she has some amazing redeeming because it sounds like she and her brother are cut from the same crappy cloth. \n\nNot forgetting that her precious blood couldn\u2019t be bothered to see her for years.", "I thought exactly the same when I read that. If she views herself as \u2018not a relation\u2019 to children with established abandonment issues then she should go live with her relations.", "Kind of saw it coming when he said the wife spenfmd more time with her niece than with her kid.\n\nI Wonder if she really wanted to foster...", "HUGE", "That <blood relation>  comment made the alarm bells go off for me,  too.   I  think they should go for couples counseling asap.  They have emotionally fragile kids who do not need to feel less than just because of their DNA.", "I don\u2019t know what the purpose of this non prentice style is because these children are monsters. Children can\u2019t grow without boundaries"]}
