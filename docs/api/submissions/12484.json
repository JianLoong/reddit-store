Even better, far as I know she wasn\u2019t even religious.", "How about a dude named Rage? Wtf?", "Teacher in LA- Tesla, Tiberius, Galaxy, Orion, there are way more but I took a melatonin", "Reed/Reid isn\u2019t that uncommon. Banks is far better than naming your son Cowboy.", "Can't see how that wouldn't sound like Urine-ness out loud.", "I'd be more mad about using Artemis and Athena when Artemis and Apollonia would at least ALLUDE to a couple of the most famous twins in mythology...\n\n\nEven though the A. & A. screams for a bureaucratic nightmare, tbh. (coming from a mother of twins who has the same initial and last name as her husband, working for the same company)", "Having a little boy and naming him Jesus.", "great joke :)", "And her brothers were named Fat Man and Little Boy", "Sure is", "I once met someone called Experience who was running a workshop. She would (unironically) say things like \"Experience is important\".\n\nCringe.", "It\u2019s pronounced \u201cMelissa\u201d", "I knew a dude who was named Blade. Born three months after the first movie came out. Went by his middle name and has a strained relationship with his mom who refuses to call him anything else lol.", "CTFU", "A really nasty saying about a Kevin in Germany is this: Kevin isn\u2019t a name, it\u2019s a diagnosis.\n\nIt comes down to people needing to feel superior to somebody. Looking down on poorer or less educated people is common pretty much everywhere I have been.", "TBH, the Germans are not alone in this!\n\nSigned: a working class Brit who grew up in poverty but my parents had more pride than to give us \"chavvy\" names. It was hard enough to get ahead without all that - why make it worse.", "I never heard of this word, but can confirm that I know a few  really low class families, the kids all have British/American names.\nI can think of Kevin, Dustin and Brian.", "I\u2019ve always known Jesse as the male form and Jessie as the female, usually short for Jessica. Similar to Jamie for a girl and Jaime for a boy.", "You are an amazing parent.", "I agree with that wholeheartedly.\n\nMy mother was so weird about me being a tomboy. I liked it (spoiler, I'm a trans guy) but she was always like \"You're a girl who likes boy things.\" Like... isn't that what tomboy means? But she'd get on me for using that word.\n\nShe also hated the word bossy and replaced it with \"leadership potential.\" As my therapist lovingly said, \"Wow, your mom sounds like shit!\"", "I joke with new people i meet that they are allowed to ask me what my name is 3 times.  It actually usually helps them to remember, but if they don't and ask me for my name again, i'm like \"Okay, but this is your first freebee\" lol.  It sounds stupid but it usually goes over well and honestly at least I can joke about having an uncommon name.", "Cat named Luna...I sometimes call her Tunafish Sandwich", "I have a dog whose actual name is Blueberry so we\u2019re not much better over here", "yeah, i'm perfectly glad i was not named after the dallas cowboys (or any sports team) but being named after a place isn't that weird and IMO isn't bad. Dallas would not be my choice though, but London is nice, or maybe Alaska, Cheyenne, Austin, Colorado Springs (joking about the last one).", "Yeah the Becca part was supposed to be the compromise lmao", "I knew an Emmaleigh. All one word. Not as bad as Mckuenziey, but still yikes.", "Messiah is actually in the top 300 names given out to American baby boys born in 2021.

Amma-jeen\u2026. Queue my surprised face when she corrected me by saying \u201cits Imagine\u201d\u2026..\nAs my brain screams\u2026. Uuhhhh no it\u2019s fuckin not\u2026. I replied with an\u2026.. ok, imagine.", "Oh, I mean in conjunction. Since reeds grow on riverbanks.\n\nAnd it was spelled like the plant, too, lol.", "Royalteigh", "We should talk about Kevin.", "Kevin is an anglicised version of a beautiful, Irish name meaning - Comely at birth. My father\u2019s name was Kevin and I loved him so much.  I always loved the name and decided if I had a little boy I would honour my father by using his name. My first son was a beautiful baby, a delightful child and a decent, loving man. His name is Kevin and it goes very well with his surname.  It is a perfectly acceptable name here in Ireland.", "My pup went from Callisto -> Toto -> potato; the other part's from her smelly feet lol. It's so funny what we end up calling them after all the effort of picking names!", "Cowboy Danger Marzipan. \n\nI think we\u2019ve about wrapped this one up.", "My name is made up but follows the linguistic style/spelling/pronunciation of a specific non-English language to the point that anyone familiar with that language can pronounce it correctly w/o issue. I've never understood taking standard/traditional names and doing a freestyle remix; make up something new if you want your kid's name to stand out *that* much.", "I know two brothers named Forest and Sawyer. (A sawyer is someone who saws wood)\n\nI don't think they were trying to cause fratricide. But it does sound like it.", "Jacques \n\nBut I like Jacques Whipper.", "I think I vaguely remember someone coming up with a fantastic plan with the idols, it might have been him. I can't remember when I stopped watching except that it was definitely post Fiji which was apparently season 14, because that's when Yau-Man Chan was on who was also really great and only didn't win because he made a deal with someone for the immunity idol and they went back on it. Ah, nostalgia! That was quite a fun show a lot of the time.\n\n(Though never quite as funny as I think it was either NZ or Australia Treasure Island where one of the teams raided the crew's camp and tried to justify it as a survival skill lmao.)", "...is it bad I don't think that's horrible XD", "No you're thinking of the Texas Ranger", "So they weren't.", "I met one named Youneeque \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "I like a little info because it helps them feel human to me. I've had a mix of both and tend to trust them more when I get an idea of who they are, not just a doctor at a computer. Like I knew 2 therapists ago that she was Jewish and had a son. My current therapist used to work at Sam's club and has a wife and kids, and told me how he preferred working at Sam's club for years before he got back into school than working in his degree field. So like it isn't deep, it isn't telling me his kids' dance recitals and crazy stuff like that, but it's enough for me to let down my walls and actually trust him.\n\nOversharing is bad. I agree with that. (Obviously the therapist, not you the client) But it can vary and depend on preferences, and there's a therapist style for everyone. Just because something doesn't work for me doesn't mean it won't work for everyone. That's the neat thing about so many therapists."]}
