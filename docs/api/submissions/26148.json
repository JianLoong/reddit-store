Congratulations on passing your exam! Be proud of yourself and ignore the jealous mom. Some people are just like that. It has nothing to do with you. I feel sorry for her son.

You weren't to know he failed the exam. I love seeing other people do well - congratulations \ud83d\udc4f", "NTA.  Your celebration at your own success is not schadenfreude about her son's failure.  Next time, skip their house.", "It's the first time I heard about giving out sweets to your neighbors as a form of personal celebration, but also not my country, not my neighborhood, not my business \n\nGood for you for passing your exam & for sharing your joy with community \n\nAlso NTA", "NTA, that was a nice thing to do to celebrate.\n\nHow the heck were you supposed to know that this woman's son hadn't managed to pass the exam?

Go tell the (favorite sport league) fans they can't celebrate the winning team because it rubs the opposite team in the wrong way ! NTA Congratulation. Sorry for the boy, but he better not get out of his house for a few days because he'll certainly cross path with a few people celebrating or braging about they exam they just passed.", "NTA, come on, no way are you responsible for her son failing the exam and it's not your concern, enjoy and celebrate and we'll done man.", "If this woman is the only one with a complaint, you're undoubtedly NTA.

Hard for Americans to understand.  \nGood job and good luck.", "NAH I know it\u2019s a tradition to distribute sweets when something good happens, like having a baby or a wedding or yes, doing well professionally/academically. But, I will point out that when it\u2019s the latter, you do risk it feeling like bragging, especially since you went outside the boundaries of people you know and can assume will be happy to hear the news. You instead went to neighbors who you apparently don\u2019t even know well enough to name or realize that their son was also taking exams. It\u2019s a little much and I can see why it would sting to her.", "\"I'm so sorry...

I don\u2019t think you were in the wrong because you were clearly trying to share and be pleasant with good intentions. But maybe be more aware when it comes to that family that they are sensitive about those things.
