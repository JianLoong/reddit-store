My wife seemed to understand but then went against what I told her.\n\nA few days ago, my mom called me in tears and asked if she's a bad grandma. \n\nI asked what she meant and she sent me screenshots of my wife pestering her over and over to take the kids for the weekend. \n\nThere was a Christmas party that weekend me and my wife were interested in but we haven't been able to secure a babysitter unfortunately, but stuff like that happens when you have children.\n\nThe texts basically went like this (not exact quotes, otherwise this post will be too long):\n\nWife: please please please take the kids for the weekend, OP and I want to go to a Christmas party\n\nMom: I would love to, but I don't think with my health status I can really cope with babysitting the kids and taking care of myself\n\nWife: please, you're our village.\n\nMom: I can't\n\nWife: please?

You're a bad grandma and a bad mother-in-law.\n\nI talked to my wife about the texts and she believes that she's completely in the right. She called my mom lazy and a \"evil MIL\". I lost it and told my wife she's being extremely cruel to my mother and that she has no right to demand things off of her and that she really hurt my mom's feelings.
