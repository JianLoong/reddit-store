However, you doing something kind for her sister doesn't make you the AH. If she had been with you while you shopped and asked you to please leave the dress for her it would be a different situation. If you're still feeling guilty maybe offer to shop with her and help with alterations if you have time. But even if you don't have time for that you're still NTA.\n\nAlso, I worked at a thrift store for almost a year, and the greater majority of thrift store clothing is either recycled or trashed so you \"rescuing\" the dress is great.", "NTA- it sounds like you made your friend a super cute dress and her sister is jealous.", "NTA. Hi, plus size person here. It is extremely hard to find cute clothes sometimes, especially at thrift stores. I thrift a lot, but I do think buying a dress or something else once in a while to alter it is fine. It would be different if you were only looking in the plus size section when you went thrifting and buying these clothes to alter was an everyday thing or you were buying hundreds of plus size items. It\u2019s ONE dress. She can get over it. Tell her Forever 21 does offer plus size as well so she could buy the dress there too if she wanted.", "NTA. As a plus sized baddie myself I have no problem finding clothes. \n\nThere was a time when anything over a size 10 was only moo moos and sweatshirts but there's literally several companies geared towards us curvier women.\n\nYour friends sister is lashing out because of her own insecurities; ignore her like your friend said.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, but if she texts again send her this list:\nMonifC\nCurvysense\nPrettylittlethings\nAshleystewart \nFashiontofigure\n\nAll carry plus size fashion", "Seriously NTA. She could have sent a text that went along the lines of 'totally love the dress you scored for my sister, the work you did looks great on her- keep an eye out for one for me!'

What's with that stupid level of entitlement she has? And \"stress all over again\"? You didn't take the dress away from her. She probably would've never found it anyway so she's just being confrontational about it for no reason. Ignore her, and move on. Tell her to go to Torrid or something and get over it.", "NTA. You did a nice thing for your friend. Her sister isn\u2019t entitled to your thrift finds.", "NTA what a bizarre and entitled response from her sister", "NTA.  Her sister sounds really entitled.

She may do better to take up thrifting / sewing as a part time hobby as well so that she can modify clothes. Her central concern is founded- clothing companies don\u2019t make it easy for all sizes/proportions to find outfits, even online. A fitting dress on the rack is a rare resource.

You did something nice for your friend, and that message has more absurdity than I care to break down, so I'll confine myself to this: the woman doesn't even know that she would've liked the dress as originally purchased. For her to somehow assume that it would have been her perfect dress is pure nonsense.", "She didn\u2019t even see the original dress. \n\nOften a thrift store dress that looks awesome *after* tailoring is not particularly appealing in its original state. \n\nJust because your skill made something beautiful out of the material you saw, it does NOT mean that the original dress was attractive. \n\nChances are it wasn\u2019t - that\u2019s why it ended up in a thrift store.

As a plus sized woman myself I find her anger at this situation absolutely ridiculous. Yes it\u2019s extremely frustrating that not many stores carry clothes in larger sizes and it is even more frustrating that often the larger sized clothes that can be found aren\u2019t as cute or flattering as the straight sized clothing but that doesn\u2019t mean that literally every single piece of cute clothing in a large size found at a thrift store need to go to plus sized people just because we struggle to find clothes in normal stores.

However. Your friends sister is absolutely correct. Finding well made, affordable, fashionable clothes is extremely difficult for plus sized women. And due to this, clothes that size are rare to find in thrift stores since the people who own them usually hold onto them until they can't anymore.\n\nIt is fairly well accepted in the crafting community that if you're simply looking for a large amount of fabric, just buy the fabric and leave the clothing for people who actually need it. It's the ethical thing to do.", "Listen. This thread simply isn't going to give you much besides N T A verdicts and it's not that I think Y T A, but rather, there genuinely is a growing etuquette around how and when we seamstresses size down thrift store clothes. I'm going to go with NAH judgement for the following reasons:\n\n1) let's be perfectly honest. A lot of the people who go to theuft stores to buy clothes do so because they cannot afford to buy clothes unless they're second hand. I've spent most of my life poor enough that the only way I got new clothes was from a thrift store because if it cost more than $5 an item it simply wasn't going to happen. This means many of the people clothes shopping at thrift stores do not have the option to go somewhere where a comprehensive and varied stock of sizes and fits are available, and are limited to what happens to be donated. It can take multiple trips to come away with a single new outfit or even just a single item if you are a size that appears more rarely.\n2) there are a few different sizes that are pretty rare in thrift stores and if you have \"never seen a dress this big before\" then I guarantee you it's one of the rare ones. Try buying a wardobe in anything over a size 3x at a thrift store sometime and see how many visits it takes you to manage it. There are a lot of theories about why some sizes are more common than others at thrift stores, and that's its own interesting discussion, but regardless garments for very large people are a hard snag at modt thrift shops.\n3) poverty and being overweight have a correlation for a variety of reasons that don't actually matter a lot right now because the fact of the matter is overweight people are disproportionately likely to be living in the kind of poverty that makes thrift stores their only option for clothes shopping.\n4) as any seamstress knows, there's more work/coordination of aesthetic/materials/etc involved in the process of upsizing something than there is in the process of downsizing something which means that a large garment is easier to make small than it will be to make large again if that is not an anticipated change built into the pattern.\n\nTLDR: there is nothing inherently wrong with an individual buying a large size garment cheaply at a thrift store as materials for a smaller size garment project. The problem occurs when A LOT of people make the decision to do that and cause a considerable impact on an already extremely limited yet essential resource for a specific group of people. It's not like there's a level of overweight where the societal responsibility to wear clothes in public goes away, and it's not like plus size clothes often costing near double straight sizes when new is going to magically make poor people who are fat any less poor. Because of this, it is increasingly understood in thrifting communities that it's a bit of a dick move to substantially downsize clothes (e.g. more than 1-2 sizes) from thrift shops with any regularity. You're N T A, but neither is the person who is (admittedly not as gently as she could have, but given how personal and painful the clothes shopping experience can be for fat people maybe we give some grace there) trying to educate you about that etiquette when she realizes you may not know it. I don't think you meant any harm, but you should probably at least know why this is being considered part of thrifting etiquette because otherwise you may find yourself unknowingly contributing to some essential resource scarcity that can have a really emotionally and materially devastating impact on more people than you think.", "Nta but she\u2019s self loathing like she needs to let it go", "YTA it\u2019s been widely known for a while now that thinner people who tailor thrifted plus sized clothing is a shady move. And of course you didn\u2019t \u201cknow.\u201d You\u2019re not plus sized and neither is your friend. It seems neither one of y\u2019all consider her feelings or anything else.", "NTA", "NTA.

I find it almost impossible to find bras or jeans in my size because of the way I carry my weight. Yes, it sucks that the fashion industry is only just starting to cater to anyone over a 10 or anyone with \"not normal\" proportions. But none of that is on you and no one is ever entitled to a piece of clothing simply because of their size. The sad truth is that if she genuinely has this much trouble finding clothes that fit she either needs to start looking into making her own or researching better brands to buy from. A lot of them are more expensive but brands like Torrid are great quality and last for a long time. And as much as people don't want to hear it, plus size stuff is always going to be at least an little more expensive, it's more fabric.\n\nI understand this is all coming from her frustrations finding affordable clothes.

However, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole. As someone who\u2019s plus sized it can be hard to find clothes, but I\u2019m realistic.

She has some valid points about the plus size clothing industry, but the bottom line is THAT IS NOT YOUR PROBLEM.

She's jealous that her sister got an amazing, custom gift from you, and she's frustrated with herself over her body type. Once again, NOT YOUR PROBLEM.", "NTA\n\nI do think the sister is reacting to the popular trend of \"upcycling\" plus sized thrift clothes for social media clout.\n\nThat trend is pretty AH, but that's not what you did. You saw an item you wanted to alter for a friend, then got the item and did the alterations. Not for a single tiktok video or whatever, but because you genuinely thought your friend would love the item and get a lot of use from it. What you did is pretty much the reality of what thrifting is for people of any size to get quality, attractive clothes from thrifting. Clothes end up in thrift stores primarily because they are no longer fashionable or no longer fit correctly. This is even more true for plus size clothes. \n\nNow, this said, the sister has a fair point about plus size clothes being rare in thrift stores and expensive across the board. There is something to the idea of leaving those clothes for those who need them. Or, even better, if thrifting is a hobby, making sure those clothes get to those who need them by buying them and giving to friends/family or redonating to closets for those in need. If you're willing and able to help with minor alterations or repairs, even better. But, this is not an obligation. You don't have any particular duty to help plus sized people to not be an AH while thrifting clothes.", "NTA- but I can understand the sister jealously, its hard to find a dress being a plus size woman, but that's no excuse for the way she reacted.

But the larger problem she was talking about is a real thing. Which is why I didn't provide judgement.\n\nYou use less new fabric when you make clothing items for smaller people then you do larger people. And there aren't that many options avaliable for larger people to wear. This is one of those issues where you weigh the human factor to the possible environmental factor. Larger people usually only have access to clothes they can feel comfortable in from fast fashion sites that make poor quality clothes from slave labor, or ridiculously over priced brands that are practically exploitation. So to take an option away from them that allows them to actually make a choice about where and what type of clothing to buy, you are acting unethically.", "I think you'll find that people often have a strong emotional reaction when this concept comes into play: \"essential resource scarcity that can have a really emotionally and materially devastating impact on more people than you think.\"\n\nHer message actually seems pretty clearly to me *not about this specific dress at all* but rather about the pain and expense that she is experiencing beyond her capacity to cope with it. OP just happened to step on that nerve with her gift. As for \"snooping\", I'm prepared to be wrong, but OP's telling didn't seem to indicate to me that this was done sneakily or maliciously? I read it as maybe she was seeing if there were any more fabric scraps left usable because she also liked the pattern and happened across the tag. This might just be a product of how normal it is in seamstress circles to share scrap fabric, and me not seeing that as out of the ordinary in any way.

You restyled it so it likely didn't look much like what she expected.\n\nAnyways, you weren't shopping for her. She wasn't in your thoughts, her sister, your best friend, was the one in mind.

Very selfish and jealous attitude from her.", "NTA, sweetie. Not even in the slightest. \n\nThis was a particular pattern your friend loved. Of course you thought of her when you found it! Honestly it sounds like your friend\u2019s sis is just looking to be offended & start a fight. Also very likely jealous. But her text to you was just ridiculous. I\u2019d be hard-pressed not to ignore/block her & be done with her drama. \n\nClearly if you found that dress in a thrift/secondhand store, that piece of clothing was once made/sold new. Has friend\u2019s sis thought to look into where it was originally produced/sold from? \n\nUnless it was a custom-made or non-branded piece, friend\u2019s sis could go to the Google & search the clothing brand.

That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done with thrift clothing items I really loved or wanted more info on.\n\nFor you to have found that dress is pretty incredible; at least in my experience, thrifting is hit & miss. It takes luck, a good eye, and some hard work to find those treasures. Who\u2019s to say that it for sure would have been bought & used if you hadn\u2019t found it? Your friend\u2019s sister is more than welcome to take a look in thrift stores herself. \n\nI love that you gave a second life to the dress.

You seem like a good seamstress.", "NTA.\n\nI am a plus sized woman.

I do, because it really *is* hard. But:\n\n1. I'm confused about your friendship, sister says that you have been best friends since you were kids, but your post reads as if the real friendship is not really with her. Does she have a different perspective on your relationship? If the sister feels closer to you than you do to her it really complicates things as it is the other sister you refer to as your best friend.\n2. The sister considers your tailoring the dress itself to be a horrible thing done to *her*. I can understand that she is disappointed and also probably hurt that you didn't immediately think of her when you saw it, but... well see item 1.  You made a gift for *your* best friend and the sister sees it as an action against her.\n\nWithout names, I really struggled to be clear which sister I was talking about at a given time using only pronouns so I hope this makes. But might that be part of what is bothering you about the text?", "Hahahaha nta, the sister is delusional if she thinks she somehow has a claim on a dress just because of its size.", "NTA. You didn't steal a dress from her, you bought one from the thrift store. No one is preventing her from thrifting her own dress.

Instead of seeing the dress on your sister and being happy for her, and thankful that she has a friend in her life that loves her, you try and you're trying to make this about you?  You say you'd kill for a dress like this.  Shop at thrift stores like I did to get this one.   I'm not stopping you.   I'm also not your personal shopper responsible for seeking out items for you.

Some people are so extremely self centered they think anyone not putting them first is being selfish.", "NTA. You bought it because it was a pattern similar to one your friend likes and tailored it to fit her. That's different than buying larger sizes all the time and downsizing them. I'm really tall (6'1\", 36\" inseam), so buying at thrift stores is never something I can do. Tall clothing is rare even in stores, and I guarantee that women buying them at thrift stores don't care, they just shorten them.", "op=NTA\n\nShe claims you are best friends, clearly you don't regard her as so.  Has she ever indicated you were best friends--because i call BS on the claim and it's merely meant for guilt.\n\nHowever, that is really immaterial.   You bought something because of it's specific pattern that the younger sister loved, which is why you bought it.  Much as you would buy a length of fabric(tho I imagine at today's prices for MUCH cheaper).  Besides if older sister wanted some plus size clothes, why wasn't she rummaging through thrift shops?\n\nThis is such BS about it being plus size so only a plus size can have it.  \n\nSo by that, a woman should never get men's clothes(or shoes) because hey those are for MEN and men can't wear women's clothes(or heels?).  \n\nOr short people can never get clothes for taller people and hem them up, because TALL people need them and it's hard to find clothes for TALL people.", "Are you her clothier?

Nobody is stopping her from going to the thrift shops and look herself.", "NTA\n\nPlus sized lady here, her speech was unnecessary and over the top.

Another plus size person here, things have come a long way for clothes for the larger person, and there are now a few ranges that cater for plus size people  (my joy in being able to buy tops I didn't need to shorten the arms on - for some reason, some brands seem to just enlarge existing sizes for the plus size and you get corresponding long arms with the wider width). Most ranges are available online, so for her to say she struggles to find clothes, has she bothered to look? Also as someone else has said, she didn't actually see the previous dress, just the size and scraps, so she has no way of knowing it would have looked good on her, as it sounds like you altered the style anyway.", "NTA., but your friend\u2018s sister thinks your are the AH for not giving her the plus size dress you found.
