However, you doing something kind for her sister doesn't make you the AH. If she had been with you while you shopped and asked you to please leave the dress for her it would be a different situation. If you're still feeling guilty maybe offer to shop with her and help with alterations if you have time. But even if you don't have time for that you're still NTA.\n\nAlso, I worked at a thrift store for almost a year, and the greater majority of thrift store clothing is either recycled or trashed so you \"rescuing\" the dress is great.", "NTA- it sounds like you made your friend a super cute dress and her sister is jealous.", "NTA. Hi, plus size person here. It is extremely hard to find cute clothes sometimes, especially at thrift stores. I thrift a lot, but I do think buying a dress or something else once in a while to alter it is fine. It would be different if you were only looking in the plus size section when you went thrifting and buying these clothes to alter was an everyday thing or you were buying hundreds of plus size items. It\u2019s ONE dress. She can get over it. Tell her Forever 21 does offer plus size as well so she could buy the dress there too if she wanted.", "NTA. As a plus sized baddie myself I have no problem finding clothes. \n\nThere was a time when anything over a size 10 was only moo moos and sweatshirts but there's literally several companies geared towards us curvier women.\n\nYour friends sister is lashing out because of her own insecurities; ignore her like your friend said.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, but if she texts again send her this list:\nMonifC\nCurvysense\nPrettylittlethings\nAshleystewart \nFashiontofigure\n\nAll carry plus size fashion", "Seriously NTA. She could have sent a text that went along the lines of 'totally love the dress you scored for my sister, the work you did looks great on her- keep an eye out for one for me!'

What's with that stupid level of entitlement she has? And \"stress all over again\"? You didn't take the dress away from her. She probably would've never found it anyway so she's just being confrontational about it for no reason. Ignore her, and move on. Tell her to go to Torrid or something and get over it.", "NTA. You did a nice thing for your friend. Her sister isn\u2019t entitled to your thrift finds.", "NTA what a bizarre and entitled response from her sister", "NTA.  Her sister sounds really entitled.

She honestly sounds kinda unhinged", "Her gripe about the fashion industry and beauty/health standards was misdirected at you. She may do better to take up thrifting / sewing as a part time hobby as well so that she can modify clothes. Her central concern is founded- clothing companies don\u2019t make it easy for all sizes/proportions to find outfits, even online. A fitting dress on the rack is a rare resource. It\u2019s not your fault that plus sized clothes are hard to find- it\u2019s designers and manufacturers. NTA- but i would def introduce her to sewing as well.", "NTA. I say this as a fat man.

You did something nice for your friend, and that message has more absurdity than I care to break down, so I'll confine myself to this: the woman doesn't even know that she would've liked the dress as originally purchased. For her to somehow assume that it would have been her perfect dress is pure nonsense.", "She didn\u2019t even see the original dress. \n\nOften a thrift store dress that looks awesome *after* tailoring is not particularly appealing in its original state. \n\nJust because your skill made something beautiful out of the material you saw, it does NOT mean that the original dress was attractive. \n\nChances are it wasn\u2019t - that\u2019s why it ended up in a thrift store.

As a plus sized woman myself I find her anger at this situation absolutely ridiculous. Yes it\u2019s extremely frustrating that not many stores carry clothes in larger sizes and it is even more frustrating that often the larger sized clothes that can be found aren\u2019t as cute or flattering as the straight sized clothing but that doesn\u2019t mean that literally every single piece of cute clothing in a large size found at a thrift store need to go to plus sized people just because we struggle to find clothes in normal stores.

However. Your friends sister is absolutely correct. Finding well made, affordable, fashionable clothes is extremely difficult for plus sized women. And due to this, clothes that size are rare to find in thrift stores since the people who own them usually hold onto them until they can't anymore.\n\nIt is fairly well accepted in the crafting community that if you're simply looking for a large amount of fabric, just buy the fabric and leave the clothing for people who actually need it. It's the ethical thing to do.", "Listen. This thread simply isn't going to give you much besides N T A verdicts and it's not that I think Y T A, but rather, there genuinely is a growing etuquette around how and when we seamstresses size down thrift store clothes. I'm going to go with NAH judgement for the following reasons:\n\n1) let's be perfectly honest. A lot of the people who go to theuft stores to buy clothes do so because they cannot afford to buy clothes unless they're second hand. I've spent most of my life poor enough that the only way I got new clothes was from a thrift store because if it cost more than $5 an item it simply wasn't going to happen. This means many of the people clothes shopping at thrift stores do not have the option to go somewhere where a comprehensive and varied stock of sizes and fits are available, and are limited to what happens to be donated. It can take multiple trips to come away with a single new outfit or even just a single item if you are a size that appears more rarely.\n2) there are a few different sizes that are pretty rare in thrift stores and if you have \"never seen a dress this big before\" then I guarantee you it's one of the rare ones. Try buying a wardobe in anything over a size 3x at a thrift store sometime and see how many visits it takes you to manage it. There are a lot of theories about why some sizes are more common than others at thrift stores, and that's its own interesting discussion, but regardless garments for very large people are a hard snag at modt thrift shops.\n3) poverty and being overweight have a correlation for a variety of reasons that don't actually matter a lot right now because the fact of the matter is overweight people are disproportionately likely to be living in the kind of poverty that makes thrift stores their only option for clothes shopping.\n4) as any seamstress knows, there's more work/coordination of aesthetic/materials/etc involved in the process of upsizing something than there is in the process of downsizing something which means that a large garment is easier to make small than it will be to make large again if that is not an anticipated change built into the pattern.\n\nTLDR: there is nothing inherently wrong with an individual buying a large size garment cheaply at a thrift store as materials for a smaller size garment project. The problem occurs when A LOT of people make the decision to do that and cause a considerable impact on an already extremely limited yet essential resource for a specific group of people. It's not like there's a level of overweight where the societal responsibility to wear clothes in public goes away, and it's not like plus size clothes often costing near double straight sizes when new is going to magically make poor people who are fat any less poor. Because of this, it is increasingly understood in thrifting communities that it's a bit of a dick move to substantially downsize clothes (e.g. more than 1-2 sizes) from thrift shops with any regularity. You're N T A, but neither is the person who is (admittedly not as gently as she could have, but given how personal and painful the clothes shopping experience can be for fat people maybe we give some grace there) trying to educate you about that etiquette when she realizes you may not know it. I don't think you meant any harm, but you should probably at least know why this is being considered part of thrifting etiquette because otherwise you may find yourself unknowingly contributing to some essential resource scarcity that can have a really emotionally and materially devastating impact on more people than you think.", "Nta but she\u2019s self loathing like she needs to let it go", "YTA it\u2019s been widely known for a while now that thinner people who tailor thrifted plus sized clothing is a shady move. And of course you didn\u2019t \u201cknow.\u201d You\u2019re not plus sized and neither is your friend. It seems neither one of y\u2019all consider her feelings or anything else.", "NTA", "NTA.

I find it almost impossible to find bras or jeans in my size because of the way I carry my weight. Yes, it sucks that the fashion industry is only just starting to cater to anyone over a 10 or anyone with \"not normal\" proportions. But none of that is on you and no one is ever entitled to a piece of clothing simply because of their size. The sad truth is that if she genuinely has this much trouble finding clothes that fit she either needs to start looking into making her own or researching better brands to buy from. A lot of them are more expensive but brands like Torrid are great quality and last for a long time. And as much as people don't want to hear it, plus size stuff is always going to be at least an little more expensive, it's more fabric.\n\nI understand this is all coming from her frustrations finding affordable clothes.

However, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole. As someone who\u2019s plus sized it can be hard to find clothes, but I\u2019m realistic.

She has some valid points about the plus size clothing industry, but the bottom line is THAT IS NOT YOUR PROBLEM.

She's jealous that her sister got an amazing, custom gift from you, and she's frustrated with herself over her body type. Once again, NOT YOUR PROBLEM.", "NTA\n\nI do think the sister is reacting to the popular trend of \"upcycling\" plus sized thrift clothes for social media clout.\n\nThat trend is pretty AH, but that's not what you did. You saw an item you wanted to alter for a friend, then got the item and did the alterations. Not for a single tiktok video or whatever, but because you genuinely thought your friend would love the item and get a lot of use from it. What you did is pretty much the reality of what thrifting is for people of any size to get quality, attractive clothes from thrifting. Clothes end up in thrift stores primarily because they are no longer fashionable or no longer fit correctly. This is even more true for plus size clothes. \n\nNow, this said, the sister has a fair point about plus size clothes being rare in thrift stores and expensive across the board. There is something to the idea of leaving those clothes for those who need them. Or, even better, if thrifting is a hobby, making sure those clothes get to those who need them by buying them and giving to friends/family or redonating to closets for those in need. If you're willing and able to help with minor alterations or repairs, even better. But, this is not an obligation. You don't have any particular duty to help plus sized people to not be an AH while thrifting clothes.", "NTA- but I can understand the sister jealously, its hard to find a dress being a plus size woman, but that's no excuse for the way she reacted.

If I was in that situation I'd maybe be frustrated, but that still wouldn't entitle me to the dress, it'd be more of a 'Damn, I really wish I'd found it first, my luck blows.'

But the larger problem she was talking about is a real thing. Which is why I didn't provide judgement.\n\nYou use less new fabric when you make clothing items for smaller people then you do larger people. And there aren't that many options avaliable for larger people to wear. This is one of those issues where you weigh the human factor to the possible environmental factor. Larger people usually only have access to clothes they can feel comfortable in from fast fashion sites that make poor quality clothes from slave labor, or ridiculously over priced brands that are practically exploitation. So to take an option away from them that allows them to actually make a choice about where and what type of clothing to buy, you are acting unethically.", "I think you'll find that people often have a strong emotional reaction when this concept comes into play: \"essential resource scarcity that can have a really emotionally and materially devastating impact on more people than you think.\"\n\nHer message actually seems pretty clearly to me *not about this specific dress at all* but rather about the pain and expense that she is experiencing beyond her capacity to cope with it. OP just happened to step on that nerve with her gift. As for \"snooping\", I'm prepared to be wrong, but OP's telling didn't seem to indicate to me that this was done sneakily or maliciously? I read it as maybe she was seeing if there were any more fabric scraps left usable because she also liked the pattern and happened across the tag. This might just be a product of how normal it is in seamstress circles to share scrap fabric, and me not seeing that as out of the ordinary in any way.

Often plus size clothing that isn't completely butt ugly is extremely expensive because you'd have to go to a brand that caters to people above a certain size. To see plus size clothing being bought up to be trendy and oversized in places like walmart or target (which are often our most available and cost efficient options, especially because it's extra difficult to buy plus size clothing online without trying it on first) is kind of frustrating. I can see where she's coming with it but the way that she addressed it and went about it was completely wrong.\n\nEdit:  It's also frustrating because as a woman if you have a professional job or work in a professional setting you're expected to look a certain way. Plus size women are often held to higher standards to not look \"sloppy\" and look put together, so when nice clothing that would work well in an office setting is out of stock in our size we are often forced to either dress more casual or wear size that doesn't fit as well- which can go against if we are seen as professional in a workplace setting. There are a lot of fashions that plus sized women would get read for as looking sloppy or not put together that on a smaller woman wouldn't be questioned. I can see why you finding a nice dress in a plus size only to trim it down and alter it to fit somebody that sister believes can just go to any store and find something off the rack would be frustrating to somebody who has probably been looking for nice clothes that fit them well and flatter them for a long time.

It's definitely something to think about.\n\nI'm torn about this because I hate for clothing to go to waste, I think it's important to reduce how much new clothing we buy, and it's always good to give thrifted clothing a new home. On the other hand, by cutting up a dress that someone else could have used intact instead of buying a secondhand dress closer to your own size, that's still wasteful in a different way. (Although I like that OP said they may be able to use some of the excess fabric for a swim suit.)\n\nI don't think OP was in the wrong here for getting excited about a pattern their friend would love and being crafty. But it's good to be aware of this issue and perhaps not make a habit of it, or save it for garments that aren't in good condition and would be destined for landfill (eg. something with a rip or stain that you can cut out by downsizing)", "I think someone mentioned a wedding dress from torrid or another store that was mentioned in comments as bring plus size friendly.

There's a lot more plus-size fast fashion -- and a lot of the \"fat tax\" price hiking that sometimes doubled the cost has largely been reduced.", "It's a \"well known thing\" in that, there was a trend for a while of people deliberately seeking out and purchasing plus sized clothing in order to alter it down. The trend specifically capitalized on plus sized clothing because it could give a ~shocking~ transformation; the \"look how I turned this /ugly/ horrible dress into something \u2728fashionable\u2728\", plus the fact that bigger dresses=more fabric to work with to make a bigger change.  It inspired a lot of people to go out and do the same thing... That combined with the difficulty many people experience in buying plus sized clothing made it an issue.

I'm average but curvy and depending on the store,  brand, point in my cycle, phase of the moon, etc I'm anywhere from an XS to a L (or XL in dresses if we're daring to play with that whole other sizing mess!)", "How did you even spot that autocorrect?? I'm super impressed!", "This balance is why the etiquette isn't \"never buy clothes larger than the minimum size you need at thrift stores\" but rather \"try not to make a habit of buying thrift shop clothes more than 2 sizes larger than you need\". It's important to measure the good decision of reusing or refreshing second hand garments with realistic understandings of our fellow thrifters' needs and experiences.\n\nFor what it's worth, I think a lot of people who worry about environmemtal impacts from the garment industry probably are working from information about \"textile waste\" which we tend to think of as clothes people buy and then throw away. But the vast majority of textile waste actually occurs before garments ever reach a customer, or sometimes even a store/outlet. The ethics of the garment industry as a whole are actually really fascinating to me as an anthropologist and seamstress, and also a bit scary as an environmentally conscious person. Fast fashion gets a lot of the airtime in environmental circles, but the industry as a whole is incredibly damaging to the environment, to human/labor rights, and to the relationships people have with clothing/\"style\". For anyone wanting to know more, I recommend looking into the \"wasteless garment\" concept/movement to learn about textile waste during garment construction, as well as the history of designer brands destroying billions of dollars of merchandise before it ever hits the sales floor in order to \"keep the brand exclusive\" and maintain their exorbitant price tags. It makes one unfathomably angry at clothiers, but also a bit less inclined to beat oneself up about making choices that leave the possibility of textile waste outside our immediate influence.\n\nThis is a long way of saying that upcycling is great and we should all do a lot more of it! But also, there is literally no way for us as consumers to upcycle our way out of environmentally devastating textile waste because most of that waste occurs along the shortcut points of the garment industry long before we ever set eyes on an item. Your decision to leave an oversized (for your needs) garment won't have a significant impact on the garment industry's environmental footprint, but *could* make a huge difference in the life of a plus size person who comes shopping after you. That doesn't mean you can never buy the item, but it does mean that if you choose not to and the garment doesn't get snagged by someone who needs it, you're not personally murdering Nemo.\n\nPersonally, if I'm going to the thrift store for just fabric as opposed to a garment to tailor, I usually just look in the curtain/linens bins. You can get a truly massive amount of fabric (that is way more likely than a fully constructed garment to go to waste and end up in a landfill) for dirt cheap, and the best part is absolutely no one gives a shit. Not to mention sometimes you find big panels of antique lace andthat's just good thrifting.", "Let's not get started on the lack of uniformity in sizes.\n\nMy MIL recently bought me jeans. 4 pairs.

She unloaded a lot of feelings on a person who had done a thing that, when it happens at scale, does real emotional and material harm to a lot of people's quality of life. As a single incident, yeah realisitically OP isn't doing anything wrong. But when you are the person on the receiving end of the harm done by a trend of casual disregard for your reality, it's not nearly as easy as you're suggesting to separate an \"individual who does the thing\" from \"the thing as a widespread phenomenon that causes harm\". It certainly would have been better if she could have calmly and kindly explained this. But generally, this reddit doesn't assign asshole status to people who are kinda overreacting/misdirecting a reaction to real harm they experience. There's often a note made that it could have been better handled, but it's common for us as redditors to say \"even though this could have been done better I don't think it's enough to call you an asshole because I understand how this reaction occurred\". If this woman had been violent, physically aggressive, repeatedly contacted/harassed OP about this, etc (or if she goes on to do any of these things), that's a very different story. But when we're talking about a friend casually participating in a social phenomena that genuinely harms you without recognizing the way that phenomena impacts your life, a single angry text message really isn't asshole territory.\n\nThat said, it can be reasonably hurtful/jarring to suddenly realize that something you did that seemed harmless has caused a friend/loved one pain. So it's also understandable for OP to feel stressed, concerned, and confused since her friend was obviously too emotional to explain why she was having that pain in an effective way. This seems like one of those AITAs where no one has really crossed any major boundaries yet, but there's some miscommunication or perspective difference that's creating tension and making people feel that boundary crossing may need to be headed off. Often, those can be managed with a gentle explanation of what may have happened and a good faith conversation.\n\nAs always, we're strangers with a single narrative regarding an event and I'm not going to pretend my opinion is 1000% perfect with no room for new info. I'm also fully aware I'm going against the grain of the thread's responses and that means a lot of people won't agree with me and that's fine! I'm not too worried about placing blame. But OP is also (at least partly) asking if this is a real concern they should remember because they've never heard about it before, and as a fellow seamstress who likes to thrift and IS familiar with how and why this etiquette is in place, I can offer some perspective/context that could help OP resolve this situation if it's resolvable, or refrain from making a future etiquette faux pas in this same arena if this current situation turns out to be unresolveable. Because realisitically, even if it turns out OPs friend was 100% the asshole in this situation, the next time OP runs into this question, they might genuinely be the asshole, and this thread's N T A comments will largely fail to provide them context as to why that's happening. OP should know that there will be other members of the thrifting seamstress/tailor community that won't think positively of what she did (not to mention WHY they may do so) so she can make informed decisions about how she wants to obtain materials going forward. Judicious use of large size garments from thrift shops is usually considered fair game. But if OP doesn't know that there's such a thing as overdoing it on that method of garment making, she doesn't know to be thoughtful about when she decides to do it, and that makes it a lot harder to avoid being the asshole in future.", "I have very bad news for you. Men's pants are starting to get into the \"size on label may not be correct\" game. It's not prevalent yet, but it's started.", "Ugh, I hear you.

I'm not invested in making you agree with me. OP is going to get a lot of validation that the text was hurtful and mean, so I don't think it's especially important for me to belabor that point. I also am not you, so obviously our criteria for what defines asshole behavior may have differences and I think that kind of variation in perspective/priority is a major part of why people utilize this subreddit. My perspective is that I know a lot of people who would find what OP did \"impolite\" for the reasons I listed, and a reasonable number of those who would even feel very hurt that if someone they considered a friend casually made that decision. Feeling hurt (especially when it's a \"death by a thousand cuts\" style hurt that gets aggravated in a million little ways by a ton of different people in their lives like this one is) can make people speak passionately and harshly about that hurt. In my opinion, there is often a gap period between that initial reaction and how someone follows up their initial reaction where AH criteria haven't been met yet and relationships can be brought back in sync. I like to give my responses from that angle, and thankfully there are usually plenty of other people in the thread with more rigidly protective boundaries/expectations of others! So I rarely have to worry about OPs missing out on that perspective/advice just because I am less inclined to provide it directly myself.\n\nAnd as I've said several times now, I still don't think the text was a great way to handle that hurt, and am fully aware that there's plenty of information or updates to the situation that might explicitly plant her in TA category for me. It's not like I think it's impossible for her to be TA. Just that from the info I've been given, this sounds like something their relationship could still come back from if OP wants that. OP may well not want that! In which case, hopefully the context I provided for how things may have gotten here (since OP expressed confusion and surprise about where the idea of refraining from upcycling clothes significantly larger than you need might come from) is helpful in other aspects of their life. Everyone's boundaries/threshhold for others' behavior is different and I have no intentions of assuming what OPs are or should be, just of providing OP information that may help her make that decision for herself.", ">Within online discussions, the vast majority of voices I see speak up on this subject\n\nExcept this very comment thread.

It\u2019s like the brand grew up with me!", "I feel like your response is what\u2019s needed for people who are truly asking if they are the asshole. Im kinda picking up on the vibe of \u201cI did nothing wrong\u2026 right?\u201d from this post. The \u201casshole\u201d might genuinely not know how to put their strong emotional reaction into words.\n\nIf we consider the asshole\u2019s feelings a little more, they might just be looking for affirmation that their issue is heard. And who knows, they might also be thinking about if they were being an asshole and want to resolve things.\nFrom reading some of your other posts, this is what I would say (in text) if I were op:\n\n \u201cI hear you, and I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t consider you or plus-sized people losing a dress when I bought it and changed it, it was a one time thing I was only thinking about friend. I don\u2019t want to stop being friends with you over this :( \n\nStill, you asking \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with me\u201d over me not realizing this is hurtful. I was just trying to do something nice and thought the dress was perfect for friend specifically, without considering size.\nStill, I genuinely hear your concern and won\u2019t ever source material from plus-sized clothes again.\u201d\n\nThey might take the chance to have a more calmed down and mature discussion. The \u201cyou did nothing wrong\u201d responses just tell OP not to even try IMO.\nHaving both sides talk it out, and both sides try to understand eachother is clearly the solution. \nSo it\u2019s way better for actually solving the conflict for at least some people give the \u201casshole\u201d the benefit of the doubt, Instead of just reaffirming OP did nothing wrong.\nLife\u2019s too short for pointless drama like that when they can just try to understand each other\u2019s feelings better. \nThey really just need to talk about it.\nI mean c\u2019mon, anyone can be an asshole sometimes, just talk, goddamn."]}
