They can also live for 40-60 years, so was he not gonna buy her any toys for this whole time? Jeez, what a miserable life.\n\nSounds like she hasn't had much attention from your brother, and is just responding positively to the person who is providing it.\n\nHe doesn't sound like a particularly caring or responsible pet owner since their intelligence is pretty well documented.

My friend, who inherited him from his mum, used to get upset because he'd try to bite everyone else, he'd be 'I'm the one to feed him, and he goes for me'.

Somebody is jealous.", "NTA. this parrot was bored and clings to you as you actually care about her!", "NTa. It's not the toys, the toys are a symptom.
