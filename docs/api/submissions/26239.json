I can link resources on spotting this and discouraging it if that helps. Also if you need resources on their proper care and diet. Be prepared to write her into your will!", "NTA. Congratulations on becoming a bird parent \ud83d\ude04", "NTA. Parrots are very intelligent and need stimulation and connection. I remember reading that African Greys are at about the same intellectual level as a 3-year-old child. Also, the parrot understood that you cared for her - you probably also spoke to her or tried to interact with her in other ways, and they understand that.", "I'm so glad you got to keep her. She's much better off with you. I'm also glad he realized he wasn't ready for a bird (at least he's better than the women that get horses just so they can \"show off\" how great they are before the horse blows up and bucks or kicks. Sorry mini rant) and at least she's got stimulation and hopefully won't pull her feathers.", "Nta but your brother is for not educating himself on the needs of an African grey or any parrot, I breed birds as a hobby, when people ask what they are like I simply tell them they are flying toddlers. they need constant attention a good routine and throw tantrums for no reason they sometimes have that one favourite toy that they take everywhere and will meltdown if they don\u2019t have it. If your not prepared to raise a toddler for the next 40-60years don\u2019t get a bird", "Excellent outcome", "Not sure if you saw OP\u2019s update", "Thanks! \n\nGlad to hear the bird is with OP now and that they have done research on how to properly care for it.", "One reason why I decided not to get a beautiful parrot was because they could outlive me. I heard they can get depressed and essentially have a shitty couple of decades to the end of their life because of that. Decided to get a dog because at least I know what to expect in 12-14 years and I can kind of try to deal with it. The parrot would have no idea.", "I believe the Japanese have been making great strides in this area....", "\ud83e\udd23 I vote for the toy frog. Im not a fan of spiders and still wouldn't wish this guy on one of them.", "Over years of having cats I've found that aside from appreciating the person who gives them food, they also seem to appreciate the person who cleans their litter boxes. And I mean of COURSE they know who that is since at least some of them stand around watching you like particularly intense gargoyles when you clean it!", "> I think the text implies that the question was \"What color am I?\" - at least, I think that would be an existential question, while \"What color is that?\" would not be one.\n\nFrom what I remember, the existential part is him recognizing that the thing in the mirror is him, and asking the question in order to learn more about himself. Introspection is I think what they discovered with Alex.\n\nThere's some speculation that certain Octopodes have the capability as well, though their brains are so different than ours it is almost impossible to tell.", "Personally, I think there's a difference between animals which have been domesticated for thousands of years (and are now considered different species from their wild ancestors) and birds that may have been bred in captivity but are essentially the same animal as those that are in the wild. But to each their own.\n\nAnd that's nice that some birds are bred in captivity, but there are still millions of birds worldwide that are captured and sold each year. \\*You\\* may not be encouraging the capturing of birds, but that doesn't mean it isn't happening.", "There is! r/torties. Have fun!"]}
