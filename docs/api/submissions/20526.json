Likely because she\u2019s had to go through a challenging (and expensive) and invasive process to carry a child not genetically related to her. Maybe she\u2019s hoping that having a blue-eyed baby who resembles both moms will prevent people from stopping her on the street asking where \u201cdaddy\u201d is or make her feel like she\u2019s not a proper parent.

It's not entirely logical, but the feelings are still there. It's also one more way they are different from straight couples, and something many people use to try and rationalize why same swx couples shouldn't happen.", "100% it has been a shit thing to go through, I'm glad they conceived in their first round of IVF! I have fertility issues myself and it doesn't matter how it comes about it's still a bummer.", "You\u2019re going off on a whole new tangent lol", "For some people eye color is a small thing, for others it's education or hight. For instance sperm banks in some places try to dissuade men who have red hair, are short or have no college education from donating. The latter two traits aren't even strictly genetic. So obviously most couples are pretty picky when it comes to their sperm donors.", "OP said she put off the process for a long time because she couldn\u2019t find a blue eyed donor. She wanted a child but spent who knows how long without one bc she couldn\u2019t be sure it would have blue eyes.", "No but you\u2019re randomly giving an unkind \u201cjoke\u201d in response to her anxieties. \n\nLook, I agree, ultimately kids are going to be how they are but honestly even the \u201call you should care about is a healthy baby\u201d thing is bullshit. What if the baby ISN\u2019T healthy? \n\nPregnancy is an anxiety provoking time, no matter how \u201cnormally\u201d it progresses. A lot of anxious people fixated on the things they perceive they can control, even if those things aren\u2019t actually in their control at all. \n\nI didn\u2019t read anything in her response or behaviours that lead me to believe she won\u2019t love the baby if their eye colour is something other than blue. Only that it\u2019s something she thought she could try to direct to some degree and your \u201cjoke\u201d unnecessarily needled her anxieties. The world is not necessarily friendly to queer parents and I\u2019m sure there are a bunch of things they\u2019re both concerned and/or anxious about. Standing from the outside in I can appreciate it seems silly, unfounded, superficial, even worrying to you. A genuinely empathically curious conversation of how to support her at the moment and into the future, especially if something goes unexpectedly, or worse, wrong, would be one thing. Deliberately aiming for something you can see is causing a friend anxiety - even if that anxiety seems misplaced or even wrong - is what makes TAH here. Anxiety often ISN\u2019T logical.", "\"If they came with horns\"... Ouch! \n\n^ \u2022_\u2022 ^", "As a fellow queer person, those people need therapy before they ever start IVF or the adopt process.", "No, I\u2019m not. They DID struggle to conceive a kid. Just because it wasn\u2019t a struggle in the \u201ctraditional\u201d way doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t a struggle.", "That's...kind of weird. Like the no college education, that's life choices by a person? A few steps away from measuring people's skulls lol.", "Joking man, they were little hellions from time to time as any kid can be!", "Part the reason she might be sensitive is because of the whole process of IVF. So it probably felt like an attack, even if that is not how you meant it.", "Part of the job description \"kids\", really ;D\n\nSorry for the mum-pun (like a dad joke but possibly worse), it was the thought of them being born with horns; ouch!\n\nI know, I know, *terrible* sense of humour!", "Hahaha I didn't even think of giving birth with horns parts! Awesome humor, I'm still half asleep myself and dim, lol"]}
