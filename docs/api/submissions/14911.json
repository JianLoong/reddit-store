I wouldnt recommend backing down on your stance. For any reasons.", "You must be in the PA bible belt (aka Pennsyltucky); there are plenty of state stores with Sunday hours in more civilized parts of the Commonwealth.", "NTA\n\nHere's an out of box suggestion: \nTell her mom (and sil, gf etc) if she can get a job and hold on to it for 6 months+, stop smoking and go to AA then you'll think about it. (hint do not think about it). \n\n If mom and sil, act offended then you can say sorry those are the terms. No negotiation. \n\nIf she says OK I can do all that, then in 6 months she should be in a better position to stand on her own 2 feet and other solutions can be offered by her Daughters, not you, ie helping her rent a place/trailer etc.", "If the girlfriend is unable to say no despite wanting to you seeming like a dick about it probably will help her here. You're the big bad guy who is the \"problem\" not her. They will leave her alone", "Good. So it's all your property and yours alone. That means if it comes to it, non-payers can be evicted if they're just verbal month to month tenants who dont pay a thing anyways", "She could still pay rent. When she lived in an apartment she wasn\u2019t on the title, but still paid. Just because she gives you money to pay to live with you does NOT mean she has any right to your house. Just don\u2019t let her directly pay the taxes or mortgage from her bank account.", "Also everyone who isn\u2019t making millions in America is being taken advantage of already.", "Lol I don\u2019t think a centrist would understand.

It\u2019s a shit state but we moved to southwestern Ohio and got a house on an 80k salary. And that was with me leaving my job and transitioning to self employment (artist).", "IF the house was his before the marriage it wouldn't in most cases.\n\nIE I have my own house right now. If I get married in say 10 years and divorced in 3 my house will be mine before and after the marriage.\n\nAs long as I didn't add potential future spouse to the deed for said house.\n\npre-marital property is in most cases immune from being given to the other party in a divorce.\n\nTheir are a lot of ways someone can protect themselves during a marriage. Having your own property with just your name. Separate bank accounts. etc...", "Well yes if it was acquired after marriage it\u2019s their house, I was thinking more in terms of \u201emorality\u201c.", "This is how my wife and I handled things back when she moved in with me. I was already paying all the rent and utilities, and I wanted to live with her, so I offered to just keep doing that, and she paid for fun stuff/saved more. If its already in your budget it doesn't feel like a big sacrifice for someone you love to move in with you without paying anything.", "She is paying his share of everything else. If his share of groceries is $300, for example, and she is paying that, that's allowing him to put $300 more towards the house, so she's indirectly paying for the mortgage. And she's not only paying for groceries of course. OP himself said that their combined income is what's allowing him to pay for that house, not just his own income", "i mean, if they\u2019re just doing the sit down in the house they can call the police cause she\u2019ll be trespassing if she doesn\u2019t leave, but that would effectively be the immediate end of that relationship.", "Why do you need to put 30% down? 20% is the standard and many people buy their first home with less than 20%.  \n\n$600 a month in property taxes is a lot though.", "Nah, I'm 28 and I've had a house for 2 years now in the Harrisburg area (not the city limits, suburbs).

That explains the walmart comment op made. If 80k is pretty well off, then the nearest Walmart is a heck of a hike to get to.", "Depending on the state, the increase in the value of the home during the marriage would be marital.", "I mean its smart he doesn\u2019t have her helping with the mortgage but I question the utilities.  I wouldn\u2019t want her to be able to claim equity in the home later.", "I pay 8000$ per year and I live in the poorest Canadian province....", "Live in Iowa...i also pay almost $7,000/year in property taxes.  It's ridiculous but it's even worse in IL.", "I was just talking about the liquor stores. Kind of shocked that Harrisburg doesn't have shops open on Sunday, especially considering our legislature.
