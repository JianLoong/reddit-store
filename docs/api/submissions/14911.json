She's been living in an an apartment for a few years prior to moving in here.\n\nWe make enough to live comfortably, we bring home around $80k combined and as a result I was able to buy a pretty big house for the two of us, nearly the size of my parents home. I alone pay the mortgage and utilities, since it's my house. Girlfriend has been generous enough to buy groceries, subscriptions, etc. She also paid for some of the furniture we have when we moved in.\n\nThe issue here came up about a week ago. Girlfriend's mom \"A\"  isn't well off, she lived in a trailer with her boyfriend and they broke up a few months ago so she'd been living with her mom and mom's husband. A's mom died a couple of weeks ago from cancer, and now her mom's husband is kicking her out. She has the possibility of living with my girlfriend's sister and her boyfriend (who live with the boyfriends parents), but A's been insistent on moving in with us. \n\nI am firmly against this. It's my house, I'm very much enjoying living on my own, and honestly, I don't want anyone else here. It's not my fault that her mom hasn't done anything to improve her financial situation, and I shouldn't be forced to endure her consequences of her actions. The fact that (to my knowledge) she isn't even looking at apartments, other trailers in that area, or a JOB just shows me that she intends to move in here and *stay* here. \n\nI can tell my girlfriend doesn't want that either, but wants to cave and ask me to allow it, though she's been avoiding the subject directly with me given the uncomfortable situation she's understandably in. I love her to death, but she's a massive pushover when it comes to her mom. She had me driving to Walmart to get food and cigarettes for her mom when we started dating, because her mom was too lazy to. \n\nMy girlfriend's sister has been saying I'm an asshole because we have a bigger house, and can easily take her in. I told her outright, \"it's not my mom, and not my problem\", which caused her to throw a tantrum on the phone, and she accused me of trying to make her mom homeless.

(she should save 50%-75% of any savings for herself first and then see what is left to support her mother).  GF sister should also partially support their mother.\n\nGFs mother needs to get a job asap and perhaps GF and GFs sister can support her rent for 6 months or so while she finds a job.
