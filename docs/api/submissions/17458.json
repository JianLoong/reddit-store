This is an absolute non-starter IMHO. You need a women-only gym, period. \n\nGyms are not like Starbucks. They aren\u2019t all the same, even for those who are not hijabis, and it\u2019s unrealistic and unfair for your family to expect you to give up your workout routine and the safe space you\u2019ve found for their convenience. \n\nThey\u2019re the ones asking YOU for a favor (helping your sister get started) and they should be going out of their way to make it easy for YOU.\n\nAt most, I\u2019d offer to meet them halfway to pick Sis up and she can take the bus home (or vice versa) assuming that even works with your schedule. That\u2019s going above and beyond. Bottom line, your comfort is just as important as your sister\u2019s and they\u2019re wrong to expect you to go to a mixed gym because it\u2019s easier for them.", "Your sister is disrespecting the fact that you are a hijabi and you prefer an all women gym.\n\nShe's only interested in what's easier for her, as she doesn't want to put in the effort of a longer commute. \n\nHer parents support her 'cause she lives with them and they hear her complaints AND they don't want to drive her. If you change gym they don't have to listen to your sisters antics.\n\nYou even offered an alternative (running in the park together), but that is not what she wants so like a whiny petty immature girl she's giving you the cold shoulder, trying to guilt you into doing what SHE wants...\n\nShe should grow up.\n\nNTA", "NTA. i get where your sister is coming from cause the only reason i don\u2019t go to the gym is cause none of my friends go to ones near my house. but i also haven\u2019t asked anyone to switch cause i know they all like their gyms. it\u2019s unrealistic and unfair of her to ask you to switch to a less comfortable gym because she\u2019s an 18 year old that can\u2019t drive yet (idk where you live but 18 with out a license sounds old to me). you feel comfortable and confident at your gym and don\u2019t want to switch which is perfectly okay!", "NTA . Finding a comfortable gym to work out in is hard enough.You have a gym you are happy with.  Don\u2019t set yourself on fire to warm others. I wish there was a womens gym I could go to near me but there isn\u2019t so I prefer to work out at home. That too is an option for your sister until she feels comfortable going on her own.", "NTA - You shouldn't switch up your routine for her. It'd be more practical for them to buy her a treadmill to use at home if she's that self-conscious.", "NTA. You put your terms and they weren't met so you aren't switching gyms. Simple. You are trying to be a good sister for her so in return she should be a good sister for you and understand your comfort matters too. If she's self conscious, she can try to work with a trainer (I know you stated she only trust you but she has got to make do in this situation) until she gets the hang of the gym, find a gym buddy among her friends or come to yours.\n\nMaybe she can come to yours for a month or so and when she feels confident, she can start one near her home.\n\nAnd your parents want convenience at the expense of your inconvenience. If they are worried about your sister's health, they can be her gym buddies too.\n\nEdited to fix a word", "NTA\n\nI think it's important for to be comfortable at the gym. I get why you don't want to switch, and I appreciate why your sister wants your support as she starts gym-ing. But I think there are other options than you switch gyms. \n\nThe two of you could look into guest passes for both your gym (maybe you pick her up, or your parents drive her if they want to support her), and one near your sister (maybe you can wear your park running gear for up to 10 visits, accompany her to the induction session, suss out some classes etc, and she'll be comfortable going alone once she's familiar with it).", "Not the asshole...it seems your sister is not self conscious..\nThere's no joys at your gym for her to flirt with...thats what it nails down to..as you stated you picked an only womens gym...who feel self conscious in there...its made to be supportive of all body shapes...its why its an all women's...keep doing you girl...change gyms for no one...she wants to go to those mixed gyms filled with creepy pervs...have at it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If the gym is not easily available for her, she can start exercise  with walking.  Lots of benefits.  Her parents can even join her.  Hopefully she is changing her diet to address her pre-diabetes.", "INFO - just wondering how difficult it would be for your sister to get her driving licence?   Seems as if that would sort all her problems out.", "Covered hair are more important than your sister. I understand...", "NTA. Your reasons are important too. If anything, you could go with her the first time so she sees it's fine, but then each go to the gym each prefers. I suppose you could wear modest clothes one time and your sister can see for herself that it ain't an easy task to do sport like that.", "You must be projecting cause OP clearly stated her sis is a lazy 18yo who's bothered by a really long commute to her gym -- the most obvious conclusion isn't that she secretly wants to meet gym bros... sheesh.", "No, you really don't.", "NTA.\n\nBut I feel like there's some other middle ground compromises that are worth exploring. What if your parents l pay for this new gym membership for 3-6 months. Then you and your sister can go 2-3x/week. You guys can build and establish routine for her. You can go to your regular gym the remaining days of the week. And at the end of 3-6 months your sister should be in a routine that she knows and comfortable enough with the gym to go on her own.\n\nI would definitely not give up your current gym. It offers you a huge benefit that you can't obtain anywhere else.\n\nAnd, type 2 diabetes isn't a disease of \"not working out\". If her/the family diet at home doesn't change, going to the gym may not be enough. It can slow the progression down. My favorite simple phrase is: abs are made at the gym and revealed in the kitchen. And: you can't outrun a bad diet.", "Nta. Your comfort is important, too. Don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.", "NTA. \n\nIf she has the time ever, maybe suggest she take the bus the first few times she goes with you until she\u2019s comfortable enough to go to a gym closer to her? That\u2019s really the only solution I can think of. \n\nAs someone who is overweight (but is now going to the gym everyday and losing weight!), gyms are intimidating. I can only imagine it for women, especially young women. It\u2019s scary. But the reality is that you just have to do it. That\u2019s really the best and only way to get over that hump if you don\u2019t have anyone to go with.", "NTA, but are there other options? Can she join you at your gym on the weekends, or stay with you over breaks to build her confidence in going so that she can transition to a closer gym? Sometimes it's just a need to get over the initial hurdle of actually going to help stop the stress associated with the gym.", "NTA. Stand firm. If you go to the gym 6 days a week, it is only reasonable that you stick to a gym that is close to your place, and one that you like. \n\nTell your sister to ask her friends for gym recommendations near her.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nIs your sister or are your parents willing to pay for you to go to a different gym? Maybe you can go to do a light workout and support her? \n\nBut really sounds like she needs a trainer", "And her sister is their child. It is her parents' responsibility to ensure that her health is taken care of. You need a safe space to work out. You have one. You have been going there longer. Regardless you should not have to change your gymn.\n\nEdited to change the fact that I thought she was a minor", "I can't think of abetter place for her to work out than a women's only gymn if she is uncomfortable. NTA", "Oh yes, my sister's endocrinologist made that very clear to her and our parents.  She has definitely made some major diet changes. She's just trying to incorporate exercise into her routine as well :)", "No, you don\u2019t understand at all.", "All the more reason for her to buy a cheap car. The US public transport system isn\u2019t robust enough to easily navigate life as an adult in many cities and having a car is a necessity for many jobs and/or educational opportunities", "That's great to hear! I just hate to see people try so hard and not see changes.   I would definitely push for them paying for the second gym membership, as long as you're willing to make the extra drive and work out at a different gym a few times a week.  If they complain about the cost, ask them what will be cheaper: a gym membership for a few months or her first year of insulin injections.", "I have a slightly unrelated question. I\u2019ve never heard the term hijabi. I understand it but is it one of things that you can say about yourself but is an insult if someone else uses it? Or is it a common thing?", "NTA. It is great that she is taking care of herself. If there isn't a gym that fits her needs, maybe she needs to look at different workouts she can do at home, or a boot camp she can join in the park. Taking away your routine is not the way to set up her own.", "No. Don't sacrifice your comfort for your parents convenience.\n\nETA sis needs to learn to drive and get a car.", "NTA - She is 18 time to get her license. You don't ask a favor of someone and then expect them to change everything and make all the concessions. I guess if you are feeling nice you can go pick her up or drop her off and she can bus the  other half of the trip but even that is going above. if she doesn't go to the gym 'because' of you then that to me is just her using it as an excuse. which still makes you NTA", "NTA stay at the gym you are comfortable in, and you have a very good reason to stay there.  You have offered alternatives to her, and she's refusing to consider them.  She is your parents' child and they are responsible for bringing her, they can't expect you to change for her.\n\nWhy can't she come to your gym once a week to learn the equipment and feel more comfortable, and then go to one close to her when she feels like she can?", "Definitely NTA.  You have a specific need in a gym environment.  If there were a closer facility that met that need and you just refused,  then you would be an AH. But that is not the case here. \n\nIf she wants to work out with you, she can make the effort. Or she can work out alone. Put your Big Sister Guilt away.  It's misplaced. \n\nThey're not asking you to sacrifice a creature comfort. They're asking you to sacrifice a piece of your faith", "Agreed. Hell, I go to Planet Fitness and although I use different locations in my area, I definitely prefer one because the atmosphere is way better. And my reasoning for preferring one over the other is nothing to your reasons for wanting to stay with your gym. You need to be comfortable where you're working out, and for your family to disregard your preferences is unacceptable", "No, anyone can say it. It's not insulting. It's just a term used to refer to Muslim women who wear hijab :)", "If that was your takeaway from this, then you clearly dont understand lol", "TRUTH.\n\nTBH after one session with all of the grunting dudebros and spunky spandex at a regular gym the sister will be *begging* to come to OP\u2019s gym.", "Thank you. I\u2019m also from a very conservative community, so I was curious how that played. There\u2019s lots of nuances and lines within these communities.", "NTA- there are also lots of at home work out programs that are free on the internet. I like the popsugar fitness ones. There are also paid program apps galore too. She doesn\u2019t have to go to the gym to reach her fitness goals. Maybe you can go over to their house and try a few out together if the guilt is eating you up", "NTA. You have found a safe and comfortable space for you to work out. Her goal is a bit different - she wants a local convenient place and for you to support her in that, although it's inconvenient for you and you wouldn't feel comfortable. \n\nYour offer is reasonable. I suggest she join a few classes at a local to her gym, where she will meet other beginners, and they can support each other.", "NTA - but here's another potential comprise, although your offer to run with her on the weekends was also a solid option.   \nOffer to visit other gyms with her, scout them out for a good vibe/culture, and see if they have a \"member + guest\" option (planet fitness in our area does; I can go with my BF anytime he visits for free). Then, maybe once a week, you can go to her gym together without increasing your monthly membership costs. Since you were willing to give up a gym day to run outside in the park, guessing a co-ed gym visit using the same schedule might work ok instead?   \n\n\nAnother option - see if you can go at the same time to your own gyms, and meet after for catch up? Or video call and talk about your workouts went that day? A way to include yourself in her journey while still respecting boundaries. Good luck!!", "NTA\u2026if she is that afraid of going to a gym, there are many things she can do at home.  There are so many free YouTube videos.  She has no excuses.", "Maybe she can join the gym she wants and you can see about getting or paying for a guest pass for 5 days or something so that you can go with her in the beginning", "NAH.  you jave the right to go to any gym you want. Your sister sounds like shes need s a helping hand for a bit as shes uncomfortable.  Maybe your mom can join the gym and go with her instead. Or a friend", "NTA.  Of course your parents want you to switch, they don't want to cart her around.", "NTA.  I don't know where you live, but as a hijabi, your safety and comfort comes before your sister's convenience.  Is there any reason she hasn't learned to drive yet?  It sounds like that could be the answer to everything.", "I do not wear a hijab and find it easier to go to a women's gym. It's different, less competitive and no sex or innuendo than one with mixed genders. \n\nI do not blame OP for holding to her preferences.\n\nHowever, having a teenager be diagnosed as pre-diabetic makes working out more critical. \n\nAre there any classes for yoga or tai chi or barre nearby to your sister? I lived in a town that opened the high school gym 3 times a week and it was super cheap to go - they had volleyball, weight machines, and usually a pickup game of basketball - I would do three circuits on the weights then play volleyball. Sometimes, you just need to start moving and get in the habit of healthier choices.\n\nDoes sister own a bike? Roller blades? There must be other options.", "Her comfort is more important than her sister not wanting a longer commute. I'd say the same even if OP wasn't a hijabi", "Braindead take.", "NTA, but if you want to you could offer to go with her to the gym of her choice for the first time, just so that she gets over that mental hurdle. Hopefully, when she sees that it's not as bad as she fears, she'll be able to go alone. You definitely don't have to do this, but I think that's what I would offer to my sister in this situation.", "NTA...by making you the ONLY person that can help her on this health journey \\*dramatic swoon\"...she is essentially setting you up to be held responsible by your parents when she doesn't do what SHE needs to do. That is the bottom line...you are NOT responsible for her or her choices or her health, it's great that she feels like the two of you could have great workout together, but it absolutely is not on you to have to facilitate that at GREAT inconvenience to you and a total loss of YOUR OWN safe space. This is an attempt to make someone else responsible for the success or failure of her plan to get healthy and she's willing to throw a hissy fit to get it. Just know that if you give in, that you are setting yourself up to ALWAYS be the bad guy and she will just always throw hissy fits to get her way.", "NTA", "NTA. Seems to me like she's trying to set you up as the one to blame if her fitness journey fails.", "Honestly, I can\u2019t with all the handholding people are asking for or expecting on AITA lately. I moved across Europe at her age, lived on my own, was responsible for my own cooking, cleaning and housekeeping. Being a bit intimidated is not fatal; your sister should be able to join a simple gym without family supervision. NTA.", "NTA.  She's being unreasonable.", "That\u2019s so cool Volleyball after working out sounds much more enticing then just working out"]}
