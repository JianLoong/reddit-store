I'm a hijabi so it's really nice to be able to exercise without worrying about what I'm wearing. I've been going there for years and I have no intention of changing my gym. But I live alone, while my sister is living with our parents. The gym is about a 35 minute drive from my parent's house. Since my sister can't drive yet, someone will have to take her and get her from the gym. If she takes the bus, the commute would be well over an hour each way. \n\nMy sister proposes we find a gym that's somewhere in the middle between our parent's place and mine. I said if there's a women only gym I might switch, just for her. However, all the gyms in that area are mixed. Mixed gyms don't really bother my sister because she isn't a hijabi so she generally just wears what she likes. This is where I feel really bad. She begged me to switch gyms for her (big sister guilt is really seeping in here) because she really feels like she can't do it alone and I'm the only one she trusts to help her, and not make fun of her (she said this because I had asked her whether she had a friend that she'd feel comfortable going with and she said no). \n\nMy parents want me to switch gyms as well, because 1) it'd be easier for them to drop her off and pick her up and 2) the reason why she's on this fitness journey is because she had been diagnosed with pre diabetes last year so if this is the only way she's willing to hit the gym they think I should do it. \n\nI told her that she's welcome to join me at my current gym if she likes, but if she can't I can run with her in the park on weekends but that's my final offer.

This is an absolute non-starter IMHO. You need a women-only gym, period. \n\nGyms are not like Starbucks. They aren\u2019t all the same, even for those who are not hijabis, and it\u2019s unrealistic and unfair for your family to expect you to give up your workout routine and the safe space you\u2019ve found for their convenience. \n\nThey\u2019re the ones asking YOU for a favor (helping your sister get started) and they should be going out of their way to make it easy for YOU.\n\nAt most, I\u2019d offer to meet them halfway to pick Sis up and she can take the bus home (or vice versa) assuming that even works with your schedule. That\u2019s going above and beyond. Bottom line, your comfort is just as important as your sister\u2019s and they\u2019re wrong to expect you to go to a mixed gym because it\u2019s easier for them.", "Your sister is disrespecting the fact that you are a hijabi and you prefer an all women gym.\n\nShe's only interested in what's easier for her, as she doesn't want to put in the effort of a longer commute. \n\nHer parents support her 'cause she lives with them and they hear her complaints AND they don't want to drive her. If you change gym they don't have to listen to your sisters antics.\n\nYou even offered an alternative (running in the park together), but that is not what she wants so like a whiny petty immature girl she's giving you the cold shoulder, trying to guilt you into doing what SHE wants...\n\nShe should grow up.\n\nNTA", "NTA. i get where your sister is coming from cause the only reason i don\u2019t go to the gym is cause none of my friends go to ones near my house. but i also haven\u2019t asked anyone to switch cause i know they all like their gyms. it\u2019s unrealistic and unfair of her to ask you to switch to a less comfortable gym because she\u2019s an 18 year old that can\u2019t drive yet (idk where you live but 18 with out a license sounds old to me). you feel comfortable and confident at your gym and don\u2019t want to switch which is perfectly okay!", "NTA . Finding a comfortable gym to work out in is hard enough.You have a gym you are happy with.  Don\u2019t set yourself on fire to warm others. I wish there was a womens gym I could go to near me but there isn\u2019t so I prefer to work out at home. That too is an option for your sister until she feels comfortable going on her own.", "NTA - You shouldn't switch up your routine for her. It'd be more practical for them to buy her a treadmill to use at home if she's that self-conscious.", "NTA. You put your terms and they weren't met so you aren't switching gyms. Simple. You are trying to be a good sister for her so in return she should be a good sister for you and understand your comfort matters too. If she's self conscious, she can try to work with a trainer (I know you stated she only trust you but she has got to make do in this situation) until she gets the hang of the gym, find a gym buddy among her friends or come to yours.\n\nMaybe she can come to yours for a month or so and when she feels confident, she can start one near her home.\n\nAnd your parents want convenience at the expense of your inconvenience. If they are worried about your sister's health, they can be her gym buddies too.\n\nEdited to fix a word", "NTA\n\nI think it's important for to be comfortable at the gym. I get why you don't want to switch, and I appreciate why your sister wants your support as she starts gym-ing. But I think there are other options than you switch gyms. \n\nThe two of you could look into guest passes for both your gym (maybe you pick her up, or your parents drive her if they want to support her), and one near your sister (maybe you can wear your park running gear for up to 10 visits, accompany her to the induction session, suss out some classes etc, and she'll be comfortable going alone once she's familiar with it).", "Not the asshole...it seems your sister is not self conscious..\nThere's no joys at your gym for her to flirt with...thats what it nails down to..as you stated you picked an only womens gym...who feel self conscious in there...its made to be supportive of all body shapes...its why its an all women's...keep doing you girl...change gyms for no one...she wants to go to those mixed gyms filled with creepy pervs...have at it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If the gym is not easily available for her, she can start exercise  with walking.  Lots of benefits.  Her parents can even join her.  Hopefully she is changing her diet to address her pre-diabetes.", "INFO - just wondering how difficult it would be for your sister to get her driving licence?   Seems as if that would sort all her problems out.", "Covered hair are more important than your sister. I understand...", "NTA. Your reasons are important too. If anything, you could go with her the first time so she sees it's fine, but then each go to the gym each prefers. I suppose you could wear modest clothes one time and your sister can see for herself that it ain't an easy task to do sport like that.", "You must be projecting cause OP clearly stated her sis is a lazy 18yo who's bothered by a really long commute to her gym -- the most obvious conclusion isn't that she secretly wants to meet gym bros... sheesh.", "No, you really don't.", "NTA.\n\nBut I feel like there's some other middle ground compromises that are worth exploring. What if your parents l pay for this new gym membership for 3-6 months. Then you and your sister can go 2-3x/week. You guys can build and establish routine for her. You can go to your regular gym the remaining days of the week. And at the end of 3-6 months your sister should be in a routine that she knows and comfortable enough with the gym to go on her own.\n\nI would definitely not give up your current gym. It offers you a huge benefit that you can't obtain anywhere else.\n\nAnd, type 2 diabetes isn't a disease of \"not working out\". If her/the family diet at home doesn't change, going to the gym may not be enough. It can slow the progression down. My favorite simple phrase is: abs are made at the gym and revealed in the kitchen. And: you can't outrun a bad diet.", "Nta. Your comfort is important, too. Don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.", "NTA. \n\nIf she has the time ever, maybe suggest she take the bus the first few times she goes with you until she\u2019s comfortable enough to go to a gym closer to her? That\u2019s really the only solution I can think of. \n\nAs someone who is overweight (but is now going to the gym everyday and losing weight!), gyms are intimidating. I can only imagine it for women, especially young women. It\u2019s scary. But the reality is that you just have to do it. That\u2019s really the best and only way to get over that hump if you don\u2019t have anyone to go with.", "NTA, but are there other options? Can she join you at your gym on the weekends, or stay with you over breaks to build her confidence in going so that she can transition to a closer gym? Sometimes it's just a need to get over the initial hurdle of actually going to help stop the stress associated with the gym.", "NTA. Stand firm. If you go to the gym 6 days a week, it is only reasonable that you stick to a gym that is close to your place, and one that you like. \n\nTell your sister to ask her friends for gym recommendations near her.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nIs your sister or are your parents willing to pay for you to go to a different gym? Maybe you can go to do a light workout and support her? \n\nBut really sounds like she needs a trainer", "And her sister is their child. It is her parents' responsibility to ensure that her health is taken care of. You need a safe space to work out. You have one. You have been going there longer. Regardless you should not have to change your gymn.\n\nEdited to change the fact that I thought she was a minor", "I can't think of abetter place for her to work out than a women's only gymn if she is uncomfortable. NTA", "Oh yes, my sister's endocrinologist made that very clear to her and our parents.  She has definitely made some major diet changes. She's just trying to incorporate exercise into her routine as well :)", "No, you don\u2019t understand at all.", "All the more reason for her to buy a cheap car. The US public transport system isn\u2019t robust enough to easily navigate life as an adult in many cities and having a car is a necessity for many jobs and/or educational opportunities", "That's great to hear! I just hate to see people try so hard and not see changes.   I would definitely push for them paying for the second gym membership, as long as you're willing to make the extra drive and work out at a different gym a few times a week.  If they complain about the cost, ask them what will be cheaper: a gym membership for a few months or her first year of insulin injections."]}
