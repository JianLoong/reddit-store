{"id": 28513, "submission_id": "17305qt", "title": "AITA for not babying my drunk boyfriend?", "selftext": "I (26F) and my boyfriend (23M) went to my brothers (25M) birthday party yesterday. I came all the way from my internship in the neighboring country, which was over an 8 hour commute by train. I stayed one night and I'm now on my way back.\n\nAround 20 people showed up and most of us were outside smoking, drinking and chatting. It was a lot of fun. I was on the verge of drunk, but I slowed down my drinking and drank water inbetween. My boyfriend however doesn't drink often and doesn't know his limits. At some point I could tell he was slurring his words, so I told him at least 5-10 times to stop drinking, but he kept dismissing my concerns. I took his beer from him multiple times to drink from it, only for him to grab another one from the fridge when it was empty. While one of my brothers friends and I were cleaning afterwards, he mutters \"I think I had one too many...\". He then threw up in the bathroom and passed out in the spare bedroom.\n\nThe next morning he has a massive hangover. The plan was for my brother to drop my boyfriend and me off at central station, where my boyfriend would go back home, and I would go back to the neighboring country. But on our way there, we had to stop 3 times for him to vomit more. We left fairly early, because I planned to take the train at 2:20pm, which would mean I would be back home around 9:30pm, giving myself a little bit of leeway if trains get delayed. However, because we had to stop multiple times, I missed the first train and had to wait another hour for the next. We drove to my brothers place, where my boyfriend started vomiting again and then asked if I could make him some tea. I told him I didn't have any without checking because I was furious with him. He passed out on my brothers bed, while my brother was planning on taking a nap himself. He is upset with him as well, because my boyfriend kept asking him to stop in places where he couldn't, passed out on his bed, and asking us to go out of our way to accomodate him constantly. I didn't check on him once it was too far gone, and I didn't do anything to help with his hangover.\n\nMy brother walked me to central station and we decided it would be best if I take the expensive fast train, because as a woman, you don't want to be walking around central station alone that late at night in that city. I paid \u20ac70 for the ticket, and while my brother offered to pay half, he thinks my boyfriend should be the one to cover it. \n\nI vented about this online, and was berated for being an awful girlfriend and that everyone makes mistakes. I was told to be an AH. I just don't see it that way. After I told him to stop drinking many times, after I took his beer from him, pushing my own limits by drinking more than I intended so I could help him, I don't feel it is my job to now baby him. I'm furious with him, and I think rightfully so. But after the response I got, I would like to get some more opinions.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1696774441, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17305qt/aita_for_not_babying_my_drunk_boyfriend/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

After all thetroublee you took to be with him, he went off on a bender and ignored your advice to stop drinking. If this is a one-time event, not part of an ongoing pattern, and your boyfriend understands why it's a problem and tries to  do better (many ifs) he might be worth keeping, but this behavior is not something you should enable.", "NTA why would you be, I mean your brother was more concerned about your safety than your albeit hungover boyfriend. \n\nHave you talked about limits? Have you set boundaries? You need to talk like grown adults for this to honestly work.", "NTA but your boyfriend is. Its just childish really. This is not a mistake this a deliberate risk and F\\*\\*k up.  A mistake is when things didn't go as expected. But getting black-out drunk and then feeling like crap is the predictable cause and effect.  Throwing up at some one elses place is digusting and he should be applogizing. To then do it a few more times next to the car is just ridiculous.", "NTA.   Your brother had no choice but to stop because a car full of hang-over vomit is rather unasthetic.  However, your boyfriend should have paced himself better.  Hopefully, he'll have a hangover that will teach him a lesson.", "Sooooo NTA. Your boyfriend is a grown man making terrible choices", "NTA - You are not an awful girlfriend for looking out for yourself. I completely understand why you would be angry with your boyfriend after repeatedly telling him not to drink more, and then having to miss out on things you planned to do because of him. I think it's fair for your boyfriend to be the one to cover the cost of your train ticket, since he is the reason you needed to purchase it. In the future, it may be helpful for you to set some boundaries with your boyfriend to avoid situations like this again.", ">I vented about this online\n\n~~INFO:~~  Anonymously, as on this sub? Or on your own social media?\n\nNTA based on details below.", "NTA, and having been the AH in a similar scenario, the best thing for your BF is to suffer through a miserable hangover and think about how he fucked up.  Hopefully he'll learn his lesson and be more responsible next time.", "NTA. Don\u2019t enable irresponsible behaviors.", "NTA - Bf *should* pay for the ticket. And hopefully he learns a lesson and wisens up.", "Sometimes alcohol can really wreck a person. \n\nHe didn\u2019t know this was the case? Then no assholes. Unfortunate circumstances but no assholes. \n\nIt\u2019s a learning lesson for all involved. I would set a limit next time. \u201cI am not going to take care of you if you get that drunk again. If you drink more than x drinks I\u2019m not going to see you for several days.\u201d Or whatever boundary works. \n\nAlso\u2014I\u2019m sorry you had a shitty time. Babysitting an adult who is drinking is not fun. Cleaning up puke is horrible.  Feeling resentment sucks.", "ESH. You say that your bf doesn\u2019t drink often and doesn\u2019t know his limits. That gives him a little bit of sympathy from me. Being this hungover is awful! I\u2019m sure he learned a lesson. The total lack of empathy from your brother and you, as his gf, is troublesome. This is not your bf\u2019s normal behaviour.", "NAH. Not even close.", "I'm surprised by all the NTA. He doesn't know his limit, it's not like he perpetually goes too far. Plus : he passed out. That's when you should have taken him to a hospital. Sure he can participate to your expenses after, but really, when people pass out from alcohol you have to bring them to a doctor, and be angry later. YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
