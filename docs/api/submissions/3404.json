It was his group of guy friends, some of our mutual friends, and one of my very close girlfriends, Claire. \n\nThere was one guy there that I know but that didn\u2019t go to school with us, and Claire really liked him. This guy is attractive and I could tell he liked her back, so I tried to set them up. It worked and they ended up leaving together.\n\nI told my bf today I was happy for her and he said \u201cone night stands are not an accomplishment for women\u201d. I asked him if he would be happy for his guy friends if they left the bar with a girl. He said \u201cI guess but I\u2019d think the girl was easy\u201d. These are direct quotes from our texts. \n\nI asked him how it\u2019s different and he explained that most guys at bars are always trying to hook up, so the ball is in the girls court, therefore if they do hookup it\u2019s the *girl* who is easy. Since she made the decision. Lol. \n\nI think it\u2019s one thing to judge casual sex and another to place all of the responsibility on women. So I called him sexist and told him I was disgusted with him. He obviously was pissed at this because he believes that his logic makes perfect sense and that I\u2019m TA. I think he also judges me for encouraging Claire to get with this guy, as if she\u2019s not a 22 year old single woman living her best life. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to think or feel honestly. I\u2019ve been dating this guy for over 4 years and have never felt this unattracted to him. I\u2019m just so confused.

You're a virgin? You're a prude. You like casual sex/hookups? You're easy. Men don't want to have to \"teach\" a virgin how to please them in bed but don't like women with the same body counts as them. MAKE IT MAKE SENSE. If he's so concerned with how easy girls are, then maybe he should put more effort into telling his guy friends to keep it in their pants more often.\n\nAlso, I'd tell him maybe he should learn to value \"easy women\" because he's certainly not getting in bed with me with all that misogyny.", "You're NTA. His views are a sexist double standard.", "NTA - He said something sexist, and you called him out for it.", "NTA.  He is being sexist.  How is the guy who is looking for easy sex easier than the girl they met at the bar?  \n\nAnyone of any gender can go to a bar looking for a one night stand!  And it\u2019s fine", "NTA. We are supposed to expect this behavior of men but we slut shame women they do it to? Lol no. Claire did nothing wrong. You did nothing wrong. I\u2019m surprised his sexist views haven\u2019t revealed themselves before now.", "NTA. When someone shows you their real self. Believe them.", "NTA: if the shoe fits\u2026 as the quote goes. \n\nYour boyfriend\u2019s logic is very misogynistic and sexist. The belief that men can freely hook up with others casually and not be deemed easy, or loose or anything else derogatory is not only misogynistic, it\u2019s also why women are still very much discriminated towards in society.  \n\nWomen are 50/50 partners in sex. Just because they say \u201cyes\u201d to a hook up, does not make them more responsible, thus easy, since  they made the decision to take someone up on the offer that was extended to them first.  It takes two to tango. So, why wouldn\u2019t it make a man \u201ceasy\u201d if he asked for sex if He initiated the offer first? She wouldn\u2019t have an opportunity to say \u201cyes\u201d and give a final decision without his offer first.  \n\nAnd let\u2019s call it all out here. Even if she was the one who asked first, the other person still made the decision to say yes,  so it\u2019s still a two way street.", "So, he\u2019s saying that all men and some women are easy, but only the women deserve to be judged.

Who do people who think that imagine straight guys are having one-offs with??  Magical sex fairies in the shape of human women?", "NTA but you have to realize the way he views other women is how he actually views *you*", "NTA, he is absolutely being sexist lol", "NTA. He\u2019s sexist.", "NTA. He has two different standards, one which praises men for and degrades women. That\u2019s what sexism is. His logic is sexist. But you\u2019re not going to change his mind, you know why? Because you\u2019re a woman and you don\u2019t know better than he does. \n\nGood luck with that.", "NTA\n\nHis double standard IS sexist. To be specific, it has roots in the Cult of Domesticity and the Madonna/Whore Complex. He see's women who embrace their sexuality as less deserving of respect than women who don't. He can be mad all he wants but the fact that you called him out on it is not an asshole move.", "What a dick - he is clearly intentionally belittling both Claire and the attractive guy's mutual happiness because... he's a dick? Or jealous of the guy who can pick up girls? Or likes Claire more than you know? Hard to say. \n\nBut he's a dick. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Go with your gut. He\u2019s sexist as hell. You have a lot of thinking to do.", "NTA. You're absolutely right in your logic and this is a huge red flag for how he views the balance of power in relationships in general. It's likely that in his mind, he's acting a role right now to woo you and keep you, and if you ever get locked in with kids/marriage, he'll shift to treating you different and expecting you to play the role of the domesticated mother/wife.", "NTA, you called him a sexist because he was being sexist - pure and simple, cut and dry.", "NTA\n\nWhat he said is sexist.", "NTA, you called it for exactly what it is.", "NTA and you deserve to be with someone better. Who knows what other sexist beliefs he holds.", "NTA.\n\nAnd you know full damn well he'd be calling the woman a prude if she refused to hook up. He's sexist and would be on the sidelines being a jerk if the woman said no to his buddy and he'd be calling her a prude and stuck up. He's not a good man.", "NTA.  Unfortunately, a lot of people think that way.  You aren't going to agree with anybody on everything.  My spouse and I have huge disagreements on important issues.  You have to decide what is important to you.  I would explore this issue and see how deep the sexism goes.  Only you can decide what you can live with.  Because there is always something...", "NTA. Double standards and hypocrisy based on gender is the definition of sexism.", "NTA\n\nSex is fun. It is, or should be, enjoyable for both parties. Women want casual sex just like guys. Why the fuck is this an issue in twenty-fucking-twenty-two?", "NTA. I've seen that argument before, Incels say that all the time.", "He is sexist to both genders. Men are only thinking about sex and will never say no and women should be prim and proper and never be involved in one night stands. \n\nDude doesn\u2019t use logic he is just an AH.\n\nNTA", "NTA but calling your bf an asshole wouldn't be exactly accurate either, he's more of a dumbass.", "NTA unless you keep dating the misogynist.", "As a man, I agree with others. His views are sexist. So long as Claire makes sure she is protected, nothing wrong with casual consensual sex.", "NTA. When someone shows you who they really are, believe them.", "NTA\n\nI understand where the general idea comes from. In the olden days it was the woman who tended to take on that responsibility out of self-preservation because men could just deny they had sex with them and would generally be believed. And the woman had no choice but to have the baby, her life likely being ruined in the process.\n\nNowadays it should be seen exactly opposite though. Men should be gatekeeping sex. Once they do the deed they have no control over what happens after that (and rightly so.) No running from a paternity test or child support.\n\nI will say that at 22-23 I also probably had some not great viewpoints. Having bad views shouldn't be a dealbreaker, but being unwilling to listen or unable to understand why they are bad if explained is something else. I've had several \"well fuck\" moments in my life realizing I had believed some really shitty things as long as I could remember.", "Is this an Andrew Tate vs. feminist episode in real life?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A great deal of men will fuck almost anything and anyone, they can get off with very minimal effort, everything that fits the definition of easy is much more applicable to a man.\n\nIf some really average looking girl came up to a man at a club offering \"easy\" - which is better defined as casual - mutual sex, many men in the club will jump on it. Comparatively an average looking man approaching a woman at a club has a much smaller chance of that encounter resulting in casual sex. Ask how many girls you know who have had men looking for sex at a club and how many times they bit compared to how many times men have been asked, how many times men have been the asker and been rejected, etc\n\nI repeat, if we're going to use a word \"easy\" as a demeaning method of people who enjoy casual sex - it is FAR more applicable to men in every sense.\n\nGet rid of \"easy\" unless you're going to use it both ways. Casual sex is casual sex and no consenting party is less than the other just because they happen to be a woman.", "I think the word \u201ceasy\u201d in this case is not used to compare between the 2 genders, rather to compare each gender to their own group. Because yes, if you were to compare between men and women, then yes, men are generally more \u201ceasy\u201d than women.\n\nHowever, the way the word \u201ceasy\u201d is generally used in this sense is to compare how \u201ceasy\u201d a man or woman is compared to other men and women, respectively. A woman is considered \u201ceasy\u201d if she openly invites sex because other women generally don\u2019t do that.

Tf?", "Then call her a gd UNICORN in appreciation of her \"rarity\"\n\nLet's not pretend like easy isn't meant to be demeaning, like it's an arbitrary comment based on a statistical \"anomaly\"\n\nEven if we're going to play devil's advocate and say that this term isn't meant to be derogatory (which I would HIGHLY contest based on the other types of comments men make when referring to \"easy\" women) then make it fucking positive.\n\n\"Oh she's easy\" makes it seem like a character flaw in the women because she happens to enjoy casual sex. Maybe be like \"Oh damn, she actually likes casual sex, what a fucking UNICORN\" or something ffs."]}
