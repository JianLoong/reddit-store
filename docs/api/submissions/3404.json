There's so much wrong with his behaviour but some of those phases just make me think of a nature documentary haha.\n\n\"The males of the species are constantly seeking copulation while females have learned to exercise more caution both from perceived risk of physical harm and social ramifications. Many males will reduce their chances of attracting a mate by overcompensating 'macho aggression' and unintentionally revealing predatory intentions to prospective mates\"", "He's told you, it's up to you whether you take this seriously and not fall for sunk cost fallacy. NTA", "Of course he is sexist, that's just stating the obvious.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nHe just showed you what he thinks of women, including you. You should believe him and act accordingly.", "NTA. What a double standard.", "Nta, your boyfriend sucks. He is sexist. Also you guys are young. You're not going to stay with him in the long run so why continue wasting your time? Move on.", "In this sort of instance, it can be entertaining to play completely dumb. Ask him to explain exactly why it's different for men and women to hook up. Request clarification. Dudes like this sometimes need to hear how dumb their own words sound.\n\nJust for funsies - That isn't advice on keeping the relationship,. I think he has some growing up to do.  NTA.", "His logic doesn't even make sense. The dudes who are literally waiting around, trying,  practically begging for sex from any woman who will give it to them aren't \"easy,\" but the women who get to pick and choose their partners are? \n\nNTA.", "YTA \n\nHe\u2019s not wrong, for a girl to have a ONS she just requires a pulse.

You setting her up was being a wing woman. \n But you could have grabbed a stranger off the street & 9 outta 10 will bang her. \n\n Women are technically the gatekeepers of sex, it is their vagina. So responsibility is like 99% on them. \n\n  \u201cLiving her best life\u201d is how I refer to my ex who can\u2019t keep a BF or husband\u201d \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "For sure. This dude is literally holding men and women to different standards. There's definitely some truth to guys being easier, especially the ones he hangs out with apparently. I can give a very slight pass on thinking that way if that's all he's known at 22 or 23, but this should be a learning experience for him.\n\nAlso, guy here and my girlfriend had been with ~3x as many partners as I had. She got *really* good and it's awesome.\n\nNTA", "This is so true, I am someone who is saving myself until marriage and there is still hate that comes my way - women can't win no matter what they do.", "Exactly, there is a difference between ignorance and sexism/racism/ableism, etc.\n\nBeing brought up in a society where this was normalized, and having been conditioned to think this way is an excuse to claim ignorance. Once someone has explained to you with valid reasoning as to why this is harmful and/or wrong, now it changes. You can either:\n\nTake time to analyze and think think and you go \"hm... yeah, I can see where I might have fucked up on this one\" - good job\n\nOr you can double down without being able to provide any sound reasons as to why it's not sexist - then you have left ignorance and entered sexist.", "My ex-roommate started out very much in incel territory, holding men and women to different standards just like in the post. His view was basically that dicks were master keys and vaginas were master locks. So a \"key\" that could open up several \"locks\" was valuable... but a \"lock\" that could be opened by many keys was trash. Thankfully I helped changed his mind on things over the years we lived together and drastically reduced the misogyny he carried. It's not fully gone away but he's much better than he used to be.", "Not to get all reddity but this type of behavior and belief system is absolutely fair game when it comes to re-evaluating a relationship.", "As women, we need to be accountable for the behaviour we accept in our partners and friends. \n\nIf you keep dating a guy who views women this way, you\u2019re condoning the behaviour. \n\nHe\u2019s too young to have these views. There\u2019s plenty of info out there and things have progressed a lot. His views are a choice he\u2019s made. His views are problematic and reflective of work that still needs to be done in society. Staying with someone like that makes you a part of the problem. \n\nBreak up and tell him why.
