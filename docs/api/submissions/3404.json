Just because they say \u201cyes\u201d to a hook up, does not make them more responsible, thus easy, since  they made the decision to take someone up on the offer that was extended to them first.

His views are sexist. So long as Claire makes sure she is protected, nothing wrong with casual consensual sex.", "NTA. When someone shows you who they really are, believe them.", "NTA\n\nI understand where the general idea comes from. In the olden days it was the woman who tended to take on that responsibility out of self-preservation because men could just deny they had sex with them and would generally be believed. And the woman had no choice but to have the baby, her life likely being ruined in the process.\n\nNowadays it should be seen exactly opposite though. Men should be gatekeeping sex. Once they do the deed they have no control over what happens after that (and rightly so.) No running from a paternity test or child support.\n\nI will say that at 22-23 I also probably had some not great viewpoints. Having bad views shouldn't be a dealbreaker, but being unwilling to listen or unable to understand why they are bad if explained is something else.
