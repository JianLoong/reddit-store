For women though, it is easy, because men are so often easy, again, by default. Women who choose to sleep with lots of men are considered easy because they make it easy for men to find a female partner for sex. Those women are more like men. It isnt sexist.

With each successive sexual \r  \nencounter with a person, that individual becomes a stronger learned signal for oxytocin \r  \nrelease, which in turn facilitates bonding (Witt, Carter, Lederhendler, & Kirkpatrick, 1997). \r  \nWomen intending to hook up might find themselves bonding \r  \nwith their partners instead. Counselors in university health \r  \ncenters are well aware that women often seek counseling fol\u0002lowing a hookup but men typically do not (Grossman, 2007)", "I dont feel like pulling up my psych textbook right now but I am 100% sure that it cited a study about college students. In that study, far more women reported feeling bad about themselves and seeking counseling after having casual sex. Many of them sought counseling solely because they were troubled over the fact that it was a one night stand (didnt become a relationship). Male college students on the other hand, rarely reported feeling this way or seeking counseling after having one night stands.

IT DOES NOT HELP ANYONE!! he literally told me something was wrong with me and said shit like i must not love him. oh and when things dry out down there a bit when your period finishes\u2026 i wasn\u2019t getting wet enough so i must not be attracted to him. Jesus can we get some sex ed please?", "[removed]", "Thank you for educating your friends. It is always far safer (and tends to get through to men much more often) when men approach other men about this topic than when women do.\n\nYou would think it should be pretty obvious to incels that if no woman is having sex with them, they need to look at themselves as the problem. But no, apparently it's much easier to perform the olympics of mental gymnastics, find a community of other incels, and hype each other up and adopt the viewpoints that women should be governmentally sanctioned to have sex with them.", "I mean, men have no problem making a rounding erorr when their response to being told they are not satisfying a woman is \"wHaT? I satisfy 99% of the women I've slept with. mUsT bE yOu\"", "Yes, if you are looking for a one night stand you are likely not going to care about satisfying your female partner.\n\nHowever, very often someone ends up in a committed relationship with someone who does not make them orgasm (a lot of times the women has never had an orgasm and doesn't know better). However if a woman knows she isn't achieving an orgasm and tells said boyfriend or husband - MANY times the male partner blames the woman, saying that he is able to satisfy 99% of his partners and then makes no effort to learn how to actually give women orgasms. \n\nSo yes and no. It is still very prevalent among non-hookups.", "I use \"Sir\" on two occasions.\n\n1. I am saying something that should be blatantly obvious either because it should literally just be obvious or because the person I am talking to made a really really stupid/sexist/discriminatory/etc comment. I find this makes it funnier because sir is traditionally used with respect, and I am using it ironically to someone who does not deserve respect in that moment.  \n\n2. I am talking to someone I don't know. Like \"Sir, you dropped this.\"\n\nMy use in this case regarding one night stands was perfect because it fits both", "Felt this to my core.", "Your experience is not universal.", "Puhhh-leaaaase, I'll have you know that I get rejected alllll the time \ud83d\ude0c", "Women are shamed for being promiscuous because guys like this think sex is something women give and they receive, not a mutually enjoyable experience for both parties. Women are 'easy' or 'give it up' too soon because you don't think of them as humans with their own desires, merely prizes to be one by a man. And the best prizes are those which were challenging to get. Nevermind what she might get out of the exchange, shes just a prop.", "You think it\u2019s easy for women to have sex? Why is that? Because all we have to do is lay there and position ourselves wide open? \n\nIf that\u2019s the case, that\u2019s an absolutely incorrect assumption.  If that\u2019s your experience, then I\u2019m not sure what to say to that except your both missing out on so much.  \n\nI\u2019m not saying men don\u2019t have it hard when it comes to having sex. It can be very Labor demanding, but if women are active partners they\u2019re doing a lot of physical work too. And even if it\u2019s plain old missionary style, women do not get off by a simple two seconds of foreplay and a one minute jackhammer performance. It is easier for a man to get off than it is a woman. We need more stimulation and that takes time. We wish we could get off quicker but it is what it is, and when our partners don\u2019t put the effort in to help us along, we\u2019re suffering from not being able to get off and left sexually unsatisfied. \n\nAnd women don\u2019t always get sex offers. There\u2019s a whole lot of women out there that don\u2019t fit into the whole \u201cbeautiful\u201d or \u201csexy\u201d or \u201cfuckable\u201d category and so they don\u2019t have anyone trying to seduce them.", "Really? And here I thought it was evolution. Silly me I guess", "YES. That's the whole point. Why are there so many commenters who dont understand this??? Men are easy by default (generally speaking). Women have options, and can choose to be picky, or to go HAM and cheese and fuck everything. The ones who go HAM would be considered \"easy\" from the perspective of men, because often times it is NOT easy to find a female partner for sex. On the other hand, so many men are easy that it is easy for women to find a male partner for sex. Interestingly, a study found that female college students were many times more likely to experience negative emotions and seek counseling after having one-night stands, usually because they wanted it to be something more.", "So find a story that disproves my statement", "Rachel Bloom is one of the funniest people alive", "I feel u on that one. 100 men could tell me I\u2019m the most attractive, beautiful, gorgeous, closest thing to ethereal goddess they\u2019ve ever come in to contact with and it wouldn\u2019t mean shit compared to how a drunk girl would compliment me in a random bar bathroom", ">that every other woman he\u2019s been with always got off during penetration sex by itself.\n\nYeah fucking right \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "How did he get another date after he said something must be wrong with you and you must not love him?! \n\nI hope he has learned from you and isn't still thinking that way!", "Yeah, I was with a guy who got straight up angry that he couldn't/didn't give me an orgasm. I was upfront from the beginning, told him I was unlikely to come the first couple times until we got our groove going, but he was really insistent to keep on trying. At that point it was clearly more about his pride than my pleasure.\n\nI still didn't fake one. I might have if I was worried for my safety, but in this case, angry just meant pouty and short-answers for a little while. (He said he wasn't angry at me, just 'the situation'.
