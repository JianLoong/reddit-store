Kudos to you for replacing the brownies, but that doesn't negate that you ate an entire hecking pan of someone else's brownies in one day.\n\nWe live in a magical modern period of cell phones and texting. I suggest you both try using them to communicate, and just send a text first asking if you can eat something when it doesn't belong to you before you actually eat it. In the scheme of things this shouldn't be a huge deal, but you both need to sit down and either decide not to touch other's food at all unless offered first, or a system that you can use to ask before you just take it.", "ESH.

Or it a pattern and this was the straw that broke the camel's back?\n\nHow would you feel if she bought you a box of pizza rolls to replace your pizza? Yeah they're similar, kinda,  but not close to the real thing.  You should never have replaced them, you should have told her and apologized.", "YTA - Its on you to tell Caro *when* you want your giant replacement pizza. If you wanted right after you got home from work she'd have gotten it for you, if you wanted it tonight she'd have gotten it for you. You on the other hand ate AN ENTIRE POTLUCKS WORTH OF BROWNIES IN A SINGLE SITTING. I mean who pigs out like that? Totally gross. Then, when you realized your mistake you half-assed the fix, LIED TO HER, and let her completely embarrass herself. They probably think she is a liar/bad cook now. Yeah she was a bad roommate first, but you are 100% an asshole.", "ESH on the both eating food that aint yours. her a little more than you cause why would they think thats cool? Your assumptions are well... presumptuous that it was for you without her saying anything.   \nHer screaming at you is likely less about you eating the brownies and that mistake. But more about you lying about it and hiding it. If the brownies are good as you say she may well have been hyping them up for the potluck and excited about showing them to her peers. Then she shows up with..... basic ass ok ones.   \n\n\nThe lying and deliberately covering it up is what you are TA for.", "ESH. There's no way you saw those brownies and said \"Oh my god thanks Caro for remembering about the pizza\". You saw the brownies and thought it was a perfect opportunity to stoop to her level.", "NTA. This drives me insane. It's not okay to eat THAT MUCH of someone else's food without permission. It's double bad for them to lose their mind for the same thing they did to you. At least you made a serious effort to replace it immediately! It's brownies, not creme brulee or tiramisu. What I want to know is where's your f**king pizza???", "ESH a little bit more her than you. Eating your pizza was lame and she should have replaced it immediately. You made a mistake and tried to fix it but should have told her right off the bat. Don\u2019t think it was cool for her to scream at you.", "e.s,h but really YTA because you guys already agreed that she would pay you back in some way and then you went and did the exact same thing she did. You didn\u2019t like it when she ate your food without asking so you turned around and did the same thing ? Even if you thought they were for you, how hard is it to not eat things that aren\u2019t yours without making sure you\u2019re allowed to have some? And you ate the ENTIRE batch by yourself, which was meant to feed an entire potluck. And instead of owning up to the mistake, you poorly covered your tracks instead of just telling her. Why don\u2019t you guys agree from now on to only eat food you know is yours, since the both of you are incapable of actually sharing without causing a problem?", "YTA. These incidents aren\u2019t related. You polished off an entire pan (like maybe 2-3 would be fine but the whole pan??) then tried to hide it.", "Who eats an entire tin of brownies in one sitting? YTA", "ESH, but you more. \n\nCaro took a store-bought pizza, which she shouldn't have in the first place but at least it can be easily replaced. You took brownies she had cooked herself. Isn't it obvious she had made them with something special in mind? How is that a fair exchange? And you didn't even tell her, and even worse deceived her. \n\nMaybe the two of you can just not take each others things without asking first?", "YTA. You know what they say \u201cwhen you assume, you make an ass of you and me.\u201d \nTo YOU it was a sufficient replacement, but you discount the labor of making brownies. \nAlso with regards to the pizza, two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. So you\u2019re the asshole, but you\u2019ve apologized so hopefully y\u2019all can move on from this.\n\nEdit: I will add an ESH element cause I don\u2019t think the occasion warranted screaming and name calling. So you\u2019re roomate should have kept the sir temper in check as well.", "YTA. Ever heard the phrase, \"an eye for an eye leaves the world blind?\" Also, eating the pizza you were unable to eat is *not* the same thing as taking it upon yourself to eat someone's food they had freshly prepared, and have plans for.", "YTA even though you are both at fault.\n\nYou are the bigger a%# here because Caro did text you about the brownies. You not only did not read the message, you polished off an entire tray of brownies, like wtf!", "Yta\n\nIts rude to help yourself to an entire ANYTHING in the fridge when you have roommates. You got greedy and then tried to lie your way out of it by doing a bait and brownie switch. \n\n>she ate my pizza in the first place.\n\nYou sound 5.", "YTA. I can kind of see where you're going with the equivalence of the actions (although a group of people eating a pizza is not the same as one person polishing off an entire tray of brownies, were you high?) but the trying to cover it up bit is what makes you the AH. You should've confessed and apologised before she took the brownies to the pot luck. I doubt her recipe for brownies is the same as a store bought brownie mix. Imagine how shameful that would be if she's been bigging up her brownies and then she unwraps some store-bought rubbish.", "hmmm hard to say. i\u2019m gonna say ESH or NAH \nshe ate your pizza without asking and hasn\u2019t made it up to you so you ate her brownies, an eye for an eye as they say. the pizza obviously wasn\u2019t for a pot luck but it still wasn\u2019t here\u2019s and of course you didn\u2019t know the brownies were for a potluck but i guess if you fessed up straight away the situation could have been better", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
