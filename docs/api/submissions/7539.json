There is a very very large difference between \"working too hard to cook\" and actually believing you are somehow entitled to home cooked meals from someone else because you work hard and dont want to cook.\n\nI usually dont like assuming but there is absolutely no way you're the type to pick up slack elsewhere, I'd almost guarantee that because you're the \"breadwinner\", you expect her to basically do 100% of chores even though she works part time.\n\nYTA", "YTA.

But I hope this woman leaves you. Jesus.", "Info what is HCOL? \n\nYou'd leave after sex to run home to mommy exactly one time before I told you not to come back. That's so ridiculous. You don't need a gf until you detach from your mother.\n\nYTA", "Not just an AH, but an arrogant AH.", "Yta grow up, working and cooking is part of being an adult. Your gf is right that's definitely an intimacy killer", "YTA. You're not sharing household chores based on working hours because you're not a household.", "YTA. But you go right on being one if it suits you. Your GF is letting you know that if you don't change the way you handle things, pronto, there will be no more sex for you. If that's a price you're willing to pay to get your lunches packed by Mommy, you go right ahead.", "YTA\n\nIf you prefer being a pampered little mommy's boy more than you enjoy being an adult in an adult relationship, then go do that instead of wasting this poor woman's time.", "How old are you?\nJust eew. \nWeren\u2019t you weaned?", "You didn\u2019t work so hard in life to not cook your own meals? What about parentless, single people who have worked way harder than you have? YTA\n\nOh there are so many people that exceed your wealth and hard work that choose to cook regardless of gender because they love and enjoy cooking and because, they\u2019re adults.\n\nAlso how old are you? Leaving after sex with your gf bc your mummy cooks and packs your lunch I\u2019m gonna be honest, it doesn\u2019t look good. Your girlfriend who made early investments that where successful that she can afford a mortgage more than yours and only work part time really needs a lot better ngl\u2026", "YTA\nIf you don\u2019t even live together then why would she cook everything for you. Did you know that if you say someone is making half of your salary it isn\u2019t necessary to say you get paid twice the amount she does. I know, you just said that. Obviously money is very important to you and that\u2019s fine. But you need to have a talk to make sure you understand each other better. \n\nThere are millions of people getting paid next to nothing for their technical skills and what not. They have put in work experience to get there usually. Not counting the usual legacy kid. \n\nIt sounds to me that she works as much as she does. The fact that you make more money doesn\u2019t make you entitled to all of that. I bet she\u2019s tired when she gets home from work too. I know I do. Most people do. Which is why we must fight back against the companies that expect you to work 100 hours a week but it doesn\u2019t change when you earn a salary like I do. \n\nTo me you sound like a self entitled brat. You really do not seem to care for her. If you want to save the relationship then apologize and start doing your part. Or break up and find a woman who will serve your every little whim. \n\nIf you hired someone to do some of the work she does and spoke to them like that, they would likely quit. \n\nTreat her with respect. Right now you\u2019re treating her like she\u2019s just half of a person.", "YTA. Just because you work full time doesn\u2019t mean you should have to ever cook meals. How about try communicating this with her instead of running off to mommy\u2019s? That would kill the intimacy for me too. You guys don\u2019t even live together. You\u2019re not even married. Tell her you miss her cooking. Stay the night. Cook for her. Cook together.", "Reads to me like YTA. You're not living with your partner but you expect her to cook for you every night. When was the last time you cooked for her and showed her a little appreciation as a person?\nI agree with your partner - someone running back to mommy after sex would be a hell of a problem for me, and leave me feeling like that person is just using me for sex but has no real interest in maintaining a proper relationship. No wonder she doesn't want to cook for you", "YTA. Stop letting your mom  cook you breakfast and pack your lunch. By now her job raising you should be done. Let her retire.\n\nAnd your gf is right to stop cooking dinner because she realizes you are only staying for your own benefit. Seems like she feels the relationship has become transactional on your side.", "Info, just because I\u2019m nosy. Do you do your own laundry?", "YTA - If what you are suggesting is that she has to cook for you. Particularly if that belief is based on your difference in income or gender.  \nDoes she even like to cook?   \n\n\nCooking is a domestic chore.  Couples usually sort this out when they live together (which you apparently don't do) when they divide up domestic chores in some equitable manner.  \n\n\nSo are you trying to punish her for not suiting your domestic ideal by not sleeping over?  Or is it because it's so convenient to be fed over at Mom's house?  \n\n\nIf you plan to live together this is something you both need to sit down and figure out.  \n\n\nAlso, you have sex with her and then head home to your Mom's because she cooks breakfast for you and packs you a lunch?  Oh no.   That's not cool.     \n\n\nYou're trying to take advantage of two women here.    \nYour Mom because she loves you I imagine.  (And BTW do you contribute to your Mom financially for this food she's feeding you all the time?  I had a neighbor who went thru this with her \"kid\" of 35 - and she couldn't afford the sandwiches she was making for his lunch.  It sure was nice for him though.).  \nAnd now you're trying to make your partner into someone she isn't because it would suit you better? What would be wrong with you ordering breakfast food and cooking it the next morning for both of you?  What a treat for her that would be!   \n\n\nOr better yet - how about you both cook some meals together?  My partner and I love to do this.", "that doesnt sound like a gf that sounds like a booty call", "YTA You are missing the actual issue here. Your girlfriend is frustrated because she feels used for sex and cooking because you run home to Mommy once you are finished with her. It\u2019s a really degrading feeling. You are thinking of this situation from only a logical (to you) standpoint and not from an empathetic one. There is more to life and relationships than logic.", "YTA. It\u2019s not the 1950s anymore bud.", "YTA. Just wow. I can't believe you even had to ask this. It's pretty freaking obvious.", "YTA grow up", "YTA lol you were condescending as shit.

Time to put on your big boy pants", "YTA \u2014 how are you the \u201cbreadwinner\u201d when she has a job and has her own home? You paying for meals and treats doesn\u2019t make you the breadwinner. Nor does it entitle you to tell her what to do. She owns her own home and can clearly sustain a life for herself without you. Doing something nice for her, like paying for stuff shouldn\u2019t equate as some form of debt toward you. Maybe she should start charging you for sex! Also, even if someone is fully reliant on you financially, doesn\u2019t mean you can treat them like garbage. I hope you\u2019re nice to your mom, because you sound like a spoiled, entitled a-hole who thinks that money gives you the right to treat people like a slave. Get over yourself.", "YTA - This is a joke right? The work you did 5+ years ago has no bearing on whether you make dinner tonight.  Go back to your mom\u2019s.", "YTA. You\u2019re not going to be the breadwinner of anything when you\u2019re single and alone getting mommy to still take care of you. People who work 80 hour weeks manage to cook and do their own laundry and there\u2019s 0 excuse for you not to do it yourself and it\u2019s a HUGE intimacy killer thinking about how your so called adult partner runs home to mommy\u2019s after sex because she makes your breakfast and lunch. And you do not make double her salary if you are working twice as much as her, that\u2019s simply called more hours = more money. It is not anyone\u2019s job but your own to manage your own household and take care of yourself and until you realize that your relationships aren\u2019t going to go anywhere because no one is going to marry you so they can start acting like your mommy dearest and doing basic responsibilities for you.", "Oh, huge YTA, one of the biggest I've seen here.  Seriously, did you time-travel from the 40's or 50's?  Wake up & smell the coffee...oh, wait, you're girlfriend isn't making you any coffee because she's tired of playing June Cleaver!  And your mommy isn't gonna always be there to cook for you, so you'd better start learning to cook for yourself.", "YTA.\n\nThis is like saying I've worked too hard to have to wipe my own ass.", "YTA. Youre using your girlfriend for sex and then heading home because you will get a packed breakfast and lunch. \n\nNothing wrong with being the breadwinner, but whats the point of all the bread if youre going to end up eating it alone?", "YTA also you are far too attached to your mother, it\u2019s affecting your relationships so you should deal with that", "YTA, in no world does breadwinner mean not having to cook. Whoever raised you did a terrible job.", "YTA. you work too hard to take care of yourself? hire a personal chef if you really think that way", "YTA. Time to cut the fucking umbilical cord, you sexist asshole.  Learn to take care of yourself- your girlfriend is not your mommy.", "YTA, massively and I\u2019d bet that you\u2019re close to being a single AH. You have a skewed idea of what a relationship should be and need to catch up on learning life skills like cooking, laundry and cleaning that you missed out on while you were learning from books. If you want any chance of a LTR with any partner, you\u2019ll need to make changes. If not, you\u2019ll still be mommy\u2019s best little man. /s", "YTA - Pay someone to cook your meals if you don\u2019t want to do it yourself. Your gf didn\u2019t sign up for this.", "YTA.

She is not your caiter waiter YTA", "YTA. \n\nSomeone else isn't cooking your meals because you worked hard. That would mean you are paying for someone to cook your meals because you worked hard and can afford that. Not your mom still making dino nuggies for her adult son. The girlfriend deserves so much better. Like someone who wants to cook with/for her.", "YTA. It\u2019s one thing to not want to cook because you don\u2019t enjoy it or you\u2019re simply not good at it. But you think cooking is beneath you. That says something about the way you view your \u201cpartner.\u201d", "YTA - having sex with someone who always leaves afterwards is dehumanising and demoralising. It severely curtails any intimacy beyond the physical. Having your partner value you based on what you can do for them, and leave when you no longer have use for them is extremely hurtful and the whole \u2018Mummy\u2019 element makes this very \u2018ick\u2019.

Yta. Seriously you treat her like she is an inconvenience. Get what you want and leave... And she just has to deal. Cos cooking is so terrible. YTA.", "Yta you don't live with her or pay her mortgage. You think you're the breadwinner because you pay for dinner sometimes?

You are so deep in the patriarchy and mysoginy it's scary. Its not the 1950's. A woman's place isn't in the kitchen nor is it the place to pander lazy assed men who are stuck in the past.

Grow up.", "You just ooze alpha male toxicity, dontcha? Everything about your post just negates your GF's worth unless it has value in service to YOU.

You should come with a warning label. YTA", " YTA. So you\u2019re not married, you don\u2019t live with her, you don\u2019t provide for her and you expect her to cook for you?

The comments here have already covered most of what makes you the asshole. There are so many options to have someone prepare your meals for you these days that you yearning for some 1950s dream is ridiculous. If you make enough money and for some reason cooking for yourself seems like a nightmare scenario then use some of that wealth to make a compromise. Sick of eating out? Bring the food home with you. Have prepared meals delivered to you for easy preparation. Especially if you live in an area that is HCOL you'll have options. You're self sabotaging because you refuse to compromise and grow up. But in a way that is a good ending because it allows her to run since you don't seem to want to change. She is living her life and it seems you are incompatible to say the least.", "Yta grow up seriously why are u getting your mum to make your food u r probably living rent free get a life", "OP you yes, YOU are TA.\n\nIt isn't her job to cook for you because you work more. So what? You both bring things to a relationship, apparently all you want from her is being roll in the hay, thanks for the fun and, going to my mom's now so mom can cook for you since she doesn't want to be a Stepford wife for you. Have you asked her what she wants from the relationship or you just stating what you want and expect her to jump and embrace your idea that died in the 60s?\n\nI hope she runs away and finds a PARTNER, vs someone who wants a screw toy and doormat.\n\nYou are a human participation trophy. Congrats", "Yes, YTA, and also, ewww.\n\nAre you a responsible adult or a baby? Because no actual responsible adult runs to Mommy to get food and breakfast. I mean... come one. The only reason I personally eat my mother's food daily is because WE LIVE TOGETHER.\n\nI mean, COME. ON. We're all tired. We all have lives.

Both of you deserve to be with someone who loves you for who you are, instead of trying to change each other.", "You work a laid back 40 hours a week, but you can't cook or clean yourself?\n\nDid you miss out on the shame chromosome?", "The crazy thing is how much money they make isn\u2019t relevant. At all. He\u2019s just so insecure he had to make sure we all know he makes more money than his gf.\n\nThis guy is such a walking meme that it seems likely this is bait.", "You\u2019re right, and OP\u2019s post reads even worse now you\u2019ve said that! Do you think his mommy washes his big boy pants as well or does he do his own laundry? Taking bets now.", "And with a better social life.", "I think he never moved out. \u201cHead home to my mom\u2019s\u201d", "I thought bang maid was pretty low. This guy wants a bang mommy.", "Doesn\u2019t mean you need to run home to your mummy for dinner and a packed lunch after having sex with your girlfriend. It\u2019s funny because you have time for that\u2026", "You don\u2019t feed yourself, and you don\u2019t do your own laundry.\n\nIf you are so tired from your sales job that you can\u2019t feed or clothe yourself, I suggest you get medical attention to see why your testicles haven\u2019t descended.", "*sigh* Of course you don't.", "You're a whole adult and you don't do your own cooking *or* laundry? How have you survived this long on your own? YTA", "Does mommy do it?", "What does not at the moment mean? Have you ever consistently done your laundry?", "Lmao. I can\u2019t. Wtf", "Of course you don\u2019t lmfaooo\n\nGood troll dude. This sounds like incel porn.", "I imagine she cuts the crusts off his bread for him. Her big boy has worked too hard to have to eat crusts!", "I just don't like cooking. I've always had my Mom cook for me.\n\nI want my GF to cook more for me and have me at her house. Right now I only see her when I treat or when I catch her at the gym.", "Exactly.  I could see a NTA where he pays for meals out and she reciprocates by home cooking *if* they both agreed to that arrangement. But this is clear YTA territory.\n\nThe man wants a bang maid. Or more disturbingly, a bang-mommy.", "Yeah exactly. \n\nThis was a real eye roll of a post. And if by chance this is real and not bait, OP is an eye roll in human form and I hope his gf sees sense and leaves his entitled ass.", "They don't even live together! The issue isn't 'she works PT and pays fewer bills, and should therefore cook more often' - a reasonable AITA.\n\nThe issue also isn't 'I earn a lot and therefore don't mind paying to eat out instead of having to cook and my gf says that's not very healthy of me' - another reasonable AITA. There is no financial issue here at all.\n\nIt's literally \"AITA because if my gf won't make my breakfast and lunch I go to my mommy and get her to do it for me\".", "I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t tell us how much he made. Gotta flex on the poors you know.", "Yeah, it\u2019s not even in the vicinity of relevant!", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Let\u2019s be real, he doesn\u2019t know how to operate a washing machine. Or probably how to handle a mop and bucket for that matter.", "Yeah, she's probably distancing herself from you because she knows that any future with you would be a disaster, with you expecting her to wipe your ass. With your mummy cooking you breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and doing your laundry, and probably cleaning for you, you are not an attractive long term partner", "I don't like cleaning, but I do it anyway because it needs to be done and I don't expect others to clean up after me. Cooking is a basic life skill.", "You still live with your mom and still need her to feed and clothe you (laundry). \n\nYour girlfriend probably stopped cooking once she realized she\u2019d be just a replacement mother. Looks like you would only be willing to stay at her house if she cooked meals and does your laundry.", "Do you think it\u2019s fair on you mom who raised, cleaned, and fed you, to continue doing this into adulthood when you\u2019re perfectly capable of doing things yourself?\n\nI don\u2019t know your mom\u2019s thought process, she may genuinely enjoy treating you like a toddler or she just doesn\u2019t know how to tell you to gtfo and let her enjoy her own damn life without having to pack your lunches and whatever else toddlers can\u2019t do.", "Dude, adults do shit they don\u2019t want to do all of the time because it\u2019s necessary. You are a grown man that apparently can\u2019t feed himself. That\u2019s pathetic that you have to rely on the women in your life in order to survive. Grow up, do your own laundry, learn to cook your own damn food, and stop treating your girlfriend like a one night stand.", "So what would be in it for your gf to have you over at her place more? I am sure it would be great for you to have the person you're having sex with also cook and clean for you, but there have to be positive sides for the other person too. You say that your gf is out networking, meeting people, going to the gym, and being an independent person. You want her to change some of this in favor of what? What can you bring to the table when you're not out paying for dinner? Would you also be willing to have her over at your place and treat her to dinner there?\n\nYou know that staying at someone else's place is creating more work for the person there, no?\n\nRight now it looks to me as if your gf is not really seeing you as a proper partner, it's nice to go out with you every now and then, but she's seeing that you're not someone to count on long-term. Think about what you can bring to the table, having a nice income is not the answer to all things. It's how you treat people, interact with them, value them as a person.", "I get having your parents cook for you sometimes but you gotta do it yourself sometimes/at some point too.  It's kind of pathetic if someone can't or doesn't ever cook for themselves...", "Yeah exactly. With a bunch of chauvinism piled on top.", "No matter what he makes, he\u2019s likely insecure about it.\n\nActing like he\u2019s in Mad Men while crawling back to mommy for feeding time. Such a tool."]}
