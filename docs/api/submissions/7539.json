There is a very very large difference between \"working too hard to cook\" and actually believing you are somehow entitled to home cooked meals from someone else because you work hard and dont want to cook.\n\nI usually dont like assuming but there is absolutely no way you're the type to pick up slack elsewhere, I'd almost guarantee that because you're the \"breadwinner\", you expect her to basically do 100% of chores even though she works part time.\n\nYTA", "YTA.

But I hope this woman leaves you. Jesus.", "Info what is HCOL? \n\nYou'd leave after sex to run home to mommy exactly one time before I told you not to come back. That's so ridiculous. You don't need a gf until you detach from your mother.\n\nYTA", "Not just an AH, but an arrogant AH.", "Yta grow up, working and cooking is part of being an adult. Your gf is right that's definitely an intimacy killer", "YTA. You're not sharing household chores based on working hours because you're not a household.", "YTA. But you go right on being one if it suits you. Your GF is letting you know that if you don't change the way you handle things, pronto, there will be no more sex for you. If that's a price you're willing to pay to get your lunches packed by Mommy, you go right ahead.", "YTA\n\nIf you prefer being a pampered little mommy's boy more than you enjoy being an adult in an adult relationship, then go do that instead of wasting this poor woman's time.", "How old are you?\nJust eew. \nWeren\u2019t you weaned?", "You didn\u2019t work so hard in life to not cook your own meals? What about parentless, single people who have worked way harder than you have? YTA\n\nOh there are so many people that exceed your wealth and hard work that choose to cook regardless of gender because they love and enjoy cooking and because, they\u2019re adults.\n\nAlso how old are you? Leaving after sex with your gf bc your mummy cooks and packs your lunch I\u2019m gonna be honest, it doesn\u2019t look good. Your girlfriend who made early investments that where successful that she can afford a mortgage more than yours and only work part time really needs a lot better ngl\u2026", "YTA\nIf you don\u2019t even live together then why would she cook everything for you. Did you know that if you say someone is making half of your salary it isn\u2019t necessary to say you get paid twice the amount she does. I know, you just said that. Obviously money is very important to you and that\u2019s fine. But you need to have a talk to make sure you understand each other better. \n\nThere are millions of people getting paid next to nothing for their technical skills and what not. They have put in work experience to get there usually. Not counting the usual legacy kid. \n\nIt sounds to me that she works as much as she does. The fact that you make more money doesn\u2019t make you entitled to all of that. I bet she\u2019s tired when she gets home from work too. I know I do. Most people do. Which is why we must fight back against the companies that expect you to work 100 hours a week but it doesn\u2019t change when you earn a salary like I do. \n\nTo me you sound like a self entitled brat. You really do not seem to care for her. If you want to save the relationship then apologize and start doing your part. Or break up and find a woman who will serve your every little whim. \n\nIf you hired someone to do some of the work she does and spoke to them like that, they would likely quit. \n\nTreat her with respect. Right now you\u2019re treating her like she\u2019s just half of a person.", "YTA. Just because you work full time doesn\u2019t mean you should have to ever cook meals. How about try communicating this with her instead of running off to mommy\u2019s? That would kill the intimacy for me too. You guys don\u2019t even live together. You\u2019re not even married. Tell her you miss her cooking. Stay the night. Cook for her. Cook together.", "Reads to me like YTA. You're not living with your partner but you expect her to cook for you every night. When was the last time you cooked for her and showed her a little appreciation as a person?\nI agree with your partner - someone running back to mommy after sex would be a hell of a problem for me, and leave me feeling like that person is just using me for sex but has no real interest in maintaining a proper relationship. No wonder she doesn't want to cook for you", "YTA. Stop letting your mom  cook you breakfast and pack your lunch. By now her job raising you should be done. Let her retire.\n\nAnd your gf is right to stop cooking dinner because she realizes you are only staying for your own benefit. Seems like she feels the relationship has become transactional on your side.", "Info, just because I\u2019m nosy. Do you do your own laundry?", "YTA - If what you are suggesting is that she has to cook for you. Particularly if that belief is based on your difference in income or gender.  \nDoes she even like to cook?   \n\n\nCooking is a domestic chore.  Couples usually sort this out when they live together (which you apparently don't do) when they divide up domestic chores in some equitable manner.  \n\n\nSo are you trying to punish her for not suiting your domestic ideal by not sleeping over?  Or is it because it's so convenient to be fed over at Mom's house?  \n\n\nIf you plan to live together this is something you both need to sit down and figure out.  \n\n\nAlso, you have sex with her and then head home to your Mom's because she cooks breakfast for you and packs you a lunch?  Oh no.   That's not cool.     \n\n\nYou're trying to take advantage of two women here.    \nYour Mom because she loves you I imagine.  (And BTW do you contribute to your Mom financially for this food she's feeding you all the time?  I had a neighbor who went thru this with her \"kid\" of 35 - and she couldn't afford the sandwiches she was making for his lunch.  It sure was nice for him though.).  \nAnd now you're trying to make your partner into someone she isn't because it would suit you better? What would be wrong with you ordering breakfast food and cooking it the next morning for both of you?  What a treat for her that would be!   \n\n\nOr better yet - how about you both cook some meals together?  My partner and I love to do this.", "that doesnt sound like a gf that sounds like a booty call", "YTA You are missing the actual issue here. Your girlfriend is frustrated because she feels used for sex and cooking because you run home to Mommy once you are finished with her. It\u2019s a really degrading feeling. You are thinking of this situation from only a logical (to you) standpoint and not from an empathetic one. There is more to life and relationships than logic.", "YTA. It\u2019s not the 1950s anymore bud.", "YTA. Just wow. I can't believe you even had to ask this. It's pretty freaking obvious.", "YTA grow up", "YTA lol you were condescending as shit.

Time to put on your big boy pants", "YTA \u2014 how are you the \u201cbreadwinner\u201d when she has a job and has her own home? You paying for meals and treats doesn\u2019t make you the breadwinner. Nor does it entitle you to tell her what to do. She owns her own home and can clearly sustain a life for herself without you. Doing something nice for her, like paying for stuff shouldn\u2019t equate as some form of debt toward you. Maybe she should start charging you for sex! Also, even if someone is fully reliant on you financially, doesn\u2019t mean you can treat them like garbage. I hope you\u2019re nice to your mom, because you sound like a spoiled, entitled a-hole who thinks that money gives you the right to treat people like a slave. Get over yourself.", "YTA - This is a joke right? The work you did 5+ years ago has no bearing on whether you make dinner tonight.  Go back to your mom\u2019s.", "YTA. You\u2019re not going to be the breadwinner of anything when you\u2019re single and alone getting mommy to still take care of you. People who work 80 hour weeks manage to cook and do their own laundry and there\u2019s 0 excuse for you not to do it yourself and it\u2019s a HUGE intimacy killer thinking about how your so called adult partner runs home to mommy\u2019s after sex because she makes your breakfast and lunch. And you do not make double her salary if you are working twice as much as her, that\u2019s simply called more hours = more money. It is not anyone\u2019s job but your own to manage your own household and take care of yourself and until you realize that your relationships aren\u2019t going to go anywhere because no one is going to marry you so they can start acting like your mommy dearest and doing basic responsibilities for you.", "Oh, huge YTA, one of the biggest I've seen here.  Seriously, did you time-travel from the 40's or 50's?  Wake up & smell the coffee...oh, wait, you're girlfriend isn't making you any coffee because she's tired of playing June Cleaver!  And your mommy isn't gonna always be there to cook for you, so you'd better start learning to cook for yourself.", "YTA.\n\nThis is like saying I've worked too hard to have to wipe my own ass.", "YTA. Youre using your girlfriend for sex and then heading home because you will get a packed breakfast and lunch. \n\nNothing wrong with being the breadwinner, but whats the point of all the bread if youre going to end up eating it alone?", "YTA also you are far too attached to your mother, it\u2019s affecting your relationships so you should deal with that", "YTA, in no world does breadwinner mean not having to cook. Whoever raised you did a terrible job.", "YTA. you work too hard to take care of yourself? hire a personal chef if you really think that way", "YTA. Time to cut the fucking umbilical cord, you sexist asshole.  Learn to take care of yourself- your girlfriend is not your mommy.", "YTA, massively and I\u2019d bet that you\u2019re close to being a single AH. You have a skewed idea of what a relationship should be and need to catch up on learning life skills like cooking, laundry and cleaning that you missed out on while you were learning from books. If you want any chance of a LTR with any partner, you\u2019ll need to make changes. If not, you\u2019ll still be mommy\u2019s best little man. /s", "YTA - Pay someone to cook your meals if you don\u2019t want to do it yourself. Your gf didn\u2019t sign up for this.", "YTA.

She is not your caiter waiter YTA", "YTA. \n\nSomeone else isn't cooking your meals because you worked hard. That would mean you are paying for someone to cook your meals because you worked hard and can afford that. Not your mom still making dino nuggies for her adult son. The girlfriend deserves so much better. Like someone who wants to cook with/for her.", "YTA. It\u2019s one thing to not want to cook because you don\u2019t enjoy it or you\u2019re simply not good at it. But you think cooking is beneath you. That says something about the way you view your \u201cpartner.\u201d", "YTA - having sex with someone who always leaves afterwards is dehumanising and demoralising. It severely curtails any intimacy beyond the physical. Having your partner value you based on what you can do for them, and leave when you no longer have use for them is extremely hurtful and the whole \u2018Mummy\u2019 element makes this very \u2018ick\u2019.

Yta. Seriously you treat her like she is an inconvenience. Get what you want and leave... And she just has to deal. Cos cooking is so terrible. YTA.", "Yta you don't live with her or pay her mortgage. You think you're the breadwinner because you pay for dinner sometimes?

You are so deep in the patriarchy and mysoginy it's scary. Its not the 1950's. A woman's place isn't in the kitchen nor is it the place to pander lazy assed men who are stuck in the past.

Grow up.", "You just ooze alpha male toxicity, dontcha? Everything about your post just negates your GF's worth unless it has value in service to YOU.

You should come with a warning label. YTA", " YTA. So you\u2019re not married, you don\u2019t live with her, you don\u2019t provide for her and you expect her to cook for you?

The comments here have already covered most of what makes you the asshole. There are so many options to have someone prepare your meals for you these days but you yearning for some 1950s dream is ridiculous. If you make enough money and for some reason cooking for yourself seems like a nightmare scenario then use some of that wealth to make a compromise. Sick of eating out? Bring the food home with you. Have prepared meals delivered to you for easy preparation. Especially if you live in an area that is HCOL you'll have options. You're self sabotaging because you refuse to compromise and grow up. But in a way that is a good ending because it allows her to run since you don't seem to want to change. She is living her life and it seems you are incompatible to say the least.", "Yta grow up seriously why are u getting your mum to make your food u r probably living rent free get a life", "OP you yes, YOU are TA.\n\nIt isn't her job to cook for you because you work more. So what? You both bring things to a relationship, apparently all you want from her is being roll in the hay, thanks for the fun and, going to my mom's now so mom can cook for you since she doesn't want to be a Stepford wife for you. Have you asked her what she wants from the relationship or you just stating what you want and expect her to jump and embrace your idea that died in the 60s?\n\nI hope she runs away and finds a PARTNER, vs someone who wants a screw toy and doormat.\n\nYou are a human participation trophy. Congrats", "Yes, YTA, and also, ewww.\n\nAre you a responsible adult or a baby? Because no actual responsible adult runs to Mommy to get food and breakfast. I mean... come one. The only reason I personally eat my mother's food daily is because WE LIVE TOGETHER.\n\nI mean, COME. ON. We're all tired. We all have lives.

OP didnt mention cleaning as far as I've seen but her cooking for him clearly makes him feel cared for and he isnt feeling cared for because of their lifestyles which is the clear issue here.

What does his gf bring to the relationship?  Her hot ass?  Wheres the equality in this case?  \n\nYou work less hours than your wife you should do more than half the housework.  Shes the breadwinner.  No \"in relationship\" chores are not shared automatically people come up with what works for them or they break up.  I'm supposed to think you're a great guy cuz you share half the chores but work less?  Congrats bro.  Good for you.  Here's your cookie for doing less than your wife in a relationship where you share everything equally.  So far you are contributing less to your relationship than op is.\n\nWhat's the gf bringing to the relationship?  She is providing sex, nothing else.  You ridicule and insult his mother by talking how you are.

If you're such a  successful man, prove it and take care of yourself instead of leeching off your poor mother as a nearly 30 year old man, or expecting another woman to do it instead. \n\nYou're an enormous AH.  And you sound like a sexist AH, at that.", "Aaah ok now it's clear. You've always been spoiled by Mommy and expect the same from your girlfriend. Instead of using her free time to serve you, she prefers to be out with friends. The audacity /s\n\nYTA. Grow up. Making good money doesn't exempt you from the responsibilities of an adult, unless you make enough to hire a cook and a cleaner.", "So you don't really want a GF, you want another mommy. \n\nYou don't cook,  you don't do laundry,  I'm sure you don't clean.  Not being self sufficient is an incredibly unattractive trait in an adult.  Hopefully for her sake your gf realizes soon that you're not the catch you seem to think you are. \n\nYTA", ">I want my GF to cook more for me and have me at her house.\n\nYou gonna ask her to start tying your shoes for you next?", "Did your parents not teach you to cook? Are you seriously nearly 30 and still have your mother cook for you?", "It sounds like your girlfriend doesn't like cooking either, so why should she cook for you? \n A lot of people don't like cooking but it's just something we have to do as adults. You only work 9-5 so you don't work too much to cook. \nI hope your not planning on having kids because it's a lot more work.\n My husband, 13 year old daughter and I have turns cooking dinner, our 11 year old cooks sometimes too.\n Our 13, 11 and even our 9 year old girls get up in the morning and make their own breakfast and lunches.", "Dude. Buy a simple ass cookbook. Do your laundry. No one likes doing these things but it's adulting. Grow up. YTA", "Why would she ever want you at her place when you just run home to mommy after sex? You see how creepy and gross this is?   \n\n\nYTA. Grow up and start acting your age.", "so you want a replacement mommy?", "Why does she have to cook for you? You don't live together, you don't pay her bills, you don't pay her mortgage, you don't do shit bro. I thought you at least work in Investment Banking with absolutely crazy hours but you work 9 to 5, like most people on earth. If you don't want to cook or do laundry in your mom's home, fine. But don't expect someone else that don't even live with you or get paid by you to cook for you like a servant.", "Yeah I was with him when he mentioned taking his girlfriend out to dinner, etc. And then it went downhill right after this sentence.", "Yeah...it's absolutely reasonable for the person with more free time to do things that take time (speaking in generalities here and assuming free time truly free, not time not working due to something like chronic illness or whatever). It's also reasonable to want a partner who enjoys doing the chores you don't enjoy doing. I have executive dysfunction. I can't be in a seriously relationship with someone with my level/type of executive dysfunction. It's just two squirrels living in a sock at that point. If their weird compliments my weird? Golden. \n\nBut OP goes off the rails with \"I'm the breadwinner\" because...they aren't living together with combined incomes. There is no \"breadwinner.\" Then runs the train off a cliff when he leaves to go eat breakfast with his mom who also packs his lunch. It's clear he wants his girlfriend to do the same thing, which is what it is, but his girlfriend clearly has no desire to do it and is hurt by it, so yeah he's an asshole. An elitist asshole.", "And\u2026 doesn\u2019t that mean they\u2019re making about the same hourly rate? Seems weird to brag about.", "That\u2019s the craziest part!  He\u2019s the main bread winner for\u2026.. himself?\n\nHe\u2019s not paying any of his gf\u2019s expenses, unless you count \u201cdinner, coffee, and treats.\u201d And if paying for meals is what counts as being the bread winner, then it seems like his mom is actually the main bread winner.\n\nHe said in another comment he doesn\u2019t do his own laundry which makes me doubt he has his own place. And when he was talking about leaving after sex he said he would \u201chead **home** to my mom\u2019s.\u201d Like, what seems more likely: he goes to his mom\u2019s house whenever he\u2019s hungry or has dirty laundry, or he lives there? It\u2019s totally possible he has his own place, but he clearly doesn\u2019t live *on his own.*\n\nMaybe I should stop clowning on this dude but he said so much stupid entitled shit", "well hes on the same hourly rate as an uneducated, part-time, *woman*...\n\nso probably a very average rate, *despite his education, full-time status and testicles.*", "Maybe.  But when it\u2019s after sex on a week night it seems more like he lives there.", "So because he takes her out every so often she has to cook his meals and if she doesn't he f*cks and leaves. She maintains her own home and job he lives with his mum and his whole post is him putting her down your fine with your relationship dynamic thats great but not every woman wants to be a 1950s housewife specially when your also paying all the bills and he just shows up for sex", "I\u2019m a lesbian, no bros here. There are some spectacular assumptions about my life in your post based on the vague fact that I work fewer hours than my wife, so, here\u2019s more info. My wife only works about 3 hours more per week than I do and sometimes works fewer than I do, so it\u2019s pretty equally split hours-wise. We split the housework, laundry, cooking, etc. We pay for dates equally because we split finances, shock horror. What a *modern* idea. I earn a little less than she does but that\u2019s irrelevant because unlike OP, my wife and I don\u2019t subscribe to the idea that \u201cthe person who earns more does fewer jobs.\u201d If we see a job needing to be done, we do it, simple as that.\n\n>What does his gf bring to the relationship?\n\nNo idea, since OP spent the whole time talking about himself and condescendingly putting her down for being as successful as him with only half the effort.\n\nYou\u2019ve also missed that she\u2019s apparently chosen to only work part time because she doesn\u2019t need to work full-time thanks to her investments bringing in enough money. You know that if he was funding her mortgage he would\u2019ve said so, so focused on money OP is. She has a higher mortgage than him which she\u2019s managing to pay it on half the money that he earns. She\u2019s doing better than he is, he\u2019s clearly jealous, and he\u2019s being a baby about it.", "So what? She's not happy with it and just because he sometimes takes her out doesn't mean he's paying for everything because he isn't. Your happy with that she clearly isn't its fine to enjoy cooking for your partner its not fine to demand someone cook for you because they earn less. Relationships are about compromise and things working for both people which in time case it does in the ops girls friends side it doesn't she doesn't want to be his replacement mum just because he currently earns more", "The gf actually is lucky because she seems to realise how unwilling to be an adult OP is before she marries him.", "Haha fair. You aren\u2019t wrong.", "I'm talking about the mom, not the girlfriend. He says he heads \"home to my mom's\" which makes me think he lives with his mom. Does he live in her home rent-free? Does he pay a share, a fair one? Or does he pay everything ?", "But shes happy to take all the free dates with no offer to pay.  This is like women who go to the bar and score free drinks from men who are hoping to sleep with them then crying about how just because they took the drink doesnt mean they want to talk to him and now they cant shake him off.  Nothing is free in life and of you dont wanna pay for something you better not take the freebie.  Pretending the gf is perfectly innocent in all this and hes now the bad guy cuz he continued to pay for everything when just a month ago she WAS cooking for him is silly.", "\"I usually pay for everything\"\n\nShe is perfectly happy accepting his manly gender role of paying for dates.  It doesnt matter if she refuses to pay or not.  She doesnt insist on equality in the relationship so shes sexist.  She doesnt provide equality with other means so she is happy to let him do the heavy lifting and provides nothing in return.  She is happy with gender roles when it benefits her.\n\nHe doesnt get another woman to do it.  He goes home to a mother and maybe a father and a sibling who also eat breakfast there.  Let's not pretend his mom is there slaving away to make op happy because hes a man.\n\nWhy would he contribute to her mortgage and bills he doesnt live there.  Shes treating him like a booty call actually as well as a wallet when they go out.  The gf is worse.  He doesnt get anything from the relationship.  Providing him food is something his mother does and makes him feel cared for.  What does his gf do to make him feel cared for?  Hes a wallet and a booty call he leaves before he has to wake up and buy her breakfast.\n\nSo you think a stressful job isn't as intensive as a physical labour job?  You have no idea what his working conditions are like and it doesnt matter.  He provides more to the relationship and feels it's because of his financial status.  What does she provide?\n\nLol it's a nice gesture until it's you paying for almost everything and getting nothing in return except sex (which is mutually beneficial).  I cant imagine dating a man who paid for our dates and providing  nothing in return it would feel really crappy.  It's not a nice gesture when it's the only gesture always being made by the same person.", "But he's not telling her to make him breakfast. He's going elsewhere to get breakfast. Let's say he would leave to get breakfast at Starbucks, would you also call him TA?", "Ffs what a child \ud83d\ude02", "I think I would legit question it. \n\n\"You.. you are an adult... right???\"", "Ah it was meant to go to OP. Will repost.", "You're being a bit rough on toddlers there, my 4yo can pack her own snack for school.", "This whole post reads like it was written by Cartman from South Park.\n\nI have a mental image of OP sat in his mums basement playing Xbox and screaming at his mum to bring him nuggies and mountain dew.", "Yes. It must really sting him that after all his *hard work* he\u2019s on the same level as his gf who he condescendingly mentions never went past secondary education.", "That's assuming she works 20 and him 40. He could be clocking in some OT for that amount and she works 10 so yeah, in that case she would make more an hour and his ego is bruised.", "Oh my GODDD \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \nA child. That is a man- child using words he doesn't understand (e.g. breadwinner)", "Agree that is very odd", "She doesn't HAVE to do anything it's what he'd like her to do.  He pays for everything.  What's she providing?  He can have sex and leave all he wants her ass is the only thing shes providing.  Is he supposed to stay and make her breakfast too?  Sex is mutually beneficial it isnt something she is providing herself.\n\nRight and it doesn't make him an asshole if he wants that relationship dynamic (that was perfectly normal 20 years ago btw not 1950s).  It just means he might be with the wrong girl cuz his gf thinks she should be entitled to a man who is a provider and seems to give nothing in return.  Again, what is she providing in the relationship?  Hes actually not the lazy one in the relationship, she is.  You just view him negatively because he CAN still live at home.", "Congrats on your sexual identity.\n\nYou are the one who stated you work fewer hours now you want to specify it's only 3 ok whatever.  That's more than 30 minutes a day you have to get dinner started while shes still at work btw.\n\nRight but splitting finances is fine if that's the dynamic of your relationship that is not the dynamic in OPs relationship he pays for almost everything.  Ops gf is clearly happy to not live in the modern era when it benefits her.\n\nThat's nice your relationship works that way.  OP is paying for almost everything and his gf is happy to accept. \n\nOP actually mentioned his gf a lot as well as the fact that she used to cook but stopped.  Making their relationship dynamic one where he paid and she cooked.\n\nWhy would he pay for a mortgage in a place he doesnt live?  She literally has her own house why would he need to pay for that too.  He pays for almost everything in their relationship so if they dont live together and share chores what does she provide?  The answer is nothing", "They are in a relationship where he doesn't \"sometimes\" take her out he states he pays for most things and she WAS cooking but stopped a month ago meaning that was the dynamic of their relationship.\n\nShe doesn't have to enjoy cooking but it doesnt make him an asshole for wanting to be with a woman who does.  \n\nWheres her compromise all that happened was she stopped cooking and he still pays for almost everything.  Wheres he asking to be a replacement for his mother?  If she was paying for the majority of the dates and wanted him to cook would you say the same thing?  Obviously not.", "If he has an issue with how she\u2019s responding when he offers to pay for dates, maybe he should take to her about it?\n\nYoure right, why would he pay her mortgage and bills when he doesn\u2019t live there? Equally, why would she cook his meals and pack his lunch when he doesn\u2019t live there??\n\nAt no point has OP said that his gf EXPECTS him to pay for dates, nor does he pay all the time, only \u2018usually\u2019 and when \u2018he takes her out\u2019. When my bf takes me out he pays, when I take him out I pay. That\u2019s pretty normal.\n\nOP EXPECTS his girlfriend to invite him over more and cook him meals just because he works full time. We also don\u2019t know that she provides \u2018nothing\u2019 in return, only that she doesn\u2019t cook all of his meals like OP thinks he\u2019s entitled to because he makes more money and works full time. In fact, OP says she only stopped cooking for him \u2018a month ago\u2019 because he left straight after sex when she didn\u2019t. \n\nYou\u2019ve decided to assume she\u2019s a gold digger who offers nothing in return just because she doesn\u2019t cook for him as much as he\u2019d like.\n\nIn fact, she did used to cook for him sometimes but only stopped because the fact he\u2019d run home to mommy immediately after sex when she didn\u2019t cook for him was an intimacy killer.\n\nContinue to demonise her because her bf occasionally takes her out and usually pays when he does though, I\u2019m sure someone else will agree OP deserves home cooked meals every single day just because he occasionally makes a nice gesture.", "Alright!", "Lol my apologies, OP should take notes from her tbh.", "J\nHww\u0175w2wwqq2", "Would be pretty funny if that\u2019s the case.", "He doesn't provide for her though lol she pays all her own bills and mortgage he just occasionally takes her to a meal lol", "Yes he does.  He pays for most of their time together.  He literally is the provider in their relationship.  He doesnt live there why would he be paying her Bill's and mortgage?  You keep trying to downplay OPs words to make your argument.  He pays for most things in their relationship.", "He pays for meals out, which doesn't mean he pays for everything in their relationship....its his choice to take her for meals out just as it is her choice whether or not she cooks his meals", "He literally said \"I usually pay for everything\".  Again you're trying to minimize his impact on the relationship to make your point.\n\nYou're right it is both of their choice and I stated since she stopped cooking for him and brings nothing to the relationship op should  break up with her and find someone shares his values"]}
