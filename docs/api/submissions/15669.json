Years ago I moved to the basement of 1 of the houses where it\u2019s only a bedroom & bathroom. I have my own mini fridge & stuff down here & my brother moved to the basement next door where it\u2019s a kitchenbedroom & bathroom. We don\u2019t pay to live here.\n\nMy bro & I been planning on moving out for years due to my parents strict rules. it\u2019s a hassle if we want to go out with friends & my parents expect us to be out for 2 hours max & to be home by like 8-9pm when most of the time our friends don\u2019t leave the house until that time. I\u2019m not saying we want to be out all the time but if we been working for weeks & choose to want to go out for drinks for a night, its an argument. My brother has friends from other states who ask to sleep over when they are in our city but my dad makes it a big deal about having people come over. We have other arguments too about me being at college all day & they take it as \u201cbeing out\u201d or my dad checking my mileage on my car to see how long I been driving, etc. It got to the point where we both resent our parents (still love rhem) but we wish for our own space to thrive & have better mental health\n\nMy dad is planning on kicking out one of the tenants soon , remodeling the apartment & raising the rent to rerent. Even with the rent increase the apartment will still be cheaper then 90% of the apartments in the city. Except they are nervous about rerenting due to past issues with tenants we previously had. So my brother & I said we\u2019ll move in to the apartment & pay the rent since it\u2019s a 2 bedroom with living room kitchen & bathroom. My parents love the idea but said we still can\u2019t have friends over, they expect us to still be home at a certain time + they want to be able to walk in & out whenever. I said if we pay rent this will not be the case & we aren\u2019t going to listen to any rules b/c do you tell the other tenants they can\u2019t have people over? No. If you want me to listen to those rules then I\u2019m not paying rent & I\u2019ll stay in my basement until I save up money to move else where. Now my father is upset about us not wanting to listen to his rules even though we are still \u201cunder his roof\u201d & is upset we rather choose to live somewhere else. AITA for this?\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention the rent now is 900 for the 2 bedroom but when they remodel they want to bump it up to 1200.

Parents need to learn to let go and push the kids out of the nest to experience life and grow up. Kids should have the drive to get the hell away from the parents so they have a chance to see what it is to be 100% responsible for their lives. The wisdom that comes with falling short and not having a safety net, picking yourself up and trying again is invaluable. Neither you nor your brother have grown up yet. \n\nMom and Dad still see you as their kids and therefore their responsibility. It won't dawn on them until you get out and do things on your own. Until then, it's their world and you're choosing to live in it. \n\nDon't expect to get any more slack if you are still relying on them to subsidize your life. Between you and your brother, if you are both working minimum wage jobs, then you should be grossing 5 grand a month. After taxes, 3500-3800. Your rent costs at full price of $1200 is only 1/3 of your net monthly salaries. \n\nPart of growing up is learning to budget and improving your marketable skills to earn more than minimum wage. If you are 22 and can't afford to split rent with your brother, then you can't afford a dog either. \n\nYou are all A-holes in this case. Live with parents, forfeit your rights. Get  subsidized by living in parents apartment ,forfeit your rights. It sounds like it's time for all of you to grow up. Remember that parents are just kids with experience. They are still 12 years old mentally, just like all of us. Good luck and happy trails!", "Dude what are hell are you doing. Get your own place even if its more expensive and move out.", "Get roommates and move out.
