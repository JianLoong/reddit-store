When my parents moved to this country, they bought 2 houses next to each other. Each house is a 2 family with a 3rd half apartment in the basement. My parents live in 1 & rent out the other 3. Years ago I moved to the basement of 1 of the houses where it\u2019s only a bedroom & bathroom. I have my own mini fridge & stuff down here & my brother moved to the basement next door where it\u2019s a kitchenbedroom & bathroom. We don\u2019t pay to live here.\n\nMy bro & I been planning on moving out for years due to my parents strict rules. it\u2019s a hassle if we want to go out with friends & my parents expect us to be out for 2 hours max & to be home by like 8-9pm when most of the time our friends don\u2019t leave the house until that time. I\u2019m not saying we want to be out all the time but if we been working for weeks & choose to want to go out for drinks for a night, its an argument. My brother has friends from other states who ask to sleep over when they are in our city but my dad makes it a big deal about having people come over. We have other arguments too about me being at college all day & they take it as \u201cbeing out\u201d or my dad checking my mileage on my car to see how long I been driving, etc. It got to the point where we both resent our parents (still love rhem) but we wish for our own space to thrive & have better mental health\n\nMy dad is planning on kicking out one of the tenants soon , remodeling the apartment & raising the rent to rerent. Even with the rent increase the apartment will still be cheaper then 90% of the apartments in the city. Except they are nervous about rerenting due to past issues with tenants we previously had. So my brother & I said we\u2019ll move in to the apartment & pay the rent since it\u2019s a 2 bedroom with living room kitchen & bathroom. My parents love the idea but said we still can\u2019t have friends over, they expect us to still be home at a certain time + they want to be able to walk in & out whenever. I said if we pay rent this will not be the case & we aren\u2019t going to listen to any rules b/c do you tell the other tenants they can\u2019t have people over? No. If you want me to listen to those rules then I\u2019m not paying rent & I\u2019ll stay in my basement until I save up money to move else where. Now my father is upset about us not wanting to listen to his rules even though we are still \u201cunder his roof\u201d & is upset we rather choose to live somewhere else. AITA for this?\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention the rent now is 900 for the 2 bedroom but when they remodel they want to bump it up to 1200. However my dad said he\u2019ll charge us 800 if we decide to move in but we still have to listen to his rules. + I have a large dog most apts won\u2019t accept so his apt is the best option", "created_utc": 1682444965, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12yqlbd/aita_for_telling_my_parents_if_i_pay_rent_i_wont/", "score": 221, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA. \n\nBe warned - i dont know your parents so this is worst, WORST case scenario - that if you rent your parents may try to sneak some of their house rules into your lease agreement. \n\nIt's difficult for your parents because going from parent to landlord is a huge change in the dynamic in the family.

You are negotiating terms, and shouldn't rent if you can't  agree. It's not reasonable for your dad to be all \"my house my rules\" but then also upset that you want to move out.

They're level 100 controlling and that's not easy to get under control. If I were you I'd focus more on moving out, even if means finding a friend willing to adopt your dog.", "NTA.  There will be rules wherever you live.  Don\u2019t get me started on HOA\u2019s.  It sounds like your parents rules are way over the top, however.  At the end of the day it is their place and if they say those are the rules then you have 2 choices, follow them or find another place to live.  I\u2019d do the latter if I was you.

Honestly, I'd just get another apartment with brother that Dad doesn't own.  These rules would be too strict even if you both weren't adults.", "NTA, and honestly depending on where you live, a lot of what they're trying to impose is actually illegal.
