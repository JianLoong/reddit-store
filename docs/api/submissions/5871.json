I was gonna order Chinese because they like Chinese and it's my favourite ngl lol.\n\nMy stepmom started protesting and said that she won't eat Chinese. I asked why and she said she has OCD and just can't deal with eating anything from there because \"it might be dirty\". She said she'll only eat something from a big fast food chain. I didn't know this but tbh I've never spent much time with her.\n\nI told her it's not dirty. The Chinese takeaway I was going to order from, I happen to be friends with the owner's son. They are very serious about hygiene. She said she can't help it and she's going to think it's dirty. I told her that's too bad.\n\nMy stepsiblings started asking me if they could have something from the Chinese takeaway and I said sure. I ordered Chinese anyway, and my dad and stepmom ordered themselves Dominos. I thought that was the end of it.\n\nAfterwards my dad confronted me and said I need to apologise to my stepmom. He said I upset her big time and excluded her because of her mental illness. I didn't think it was a big deal but he's demanding I apologise.\n\nWas I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1672251148, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxgjn4/aita_for_ordering_something_my_stepmom_wouldnt/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Since you were ordering for everyone\u2026 it may not have been the worst thing for you to offer up some additional take out options and then placed the order for them around the same time, so hopefully everyone could eat dinner together.

Solving the issue was easy as two people wanting to order from 2 different places.", "NTA. Being stupid and/or racist isn't a mental illness that gets kids gloves. Anyway, I hate her, please keep doing shit like this.", "NTA -- and mental illness or racism? Because thinking only the food from a Chinese place is dirty vs fast food, where under-trained children and exhausted folks working the 3rd job are manhandling your fries sounds more like racism.  \n\n\nYou do not owe adults an apology for not buying them food. You fed their kids after all, they should be thanking you for the consideration. Or do they both have a condition that makes them incapable of gratitude?", "NTA. Your stepmom thinks Dominos is clean? But a Chinese restaurant can\u2019t be? Hmmmm", "NTA. Your stepmom's ocd shouldn't dictate your own life and actions, and it would be unhealthy for it to do so.

Possibly more so.", "I'm going to say NTA \u2014 ordering from two separate places is a pretty normal compromise under the circumstances (my husband and I do that semiregularly because he always wants pizza and I don't), but is anyone else getting racist vibes off the stepmom?", "NTA. Racism isn't a mental illness.", "NTA: her *condition* doesn't mean you should cater to her.  They ordered elsewhere which is fine.", "NTA. Sounds like your stepmother might be racist and thinks that it's \"dirty\" because of that. pretty much all the Chinese restaurants I've been to are cleaner than fast food restaurants.
