In November 2021, she asked me to move in with her, her fianc\u00e9 (M 30) and her brother (M 40.) My apartment wanted to raise my rent and they were saving for a wedding,so moving in would help each other out. I wasn\u2019t on the lease because the landlord would probably up the rent.\n\nI noticed after moving in that they\u2019d spend their money on things they never really used. Purses, shoes, random fandom decor, and they would go out to eat alot. Out-of-state vacations were every 2-3 months.\n\nI wasn\u2019t allowed to have people over. 3 months in I wanted to bring over my bf at the time. It caused a huge argument. After we broke up she was adamant that no one else was allowed to come over.  \n\nShe would go in my room when I wasn\u2019t there. In June she started to call it \u201cHER room\u201d that I \u201cwas RENTING\u201d so  she \u201ccan do whatever she wants.\u201d I changed the lock on the door without telling her & closed the door just to see what would happen. I came home to the door being open & the frame being cracked because I must\u2019ve \u201caccidentally locked myself out\u201d.\n\nIn July, the water heater blew up & caused a flood. Within the next few days, everyone got sick. When I asked her to get it checked for mold, she refused. Luckily, she didn\u2019t have to pay anything because the landlord covered fixing the water heater. She was relieved that she could still go on her California vacation but everyone in the house kept getting sick every couple of weeks. I purposely avoidedthe house so it didnt affect me quite as much as it used to when I was constantly there. In November 2022, I came home and found black mold literally growing on the bathroom ceiling in different spots. I confronted her about it multiple times and she said it\u2019s \u201ccalcium build up\u201d. \nIn December, they finally picked out a wedding date and venue. His parents told them that instead of paying for the whole thing like they originally said they would, they would only be paying for half because she wanted an \u201celegant\u201d look. Her parents are both passed away so it\u2019s up to the couple to pay for the other half. My friend started freaking out because they hadn\u2019t saved the entire year. \n\nIn early January, my brothers divorce was finalized and he got the house. He asked me if I\u2019d like to rent out a room as he\u2019d rarely be home.  Hes charging me next to nothing. It\u2019s honestly an offer I couldnt refuse. \n\nI took them out to eat in public and told them. I paid them for February\u2019s rent even though I had my stuff moved out before the end of January. They were shocked and went silent until last week when I was flooded with texts. Apparently I\u2019m completely fucking them over. They said they\u2019re going to have to change the venue and she might have to return her $1500 dress. They wanted me to know about how badly I fucked them over. She asked if I could spot her some money every now and then to help make up for my betrayal. To be honest I\u2019m over this friendship.

Plus you weren\u2019t allowed to have guests and your privacy wasn\u2019t being respected. Moving out was the smart thing to do. It\u2019s clear that Cara only asked you to move in with her so she could use your rent to live a more comfortable lifestyle. Think about it: if they asked you to move in so they could save up for their wedding, why did they freak out when they learned his parents were only going to pay half the costs? After a year of having a roommate, they should have had a good portion of money saved up. You don\u2019t owe her anything. She should have been more a responsible adult and a much better friend. It would probably be best to end the friendship.", "NTA. How is paying for their wedding your responsibility?

I wouldn't blame you if you had left sooner. \n\nI once was renting a room in a 3BR with two other girls but wasn't on the lease. It was a bad neighborhood and they were bad room mates. I found a new place and gave them 3 weeks notice. In our city, you can find a room mate in 3 days never mind 3 weeks, so I thought I was being pretty fair. Well they flipped and told me I owed them rent for that month anyway. I refused (not much they could do because I wasn't on the lease) but gave them 1-week's rent since I wanted to play nice and I knew I was shorting them the standard 4-week notice. When I move out I forgot to take a floor lamp and they texted me saying they wanted to me pay them for its \"disposal\". Mind you, that was the only light source in that dark, dirty living room so I doubt they actually got rid of it. Also, the dumpster was 10 steps away from the apartment so I'm sure disposing of all 8 lbs of it took little to no effort.

Or you can keep it simple and say the less expensive rent was simply not something you could afford to pass up.  You gave them notice and paid an extra month of rent and they are still bitching?  Ugh.  These people have shown you who they are and their actions show they do not respect you at all or give a whit for your health, safety or personhood.

If they needed your money to afford their wedding, they sure should\u2019ve tried to make their home a place you wanted to pay money to stay in.", "I moved in with a friend once and things went\u2026similarly. I moved in in like the first week of the month because my previous roommate was being super controlling (a couple where the guy was pretty sexist sometimes and I am female) and she had an extra room and didn\u2019t really know how she was going to regularly make the $900 house payment on her own and according to her, her arranged roommates weren\u2019t moving in for like 3-4 months and I had to go back to dorms in about 2.5 so worked perfectly ~cue eyeroll~. So since it was the beginning of the month, I had *just* paid my rent for my old place (I know the way I left there was VERY assholey even with the way the guy had been acting. I was young and a bit more hotheaded) but she asked if I could pay anything toward rent for her but no big deal since she wasn\u2019t expecting it to begin with. I responded that I could but since I had just paid rent it would have to happen slowly for that particular month but everything else I would have by the due date. 3 weeks or so later I get a text about when I would have it to her and I said that I could get her X amount (I think it was around a quarter of the total) when I got paid and that I was sorry that it had taken so long for me to start giving her her installments and I get a text along the lines of \u201cI know I didn\u2019t agree to that because I would never agree to something like that\u201d. I also got chewed out for leaving a singular pair of running shorts in the living room for a week all while she had random crap laying around as well up until I got called out of my room from watching tv for her confrontation. She also worked overnight on the weekends so she\u2019d be gone for 48 hours straight. Normally that would be awesome\u2026but she had a dog. The dog was great, don\u2019t get me wrong there. And I also agreed to walking him on the weekends when I was moving in. What I did not agree to was finding via Snapchat story (multiple times I might add) that she had taken an impromptu 4 hour road trip and was staying with a friend that night. Her dog would regularly reach over 12 hours without a walk while being crated because he\u2019d tear the house up if he wasn\u2019t. One time she was redoing the caulking in the bathroom and she was telling us to not leave the door open so the dog didn\u2019t go eat it. My boyfriend at the time and myself already always shut the door and we responded that it wouldn\u2019t be a problem because of that. Multiple times that night he or I walked out of the room to see the bathroom door open. And of course the next day was the start of her 48 hours. And of course her dog was vomiting feces when I woke up. I had to go to work but I told my friend what was happening and gave her my boyfriends number and him hers and he dropped me off at work so he\u2019d have my car because we just knew the dog needed to go to the vet but owner said to wait a bit and see if he stopped because we were all poor and she was hoping for the best. While I was at work I get messages blaming me and/or my boyfriend for letting the dog eat caulking. When I got home I had the bitter sweet pleasure of telling her my boyfriend found the source of the vomiting. She had not walked him before leaving that day and he pooped and took a couple bites and that set it all off. I assume she had also forgotten to feed him that morning as well. Relating to the 48 hour job thing. One weekend on the night before she came back, we noticed that she had forgotten to put away the rack of ribs she had cooked in the oven the night before leaving. I decided not my problem and left it and the not rude but harrowing part is that she fried them up and ate them when she got home. That made me happy I didn\u2019t just toss it like every single reaction to meat being out that long that I have because I knew that would have been a huge fight. And that\u2019s not even getting into anything related to the abusive boyfriend she had that was supposed to not overlap with me being there but surprise surprise he came back over a month early. That fallout was bad. ETA: I meant to make it clear and realized I didn\u2019t but when the dog would go so long without a walk, I genuinely had no clue how long it had been. I would always naively assume that she walked him shortly before when she would leave knowing it was for an undetermined amount of time. And 95% of the times I would just think how long it had been since I last knew she was home and I would ask her if her dog needed walked. At first I waited for the response but then I would ask her and just grab the leash. At that point I was just wondering how long it had actually been that time. She would rarely contact me to ask me to walk him. I almost always had to take pity on the poor dog because there\u2019s no point in letting him suffer because she was being negligent when I had fully expressed permission to take him on walks whenever I felt like even if he didn\u2019t need it because he\u2019s a husky which is super high energy", "NTA.
