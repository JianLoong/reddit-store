In November 2021, she asked me to move in with her, her fianc\u00e9 (M 30) and her brother (M 40.) My apartment wanted to raise my rent and they were saving for a wedding,so moving in would help each other out. I wasn\u2019t on the lease because the landlord would probably up the rent.\n\nI noticed after moving in that they\u2019d spend their money on things they never really used. Purses, shoes, random fandom decor, and they would go out to eat alot. Out-of-state vacations were every 2-3 months.\n\nI wasn\u2019t allowed to have people over. 3 months in I wanted to bring over my bf at the time. It caused a huge argument. After we broke up she was adamant that no one else was allowed to come over.  \n\nShe would go in my room when I wasn\u2019t there. In June she started to call it \u201cHER room\u201d that I \u201cwas RENTING\u201d so  she \u201ccan do whatever she wants.\u201d I changed the lock on the door without telling her & closed the door just to see what would happen. I came home to the door being open & the frame being cracked because I must\u2019ve \u201caccidentally locked myself out\u201d.\n\nIn July, the water heater blew up & caused a flood. Within the next few days, everyone got sick. When I asked her to get it checked for mold, she refused. Luckily, she didn\u2019t have to pay anything because the landlord covered fixing the water heater. She was relieved that she could still go on her California vacation but everyone in the house kept getting sick every couple of weeks. I purposely avoidedthe house so it didnt affect me quite as much as it used to when I was constantly there. In November 2022, I came home and found black mold literally growing on the bathroom ceiling in different spots. I confronted her about it multiple times and she said it\u2019s \u201ccalcium build up\u201d. \nIn December, they finally picked out a wedding date and venue. His parents told them that instead of paying for the whole thing like they originally said they would, they would only be paying for half because she wanted an \u201celegant\u201d look. Her parents are both passed away so it\u2019s up to the couple to pay for the other half. My friend started freaking out because they hadn\u2019t saved the entire year. \n\nIn early January, my brothers divorce was finalized and he got the house. He asked me if I\u2019d like to rent out a room as he\u2019d rarely be home.  Hes charging me next to nothing. It\u2019s honestly an offer I couldnt refuse. \n\nI took them out to eat in public and told them. I paid them for February\u2019s rent even though I had my stuff moved out before the end of January. They were shocked and went silent until last week when I was flooded with texts. Apparently I\u2019m completely fucking them over. They said they\u2019re going to have to change the venue and she might have to return her $1500 dress. They wanted me to know about how badly I fucked them over. She asked if I could spot her some money every now and then to help make up for my betrayal. To be honest I\u2019m over this friendship.

I moved out of the house to save money for myself.\n2. My roommates were saving for a wedding and I moved out after his parents announced they were only paying for half instead of the whole thing.

Clearly and unequivocally.\n\nIt\u2019s not even just the money issue, it\u2019s a full on toxic environment issue. Literally and figuratively.", "Nta you should have moved out sooner", "Absolutely NTA. There was mold in the apartment that your so called friend was refusing to take care of. Plus you weren\u2019t allowed to have guests and your privacy wasn\u2019t being respected. Moving out was the smart thing to do. It\u2019s clear that Cara only asked you to move in with her so she could use your rent to live a more comfortable lifestyle. Think about it: if they asked you to move in so they could save up for their wedding, why did they freak out when they learned his parents were only going to pay half the costs? After a year of having a roommate, they should have had a good portion of money saved up. You don\u2019t owe her anything. She should have been more a responsible adult and a much better friend. It would probably be best to end the friendship.", "NTA. How is paying for their wedding your responsibility? They didn't save a dime for their own wedding, and they were completely blowing their money.\n\nShe also didn't respect your friendship. Insisting you weren't allowed to bring anyone over and by breaking into your room. I'm surprised you didn't move out right then.\n\nWouldn't the landlord be on the hook for the black mold, too?", "NTA Your privacy was violated, you weren't given full use of the home you were paying to live in, and your health was potentially threatened. If the actual landlord had been treating you this way, you could break the lease and likely sue them.", "NTA and that's a friendship that's best left in the past. Block their numbers, and move on without them.", "NTA. She's not a friend. She was looking for some financial contribution to maintain her lifestyle while treating you like shit, not giving you privacy and not allowing you to have anyone over. That's not a housing situation, that's being grounded by someone who's not your parents. \n\nYou don't owe them shit. Who cares what they feel. Their wedding, their problems. They will have trouble finding someone who would put up with being treated that way as a tenant. \n\nCut her out of your life. Block her number. She's not a friend. She's a user who took advantage of you and is upset she can't continue to do so.b", "NTA\n\nVery self centered folks.  They should have been saving up instead of relying on passive income to pay for their elaborate wedding.", "Nta. When you mentioned her saying it was her room I thought she owned the property. She doesn't come off as a nice person. Go enjoy your own space without her negativity.", "NTA\n\nThey likely illegally subleased to you, illegally forbade you typical use of the residence as a tenant, and then are shocked you moved out? This is not a friend.", "NTA. You've been more than generous giving them a month's extra rent and notice.  You weren't on the lease.  They violated your privacy and endangered your health with black mold.  Surprised you lasted as long as you did.\n\nDon't give her any more money.", "Nta. Please never allow these users in your life ever again.", "NTA - Not your job to pay for these toxic peoples Wedding. You need out and out you should go.", ">To be honest I\u2019m over this friendship\n\nWhat friendship? That's not your friend\n\nNTA. And do better for yourself in future. You put yourself through way too much, letting yourself get used and treated like that.", "Definitely NTA", "NTA you're just unlucky to have this kind of \"friends\"", "I'm going to say NTA. They refused to allow you guests, invades your privacy, broke into your room, put your health at risk, and have the nerve to blame you for leaving? And then blame you leaving for not being able to afford the wedding she wants even though they spend frivolously knowing they had planned an expensive wedding? This woman is not your friend, she is a toxic sponge.", "NTA. They're acting like slumlords by proxy. I wouldn't blame you if you had left sooner. \n\nI once was renting a room in a 3BR with two other girls but wasn't on the lease. It was a bad neighborhood and they were bad room mates. I found a new place and gave them 3 weeks notice. In our city, you can find a room mate in 3 days never mind 3 weeks, so I thought I was being pretty fair. Well they flipped and told me I owed them rent for that month anyway. I refused (not much they could do because I wasn't on the lease) but gave them 1-week's rent since I wanted to play nice and I knew I was shorting them the standard 4-week notice. When I move out I forgot to take a floor lamp and they texted me saying they wanted to me pay them for its \"disposal\". Mind you, that was the only light source in that dark, dirty living room so I doubt they actually got rid of it. Also, the dumpster was 10 steps away from the apartment so I'm sure disposing of all 8 lbs of it took little to no effort. I told them to have a nice life.\n\nAll this to say... don't feel bad and don't take any crap.", "NTA - They fucked around and found out.", "NTA. Your friend has some nerve. You told them in January, left the end of Jan. and paid for Feb. They screwed themselves by not saving money for the entire year you were there. I'd be over this friendship too. Still not over that she flooded you with angry texts saying you screwed them over then proceeded to ask you for money \"now and then\". The gall.", "NTA. \n\nSorry that you lost a long time, friend. That's the worst part.", "NTA - that is not a friend but a user.  Cut her out of your life.  She will always be whining, trying to guilt you to do what she wants and just be a.miserable friend.  You don\u2019t need that in your life.", "NTA, all of this is on them.\n\nThey blew through their money like it was going out of style, let black mold grow in the bathroom which will likely affect everyone\u2019s health later on down the line. \n\nShe went to your room continuously without permission and broke the door bc it was locked. Idk what the heck she was doing by going in there but make sure you aren\u2019t missing jewelry, clothes or accessories. \n\nHonestly moving out will save you money, your mental health and the stress of everything. \n\nBut in no way are you an AH. NTA.", "Nta\n\n\nBlock them. They are users. Their bad choices are not your problem.", "NTA. Poor planning on her part doesn't constitute an emergency on yours. They had plenty of time to save up money, treated you like shit, and disregarded your very valid heath concerns. They all sound like a bunch of dicks.", "NTA. Go live the life you want & put your former friends where they belong, in the rearview mirror.", "NTA. Block them and move on with your life with real friends, not these people who are just out to use you as a supplemental bank.", "NTA.  These people are acting entitled to a wedding they cannot afford and instead of blaming themselves are blaming you.  If you have the energy to respond I would tell them about the mold, the water heater issue, the invasion of privacy and just say you were unhappy and are not compatible as roommates.  Or you can keep it simple and say the less expensive rent was simply not something you could afford to pass up.  You gave them notice and paid an extra month of rent and they are still bitching?  Ugh.  These people have shown you who they are and their actions show they do not respect you at all or give a whit for your health, safety or personhood.  I would cut these people out ASAP in your position.", "NTA- there is a price you pay for trying to control people to the point of isolation and not respecting their privacy and boundaries.

Franknly I wouldn't even continue to be friends with someone like this.", "NTA. You definitely need some space from this person.

She felt entitled to your room to do Chuck only knows what, refused to let you have visitors, misused their own money knowing they have a wedding and bills. You weren't on the lease so you don't owe them any contracted days of leaving or fees to break lease. You were more then generous to give a month's rent for a place you won't be in. She has no legal legs to stand on. Move out and move on. They can get second jobs to pay for th unexpected expenses of their wedding.", "NTA\n\nYou had a better offer.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be expected to sabotage your own life, health, safety, and finances for someone else\u2019s bills. Especially not when they\u2019ve been burning money on vacations and other unnecessary items.\n\nIt sounds like the friendship has been over for a while, and after the way you have been treated - which includes her exploiting your friendship - perhaps it\u2019s for the best.\n\n> She asked if I could spot her some money every now and then to help make up for my betrayal.\n\nshe should have been a better landlord/roommate.

Too bad for her I guess.", "I am literally laughing when she asked to give you some money for the \u2018betrayal\u2019. Like wtf, which betrayed? The betrayal of not leaving sooner. NTA", "NTA\n\nObviously the home is not good for your health, boundaries are being crossed, and you can't even have guests.\n\nI think you shouldn't be so judgmental about people buying things like \"purses, shoes, random fandom decor\".
