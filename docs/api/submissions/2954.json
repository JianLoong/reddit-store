The fiance is in the wrong for asking the opinion of OP and then being mad when an opinion is given, especially since OP is likely more familiar with what the norm for dressing at this event will be. However, assuming the dress isn't completely inappropriate, OP should not insist that the fiance changes or argue over what is ultimately her decision. Unless the dress is so innapropriate that she would not be allowed in or possibly ridiculed for wearing it, you should respect what she chooses to wear even if it is a different fit or style than you might prefer her to wear.

Automatically, because this is what I was taught from childhood. She knows this, especially if she comes from generational wealth. \n\nFWIW, I cringed at the part where you wrote she \"jokes about me being the token diversity hire\".

If you said to her what you wrote in this post, that \u201cit is not skintight \u2026.& hugs your body in appropriate ways\u201d, then you set yourself up to fail. You were implying negative things about her body & her taste in clothes, and indicating that you are embarrassed by her sometimes.\n\nAs a woman I can tell you that the pressure on women to look a certain way is tremendous.

I love you whatever you wear.\u201d And if she presses you, you can say something like, \u201cI really like how that color brings out the beauty of your skin.\u201d If she wears the \u2018wrong\u2019 thing, she is still your chosen person, she will still shine.

She\u2019s like \u201cNO NOT THAT ONE! YOU DON\u2019T RESPECT ME AND MY STYLE.\u201d Like .. wut?", "One was not as nice. That\u2019s saying it politely. It looked like it was lounge wear and lounge clothes.", "It\u2019s both. It was a softer, less nice material and hugged her body. Active type wear that most young people wear at even some corporate jobs but I assumed she would know that a special work event is different.", "You can ask for an opinion without obeying it.\n\nJust because she wanted to know which one he liked better, doesn\u2019t mean she was going to base her decision on that alone.", "Thank you for this.", "If that was the point, then wouldn\u2019t have been better to just say \u201cShe has a good income.\u201d? The plantation money comment was unnecessary and rude as hell.", "That was completely unnecessary clarification, and it was really unclear that this was your intention. She obviously owns *both* dresses, of course she can afford nicer clothes. \nHonestly, the \u201cwhite, cis, plantation money\u201d comments were totally irrelevant to your post, and make it sound like you harbor some real resentment. Based on some of your other comments re: her drama, that resentment might be perfectly justified, but if you don\u2019t like her or feel respected by her, why are you with her?", "I do. She seemed at the ready and even said she knew I would pick the second one. And if it was a test, I failed miserably. I don\u2019t say anything when she wears stuff on her own. To meet my parents, to other community events. But this was a one time work event.", "I\u2019m also stuck on the part where an \u201cexecutive at a big company\u201d who maintains a very different work wardrobe from what she wears at home is acting like she doesn\u2019t understand the concept of applying professional dress standards to a partner\u2019s work event.", "What\u2019s left out is that she loves drama.", "She regularly cries over small disputes. For example, when we first met her parents she referred to me as just a friend even though we had been dating for a year. I said I needed to take a walk and clear my mind. She cried and asked if this means we are breaking up. \n\nShe cries frequently. And I often don\u2019t know what I did to make her cry. This is legitimately what I said and did. I\u2019m not deliberately leaving something out.", "We are definitely missing info here. My guess is the lack of said information makes OP look better. \n\nCant vote until I know more of the conversations that took place.", "Why is it rude if it\u2019s accurate?", "All right, that is pretty unfair of her. You picked out the dress you liked. There's nothing wrong with picking a dress that isn't your partner's usual style if they are the one who is giving you it as an option. If she wasn't open to wearing it, she shouldn't have asked you in the first place to choose.", "And you want to marry this person? This sounds like hell: every day, week, month you\u2019re just trying to figure out why your partner is upset what you did wrong. Sounds like a miserable walking on eggshells experience.", "Are you sure you want to marry her? She seems to be spoiled and entitled. The fact that you said she comes from plantation money and you don\u2019t, seems like this was the indicator for her behavior.", "Sounds exhausting", "it\u2019s not rude. but dude, she\u2019s racist if she\u2019s using micro aggressions against YOU!! you\u2019re worth more than that", "Because you\u2019re coming as off as seriously judge mental of her background, regardless if it\u2019s accurate or not. And not to mention, it\u2019s irrelevant to the issue at hand, which was the dress she chose to wear for your work event."]}
