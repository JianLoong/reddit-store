The fiance is in the wrong for asking the opinion of OP and then being mad when an opinion is given, especially since OP is likely more familiar with what the norm for dressing at this event will be. However, assuming the dress isn't completely inappropriate, OP should not insist that the fiance changes or argue over what is ultimately her decision. Unless the dress is so innapropriate that she would not be allowed in or possibly ridiculed for wearing it, you should respect what she chooses to wear even if it is a different fit or style than you might prefer her to wear.

I work from home and loooooooove the fact that I can wear whatever unless I'm at a virtual meeting or a webinar. However, for work-related, in-person meetings and work/organization events, I wear what is appropriate and tend to err the more formal side. Automatically, because this is what I was taught from childhood. She knows this, especially if she comes from generational wealth. \n\nFWIW, I cringed at the part where you wrote she \"jokes about me being the token diversity hire\".

Her calling you a \u201ctoken\u201d at your job as a \u201cjoke\u201d is gross and frankly a micro aggression itself.

If you said to her what you wrote in this post, that \u201cit is not skintight \u2026.& hugs your body in appropriate ways\u201d, then you set yourself up to fail. You were implying negative things about her body & her taste in clothes, and indicating that you are embarrassed by her sometimes.\n\nAs a woman I can tell you that the pressure on women to look a certain way is tremendous.

I love you whatever you wear.\u201d And if she presses you, you can say something like, \u201cI really like how that color brings out the beauty of your skin.\u201d If she wears the \u2018wrong\u2019 thing, she is still your chosen person, she will still shine.

This wasn't a demand from you", "I'm with the majority of commenters below me on this one that you're NTA, I just wanted to add that if I were in your shoes the jokes about being the \"token diversity hire\" would hit me entirely the wrong way, well-meaning or otherwise.   \nIt's my opinion that far too often humor is used as a mask to cover a person's true opinions and I always see right through it. Seems like a red flag to me, but of course you know your person better than I do!   \n\n\nAlso.. the whole stereotypical \"which dress should I wear\" but actually IT'S A TRAP because there's a right and wrong answer is utter bullshit and totally manipulative.

Why did she ask your opinion if she as immediately going to get upset at your response and then ignore it anyways? The last relationship I was in my significant other would get invited to work events and always asked for my opinion on their outfit for the exact reason of making sure it looked nice and was appropriate for the event which I really appreciated.", "NTA. Just because she asked you to choose between two options. That\u2019s all you did.", "NTA, she picked the two dress herself so how is wearing one of them denying her self expression? She liked it enough to show it to you so it should express her tastes.  If one of those choices wasn\u2019t to her liking why did she have it at all?  She asked and you answered.  It\u2019s not like you went out and bought a dress and made her wear it.  I have no clue why she\u2019s mad that you insisted on her wearing the dress she initially suggested as an option.  It\u2019s also a work event, not a regular social function so she should respect your opinion (which she asked for) in order to protect your job.", "NTA for the dress. I\u2019d always consider my partners opinion if we were to attend an event that is for their job/company or even family. But I don\u2019t understand why the other information is needed - sounds like you have some pent up resentment toward your gf socio-economic upbringing and doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re both on the same page.

She sounds incredibly immature since she's still pulling this nonsense as a 30 year old with a high paying job, so I can't see how she got that job without help.  She asked you your opinion over the two dresses, you gave it, then she proceeded to flip out at you saying you were rejecting her for who she is, then called you controlling.  If she wanted to wear the other dress, why even ask you to begin with?  Also, given that you said she's from generational money, I'm guessing she should be well aware of how you are supposed to dress for a fancy cocktail party at an art gallery.  Basically, she knows how she is supposed to dress, then gave you a test that she set you up to fail for.  If you chose the appropriate dress, she gets to be angry at you.  If you chose the inappropriate dress, she gets to go and make a show of herself while making you look bad with coworkers.\n\n\nAlso her remarks about you being the token diversity at your university really rub me the wrong way.  She's implying that you didn't earn your job on your own merit and hard work and are only there because they need diversity.\n\n\nThe long and short of this is that I don't think your fiance actually has any respect for you.  She set you up for a test that you were doomed to fail, either by damage to your relationship or damage to your professional relationships all while acting like you were in the wrong and also treating you as somewhat undeserving of your job.
