Having special needs is a reason for bad behavior, but it's not an excuse.", "NTA", "It\u2019s not unusual for mentally disabled men to not be taught the meaning of consent.

Either i can behave and or i can't go to places alone. OP is 15. She also works as a lifeguard, so she needs her focus. She can't be distrurbed by some guy how maybe touch her more next time. Her boss need to support his employees and keep them save. They should have give this guy a warning long before. To put OP in this situation in which she feels guilty for doing the right thing, is just shitty. Especially the mother is an Asshole for guilt-tripping her daughter. Does she prefer that she get sexual harassed instead that some old man gets banned from some indoor swimming bath?! Just wow.\n\nNTA", "Imagine him doing that to a girl.. making her boyfriend or dad really mad. He could put himself in danger if he doesn't know any boundries. \n\nI know a men who act really young. Just a kid. Playing with children. But he looks like a men. I don't know everything.. but he almost got hit by a dad. I know he's harmles but i understand that a parent good be really mad, seeing an adult with your kid", "If they are strict about protecting you then why haven't they talked to him yet \ud83d\ude33 I don't think they care about you at all", "I have autism myself. So i worked at a place with a lot special needs people. An old men really hit us hard. And kicked us. It really hurts but nobody helped us. Because he didn't know any better. He was an old men so i didn't felt comfterble to hit him back. But it makes me really sad they let him hurt us", "The disability DOES define us. We wouldn\u2019t be us without it, we would  someone with a completely different personality.", "Wait my comment was stolen? What did theirs even say?", "It was just a partial copy/paste of your \u201cand I say this as a disabled person myself\u201d without any context.", "Huh, weird", "NTA. It's kind of you to be considerate of his needs, but your needs need to also be considered-- as do your coworkers'. His cognitive abilities and disabilities are important to consider when deciding what action to take, but at the end of the day the impact on you and the other lifeguards (not feeling safe or comfortable in your workplace because he is not respecting your physical boundaries) outweighs the impact on him (possibly no longer being allowed to hang out at the water park).\n\nIt's good to know that this isn't a direct threat, the way a strange grown man touching you without consent usually would be seen, but that doesn't make it comfortable or okay.", "NTA. I worked at a store where a six foot man with special needs sometimes came in and wanted to tell unwilling people (employees and customers alike) really gross and inappropriate stories (ex: about a drunk guy f***ing a horse and dying in the act). We were fully backed by our manager to kick him out when he did these things. Special needs certainly can call for more grace, but it doesn't mean trampling everyone else's boundaries.", "NTA", "Nta he still needs to learn right from wrong and not tough you. Report him and you can definitely tell him not to touch you.", "NTA\n\n\"Special needs\" doesn't automatically mean someone is incapable of understanding sexual harassment. Maybe he will have trouble understanding. Maybe he won't. Just letting it go and not talking to him about it isn't helping anyone. \n\nAnd I do just want to add...if this man is independently coming to the pool and following other rules and regulations, then I doubt the one thing he \"can't understand\" is to not blow kisses at underaged girls. (If he has a care taker, this may be a different story)", "NTA.   I went to church with a man with Downs Syndrome who was very touchy feely around women.  I spoke with a friend that taught Special Education in school system for years about him.  She told me that there was often an either-or attitude regarding sex with people with mental disabilities, either they thought about it a lot, or they never concerned themselves with sex, but either way, the best way to handle his roving hands was to tell him outright that he should not touch anyone in that manner without their permission. I did, he listened.  This gentleman hopefully will do the same.", "NTA but your mom is for saying \u201c because he didn\u2019t mean anything by it and doesn\u2019t know better \u201d\n\nNobody has a right to touch you- special needs or not. Your mom should not be trying to teach you that it\u2019s ok for others (especially men) to violate you because they  \u2018didn\u2019t mean anything by it and don\u2019t know better.\u2019\nIt\u2019s time this man learns that it\u2019s not ok to touch other people without permission.  Maybe getting banned is the lesson he needs to finally learn this. \nHowever, you could consider speaking to the man if you wish and telling him that you don\u2019t like what he\u2019s doing or ask management to speak to him. If he stops- great. If he doesn\u2019t then you can still file a complaint. It\u2019s up to you though if you want to give him verbal notice once before filing a complaint.", "Also lifeguards should not be distracted for any reason and should not be talked to and he should know that by now, frankly the pool management is failing by not making that clear to him or anyone else who approaches a lifeguard", "NTA- One of the senates in my area was sexually harassing women and blamed it on his ADHD. Playing the \u201cspecial needs\u201d card makes ACTUAL people with special needs (I am autistic) look like a joke and strongly implies all negative stereotypes on said people. \n\nFuck that creep.", "NTA. Your mom is an asshole for not caring about her teenage daughter being sexually harassed and your employer is an asshole for the \"physical touching has to happen for a report to be made\" policy.", "NTA just because he's special needs doesn't give him a pass for being a predator. He's clearly targeting underage lifeguards including you, protect yourself.", "NTA - it honestly does not matter if he \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean anything by it\u201d or that he\u2019s dealing with some unspecified MH condition. It is wildly inappropriate behavior that makes you uncomfortable. That wouldn\u2019t be okay in any scenario, but it is especially problematic here because (1) you are a child and he is an adult; (2) you are in a bathing suit; and (3) you are at work, so you can\u2019t remove yourself from the situation. Please do not feel bad. It is not your fault if he is banned - if he honest-to-god cannot understand that his behavior is inappropriate, he shouldn\u2019t be out without an aid or something. That\u2019s not your responsibility to let him touch, talk to, and look at you in ways that make you uncomfortable.", "He\u2019s not special needs\u2026he\u2019s pervy old man. One karate chop to throat should solve this for you pretty quickly.", "NTA at all", "Nope. You don\u2019t get to be inappropriate and make other people uncomfortable just because you have special needs. Absolutely not. There is never an okay reason for an adult man to be touching an underaged girl, especially when she\u2019s in a bathing suit. If he can\u2019t follow that rule, he should either be spoken to seriously or justifiably kicked out. You DO NOT have to feel bad!!", "First of all, you're literally 15 and he is an 80 year old man so I'm really not liking your mother stinking by your side. First it's your toe, then leg, then butt. We don't even know what type of special needs he is/has. Could he be completely harmless? Maybe but maybe not and why risk that. Plus if he is this bad to where he physically cannot control him, shouldn't there be a care giver for him? Someone who is aware of his behavior to make sure he doesn't act on it. Being special needs is never a free pass for physically touching someone. Plus there's soooo many special needs people out there who KNOW it is not okay to touch people", "Every place I ever lifeguarded there was an old creep who harrasses the female lifeguards.  Also - they always went for the youngest/most unsure/ girls who tried to be nice because they knew the older hardened veterans would not put up with their shit.  This dude has not lived 80 years of life able and be able to go to the pool without a caretaker without learning that it is not ok to put your hands on young girls (or older girls, or women, or ANYONE).  Heck, my husband used to work with special needs people who did have caretakers, and they still knew that.  He can't go through life putting his hands on people he thinks are too timid to push back - if he isn't behaving appropriately he needs to be banned.  That is not your fault.   \n\nBut also - you do not need to be friendly to people who make you uncomfortable.  I know you have been socialized to smooth over awkward social situations because you are young and a woman and that is something society puts on you - but stop.  Listen to your own instincts- you can be cool and distant with people who give you the creeps - that is fine and ok.  Maybe go Google Captain Awkard, she has some fantastic advice that I wish I had read when I was 15 and working in a bathing suit every day.  You don't have to laugh off being uncomfortable, you don't have to smile and be nice to someone you don't want near you!", "Right?? Wtf is the manager doing??", "He should have been banned already by now. I'd be surprised if your one report got him banned, actually, since most people refuse to ban anyone from anything.", "I know someone who had a special needs coworker who was trying to kiss women he felt friendly with. He didn't mean badly by it, but it was inappropriate and of course it especially freaked out the young women working there. A manager called up his care worker and told her about the problem. She worked with the special needs guy on it, and he doesn't do it anymore. \n\nThere is a way to deal with this that is compassionate to the needs of both sides and gives him a chance to change his behavior. \n\nI am mad for you OP because this could be solved *so* quickly if your manager gave a shit.\n\nFirst, the man is being inappropriate even if he never touched any of y'all. This should not have been allowed to go on this long. Second, if this man has a caretaker or guardian or an assigned social worker, I expect there's a way to get in contact with them and explain the situation. Doesn't the pool keep emergency contact forms for members? Or simply ask the guy for the caregiver's contact. Your supervisor could have done that ages ago. \n\nYour compassion is wonderful. The problem is that your supervisor is failing you right now. He oversees teenage girls and that comes with some effing responsibility. I suggest you and the other affected guards get your parents and discuss this with your supervisor as a group. Your boss needs to be much more active in resolving these situations and deal with it WAY EARLIER.", "Honestly, they don't seem to be strict about that at all.", "Personally the manager is the one who is utterly failing this situation. The manager could talk to this man and try to contact the guy's caretakers to work on changing this behavior. The manager's comment on requiring \"contact\" sounds like wishy washy bs to me."]}
