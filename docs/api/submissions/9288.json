Someone does need to speak with him and set boundaries which is what should have happened long ago. Living with a disability does not give free reign to do whatever they want. They still need to observe the rules of society and act accordingly. \n\nYou can also talk to him. You can tell him it makes you uncomfortable. You can tell him that this is where you work and he needs to be more respectful.

Other people argue for identity-first language on the grounds that their identity is a central part of them, and not some kind of add-on.\n\n\"Proper use\" would in general to be to follow the preference of the person in question. In general, I find that Deaf people and autistic people tend to prefer identity-first language, whereas people who use wheelchairs or who have various disabilities that affect their ability to move prefer person-first language, but that's not a rule, and you will certainly find members of each group who have the opposite opinion.", "This isn\u2019t set in stone and varies, some prefer disabled person, some prefer \u2018person first\u2019 language as you\u2019ve described.

They\u2019ll teach you that in school, but it\u2019s not really that accurate when it comes to the actual disabled community. And I\u2019m someone who is disabled AND has a career where I studied disability for some time as well. \n\nIt\u2019s very dependent on the actual disability. Deaf and autistic people usually prefer identity first language! Because they\u2019re not someone \u201cwith deafness\u201d, they are deaf. Being deaf informs every bit of their lived experienced. The same goes for those of us who are neurodivergent; it impacts every facet of my life, it IS who we are. \n\nThe real issue is able bodied people somehow finding it offensive to just call us what we are or feeling too uncomfortable with disability to use that language.  \n\nMirror the language that that person uses. And again, if you\u2019re tapped into disabled communities, you\u2019d find that person-first language is actually preferred far less, as it perpetuates the stigma that disability is something to be ashamed of. \n\nI\u2019d be happy to share some resources, but just know that what they teach you, is almost never based off of the opinions of disabled people.

So, until that point is is best to go with the safer route. I have a physical disability and work with children and adults with disabilities and I would rather someone err on the side of caution than make an assumption and that is how we teach our advocacy. So, someone who does not know the terminology (if only they would teach this in school\u2026 it is certainly not where I am from), it is best to educate on the side of caution rather than make an assumption about someone with a disability.", "Right but I\u2019m saying that the way advocacy is taught does not include the opinions of disabled people. Therefore, the advocacy is far more centered on able bodied people than disabled people. I was taught the exact same thing, but I recognize that it does not align with the lives experiences of disabled people. I\u2019m in many different disabled communities online and in person, and I will ALWAYS follow that over textbooks written by abled people who failed to consult the disabled community"]}
