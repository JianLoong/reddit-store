How long would you go no contact? forever? I get being protective of your child but maybe there's something else going on with the 5 year old. Did you used like her? Did you use to pay POSITIVE attention to her? If you want to go no contact, more power to you but this sounds like a close family. As long as you don't demand your husband goes no contact too, you can do what you want. I've seen one of my 18 month old grandchildren go after the older kids. Everyone gets time out if they can't all behave. My oldest son wanted me to return his brother. He picked on his brother. My second picked on my 3rd. They pick on each other still in their 30s but I never had them go no contact. They are the first to come running when one or the other needs something. Your kids are cousins.
