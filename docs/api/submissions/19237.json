That's basic common sense. And if you aren't aware of even that and thought your conduct was totally fine here, safe to say there's been more going on that you're not writing out here.", "I am guessing you where a younger mom when the oldest was born. That oldest child does have different consequences. We are all guilty. As a first time mom we are learning how to parent this little person. \n\nMost of us are not use to having small children so we where strict. \n\nBy the second one comes alone we have learned not everything is the end of the world. We have learned by our mistakes(thinks to the first). So they have a slightly easier life. We are human. \n\n\nBut given this is your third. You had her 9/12 years after the older two. You know this is your last. Well we tend to baby those kids more. We let them by with a lot more then the other 2. At this point if they are not bleeding. Haven\u2019t killed anything. And are not committing armed robbery. We are tired. We are just trying to make it through to the y turn 18. With out causing permanent trauma. \n\nIs this us making them our golden child. It can cross the line into that territory before we realize it. \n\nAt this age in your life. Your probably more financially stable. So it\u2019s easier to tell her yes where the other 2 probably heard a lot of No. financial situations change. So i can see why they think you have a golden child.\n\nI tell everyone the true test no one is the golden child if you ask your kids and each name the other kid or the other siblings and no one can name the same siblings then no one is the golden child.

It's not particularly mature to be wanting to have equal treatment with a child that is 12 years your junior.

That would've been the age where they would've been able to help out and take care of a baby and that led to resentment of what they are seeing the 10 year old do now...

Every parent eases off with the strictness as they have more kids. Part of it is because you learn it's better to be less strict, and part of it is growing complacent.\n\nYou are right that punishments should fit the context of the situation, which does include taking the child's age as a factor, but you should take your son's concerns seriously and talk to him about this. He should know that being made to pay back the cost of a broken vase is not just a punishment, it's also a lesson in learning to be conscientious and respectful of other people's things, in learning that actions have consequences (and also something he, as an adult, will be required to do, sometimes by law, so at what age exactly are you supposed to teach that?), but it's also something a toddler simply cannot do, so expecting it would be ridiculous.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A toddler can't hold down a job and pay some one back for something, a time out is a perfect punishment for a toddler. Of course you use different punishments for a toddler vs a teenager, now a child vs an adult. \n\nNow, maybe there was a difference in upbringing that these two are having, but a lot can contribute to that. A change in financial security, the parent learns what works vs what doesn't, the child is different and requires different punishments that are more suited to their personality. \n\nTelling a shy and anxious person that they aren't allowed to go to parties won't have the same effect it will have on a person who thrives in that situation.

My sister (the eldest) had stricter bed times and curfews than I (the youngest). Just tell him that and that also parents care less the more children they have because they know the 1st one is the best of what they can offer as a parent.", "Op commented the the son was 17 when he broke it", "The fact that the son was also 17 when he broke it, and complains that the punishment was unfair is a joke.", "Op commented that punishments have never changed,", "The part about breaking the vase and his punishment was unfair made me laugh when I saw that he was 17 when he did it.", "Well, it never said the age at which the older kid broke the vase and got grounded.  Just the toddler got a time out for breaking a vase. \n\nAlso, even if there's a 12 year difference and the older kid was a toddler when they broke the vase the mother would most assuredly still have had different reactions to the situation because of the time to grow up/older.\n\nParenting changes over time and tends to get less strict or abrupt in response. \n\nSo it's not a leap at all to assume there was a disparity just because no one is consistent between kids.", "You are *so* NTA here. Had a cousin who was 12 years older than her younger sister, and she would constantly call the child a \"brat\". \n\nI mean, I get sibling rivalry and all, but *12 fucking years*? \n\nI'm sorry, I would have a tough time not laughing, either!", "NAH, just a kid who doesn't get it.\n\nMy sister will swear that I was spoiled, when the reality is that A) there was a ten year age difference and B) I legitimately did not do the things she did that got her in trouble.\n\nThen again, she turned out to be violently abusive of her kids so in the end her opinion of me is worth less than nothing.", "From your post and all your comments, it seems like you\u2019d only be the a**hole for laughing. \n\nI still have a feeling your son is onto something and you left out important details. I\u2019m almost certain it is true your daughter is the golden child, since it just makes sense to any third person viewer. Youngest, female, you as a parent had time to learn, etc.", "How is this at all top comment? Yes,Op laughed in the beginning because they thought their son was joking,BUT stopped and did listen. The son then went on to describe the one time when he was a teenager and Op didn't punish a toddler in the same way,which I would have laughed at,because how ridiculous. No one in their right mind would punish a 1-3 year old the same as their teenager,nor would someone in their 20's  who wasn't looking for a fight. If son had a real argument,that would be different,but if that's the best they got,they were spoiling for a fight.", "Hahaha my husband and his siblings have spent their whole lives insisting that they are the favorite. My MIL has refused any notion that she has a favorite. Recently the last kid got married. When asked who\u2019s wedding she liked the best she just went \u201cwell my favorite child\u2019s of course!\u201d", "I have four siblings, and all of us have named a different one", "When my grandmother died, all of my cousins got in a lighthearted argument (which to this day is still going on) about how we were the favorite grandkid. This is how we know what a truly great grandma she was. Everyone should think that. It means she treated us equally and with so much love none of us knows what it would feel like to not be loved like that by her.\n\nJust so it's clear.  It's me. It's always been me.", "I was the oldest and still got hand me downs. I had cousins. If we\u2019re being honest, past kindergarten, I still got hand me downs. The baby got very few. She had expensive taste, so we had to buy her the brand name jeans and stuff. I got in trouble for \u201cbeing mean\u201d to the baby because she literally was strangling one of my friends and we yelled at her to stop. I was the good student, the helpful child, the one who did their best to never be a problem. And still she was the golden child. \n\nI got a car the Christmas I was 18, because my cousin had an old car he gave to my dad to fix up for me as a joint present. I did get a replacement car when that one was totaled. But my parents gave her a newer and nicer car, and have had to buy/help her buy several since then. \n\nSo there could be more and the baby could definitely just be spoiled."]}
