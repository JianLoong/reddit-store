Do literally every single one of his examples follow the flawed logic of punishing a toddler the same way as a teenager? Or have you left something out that would leave people not feeling as eager to back up your perspective of the situation?\n\nUltimately my only judgement can be INFO as in not enough information to make a proper judgement here. \n\nThe only advice I can give is don't laugh in your kid's face if you want to actually understand what they're feeling and why they're feeling it. That's basic common sense. And if you aren't aware of even that and thought your conduct was totally fine here, safe to say there's been more going on that you're not writing out here.", "I am guessing you where a younger mom when the oldest was born. That oldest child does have different consequences. We are all guilty. As a first time mom we are learning how to parent this little person. \n\nMost of us are not use to having small children so we where strict. \n\nBy the second one comes alone we have learned not everything is the end of the world. We have learned by our mistakes(thinks to the first). So they have a slightly easier life. We are human. \n\n\nBut given this is your third. You had her 9/12 years after the older two. You know this is your last. Well we tend to baby those kids more. We let them by with a lot more then the other 2. At this point if they are not bleeding. Haven\u2019t killed anything. And are not committing armed robbery. We are tired. We are just trying to make it through to the y turn 18. With out causing permanent trauma. \n\nIs this us making them our golden child. It can cross the line into that territory before we realize it. \n\nAt this age in your life. Your probably more financially stable. So it\u2019s easier to tell her yes where the other 2 probably heard a lot of No. financial situations change. So i can see why they think you have a golden child.\n\nI tell everyone the true test no one is the golden child if you ask your kids and each name the other kid or the other siblings and no one can name the same siblings then no one is the golden child. But my guess is she is your golden child because she is the baby. It\u2019s hard to not be as stern with her as you are the others.", "There is a lot more than this I want to hear the son's side. I'm a mom of 3 kids and when my oldest sees when his sister faces repercussions for her actions, he'll chuckle and say how he remembers the time he did that and went through that. Then again we aren't spanking parents we let our kids discover natural consequences and point out how they were warned but hey we all make mistakes.", "INFO: So when your oldest was a toddler, what would have been their punishment for the same action? When your oldest was the same age as your youngest, was their punishment for not eating their vegetables also not getting desert, or was it something different?", "YTA- If your kid is telling you something that seriously matters to them, laughing isn't the answer. If they genuinely feel like they haven't been treated fairly, you need to put your ego in the closet and listen objectively. The kid may not be right, but you don't know because you shut them down.", "I'll be honest, I think you need to revisit this post because it's pretty hard to understand the way it reads now.  But, if you're saying you should have just laughed when your oldest son said your daughter is getting preferential treatment: well, maybe.  It's important not to devalue the guy or make him feel Iike you think he has no right to be heard.  But, yea, no.  It's not particularly mature to be wanting to have equal treatment with a child that is 12 years your junior.  If for no outer reason than that you have 12 more years of parenting experience now than you did then.  I'd point out that it's not particularly dignified to be jealous of a little girl and that you were then, as you are now, doing the best you knew how.", "NTA -the way I've disciplined my kids have changed as they've grown older. Makes sense- time out for toddlers... evolving into don't eat dinner, don't get dessert... break a vase/pay for it. Given the age difference between the first two and the youngest- I wonder if it's more how the the oldest felt when the youngest was born. That would've been the age where they would've been able to help out and take care of a baby and that led to resentment of what they are seeing the 10 year old do now... I\"m just guessing, i have no idea. But if your oldest is serious about being upset- that seems to be the more important issue to breakdown", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t have laughed- laughing at your kid when they\u2019re thing to express their emotions is a great way to completely alienate them and make them feel even LESS heard. Your kid is trying to express something to you- you should dig deeper and find out why, not laugh. Yes, punishments will vary by age, and logically your oldest knows this, so you need to listen and ask questions and find out what is really bothering them. If you laugh at their emotions, they\u2019ll never trust you.", "Gentle YTA. Your child was expressing himself and airing out a frustration of his, and you laughed.", "YTA, for the bad narration alone.", "Listen to your eldest.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for parents to treat their children differently.\n\nFirst child has to deal with all the parenting mistakes. All the harsher punishments, etc.\n\nMiddle child will get it easier. \n\nYoungest child will be treated the easiest because you, as a parent have mellowed. You\u2019ve learned things aren\u2019t nearly as big a deal as you thought when you had your first.\n\nAs I said, listen to him. Don\u2019t dismiss his concerns. But do explain to him that it\u2019s not that your youngest is the golden child, it\u2019s just that your eldest got \u2018parent version 1\u2019 and it was very rough around the edges.", "YTA. sounds like you know your princess daughter is getting special treatment and don\u2019t want to own up to it. You even dismiss his feelings by calling the idea of posting ridiculous. \n\nDo some self-inventory and you\u2019ll probably discover a mountain of ways you\u2019re treating your daughter with white glove service while your two older boys were probably told to \u201csuck it up, act like a man\u201d.", "YTA", "As someone who is the oldest of four kids I can almost guarantee you're are treating the youngest more softly then you treated the oldest. I don't think you are doing it on purpose and I doubt you even notice it. This is a conversation I've constantly had with oldest children\n\nYTA for being so dismissive of his feelings. I bet if you sit and think you'll realize the difference.\nOlder kids get in trouble because of something dealing with the younger kids and the answer is always \"well you're older you should know better\" or \"they're just a baby let them have it\". There is just an unconscious bias for the youngest kids. Edited.", "Golden Child syndrome is a little silly sounding. The punishment was not. NAH", "This is a bit of both for me, but because you thought it was a joke it's definitely a NTA. \n\nWhile punishments won't always match up with children, I do feel that as parents we should try and remain fairly consistent. As an oldest child myself I could always point out the times my parents had been way harsher on me as a child than they ever were on my younger siblings so I get where Sam is coming from but as a parent I also understand your response. \n\nBrushing off his anger because of their age difference definitely wouldn't have helped the situation (my mum did the same and it infuriated me). Now that I'm a parent myself I do recognise that it's a lot of trial and error and that the oldest child is often something of a test subject while you find your feet and figure out what works and what doesn't. I'm not sure I could have ever understood that entirely before I had my own kids. \n\nImo the best thing to have done once you realised he wasn't joking would have been to, first, apologise for laughing and explain why you had. Then, second to explain that it wasn't an intentional shift in punishments for a \"golden child\" but that as a parent you had evolved in how you react to situations and that he had been a big part of that.", "NTA\n\nYou laughed because you thought he was joking. Maybe you could apologize for that aspect of it, but it's not like you were purposefully mocking him.\n\nFrom what you've posted here, it does not sound like a golden child situation. Every parent eases off with the strictness as they have more kids. Part of it is because you learn it's better to be less strict, and part of it is growing complacent.\n\nYou are right that punishments should fit the context of the situation, which does include taking the child's age as a factor, but you should take your son's concerns seriously and talk to him about this. He should know that being made to pay back the cost of a broken vase is not just a punishment, it's also a lesson in learning to be conscientious and respectful of other people's things, in learning that actions have consequences (and also something he, as an adult, will be required to do, sometimes by law, so at what age exactly are you supposed to teach that?), but it's also something a toddler simply cannot do, so expecting it would be ridiculous.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
