I've been with one for 16 years and the other for 9 years. Neither ever farts in front of me, if they can avoid it, because I cannot handle it. My nose and taste buds are very sensitive, and so are my sensibilities. They accept that.

We certainly aren't doing it in the kitchen when possible.\n\nThey don't mind if I pass gas occasionally, but I still ask them if it's okay before I ever do it on purpose. If one of us is really gassy, we don't share a room at night and give each other space during the day. We COMPROMISE based on what the other is comfortable with because our partner's feelings matter to us.\n\nThink of it this way, would you just get over him making you uncomfortable and constantly doing something that upsets you and makes you unhappy just because he feels entitled to do it around you? Probably not.\n\nYou are dismissive of his feelings and needs, and so he seems to be dismissive back. This relationship dynamic sucks. ESH. If farting everywhere is so much more important than your husband, then find a man who loves to sniff farts all day.

Fun times! \ud83d\ude02", "NTA\n\nTell him that if it's unladylike for you to fart in front of him, he needs to not fart in front you, because it's unbecoming of a distinguished gentleman. As a man, all of his farts should now be taken outside, so as not to offend the dainty senses of the lady of the house.\n\nETA: if he's disgusted by just a fart, wait till he hears about how some of our farts bubble forward through our front bits instead of just directly out our arses.", "NTA. Farting is necessary to release internal pressure.", "NTA, you can\u2019t always control bodily functions. Your partner needs to take the stick out of his butt!", "NTA because it happens .   I am of the type of person who does not in front of my husband.   Idc , it just bothers me.   I can't and try not to around him. \n\nI'm not sure how many issues I have as well.  I do know reddit opinion is no farts is one . \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Here is my take, after being with my wife for over 20 years, and we're in our 40's.\n\nI'll start by saying my wife still gets embarrassed if she farts around me, and still warns me when she has to go poop so that I don't go in right after and smell her funk lol.\n\nI on the other hand, will let it rip as I please. Hot day, in a hot car, I'll quickly lock the window controls, switch the AC to full heat, and let it rip. She will get mad but at the same time start busting up laughing. We can be in bed, and I'll let it rip right next to her, the funk wafting over the blankets then I'll quickly trap it and dutch oven her. Again, she gets mad but start laughing because I'm laughing. One thing I know that really upsets her, and I won't do unless under very specific circumstances that will allow me to get away with it (i.e., birthdays), is rub up against her and fart directly on her with skin contact lol. This will really make her mad and she will not laugh.\n\nThere are times when I know she won't think it's funny. Maybe she is in a bad mood, or had a rough day, or is just tired and wants to be left alone in peace and not smell my ass funk. I know when I can and can't joke with her with my flatulence. The other day she was having a bad day at work, we came home around the same time and before we got changed out of our work uniforms, I quickly jumped on the bed and quickly told her to pull my finger...she laughed but hesitated, because she knew...after some pestering, she finally relented and pulled the finger, one of the loudest rips in the last few months was released. We both could not stop laughing for a good 5 minutes, then she said \"ahhh, oh boy, I needed that\". It turned her rough day into a good time as we laughed together. I actually took a chance at her being upset, but she also knows I'm a joker, so I risked it to try and lighten her mood and it worked. I have probably heard her fart once in public because she couldn't hold it in, and another time she did a silent but deadly while shopping at JC Penney. The only other times I hear her fart are the natural ones she lets go while sleeping and unable to control.\n\nYour partner might not find it all that amusing. Yes, it's a natural bodily function. So is pissing, spitting, and shitting. No one wants to be around those things, and someone like your boyfriend might be a bit more conservative about farts and place it in the same category. We all have our weird quirks and preferences. Again, I know when my wife would get really upset about an untimely fart, so I know (usually) when I can and can't get away with it. I'll happily take myself to another room and let it rip when I know she isn't in the mood to deal with it. Or sometimes I just don't want to make her have to deal with it or listen to it, so I do it in private. I don't blame your partner for being annoyed if you're doing it a lot when he is a bit more conservative about it. Is it worth risking your relationship over it? Only you can decide that. Are you ok with having to forever do this specific bodily function in private? If not, you two are not compatible and you should move on. But if you can see how not everyone appreciates the dark humor of flatulence and are ok with taking into the bathroom with the rest of the other bodily functions, then maybe you'll be ok.\n\nYou and your partner are NTA, just different when it comes to certain things. I get annoyed when my wife burps really loud, I don't think it's 'ladylike', but I also wouldn't make a big deal about it. I did marry a tomboy after all lol. She knows I'm not a fan of her burps, so just like my farting, she knows when I will laugh about it or jokingly scold her about not being a lady.\n\nAll that said, if you guys are in a big argument over it, you might not be compatible. Especially if you aren't purposefully farting around him, aiming at him, or some other non 'lady-like' situations lol. But if he can't take a joke, or thinks you can never ever let one go on accident around him, you need to take your farts and move on and find someone who will appreciate you and your farts for their true worth.", "NTA - I mean, unless you Dutch oven him under the covers when he's half asleep.

So it was just a shitty time. \ud83d\ude02", "44 years, never seen it or been seen, unless accidentally opening the bathroom door, and we only had one bathroom until recently!", "So thick you gotta chew it first.", "I made the mistake of opening this thread on a train and am now trying to cry laugh silently \ud83d\ude05", "The Sneeze/fart combo is another good one. That was the first time i farted infront of my current partner and he absolutely lost it. Said that it was a first to hear such a combo. also OP NTA!!", "I laughed so hard Isnorted, thank you for sharing.", "That reminds me of the time I let one rip in bed and the stench woke my future wife up out of a dead sleep. We just celebrated our 11th anniversary yesterday.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 This is precious and amazing", "I can\u2019t stop laughing.", "The fart gave him the boost he needed to get back on the bed.", "Fartenheimer \ud83e\udd2f \ud83d\udca3 \ud83d\ude06", "My Grampy used to say \"what'd you say, Mickey?\"... Which was his cat \ud83e\udd23 I love and miss him \ud83d\udc9c", "lol I pictured Homer disappearing into the shrubs \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "My beagle will do that and then try to accuse me!!  Nuh uh girlfriend, it was all you\ud83d\ude02", "I was kind of half-asleep on the couch the other day and my cat, who was  loafing on the floor, farted. Loudly. I jumped up because I thought maybe she was sick and had pooped on the living room floor, but no. Just a fart.", "when my kitty was a baby, I was bottle feeding him and after i finished, I burped him and set him down. I went on my phone to take a cute lil video of him, well- he crawled over to his litterbox and created a crime scene. I didn't think such thunder could come from a teeny baby kitty LOL and I got in on video xD", "Once my husband and I were talking in the kitchen, the cat sat on the floor between us and let out the wettest, most reverberating fart.  We were shook.", "I\u2019m the minority in saying this but ESH. He\u2019s TA for saying it\u2019s not ladylike which is super misogynistic. YTA for pretending that everyone wants to smell your farts because it\u2019s natural? I don\u2019t like when people use that logic to fart around others. Farting is offensive because they smell like poop. Idk why this would be the hill you want to die on in your relationship. While I can believe that you\u2019re not purposefully pushing them out, I also believe you could easily excuse yourself from the room to fart if he is one of the people who don\u2019t want farting around him.", "I\u2019m now picturing trying to put that in a dating profile. \u201cLooking for someone to share farts with. But not in a sexual way. To be clear, I mean we should be able to comfortable farting in front of each other without judgment, but not like purposely trying to fart and it\u2019s definitely not a kink. Also, I like\u201d oh crap, I\u2019m out of characters for the rest of my personality.", "havent heard pooticles before, its sharticles in my house \ud83d\ude02", "Finally something reasonable. People keep commenting like its all or nothing. Either you must excuse yourself to the restroom for every single fart no matter what, or it has to be a ripping ass free for all.\n\nNormal people are like you. Try to minimize the farting in front of others. Its not the end of the world if it happens, so don't get bent out of shape over a fart. but it is polite to not just let it rip whenever.", "After dating my partner for 6 months, he farted very loudly in bed and yelled \u201cHappy 6 month anniversary!\u201d We both laughed so hard that I accidentally farted. We\u2019re married now.", "After my husband saw me give birth we mutually agreed I couldn\u2019t do anything grosser than that. That\u2019s when I stopped worrying about accidentally farting \ud83d\ude02", "We never hid ours, I guess we never had a honeymoon, even if I still get butterflies thinking about him after 5 years of being together \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "Lol, took me a minute, but your dad is my kind of guy.", "This is about our only stipulation!! Not while I\u2019m eating please. \n\nOP needs a man who yells \u2018press and seal!!\u2019 and proceeds to tuck her into her blanket like a burrito while she giggles so hard she farts again. Not\u2026like that ever happens nightly around here or anything\u2026 \n\nI will say (as someone with IBD) I have, um, had one come out in the *worst* possible time \ud83d\ude2c and my husband has paused and said \u2018you just roasted my chestnuts\u2019. I still cry laughing thinking about it.", "Feel like I had to scroll through way too many comments to get here.\n\n\"I don't want to smell your rancid assblasts while I'm cooking/eating in the kitchen,\" isn't exactly an unreasonable opinion.\n\nPeople are assuming a double standard when we don't know one actually exists and using one phrase to declare he's the biggest misogynist who ever existed when we know literally nothing about this guy other than he thinks it's rude to make someone else inhale your toxic fumes.", "LOL that's good. I'll save that.", "hahaha, I call farts butt tuba's lol!!!", "Wife's grandfather never farted in front of anyone EVER. But every night he would go up and take a bath, and the bath tub was directly above the family room. So while the whole family sat there watching TV grandpa could be heard distilling methane in the tub water for an hour \"blub blub blub\" above their heads", "I am literally laughing just reading this.", "I love it so much \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I\u2019ve never seen it in person, it reminds me of Jerry on Parks & Rec \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "LOLLLLL When my child was young we called them \"froggies.\" LOL", "I am picturing your husband as a Slitheen from Doctor Who lol", "I can't stop laughing at this mental image", "Unrelenting Force...  priceless \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "We blame the dog.

Farts are funny.", "My mom was always asking where the duck was, lol", "Barking tree spiders at our house.", "My dad always said this, and I didn't understand that he was pretending to blame a spider that barked. I just thought it was the phrase he said when he farted, instead of \"excuse me\" till I was probably 12 or 13.", "Are you my kid? My ex husband uses that term lol", "My dad's was the neighbors motorcycle", "My Husband once spent half a day with a toad in his boot. I can\u2019t comprehend how he made it that long without checking to see what the lump was\u2026 we still have toads that hang out around our outdoor shoe bench, and I tease my Husband about checking his shoes before putting them on AT LEAST once a week \ud83d\ude02\n\nPoor little toad though \ud83d\ude2d"]}
