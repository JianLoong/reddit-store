I've been with one for 16 years and the other for 9 years. Neither ever farts in front of me, if they can avoid it, because I cannot handle it. My nose and taste buds are very sensitive, and so are my sensibilities. They accept that.

We certainly aren't doing it in the kitchen when possible.\n\nThey don't mind if I pass gas occasionally, but I still ask them if it's okay before I ever do it on purpose. If one of us is really gassy, we don't share a room at night and give each other space during the day. We COMPROMISE based on what the other is comfortable with because our partner's feelings matter to us.\n\nThink of it this way, would you just get over him making you uncomfortable and constantly doing something that upsets you and makes you unhappy just because he feels entitled to do it around you? Probably not.\n\nYou are dismissive of his feelings and needs, and so he seems to be dismissive back. This relationship dynamic sucks. ESH. If farting everywhere is so much more important than your husband, then find a man who loves to sniff farts all day.
