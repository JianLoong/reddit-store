What does you working from home have to do with this, why is that the title? The situation From the way it\u2019s written it sounds like you\u2019re considering kicking them out over a single incident where she took a nap and entrusted the baby to her 13yo, who I think is old enough to babysit.

It should be in writing what exactly they're doing in exchange for living there if they're not paying rent. \n\nSpeaking very generally (and depending on where you live), it's possible to argue legally that if one side to a contract isn't enforcing the terms (i.e. lease says you pay a fee if you pay late, but the fee gets waived every time), they can't then enforce that term later on (i.e. you haven't made me pay the late fee for ten months, you can't tell me now to pay it or the contract is over). \n\nThat's not legal advice for your situation, but be prepared to seek out legal advice if you haven't already to make sure you're in the clear legally if you need to rely on the lease to evict them.", "Going against the majority it looks like, but...\n\nINFO: how long has it been since they were evicted? How is your SIL's mental health?\n\nIf they were recently evicted, that is a huge blow. It's entirely possible your SIL is struggling with depression, which may be untreated. I know when I've had depressive episodes, naps are one of my big coping mechanisms. Her son is 13, and she may we'll have expected him to come to her if he needed help -- he's getting babysitting experience, she's getting a moment for self care when she is struggling and unexpectedly watching a nibling. \n\nIf they are unemployed and drowning in debt, then told you are going to start enforcing rent unexpectedly -- did you tell them this was a possibility, or was it just in the lease? Did you talk about a timeline or conditions? If they were expecting not to pay rent, are they even in a position to start, or is this going to be a major setback? How long is the lease for, and what are the terms to break it?\n\nBased on what you've said, I worry that you offered struggling family help in their time of need, then withdrew it essentially while having them trapped in a lease and unexpectedly charging them money they can't afford when they are already stressed, depressed and out of options.", "Question\u2026is there an end date on the lease? A rent payment? I would not mind helping out a family member/s in need. But for me, it would have to be a limited time offer. NTA at all.", "Lol just kick them out and be done with it.

It's not like he could skip out on diapers if his hypothetical child is a girl", "ESH. Sister shouldn\u2019t have agreed to watch your kid and then taken a nap, and you should have set up a clearer set of expectations in the first place. You\u2019ve been letting them live there months not paying their lease or helping, and you\u2019re just now threatening to evict them over a small incident? \n\nThis could have been communicated way better, and I don\u2019t see why your post is so focused on one small thing. How is that them not respecting your WFH? Just tell the teen next time you\u2019re busy working and close the door; they didn\u2019t know better.", "Going to go against the grain and give this a mild YTA because of the way you\u2019ve handled it. I think a lot of the NTA responses are making stereotypical assumptions about people in these situations being entitled freeloaders. While this is all too often the case, I\u2019m not seeing that as necessarily true here. \n\nIt sounds like you made them sign a written lease but immediately acted inconsistently with what the lease terms were. And your expectations for whatever it is that you wanted in return for housing this family were not clearly expressed on the front end, but the breach of those expectations were dealt with in an overly heavy handed manner on the back end. That\u2019s the definition of passive-aggressive; it\u2019s poor communication and AH-ish. \n\nIf you wanted her to pay rent you should have made her pay rent. If you wanted her to work off the equivalent of rent with unpaid labor you should have been clear about that too. But instead you let her think she was in good stead. You asked a favor - which she agreed to do - and then brought up rent or added work obligations as punishment for a slight misstep. \n\nAnd it was a slight misstep, although you\u2019ve demonized her for it. You lead off with their disturbance of your work (which I 100% agree is important and should be respected). But then it appears that they live in separate space and that there seems to have been a single instance of a 13 year old kid interrupting you with no suggestion from you that the kid has ever been cautioned in advance that you are not to be disturbed when working except in case of dire emergency. I don\u2019t fault the kid for making the wrong call when thinking \u201cshould I wake my mom to do this or should I bring the baby to her mom who is already awake?\u201d He\u2019d know to do differently next time but give the poor kid a break. \n\nYour other complaint seems to be delegation of the babysitting responsibility by your SIL. You asked her to babysit and she agreed. If I agreed to babysit for a full 8 hour day and I had teenagers at home I might very well ask my teenage kid to look after the kid for a part of that time while I took a break and did other things. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with her letting her son babysit for part of that time especially given that she was still on the premises. It\u2019s unfortunate that he didn\u2019t just wake her up rather than bother you, but again, he didn\u2019t know that this would be such a big deal to you. If you don\u2019t want her letting her kids do some of the watching at all, you can tell her that now and  she can do that in the future, but you are amplifying this up into more of an egregious sin than it was. \n\nAnd sure, I know she was napping and to you that means she\u2019s lazy. I won\u2019t bother to get into the fact that there are people like me that often need a nap during the day due to medical conditions. I\u2019ll just say that even paid sitters often get opportunities for breaks during lengthy babysitting shifts when kids are napping or engaged in quiet activities that require little direct engagement, and this is perfectly fine. They get to eat, go to the bathroom and take a little time for themselves like other employees do so long as they don\u2019t abandon the child or leave them in unsafe conditions. In this case, break time can be used to nap safely \u2014 even though the kid babysitter wrongly interrupted you for the diaper change, your baby was being adequately cared for (as evidenced by his recognition of the need for the diaper change and his attempt to handle it the way he thought best in the moment) and wasn\u2019t in any danger. \n\nThe only other thing your sister did was complain about you moving the goalposts on her when you had the \u201cpay rent, work, or leave\u201d conversation. I don\u2019t blame her for expressing this view. She\u2019s been given very mixed messages. You\u2019re well within your right to take that position, but should have either made it clear right up front. And when you didn\u2019t, you could have just said more kindly, \u201chey, we need to talk about what happened and clarify our expectations going forward.\u201d But instead you used the never before enforced lease as a cudgel to punish her for her \u201ctransgressions.\u201d That\u2019s not nice behavior from a landlord, let alone a family member.\n\nEDIT: my comments about it being okay for your SIL to express how she feels about the goalposts being moved doesn\u2019t mean I think she gets to complain about you insisting on payment/labor going forward. That is your right even if you didn\u2019t ask it before. It just means I think it\u2019s fair for her to think you should have communicated it clearly up front and not act like she\u2019s somehow at fault for not reading your mind in light of unclear expectations. \n\nEdit also to add: your very title accuses the whole family of \u201cnot understanding what work at home\u201d means. I came here expecting to find that there had been a repeated disregard of your work day with interruptions, noise or demands. Not a single incident by a teenaged kid who accidentally put his foot in it. I feel so bad for this kid especially when he comes home and finds out his aunt is threatening his entire family\u2019s living situation over his relatively small little error in judgment. YTA especially for failing to consider how this could impact your nephew.

This is not a \"horror story\").\n\nHaving been in a situation where property was rented to a family member and a lease was put into place knowing they likely wouldn't keep up with the rent, the lease does offer protections to both parties and is a good idea in these family situations where you know the people aren't necessarily the most reliable. In our case, she did miss months and we did formally notify her of her past due rent and that we could evict, but didn't follow through on that until a few months later when she just randomly quit her job and we had another person interested in renting. She knew she didn't have a leg to stand on and moved out quickly and without fuss because all the bases were covered. \n\nA lease will also lay out rules that the people living there must follow. Op said she did this because of horror stories she's read on reddit, not necessarily this is a horror story. I don't blame her. Having the lease means that sil can't just go tearing down walls or painting everything black and claim she didn't know it wasn't okay because it would be spelled out in the lease. Op doesn't seem ignorant of the law, but you seem stuck on the fact that op signed a lease and didn't hound her tenants for payment. \n\n> Did her SIL breach her LL-tenant contract? No.  \n\nYes, she did. The lease stated they would pay a set rental amount and they didn't. Full stop. What else is that but a breach of contract? \n\n>Did her SIL put her baby in some jeopardy?  No.  Was it that annoying that the nephew knocked on the door and needed help for 1 minute?  No.\n\nApparently it was because op felt the need to sit down and hash out the rules going forward. Op is literally funding their unemployed lifestyle and providing them a full place to live with enough space for them and their 2 kids. Who knows how long they've been there or if other issues have come up. Op is allowed to be annoyed at having her workday interrupted when she specifically asked for help and they agreed to give it. OPs job is how they are able to support these family members. I would be annoyed too if I specifically told someone not to interrupt me while I'm working and I was interrupted anyway for a non emergency.\n\nYou keep bringing up all the landlord stuff but ignoring the fact that the sil did in fact break their lease by not paying for it. It's perfectly reasonable for op to say, ok, if you want to be treated like tenants, we can do that."]}
