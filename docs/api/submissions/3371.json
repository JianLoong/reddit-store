Don\u2019t think she\u2019s looking to be the victim but rather might be feeling a bit insecure and is looking for some reassurance. I understand self depreciation can get tedious though, so maybe have a talk with her about it and encourage her to feel more comfortable with her weight. There\u2019s nothing wrong with gaining a bit of weight but there is certainly a lot of societal pressure and standards around gaining weight (particularly for women) that she might be struggling with", "NTA - okay so here's something my boyfriend said to me once in a similar situation that worked in my case:\n\nFor background, I had a history of fitness & dieting, like your girlfriend, and had put on about 15 lbs and was uncomfortable and aware of it. \n\nAfter hearing me complain for the umpteenth-time he said look - I don't care about your weight but either do something about it or stop talking about it.  Me: ^*blink*\n\nThen I got my shit together and lost the weight but for some reason that was a reasonable wake-up call.", "NTA, tell her you won\u2019t get involved and stick with it and if she comes after you, she\u2019s not you person. You can\u2019t win that game, don\u2019t play.", "Having been on both sides of this, I\u2019m gonna say NAH.\n\nShe may *actually* be (consciously or not) wanting you to tell her she\u2019s beautiful no matter what her weight because she\u2019s feeling \u201cfat and ugly\u201d right now.  \n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s not really fair of her to pull you into her internal conflict, so of course you\u2019re going to resent it and be angry.\n\nI think this is a situation where you need to be really clear to her that you love her and think she\u2019s beautiful no matter what her weight is, but clearly *she* has issues with it, and it isn\u2019t okay for her to put you into the position of either supporting her in doing things that make her feel uncomfortable (going for the unhealthy stuff), or being the restrictive parent and telling her she needs to lose weight.  \n\nThis is *her* issue to deal with; and while you\u2019re happy to be supportive of her choices, you\u2019re not willing to be put in a no-win situation.", "ESH a little. It's never okay to tell another person how they are feeling. A more mature way to handle this situation would have been to say \"Babe, whenever you ask me weight-related questions, *I feel* like you're putting me in a no-win situation. What are you looking for when you ask those questions? Reassurance? Honesty? Help me figure out what you're looking for so I can make sure you get it.\" And then act accordingly.\n\nBut telling her \"You're trying to make yourself the victim,\" is a very harsh reading of the situation and assigns emotions to her instead of asking her what her emotions are. \n\nFor her part, these questions are rooted in her own insecurities and she needs to be more clear about what she's looking for from you in these difficult-to-navigate spots she puts you in.", "NTA. Idk, maybe turn the question back on her and ask her what she thinks about whatever given situation?", "NTA. She's trying to manipulate you into justifying decisions she knows are wrong.", "NTA.i don't know how you all are in the relationship apart from this instance and if she has gaslighted you in the past but maybe you should have an honest conversation with her if she's that worried about the weight", "NTA - as a woman I can say we do this on occasion and for some its a trap for others its a way to process and mostly rhetorical. I think if it makes you uncomfortable you should tell her that and tell her why and if she doesn't respect that then she is definitely TA and you should maybe consider leaving", "NTA. Sounds like you handled her questions skillfully. Don't let her draw you in. Let her fight this one out with herself.", "My girlfriend does this same shit and i absolutely hate it too, so i know the feeling. \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA- self-deprecating behavior is tedious. \n\nAccusing her of being a victim is a bit extreme,  you could've just left it at you felt she's trying to get you to insult her...but exhausting comments can illicit strong responses. \n\nLet her know she can involve you in more positive discussions about her body/weight if she'd like.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Those situations are tough.\n\nWe've been to the moon but can't find a way to eat sugar without getting fat? Come on science.", "NTA, but idk if she's trying to play the victim to you. it sounds like casual insecurities manifesting.", "ESH - but more you than her. Your girlfriend is feeling very insecure and is looking either for reassurance or (more sadly) for you to justify how awful she feels about herself.\n\nYou\u2019re not TA for feeling frustrated - she\u2019s fishing and it\u2019s annoying. But you are TA a bit for how you\u2019ve handled it. If you care about her and want to move forward with her, I would try clear communication WITHOUT the assumptions (ie: assuming she\u2019s trying to trap you).\n\nAddress how you feel about her (you like/love her and think she\u2019s beautiful) and that you think she\u2019s maybe feeling down on herself. Let her know that those questions are making you uncomfortable and you\u2019d rather she\u2019s just honest with you if she\u2019s feeling insecure. \n\nWhen I\u2019m feeling down on myself, I straight up tell my partner. He usually then asks me what I need - sometimes it\u2019s just that I need to talk, or I need a hug, or I need someone I love to remind me of the good things about myself.", "NTA. She wants you to deny that she's put weight on.", "YTA", "ESH. While it's valid for her to express her insecurities to you and want support, you're right that her asking you questions like that is unfair and putting you in a hard position. You can simply respond with things like \"do what you think is best\", but she's clearly looking for an answer.\n\nBut it sounds like you've never communicated that this was an issue before, and when you did, you did it in a cruel and accusatory way that attributed maliciousness to her that you don't even know was there. How do you know she's \"trying to get you to insult her\" instead of trying to get you to *reassure and validate* her? Maybe she wants you to reassure her that you're still attracted to her, you don't think less of her, you won't see her as a failure if she gets the drink she wants. She's doing it the wrong way, but maybe you're not being thoughtful and considerate enough to take the initiative on that? And yes, if you chose to insult her when presented with those questions, you would still be in the wrong. \n\nYou should have brought it up in a more healthy way - how it makes you feel uncomfortable and is an unfair thing of her to do for both of you. How you want to support her in whatever way she needs but those questions are not the right way for her to get that from you.", "NTA - Man, this some weak bs! Next time she asks you if something does make her look fat or bloated or whatever, just sit her down, look her in her eyes and say \"if a dress or some jeans make you feel like you look fat, then you are fat! There is no way around it! I don't know why you're hating yourself and trying so damn hard to drag me into this drama of yours!\"", "YTA, Why not tell her an honest answer? She asked for your opinion after all, tell her your opinion, If she doesn't take it well that's on her, saying that this is a trap question, shows lack of trust, you don't know what her intentions are and you over thought simple questions", "I feel for you. I do because this needs to be handled carefully. No matter how much you tell her you love her as she is, if she isn\u2019t feeling it then she needs to deal with it. You can talk to her and say I love you no matter what. What do you want to do to make yourself feel better? - and kinda go from there. Ask if she wants to go the gym with you, cook healthier meals etc?", "> tell her she\u2019s beautiful no matter what her weight \n\ntrue but deep inside she will know she doesn't look good for **her** standards for how **she** prefers to see herself and frankly nothing OP can say will change that\n\nI'm guessing this girl is grappling with some version of the freshman 15 and needs to come to jesus somewhere", "THIS RIGHT HERE. NTA for not wanting to answer her questions. But YTA for what you said and the way you said it. She's likely looking for reassurance, but since you've already told her that you love her as she is, tell her that you won't be entertaining any of these questions. And that your response will always be \"no opinion.\""]}
