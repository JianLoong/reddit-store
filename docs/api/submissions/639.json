{"id": 639, "submission_id": "yh7du3", "title": "AITA for telling my boyfriend that my halloween costume is no big deal?", "selftext": "So I (19F) have a bf (19M) and we've been together for three years. Tonight there was a halloween party that I wanted to attend because I rarely ever go out. I just wanted to get out and have a good time. I didn't go costume shopping, so I threw something together last minute (it's a crop top, pleated skirt, fishnets, and AF1) Its supposed to be a school girl costume but it's poorly executed. I posted a video of part of my costume and my bf flipped out. He immediate text me after viewing my story (mind you he hadn't text me for hours until he saw my post) he said \"why are you wearing that?\" I explained that it was halloween and I wanted to go out. He immediately says \"we're done\". I asked why and he refuses to give me a valid explanation. He said \"go get someone else's phone number\". I said that it was just a costume and I can wear what I want and that him leaving me over a dumb costume is childish. I also said that he has no say in what costume I pick. AITA?\n\nUpdate: \n\nNot too long after the halloween costume argument, my boyfriend harshly accuses me of cheating. He's done this several times before but this time, it felt different. He kept saying \"I know you're cheating on me\" and \"| know you're sleeping with other guys\". Mind you I haven't done anything with anyone else during our entire relationship! I've only been with him, he's all know. I was upset by this. My final straw was when he said \"either tell me the truth or we're done\". But I was telling the truth the whole time, so why would admit to doing something never did?!?! He kept getting mad because I wasn't giving him an answer he wanted to hear. l've never cheated on him ever. He then apologized and said that he reacted like that because he was high. I told him that whether he was under the influence or not, that being high wasn't an excuse for his behavior. He also said that he wasn't serious about breaking up. I told him that he should stand on what he said since he was so quick to leave me over that (keep in mind that this isn't the first time he's said \"we're done\" in a situation). Right now we're still together but honestly, I don't know what to do right now.\nShortly after, he said that he was on his way to my dorm room (about a two hour drive) and I told him that he's welcome to stop by, but I will not be engaging in any sexual activity with him. I made this decision because I was hurt by his harsh false accusations against me. He's my first boyfriend, my first everything. I shared my body with him and let him see me in ways I'd never let anyone else. So for him to not only accuse me of cheating, but to also threaten to leave me if I don't \"admit to what I did\" hurt my feelings. I told him that I wasn't going to engage in any sexual activity with him because clearly he doesn't trust me, so why would I contin to share my body with someone who can't trust me.

Not acting rational doesn't meen anyone needs to put up with those insecurities, regardless of age.\n\nSecond, 'women' because 19 is a young adult, can dress wearing what ever makes them feel good.
