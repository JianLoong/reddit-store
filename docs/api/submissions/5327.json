Its great that you have your brother on your side for moral support, make sure you show him some appreciation.", "NTA, I would prolly not talk to my mom or dad untill they realized how disgusting your brother is, or at least come to terms with that fact that you will never act like a brother to him again... It's hard for parents to take sides with their children so this happens so often that the hurt party (you) looks like the bad guy because you don't want to get along and be a family still... If I were you I would not reward your parents behavior by \"playing nice\". sometimes parents are the ones that need to be taught something.  And it's a hard lesson that one of your kids is a piece of trash.", "NTA. Why would your parents be good with what they did? You and your brother being \"family\" didn't stop him from being with your girlfriend.", "NTA. \nThis is definitely not your fault at all. Cheaters suck and good job from going no contact with them.", "NTA, what a train wreck of a situation. You're well rid of Molly and your brother both.", "NTA. He slept with your girlfriend behind your back and people think you're an ass for not going to the wedding?", "NTA they're completely unreasonable for expecting you to attend that wedding.\n\nSounds like your parents want to mend the rift in the family and you're the only one who can do that, since they can't reverse what your brother and ex did. They're likely frustrated that they couldn't have the whole family there and are taking it out on you. \n\n**Doesn't make them right to do so.** However you see yourself spending time with your family in future is up to you, and they should accept whatever boundaries you choose to lay down.", "NTA", "NTA... You cant treat family like S\\*&t and expect them to want to celebrate your new life. Keep doing you and be glad that the bullet missed you. If you never get to where you can stand to be around them, it is their problem not yours.", "Definitely NTA.", "Ask dad if he would be okay with mom cheating and getting pregnant.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nLol as a general rule, when your brother has an affair with your girlfriend, you do not then attend their wedding and wish them the best together.  You're solidly in the clear.", "NTA. What did they expect was going to happen?\n\nI wouldn't rule out going LC or NC with your parents, because if they're this reactive towards your response of , idk, being cheated on with your brother, chances are they're not gonna get any better.", "NTA", "NTA-Your brother betrayed you. There was no justification to reasonably expect you to attend the wedding.", "NTA. You\u2019re not obligated to forgive people who wrong you only because they\u2019re family.", "I am sorry Dad that I can't forgive my brother nor ex for their betrayal. \n\nMaybe you should ask them how they really met? \n\nDid they tell you they were having an affair behind my back? \n\nNo? Yes? You knew? And you're ok with that? \n\nNTA. Of course. NTA.\n\nFamily would not do that to you. \n\nGood that you have some support. Stay strong.
