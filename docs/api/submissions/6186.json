Also not nice.\n\nNow to that question of your: you are annoyed because you think your daughter is learning unnecessary stuff from her mother. Well, it's not unnecessary for your wife.

My mum was the same. I remember as a kid having to say \"white rabbit, white rabbit, white rabbit\" on the 1st of every month because it was  'White Rabbit Day'  My mum had so many of them. (she was an abusive alcoholic so superstitions were the least of her problems but that's a whole 'nother post) My mum did the washing thing as well. She caught me putting the machine on and said I'd be a murderer if one of my family died that year. I had a massive family. I was one of five siblings and my mum was one of seven kids and all my mums siblings had 3-11 kids each so really the odds of a family member dying wasn't that small. \n\nI grew up hating them. She tried to say the same things to my daughter when she was little. I would just laugh and say. \"Grandmas being silly again\" and I explained to my daughter that some people believed silly things and it was okay for that person to believe them if that was their choice, but she (daughter) didn't have to believe.\n\nYour wife is the AH for blowing up at you.

Loads of my family (UK) are superstitious- just do what we do, make up your own. Tell her you're washing IN your luck for the year.

It was just fun tbh.", "I never leave my own comments but is this superstition or (untreated) OCD?", "Damn. That's difficult. It sounds like she really believes those superstitions not just something fun to sometimes follow. But it also sounds like you always knew she had those beliefs. I'm leaning YTA because of how you spoke with her and that you married and had a kid with her when you knew this going in. You could have sat her down and discussed this instead of ignoring, yelling, and cutting her out of a parenting discussion. It sucks because it seems crazy but I guess you should treat it like any other couple disagreeing about how to raise kids in their belief system like religion or cultural traditions.\n\nEdit: so apparently the laundry on NYE is pretty big on the superstition list. So if she believes in superstition, it's like you just tried to kill a family member?", "NTA.\n\nWhen I read your comment about not doing a wash on New Year's Day, my first thought was in that case why did your wife not stick a load in the machine last night so it was done before midnight. \n\nHonestly, I had to look this one up. Apparently there are a few variants including washing a loved one away, washing your luck away, or meaning you will be doing even more washing for the rest of the year ([https://inthewash.co.uk/laundry-and-ironing/wash-clothes-new-years-day/](https://inthewash.co.uk/laundry-and-ironing/wash-clothes-new-years-day/)). \n\nA lot of superstitions have some logic behind them (like not walking under ladders), or have a historical reason, that has become skewed over time. The shoes, for example, can relate to a death in the family or bad luck. If they are used shoes, obviously it is unsanitary. There is also apparently a belief in the north of England it comes from that when a miner died in a colliery accident, the shoes were placed on the table as a sign of respect. \n\nThe stepping cracks in the pavement one can be a fun game for children to avoid the cracks, but when you look into the background of the superstition, the reasonings aren't nice. \n\nI think maybe both you and your wife need to do some research on the origins of the superstitions she holds to.  You might understand her position better, and your wife might realise that some are not worth keeping strictly to.\n\nBut going back to the wash load, I do hope you can get passed this disagreement over her superstitions, and it doesn't prove self-fulfilling.", "INFO Do you always call your wife stupid and disrespect her opinions? It doesn\u2019t matter that they\u2019re not important to you, but the tone of your post indicates that you don\u2019t speak to your wife or even think of her with much respect.", "YTA for the way you handled it. It's important to her. It's not off the deep end. You didn't need to insult it. I believe the not washing of clothes, not sweeping, and so on is related to Chinese traditions and possibly others. We don't do it either just because. My spouse thinks it's silly but says meh we'll do laundry tomorrow.", "YTA - clearly this stuff is nuts but you know it\u2019s important to your wife and the mother of your daughter so maybe you can be less of a jerk in the way you handle it. If it\u2019s been there all along, then you knew what you were letting yourself in for when you got married.
