It\u2019s possible these rituals mean more to her than you could know (anxiety, OCD etc.)\n\nI think it\u2019s worth exploring these superstitions with her in a genuinely kind and curious way. What about these superstitions is so important to her? Does she genuinely believe something bad will happen? Is there any way you can help her feel more secure?", "NTA but you could have been nicer about it\n\nalso, i'm not saying this is for sure what it is, but i have pretty severe OCD and some of your wife's behaviors remind me of my own. i have many \"rituals\" i tend to follow and i get extremely anxious if i cannot do them. i always feel like something terrible will happen. for example, if i don't check the deadbolt a couple of times before bed, i'm convinced i will die.\n\nagain, i am not an expert by any means, so take this with a grain of salt. could definitely be worth looking into though.", "NTA. Doing laundry might not wash people away, but smelly clothes and bad hygiene definitely will.", "NTA - This sounds horribly exhausting. But yeah, all of these are superstitions which have roots in history. Look them up. That doesn't make it OK to impose them on others though.\nHas your wife always been like this?", "NTA\n\nShe is welcome to practice her superstitions if she wants, but suggesting that you're not setting a good example for your daughter is an ah thing to say. I'd love for someone to explain how washing YOUR clothing could \"wash someone out of your life\". I could see if maybe you were washing THEIR clothes.... Or maybe if THEY gave you that shirt..... Either way, forget that nonsense.", "NAH, or maybe BTA?\nListen, you married a woman knowing how she is. And knowing she had this weird side that not everyone believes in (superstition).\n\nBut she actually does, she does believe that if you turn on that washing machine you will wash people out of your lives. So standing in your shoes, why not wait just another day? You just pressed that button out of pettyness. That's not nice.\n\nThe way she handled the situation? Also not nice.\n\nNow to that question of your: you are annoyed because you think your daughter is learning unnecessary stuff from her mother. Well, it's not unnecessary for your wife. Just like you are trying to raise your child and teaching them how the world works, she is doing just the same within her beliefs.\n\nThere's not really an ahole here, more a lack of tolerance for oneanother.", "NTA for getting annoyed, as long as you didn't yell and scream back when she blew up. \n\nThose superstitions are annoying. My mum was the same. I remember as a kid having to say \"white rabbit, white rabbit, white rabbit\" on the 1st of every month because it was  'White Rabbit Day'  My mum had so many of them. (she was an abusive alcoholic so superstitions were the least of her problems but that's a whole 'nother post) My mum did the washing thing as well. She caught me putting the machine on and said I'd be a murderer if one of my family died that year. I had a massive family. I was one of five siblings and my mum was one of seven kids and all my mums siblings had 3-11 kids each so really the odds of a family member dying wasn't that small. \n\nI grew up hating them. She tried to say the same things to my daughter when she was little. I would just laugh and say. \"Grandmas being silly again\" and I explained to my daughter that some people believed silly things and it was okay for that person to believe them if that was their choice, but she (daughter) didn't have to believe.\n\nYour wife is the AH for blowing up at you. Just make sure you reassure your daughter that those superstitions are silly.", "NTA where did she get this washing clothes superstition a cracker jack box?", "NTA, she can believe what she likes but shouldn't enforce these ridiculous things on yourself and your daughter.", "I totally get this post. Loads of my family (UK) are superstitious- just do what we do, make up your own. Tell her you're washing IN your luck for the year. If a car horn suddenly beeps, saying \"pardon me\" means not only are you hilarious, but are welcoming joy into the home for the year. If on the motorway, saluting the Eddie Stobart lorries ensures you'll have a good journey etc lol   NTA", "Nah. You could have been nicer about it but just cos they\u2019re her superstitions doesn\u2019t mean she can pass them onto you. \n\nStep on a crack, break your mothers back etc are things from my childhood that I remember we all took seriously as kids but that\u2019s cos we were kids. It was just fun tbh.", "I never leave my own comments but is this superstition or (untreated) OCD?", "Damn. That's difficult. It sounds like she really believes those superstitions not just something fun to sometimes follow. But it also sounds like you always knew she had those beliefs. I'm leaning YTA because of how you spoke with her and that you married and had a kid with her when you knew this going in. You could have sat her down and discussed this instead of ignoring, yelling, and cutting her out of a parenting discussion. It sucks because it seems crazy but I guess you should treat it like any other couple disagreeing about how to raise kids in their belief system like religion or cultural traditions.\n\nEdit: so apparently the laundry on NYE is pretty big on the superstition list. So if she believes in superstition, it's like you just tried to kill a family member?", "NTA.\n\nWhen I read your comment about not doing a wash on New Year's Day, my first thought was in that case why did your wife not stick a load in the machine last night so it was done before midnight. \n\nHonestly, I had to look this one up. Apparently there are a few variants including washing a loved one away, washing your luck away, or meaning you will be doing even more washing for the rest of the year ([https://inthewash.co.uk/laundry-and-ironing/wash-clothes-new-years-day/](https://inthewash.co.uk/laundry-and-ironing/wash-clothes-new-years-day/)). \n\nA lot of superstitions have some logic behind them (like not walking under ladders), or have a historical reason, that has become skewed over time. The shoes, for example, can relate to a death in the family or bad luck. If they are used shoes, obviously it is unsanitary. There is also apparently a belief in the north of England it comes from that when a miner died in a colliery accident, the shoes were placed on the table as a sign of respect. \n\nThe stepping cracks in the pavement one can be a fun game for children to avoid the cracks, but when you look into the background of the superstition, the reasonings aren't nice. \n\nI think maybe both you and your wife need to do some research on the origins of the superstitions she holds to.  You might understand her position better, and your wife might realise that some are not worth keeping strictly to.\n\nBut going back to the wash load, I do hope you can get passed this disagreement over her superstitions, and it doesn't prove self-fulfilling.", "INFO Do you always call your wife stupid and disrespect her opinions? It doesn\u2019t matter that they\u2019re not important to you, but the tone of your post indicates that you don\u2019t speak to your wife or even think of her with much respect.", "YTA for the way you handled it. It's important to her. It's not off the deep end. You didn't need to insult it. I believe the not washing of clothes, not sweeping, and so on is related to Chinese traditions and possibly others. We don't do it either just because. My spouse thinks it's silly but says meh we'll do laundry tomorrow.", "YTA - clearly this stuff is nuts but you know it\u2019s important to your wife and the mother of your daughter so maybe you can be less of a jerk in the way you handle it. If it\u2019s been there all along, then you knew what you were letting yourself in for when you got married.  Teach your daughter to think for herself and she\u2019ll realise pretty quickly what unmitigated tosh it is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
