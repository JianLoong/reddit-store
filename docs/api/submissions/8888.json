Every point you\u2019ve made about your in-laws is a bright red flag with danger written on it. Cutting them out completely would seemingly be no great loss, but obviously that might be more difficult for your wife than yourself.", "NTA - you\u2019re a great dad!", "Maybe I am on the internet too much, but anyone else think its a little (a lot) suspicious that the FIL is insisting so hard on leaving a one month old baby with them overnight?

My kids were almost a year old before I let them stay the night with any of their grandparents.", "NTA.  The picture you painted is that leaving a newborn alone with them is dangerous for the baby.  Don\u2019t do it!!!\n\nTBH, I wouldn\u2019t leave your son alone with them either. \n\nSmearing you on social media and dragging your parents into it is soooo inappropriate that I don\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t go LC with them.", "NTA. Even if they were responsible, clean, and caring grandparents, it's yours (and your wife's) decision where your child stays and with whom. Plus she's a month old?! That's incredibly young to be spending time away from home even with the best care-givers. If your wife agrees about not letting the in laws watch the baby by themselves (at night or during the day) that's all that matters. Your FIl is a total AH.", "NTA - how could you even think that you are an AH? You're protecting your children from being unsupervised in an unsafe environment. Your wife is behind you. And your newborn is a month old. You can't even separate puppies from their mother until their 6 weeks old. A month is too young for sleep overs to begin with. Your reasoning is absolutely sound and I would do the same thing.", "What context? A mother doesn't want to be separated from her month old kid. \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like you have legitimate safety concerns, and if they can't address that with you, it may be time to stop letting them into your life. You and your wife should keep doing what is best for your kids.", "NTA I don't care how much I trust someone, a one month old is not getting a sleepover unless I'm in the hospital, and I'd ask the hospital at least three times to let the baby in first. The fact that you have correctly identified that they wouldn't be good guardians is just frosting on the hell no cupcake.", "NTA.  One-month baby sleeping in a playpen filled with toys, dirty/nasty home, lazy and belligerent FIL, and trash-talking on FB. Well, since you asked, NO, NO, NO YANTAH.

At least your wife is on your side, that's what matters.", "NTA\nWhy the urgency", "NTA yikes I don't think I'd feel safe staying at your in-laws for a night, let alone a newborn. their environment does not sound suitable for a baby.", ">I blocked them from social media, and I am pushing to have them out of our lives entirely, including not being able to see their grandkids....My son loves them, and maybe I am letting my feelings get in the way of things?\n\nNTA for saying no to the overnight visits, of course.\n\nBut you're taking it pretty far here.  Has your wife agreed to completely cut off her own parents? And you don't have any issue doing that when you admit your son loves them?\n\nCompletely breaking relationships should be reserved for serious issues. In your case, the \"problem\" is only that you are annoyed with them---you and your wife already agree that they only have supervised visits in their home.", "Yes. This was my thought, too. It seemed pretty cut and dry to me, but I know I am 5 I despise these people. I was thinking that maybe that affected my judgement.", "A narcissist wants the authority of a king and the accountability of a toddler.  Seems like that fits here.", "I don't think I am. But I try to be open-minded. Some people think that family is everything and that grandkids shouldn't be kept from their grandparents. \n\nThere could be things I haven't considered. Or solutions I haven't thought of. \n\nApologies if you felt like your time was wasted.", "That\u2019s not a viable solution. They leave babies in wet diapers because they\u2019re lazy. They will do that at OP\u2019s house too. They drive without a license. It\u2019s entirely possible that people like this, who clearly don\u2019t recognize boundaries or behave responsibly, would decide to take OP\u2019s kids out to run errands or something. If they get arrested, again, while your kids are with them, CPS gets involved. \n\nDo not *ever* leave your kids alone with them. It is not your job to find a solution that appeases them. It\u2019s your job to keep your kids safe. This is a hill I would die on with your wife, if necessary. If she doesn\u2019t take it seriously, go to couple\u2019s therapy. This is a big deal.", "Might consider that. Maybe after things cool down.", "This except the only option is NC.", "Was looking for this comment.

But our NPL is done. We have to work. My parents are at least trustworthy and has what she needs, and they don't just leave her there.", "Well, the problem is that I want to completely cut them from our lives as a result of this. Does that make me an asshole and should I do that?", "I am really upset with how he treated my wife. Intentionally hurting her feelings or making her feel less then. \n\nMy wife hasn't agreed to this, and probably won't. She loves her parents. \n\nI am feeling pretty done with them, personally. \n\nWe agreed to supervised visits, and the in-laws, especially my FIL, are throwing a fit. They think I am giving special treatment to my parents and being unfair.", "Nah, your judgement is spot-on here. This is a power play from your FIL, pure and simple. Don't play his games.", "Not when safety is a concern. Screw every person that sides with them. They can put their children at risk.\n\n\nWhen you become a parent,  your number one job is protecting them. \n\n\nNta, but seriously, you need to discuss this with your wife of taking this further. Them putting this on social media is crossing another line. I would not them see the children at all if they continue to air their dirty laundry.", "You are not keeping your child from the grandparents. Your wife visits and lets them see the baby. They are not **safe** to leave your baby with. Your FIL is not going to help, he's going to dump the baby on your MIL. If they want to see the baby more, they can call you & your wife and make plans to get a cab or Uber to your house. \n\nIf anyone says anything about it, tell them it's your newborn child and you get to decide who they spend the night with.", "Visiting and retaining control of your newborn is the right thing to do but cutting ties should be your wife's decision. \n\nKeeping grandkids away is different than not leaving them with grandparents.", "She agrees with me. It's the cutting contact with them and keeping them out of our lives that is the major discussion.", "Your wife will have to realize they're toxic herself. Nothing you say will get her to see it.", "I see, I meant for overnights not so much for during work hours care. Regardless, the parents make these decisions and you have an overwhelming number of very valid reasons not to use the in laws for childcare.", "Until then clean up their lives, I think you should go NC. But that's not necessarily fair to your wife unless she also wants to go NC. It's your children and your wife. What would best benefit them? If NC isn't an option right now, or your wife wants to ease into it, begin going LC and see if they start to change their habits. Most of the time, the won't, but who knows? They might surprise you.", "So what if they throw a fit? Ignore it. They can see the kids at your house or your wife can decide how often she wants to visit.\n\nYour wife wants *some* relationship with her parents, clearly.  Your children are not in harm's way because you and your wife only take them over yourselves, and supervise the entire visit. \n\n--->You are annoyed, you don't like them, they suck for complaining on social media---all that is true and legit.  But the person you will be stressing the most if you continue your drama **is your own wife.**", "They are publicly disrespecting you. Posting about this on Facebook. Badmouthing you, in particular. At this point, there needs to be a time out for all of you. Including your wife. I wouldn\u2019t put a time frame on it, but one of my conditions for ending it would be an apology that\u2019s just as public as the talking shit about you was. That may never happen. But it\u2019s on them if the time out becomes a cut off. But frame it as a time out for now.", "Yeah. I absolutely do. I kept thinking my judgement was compromised.", "I definitely do not want to hurt my wife. I chose not to engage on social media, I blocked them right away. \n\nI want them out of my life because my FIL intentionally said things to hurt my wife. \n\nBut I guess it's my wife that matters. Should I push editing them out of our life or should I back whatever decision she wants to make?", "Sounds like your judgement is spot on.", "I think you both need to have a serious conversation about this and come up with a reasonable compromise. Don\u2019t make any major decisions about that until you do", "Good advice. We definitely will. Thanks."]}
