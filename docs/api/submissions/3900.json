And so is your resentment of her questions. It's not so unreasonable to think that you might have talked to your cousin in getting ready to go back and attend her wedding. Or that you might spend time with your Brother in Law and at least have an idea of his shoe size. Most of these are not questions that it would be impossible for you to know the answers to, so you come across as just a bit sullen like a teenager instead of a 38 year old.", "ESH.

In this case, I think she asks those questions because, as she says, she's just trying to make a conversation, and when she's asking you, I think she's just asking the Universe out loud.  I think your father's comments and reaction were spot on.  Most people put up with annoying habits of family members.  It practically defines what family really is...people that you are willing to overlook their negative or annoying tendencies because you truly love them.", "So you're 38 years old and haven't learned to simply say I don't know and just redirect the conversation elsewhere? \n\nYTA. Yes sometimes moms ask annoying questions. Big fucking deal. Also It's a fact of life not everyone likes tattoos. You're already aware your mom doesn't, though she still loves you because she's your mother. You can do whatever you want to your own body purposely getting another tattoo to spite her and then being surprised she's not taking it well is basically the surprised Pikachu meme.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Obviously you can get any tattoo you like. But I also wouldn\u2019t take your mom\u2019s questions as something she can necessarily control.

Lol, my mom does this too. I moved back in when my husband passed to help them out with the house because it was becoming too much for them, and for them to help me with my kids...

Or she will ask me questions about my brother who doesn't live here.", "YTA. You specifically got the tattoo to insult your mom. It's childish and messed up.", "YTA. Getting a tattoo to purposefully annoy someone is an asshole thing to do. Like you can have your reasons but it's exactly the kind of thing an asshole would justify.", "YTA\nYou knew she hates tattoos and told her you'd get one if she doesn't change. Of course she doesn't change. You can't make people change. You did this to piss her off. Very petty. Moms always ask dumb questions all the time. You just have to ignore them or move on", "Hot take I guess but, I'm leaning towards an ESH. \n\nYour mum for continuing to pester you with questions you are unable to answer. Assuming you've expressed to her how these questions aggravate you. \n\nIt's your body and you can do with it what you wish, as long as those actions only impact you. That being said, I guess I just think it's pretty immature to get a tattoo to deliberately upset your mother.", "You're NTA for getting annoyed,  By the time you've had half a dozen questions thrown at you you start to feel like a broken Alexa. But YTA to yourself for the tattoo, and a bit to your mum. Its the things she concerns herself with and her way to make conversation ( maybe gossip). Best you could do is spend less time with her. Leave gracefully before you get too annoyed.", "Yes. I have no idea why she would ask.  For example I was driving us to a mall to do some shopping and I noticed that the old Cheesecake Cafe building had been remodeled.  So I asked her when the restaurant closed. She said that it had closed a few years ago. And then she asked me if I knew who the next tenant would be. Not like she had the inside scoop.  Like she thought o might know who would be moving into a building I didn't even know was vacant until seconds before.", "Its not like I'm even listening when people do this.

She says \u201cThat\u2019s what kids are for. We ask you these things because we think you\u2019re so super smart.\u201d", "This. \n\nYou only got the tattoo to annoy her, as you know by know it's not going to stop her asking these questions.\n\nLook, I get it's annoying, but she's clearly not a great conversationalist, and is trying to find some way to show the interest she thinks she is expected to show.  She does a crappy job at it, and you've adapted to it sarcastically and confrontationally.  What happens if you, instead, offer a reply that says something else - about the same people - that you do know.  Like \"I have no idea how they met, but just look at them, they look like they are really happy to be getting married.\" Or \"Well, they got pregnant by having sex, like everyone else, but who cares because we know you love <nibling> to pieces.\"", "How his sister got pregnant?\n\nWhat school his son's friends parents went to?\n\nAnd Bil show size? \n\nThose are all absurd things to ask.", "I mean, just a quick note, but tattoos don't have to have any meaning. Sometimes they just look cool, sometimes they are funny, sometimes they have deep meaning, and sometimes they are like this, something that seems to be half joking but also sorta proving a point? It's his body anyway.", "[deleted]", "You know, the mother could avoid all of this by putting \"I wonder how...\" in front of her questions. This would signal that she is only curious about the subject; on the off-chance OP knows the answer she could tell her and if she doesn't it could end with her saying she doesn't have a clue either.\n\nFor the mother to be stuck in a thoughtless mode like some kind of machine with misaligned wiring, seriously asking and expecting answers to questions a second's thought would tell her were most likely unanswerable, is understandably grating to OP when it is done hundreds of times.\n\nI think affirming and escalating the questions would create a Pavlovian association between asking ridiculous questions and getting ridiculous answers. This is the way I would have gone.\n\nHow did the couple meet? They met at clown school -- inside a crammed clown car with 50 other clowns inside. She had to sit on his lap contorted like a tetris block. It created instant closeness.\n\nThe son's friend's parents are planning to start school next week. Better late than never, right?\n\nThe sister's pregnancy? A  certain fast food chain is run by religious fanatics who have put nanobots into everything they sell. These bots are able to interfere with most forms of birth control. There are even ones with little scissor attachments to cut holes in condoms.", "I have a pretty good idea of the shoe size for my brothers in law. It definitely isn't absurd.\n\nThe son's friend's parents' school and how sister got pregnant are further out.\n\nThe way cousin met fiance and is not absurd at all. \n\nBut even if they *were*, who cares? It's not like he said his mom gets mad at him or yells at him for not knowing the answer. She's basically just wondering out loud and it's immature for him to be so petty and rude to her as she's just trying to make conversation with her son and he's making it hard.", "Not really THAT absurd.\n\nHow the sister got pregnant? Well clearly they stopped using the BC and had it removed or it failed and well there's the baby.  \n\nWhat school the friends went too? No clue. Maybe he can converse about it with the friends parents next time they spend together. Maybe the mom just wants to know if they're locals from the area or elsewhere.\n\nBIL shoe size is absurd? Really? That's just a basic question, especially if you're potentially gifting them shoes as a presents.\n\nIt's really not hard to just answer or redirect the questions for another time.", "That's a fair point and it is his body. I'd just say it is also his mother and putting his point above his mother when the worst thing she's apparently done is ask questions that he finds annoying is kinda assholey", "Ummm, congratulations?", "Op told her it bothered them. She didn't respect that. She asked them about sister's sex life ffs. Stop blowing past that like it's irrelevant.", "If these answers are obvious (other than son's friends parents), why doesn't mom know them? Or ask the people who are likely to know?", "I guess I missed the mark.", "Who said it was irrelevant? I clearly said the mom is an AH too in my vote. It doesn't stop him from being an AH too for his immature and unkind decision to hurt  her.", "Who knows? Maybe she's too embarrassed to ask directly and would rather ask her son. Maybe there's language barriers between the mom and BIL, IDK. It's not a really a big deal. Mom just seems like the typical nosy, curious mom to me. I'm sure it's frustrating at times as all family is but OP really went out and dropped money on a small tattoo knowing she doesn't like tattoos and is now surprised she's not taking it well. LOL Come on now.", "You keep focusing on how these questions aren't that big of a deal.\n\nAnyway, grownups mention when something bothers them. Op did that. Mom didn't care.", "Why isn't Mom asking, idk, the BIL's WIFE??\n\nand where did you get the idea that OP is surprised?"]}
