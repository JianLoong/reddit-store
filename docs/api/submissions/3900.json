I really like our conversations.\" or something like that anyway.", "No idea what OPs mother is thinking. But when I was a kid my dad asked me a series of questions like this. All I remember is him finishing up with \u201cand how many times do you think you\u2019ll say \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 in this conversation\u201d\n\nAnd it still hurts. My dad was/is a bully. And if OPs mom is like that then good on him for shutting her up.", "Also OP has another tattoo idea", "I know right?! Love it. I do comedy and this is funnier than anything I\u2019ve ever written.", "No one *has to* put up with ANYTHING! That's the point. An adult asked another adult to stop doing something and said what they'd do if the other person didn't stop. So OP did the thing they explicitly said they'd do. So what she did something to HER body that her mom didn't like. Her mom was doing something to HER that she didn't like. The mom blatantly ignored the clear, and extremely reasonable, boundary that OP set. \n\nDoesn't matter if you, me, their mom, or anyone else other than OP thinks it's a rational boundary. It's theirs to have and we, this means *everyone* they may ever encounter in life, can either respect the boundaries set by OP, and any other people we may cross paths with, or deal with the consequences of not doing so. If that means they do something, to themselves(!!!) that other people don't like; so be it. If it means cutting people off; byyyeeee. \n\nIt's all the same. You shouldn't have to tell a person 100+ times not to do something over the course of several years; you *really* shouldn't be all hurt and flabbergasted when the person who's been repeatedly asking the same thing of you, damn near inevitably, starts doing exactly what they said they'd do if you don't stop. That's what's childish. Following through and doing what you feel necessary to insure those around you understand your boundaries, and therefore will be making it truly possible to tell if this person just doesn't know better (didn't truly understand the situation and/or it's gravity) or doesn't care enough to respect you in the way you deem is respectful. No one gets to tell you what that looks like but you and YOU teach people how to treat you. They will only do to you what you allow and OP no longer wanted to allow the passive nature of the situation at large. Of course they new that the consequence she chose for the situation would do precisely what did end up happening. \n\nYeah their mom is mad, but anger is a secondary emotion. This lady is hurt. Not by the tattoo. Not by the \"I don't know\"s. She is hurt because this thing that she did, constantly apparently, is no longer going to be tolerated. Not in the \"mom I don't like that,\" kind of way. In the, \"oh shit my baby is an adult making adult decisions that I don't agree with and I'm no longer in a position to sway her in the direction I think would best benefit me. If this lady ever thought before asking these questions she likely would ask them at all. They're dumb ass questions! NTA. Mommy don't haaaaave a baby no mo'; she gots a grown ass mature adult! \n\nJust a bit petty; though I don't see how being knowledgeable of the constant agitation you bring someone with something you can very easily just not do and then being shown, in albeit an extreme way, that they now have to deal with the aforementioned consequences. Didn't, and still don't, have to like 'em nor agree to them, this goes for everyone. They are there and they are valid. And if you cross peoples boundaries those consequences with be there too.
