Although I think the whole sense of pride statement he made is stupid and patriarchal it\u2019s the other things you\u2019ve shared that make me suggest considering hyphenating. \n\nYou mentioned that he plans to be heavily involved, is a good dad to his current kiddos, and will likely have a similar week on/off arrangement with you that he has with his ex. Although the reason he said was ridiculous, if he\u2019s generally a good person and a good father could it be that he also wants his daughter to feel connected to him/her half-siblings on his side in the same way you\u2019d like her to feel connected to you/her half-sibling on your side? \n\nIf he\u2019s not otherwise an asshole, which by your comments about him it doesn\u2019t seem that way, it might not be a stretch to think he just did a shitty job of articulating his intentions. There\u2019s a difference between proud that a kid bears his name because he\u2019s passing his name down blah blah whatever or proud that his kid knows that they\u2019re wanted and fully considered an equal part of their extended family.
