{"id": 17008, "submission_id": "13f49x2", "title": "AITA for telling my sister she can only use my wedding dress if she agrees to give it back after her wedding?", "selftext": "I've (28F) been married for six years now. My sister (22F) is getting married to her fiance in a couple months, and since they're going low budget have only recently started planning. When I got married, my sister asked if she could use my dress for her wedding, since we're basically the exact same size and shape (She even tried it on once at the time with no issue)\n\nI told her that would probably be fine, I didn't make any promises but she was 16, so we never really had a serious talk about it. The thing is as odd as it sounds, I'm still using it. I really hated the fact that I'd only get to wear the dress once, and I saw some other women who'd had the idea of continuing to wear it from time to time.\n\nOn our anniversary, I'll put my dress on, my husband puts on his suit, and we'll have a little indoor date night where we pretend we just got married again. There've been other times too, but my point is basically I still use the dress for things besides taking up closet space. \n\nSo when my sister asked if she could have the dress for her wedding, I said she could, but only if I got it back afterwards, and she told me any alterations she made so I could have them undone. She didn't want to agree to that, and said she'd just find her own. I could tell she was dissappointed, but she didn't make a scene and she was understanding.\n\nWho isn't being understanding is our mother, who called me a couple days later. She heard from my sister (Who wasn't snitching on me, she just mentioned it off hand) And accused me of being manipulative. She says I should've just refused or let her keep it, and it was rude of me to give that condition with my offer. My sister is actually on my side, and has been telling my mom to drop it, but she might be right that I shouldn't have bothered offering.", "created_utc": 1683848909, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13f49x2/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_can_only_use_my/", "score": 242, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re still using the dress. What happens if food or wine is spilt on the wedding day, that can\u2019t be undone? Your mom would have a issue if you rejected borrowing the dress too.", "Hmmm... If you and your sister are in agreement and have no issues, I'm having a hard time understanding why your mother is so upset. If my kids work something out between them, and it doesn't affect anyone else, I'm all for it.\n\nAnd, FWIW, you have every right to keep your own wedding dress, even if you didn't use it from time-to-time, no questions asked.\n\nYou are NTA.", "It\u2019s your dress and just because you lend it to your sister doesn\u2019t mean that it then belongs to her. NTA", "NTA both you and your sister agree. Your mom is being the asshole. Why does she care if your sister did or did not use your dress? It's your sister's wedding and she understood your criteria and decided to get her own dress. Your mom is making it a bigger deal than it has to be.", "This is so dumb. Obviously NTA.  Your mother sounds like she needs drama in her life.", "NTA but this really doesn\u2019t even sound like a conflict. Your sister is fine with your answer. Your mom just needs butt out, it was none of her business in the first place and she made an issue where there wasn\u2019t one.", "Nta. It's your dress. If you lend any outfit out you have a right to demand/expect it to be returned in the same condition. Unaltered. And clean. The fact that it's your wedding dress and the fact you actually still wear yours as an occasional date night tradition makes the sentimental attachment even stronger. Its rude of your mother to demand that you hand over your dress. If your mom is so concerned with what your sister wears then she can pay for a gown.", "NTA. Conditions aren't necessarily a bad thing. Neither you nor your sister were jerks about this whole thing. You mom needs to mind her own damn business here.", "Sounds like your sister is fine with it, so NTA. TA here is your mom.", "NTA. Your use of the dress is really sweet and it sounds like your sister understands just fine. Ignore your mom. She has no sense of romance, apparently.", "NTA\n\nIt's really odd that your mother has gotten involved unless of course she is footing the bill for the wedding and now your sister is hitting her up for a new wedding dress. \n\nAnd consider this, perhaps your sister wanted a new dress all along and was looking for a reason to turn down your dress. She probably knows you still use it and weren't going to give it up completely.\n\nCompletely not your problem and I love that you and your husband get dressed up in your wedding attire for anniversaries and other special events. That is really special.\n\nLet your mother and sister sort this out. There is no upside for you.", "NTA. Your mother is a busybody who didn't even have any business butting into your and your sister's negotiations about the conditions of the dress use. You stated your conditions, your sister didn't find them agreeable and went with another option, that's it, end of the story. How is it your mother's business?", "Equally possible that if you had just refused, your mom might have called you and said you were unfair by just refusing instead of letting your sister borrow the dress. Either way, even your mom is admitting that you didn't have to offer to give it to your sister at all - anything more than that is a kindness.\n\nNTA", "No, you're not. It's your dress. My sister offered her dress to me whenever I get married. I'd never alter her dress if i couldn't fit it or assume it's mine after. I helped her pick it out, it's her dream dress.", "NTA. It's your dress. If you are gracious enough to loan it then it should come back in same condition it went out.  \n\nI don't see this as manipulative, rather ground rules for borrowing your dress.", "NTA\n\nYour anniversary tradition sounds really sweet and even if you hadn\u2019t planned on wearing it again this is a memento from (presumably) one of the happiest days of your life so of course you would want to keep it. Nothing wrong with only lending on those terms", "You're still regularly using the dress and plan to continue doing so. You set some reasonable conditions for your sister to use it and while she understood the conditions she didn't feel she could accept them. No harm no foul. It would be a completely different situation if the dress was just hanging in the closet.\n\nNTA, and mom needs to drop it and move on.", "I don't think this is an A H situation, but your mom is trying to turn it into one. Your life has changed and the dress has taken on a new meaning to both you and your husband - love the date idea! Have you sat your sister down and explained why you still use the dress?\n\nYour mom, on the other hand - you know her best and good luck.\n\nNAH unless Mom escalates.", "NTA\n\nYour mother needs to take 3 big steps backwards. It sounds like the only problem here is the one she's creating!\n\nYou and your sister had a little negotiation about the dress & your terms for her using your dress weren't acceptable to her. No harm,  no foul.", "NTA. I think loaning the dress with the condition it be returned is incredibly generous and reasonable. Does this accusation from your mother reflect how she treats you vs. your sister in general, or is this new behavior?", "NTA - Mom can have an opinion but the two woman involved in the topic are fine with the outcome. Move on and keep your marriage flame alive!", "NTA \n\nAnd I love that you're creating even more memories with it!", "NTA. Your mom is creating problems where none exist. And it would make sense for your sister to have her own dress. Your conditions are perfectly reasonable given that you want your dress back to use for certain occasions.", "NTA. Honestly, don't give her your dress. She can get a great one off poshmark or a similar site.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is being weird about this. It\u2019s your dress. You still use it.\n\nI actually think your offer was extremely generous - sounded like you were going to pay for any alterations when you got it back? I\u2019d have been asking my sister to cover those as well.", "NTA- but your mom sure is. I think it\u2019s really sweet and romantic y\u2019all get all gorgeous and celebrate wearing your wedding attire.", "NTA, sounds like mom is pissy about having to spend money on a dress now.", "NTA you are more generous than I would have been. I would never ever let anyone else wear my wedding dress but my daughter", "I would say that you are NTA, but you are maybe not thinking this through. \n\n1.  Anything can happen.  Wine gets spilled.  Cake gets smashed.  Soda or punch stains.  Curry puffs with turmeric can stain.  It may not be on purpose but it can ruin the dress.  A bad fall can rip it all apart.  \n\n2.  A dress\u2014any dress\u2014will probably need altering.  And with some alters, there\u2019s no going back.  So if she needs the waist tightened or the train altered or something, then that may not be reversible.  You may not\u2014even in the best instance\u2014get back what you gave her.  Beads may be lost.  Lace may be lost. \n\n3.  Unfortunately even in the best case, once she has been given the dress, it is hers.  And if she makes a stink that she\u2019s going to keep it, then the law may be on her side unless you are really careful.  And it might not be worth the expense to try to take her to court to get it back. \n\nSis may be a lovely and honest person, and she may be completely aboveboard.  However, there are a lot of gray areas where things can go wrong. Get any agreements in writing with signatures.", "NTA\n\nIs it totally out of the realm of possibility that besides that you still use it you might want to pass it on to a daughter or get buried in it? Maybe putting it that way will back your mother off.", "You and your sister are in agreement here, there's no conflict. Your mother's opinion as an uninvolved 3rd party is irrelevant.", "You aren\u2019t the asshole. I think your sister just needs to find her own dress. \n\n\u201cOn our anniversary, I'll put my dress on, my husband puts on his suit, and we'll have a little indoor date night where we pretend we just got married again. There've been other times too, but my point is basically I still use the dress for things besides taking up closet space.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m just commenting because I can\u2019t help point out that this unusual behavior. Whatever floats your boat though. Also, congrats on still fitting in your wedding dress 6 years later. I\u2019m quite sure my wife still would as well, and we\u2019ve been married 12 years and have two kids. Her wedding dress has lived in a storage container in the garage for a decade. After reading your post I kind of want to convince her to put it on one night for playtime lol.", "NAH.

Your sister asked and you answered. The dress is yours. She asked to have it. You said, no, but you can borrow it. That's fine.", "YTA.  It's just a dress.  Let it go.  Get another one if you need it.  Let your sister be the one you pass it on to.  You will smile great big when she walks down the aisle.  You will have photos.

Sisters and moms are irreplaceable!", "NTA don't let her use YOUR dress.  Even if you didn't use it, it's weird to ask", "Awwww!  I think it\u2019s really sweet that you dress up for your anniversary!  Glad your sister is on your side.  Having kids with their own relationship, working together, getting along, and listening to each other, is a parent\u2019s dream.  Your mother is grabbing defeat from the jaws of victory.

I scored my wedding dress from an expo for $100, originally $900 and it was EXACTLY what I had been looking for. Its possible for your sister to find her own special dress on a budget and she can keep it forever. Mom needs to chill.", "NTA. Leave it to moms to stick their nose in where it doesn't belong. I think its weird that anyone would suggest that you shouldn't get the dress back. Sister is doing this to be frugal, this isn't like a family dress that gets passed down. Its yours and you were being kind in entertaining the idea at all.", "Classic narc mom starting shit between kids", "I stopped reading when sister didn\u2019t want to agree to ops conditions to borrowing her dress..don\u2019t give her your dress she needs to buy her own.
