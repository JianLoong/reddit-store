In a dark, cold, quiet room. If I try to talk, it sounds (and feels) like a megaphone blaring inside my head - though according to my husband when I try to talk during a migraine he can barely hear me as it apparently comes out barely a whisper. Moving at all increases the nausea. Light and sound do the same. Getting up causes dizziness.\n\nIf I were in bed with a migraine, getting myself up and walking around to go find kids who were playing loudly (so, moving toward the noise) to deal with the situation and ask them to be quiet would itself actually be really challenging and also just plain painful.", "Okay but OP was at work and didn't see the message. Slightly different scenario.

Drop everything and tell him to shut up? \n\nAlso, having been in her position before, it's MY duty to help myself in that situation (noise cancelling headphones, eyemask, ice cap, painkillers etc..), i will never force people around me to change  what they're doing because of migraines, especially if they are a recurring issue. \n\nCould the husband have behaved better? Sure! \nIs he an asshole because his wife won't seek better medical treatments for her migraines? No", "She's pregnant not an invalid. She could've just shouted down to the kids if she didn't want to move", "Send the children outside if possible.  If she cannot and the kids continue to be loud she can also go outside.

Maybe you don't have any?", "You can, but they will get loud eventually.  5 and 8 are still young children", "The pregnant part is what makes this worse as if she usually takes a pain pill they are almost certainly off the table at the moment.

But we weren\u2019t tip toeing around the house with white noise machines during naps either.

Ya, my grandmother has celiacs and recommended me try gluten free for years. I finally did and now it's so much better. So happy you got yours under control!", "Yeah, I missed that ending part.  Obviously, yes, you tell the kids to be quiet.  But I'm still not understanding the wife not asking them to be quiet, or not telling her husband that she's going to sleep.

Dad can take the lead here.", "I certainly couldn't if I was her, passing out, being sick or not being able to see just a few reasons I couldn't walk to children to ask them to be quiet.\nNot to mention as a pregnant woman there probably isn't much she can do for the pain besides quiet and a dark room. Certainly no pressure on her head from headphones or painkillers due to most for migraines aren't given to pregnant women..\n\nWhen the child is born she will ask the father, the other parent in the equation, to look after them. Parents are people too and are allowed to get ill. What if she ended up in an accident? Should she be expected to do all the work still then?\n\nShe's not asking people to change, but show consideration. That's what people who care about their loved ones do.

Our 11 understands when mom or dad had a headache to talk softly and play quietly or outside of he wants to be loud and he'll take his sister with him and sets the example of how they are playing to help keep things quiet. He's been shown examples since he was small as most of our family suffers from them. Children can learn and help if they are taught.", "I absolutely agree with you on this point. For me the issue is that he doesn\u2019t even make the attempt to redirect the children, just leaves them to be noisy and then doubles down on \u2018it\u2019s their house.\u2019 It is, but he didn\u2019t even try.", "Sure. But even after an hour he didn't attempt to quiet them  that's AH behaviour for his wife and mother of his future child.\n\nI'd be mad too if I had 0 sympathy or help during a time of pain, let alone if I was also pregnant. \n\nThey may not be able to express empathy, but being a considerate person and not an AH is something I'd assume parents want to teach their children, OP would rather his wife suffer than just ask his kids to lower the volume a little bit.", "5 year olds mimic the behaviour around them.

If you are *that* debilitated, all the more reason why you call out to your partner that he needs to watch the kids. This is being a parent. You have to keep doing it.  It's ridiculous to me that people think it's fine that she sent a text with no confirmation that it was received and went to bed.  She's in this weird liminal step parent space.
