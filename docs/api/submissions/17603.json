Then I could have been more tactful so as to allow it to come to full fruition rather than walk away on instinct. This would have made things much less stressful for her so that it was just a rejection and not also an embarassment.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Obviously. You said it yourself, you really didn't want her touching you. You were both kids and she probably also isn't TA, just a very social awkward kid.

I imagine if this were the other way around all the N A H responses would be different.", "NTA.  You can\u2019t make another person cry unless you put onions in her eyes or sprayed her with chemicals.  You spoke to her, and she cried.  It sounds like you spoke to her politely and with respect, and she cried.  Don\u2019t get hung up on people\u2019s reactions when you act appropriately.  If you were cruel to her, you would owe ol\u2019 leaky eyes an apology.  But you weren\u2019t.", "NTA\n\nMaybe NAH since she meant no harm", "NTA. She was dumb for dragging you instead of asking, like \"I have something to tell you\" etc. She failed on basic human to human communication.", "NAH - No harm done or intended on either side, just an awkward interaction and some misunderstandings.", "NAH - She wanted to ask you privately, you didn't know what was going on, she asked, you said no, she's hurt now but that's just part of life and it's better than leading her on. Nothing wrong here, just normal dating stuff.", "NTA, you handled that well, I feel. Including checking on her after a direct and honest refusal.", "Unsure how long ago this occurred, but you have to appreciate her having the courage to ask you to prom. She could have taken a different approach, like tapping you on the shoulder and waiting for you to acknowledge her, and then asking if she could talk with you privately.\n\nNAH, although I do hope you let her down a bit easier that just saying you weren't into her like that....but the awkward adolescent ages in high school, I'm sure she didn't take it well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
