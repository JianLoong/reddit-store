Other conditions include not dating certain races or religions. \n\nSo I\u2019m Bi, but mostly prefer men. My parents always made it abundantly clear that they hated my \u201clifestyle choices\u201d, and would always say that it\u2019s just a phase I\u2019ll eventually grow out of. So the condition they set for me is that I need to dating or married to a women to collect the money. I was pretty pissed about the whole situation, but not much I could do about it. \n\nAbout 6 months after my parents died, I was venting to one of my best friends about the situation. She proposed that we could become roommates and pretend to be in a relationship so that I could collect from the trust. So that\u2019s what we started doing about a year and a half ago. \n\nFast forward to current day, one of my siblings caught me out with another man and told my fake partner. My friend and I both talked to my sibling, and explained the situation. My sibling said I was an AH, and what I was doing was wrong. They agreed that our parents were terrible and homophobic, but said they were still entitled to choose what they did with their money. They also said that I need to come clean and tell our parent\u2019s lawyer that I am not actually dating a woman. I argued that I don\u2019t need to be concerned about the opinions of overly judgmental bigots. \n\nSo AITA for continuing to collect from the trust?

Just date or be married to one and you technically are dating this one. I see no foul play. NTA. What you guys have is technically an \u201copen relationship\u201d and if your trust says nothing about *not* having an open relationship then you\u2019re in the clear.", "You just need to be dating a woman? That's fine. Now you're poly.", "It's weird that it requires him to be dating. What if OP isn't dating anyone at all that month?", "Actually,  YTA. You could walk away , but your greed is more than your values.", "Definitely don\u2019t tell the estate lawyer that it was a farce. Feel free to deny or provide an alternative explanation for the events \u201cwe are in an open relationship and didn\u2019t want others to know\u201d etc.", "The siblings are affected. I think it's pretty obvious that this sibling is trying to rat-fuck OP here for his share.", "I mean why does it matter where it comes from? That always sounds so strange to me, no one's getting hurt by getting the money and if they are in America it's always good to have extra money to put on a house.", "Does getting married count, or does he have to continue dating outside his marriage? Like this is ridiculous all around.", ">So the condition they set for me is that I need to dating or married to a women to collect the money.", "This is not legal advice but it seems logical that he could claim that he hit a rough patch in the relationship and they were temporarily separated. And if need be, he could claim that they\u2019ve reunited if he has further money to withdraw. I don\u2019t see how any lawyer could prove what\u2019s going on or not in their bedroom", "You don\u2019t have to be greedy to pursue an inheritance. Grow up.", "That's REALLY state specific.", "If they tell, would \"we have an open relationship\" or \"I was cheating on my partner\" be good enough, or would it get you cut off? That might be the kind you thing you should discuss with **your** lawyer (which is the only lawyer you should discuss any of this with).", "Of you're in the U.S please speak with a lawyer. Speak with a couple if you can. If you and your siblings are all on board to getting off the restrictions of the trust, unified there's actually several ways (and this various by state.) To do it. Even if it's an irrevocable trust. They aren't actually as irrevocable as a lot of people think.", ">So the condition they set for me is that I need to dating or married to a women to collect the money.", "True, but this would be classified as an \u201cincentive trust.\u201d The OP isn\u2019t entitled to their parents money, so then having requirements for them to access the money is pretty normal honestly.", "I say poly then. Doesn't have to be romantic, go on dates have fun, be close friends - technically you can say your dating. Just.. not exclusively. Doesn't sound like it was a requirement. They should have thought of that.", "Same for wills, though: heirs are not entitled to anything, but certain provisions have been found unenforceable. Is it bc wills are considered more of an entitlement than trusts? Is it bc trusts can be revocable? Are trusts just a way to get around rules governing wills? I honestly don't know the answer.", "Are your parents going to crawl out of their graves and take the money back? Fuck 'em.

This leaves you open to legal risks.\n\n\u201cWe have an open relationship.\u201d Would have been a much better response.

Anytime any story has the words \u201cfalse pretenses\u201c in it, your pretty an AH.", "I mean you could argue you are dating your roommate and other people at the same time. NAL", "NTA. Controlling your children\u2018s lives from the grave is not ok and in some places illegal for exactly this reason. Either you give the money without condition or you write that kid out of the will. It\u2019s your life.", "NTA.", "You have an open relationship with her. She doesn't mind sharing. Or whatever act like you are with her and she is cool with being with it.", "NTA.\n\nAt the end of the day, your parents were homophobic bigots and don't deserve your consideration or respect of their views.\n\nGet your own lawyer before telling anybody about this.", "You are dating a woman. Platonically. You're just poly. \nProblem solved, but def consult a lawyer. NTA?", "NTA  But my your parents were something else to insert that much conrol of your lives after they were gone.  I say keep doing what works for you and good luck to your siblings proving otherwise.", "You're NTA, but your sibling is totally going to tell the lawyer. A good sibling you could trust would have said, \"Good for you.

You need to hire a lawyer to look over the trust.", "NTA,\n\nBut don't confess you committed fraud. That's not a smart thing to do.

Do your siblings collect more money if you cannot based on the provisions. If so, I wouldn't trust anything they say.", "GET YOUR OWN LAWYER", "NTA. How absurd. And your sibling is just as bigoted if they\u2019re really making those comments. They agreed with ur parents secretly", "YTA, and probably also in legal trouble. Not defending bigotry, but lying and fraud is not the way to go.", "NTA, but get a lawyer, because A) it seems like your sibling might take matters into their own hands and B) I don\u2019t know much about civil law or trust funds, but I have to imagine there are certain requirements for what kind of stipulations people can give in these situations.", "Hijo get a lawyer. And delete this entire thing if you're smart.", "NTA. That\u2019s just a crappy situation", "This is a toughie\n\nI am on OPs side until I think about his siblings having to do whatever their own onerous requirements are (ie. Diligently attending church) and it feels slightly unfair\n\nOn the flip side.... if simply getting married to a woman is enough..... is there a woman who would want a relationship on paper for some reason ??", "Get legal advice from where your parents estate is\u2026 some of these clauses are unenforceable if they\u2019re discriminatory.", "Please OP, go to a lawyer.  These stipulations for the trust will not stand in a court.  You can contest trusts and wills.", "Well, did the stipulations state that he had to exclusively date a woman in order to collect? Because he could theoretically be dating a woman\u2026 and a man. Loophole?", "More likely than not stipulations like that would not hold up in court if challenged.", "This is a fucked up take.", "Came here to say this...he can be simultaneously dating a man and a woman, one does not need to be exclusive.", "Even with how discriminatory it is against a protected class?", "If there were no legal reasons why OP couldn't take the money, I completely agree.\n\nMy original post was poorly worded, because the question about taking the money was not about moral scruples, but legal issues OP may encounter and run potentially afoul of the law.", "It matters if the money comes by OP through fraudulent means (that is to say, OP knowingly lies in order to satisfy the inheritance requirements).\n\nBut a lawyer could more easily figure out if the inheritance requirements are legally enforceable. Definitely no moral reason why OP couldn't take money from bigoted parents, the issue is a potential legal one.", "except he told his sibling (and he wrote a reddit post) that claims otherwise", "It seems logical that he could cover up his fraud with more fraud and then add some perjury when this inevitably ends up in court?\n\nLmao this is the worst advice in the whole thread.", "I hope you're right! It would be satisfying for this all to ultimately be taken down legally... not just for OP, but for the other siblings who have to do inane things like go to church more (faith shouldn't be compelled for money).", "well it seems to me he was living with a woman so does it matter what they are doing in the bedroom?  I mean there are a lot of married couples who do not have sex.", "It\u2019s also probably not legal to demand he have sex with a woman to collect the money.", "It depends on what they said and what the words of the trust are, but yes, it probably does matter. The trust itself may or may not be enforceable but lying to satisfy the conditions and obtain property is a big no no in every common law jurisdiction I am aware of. \n\nThey need a lawyer immediately, this is a clusterfuck all around.", "You need a lawyer right now.  I suspect that some of the conditions of your parents will are unenforceable (as well they should be; trying to enforce racial discrimination or discrimination based on sexual preference aren't things the courts should support), depending on your local laws.\n\nYou are NTA, but oh dear, one hates to speak ill of the dead, but what A's!!!", "F your bigoted parents. NTA but your siblings are selfish AHs for not supporting you.", "NTA.\n\nI don't see an issue. The fact that your own parents made your love life hostage to prevent you from getting what they would otherwise have given you... is gross.\n\nAlso, people have open relationships all the time. \n\nThe only issue is you should never have told your siblings the truth and just said you have an open marriage.", "Guess I\u2019ll go against the grain here and say that regardless of how backwards your parents opinions were, that\u2019s what they believed in. You don\u2019t have to like it but basically committing fraud to access their money (because it is theirs, they earned it) to get it even though you hate it seems morally wrong and definitely legally wrong.", "op=NTA Morally\n\nBUT, if your sibling tattles, you may be in legal trouble.  \n\nIf you can \"drain\" the trust by marrying. maybe your friend would sign a prenup and marry you(then quickie divorce)?  \n\nThis level of control shouldn't be legal as far as I'm concerned.  I know some inheritances can't have certain restrictions(I'm thinking movie Body Heat).  But you would probably have to have a lawyer look at the terms of the trust and see if they could be overrode.  Or if a quick marriage would fulfil the terms.", "NTA. Your parents are dead, and your brother can mind his business. If your brother tattles to the lawyer,  either deny it or say that you are dating, but recently decided to have an open relationship (if that\u2019s allowed in the terms).", "NTA for collecting under false pretenses but you aren\u2019t too sharp since you told your sibling. They may even rat you out.", "Tell your brother you're in an open relationship? It didn't say it had to be a monogamous relationship. Or I guess time to get real- married lol", "Am i the only one here that thinks that the conditions attached related to the choice of gender in partner are in conflict with the right of freedom and choice, which would mean its in conflict with the constitution and therefor could be completely dismissed... i guess it depends on the country, but i would be surprised if such conditions could actually hold up in court.\n\nI feel sorry for you that your parents were such AH, that even haunt people in their death (because thats what they started doing when setting these conditions) i would advise you try and be independent of their money. Yes it sucks, but id rather live life on my own terms anyway.\n\nAnyway you are in the wrong for comitting fraud legally, and might be denied any claims based on that now.", "NTA, fuck em", "YTA. Trusts exists so that people could control what happens to their money when they aren't around anymore. I fully disagree with how they've treated you for who you are, but those are their money, and their views.", "NTA, your parents are trying to control your life from the grave, which is pretty awful. You should have just said you have an open relationship.", "OP is committing fraud, so... no, he can't really just say \"f it\". He's NTA, but the entire point of a trust is the benefactor gets to set the terms.", "There are stipulations that aren't legally enforced. Op definitely needs his own lawyer", "I think that is almost the exact definition of M/F porn. \n\nPay someone to have sex with you not okay, but paying someone to have sex with another someone you are paying totally fine."]}
