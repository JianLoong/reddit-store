How can you accept a gift \"with good will\" if it wasn't given with good will?", "NTA. Your brother is crossing serious lines in an already strained relationship. He knows exactly what he's doing by trying to push a Bible on you. It's a passive aggressive tactic the religious try to police other people's behaviors and lives and your mother is wrong. You don't owe her an explanation on why she's wrong either.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to accept passive aggressive attacks in the form of \u201cgifts.\u201d\n\nNext time say, \u201cThanks! We needed something to wedge the shed door open when we\u2019re working on the lawn outside. This will be perfect for that.\u201d", "NTA, it doesn't sound like it was offered as an olive branch, but rather another sad passive attempt at conversion and not accepting you as you are.", "NTA. Your brother is awful. Your mom isn't any better at this point.", "NTA you politely declined a gift that was designed to let you know there is something wrong with you. You actually were the opposite of an A. You could have said how offensive his gift was to you. Classy response imo.", "NTA, but in my experience this is what you're in for with a JW. Maybe go low or no contact.", "You can always use it for the inaugural fire in the fireplace.  NTA.", ">this is a peace offering\n\nIt so isn't.\n\nNTA", "NTA.   \nThe part that kills me is when he says about it being a peace offering to \"put you on the right track.\" If you aren't already, I'd say go low contact or no contact.", "NTA - your mom and your brother are massive AHs.  Have they ever heard of the ten commandments?  How about the commandment, \"Thou shall not judge\"?  \n\nI get annoyed when people use religion to back up their evil behavior.  And their behavior is truly evil.  \n\nTime to go NC with your brother until he apologizes.  What a dick.", "NTA.\n\nThat was not a piece offering.\n\nIt also wasn\u2019t a house warming gift.\n\nIt does however show that your brother cares more about a 3000-2000 year old book that has been translated by many people over many years, than he cares about you as a person. The New Testament wasn\u2019t even written until 50 and 100 years after Jesus died. So I am pretty sure it\u2019s not \u201cscreen accurate\u201d. And even if it was, didn\u2019t Jesus preach about loving and accepting each other? I definitely missed the part where he said LGBTQ+ was bad.", "Info do jehovas witnesses even celebrate house warmings? I know they don't do birthdays I'd have assumed they wouldn't be big on that either NTA", "NTA.   I would have thrown it in the fire pit and made smores", "NTA that wasn\u2019t a gift, it was a bludgeon.", "NTA. That bible wasn\u2019t a gift. Gifts are nice and given with good intentions. That bible was solicitation to a belief system that doesn\u2019t respect your humanity.", "NTA. Tell bro his relationship with Jehovah sounds pretty homoerotic considering he\u2019s based his entire personality around one man, tell mom only Judge Judy can judge you, then start delivering your own sermon based on the gospels of Cyndi, Madonna, Cher and Dolly. \n\nI\u2019d print out business cards with the lyrics to Born This Way and every time he tried to push Jesus, push back with Gaga. Stick one on his windshield. Stick it on his dinner plate. Place a stack on the living room table. Include one in every Christmas/birthday gift. Play a Pride playlist every time he comes over for background music. Put on Drag Race in the background, or Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. Or Paris is Burning. Get a pair of fabulous drag shoes and keep them by the front door, just to see him squirm. \n\nAnd finally, ask sis if you can hang a pride flag in the living room.", "NTA\n\nI would send a cooy of \"Crusaders: Ex Jehovah's Witnesses Speak Out (2021)\" to brother and then double check that mom tell him to accept the gift!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A good will gift would be, I don't know, a copy of Marine Manwhich or a Pride Flag or something. He is being disrespectful of you.", "NTA. This wasn\u2019t a peace offering or a gift in good will. It was a reaffirmation that he will never accept you and thinks you are horrible. \n\nHe gifted you an ultimatum and criticism. \n\nTell your mom gifting you a book of how you should be stoned and telling you that you are the wrong track is an insult to you not a gift in good faith.

Your comment reminded of a time just shortly after my mom and step-dad got married. I (45f) was around 10 years old at the time. There was a knock at the door and my mom answered it. It was an old woman and a little kid. She was immediately very friendly and my mom invited her in. After maybe 5-10 minutes of conversation my parents realized that this lady was a JW and my step-dad ordered her to leave (he really doesn't like strangers coming to his house, pushing their religion on him) and told her she was wasting his time and her own. After they left my mom told my step-dad that she thought they were friends of his whom she just didn't know and he said he thought they were her friends he just hadn't met yet! It was actually pretty funny and we still bring it up occasionally and laugh about it.", "Or just use it to doodle a bunch of heretic art, you know, like writing Happy Birthday in it, or Blood Transfusionz Rule!"]}
