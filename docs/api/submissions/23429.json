I have barely slept the past few days because of dental pain/work and I'm 14 weeks pregnant so I'm exhausted from feeling sick and tired all the time. So, of course, at 9:20 I storm out of the house (he's still asleep) and go get coffee/breakfast for everyone. I get back obviously still upset about being so tired and it's practically 10am at this point. I lock myself in the room (I'm in a 1 bedroom with 2 kids and he's not on the lease) to try to eat/sleep in peace. The kids will not stop screaming or shooting toy guns. He's just on his phone on the couch curled up. \n\nI stormed out to sit on the steps and gather my thoughts and messaged him that when I came back he could either keep the kids quiet and let me sleep, take them somewhere, or he could leave himself. I don't want to look at him when I'm so sleep deprived and he gets to sleep at night and sleep in cuz it's just gonna piss me off. He stays up late playing videogames so it's not like he HAS to stay up all night/day.\n\n He said he didn't know the kids were that loud and got pissed off saying he doesn't know where to take them (we also live in a big city and there's at least 2 libraries and parks near us, plus his mom and aunts). Mind you he could have just kept them quiet with a little effort and stayed here. \n\nAm I truly the asshole in this situation? He left pissed off at me and yelling at the kids to hurry up. I also said if he's that damn mad to just go himself before he left but he refused. He wouldn't say \"I love you\" when he left which is his Hallmark being pissed off move. I didn't say it either cuz I don't want to play that game with him. I just want to sleep. \n\n\nWhen I wake up I'll read the replies on if I'm an asshole or not and if I am I'll apologize.

Just ask for what you need, as specifically as possible. \n\nNext time, when you get home with coffee and breakfast, don't unpack it. Leave it in the bag, and ask him to take them to the park to eat it. Make it easy to get what you want. Don't offer vague options and passive aggressive get out threats.

You not being able to sleep because you're working crazy hours isn't his fault, and it's not fair of you to scream at him instead of simply asking him if he can take the kids to the park and library for a few hours so you can take a nap. that said, he's got that learned helpless husband attitude, and that's not ok either. It seems you know you were in the wrong for screaming, and you really do need to apologize, especially if it was in front of the kids. that's scary to see mom that way, and it led to both of you screaming at these kids that did nothing wrong.\n\nalso, less of a fixable thing but something to consider: to all night shift people, even if you sleep during the day, it's going to leave you feeling more sleep deprived than if you slept at night.  \n\n\nEDIT: nobody was screamed at, I misunderstood what I was reading. my mistake and apologies.", "Esh - you're tired and you took it out on him.

You have created 2 human beings and are in the process of creating a third. You work to have an income. Don't ever undersell just how incredible that is.\n\nAs someone who has been severely sleep deprived for 3 years and counting (recently diagnosed with narcolepsy and only just started medication trials) I completely understand the infuriation of a bad night. That alone is enough to make anyone animalisticly angry. You have two kids already who you are responsible for, and a third who is quite literally syphoning your energy. You must be exhausted.\n\nWhat I recommend is that you do have a serious sit down with your partner. Not to yell or criticise, but to outline how you feel and what you need. Whether he is in the wrong or not, a person on the defensive will be a lot less receptive to this sort of conversation. Work towards the outcome best suited to you both.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHe is not a SAHD if he doesn't take care of the kids. He should sleep at night, and take care of the kids during the day.

You need even more rest now when you're pregnant. \n\nIt doesn't matter that he has some mental illness or whatever. It sounds like a bad excuse from a lazy ass.

I'm not sure if he's still able to or if she'll even allow it. He's very good when he tries to be and I have been trying to be supportive of him focusing on getting therapy without nagging or putting too much pressure. I understand if it's mental health because 6-7 ago I had to do intensive outpatient for a suicide attempt when life was unbearably hard so I know how much work it can be to sort yourself out.", "He impregnates her and plays video games. A real keeper!", "Yes I think I spiralled because I also know this is the last time I'll get \"good\" sleep for the next couple of years. I have tried talking to him about planning things for the kids or even working part time but he's always saying he doesn't know what to do. We live in AZ so it's very hot outside. He did babysit for his aunt recently but that didn't work out. I'm not stressed about money tho, it's the lack of sleep. At least there he could take our kids with and I could sleep for a few hours. I was injured at work last month too so going to work tired is very stressful right now.", "He stays at home, and is a dad, but doesn't sound like a stay at home dad", "If I switch to dayshift I will lose a significant amount of pay so I can't right now.

She is doing the best she can.", "I'll work on that. I wasn't sure he'd actually be up when I got back so I went to get breakfast to make it easier on everyone when he did and maybe buy a little quiet time while they ate but it didn't work. They were at it whooping and hollering like usual. I have made suggestions like the park, library, and stuff before but he doesn't like to go out. \n\nIt's hard to talk to him sometimes because he shuts down and gets mad. I also have some fear of him punching a hole in my wall or doing something dumb  because he did it at our last place and I really don't want it to happen again. Partly why I have my own place. I understand me being passive aggressive won't help the situation so I will try to talk to my doctor about getting back into therapy at my upcoming appointment on Wednesday.", "It's mostly videogames and TV. I'm here during the day cuz I work nights so I know what's going on it just so loud I can barely sleep even when I have earplugs.", "I never screamed at him. I never even raised my voice. I refuse to do that in front of my children since I grew up around it. He did yell at them to hurry up but we didn't yell at each other. We just texted while I was cooling off outside. And I have offered these options to him before many times so he knows they exist. I have always worked night shift and this is the best work life balance (3/4 nights a week with great pay and benefits) and it's the only way we can afford him to be a SAHD right now.", "Okay I'll apologize when he gets home. \nI stormed out and got breakfast because I needed fresh air before I blew up, was too tired to cook, and I knew the food would keep the kids a bit busy/quiet at least til he could wake up on his own.
