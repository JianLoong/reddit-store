So, of course, at 9:20 I storm out of the house (he's still asleep) and go get coffee/breakfast for everyone. I get back obviously still upset about being so tired and it's practically 10am at this point. I lock myself in the room (I'm in a 1 bedroom with 2 kids and he's not on the lease) to try to eat/sleep in peace. The kids will not stop screaming or shooting toy guns. He's just on his phone on the couch curled up. \n\nI stormed out to sit on the steps and gather my thoughts and messaged him that when I came back he could either keep the kids quiet and let me sleep, take them somewhere, or he could leave himself. I don't want to look at him when I'm so sleep deprived and he gets to sleep at night and sleep in cuz it's just gonna piss me off. He stays up late playing videogames so it's not like he HAS to stay up all night/day.\n\n He said he didn't know the kids were that loud and got pissed off saying he doesn't know where to take them (we also live in a big city and there's at least 2 libraries and parks near us, plus his mom and aunts).

I didn't say it either cuz I don't want to play that game with him. I just want to sleep. \n\n\nWhen I wake up I'll read the replies on if I'm an asshole or not and if I am I'll apologize.

I also have some fear of him punching a hole in my wall or doing something dumb  because he did it at our last place and I really don't want it to happen again. Partly why I have my own place.
