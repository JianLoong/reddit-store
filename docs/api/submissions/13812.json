It is enabling.", "You're right, I love my father who served time as well. I even loved him for nearly year that I had to cut him off for being a racist. \n\nI didn't talk to him or allow him to see his granddaughter until he changed his behavior. \n\nWhat I didn't do was show my love and support by allowing him into my life. Strangely enough, he didn't go running off to spend time with other people who shared his belief. \n\nHe did some introspecting, eventually apologized, saying he hadn't really thought about the impact of his behavior on my five-year-old daughter. He changed his ways because we both agreed that allowing my daughter to be exposed to racist behavior would be detrimental to her wellbeing and the successful future we both wanted for her. The world was changing and he realized he had to change as well if he wanted to stay connected to the people he loved.\n\nWhen I just objected to his racism, nothing changed. When he lost something he valued it caused him to really think about why he was saying and doing the things he was and weigh the importance of hanging on to those old beliefs and behaviors in the face of losing relationships he valued.\n\nHis brothers died racist because everyone just paid meaningless lip service to their deplorable behavior."]}
