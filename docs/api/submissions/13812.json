The world was changing and he realized he had to change as well if he wanted to stay connected to the people he loved.\n\nWhen I just objected to his racism, nothing changed.

Racism has no place in civilization, and it's truly disgusting people that tend to be racist.\n\n*However,* just because you are(rightly) against your brother, you have no place to give an ultimatum to your mom to get rid of one kid to see the other. Yall are both her kids and as shitty as it may sound, you can't just expect your mom to forget that. Sibling relationships are significantly different than parent/kid relationships. If your mom decided to send him away that would be one thing, but expecting her to pick you and send him away makes you an asshole too. You can control who you hang around, but you don't get to dictate how other relationships are handled when you're the one that was hurt.

From the perspective of society you are asking that a racist teenager be removed from a supervised environment where he is being given therapy and consequences to a place where he would be less supervised and more of a problem for other people. Also you do realize that if he was sent away he\u2019d be likely be living with PoC teens who would be much more vulnerable to him that you & your concerned parents are. What exactly would that solve? \n\nYou might feel like you are taking a stand against racism, but white people washing their hands of responsibility for their racist relatives is not exactly helping the cause.

Lots of us deal with in laws who are bigots over race, ethnicity, religion, gender, class, profession, appearance, or whatnot.

At 16, she has different likes and interests, and that may include romantically.

That\u2019s her right.\n\nNow it\u2019s time for you to start participating in therapy. Your brother sucks. But so do you. You have lots of issues to deal with, and one of those is acknowledging that you also played a role in how your relationship ended. You are accountable for how you acted as a bf.
