He\u2019s underage, she has a duty to provide housing to him, and sending him to boarding school or military school is unlikely to make him less racist. Not wanting to be around him is totally valid, but some parents don\u2019t have a desire to completely disown their kids. I also don\u2019t believe you can punish someone\u2019s views out of them, no matter how abhorrent their views. And whether or not she can afford private school is irrelevant, her finances aren\u2019t up for a democratic vote. \n\nA more reasonable request would be that he is made to leave the home only when you visit. Either he\u2019s sent to your grandparents\u2019 house for the day (or a weekend), or he\u2019s dropped off at the mall or a local coffee shop and isn\u2019t welcome back until you leave. That\u2019s a much more reasonable compromise than demanding that she send one of her kids away permanently. \n\nAnother compromise would be meeting your mom outside the house. Go out for dinner with her once or twice a week, spend a weekend day together doing something like going to a baseball game, going to the beach, whatever. It doesn\u2019t have to be all or nothing.", "ESH.\n\nYou're emotionally manipulative and your brothers a racist.\n\nYou're trying to force your mother to do something she doesn't want to do and when that didn't work, you're now threatening her with cutting contact unless she complies with your demands.\n\nI'm not defending your brother here, I'm condemning your behaviour in regards to your own family.\n\nYou don't understand why you're single mother mother doesn't want an extra expense that she doesn't *Have* to have? I understand why she doesn't wanna shell out for a boarding school.\n\nYou do not matter to your parents more than your brother does, you never *Should, You should be an equal priority*.\n\nBoth you and your brother need some serious therapy, even more so after you openly brag about \"beating his ass\" in other comments.

Your brother is an obnoxious racist. You're not. Your mother loves you both. She gets to choose who can live in her house.\n\nYour parents have tried by arranging family and sibling counseling.

If he was 2 and just repeating what other people say I\u2019d get your point but he\u2019s not. He can be comfortably called a racist because he is one and it is not the responsibility of his brother to engage with him when he refused to engage decently with his girlfriend. \nAnd from the story, im guessing he didn\u2019t just demand it, he was telling the mom the requirements for his presence. The mom can refuse him and he can stay with his dad.
