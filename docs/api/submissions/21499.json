Well this teacher didn\u2019t like me\u2026 at all, she would rather fight a grizzly bear then be nice to me. Just to make it clear I am a good student I pay attention and don\u2019t talk so I don\u2019t know why she has hates me so much. For background I have a non life threatening medical condition that means I have to go home every now and as it causes a lot of discomfort, this would only be for an hour or so (because my meds to a little while to kick in) one day while I was sitting in class and I started to feel my condition acting up so I waited until we where doing work then I went up and told the teacher what was happening. Her respond was \u201cwait a little while then you could go\u201d just to let you guys know when this condition acts up I am itchy and sweaty and I feel like I\u2019m going to die. But since I am a good person who is deathly afraid of teacher I sat there for TWO AND A HALF HOURS. when she finally let me go home I told my mom what happened and she went into mumma bear mode. Now my mom can be really scary but she doesn\u2019t raise her voice she talks calmly and doesn\u2019t yell. The next day she talked with this teacher. And the teacher responded with \u201cwell I was noticing a pattern\u201d my mom told her calmly that it wasn\u2019t her decision to make since I had permission from the SCHOOL to go home when needed. However this did not stop she proceeded to do this several more times but that wasn\u2019t what got her, no no no. (I have always had issues with my weight do to for mentioned condition) one day when we going through the dreaded \u201ctalk\u201d she was explaining something and goes \u201cthat\u2019s why some people are skinny like Jess\u201d and turns to me and goes \u201cthat\u2019s why some people like (me) are\u2026 stumpy. She paused and thought about what she was saying and the SAID IT. I told my mom when I got home and she talked to the school but this time In not so much of a kind tone. The next day at school this teacher came up to me and said that I misunderstood and \u201cI did not say that\u201d. I did not misunderstand the whole class heard her. Once again I told my mom and this time she went to the head of the school and long story short the teacher got fired.

You didn't get her fired.  Her actions did. You did the right thing going to your mom. Other parents probably had similar talks with this teacher leading to her getting fired.

You don't have the power to hire or fire staff at your school bc you're a student. Even though getting fired is bad news for ppl it doesn't mean it wasn't warranted. \n\nLeave adult matters to adults. You did the right thing by alerting adults you trust about what was going on and you advocated for yourself.

What you did here was to tell the school authorities exactly what the teacher did.", "NTA. I am going to repeat what someone else already said: you did not get the teacher fired, the teacher herself did with her own actions. Among other things, she *knew* that you had a mother that would advocate for you, but she continued to bully you (and no teacher should ever make fun of a student\u2019s weight).\n\nAnd her going up to you and saying that you \u201cmisunderstood\u201d - just no. That is a teacher using her authority to try to intimidate you into changing your story because she knew she was on thin ice. That is taking things a step further than what she had previously done, and you did good telling your mother about your teacher trying to intimidate you. \n\nAlso, I would guess that, if she were fired after just these few incidents that there were most likely other parents complaining about her as well.", "NTA, they weren't doing their job correctly and were actively negativity impacting your well-being, both physical and mental.", "NTA The teacher got themselves fired.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t get her fired.
