We have a toddler and one on the way. I am 24 weeks pregnant and I've been doing work from home since I still have to take care of our 3 year old. It's a lot of stress, and that has led to a lot of arguments with my husband. Though we have always stuck through. Lately though, I've been extremely tired since family coming and such for holidays. Due to this I havent been up to doing intimate things with my husband. He hasn't been the most happy about this but I just cant do it right now. So lately he's been going out to bars with his friends and coming home late. I hate this, I can never sleep whenever he isnt there. And he comes in extremely loud. So not only will he wake me up but also our kid.  He'll come in very drunk and I have to go out my kid back to sleep which takes a while sometimes. Then he'll just go in ur bed and pass out. So a few days ago I told him that he was not allowed to go out and come back at 4 am, if he was gonna go out he needed to be back home at least a reasonable time. He got very upset about this. So when he went to work I went out and got a new lock I knew he was gonna go out and not take me seriously. Then he went out with his friends again that night. I stayed awake till 1 am waiting for him and when he didnt I began to change the lock. It took a while but I wanted to get my point across. At 4:36 am I heard banging on the door and knew it was him. I got up and peeked out the window he saw me and I knew he was drunk. I let him in and he began to yell at me. When he was done I was in tears and my toddler was  crying in his bed. I went over to put him down again and I just went to bed. We havent talked since that incident. I feel like I did something extremely wrong. I dont want to this to end our marriage and I dont want to get too stressed and cause harm to my pregnancy. I'm extremely worried, was I being an asshole?", "created_utc": 1669499770, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5j4rx/aita_for_changing_the_locks_after_my_husband_went/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sex shouldn\u2019t be the main priority. \n\nIt\u2019s not so much of a problem going out to the pub with friends as a way to let loose. The problem is him showing home late and not caring about waking everyone up.\n\nYou set boundaries and said you wanted him home earlier. His fault for not caring. You went through with the decision. Shame you let him inside, should have kicked him out for the night, maybe then he\u2019d think about his actions.\n\nGo to couples counselling. Lack of intimacy is a real issue in relationships.

He can live with his drinking buddies.", "NTA! Why did you let him in after changing the lock? It sounds like you are a single mom with 2 kids and the 3rd on its way. Coming home drunk at 4 in the morning and waking everybody up is not a very adultish behavior. \n\nSit down with him, talk to him and give him an ultimatum. Would you have a place to stay? \n\nYou definitely need counselling, he seems to have a problem with alcohol.", "NTA. Your husband is a drunk and is harming you and your child.

The half measure is not going to work and depending where you could be illegal you need to decide if you want you're new baby born into such a negative environment but if I was you I'd go stay somewhere else and only go back if he gets coinciding.

Nothing he's doing is how a good husband/father behaves and I'm honestly worried because it sounds like he's escalating toward violence. Is he driving home drunk? But dealing with that by changing the locks when you knew he'd be coming home as an irrational drunk was not a good idea. I know a lot of people are telling you to change the locks and not let him in. That may seem like the right thing, but it's not the safe thing. Do you have family or friends to stay with for awhile? If so and you still want to work toward saving your marriage, make reconciliation dependent on counseling and treatment for alcohol addiction.", "I think you need to pack some bags and go stay elsewhere for a bit.

How did he get home? Is he drinking & driving? Get marriage counseling or a good divorce lawyer!!", "NTA. I'm impressed with your ability to change the locks yourself! Quite a skill. \n\nYour husband sucks I'm sorry. Throwing a tantrum about the intimacy issue, then coming home at 4am when he has parental responsibilities. \n\nI mean, that's an amazing way to make you point...but with his horrible reaction don't know if it was worth it. I would get some help with your relationship before it spirals more.", "NTA for changing the lock but why the heck did you let him in after? Kind of defeated the point. He\u2019s not a good man and you should consider how you want the rest of your life to look.", "Honey, if you don't want this to end your marriage, get into counseling.  Now. \nYou didn't do anything wrong, per se, but this is not the way to handle it, and this is way above Reddit's pay grade. \n\nI'm not making a judgment, because I don't think the locks are the problem", "ESH, your husband for all the obvious reasons.  For you, I actually applaud your move, but you backed down too easily.  That totally negated any impact and tells your huband that all he has to do is make a bigger fuss and he can break you any time he wants to.  You are being very unfair to yourself and even more so to your child.  GET OUT OF THERE!!  Or get him gone until he gets treatment for his alcohol and narcissistic personality issues.  He shouldn't lay eyes on either of you until he's gotten himself under control.", "Why are you with this man he's not mature enough to be a husband and father and you're bringing yourself down to his level.", "A 34-year-old man out until 5:00 a.m. drinking with a baby on the way?  eeesh\n\nESH\n\nYou're being passive aggressive and he's being a sloppy drunk.", "ESH\n\nHe sounds like he has an issue and is certainly not acting like a responsible partner or parent, but you locked a grown man out of his house to \u201cmake a point\u201d, of course he shouted at you, how else did you expect that to go?", "ESH.  You did do several things wrong.  One: you haven\u2019t addressed the stress and depression preventing you from being intimate with your spouse.  Two: you forbade your husband from doing something you don\u2019t like, as if he\u2019s a toddler who needs your permission.  And three: you locked him out of his house\u2026on purpose\u2026when he did it anyway.  Your husband shouldn\u2019t be developing a drinking problem because you aren\u2019t in the mood either.  I think you two need counseling to get your marriage back on track.", "NTA. You changing the locks is not what\u2019s going to end the marriage. And since you have volunteered to take his abuse and care for his children and home unassisted it wont end soon either. Not to mention that he\u2019s tantruming because you are not engaging with him intimately.", "ESH - Your husband's behavior is obnoxious, inconsiderate, and extremely narcissistic.  But it's his house too.  You have zero right to lock him out of it, even to prove a point.   That being said, you obviously did need to prove a point, and it's absolutely ridiculous that he continued to escalate once you set a boundary,  and a reasonable boundary at that.  \n\n\nI don't think you can do this again without it escalating even further (i.e. the police).  Is there any way you can instead making your point by leaving yourself the next time he pulls this and staying over with a friend or with family?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
