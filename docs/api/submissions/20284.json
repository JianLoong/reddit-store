I think there could\u2019ve been more done but expecting a man in his 50s to do absolutely everything for an adult who isn\u2019t his kid is kinda absurd. He housed and fed him in a time of need, more than he had to do. But that\u2019s not even the question of this post, really. No sense in debating further, don\u2019t you think?"]}
