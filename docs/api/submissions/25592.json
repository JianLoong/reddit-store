I was physically abused by both my parents and turned to drugs for comfort.\n\nI met my then gf, Catherine  when we were both 19 and I fell in love quickly. She was the opposite of me, she was kind, loving, and had a beauty I had never seen before.\nOur relationship went fast and before I knew it she was pregnant when we were 23. I decided I didn't want my child to see her father like this and began to clean myself up. \n\nMy daughter was born and it was truly the best day of my life. I was determined to not give her the same childhood horrors I had. I was still struggling  but I didn't relapse. Me and Catherine were married soon after  Audrey was born and life was perfect for me. I'm proud to say for the first 6 years of Audrey's life I didn't touch any drugs.\n\nThat failed when I lost my older brother to an overdose and that set me off again. I got rehooked on pills to help with the pain. Me and Catherine's marriage fell apart and she filed for divorce. I eventually found myself divorced, homeless, an addict, and without my little girl. I often found myself outside of Audrey's school watching her on the playground, receiving class awards, doing class plays, all without me there.\n\nIt wasn't until she was 8 and I hadn't been there for over a year when I realized I had to get my shit together. I rented a shitty apartment and worked everyday at some fast food places. I would go multiple nights without dinner so I could give Catherine money.\nAfter I saved some money up I enrolled in a local (debt I\u2019m still paying off) college and graduated with a engineering degree. I got a decent job and moved out of my crappy apartment to a tiny, but much more livable apartment.\n\nThis entire time I haden\u2019t been allowed to see\nAudrey but kept in contact with Catherine. She sent me photos, videos, and occasionally let me talk to Audrey. \n\nNow to present day I have a very good job, a 2 story house, a backyard , and in a much better mental state. I have been paying child support on time each month, sending Audrey an allowance for whatever she wants. She comes over every weekend. Last night Audrey asked if she could come live with me permanently because she wants to be with me more. \n\nI talked to Catherine and she told me that she was ok with it. Catherine asked if she could come over on the weekend and I told her she was always welcome. Catherine and I have been interacting more and l've honestly been holding out hope that we fix our relationship. The reason I think I may be an asshole is because I was talking to a coworker and he called me an entitled asshole for thinking it was ok for me to be back in there lives. Saying I traumatized my family when I left and that I should've stayed gone. \nI nearly broke down because I really thought I fixed things. I know I hurt my family but I believed they forgave me. I really just want my daughter and Catherine back.\n\nWIBTA if I let my daughter live with me?", "created_utc": 1693093712, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162aoj8/wibta_for_letting_my_daughter_move_in/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not up to your coworker to judge that, it's up to your ex and your daughter. Congratulations for getting your shit together.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, congrats on becoming clean, and full respect to Catherine for never truly shutting you out of the narrative, you were in a position where you were unable to care for her, but she clearly made it clear to Audrey that her daddy still cared.\n\ni wouldn't pin your hopes on reconciling with Catherine, but just being friends. but the important thing is that Audrey wants to be with you, However, i wouldn't let her move in full-time, maybe a few days a week on a say trial basis so you can build from there.\n\nremember your daughter is a teenager, that's a hard time to navigate if you are building a relationship and because of everything, it has to be handed delicately. \n\nalso edit. ignore your colleague", "NTA. You're doing your best to fix what you did wrong. Not everyone in your position is willing to do so. It wouldn't surprise me if Catherine recognizes this; I highly doubt that she'd let you be in Audrey's life as much as you are if she thought that you would be an issue. Props to you for cleaning your act up and doing your best to do better.", "NTA. You are trying to right your wrongs and step up to the plate. Your coworker had no right to say that, I can see why you\u2019d hope that. It\u2019s unresolved for you, it\u2019s clear you still have feelings for Catherine. Don\u2019t force it. \nLetting your daughter live with you is between you, Audrey and Catherine.\n\nWell done on getting your life together for your daughter. \nThis post had me emotional. You should be proud.", "You are totally NTA. But your coworker certainly is.", "NTA, but your coworker definitely is. Seek out a counselor to help you with the emotions your asshole of a coworker made you feel.  You definitely deserve your daughter in your life. You've put in the work to remain sober while bettering your life.  I have no clue how your ex-wife feels tirwsrds you, but I'm sure she is proud of you for getting clean and being a good father.", "NTA \ngood job dude! you did it even if you don\u2019t get catherine back she comfortable to come over and co parent with you and that\u2019s a huge step in itself. just let time play it out form push and see where it goes.", "NAH. This is absolutely not the forum for something that's as nuanced as this situation. This needs to be between you, Catherine, your daughter and perhaps even the courts (to keep everything on the up and up and all parties protected). Talk to Catherine about what your coworker said, not random internet strangers.", "NTA well done for getting your life back on track.", "NTA. That\u2019s none of your coworker\u2019s business, and good on you for working on your relationship with your daughter", "NTA but your coworker absolutely is. It sounds like you went through a hell of a lot to get where you are, and that\u2019s something to be proud of. Rooting for you!", "It sounds like you put in the work to better yourself and your daughter and ex-wife see that. Don\u2019t worry about what your coworker said, if your family didn\u2019t want you in their lives you wouldn\u2019t be in it. Huge congrats on your sobriety and accomplishments. Keep it up", "NTA, however you have a responsibility to always be sober and never relapse again.  You have to remain a constant in your child's life and for yourself.  No matter what.  I hope that you make sure to stay active in personal therapy as well as any program you utilize for accountability with your sobriety.  Relapsing doesn't mean you are a bad parent and it seems like you have worked incredibly hard to better yourself.  Your coworker was wrong and your child will benefit knowing that you turned things around and made a mistake but also fixed it.", "NTA. You are working hard and they are seeing. The only \u201cnot cool\u201d is to hope that by having your child over you\u2019ll get close to your ex.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Family counseling might be a good investment in a healthier future. Ignore your co-worker.", "YWNBTA  NTA  - Your cruel and ill informed co-worker is an ass. Why on earth would they tear you or anyone down?! What happened to live and let live while elevating one another when possible?\n\nYour life motivation had a huge 'layer' of wanting a life without using and nurture healthy relationships. He does not get a vote. Yes, you can't deny you hurt others but the 'others' have a vote and they chose you. THIS is what matters.  Hats off to you. You created hard-won joy and peace. You are deserving of this. Your life has value. Love freely and ignore his type of noise.", "I'd slap my coworker in the face if they said some shit like that to me,,, but that's just my opinion", "NTA. Sounds like your coworker has his own unresolved issues.", "Nta, you are already doing everything right in how you are approaching the entire situation. You aren't putting pressure on them, they are choosing to give you their time and wanting to be around you. Clearly your family loves you and your coworker is an ass. You hit rock bottom and managed to dig your way out back to respectability. Your family is your reward for that, enjoy it!", "NTA. Just stay sober. Everyone deserves that second chance. Don't waste it", "NTA and massive props to you not only for cleaning up your life but for the way you accept responsibility and clearly want to do your best for Catherine and your daughter.\n\nBut let me point out where your co-worker may be coming from. There is a certain kind of addict who is perpetually getting cleaned up and then relapses. Mental illness can do this too. And the spouse and kid just get their hearts broken over and over again. It's natural for people with that kind of experience to think \"it would have been better if he had just left\". If that includes your coworker she may be projecting. And while it's wrong for her to do so, it does just emphasize how important it is for you to stay clean. \n\nI wish you the very best.", "NTA. Catherine and Audrey are quite capable of deciding whether or not you're welcome in their lives, why would you listen to a coworker? If you're unsure, have a frank discussion with your family about expectations and requirements. There's nothing wrong with checking in and making sure you're all on the same page. I hope it works out for everyone.", "NTA your coworker sounds like someone you need to not socialize with. Comments like that could easily send someone in a bad place. People change and get clean. I can see if you were a bad person but you are not. Sounds like dude is upset you got a good story and your moving well. I'm happy for you keep going.", "nta - tell your co worker to u know what....im proud of you becuase you kicked addiction ass and rose like a phoenix from the ashes.  your daughter and catherine im sure are proud of you.", "Thank you man it\u2019s been a long road and I still have awhile to go", "I definitely agree and thank you. I would never blame Catherine if she she didn\u2019t want to be with me again because of what I put her through. Our relationship is on her terms. I will likely let Audrey stay for a few weeks to see how she likes it", "Thank you and I am proud of myself. You were right and I do still love Catherine. Our relationship is completely on her terms and time. She also needs to heal from the trauma", "Thank you and I am looking into getting all of us individual therapy and family therapy. Catherine had expressed her forgiveness towards me but she needs time. Our relationship is completely on her terms because she needs to heal from the trauma too.", "Thank you man! The only thing I want right now is to begin rebuilding what I broke. Which is completely on me. Me and Catherine\u2019s relationship is on her terms and I don\u2019t want to push her.

Why not try one week on one week off or something similar. Gives you a chance to get to know each other more and build up to it.......\n\nI've got a toddler and it's hard work, let alone a teenager, take it slow and build up to it.

You stayed involved in your daughter's life in appropriate ways depending at what stage of recovery you were on and now your daughter, who clearly has forgiven you and WANTS you in her life asks for you to be more involved and Catherine agrees.

Don\u2019t ever let shame from something you\u2019ve recovered from keep you from the relationships you have. So glad she has a dad like you who put that effort in. Keep up the good work and don\u2019t let your coworker get you down. He probably has his own trauma that he hasn\u2019t worked through and is taking it out on you.", "YWNBTA.  You were TA when you went into that downward spiral, but now you're un-AHing yourself by making yourself better and doing your best to raise your daughter.  You would be TA -- hugely so -- if you were to abandon the daughter *again* now that you're in a better place.", "NTA. Good on you my dude, it takes a lot of strength to come so far back from such a low place. Your daughter and your ex-wife know exactly what it means to have you in their life, and what it means to lose you. They are the only ones with the right to decide whether or not you get to be there. Your coworker needs to butt out and let your family handle this on their own terms."]}
