It was not a stocking filler. It was not a joke present.\n\nI'm pretty hard to buy for (I don't like useless tat, and I'm not the typical bathbomb gift set person) but I was still so upset. As a grown ass adult, I had to excuse myself to my room to cry.\n\nEveryone said they felt really bad and it's because \"I love cooking\" (which I do) and I'd been complaining about needing a new one (which I did) but I mean, a \u00a31.50 plastic spatula?\n\nI cook for my family out of love. I taught my nephew how to peel and chop vegetables - and in doing so, increased his confidence around food, which he is very picky about! I meticulously plan every meal so no one goes out of budget. I go to the shops every other day to buy the freshest fruit and veg.\n\nAnd bear in mind, I got this present after already spending all the previous evening AND that morning preparing the Christmas food. After I was done crying I went back in to the kitchen and cooked for nearly another couple of hours to finish everything up.\n\nAND, my presents were incredibly thoughtful.

Maybe you can tell him to make sure and buy you something personal or have a friend of his to put a big in his ear. Otherwise you will have to throw a fit and take them all back and buy yourself something you want. Or as other have stated buy him things the same way like toothpaste and toilet paper.

Learn to be grateful, not everyone is good at gift giving (these aren't even bad gifts if you actually needed them). Try to focus on other ways your husband shows love to you.

He really was pretty selfish about the whole thing. I'd like to tell you he changed but he never did. She's been gone for years now, but his new wife is experiencing the same problem. He's just a selfish arsehole who doesn't care about making other people happy.\n\nI did have similar issues with my partner to start with. He always said he didn't know what to buy. So now before every present gifting occasion we swap lists of what we want. Sure, I don't get surprises, but I do get nice gifts. His problem wasn't not caring just not knowing what to do. Now we're both happy with our gifts.\n\nSeeing as your kids even tried to get your partner to buy something else it sounds like you have a partner similar to my mother, one who sees gift giving as some obligation rather than trying to make you happy. Is he like this outside of present giving? Does he often put his wants and needs first? It sounds like he also sees the housework as your domain too. Does he contribute to the cleaning? Does he ever say or do nice things to make you happy? Or only contribute when he has to and then expect a party thrown because he \"helped\".\n\nIf yes to this, then you should re-think your relationship. You deserve to be with someone who wants to make you happy. Someone who thinks of you often. Someone who would realise that the house needed some new items and just get them.

You are something outside of a wife and mother and there is nothing wrong with wanting your husband to see and appreciate you as a woman. Also concerns me he doesn't fill Stockings or anything when it's clear it's something you enjoy and I'm sure probably go above and beyond for your family with theirs. I'm so sorry this is happening. I would recommend talking to a therapist and see the best way to approach it. I find men (my guy included) seem to take our solutions (give me a more meaningful gift) to an issue as criticisms I.e. he immediately jumps to you're ungrateful and he will return the gifts when you're not try to convey that message.

He can put it in his office. \ud83d\ude01", "Nah one of those lawn mowers you have to push along that's not electric.", "This!!!", "Exactly. I didn\u2019t ask for this but I love cooking and got the most gorgeous set of copper-bottomed pots and pans years ago. Loved them and still do. So it was a very thoughtful gift for me specifically. But a cooler?? I don\u2019t know what that guy is thinking about but it definitely isn\u2019t his wife.", "My husband gets me super thoughtful gifts and sometimes they are home related. One Valentines I got a fancy robot vacuum ($700) and he does ALL of the maintenance...even after 4 years.\n\nFor our anniversary, he got me a specific sized rubber mallet for pounding chicken breasts. He made sure it could be easily sterilized and washed. He even drill the hole through the handle and put a loop on it so I could hang it on the wall. Those kind of gifts are thoughtful!\n\nRandom vacuum cleaners and pots and pans are crappy gifts unless it's a specific request is really rude.", "Totally. I kind of laughed reading this post because I told my partner I\u2019d like this nice dutch oven pot I\u2019ve been wanting. But it\u2019s something I\u2019m interested in and we also moved not long ago and are all about house stuff. Household items aren\u2019t necessarily a bad gift so long as it\u2019s something the person wants and would be excited to get.", "Yes! If it's a specific request or it's a fancy version of something they use for a task they genuinely enjoy doing, then a household item can be great. But just, \"You clean, so here's a vacuum\"?? Bad idea.\n\nFWIW, my sister and I bought my mom a fancy air fryer/toaster oven combo last year that she'd been talking about for MONTHS. She would never have bought it for herself because she had a toaster and had a basic air fryer already, and she's just too practical to buy something simply because she wants it. We found a sale, saved 30% on the price, and she was delighted by her gift. \n\nWhat was even better: the week we gave it to her, she was using the old basket-style air fryer to make tater tots or something and picked up the interior basket using its handle, only to have the bottom of the basket fall off and spill food everywhere. So she was doubly pleased because it was an appliance she didn't have to go out and replace herself AND it was a much better version than the one she already had. We looked like geniuses because of our timely gift. LOL", "I asked for a Dyson vacuum for Christmas about 10 years ago because I really wanted one. It\u2019s still going strong", "My ex's mom got me a pampered chef thing that breaks up ground beef while it cooks... so an overpriced specialty spatula... lol.  \n\nYeah, it was useful, but I couldn't stand her, and she still got thoughtful gifts from me. Thankfully, that whole family is far in the rear view mirror now. \n\nOp, NTA.", "Have things changed? I hope so, so much", "Yup. They're an illustration of the quality of brain doing that thinking. If you default to lazy thinking for gift giving, then you're defaulting to lazy thinking in your relationship too. The thought would matter if it were kind and personal. Treating your spouse as a household appliance? Yeah, not cool.", "That's the thing, though: this ISN'T thoughtful. \n\nHe wasn't thinking about his wife's interests or what would make her feel loved and appreciated. He was only thinking about her function in his life -- specifically, that she feeds and cleans up for the family. It's like he gave her a card addressed to \"my wife\" instead of her name and wrote, \"I hope you enjoy doing chores in the New Year\" instead of \"Merry Christmas\" or \"I love you.\" \n\nIt's basically letting OP know that he sees her as a resource instead of a person. That's the opposite of thoughtful, it's obtuse and hurtful.", "that one made me laugh out loud! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Pen and paper so he can take note from the kids.\n\nThis is the best gift idea yet!", "Trash bags so he can climb inside.", "She **could** be single and moving into her own home, because why stay with a man who doesn't seem to value you as a person or care enough to put actual thought into your gift?", "Agreed.\n\n>Christmas is for the kids this year if you have them.\n\nMy family did a secret Santa for the adults for many years, and we'd spoil the kids. These days there's no under 18s and the adults just don't bother. I love it. We all meet up a week before Christmas for a nice meal. That way everyone is free to do what they want for Christmas day. (we need to take ferries, and they're much less frequent on Christmas day).\n\nEdit: NTA", "Or a vacuum cleaner, mixer and a coffee pot.", "Poor dog having to live with someone who cares so little for it.
