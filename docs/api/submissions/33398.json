It was not a stocking filler. It was not a joke present.\n\nI'm pretty hard to buy for (I don't like useless tat, and I'm not the typical bathbomb gift set person) but I was still so upset. As a grown ass adult, I had to excuse myself to my room to cry.\n\nEveryone said they felt really bad and it's because \"I love cooking\" (which I do) and I'd been complaining about needing a new one (which I did) but I mean, a \u00a31.50 plastic spatula?\n\nI cook for my family out of love. I taught my nephew how to peel and chop vegetables - and in doing so, increased his confidence around food, which he is very picky about! I meticulously plan every meal so no one goes out of budget. I go to the shops every other day to buy the freshest fruit and veg.\n\nAnd bear in mind, I got this present after already spending all the previous evening AND that morning preparing the Christmas food. After I was done crying I went back in to the kitchen and cooked for nearly another couple of hours to finish everything up.\n\nAND, my presents were incredibly thoughtful.

Maybe you can tell him to make sure and buy you something personal or have a friend of his to put a big in his ear. Otherwise you will have to throw a fit and take them all back and buy yourself something you want. Or as other have stated buy him things the same way like toothpaste and toilet paper.

Learn to be grateful, not everyone is good at gift giving (these aren't even bad gifts if you actually needed them). Try to focus on other ways your husband shows love to you.

Get your husband things you'd like and then take them.", "I listened to my Mum complain about my Dad's presents for years, he always either forgot to buy anything, bought her stuff for the house, or stuff for himself but called it her gift. He really was pretty selfish about the whole thing. I'd like to tell you he changed but he never did. She's been gone for years now, but his new wife is experiencing the same problem. He's just a selfish arsehole who doesn't care about making other people happy.\n\nI did have similar issues with my partner to start with. He always said he didn't know what to buy. So now before every present gifting occasion we swap lists of what we want. Sure, I don't get surprises, but I do get nice gifts. His problem wasn't not caring just not knowing what to do. Now we're both happy with our gifts.\n\nSeeing as your kids even tried to get your partner to buy something else it sounds like you have a partner similar to my mother, one who sees gift giving as some obligation rather than trying to make you happy. Is he like this outside of present giving? Does he often put his wants and needs first? It sounds like he also sees the housework as your domain too. Does he contribute to the cleaning? Does he ever say or do nice things to make you happy? Or only contribute when he has to and then expect a party thrown because he \"helped\".\n\nIf yes to this, then you should re-think your relationship. You deserve to be with someone who wants to make you happy. Someone who thinks of you often. Someone who would realise that the house needed some new items and just get them.

You are something outside of a wife and mother and there is nothing wrong with wanting your husband to see and appreciate you as a woman. Also concerns me he doesn't fill Stockings or anything when it's clear it's something you enjoy and I'm sure probably go above and beyond for your family with theirs. I'm so sorry this is happening. I would recommend talking to a therapist and see the best way to approach it. I find men (my guy included) seem to take our solutions (give me a more meaningful gift) to an issue as criticisms I.e. he immediately jumps to you're ungrateful and he will return the gifts when you're not try to convey that message.
