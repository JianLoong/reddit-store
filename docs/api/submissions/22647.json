They always end up with *surprised Pikachu face* and it's fantastic", "This was my thought, as well.  \n\nIf the father was closeted as gay or bisexual at the time he married the mother, he was using the mother as a beard, to create a public image of being straight.  \n\nHappily, it is less common these days for this to happen than it was 20 or 30 years ago.\n\nBut it is a cruel thing, if the woman being married doesn't know she is being used this way.  It was not unusual, when this practice was common, for the husband to continue to have secret relationships, or even anonymous hook-ups, with other gay men.  Which made a lie of wedding vows made to the wife, promising fidelity.  \n\nIt also was a high-risk behavior where the wife never agreed to the risks the husband was taking.  This became an acute problem when AIDS first emerged, as it was demographically most common among gay men, and men and boys who had frequent blood treatments for hemophilia.  Women would find themselves with STDs, even a deadly untreatable one, when they believed they were avoiding risk by remaining faithful to their husband who was faithful to them in return.\n\n(I graduated high school in 1990.  There was one boy in my graduating class who had hemophilia.  He had to attend a separate gym class, to avoid even minor injuries, because even a bruise could require a treatment to prevent internal bleeding, and there was no way to test blood for HIV at that time.  The best they could do is try to screen the donor pool for higher-risk situations.)\n\nOP was young enough at the time of the divorce that neither parent would be likely to confide such issues in their child. (Nor should a child have to bear such secrets.)\n\nHeck, the risks to gay men who were discovered by the law were high enough that even Mister Rogers, in the early years of his show, advised Fran\u00e7ois Clemmons, who played \"Officer Clemmons\" to consider marrying a woman, for self-protection.  Punishments for men who were convicted of engaging in same-sex intercourse were severe, including prison and forced hormonal treatment in the form of \"chemical castration.\"  (Happily, Fred Rogers learned better over time.

Morally OP is definitely right, but there are a couple of problems in this scenario. First, abandoning someone is a pretty immature move (even though he deserved it). But more importantly, it was legally risky for OP to do that as he could have lost his permit leaving without him.\n\nWe all meet horrible people and interacting with them can be a challenge. But we have to keep our cool even when we're uncomfortable. I wouldn't go so far as to say OP was an AH, but he didn't make a good decision. He should have gone home and had a conversation about moving out and staying full time with his dad since mom clearly isn't prioritizing her son's well being in that household.", "\n\n\nThis made me cackle so much.\n\n>I told her even if they weren\u2019t with each other they wouldn\u2019t want to be with her.", "Ugh. Stop perpetuating this grossness. These homophobes are not \"mostly\" gay.", "This situation comes in a variety of ways and is never black and white.\n\nSome people truly discover later in life, after marrying and having kids, that they are in fact queer. They honestly didn't realize it before because sexuality is a spectrum and it works both ways some people can be gay but it's POSSIBLE for them to be aroused by the opposite sex. And arousel itself is not tied to attraction, it's more like a machine push the right buttons you'll get a result, doesn't matter who is pressing them. It's the entire basis of why men can be raped by women.\n\nOther queer people are raised where coming out as gay would end their life, for them it's a matter of life and death. For others the knowledge of complete osterization if they came made them feel pretending to be straight forever was a better option (and possible). Acceptance is a VERY new concept, only in the last decade or so has it truly become safe(ish) for queer people to be out. So for many when they married coming out was never an option and/or they were very young and at the time this seemed like the best course of action for them.\n\nYou can't label either party as \"wrong\" as each person was truly doing what they felt was right at the time.\n\nThe only real bad guy in these situations is the bigotry that forced people to make these unfair decisions.", "Bryan is the good stepdad, Joe is the homophobe stepdad.", "\"I did it because my stepfather was verbally abusing me\" is closer to it.", "Then OP should have gotten out of the car and called 911.", "Its like that saying, the difference in a straight man and a bisexual man is about a six pack.", "Yes and then there's homophobes who discriminate against gay men and aren't secretly closeted or misogynistic.", "If the kid was gonna make a habit of driving everywhere without an adult it\u2019s a problem .. one time to get out of a bad situation? It can slide. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s some deep problem, I\u2019d say the same thing if someone was unsafe and drove *one time* after having a few beers.", "I always felt like I was the only woman over the age of 20 who had never watched either of those movies (and never will!)\n\nThanks for making me feel better :P", "The message was fine, there was no need to add to it. You had to add in extra stuff and oppose a good advice for no reason. What OP did, at the age of 15 (this is important and I find it funny that in both occasions you don\u2019t see why that\u2019s important), was drive away without an adult while they are learning to drive. That\u2019s irresponsible since he wasn\u2019t in immediate danger and was just insulted (rightfully so, but still). What he should\u2019ve done was just ignore it long enough to get out of there.\n\nFunny, you ASSUMED WRONG! I HATE BOTH LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES (The far reaching ones)! Both are thee most spiteful and preachy mother fuckers I\u2019ve met, and talk about racist. I\u2019m a centralist that wants to actually make a change for the better. Liberals, while the better of the two, are very weak and spineless, they rarely get shit done and have a holier than though moment when we don\u2019t need it. That\u2019s what allowed Trump to fuck us over so badly. Then Conservatives, oh don\u2019t even get me started with them. Thee most hateful group I\u2019ve ever met, yet THEY don\u2019t mind being aggressive and getting their laws passed to screw us over, that\u2019s why our pay is so shit, yet no one wants to do anything meaningful about it. Liberals and conservatives always forget there\u2019s a middle ground to their bullshit. I know you\u2019re not a conservative because you talked about LGBT and Racism, and breaking norms. That\u2019s textbook liberal, conservatives are the opposite of that.", "SD was being hella verbally abusive.", "YTA him being an ass is not justification to leave him stranded and take his car. Plus, you\u2019re driving on a permit without a licensed adult. You could\u2019ve been arrested.", "NTA", "I\u2019m not condoning it but this is pretty reactionary. You don\u2019t know how much experience he has behind the wheel. My HS had a course where you could get your driver\u2019s license with less than 5 miles behind the wheel.

To me, it seems clear he was an ally back when people like us were very much still legally persecuted. I don't fault him for hiding Clemmons sexuality on his show or suggesting a beard as protection, though ideally he would have chosen a lesbian as his bride so they were both aware of the true purpose of their marriage and both benefitting from it. I don't speak for all of us, but for me personally I see an ally at a time when the concept of allies didn't even properly exist. I see an ally doing what he could to help and protect a gay man in a time that most would have been out for his blood instead. The world needs more Fred Rogers.", "I don\u2019t know why it is so shocking for people to realize, but bearding may have absolutely no place in this situation. Shocking for people to understand, but bisexual people are actually attracted to both sexes. He could\u2019ve just grown apart from her, as many married people do from their partners. And the next person he was attracted to was a man.", "He should take the nuclear option *when he and his belongings are safe*. Which basically means not till he's living with his dad and Bryan full-timw.", "You need to find yourself a pretty girl then!", "Lol what? Drinking and driving isn\u2019t remotely comparable to this situation, and your catastrophic hypothetical of hitting a mini bus full of kids is laughable hyperbole.

But try to picture a 15 year old totally convincing a cop that it's true, and not only that, but convincing him he was totally justified in taking off with his stepdad's car. Geez, there's a high chance the cop would agree with the stepdad's opinions. What happens then? Nothing good.\n\nWe should be giving a 15 year old advice that helps him (and others) be safe, not advice that feels good to us because an asshole got his comeuppance and that's all that matters.", "Of course we should. But if a cop asks, he should tell the truth, which is that his stepdad was being verbally abusive.", "Well that's all well and good theoretically, but it's unfortunately not how things actually work. Do you genuinely believe stepfather would have just accepted it when OP declined to get back in the car? Or would it exacerbate the situation and create a \\*more\\* unsafe situation for OP? (My money is on the latter.)\n\nAlso depending on the state, that may not be the case in terms of custody. There are some states who do not take the child's preferences into account at all because of an, in my opinion misguided, attempt to not cause undue stress on the child by putting them in the middle of the court proceedings. Whether the kid is 4 or 17. And if OP refuses to go unilaterally, mom and stepdad can go to the court and make the argument that dad is not following and enforcing the parenting plan, which could jeopardize OP's time with dad as it is. (Source: my state is like this.)"]}
