I got my permit last month and my dad and Bryan  have  been teaching me how to drive. My mom thought it'd be a great idea to have Joe try to teach me so we could bond.

I told him that and he goes on  this rant about how he probably knows better and he's trying to keep me from ending up like Bryan and my dad. I asked what he meant by that and he tells me like a sissy and that I needed  to man up.  We had to pull over for gas. I was pissed so after we filled up and he went in to get something I drove off and left him there. I went home and I ignored his calls. He ended having to get an uber home. To say that my mom and him were pissed is an understatement. \n\nI  told her what he'd said and she told me that was no reason to do something like that and grounded me.

Both parts are bad, but to focus on the second: It\u2019s unacceptable for a stepparent to try to poison a child against their parents in general, and it\u2019s unacceptable to be a toxic and homophobic person enforcing a toxic version of masculinity on anyone\u2014and especially on a child they\u2019re helping to raise.
