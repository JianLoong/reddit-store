Obviously something is going on with the 12 year old that requires some form of therapy. Poop everywhere? This is not normal. This is not ok.\n\nWhile I understand wanting to step back, I think its important to reassure the 12 year old that she is loved, your house is a safe space, and she can tell you anything. But this behavior is not ok. \n\nYou mentioned this started about 4 years ago? And your bio child is 4 years old? Was she an only child before? And is she an only child at her moms? Is it possible she is seeking attention even if it is negative? \n\nShe\u2019s approaching some delicate years and it\u2019s certainly urgent to get this addressed ASAP. Honestly, ESH as it sounds like this years long issue still has yet to be resolved. But I applaud you for your love and concern for your bonus daughter.", "Some questions:\n1- does she do this at school? Is it something that school has been calling/asking about? Because if it is something a teacher notices, bathroom difficulties (especially psychological, as this seems to be) are often a sign of sexual abuse that teachers will absolutely report to CPS\u2026 so that might be an imputas for getting husband and bio mom and step mom onboard getting her help. \n\n2- it seems from your description that this started around the same time as your son was born\u2026 there\u2019s probably something to that! \n\n3- if the parents have joint custody, dad needs to have her medical info (what if you took her on a vacation and she got hurt or something\u2026 you would need that info)! You should talk to a family attorney about it if she is uncommunicative.\n\n4- you could step back, if you are sure that the other adults in her life are going to catch her. If you are not sure, then you would be the AH for abandoning her. You should, however, set some boundaries with her (she can handle it) and all 4 of you need to sit down, with her, and talk about making things as consistent as possible across households. This might be a sign that she is feeling out of control of her life\u2026 and what she can control is where and how she poops.", "As a former forensic interviewer, my mind instantly went to sexual abuse as a possibility. I would talk to her therapist and see if you need a referral to a children\u2019s advocacy center. Sudden onset of bathroom issues in an otherwise neurotypical and otherwise healthy child can be a result of severe trauma.", "ESH.\nIt\u2019s hard to actually judge because something HAS to be going on with the 12 year old. It\u2019s not normal behaviour. \n\nI don\u2019t blame you for wanting to step back. And I actually would agree that you do for the time being. Let your husband figure it out, if need be put locks on doors etc so no poo gets on personal stuff. \n\nYour SO needs to step up, so does your BD\u2019s mom.", "NTA- bio mom is for not helping the situation at all.  Daughter has something going on for sure, most likely its very much mental then actual physical. the fact she can hide it and isnt pooping in front of people shows its not physical.\n\nFor your own mental health, get yourself some therapy too, because wow. Dad really needs to step up and start getting some answers from his ex, this is on HIM.    \nI do wonder if she does this at school too or just at home.. It could also be things happening while she is with bio mom. Whatever it is, it was something big that happened to her.\n\nThe hiding of it, well she isnt doing it for attention.", "ESH\n\nThe Mom needs to be paying for therapy. I doubt she is lazily pooping her pants because the wiping and hiding it takes longer than walking to the bathroom and taking care of business. She clearly has something going on, and perhaps needs disposable underwear until this is resolved. Just because it's not medical doesn't mean she's *lazy*.\n\nYou're in or you're not. You can't take steps back from biological minor children without being seen as a garbage parent. The 12 year old is a CHILD. I get that what you're dealing with is frustrating, but chewing out a 12y/o isn't going to make things better. \n\nI've known MULTIPLE kids with this similar problem. Not an epidemic level, but it's not a rare thing.\n\nIf you want to leave, then leave. If you plan to stay, you need to be all in and look at this as something you need to help the 12y/o through. \n\nThe person you should chew out is Dad. Have him take mom to court over the situation. She clearly needs therapy, and if mom won't, Dad needs the info so you two can set it up.", "Been in this situation. Has she been tested for encropresis? Something traumatic happened and it's affected her this way.\n\nWhile it could be sa like comment below says, for us it was a divorce that triggered it and for a friend's child  it was too aggressive potty training.\n\nHas her colon been xrayed?", "NTA. You did your best, but her dad needs to handle this.  He's being neglectful if he keeps ignoring it.  How is she not embarrassed at her age? Have you spoken with her school? Is she doing this there as well? Perhaps they can encourage the bio-mom to do something. If I were a mandated reporter, I would definitely see this as abuse/neglect if a kid was in school every day with crapped pants and the parents were seemingly oblivious. \n\nYou're in a no-win situation as a step-parent. Whether you handle it or ignore it, you're going to be blamed for doing too much or not enough.", "This isn\u2019t a job for a therapist. It\u2019s a job for a psychiatrist and a psychologist. \n\nAnd I hate to say it but as several others have pointed out this \u2018poop\u2019 reaction is not uncommon with minors being raped.", "ESH. this girl clearly has huge problems. You should be WORRIED about her! All of the adults in her life are letting her down.", "Yeah no, dad should have whatever medical information or records via court like ages ago", "I think, in a way, ESH.\n\nIt's a really tough situation to judge though honestly. No 12 year old would intentionally hide poop for no reason, whether that be a physical issue or a emotional/mental one.\n\nThe bottom line is, both parents need to address this now. Not later, not next week but yesterday. Get a therapist or a doctor. If they can't diagnose a reason, get a new one - don't give up. Who cares who but someone needs to figure out WHY. It's causing distress for everyone but probably more so for the 12 year old.\n\nI'm not saying no one has tried but keep trying.

You married dad,. That doesn't automatically make you her mother. There is a serious problem here but it isn't the poop. That's a symptom of something else. The fact she goes to great lengths to hide it tells me she is only receiving punishment. With zero support from her family. She NEEDS therapy regardless of who or how it's paid for. \n\nShe has no respect for you because you are not her parent.

It was definitely a good idea to get her in therapy because something else is certainly going on. I wish her bio parents were more concerned like you.

NTA.\n\nI have a mentally challenged uncle and there was a time that he was refusing to wipe after pooping, and then went on to wear the same underwear for days. Are you sure there's no diagnosis for her condition?\n\nOther than that, the only possibilities I can think is that this is reaction to trauma or, and this may sound weird, but maybe she has developed a kink?", "Does she only do this at your house?", "NTA\u2026.this also might have been a way she started protecting herself because she was abused and they wouldn\u2019t abuse her with poop around. \n\nBut this is a pretty severe thing to be hiding feces around the house. \n\nI don\u2019t know what you can do but protect your other child.", "Came here to say the say thing. I used to not wipe myself because any touch there was horrifying and the things that went through my mind\u2026 it was bad. Also she\u2019s actively hiding it, which suggests shame more than being indifferent. If she put soiled pants in the washing hamper with everything else, then you could say she didn\u2019t care, but she\u2019s hiding it. She may have a fully functioning gastrointestinal system, but that girls mind is not right. \n\nAsk her one question: How do you feel when you wipe yourself? \n\nLet her know that you will believe whatever she says to you about how you feel because you love her and want her to feel ok and not have to worry about hiding the soiled pants.

I hope we are both wrong.", "Came here to say almost the same thing. The two children that I've known with poop problems both turned out to have been molested. I know that's not the only possible reason, but it's a red flag for me.\n\nI know, I know, if I had a nickel for every time this happened, I'd have two nickles.

This is something else more behavioral.", "She was an only child, yes. We believed for a long time it was about attention, but when she started hiding it to the point we wouldnt ever find, unless we looked REAL hard, I started to question how that is seeking attention? You dont want us to find it...\n\nThat 4 year mark is also when her mom got with a women. And also when her grandmother got lung cancer.

Plus the unsanitary aspect of it had me squirming in my seat, no wonder OP is at her wits end with that. \n\nI'd be numbering her underwear and keeping track to make sure none are missing. If some are, then look for them without shaming her until the cause is found out.", "She's clearly got something on, and I don't think the pooping and lying are two different problems. Her bio Mom seems in denial, and isn't getting her help.\n\nPerhaps she fears that it reflects badly on her that her daughter has this kind of problem at this age, and therefore doesn't want to admit to herself that there's an issue... because maybe she knows that she had a hand in it.

Example (and trigger warning for the rest of this), being naked was awful for me, so I used to only pretend to shower by splashing water on my face and feet and let the shower run so it looked like I showered, but I\u2019d also often wear the same underwear for days and sometimes get dressed over my pyjamas so I didn\u2019t have to be naked. On the other hand, sometimes I took multiple showers a day and scrubbed my skin until it was raw. I couldn\u2019t look in a mirror and dressed very modestly for a little girl, I wanted baggy clothes from a young age and did everything to be invisible or ugly (not shaving my legs, brushing my hair, or plucking my eyebrows). And I felt fine hugging my parents but if I smelled alcohol on them I\u2019d get agitated and couldn\u2019t have physical contact with anyone who smelled of alcohol. I wasn\u2019t able to do more than a high five with anyone else, I couldn\u2019t have a hug if I was laying down or sitting on a bed. These are some very specific things to my situation, but my therapist told me some of these were common. I wasn\u2019t able to express myself at that age - around the same as your daughter is now. And because things happened to me when I was still so young, everyone just assumed that\u2019s just how I was. You might need to do some bonding type things with her and pretend to like stuff you don\u2019t so she feels comfortable and safe to open up to you (if something has happened), but just go gentle with her and the rest of your family - including yourself.", "Take her to a doctor", "Agreed, agreed, agreed.

BIG IF. It IS her bio dad, she may be scared you would take his side or not believe her at all.. this unfortunately happens\u2026 a lot and sadly is not out of the question.

Occasionally there are medical reasons, or if they are autistic or have other disabilities sometimes there are issues of hyposensitivity, where they literally struggle to be aware of the sensations of having to go to the bathrooms (related to many of the same sensory issues that cause hypersensitivity with regards to other things like smell or taste).\n\nBut I'm genuinely shocked that when OP found out that there were no obvious medical reasons that they didn't immediately take her for counselling or a psych eval. \n\n8 years old (around the age she started doing this), is old enough that while an \"accident\" is always a possibility, the sheer EMBARRASSMENT and risk of bullying if they were caught or even from the smell that would follow her around would keep any child this age that I know from doing it even once, much less on a regular basis.\n\nBut kids who have been SA'ed will not only do this, they'll do it deliberately to MAKE themselves smelly and unattractive, to keep a predator from wanting to come near them. It's the same principle that makes victims gain copious amounts of weight. It's a trauma response. If, God forbid, she has been sexually assaulted anally, she may also not have full control of her anal sphincter. You say that there's no obvious sign of medical issues, but . . . I'm sorry, my parents were literally trained to recognise SA because of their jobs and still had no idea throughout my childhood what had happened to me. There aren't always obvious signs, or sometimes they appear to be something else (GI issues, etc.).\n\nWhat is going on with this kid SCREAMS SA. Again, no child that age shits themselves for YEARS out of \"laziness\". That just isn't a thing.

Or at least callousness. The disgust you must feel. And you know that's coming from a hurting child, whatever the hurt is coming from. It sounds like you're caring and trying to do what's best. I wish you both much strength.", "The court system", "it is certainly concerning. Maybe the bio mom needs to see a therapist too if its a sudden lifestyle change and nothing is physically wrong with her.  \n\n\nAny way, you are great for your concern regarding your stepdaughter and I really hope you figure something out and she's able to get the help she needs.  \n\n\nGood luck!", "Do you feel like they will stop up or just let  it continue? \n\nWhat does the school say about it? Is there a counselor there she can talk and meet with once a week that\u2019s trustworthy? With school starting up again so soon and having multiple classes kids will notice if they haven\u2019t already. \nI hate to say it but kids are ruthless in middle school at least it was that way for me. Especially girls. They see that one thing and just zero in on it. The peer pressure from other kids knowing might make your bonus daughter want to change what she\u2019s been doing or it\u2019ll make it worse. Just something to keep an eye out for and talk to the school about. But again bio parents should be doing that. \n\nThat is an odd comment for bio mom to make regarding being a lesbian. Maybe she just knew how was the time but only she knows why she is with the person she is with now.", "DCF handles medicaid, so if you have to change your address you have to call them. You just call and say you\u2019re noncustodial parent and you need her Medicaid information. They will help you with this, it\u2019s different than making a DCF report.", "Therapy is extremely expensive and often not effective. It sucks that 11 visits yielded no solution, but isn\u2019t surprising at all.", "Seems like some authorities may need to get involved here, since the parents are not taking the needed actions.", "mental health can be treated by medicine", "This situation is untenable. You don't have her Medicaid info? What happens if she has a medical emergency? Honestly there are so many ways in which this situation could end badly, your husband needs to understand this and you two prepare yourselves for them. Any teacher, doctor, or other adult who found out about this could make a CPS report for suspected abuse. I am not a lawyer but I am extremely worried for you and your family. Start documenting everything, especially her mom's refusal to get her medical or mental health treatment or to provide you the insurance information so that you can get her care. That may already qualify as neglect, and might also be an indication that she knows there is abuse happening and doesn't want anyone who might file a report to find out.", "Thank you so much! It is absolutely soul crushing and I feel so alone half the time. Like im the only one its affecting this way. \n\nAnd yes, 100% feel malice and spite, directed at them and directed at me, from her. Maybe I sometimes forget shes hurting too and probably lashing out at me, because I know somethings wrong.", "You happen to know where I could get the money for a lawyer? Cause I honestly have no clue. My account doesnt have it. Neither does dads \ud83d\ude29 Money, life's biggest struggle", "Im not against who shes with. It just so happened to be another big changes in my daughters life. If shes happy, than that amazing! But shes also put on about 200 lbs, so its kind of confusing on our end.\n\nI do plan to talk with the school, atleast to get her in seeing their counselor again. She went a few times last year, cant hurt to keep going, along side an actual therapist. \n\nWe have had the same thoughts about people at school finding out... maybe it would help!!! But maybe it would do the exact opposite. Such a hard position to be in.", "Oh really??? I have never heard of this! Definitely sounds like a good route!!!", "I 100% believe she should still be going, but for the summer, she is at her moms during the week. I plan to start it back up when school starts.... although paying it alone is extremly hard.", "Not this kind of thing", "There's a helpful saying child psychologists use: \"all behaviour is communication.\" She's communicating extreme distress. I'm so sorry you feel so alone in this. Everyone around should be rallying around. Please get in touch with services for yourself too. Even to speak to the Samaritans at least. It's so hard being the adult. But you are an adult and you know something is wrong. Recruit other adults, for her AND for you. You count too. Don't step back from her, but remember you deserve support too.", "There is something called covert incest. And even a Bio mom can be an abuser. This girl needs help. Desperately.", "Well, where do you live? That would tell me what options that you have. Particularly for low cost family lawyers. \n\nDid your partner ever get a formal custody arrangement?", "There are family lawyers who work on a sliding scale. But your husband needs to start googling for them, like, yesterday - as you can guess, they're often booked up.", "Well I wish you nothing  but the best and I hope everything works out. Just know you\u2019re doing the best you can and hopefully  your bonus daughter realizes how much you\u2019re on her side.", "Be prepared to wait forever\u2026 call early like 8am, and have all your questions written down. They will hang up. It\u2019s a PIA.", "I get that, but the conclusion that she is fine but lazy can\u2019t reasonably be based on several weeks of therapy and a gastroenterologist saying no problems are found.", "what a weird place to find a psychiatrist.", "Thank you so much for your kind words. It means the world", "Who are the Samaritans?", "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "Thank you so much! I will definitely be doing this!", "Its more based on the many ER trips, than anything. And the diagnosis from the therapist. Maybe lazy is the wrong word.  Maybe its more she doesnt care? Idk. Ive never pooped in my pants, so its a hard thing to get on that level"]}
