She died 8 months later. The 8 months before her death she begged dad to do some stuff without his wife and stepdaughter and give her some memories of us together with our mom and him. He agreed. His stepdaughter was 6 at the time and knew us most of her life so I know she was confused when she no longer saw my sister at all and then was told she died. Not to mention why the man she called dad was gone so much. My dad wanted my sister to let his wife and stepdaughter be at her bedside with the rest of the family but she said they weren't her family and refused. She died with me, mom, dad and our grandparents at her side. \n\nRight after my sister died my dad and I had a huge falling out. He wanted me to move in with him and he wanted me to shower his stepdaughter with the same love I showered my sister with. He told me I needed to be her big brother for real now because it was going to be a lot for her. I told him I would never feel the same for her as I did my sister and I did not want to pretend I cared about her at that time. He told me I owed them all (he included his wife in that) because I was the last sibling left and needed to make up for my sister shutting stepsister out at the end of her life. Dad and I did not talk after our argument until he reached out three months ago.\n\nIt started with him wanting to know how I was doing but then he told me how his stepdaughter missed me and my sister and how she'd struggled with not saying goodbye to \"her sister\" and why she didn't get to see her before she died, why she had nothing of hers to hold onto. How she asked a lot about why I wasn't around anymore. He asked me to talk to her and tell her that my sister had wanted to see her and to help her believe that she was loved and wanted by her and that my sister asked for her a lot at the end. I told him I would not lie for him. He snapped at me and said I owed her this much when I abandoned her just like my sister had for no other reason than she wasn't our bio sister and wasn't enough for us to love.

It\u2019s hard, and it\u2019s unfortunate for her, but it\u2019s not your fault. Trying to blend families does not always work and that\u2019s okay.", "NTA", "I think this is beyond our paygrade.\n\nI'm sure Stepsis didn't understand why she was being kept away from your Sis at the end of her life.  She might indeed have been hurt that there was a difference between the relationship between the two of you.\n\nYour Sister can't be blamed for how she felt.  The people she wanted there at the end were who they were.\n\nYour Dad was trying to navigate the needs of his dying child - the worst thing anyone can go through emotionally - vs. those of the young Stepchild who wasn't going anywhere and would be around after everything was over.\n\nYou lost your Sister.  With all due respect, that's worse than anything your Stepsis was going through.\n\nIf you're willing, I think you and Dad need to get family counselling.", "NTA, but don't let your Dad drive you away from the step, you may eventually want a relationship with her. He's the one that's insecure.", "NTA. What even is the logic that you *owe* your stepsister a certain relationship. That makes zero sense, and demanding it while you are grieving is a MASSIVE AH move. \n\nShe was 6! Sure, it will be a bit sad, but she wouldn't feel like she'd lost a close relationship if her parents didn't push the idea she ever had one. A distant relationship with a large age gap is normal, step aspect notwithstanding.", "NTA- Your dad and his current wife could have explained in a very age- appropriate manner to SD why she was not with your sister when sister died.     Your dad has botched this from beginning to end by not telling the truth to begin with.  He made this mess and needs to clean it up with his step-daughter.", "NTA.  This kind of lie will only cause more pain for her down the line.", "Dude, your dad is an ass but you might wanna check yourself a tad here \nStep knew your sister as HER sister, you view her as you want but that's how she views you both and at 6 she was told her sister died THEN her brother abandoned her, regardless of how everything happened nothing was her fault and knowing her sister disliked her so much she didnt even want to see her before she passed WILL mess her up, she doesnt sound like a bad kid and a small white lie wont hurt her as deep as the truth will, just do something nice for a kid ay?", "INFO \n\nHow old were you when your sister died and you had the falling out with your dad?", "NTA. My condolences for the loss of your sister. The only good thing I can tell about your father is that he honored the wish of your dying sister. You owe this person nothing.", "The can be the same, but parents can not force it to be the same.  And if parents push it it is almost guarunteed to fail.  You gotta let the kids set the pace and tone", "Do not talk about my Rice Krispies like that", "I don\u2019t get why you\u2019re saying OP is being \u201cdishonest\u201d to a small child. OP\u2019s dad is asking him to be dishonest and lie to the child but OP refused. \n\nOP\u2019s sister\u2019s literal dying wish was to not have to see the stepmother or stepsister. There\u2019s no way that should be told to a small child. It\u2019s better if they don\u2019t see each other.", "Since people don\u2019t start forming memories until they\u2019re a few years old, to that little girl, you had been her siblings her entire life, and she probably loved you both as such. Then you abandoned her without explaining anything, and she never even got to say goodbye to \u2018her\u2019 big sister before she died. \n\nYou didn\u2019t need to treat her or love her like your biological sister, but your actions have been unnecessarily hurtful to a little girl. You could have done better, instead you were cruel. \n\nESH", "Sorry, my wording was unclear. I meant the father was the one being dishonest, not OP. The father is clearly the bigger asshole here, but unceremoniously casting off a small child that sees you as family and who just lost someone else they see as family... I'm sorry that just doesn't sit with me. Does that mean they have to act like they love her? No, of course not, but that doesn't preclude a little empathy.", "What a perfect analogy! Family therapists should have this on their walls.", "Great imagery.  Am now getting a sack and second cat so my cat Experiences The Love!", "I get that the step sister is probably innocent in all this, but I think if anyone is guilty it's the dad. If the dad didn't push OP to treat her the same, then they wouldn't have had a falling out. Also OP isn't saying he wants to never see her again, he just told his dad he would not lie.", "Disagree. OP was also a child when this first went down. Expecting him to replace his dead sister with his step-sister was a terrible burden to place on him.\n\nCalling him up now and trying to guilt him into being a part of the step-sister's life ... is another terrible thing his father is doing. \n\nOP - NTA\n\nI'm sorry your dad keeps hurting you and your step-sister. I don't know how to fix that for her. You should talk to your mom about not taking his calls any more. Have you ever talked to a grief therapist? It might be worth a trip or two, just to help with some of what you're experiencing.", "She was never their sibling. She was the stepmother's daughter. Some times it happens that way and trying to force a relationship never does anyone any good.", "Here, I made the poster for you. https://imgur.com/a/ZRlwg3E", "Love it! Calico kittens are the best!", "They're so cute \ud83d\ude0d"]}
