She died 8 months later. The 8 months before her death she begged dad to do some stuff without his wife and stepdaughter and give her some memories of us together with our mom and him. He agreed. His stepdaughter was 6 at the time and knew us most of her life so I know she was confused when she no longer saw my sister at all and then was told she died. Not to mention why the man she called dad was gone so much. My dad wanted my sister to let his wife and stepdaughter be at her bedside with the rest of the family but she said they weren't her family and refused. She died with me, mom, dad and our grandparents at her side. \n\nRight after my sister died my dad and I had a huge falling out. He wanted me to move in with him and he wanted me to shower his stepdaughter with the same love I showered my sister with. He told me I needed to be her big brother for real now because it was going to be a lot for her. I told him I would never feel the same for her as I did my sister and I did not want to pretend I cared about her at that time. He told me I owed them all (he included his wife in that) because I was the last sibling left and needed to make up for my sister shutting stepsister out at the end of her life. Dad and I did not talk after our argument until he reached out three months ago.\n\nIt started with him wanting to know how I was doing but then he told me how his stepdaughter missed me and my sister and how she'd struggled with not saying goodbye to \"her sister\" and why she didn't get to see her before she died, why she had nothing of hers to hold onto. How she asked a lot about why I wasn't around anymore. He asked me to talk to her and tell her that my sister had wanted to see her and to help her believe that she was loved and wanted by her and that my sister asked for her a lot at the end. I told him I would not lie for him. He snapped at me and said I owed her this much when I abandoned her just like my sister had for no other reason than she wasn't our bio sister and wasn't enough for us to love.
