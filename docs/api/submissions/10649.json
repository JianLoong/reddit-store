I was so excited until I saw the dress I\u2019d have to wear. It wasn\u2019t flattering at all. But for my Aunt I was willing to compromise. The night before the party I drank way too much alcohol at a friend\u2019s party. I had a bad hangover and almost canceled. But my mom was able to help me and relieve my symptoms. I was fine during the wedding ceremony but at the reception afterwards I went downhill. I was able to get a beverage from the bar despite being only 16 and I guess my body wasn\u2019t fully recovered from the night before. I felt terrible after drinking the beer and ended up throwing up all over my dress. Everyone went dead silent and looked totally shocked. My mom swooped in and took me to the bathroom to wash off. I had a stain on my dress but besides that I was able to clean up nicely. The rest of the night I just sat with my mom. Almost everyone who came by asked how I was doing. The rest of the night went well and I felt like the wedding was a success. But the next morning my aunt chewed me out. She said she was so disappointed and that she regretted making me a bridesmaid. According to her me getting sick took the attention off her and her husband and she had people asking about me all night. I feel like my aunt is taking the whole thing out of proportion and she is being ungrateful that I agreed to be a bridesmaid and wore that hideous dress.", "created_utc": 1677090112, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119707c/aita_for_stealing_the_spotlight_at_my_aunts/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you don\u2019t know how you react to any drugs, don\u2019t do them.

Stop before it becomes full blown alcoholism.", "YTA. You shouldn\u2019t have drank, especially since you can\u2019t handle your alcohol (drinking too much the night before, puking, etc). You made a public scene by throwing up all over your dress, in front of everyone.\n\nWhat does a hideous dress have to do with you being immature and irresponsible?", "YTA.  Not sure if this a dumb rookie drinker mistake or a budding alcoholic move.  Either way, I would advice OP seriously evaluate their actions here and offer a genuine apology.", "Oh you\u2019re definitely TA.

You wanted to go out and drink but you had obligations. Next time consider your obligations before your wants if you want others to respect you. \nEdit a word\nAlso please take care of yourself.
