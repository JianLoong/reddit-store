I was so excited until I saw the dress I\u2019d have to wear. It wasn\u2019t flattering at all. But for my Aunt I was willing to compromise. The night before the party I drank way too much alcohol at a friend\u2019s party. I had a bad hangover and almost canceled. But my mom was able to help me and relieve my symptoms. I was fine during the wedding ceremony but at the reception afterwards I went downhill. I was able to get a beverage from the bar despite being only 16 and I guess my body wasn\u2019t fully recovered from the night before. I felt terrible after drinking the beer and ended up throwing up all over my dress. Everyone went dead silent and looked totally shocked. My mom swooped in and took me to the bathroom to wash off. I had a stain on my dress but besides that I was able to clean up nicely. The rest of the night I just sat with my mom. Almost everyone who came by asked how I was doing. The rest of the night went well and I felt like the wedding was a success. But the next morning my aunt chewed me out. She said she was so disappointed and that she regretted making me a bridesmaid. According to her me getting sick took the attention off her and her husband and she had people asking about me all night. I feel like my aunt is taking the whole thing out of proportion and she is being ungrateful that I agreed to be a bridesmaid and wore that hideous dress.", "created_utc": 1677090112, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119707c/aita_for_stealing_the_spotlight_at_my_aunts/", "score": 577, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stop before it becomes full blown alcoholism.", "YTA. You shouldn\u2019t have drank, especially since you can\u2019t handle your alcohol (drinking too much the night before, puking, etc). You made a public scene by throwing up all over your dress, in front of everyone.\n\nWhat does a hideous dress have to do with you being immature and irresponsible?", "YTA.  Not sure if this a dumb rookie drinker mistake or a budding alcoholic move.  Either way, I would advice OP seriously evaluate their actions here and offer a genuine apology.", "Oh you\u2019re definitely TA. I was on the fence until you said \u201cshe is being ungrateful that I agreed to be a bridesmaid and wore that hideous dress.\u201d", "YTA You got drunk the night before, and you're underage.

You wanted to go out and drink but you had obligations. Next time consider your obligations before your wants if you want others to respect you. \n\nEdit a word \n\nAlso please take care of yourself.

You also let everyone know how you will be when you are in weddings. I don\u2019t blame your aunt for being upset. I\u2019m sure this is the last time she will have you in any thing.", "YTA- after reading your profile.", "Just go ahead and say no next time someone asks you to be in their wedding. You'd still be an asshole for puking on yourself but you'd be a bit more anonymous.", "YTA", "Wow. OP has a lot of growing up to do. Hope there\u2019s not much more collateral damage on the way\u2026\n\nYour aunt has every right to be upset with you. \n\nYTA", "YTA-- this wasn't a stomach bug, this was the direct result of your actions. You knew you had an event and responsibilities when you drank to excess, you knew you were still suffering from said excess when you drank at the wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough whoever gave a sixteen year old booze at the wedding sounds like a second A, because your wording leads me to believe you're under the legal drinking age where you live.", "YTA.  J*sus.", "Yeah. You had to know getting drunk the night before the wedding was s bad idea. YTA", "YTA. So you got wasted at a friends party even though you\u2019re under aged right before the wedding that you\u2019re supposed to be in. So much so that you threw up on your bridesmaid dress during the reception? What is wrong with you? Of course you\u2019re the asshole. \n\nThis kind of behavior is absolutely outrageous and you\u2019re old enough to know better. You are, however not old enough to be drinking. Clearly you can\u2019t handle the responsibility. I feel awful for your aunt, and you owe her a gigantic apology.", "Sixteen year olds", "So glad I didn\u2019t have to scroll at all to find this. Thank you", "A teenager. Lol", "I knew someone who did. They\u2019re no longer friends with the bride. \ud83d\ude02", "And then drinks at the reception. And she doesn\u2019t think she did anything wrong. YTA OP.", "Lol what?", "And she thinks the aunt should be grateful! Total AH.", "Tbf that's the only legit hangover cure", "OP doesn't understand that from now on she's going to be watched and gossiped about whenever she goes for a drink at family functions. At 16 she's already labeled as the alcoholic family member who can't control themselves and to not have her in any position of importance less something like this happens again.", "Their teenage bridesmaid who's vomiting because they've been binge drinking. That's not embarrassing at all to have a bunch of adults at your wedding watch that /s", "Also the mom is a even bigger AH for enabling her alcoholic daughter YTA", "In some countries 16 is the legal drinking age. No where does it say that it\u2019s the US.", "I\u2019m also looking dead at the parents. Your daughter was hung over to the point that she was almost not able to stand up and be a bridesmaid the way that she was committed to and somehow she managed to get herself over to the bar and get a drink when she still wasn\u2019t fully recovered? At 16? The adults on her life have really failed her.", "It's like AH's enjoy being called AH's so much they keep coming back for more.", "Hee Hee  I love how you dragged your mother by agreeing that drinking before marrying her was the right thing to do.  High five.", "lol right? I feel like most commenters haven't been to many weddings. still YTA but it's more like who DOESN'T get wasted the night before a wedding? \n\nGroomsmen are usually the worst offenders. I can't even think of the last wedding I went to without wasted groomsmen.", "Youre being downvoted by babies lol.  Rehearsal dinners can get fkn WILD, but maybe thats just my family \ud83e\udd23", "lol yeah I agree that it's YTA but literally everyone gets drunk the night before a wedding. \n\nI'm a \"one or two drinks\" kind of person so I'm always still sober while everyone else is acting like an idiot. \n\nand also pretty much every wedding I've been to has had groomsmen that are just utterly wasted and can barely stand because they just drink all day while the bride and bridesmaids get ready.", "This!!", "That's funny because I've heard the opposite argument that European kids don't get super drunk to the point of being sick since they've had alcohol since they were 5 or whatever and they \"know their limits.\" \n\nI'm not super patriotic but yeah I am glad I live in a place where it's socially unacceptable for children to get so drunk that they throw up all over themselves at family events.", "Just giving my opinion", "There is probably gonna be a Europe/USA divide over whether OP is just being a kid or whether she is one drink away from an AA meeting.", "There are but this isn\u2019t one. OP said they were able to get a drink from the bar despite being only 16 meaning they were below the limit.", "Mum might not have wanted to disappoint the aunt by having their irresponsible daughter drop out of being a bridesmaid at literally the last minute. \nIf she was only a guest, yeah leave her home (though frankly that sounds like a reward at this point), but she was in the bridal party. Mum should make her wear the unflattering bridesmaid dress to Prom tho", "Mom was in damage control mode. She was trying to limit the impact of OP\u2019s poor judgement on the bride and groom as much she could, by attempting to restore one of their bridesmaids to functional on the day of the wedding, and then whisking her away and attempting to clean her up at the wedding itself. She saw that bride and groom\u2019s day was more important in this instance and tried to mitigate. \n\nNow that the wedding is over, I am sure that OP will be getting more than an earful from mom, who was doubtless embarrassed and angry that she had to do any of it in the first place, rather than just being able to enjoy her sister\u2019s wedding. I mean, really, do we think that mom actually WANTED to clean barf off of her teenage daughter\u2019s dress (that she, mom, doubtless paid for)? Or that she wanted to sit there with her nauseous, hung over, smelling-of-vomit daughter keeping an eye on her rather than dancing or socializing with her family?  \n\nOP should be kissing mom\u2019s feet and apologizing profusely to everyone.", "Back in my day, which wasn\u2019t that long ago, underage drinking was fairly common in America.\n\nI didn\u2019t participate, well I did in college, but in high school I heard the other kids talk about it all the time.", "Tbf me and my friends were drinking at events at 16. Usually we made an attempt to hide it from our parents, but at a wedding or a funeral my older friends and cousins were def getting us drinks. Or we had our own stashed somewhere. My age group went hard with the partying and you see some of Gen z pushing back against that teenage stereotype", "I used to know a family who would happily send their 15 year old off to a party with a six pack of wine coolers, because it was 'to share', even though all the kids were bringing their own 6 packs or bottles, but at the same time wouldn't let her stay home alone if they were going out for the night because 'she's only 15, what if something happens.'", "I\u2019m Australia. My parents would have been LIVID if I got so drunk the night before a family wedding that I could not honour my commitments.", "Americans are guilty of it as well. I was the only kid in my graduating class who\u2019d never gone to a party, done drugs (cocaine was big around those parts\u2026), drank often, etc. I was considered a weirdo by everyone for it, even my fellow oddball/outcast friends \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "A rose is a rose is a rose.", "I feel like that is a very old law that just was never removed lol", "Actually, scientifically a hangover is best understood as mild alcohol withdrawal, so technically drinking more /should/ (obviously not in this case) make you feel better b/c adding the substance you are experiencing withdrawal symptoms from should ease symptoms\u2026 That said, obviously drinking when you already feel ill is a horrid idea, and curing alcohol withdrawal with more alcohol is a worse one.", "She's lucky she didn't give herself alcohol poisoning if she's hitting the drinks that hard.", "Preach!  There's an excuse for every bad behavior so nobody ever has to take any accountability for anything.  Then people wonder why this world is so messed up.", "agreed", "Im from the US and did TONS of stupid shit like this. No public barfing but definitely binge drank at socially inappropriate times etc. You don't know your limits at 16 and have a terrible gauge of risk (that psychology and neurology prove). I think there are too many prudes on here that pretend they've never done anything uncouth in their lives. It's better to make mistakes and learn from them young. But in this court of public opinion everyone's an addict or a cheater to them and none of them have ever been close with someone of the opposite sex. I feel sad for people who have led such sheltered lives", "My grandmother and great uncle were very functional alcoholics.

Cause no, that is not normal behavior, even for an irresponsible 16 yo", "Beer is alcoholic, last time I checked.", "No one in my family ever made comments and the one time I had a Bacardi Breezer my cousins were shocked - lol", "Idk a really bad hangover is a pretty good punishment in and of itself", "Serious question you and both the comment before you said recovered alcoholic. I have been sober for many years at this point and I do not consider myself recovered because if I took one drink, I would be right back to square one. How come you consider yourself recovered. This is not meant to be rude. It\u2019s just a serious question because in my personal opinion, I will never be fully recovered because if I was to take one drink, I would be right back to square one.", "Yep.  Several posts here are just saying she got a \"beverage\" and speculating as to what it was when it clearly states it was a beer.", "I didn\u2019t puke from drinking until I was 27, mostly because I never drank to excess before then.", "My family are the \u201canything I do you don\u2019t is a personal attack\u201d type. They peer pressured me into trying booze AND weed, were highly aggravated to hear I never took the oxycodone I was prescribed after wisdom tooth surgery, were even MORE aggravated to hear I turned the full bottle back into the pharmacy after for disposal (they all self-medicate and pop prescriptions/swap prescriptions like candy)\u2026 Ridiculous!", "Top comment on her comment history is \u201cum idk what you\u2019re referring to, Aly has never taken my underwear as far as I know\u201d (spelling adjusted) in reference to someone asking her about the other post.\n\nETA: re-reading the two I see the similarities, so I wonder if it\u2019s real or if the second is a post troll.

I\u2019m also not someone that tends to rigidly adheres to AA/12 step program. Thus I tend to use slightly different language.

I mean for me I guess I have just always identified as an alcoholic first started attending meetings at 18 and I\u2019m 33 now so for me just sounds weird to say recovered.
