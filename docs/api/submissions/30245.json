Apologies first time posting on throw away account.\n\nI and my SO(Peter) have 5 kids. We live in another country but my family is back in my home country except for my twin brother (Ben) who lives here as well with his wife(Terry) and their children. \n\nNow my sister inlaw(Terry) is a very sensitive person so I do not talk to her much because I fear I might say something and offend her without intention( It has happened before, I apologised and we moved on but I am careful around her whe I speak). We are amicable but not close. \n\nMy SO Peter had a road accident and was hospitalised for a week. I immediately sent a message to my brother Ben. He came to see him but Terry never came. \n\nWe met a few days later after discharge and Terry acted shocked that he was hospitalised? I thought Ben told her. Ben told me I should have told her directly and not assume because she is also my family and an individual. I told Ben that him and Terry are one, so me telling him is enough and I was already in distress at the time. \n\nYesterday my 5yo got hospitalised. I sent Ben a quick msg. I was upset and crying while rushing to the hospital. He called me today when he was with Terry and she asked about my kid. I told her what happened briefly and made small talk. Ben said hes coming. I assumed they will come together. \n\nHe came alone today and went off on me why I did not send a message to Terry as well. It never crossed my mind honestly as we don't speak much and I forgot about our last conversation. I told him he was being unreasonable and informing one partner is equal to informing both. \n\nHe started off that I don't even call Terry. I told him she doesn't call me either, we don't call each other and moreso I do not call people much anyway. He said I have to initiate calling her so she can call me back. I felt like he wants me to treat Terry like he does, but I am not her partner, I don't feel the need to just do things to please her even if it is unreasonable to me. \n\nSo AITA for not personally texting or calling T to inform her whenever someone is Hospitalised in my family and telling B he is overeacting for no reason moreso I have a sick child right now and its not time to start thinking about anyones feelings ATM?", "created_utc": 1699026759, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17my5kc/aita_for_not_informing_my_inlaw_about_my_so_being/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If B continues to chew into you each time you call him during a moment you need support, might be time to stop calling him.", "I cannot begin to understand why you would have to call or update your Sil separately.  And in the middle of a crisis?? Wtf.", "NTA on the general question.  You communicating with your brother is normal, and he should have brought his wife into the loop.  \n\nInitially I thought he might have left her out, thinking that you wanted privacy about your SO's hospitalization...?  But it seems like this has more to do with your history with your SIL.  Sort it out later.", "NTA.  Your brother, however....", "NTA, you were distraught and really this is a communication issue between your brother and his wife. They are not one like you said but its pretty easy for your brother to relay the important information.", "Your brother is an idiot married to a snowflake. If someone tells me something important, I tell my wife. If Terry doesn't find out then either her husband does not want her to know or he does not care enough to tell her Neither is your problem. \n\nWhy do you have to initiate all contact? This is ridiculous and yoir brother's problem, not yours. Tell him to give you a call when he gets his wife mended.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You need to sit down with both of them and tell them that this comes from a good place. Number one, when the things that happened to your husband and child, you were not in the right frame of mind to contact everyone to inform them. That you chose to reach out to him and believed that he would tell his wife. At the time, you had other issues at hand that was more serious than to be on the phone to ensure everyone knew instead of believing that the one person per household knew what was going on. In fact, in the future, you have decided to designate one person to reach out to everyone so that you can deal with the situation at hand. Find someone else and not them.\n\nThen look at his wife and tell her you absolutely love her, and think nothing but great things about her. But having conversations with her has been difficult because she makes it so. That at times she misinterprets what you say, and that she makes you feel sad and uncomfortable because what she interprets was nothing that was meant. That this has happened a few times, that you are afraid to say anything at all to her in fear that she misunderstands what you are saying and it creates stress for you, because you have to really think about what you are going to say that can never be construed as an attack on her or anything negative to her. And even then it still isn\u2019t good enough. That you hate this because you really wanted to have that close bond with her.", "I guess you could always just put them both on a group text. So whatever you tell one the other will see. And don't call or pick up the phone. Let it go to voicemail and then answer the both of them by text? Weird - but it sounds like they have weird ideas about communication so worth a try ha ha....", "NTA Ben is more than capable of informing his wife of things like this and should be the one to do so. You've had two people you love hospitalized recently and enough to deal with. Why is Ben refusing to communicate with his own wife?", "Terry is so annoying. I bet she's telling Ben that you don't like her and pressing him to get you to be \"nice\" to her. No way would I think to text my brothers wife this info separately when it's assumed she knows by extension. It's not like a party invite to go see family in the hospital. It's family who make decisions to be there for each other. NTA.", "NTA \n\nYou are in a crisis so you don\u2019t have the time or bandwidth to call every individual person. \n\nYour brother is an AH because he should have told his own wife about what is going on especially when a family member is in crisis and needs support.\n\nMy family has a family group chat so that anyone can send a quick text to the whole family for situations like yours. Don\u2019t have to worry about calling/texting every person. Also makes sure that everyone is getting info and makes sure everyone has the same information\n\nI suggest making a family group chat and those who don\u2019t want to be part of the group chat can remove themselves. This allows everyone to have a choice to be in the group chat or not.", "NAH\n\nYou were upset and getting your kid taken care of. That is the most important thing.

We get it you don\u2019t like each other but someone has to be an adult. ESH", "NTA Terry is exhausting. Instead of caring about you and your family and asking how to help she is complaining you didn\u2019t contact her personally. She\u2019s heartless.", "NTA. Your brother is fucked up.  Why wouldn't he tell his  wife? He visited your SO and he still didn't mention it to her. There is something wrong with him.", "NTA. Ben should tell his wife. You\u2019re right that they are assumed to be the same person and you don\u2019t need to discern what information needs to be cascaded unless it has more to do with her than him. \n\nHe\u2019s probably aware you don\u2019t talk and is packing on everything as you not engaging with his wife. \n\nMy BIL and I don\u2019t do this and I get everything from my sister. It\u2019s just how it goes.", "NTA. Ben doesn't communicate with his own wife, that is his issue not yours.", "NTA!  I've been the SIL & OP and I agree OP, texting 1 is texting both.  My SIL has texted my Hubs in similar and I, once told what was going on by my hubby, always texted my SIL to check on her. And I've texted my bro and later on heard from my SIL, checking in on me.\n\nYour SIL seems extra, but your bro does too.  A lot of drama there, sounds exhausting.", "She's being ridiculous, especially given that you were in the middle of an emergency. If I tell my brother something, I make the assumption he tells his spouse. I don't have any issues with her, I like her quite a bit. Just...if she's getting this upset about being left out, she might need to talk about it with someone else.", "NTA. Someone needs to explain to Ben how a phone tree works.", "This is what I thought. It's  an emergency for crying out loud. And he is the only person I called.", "This!", "This was resolved. It was a small misunderstanding that happened over 10 years ago. I asked her if she has seen something I had when I visited them and she felt like I was asking her becaI thought she stole it. I had no idea she felt that and I found out months later whe she refused to visit when I invited. I was shocked. Family got involved on both sides, hers and mine were all on my sided. But to keep peace I apologised and told her that was not even in my mind, I might have misplaced it and thought since it is her house she might have seen it. \n\nAlso I have seen her interactions with my brother and how she is sensitive and reacts. He also once told me when they first got married that he does not know sometimes how to handle her because she gets pissed off easily.\n\nSo with all the above, I decided to keep cordial communication but very few times a year. But I speak to my brother often. We both call each other and have a family group we chat in. He has not added her in the group and said he will when she feels like joining\n\nEdit to apologies for the typos. English isn't my first language", "My brother really goes out of his way to help me whenever I need him and I do the same whenever he needs my help. He is my only relative in a foreign country,  apart from my own family of course. The issue I feel is he wants me to coddle his wife, which I am not comfortable with either.", "I am 100% sure he tells her. She just wants me to tell her personally I think. I don't understand why though. He coddles her a lot, I dont mind, its his wife, he can go to the moon for her and I wouldnt really mind. Just don't push me to this pettiness. \n\nI usually keep very low  contact with her. And call only once in a while after months to say hi. She never calls. She can hear me speaking to my brother often, even for hours sometimes when we discuss our extended family stuff. And I just always tell him to pass my greetings, and he tells me the same for my husband.", "I can only do this with her family there. So she does not fell like I am attacking her.", "That's a good idea. I can try this and just always text there whenever. But hopefully I don't forget when in an emergency situation.", "When they were to get married almost 2 decades ago, my brother was devastated because my parents did not like her(they came around eventually). I was the one who always stood up for them and told him to marry the love of his life. So I am the last person to express hatred. I am actually indifferent. Most of my siblings are, except one. We just don't meddle or care about anyones relationship as long as no one is violent.", "At the time of an emergency is not the time to do that.", "I don't know if she does not like me. I do not hate her at all. I just feel like I walk on eggshells around her that is why I avoid her most of the time. We are cordial.\n\nEdit to add: I easily sent a text to my brother because I call him often. I honestly did not even think it can be an issue realy. And after the first time he told me, this second time I completely forgot. In an emergency you always think of your first point of contact and rush to the hospital", "He mentioned it. I think she was pretending when we met that is why I was shocked. He confirmed he told her, but said I never told her, so...", "Yes the issue of not engaging his wife came up as well. But it goes both ways. I used to engage her but I stopped and talk only a few times to her. Just to keep peace. I hate stepping on toes", "Holy hell in a hand basket\u2026she sounds like a exhausting dramatic DRAMA queen.", "It just doesn't make sense to me why he feels that way.  I share everything with my spouse.  I don't expect people to notify us individually.  \n\nSo he may help you out - and I'm really glad he does! - but that still is kind of a AH move to make you do it.", ">personally\n\n>She just wants me to tell her personally I think.\n\nThen that's a 'her' problem. You told her husband, now she knows too so you've done what you set out to do. Your brother married her so making her happy is his problem, not yours. I get annoyed when people suddenly impose arbitrary expectations on me for no good reason (from my point of view) you sound the same. \n\nCarry on as you are, you can't possibly meet this crazy lady's needs so don't waste time trying.", "Then plan it with the family. Just let her know that you really want a healthy relationship with her where you are not afraid to say something innocent that she misinterpreted. I\u2019m sure she has done this to others. Otherwise, you will have no relationship in the future as you will seriously be avoiding her", "Yeah that\u2019s not your job though unless it\u2019s something like a wedding or baby shower for the ladies. He\u2019s being dramatic."]}
