I told him she doesn't call me either, we don't call each other and moreso I do not call people much anyway. He said I have to initiate calling her so she can call me back. I felt like he wants me to treat Terry like he does, but I am not her partner, I don't feel the need to just do things to please her even if it is unreasonable to me. \n\nSo AITA for not personally texting or calling T to inform her whenever someone is Hospitalised in my family and telling B he is overeacting for no reason moreso I have a sick child right now and its not time to start thinking about anyones feelings ATM?", "created_utc": 1699026759, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17my5kc/aita_for_not_informing_my_inlaw_about_my_so_being/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You communicating with your brother is normal, and he should have brought his wife into the loop.  \n\nInitially I thought he might have left her out, thinking that you wanted privacy about your SO's hospitalization...?

You need to sit down with both of them and tell them that this comes from a good place. Number one, when the things that happened to your husband and child, you were not in the right frame of mind to contact everyone to inform them. That you chose to reach out to him and believed that he would tell his wife. At the time, you had other issues at hand that was more serious than to be on the phone to ensure everyone knew instead of believing that the one person per household knew what was going on. In fact, in the future, you have decided to designate one person to reach out to everyone so that you can deal with the situation at hand. Find someone else and not them.\n\nThen look at his wife and tell her you absolutely love her, and think nothing but great things about her. But having conversations with her has been difficult because she makes it so. That at times she misinterprets what you say, and that she makes you feel sad and uncomfortable because what she interprets was nothing that was meant. That this has happened a few times, that you are afraid to say anything at all to her in fear that she misunderstands what you are saying and it creates stress for you, because you have to really think about what you are going to say that can never be construed as an attack on her or anything negative to her.

I bet she's telling Ben that you don't like her and pressing him to get you to be \"nice\" to her.

I asked her if she has seen something I had when I visited them and she felt like I was asking her becaI thought she stole it. I had no idea she felt that and I found out months later whe she refused to visit when I invited. I was shocked. Family got involved on both sides, hers and mine were all on my sided. But to keep peace I apologised and told her that was not even in my mind, I might have misplaced it and thought since it is her house she might have seen it. \n\nAlso I have seen her interactions with my brother and how she is sensitive and reacts. He also once told me when they first got married that he does not know sometimes how to handle her because she gets pissed off easily.\n\nSo with all the above, I decided to keep cordial communication but very few times a year.

And after the first time he told me, this second time I completely forgot. In an emergency you always think of your first point of contact and rush to the hospital", "He mentioned it.

Also they should learn about phone trees.\n\nNTA", "Here is something some people aren\u2019t aware of, not only does the telephone work both ways but so does the road! If she wants to be included in your life how about she makes an effort rather than expecting OP in the middle of a crisis to pander to her, if something happened in her family would she stop to give OP and HER HUSBAND a ring to inform them? SIL needs to grow the heck up and have a word with herself. NTA", "NTA.  Your brother is AH for adding more stress to you when you are dealing with a sick child.  You do not have a close relationship with T and you are correct when communicating to your brother you assume he is letting his spouse know.  Simply tell your brother you do not have a close relationship with T cause of her high sensitivity which just got proved again based on his response.  Clearly this is coming from her going off to your brother.  Instead of calling you during this time and being a comfort she is choosing to send your brother and have him take offense at absolute petty matters.  Hope your child gets well soon.", " *I told Ben that him and Terry are one, so me telling him is enough and I was already in distress at the time.*\n\nYou are right.  He's wrong.  Usually, when family comes to help you with this kind of crisis, they ask what you need for help.  Usually, one thing they do to help is to make the calls for you.\n\nNTA.\n\nHe's taking your child's illness and making this crisis about him.  Again.

My SO has just called and asked my why Ben is being ridiculous when he knows I told him already. I just laughed it off and told him to just ignore it", "The most sensible thing to do", "NTA. \n\nIn my family, the norm is to tell one or two key people, and those people will inform other family members. The fact that Ben doesn't even tell his wife things, and expects you to communicate the same information separately is absurd, especially in an emergency situation.\n\nI wonder if Ben is actually mad at his wife but can't tell her because he doesn't want to deal with her.  So, instead, he is taking it out on you and expects you to fix his marriage. Whether it is that or something else, it is not your problem.", "I'd send them a group text so they're not playing telephone and let them know that in an emergency, you expect them to be able to use their own mouths and brains to be independent for once.

Tell him that in an emergency, you will inform only him  because you need to spend your energy focusing on your loved one in the hospital. It is up to him inform the rest of his family.

You two are also the only family members in a foreign country. \n\nHis wife does not like that. She wants your brother to see you less, talk to you less, and be less involved in your life. She's finding the thinnest, dumbest, and most ridiculous issues to blow up over because you've done absolutely nothing else for her to complain about or criticize. Be aware of her tactics. Know that this is her ultimate goal.", "They're both fucked up then", "Then I suggest adding her to the group chat yourself because she can\u2019t add herself to it and sounds like your brother isn\u2019t going to include her or communicate/share info with her.\n\nBy adding her you put the ball in her court by giving her a choice to be in the loop or not. \n\nSo if she removes herself from the group chat then she can\u2019t play that the no one told me card and if she does or whines about not being told anything which you can say, \u201cI added you to the group chat so you can stay in the loop about things especially after the several incidents where my brother/your husband clearly doesn\u2019t share info.

Well, in that case, I would just notify Ben and ask him to please pass the info on to Terry. Asking for a direct call is too much!", "I think what you describe is normal.  Sometimes passing information is seen as the wife's job, maybe Ben is upset that he is being asked to do \"women's work\"?", "That would be such a shame though. In as much as we don't speak I do go out of my way to help her as well, from a distance though,if she asks. She rarely does but my brother asks on her behalf and I do help", "All I ever did was help my brother with the required documents so she can be with her here. Never done anything to her that I am aware of. I am human and might err, but apart from a  small misunderstanding back then, I haven't heard any complain from her even through others about me apart from the fact that I usually keep to myself a lot", "I am so bad at reading cues. Maybe that could be it, I don't know. But we have always had a very good relationship with Ben and we share a lot, if I find an opportunity I call him and he does the same for me, he alway cares about my well being. But... sometimes he holds back on certain things after asking Terry.\n\nMy mum had complained years back that she is trying to create a wedge between Ben and his siblings but I thought mum was just overthinking and also most attention is diverted to his wife and kids which is understandable as they are now his immediate family.  But mum just said \"you will see in time\" and she let it be. \n\nYears later mum asked me how often we visit each other, and I said not often because I really don't feel comfortable so we only meet on special holidays once or twice a Yr. But we talk on the phone several times a week with Ben. They do not invite me I do not invite them. On holidays we just speak with my brother to arrange who's house we visit.", "I can't.  I am not the admin. My Brother already quarrelled with my other siblings when they were pushing him to send her number so they can add her. His response was she will join when she wants. So that means she does not want to join. The other spouses are in the group including one of her cousins who is also married into our family. He just said \"I will try to convince her but I can't force her.\"", "She'll do it so long as *her husband* puts up with it.

The husband keeps entertaining it and rewarding her. OP cannot change hers brother's responses and risks losing the only family she has in their country if she approaches this in any direct, reasonable manner. It's a shitty spot to be in.", "I can't figure out why, I sometimes think it's just her character or how she was raised. She's the last born with a big age gap from the other siblings and was always the family baby. Maybe that contributed.", "You should talk to her about this expectation for you to contact her in emergencies and give her all of the same information that you gave your brother. Explain to her that she needs to communicate with her husband and not expect you to contact both of them. Make it clear that you are not excluding her, but you are not going to report emergencies individually. You contact your brother because he is the one that helps you in these situations.", "NTA - making your SIL feel included isn't your priority; your immediate family is. Their lack of communication in their own marriage isn't your problem and if they keep being AH suggest marriage counseling for their lack of communication.", "NTA.\nYou are absolutely correct that informing one part of a couple is enough.  They are responsible for updating their counterpart.\nIt sounds like your brother is hoping to force the communication between you and his wife, but he\u2019s going about it in a way that will backfire.", "NTA NTA NTA I hope everyone is ok!!!", "NTA one bit. \n\nIf you want to be maliciously compliant, start a group text with the 3 of you and only use that to communicate with your brother.", "NTA. Perfectly normal to treat married couples as one in instances like this. I suppose this may have been an advantage of landlines. \n\nAre they really together? Even if he is trying to include his spouse more in the family, this is not the situation for it.", "NTA and it's really weird that he expects you to call her individually when HE is your brother and she's the spouse. He's creating unnecessary drama also when you're family is going through something.", "Your brother is a champion AH. The time for hashing out your relationship is not when a member of your family is hurt and you are out of your mind with worry over them.\nNTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s unreasonable and you\u2019re right that informing one partner is the same as informing both. They live in the same house and communicate so they can talk if something happens. \n\nBut may I suggest starting a text thread with you, your husband, brother and his wife? Any future things can just be said in there and everybody can see. It may be easier to do this and avoid the stupid petty fights their causing over this", "NTA ... It's a weird request.\n\nMaybe just create a group text to avoid their BS?", "I'm trying to think if I have EVER texted my brother and my sister-in-law about the same thing, lol. Efficiency is king.", "I actually unlocked this achievement yesterday! It was to congratulate them both individually on their engagement to one another :) besides that, I can't really think of anything else to do that with.", ">'m trying to think if I have EVER texted my brother and my sister-in-law about the same thing, lol. Efficiency is king.\n\nWe use messenger. One chat for me, my brother, and my SIL. Another for us plus their kid. Plus of course separate one-on-one chats. If there was something I needed to say quickly, I'd put it in one of the shared chats.\n\nWhen I needed to share bad news about our mom, I called my SIL's phone (knowing she'd be near my brother) so she'd be involved in the convo. \n\nThen again, I \\*like\\* my brother and his family, and they like me. It doesn't seem like Ben \\*or\\* his wife like OP.", "I have mine in a group, and when it's really important I just drop it in there and let them sort out who's dealing with it\n.. Because I'm the one handling whatever it is over here.\n\nBut then, I have the kind of relationship with my SiL where we go shopping together and squee over books by our favourite authors and have, you know, actual conversations that don't involve our spouses or our kids or our mutual family members. So, you know, we're actual friends, not just Sisters in Law.", "Especially with married couples, it's generally assumed that by telling one spouse you're telling them both.", "Nice! That's exciting!\n\nI think I might have done it once when my brother had to remember to do something (SIL is less scattered, lol), but I'm not sure.", "The distinction that you draw between your family and his is important. Since SIL has taken information in the wrong way before, it makes sense to let OP\u2019s brother convey the information in a sensitive way. Otherwise, I would say that a group chat might be useful but here I think there\u2019s too much potential for drama", "I think you might have meant to reply to OP.", "Power plays are not about you treating her rightly or wrongly in the past. It can be ammunition to isolate your brother from you or prove that he will put her arbitrary whims over family. Likely, the only thing that you did was to be related to your brother"]}
