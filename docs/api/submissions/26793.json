I can only imagine just how many things are magically all your fault in her mind.", "I think it would be a good idea to include your kids in the discussion. Especially the younger one who only acts up with Mom. Honestly having a therapist or mediator YOU BOTH agree on is probably the best thing so everyone has equal opportunity to be heard (and called out on when ex is trying to be manipulative). Ignoring the text wasn't the best coparenting move but you also need to protect your peace which your ex doesn't seem to give af about.", "NTA\n\nYou're her ex.  You shouldn't have to be her emotional support or her emotional punching bag.   She sounds somewhat unhinged and not over you at all.  She demands of you and it sounds like you are going above and beyond for the kid.  Her yelling at you makes me wonder if she's yelling at the 7 year old, which is potentially emotionally abusive.  The kid hitting herself in inspired by....something going on at your ex's house.   \n\nMore than a mediator, you should ensure the kid is in counseling.   And I'd consider lawyering up.   What the heck IS going on that has inspired that 7 year old to self harm?   Is Mom abusing her?   Did she *really* hit herself?  Or is that Mom covering up for abuse?   \n\nNTA.   But you need to take steps and evaluate this situation carefully.  This is potentially an awful situation for your daughter.", "NTA but consider texting, 'message received' instead of nothing. Her text was 'let me know if 'x' happens. This does not obligate you to update her given the behavior is not observed when child is with you.\n\nFactual responses are your go-to. Mediators, etc. can and should review how parents communicate. Texts and emails only. Phone and in person is not helpful to you since it gives her free reign to have a meltdown, manipulate, blame, etc. Best to you!\n\n\\*\\*She carries more baggage than 3 airport terminals and its...not-your-problem. Thanks for the many ways you are in their lives. Their behavior confirms this is critical!", "This is above this subreddit's paygrade, but based solely on your description, it sounds like maybe there's a pattern of her bringing up concerns to you and you dismissing them? Like if I had told my ex that our kid was having behavior issues, and he just said \"well at my house I make sure they're happy\" I would be livid. \n\nINFO: What was she trying to rehash from your marriage?

Try to find a way to communicate with her without falling into her trap.", "ESH- I think you ignoring the text did not help any.   Why not tell her \"Sure, will let you know if I see her do this\". If it doesnt happen, then nothing else needs to be said.  Her first text is something parents should share as its behavior that needs to be monitored.\n\nAnd you aren't reading her text logically, she said that you dont care what happens at her house, nothing was said that you dont care about the kids.  Her comment was not needed either way.\n\nAnd yes if she can't keep her cool, then having someone else help mediate is what you should do.

About a month ago, she sent me this: \n\n> And fyi had some issues with [DAUGHTER] this weekend. She got mad at herself and hit herself in the head then later threw pajamas at me and on another incident kicked my seat in the car. I know you historically haven\u2019t cared much when things happen at my place and not yours so I guess I\u2019m just letting you know to let me know if you see any of that at your place. \n\nThis daughter just turned 7, just for a frame of reference. \n\nI did not reply to this text. We\u2019d had similar exchanges before, with this particular daughter acting out at my ex\u2019s house but not mine. So we met to discuss it, and that discussion went poorly. I tried to tell her the things I did at my house to make sure our daughter was happy, calm, and comfortable. My ex got defensive and started yelling, and finally demanded an apology for something I had done while we were married several years ago (nothing severe). I refused to rehash the marriage and chose to focus on the child. She kept yelling, and I eventually just asked her to leave.\n\nI did not reply to that particular text, however there were many, many texts following that I replied to promptly. \n\nSo yesterday she texts me that she feels \u201calone\u201d in parenting our children and needs more attention from me. For the record, I have the kids 50/50, but because of my ex\u2019s work schedule, in addition to 50/50 time I also: \n\n- Pick up the older daughter from her on all her mornings and take her to school so my ex can tend to the younger one (my ex does not help me at all on my mornings)\n- Pick up both kids from all extracurriculars because my ex\u2019s schedule doesn\u2019t allow. This is 3 days per week I am picking them up from school. \n- Get them off the bus on all non-extracurricular days. They stay with me until my ex can get them. \n- Handle every single sick day and vacation day because I WFH and she does not.\n\nJust listing this out here so it is understood I am not an absentee father at all, and am very active and involved with my children.\n\nI am greatly offended by her text saying \u201cI know you haven\u2019t historically cared much\u201d, because caring for my children is basically the only thing I do well. In my mind, I just refused to engage with my ex as she was getting passive-aggressive and shitty with me. I won\u2019t engage in another conversation with her that ends in her yelling at me about something I did years ago while married. If she wants to have a chat about the kids, she needs to approach me in a non-accusatory and respectful way. I told her this and she replied back that we \u201cneed a mediator\u201d. \n\nAnyway. Am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Like \u201cok\u201d or a thumbs up reaction or whatever?\n\nDo you find it nice and respectful when you try to tell someone you have a concern and they ignore you?\n\nFrequently kids act up at the house where they feel most secure. I don\u2019t think your approach of trying to tell your ex she was not parenting as well as you was necessarily justified.", "[deleted]", "ESH\n\n> I am greatly offended by her text saying \u201cI know you haven\u2019t historically cared much\u201d, because caring for my children is basically the only thing I do well\n\nExcept she didn't say you don't care about your children.  She wrote:\n\n>  I know you historically haven\u2019t cared much **when things happen at my place and not yours**\n\nShe shouldn't be screaming, and you should try reading things more clearly and not misconstruing things so much.\n\nShe wants a shoulder to cry on, not a list of possible solutions that work for you, that come off to her as you saying she must be very dumb for not figuring out for herself.\n\nYou don't owe her your shoulder.

Are you SURE you don't wish you were still married to her?\n\nNTA.", "I agree with this reply and advice.\n\nIt can be anything else, really, but to have counselling will help your daughter whatever the cause for the self-harm (and potential anger management issues, kicking when she could express her emotions etc) is.\n\nIf it is (partially) because of your exs parenting, you might consider lawyering up early like the commenter suggested and think about how you could include your child (children?) in your life 100% until their mother has worked and fixed any problems she may have.\n\nNTA, good luck OP", "> it sounds like maybe there's a pattern of her bringing up concerns to you and you dismissing them?\n\nJust to clarify, the first time we\u2019d dealt with this was the same issue (my younger throwing massive tantrums at her mom\u2019s house and not mine), we did have a long discussion where I was engaged and thoughtful and was trying to be helpful. I wasn\u2019t as dismissive as \u201cat my house they\u2019re happy\u201d, more like observations I\u2019d seen and thought may help. My ex is a controlling person, and my younger daughter needs and wants a little agency and I do not believe my ex provides enough of that if I am being honest, and I think that lack of agency is why she flips out. But I tried to explain this, and this is when my ex instead lashed out at me.\n\n> What was she trying to rehash from your marriage? I'd bet anything it's relevant and explains at least some of her reaction.\n\nI really don\u2019t think it\u2019s relevant, but I guess I am leaving it for anonymous people to decide. My ex knew I had ADHD even before I did, and it did at least partially contribute to the marriage failing. A few weeks before our fight, we were chatting casually and I mentioned how with her gone, my ADHD was a lot more noticeable for me and I was taking more serious steps to resolve it than I did while married. I was trying to extend an olive branch and take accountability for something in our marriage, while also assuring her that I was taking care of myself to maintain a better home for the children.\n\nIn our discussion-turned-fight, she was angry because she \u201cgot an explanation but not an apology\u201d, so I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t get it treated while married,\u201d but she said my apology \u201cdidn\u2019t count\u201d because she had to ask for it. This is when I asked her to leave and told her that I would no longer rehash the marriage and would only engage her on topics related to the children.", "> Why not tell her \"Sure, will let you know if I see her do this\". If it doesnt happen, then nothing else needs to be said\n\nJust for the record, this was our understanding. This is not the first time this has come up. We had one talk-turned-fight about the issue, but I have said to her several times in the last couple years \u2018I will let you know if I see this\u2019. I have never seen it.", "> Why didn\u2019t you reply to confirm you\u2019d gotten the text?\n\nBecause I found the text rude and passive-aggressive and didn\u2019t want to engage with it.\n\n> Do you find it nice and respectful when you try to tell someone you have a concern and they ignore you?\n\nI was going to post it in my OP, but I hit the character limit. Last week we had an issue with our other daughter, on my time. I texted my ex about it and she did not reply to me. I was fine with it because I wasn\u2019t asking for input, I was keeping her informed. Same as what I assumed was happening previously. \n\nIn other words, I am fine with a non-reply and she and I both do it frequently. Not every text needs a reply or confirmation in my opinion.\n\nNot trying to be defensive, hopefully just clarifying.", "Not sure what you mean by \u201ctriangulating\u201d, but I did go into details about the \u201cnothing severe\u201d here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16huird/aita_for_not_replying_to_a_text_from_my_exwife/k0fxxvb/", "So, your ex knew you were neurodivergent before you did yourself (not so unusual just in case someone asks themselves if it is) but did - nothing?\n\nAnd then blames you for not having (some of your) neurodivergent traits (?) under better control back then because you obviously shouldn\u2019t work on yourself to make your life easier when she had it \u201ehard\u201c with you? \n\nNTA, but she sounds like a piece of work. All the best to you OP, if things are exactly like you described I am happy for you that you seem to thrive and are trying to be a good parent, even if the marriage didn\u2019t work out.", "Just keep repeating it when she asks though. Stops any extra fighting, and you've then got proof you did respond to her in a polite/calm manner.   Yes, I think she is trying to pick fights and your way of not responding isnt helping the matter.", "NTA. Sometimes no reply is the best reply to someone who has a habit of picking fights.", "[deleted]", "> You\u2019re using Reddit as your mediator and also trying to manipulate Reddit into taking your side on this issue by putting your ex in an ill-fitting role\n\nI had not considered this in this way, but you are right. But how am I using my child in \u201ctriangulating\u201d? I am actually looking to challenge my outlook here and am receptive to changes.\n\n> ADD marriages can end in divorce with yours being an example. I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s \u201cnothing severe.\u201d \n\nMy ADHD was an annoyance to her, but I honestly think both of us would call the annoyance \u201cminor\u201d. In a vacuum we could\u2019ve overcome this easily. Our marriage was very troubled, full of conflict and unending fights despite many years of individual and couples therapy.\n\nWhy does my ex \u201cdeserve\u201d an apology? We are divorced. I haven\u2019t gotten an apology for any of the things she did that contributed to the failure of the marriage. Do I also deserve one? Am I allowed to be hostile to her until I get an apology?", "Lol fuck that, it's not his problem. She doesn't need an apology NTA"]}
