For the sake of this post, the name she wants to have is Daisy. My sister gave me these 3 reasons. \n\nFirst, she dislikes her original name because it is spelt \"weird\" (it is spelt normally). Second, her original name is \"made fun of online because it is a basic white girl name\". We are white. And lastly, her new boyfriend did not like that her name was the same as his sister and this made him uncomfortable. So she wishes to change it because of him. She told me this and i, hopefully understandably, refused because those are absurd reasons to change your name. And changing your name for a boy? That is beyond me.\n\nNow context for the next part. I am myself, queer. I am a lesbian and i use she/they pronouns. The thing is, my sister is not queer. If she was, say, trans i would not have a problem with her wanting to change her name. In fact i would support it. However, that is not the case here.\n\nI have spoken to my family and close friends and they all agree with me that her reasons to be called daisy are, for lack of a better word, stupid. \n\nHowever, she is convinced that i am \"evil\" even though i have apologised and explained why. Moreso she has been telling my friends lies about me at our school to get people to hate me. Someone has even gone to so far to claim i am \"homophobic\" for not calling her daisy? But she isnt changing her name for a gender related reason?\n\nSo, am i the asshole? \n\nNote: most people call her by her original name, not Daisy.", "created_utc": 1671614584, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zrfgyy/aita_for_refusing_to_call_my_sister_by_a/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My mother had kind of a silly nickname growing up that she absolutely hated, but she had no power to stop people from calling her that. When we were growing up, she always hammered home the point that you call people what they want to be called, not what you THINK they should be called.

It doesn\u2019t matter what you think of their reason, or chosen name for that matter. \n\nIf someone I cared about told me they wanted me to call them Princess Rainbow Sparkles because the moon told them that was their true self I would call them that.

Maybe she really has never liked her birth name and this was the push she needed to change it. Either way, what you are currently communicating to your sister is that you think your opinion is more important than her feelings, and are unwilling to extend to her even the smallest courtesy of calling her by the name she has asked people to use. A basic politeness that you would give a stranger is something you are not willing to offer your sister, because you apparently know better than her what she should be called.", "YTA. It\u2019s just basic common decency to call someone by the name they wish to go by.

Why are you the one who gets to decide whether her reasons are valid or not? There are plenty of people who feel that the reasons transgender people have to change their names are invalid so why would you want to associate yourself with that sort of person?

I love how two of the three reasons are personal and you are saying she shouldn\u2019t change her name for a boy. Like 2/3 isn\u2019t about the boy so clearly it\u2019s not the deciding factor. Also if she wants to even for a boy that\u2019s her right. Her other reasons are pretty valid. People accept Carmen Electra, Marilyn Monroe, Vin Diesel, Marilyn Manson, but not when a random not famous person wants to do it. Also do people now have to be queer or trans to live with a name of their choosing? Are we gatekeeping name changing? It shouldn\u2019t matter why she wants to change her name. She should be allowed to. And yeah you may be white that doesn\u2019t mean she has to live under what\u2019s considered a traditionally white name. All of your excuses are ignore part her reason while also stating you just think they\u2019re dumb. I\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have siblings like you. I\u2019d never want to confide in someone so judgmental.", "NTA your sister is stupid", "YTA.\n\nYou know full well that calling someone a preferred name isnt a big deal. Doesn't matter their reasons for the desire of a preferred name neither. And you know damn Skippy that someone doesn't have to be trans to have a nickname or something they prefer other than their legal name.\n\nAlso. For all you know she's been made fun of currently or in the past for having a \"basic white girl\" name. People find any reason to make fun of a name. She may find the spelling weird even if it's \"normal\" spelling. And tbh I kinda get where she's coming from about the whole sister has the same name thing. Thst could be awkward as fuck and confusing as fuck. Because he could go \"oh yea daisy failed 6th grade for plagiarizing a final essay\" and he could mean his sister but someone could easily misunderstand and think he meant your sister. \n\nRespect your sister just like you'd want to be respected. Which means calling her by the preferred name she wants. Also fyi for ALL you know she could be questioning herself about who she is inside. She could be queer or nonbinary or gender fluid etc. You don't know what's going on in her head. She may not know how to communicate what's in her head so having \"silly\" reasons might be the best way she knows how to communicate things.\n\nFYI I'm non-binary but I do go by my very feminine legal name because I like it. But I also occasionally go by Angel which is really unisex when I feel I need to or I'm online. Hell Alyssa is a alias too. Preferred names aren't just used for trans people. You know this. You fucked up. You need to apologize. \n\nAnd start calling her by whatever name she asked you to. And stop calling her daisy unless it's for legal purposes (and explain to her that's the only time you'll call her, her legal name is for legal purposes)", "Wow what are these responses?

They are literally transitioning into who they really see themselves as. It must be such a freeing, yet terrifying thing to go through. \n\nTell your sister to stop being such a dumbass.

For the sake of this post, the name she wants to have is Daisy. My sister gave me these 3 reasons. \n\nFirst, she dislikes her original name because it is spelt \"weird\" (it is spelt normally). Second, her original name is \"made fun of online because it is a basic white girl name\". We are white. And lastly, her new boyfriend did not like that her name was the same as his sister and this made him uncomfortable. So she wishes to change it because of him. She told me this and i, hopefully understandably, refused because those are absurd reasons to change your name. And changing your name for a boy? That is beyond me.\n\nNow context for the next part. I am myself, queer. I am a lesbian and i use she/they pronouns. The thing is, my sister is not queer. If she was, say, trans i would not have a problem with her wanting to change her name. In fact i would support it. However, that is not the case here.\n\nI have spoken to my family and close friends and they all agree with me that her reasons to be called daisy are, for lack of a better word, stupid. \n\nHowever, she is convinced that i am \"evil\" even though i have apologised and explained why. Moreso she has been telling my friends lies about me at our school to get people to hate me. Someone has even gone to so far to claim i am \"homophobic\" for not calling her daisy? But she isnt changing her name for a gender related reason?\n\nSo, am i the asshole? \n\nNote: most people call her by her original name, not Daisy.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "INFO: It depends though if your sister wasn\u2019t dating this guy would she change her name?

I still struggle to understand, but I will be respectful and I try my best to use the preferred names and pronouns, even though I struggle at times cause my brain may interpret the person as a different gender and I need to stop myself. It\u00b4s hard changing something that has been ingrained into your brain. You\u00b4ve known your sis as \"old name\" for all of your life, so I understand its hard.
