{"id": 5276, "submission_id": "zrfgyy", "title": "AITA for refusing to call my sister by a different name?", "selftext": "Preface, this is a throwaway\n\nSo, a few months ago, my(17f) sister(16f) told me she would like to use a different name than her birth name. For the sake of this post, the name she wants to have is Daisy. My sister gave me these 3 reasons. \n\nFirst, she dislikes her original name because it is spelt \"weird\" (it is spelt normally). Second, her original name is \"made fun of online because it is a basic white girl name\". We are white. And lastly, her new boyfriend did not like that her name was the same as his sister and this made him uncomfortable. So she wishes to change it because of him. She told me this and i, hopefully understandably, refused because those are absurd reasons to change your name. And changing your name for a boy? That is beyond me.\n\nNow context for the next part. I am myself, queer. I am a lesbian and i use she/they pronouns. The thing is, my sister is not queer. If she was, say, trans i would not have a problem with her wanting to change her name. In fact i would support it. However, that is not the case here.\n\nI have spoken to my family and close friends and they all agree with me that her reasons to be called daisy are, for lack of a better word, stupid. \n\nHowever, she is convinced that i am \"evil\" even though i have apologised and explained why. Moreso she has been telling my friends lies about me at our school to get people to hate me. Someone has even gone to so far to claim i am \"homophobic\" for not calling her daisy? But she isnt changing her name for a gender related reason?\n\nSo, am i the asshole? \n\nNote: most people call her by her original name, not Daisy.\n\nEdit: \nPlease stop being homophobic in the comments. I agree now that i am most likely the asshole but that does not give you the right to berate me. \n\nAnd please stop sending me death threats, i thought we were to be civil.\n\nEdit 2:\nHi, I've decided to apologise to my sister as she deserves one. And i will try to have a talk with her, but (because of unrelated reasons) she may not listen to me. I agree i should respect her autonomy and will be calling her by her name.\n\nI do want to say, as i should of mentioned it, i would of called her it to begin with if she has not mentioned the boyfriend thing. Changing your identity for a boy makes me concerned for her. But i agree, it is not my life and i will encourage my family to call her Daisy as well.\nThanks :)\n\nEdit 3:\nHi, this is my last edit before i leave this thread alone. I have apologised to my sister, and yes i am the asshole, and have agreed to call her Daisy. This was not to make you guys happy, not sure why youd think that, but because i genuinely love my sister as she is my only family. Again, thank everyone and i hope everyone has a happy holidays. \nMine will be better now :) \ud83d\udc96", "created_utc": 1671614584, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zrfgyy/aita_for_refusing_to_call_my_sister_by_a/", "score": 2436, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My mother had kind of a silly nickname growing up that she absolutely hated, but she had no power to stop people from calling her that. When we were growing up, she always hammered home the point that you call people what they want to be called, not what you THINK they should be called.

It doesn\u2019t matter what you think of their reason, or chosen name for that matter. \n\nIf someone I cared about told me they wanted me to call them Princess Rainbow Sparkles because the moon told them that was their true self I would call them that.

Maybe she really has never liked her birth name and this was the push she needed to change it. Either way, what you are currently communicating to your sister is that you think your opinion is more important than her feelings, and are unwilling to extend to her even the smallest courtesy of calling her by the name she has asked people to use. A basic politeness that you would give a stranger is something you are not willing to offer your sister, because you apparently know better than her what she should be called.", "YTA. It\u2019s just basic common decency to call someone by the name they wish to go by.

Why are you the one who gets to decide whether her reasons are valid or not? There are plenty of people who feel that the reasons transgender people have to change their names are invalid so why would you want to associate yourself with that sort of person?

For all you know she's been made fun of currently or in the past for having a \"basic white girl\" name. People find any reason to make fun of a name. She may find the spelling weird even if it's \"normal\" spelling. And tbh I kinda get where she's coming from about the whole sister has the same name thing. Thst could be awkward as fuck and confusing as fuck.

She may not know how to communicate what's in her head so having \"silly\" reasons might be the best way she knows how to communicate things.\n\nFYI I'm non-binary but I do go by my very feminine legal name because I like it.

You fucked up. You need to apologize. \n\nAnd start calling her by whatever name she asked you to. And stop calling her daisy unless it's for legal purposes (and explain to her that's the only time you'll call her, her legal name is for legal purposes)\n\nEdit: also your comments make you sound extremely homophobic and that's sad. Internalized homophobia sucks. Especially when it's against family. She doesn't have to have valid reasons in your mind for a preferred name. Her reasons are valid enough.

Her reasons are valid and doesn't have to fit your \"view point\" that's what bigots say regarding queer people. Why some people say lesbians are fine but gay men aren't. Because half of it fits their \"view points\" but the other half doesn't so it's wrong to them. It's still homophobic as hell and just as wrong. Do better.", "Wow what are these responses?

For the sake of this post, the name she wants to have is Daisy. My sister gave me these 3 reasons. \n\nFirst, she dislikes her original name because it is spelt \"weird\" (it is spelt normally). Second, her original name is \"made fun of online because it is a basic white girl name\". We are white. And lastly, her new boyfriend did not like that her name was the same as his sister and this made him uncomfortable. So she wishes to change it because of him. She told me this and i, hopefully understandably, refused because those are absurd reasons to change your name. And changing your name for a boy? That is beyond me.\n\nNow context for the next part. I am myself, queer. I am a lesbian and i use she/they pronouns. The thing is, my sister is not queer. If she was, say, trans i would not have a problem with her wanting to change her name. In fact i would support it. However, that is not the case here.\n\nI have spoken to my family and close friends and they all agree with me that her reasons to be called daisy are, for lack of a better word, stupid. \n\nHowever, she is convinced that i am \"evil\" even though i have apologised and explained why. Moreso she has been telling my friends lies about me at our school to get people to hate me. Someone has even gone to so far to claim i am \"homophobic\" for not calling her daisy? But she isnt changing her name for a gender related reason?\n\nSo, am i the asshole? \n\nNote: most people call her by her original name, not Daisy.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "INFO: It depends though if your sister wasn\u2019t dating this guy would she change her name?

Some people can achieve confidence in who they are at younger stages than others, which may be the case for you.

But she gets surprised comments when she spells her name and needs to correct spellings all the time.  **Two** society is changing between two variant spellings being most common.

At my next job (grad school at a new uni), I started right out with they/them only, and let me tell you. It was a feminist philosophy department and even there almost no one, including my own supervisor, would refer to me as \u201cthey\u201d, even in emails. Even despite me repeatedly reminding people, especially my professors. Who again! Were mostly feminist, well read, apparently trans inclusive people!

In high school I was in a class with a different set of same name girls and then I chose to be called by my last name. My point is that they have to do something to differentiate between two people who are around each other often. Maybe neither like the available nicknames for their shared name. Maybe there isn\u2019t a good nickname for the name. Maybe it feels stupid to be called \u201cfirst name last initial.\u201d I hated that myself. Maybe she has never liked her name and sees this as a chance to try a different one out. If it was just for the boyfriend, she\u2019d probably be fine with him using the name Daisy for her and going by her given name at home. It honestly sounds like she doesn\u2019t like her given name and her boyfriend\u2019s sister sharing the name is just the final push she needed to change it. And regardless she is a teenager and that is a time for experimentation. She isn\u2019t walking into a county registrar\u2019s office and filing for an official name change she is just asking people to call her by a different name.

I hope you'll reassess.", "But trans isn't the same thing as gender dysphoria, and you said they aren't trans.\n\nCan you explain why you think that definition assumes 2 genders? I thought it was appropriately accommodating. It encompasses all people that don't identify as the gender they were assigned at birth and does not require that they do identify with the other binary gender, so I don't see how it wouldn't apply to non-binary people. They don't identify as the gender they were assigned at birth, so they fit.\n\nThat doesn't make lesbian binary. It means that you see it as a term that non-binary people are not allowed to use. But to me, that implies, you'd also not allow them to use \"gay\" or \"bi\". So what sexuality are non-binary people allowed to claim? \n\nI don't see why they can't use the label lesbian if that what makes sense to them. Even if they don't see themselves as entirely female, if they feel more feminine than not and are attracted to feminine people, \"lesbian\" may be the label they identify with most. \n\nBut most importantly, that's their call to make and **not yours**. You don't get to tell someone they aren't a lesbian. Just like you don't get to tell someone they aren't non-binary because they were afab and the one time you saw them, they appeared feminine and did something feminine.\n\nTHAT is what the LGBT community is about.
