Instead of buying $200 in meals for yourself use that money for groceries to feed you & your younger brother.", "You should probably edit your post to explain this is out of concern for your brother", "OP, fuck all these mouth breathers in their basements  calling you T A. You are NTA, you\u2019ve simply outgrown your parents and realize that you can\u2019t count on them. Do continue to try and help your brother eat healthier.", "I don\u2019t understand the question.", "I think you\u2019re stuck then if they\u2019re not willing to trade or provide more. It\u2019s not easy but your best bet is to be self sufficient and work towards getting yourself out of their house. You\u2019ll be glad when you have total control over your own living situation! Good luck", "So from what I assume (correct me if i'm wrong!) you're looking at recipes, noting the ingredients and offering them to your parents to buy/make?\n\nYou also mentioned that you eat 'decent' meals throughout the week and otherwise eat the kraft/quick meals you consider unhealthy. what kind of meals are they? can you give some examples? i feel  like that might be some important context to add to your post. \n\ni'm assuming also based on your schedule with work/school you dont have much time to cook either.\n\ni know you're worried about your growing brother and thats great! you can always take him to the doctor and talk about your concerns there, if thats an option.", "At 12 I shopped and cooked meals for my family. Your brother is not a \u201chelpless child\u201d- even my daughter was able to cook for herself at 9. You two can pair up and do something other than complain here about it.", "[deleted]", "Helpless child? I planned all my own meals, found the recips, made the lists, did the shopping (with my parents money) and did all my own cooking when I was NINE.", "That is strange. I guess you are going to have to fend for yourself. 200 a month with an extra 100 for eating out is possible for one person. You can stretch it with the food they provide. Cooking for one is hard. I don't see you have any other options here.", "I suppose my question is, do they LIKE eating this way, or are they just lazy/unconcerned? Did you cook a meal with veggies in the last week that they ate? I\u2019m just wondering if their narrow food options are a conscious choice on their part. \n\nMy step-father won\u2019t eat vegetables if you pay him. He likes tater tots and chicken nuggets only, and a green apple a few times a week. And LOTS of Diet Coke. It\u2019s insane to me. He has health issues, but it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t want to eat anything else, not because no one is willing to provide him with something better (which my mom would since she makes herself better/more varied food).", "The way I read the comment is he\u2019s spending $200 for food he likes - which is his choice - and the food his parents refer to is the stuff he doesn\u2019t like.", "They may be happy, but that doesn\u2019t mean my brother isn\u2019t being significantly harmed by their eating habits.", "Yeah I agree, it\u2019s rare a child likes healthy food over junk food, though I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a good enough reason to allow a child to develop bad eating habits that could impact them the rest of their lives.", "OP keeps mentioning proper nutrition like the kid is being starved. No, OP is just being judgy because it's not \"healthy\"", "He literally said they eat good except for 2-3 days per week when they have Kraft. The kid is not malnourished", "He's complaining because they have quick and easy meals 4 nights a week and he doesn't like it. How is he N T A for complaining about it lol\n\nAlso, he pays absolutely no bills and willingly shares the food he buys.", "No kid ever on the face of the planet has problems eating junk food. The difference is they aren\u2019t in a financially hard spot and they are willingly feeding him unhealthy food that could effect him the rest of his life.", "I have had atleast monthly chats since I was 16. Nothing has, or ever will change.", "OP said they only do the boxed canned food 4 times a week. The rest of the time it's decent food. He's 20, pays no bills, and still has the audacity to complain about the food his parents stock -.-", "The parents should give him money to subsidize the younger brother\u2019s portion.", "It's not though. OP is just shocked so many people aren't siding with him. And in the end the parents provide decent meals 3 nights a week and provide quick and easy meals the other 4. Neither kid is going hungry or anything.", "The parents provide good food 3 times a week and quick easy meals the other 4 days. Nobody is underfed or malnourished. He also lives at home completely free. He pays nothing at all. \n\nIf he's outgrown his parents then he needs to move out. Not complain because he doesn't like their food options lol. He literally asked if he's the AH for complaining about there being no food. Considering there is ALWAYS food. Yeah, of course he's an AH.", "Boughten isn\u2019t a word.", "I already do", "OP has said that the parents provide decent meals 3 nights a week and quick and easy meals the other 4. He's just entitled lol", "What? Do they have like candy soup or something?\n\nCanned soup isn't great, but it doesn't arise to actual junk food.", "Has a medical professional said your brother is nutritionally deficient?  No?  Then shhhhh.", "SIGNIFICANTLY HARMED!!!!! LMAO\n\nYou have got to be kidding me, the kid will be fine. You're catastrophizing something that's actually insignificant. That's not a healthy way to process things.", "You would be shocked by the amount of people that live perfectly healthy lives on a the type of diet you're judging so harshly.", "Yep! They act like them cooking once or twice a month is this huge deal lol.", "What did YOU eat growing up with these same parents? Aside from being a judgmental AH, you seem to have grown up just fine.", "I assume it's canned soup and something like Kraft mac & cheese?\n\nYou're being a food snob here.", "That sucks.   I make sure there are tons of fresh fruit and healthy options for my kids.   Much rather them eat healthy.  \n\nI guess the only option for you is to buy it yourself.   I feel for you and your bro.", "Yeah I think OP just got shocked by everyone disagreeing with him and is pulling the \"concern for my brother's health\" card to try desperately to win back some sympathy.", "But it is\u2026.", "Maybe not junk food in the sense of chips and ice cream, but in the sense that it\u2019s incredibly hard to actually be healthy eating meals consisting solely of high carb low protein and almost no veggies.", "I ate mac n cheese almost every day for 6 months after dental surgery. Bless my heart. Should have started a gofundme for a vacation to recover from the trauma.", "Not at all. The child should be eating better if his guardians can afford it.", "I highly disagree that wanting healthy meals for a developing body who is highly susceptible to bad habit making as they are 12 years old being a food snob. I understand if this is all my parents could afford to buy but for fucks sake they make 200k a year combined. No car payments between the two, and a house worth 300 000 dollars.", "Yeah, which honestly won't work nearly as well as he thinks. His parents provide good food 3 times a week and quick easy meals the other 4 days. No one is malnourished or underfed lol.", "No, it's not.  Like we don't get enough bad grammar on AITA.   I get so tired of seeing \"me and him\" as the subject in a sentence.", "Cook your own food if you don't like it. Make your own veggies, buy your own salad. \n\nThis does not in any way amount to anything anyone is going to give a shit about or consider in any way providing poor nutrition to your brother.", "They say they work 36 hours a week and don't pay anything at all for bills. Even at the federal minimum wage they can afford to make themselves food. Especially since they already get 3 decent dinners a week. Poor kid, has to buy 4 days worth a food a week and literally nothing else -.- \n\nI grew up only eating Mac and cheese and a few other incredibly cheap meals. Never anything fresh. The younger brother will be just fine. Presumably they grew up this way and have no nutritional problems. They are 100% using their brother as an excuse hoping people will side with them here lol", "He's not your kid, and your parents feeding him these type of foods do not make them assholes.\n\nYou are showing your own asshole here though.", "Not only are you a food snob, but you're a regular snob too based on the way you talk about your parent's money.", "Big question for you\u2026. What food did you eat growing up? Is it any different that what is prepared for your brother? I suspect that your parents have not changed their pantry. So tell us OP how has your health suffered from the foods you ate growing up??? And since you more than likely lacked \u201chealthy meals for a developing body who is highly susceptible to bad habit making as a 12 year old\u201d how is it you are able to now form different habits or are you saying that you too are not able to make these choices now because of the food your parents provided you growing up. No court would drag your parents over the coals and put your brother in foster care because your parents provided Mac n cheese and not a five course meal. The problem here is you not your family no matter their finances. If your brother desires different food then HE can ask his parents to buy something different. If you feel this strongly then why don\u2019t YOU offer to prepare dinner for the whole family\u2026 ASK your brother if he would like to help in prepping and cooking. Since you have an income take him food shopping with you. Here\u2019s a thought stop complaining and nagging your parents and figure out solutions. My mom used to meal prep for two weeks at a time and then buy all the ingredients needed. Why don\u2019t you try something similar and ASK your mom NICELY. Solutions\u2026not bitching\u2026you are definitely old enough to be mature about this and start using your cognitive skills for problem solving\u2026 make that a life long habit!", "Sorry, I need to confirm this...\n\n>house worth 300 000 dollars.\n\nIs that 300k? Cause uh... these days, that's not a whole lot.", "It literally is. Not even comparable to your example.", "It is actually a word. I had to look it up because it sounded weird to me too. But it means \"the opposite of homemade\" and originates in North America.", "I kind of disagree. As a kid who grew up on ramen and Kraft Mac and cheese, it\u2019s definitely NOT healthy and not setting him up for healthy eating as an adult. This is why America has such a bad obesity issue. It\u2019s a real problem, not just people being \u201cfood snobs\u201d", "Yeah I really don't understand what anyone is trying to argue here. I also grew up eating that shit. Everything was frozen , pre-packaged, canned or otherwise full of preservatives. And tons of fast food. Did I starve? No. But no wonder I never had any energy or felt good about what I was eating. It took me a very long time to learn how to properly cook for myself and start shifting my eating habits away from processed garbage. I had no idea how good food could actually be. I'm 30 now and still have to convince myself not to buy certain crap just cause it's easy"]}
