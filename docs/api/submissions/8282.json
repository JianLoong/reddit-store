I worked full time, kept food in the house, but wasn't prepared to be making a healthy meal, at 9:15 pm because that's when a kid wanted to eat.  \n\nFresh fruit would go bad in the fridge.

I did not have the time to scoot into the grocery store to buy small quantities of fruits etc so that they would get eaten before going bad.\n\nMy \"food\" stores began to focus more on quick, easy, microwave stuff because I was not their on-call chef.  And they didn't feel like the leftovers from real dinners.\n\nSo ... The fact that OP was 16 when the healthy food stopped, sits pretty much on schedule.\n\nOP ...

The 20 year old is in university and is living at home until he graduates. We cook healthy three times a week for both of our kids but the other four days they fend for themselves. On those days the only food we provide is mac n cheese and regular cheddar. Our oldest has been complaining for years that there is no healthy food available four days a week and has requested to take part in the food planning and cooking. We've told him if he wants to contribute to meal plans he'll have to pay for it with his part time job he has on top of full time studies and we will continue to only provide kraft dinner and cheddar otherwise. He says its not healthy for our 12 year old to eat kraft dinner four times a week. \n\nBTW combined me and my wife make 200k a year. Are we the assholes for only providing fruit, vegetables, grains and meat for 15 days a month for our children?'\n\nIf we look lets say three meals a day, 55 of 90 meals are junk food and only 30 contain fruit, veggies, meat and grains. \n\nInfo: Do they seriously not even have rice or quinoa available outside of those meals?

He goes to a four-year university full time and I guarantee his school has work study internships he could be applying for and working if he wants to make decent money. Mine paid $22 an hour. If he\u2019s just going to school and working a part time job, he also definitely has time to do private tutoring or do tutoring through the university for the athletic department which also pays really well. These are options at every state university as well as most private universities. Now I have compared him to myself three years ago when I was also a young person making more than \u201ccrap\u201d. My point was that it\u2019s not categorically true that young people \u201caren\u2019t making crap\u201d and that as a state university student, he also has plenty of opportunities to be making more than \u201ccrap\u201d. Since he has literally no living expenses, being expected to cover his own meals is completely reasonable. Is that better for you?\n\nETA: everyone is downvoting this but no one will actually say why this is at all an unreasonable take.

That means most of his weekly intake is unhealthy.   \n\nIf I were him, I'd just buy my own food, or move out (I left my parents home at 18 which was 100% my choice), but that doesn't help his brother.

I definitely grew up privileged as a middle class white girl, but neither of my parents had ANY contacts in the field I work in.

OP guessed his mom's salary. And also listed before taxes.
