My experience with child free relatives and friends is that they come in three forms: no to children - those who want nothing to do with kids until they're adults, no to  small children - those who don't want relationships with kids until they're walking, talking miniature adults, and no to their own children - those who love other people's kids like their own but don't want kids. Your sister is either the first or second but also has an extreme blindness to the consequences of her complete disinterest or disdain for your child being that you don't want her around your kid and she hasn't earned a relationship with your daughter because of the negativity she expressed and that your daughter knows she is avoided and disliked.\n\nMy husband's best friends are a married couple who are child free. The husband was the oldest of 6 and did a lot of child rearing of his siblings so he never needed to do it again as a father (he is type 3, loves everyone else's kids) and she just does not like small kids, type 2. She has the blindness that makes her sad that our child always prefers  her husband. He held our daughter as a baby, plays with her constantly and babysat for us but the wife avoided her before she was 5 or 6. The feeling of being avoided was not lost on our daughter even when she was small. My kid finally started telling the wife stuff she tells the husband all the time at 7 or 8.

But after they\u2019re 7,8 years that changes drastically and I\u2019m able to enjoy them\u2026 so, is it possible that your daughter is \u201cold enough\u201d for your sister and maybe that\u2019s why she wants to tag along?", "NTA.

Sis has been uncaring & insulting toward your DD & that behavior doesn\u2019t deserve forgiveness.", "NTA \n\nThere is no requirement to take extended family members on an immediate family trip. \n\nYour sister has no interest in your daughter, to the point of putting your life in danger to avoid interacting with her. \n\nNot to mention, I strongly recommend against taking a \"Disney Adult\" along on a once-in-a-childhood trip.

Disney is NOT the place for someone so aggressively childfree to try \"bonding\". Nor is it a good trip to try to mend a ruptured relationship. Disney is a blast, but it's so stressful. Even the calmest tempers can run short when you're exhausted with sore feet. No way your sister will be helpful when your daughter is tired and cranky at the end of the day. Bringing her along will just make things worse and possibly ruin this once-in-a-lifetime trip for your daughter.", "NTA - if she wants to extend an olive branch, she needs to do it when your daughter is NOT involved.  This isn't extending an olive branch.  This is trying to piggy back on someone else's trip.  This trip needs to be between you and your daughter and no one else.

Many of their rides are beautifully crafted and use their popular IPs in them. The atmosphere in the park is amazing. \n\nEveryone should at least ride the \"flight of passage\" ride at animal kingdom. You dont have to go to the other parks. Just ride that one. It was so beautiful it made me and others cry. Shit it made my dad cry and i have never seen him cry. Best roller coaster ever. It's very unique and brilliant. You are guaranteed  to have a smile on your face. And be very sad that it's over...\n\nUniversal is great too , and they're starting to catch up to disney when it comes to quality. But I would still recommend the flight of passage over any ride at Universal.", "Have you ever been? Not asking snarkily, but it is a unique experience.\n\nIt's one of the most expensive theme parks in the world with shows, rides, experiences, and a full cast of characters working to improve the experience. It includes IP that has been around since the 30s so it has nostalgia feel for pretty much everyone who visits in the countries that it operates and it goes all out to make it feel magical despite the same epic queues and the hard sell on overpriced food and trinkets that every other theme park suffers from. Even if you don't particularly love Disney, its still ahead of other parks just for that. \n\nAnd for the Disney properties, who says they have to only be for kids? What's wrong with enjoying something simple and wholesome? It's just innocent fun, even if it's not for you, why make a big deal out of other people enjoying it?", "I'll look some of these up. But have you ever been to 6 flags?", "Nope, I've never been into Disney as a kid either.\n\nI think I kind of get what you mean when you mention the shows there and how the park is big. But I just see am adult enjoying these things. Maybe it's bvuz I don't have kids. The whole theme of Disney doesn't appeal to me at all. \n\nLet's be honest brother, they cater to kids more than to adults. Nothing wrong with that. I just couldn't wrap my head around adults enjoying that."]}
