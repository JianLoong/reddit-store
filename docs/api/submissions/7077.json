My experience with child free relatives and friends is that they come in three forms: no to children - those who want nothing to do with kids until they're adults, no to  small children - those who don't want relationships with kids until they're walking, talking miniature adults, and no to their own children - those who love other people's kids like their own but don't want kids. Your sister is either the first or second but also has an extreme blindness to the consequences of her complete disinterest or disdain for your child being that you don't want her around your kid and she hasn't earned a relationship with your daughter because of the negativity she expressed and that your daughter knows she is avoided and disliked.\n\nMy husband's best friends are a married couple who are child free. The husband was the oldest of 6 and did a lot of child rearing of his siblings so he never needed to do it again as a father (he is type 3, loves everyone else's kids) and she just does not like small kids, type 2. She has the blindness that makes her sad that our child always prefers  her husband. He held our daughter as a baby, plays with her constantly and babysat for us but the wife avoided her before she was 5 or 6. The feeling of being avoided was not lost on our daughter even when she was small. My kid finally started telling the wife stuff she tells the husband all the time at 7 or 8.

But after they\u2019re 7,8 years that changes drastically and I\u2019m able to enjoy them\u2026 so, is it possible that your daughter is \u201cold enough\u201d for your sister and maybe that\u2019s why she wants to tag along?", "NTA.

Sis has been uncaring & insulting toward your DD & that behavior doesn\u2019t deserve forgiveness.", "NTA \n\nThere is no requirement to take extended family members on an immediate family trip. \n\nYour sister has no interest in your daughter, to the point of putting your life in danger to avoid interacting with her. \n\nNot to mention, I strongly recommend against taking a \"Disney Adult\" along on a once-in-a-childhood trip.

Disney is NOT the place for someone so aggressively childfree to try \"bonding\". Nor is it a good trip to try to mend a ruptured relationship. Disney is a blast, but it's so stressful. Even the calmest tempers can run short when you're exhausted with sore feet. No way your sister will be helpful when your daughter is tired and cranky at the end of the day. Bringing her along will just make things worse and possibly ruin this once-in-a-lifetime trip for your daughter.", "NTA - if she wants to extend an olive branch, she needs to do it when your daughter is NOT involved.  This isn't extending an olive branch.  This is trying to piggy back on someone else's trip.  This trip needs to be between you and your daughter and no one else.

I won't necessarily jump to the conclusion that this about your sister and her love of Disney....because it seems she can clearly go whenever she wants. Though people who suspect this are =definitely= not wrong.   \n\n\nThat being said....you do not personally have the cash to make it up to your daughter if this trip goes to hell. Your #1 priority should be 100% your daughter's experience. \n\nIMO your daughters 1st trip experience is much more important than your relationship with your sister.", "NTA nope she doesn't like your daughter and will make your trip hell.", "NTA go with your daughter and have fun.  Your sister is not your responsibility.  Chances are good she will screw up the vacation for both you and your daughter", "Nta", " NTA. This trip is for your daughter who gets to pick the rides and everything. If you invite you evil spawn of a sister \ud83d\ude08 on the trip it will no longer be about your daughter.", "NTA\n\n\nIf this is really her apologizing then she would and should straight out just apologize. This is the consequences of her actions and she's just gonna have to face them. She had years to try and bond and refused. What got me was her refusing to even watch your daughter for a bit when one of your organs ruptured inside you???? Yeah. You don't owe her an extension of any branch.", "If your sister calls your kid a spawn on a good day then Disney will be a miserable experience if you take her. The days are long and the lines can be longer. Kid's get tired and can't power through like the Disney-Adults....\n\nFor your daughters sake stick to your guns. Or Auntie will blow up the first time she needs to take a break because her feet hurt or she's hungry instead of wanting to go on a ride.\n\nNTA", "Neither of you will enjoy this trip if you all go. NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. The only reason she\u2019s interested at all is because Disney is involved. If she went she\u2019d complain about you two not getting to do anything she sees as fun because your daughter is in the way. She\u2019d probably try and push for you to hire a sitter and leave her behind. And I\u2019m betting she\u2019s expecting to stay in the room you already paid for. Don\u2019t share details with her and make sure the hotel won\u2019t allow anyone else to change or cancel your reservation. \n\nHas it been a while since she\u2019s been? Maybe she can\u2019t really afford another trip and is looking for someone to foot the bill as much as possible.", "NTA,\n\nSorry love, your sister sounds like a dick. Maybe tell her this?", ">My mom thinks this is my sister trying to extend an olive branch\n\nYour sister has had 9 years to extend the olive branch of shared Disney fandom to your daughter, and has opted not to. Including during **her own** multiple trips to Disney parks.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Sounds like ulterior motives and will either ditch you the second you get to the park or complain the whole time about only doing the things your daughter wants to, I\u2019m assuming your daughter wants will be prioritized. Stick to your guns and only go with your daughter. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a much more enjoyable and memorable experience", "Please, don't invite your sister, and do not tell her when you're going. Don't let anyone know when, just tell them when you get back.\n\nNTA.", "Oh please don't invite her. If this goes wrong there will be no second trip for you and your daughter. If she's actually interested in restoring the relationship she should start with understanding she can't come to such an important trip after how she acted towards your daughter. NTA", "NTA at all", "NTA. Don\u2019t do it.", "NTA.  If the sister were to go, I'd think she'd do 1 of 2 things - either ditch OP and daughter each day to do her own thing or to take over the trip and be pushed to only do things the sister wants to do.\n\nEither one sucks and OP should only take her daughter on this special trip.", "NTA. A trip to Disney with kids is very different than one with adults. You\u2019ve been working so hard and saving so hard for this trip, you don\u2019t want it to be ruined by your sister\u2019s attitude. If she truly wants to make amends and get closer, this trip is not the first time to try it out. Also, there should be a test period. See if she can spend time with your daughter, and forget being civil, be kind to her.", "Nta. Don't do the crime of you can't do the time. Talk shit, be ready for a hit. Be dumb, get the thumb.", "NTA - Tell your sister that you want to start LOCALLY.  See if she wants to spend time with you and your daughter without the Disneyfication.  See if she will.", "NTa sister wants a free trip.", "NTA. It isnt an olive branch, shes being self serving because she likes Disney and wants to go. To fall for her \"this a great bonding opportunity\" it is BS. And she will totally ruin a holiday you've toiled to save for.", "INFO: What is your sister offering? Is she paying? Will she be upgrading your trip in any way?\n\n\"Hey, I want to treat you and my niece to the VIP tour as well as a suite at the Grand Floridian\" might be an olive branch, otherwise she's looking for a free trip.", "so NTA, your sister sounds exhausting AF and completely unreliable, don't take her with you as she will try to hijack your trip and make it all about her and ruin the whole experience for your daughter.", "NTA. Take your daughter and have the best time ever, a memory you can both share forever.\n\nYour sister appears selfish and unkind. Not watching your daughter when you had a burst appendix? GTFOH", "NTA. she is totally going to ruin the mood for your child, so it won\u00b4t be a travel to be remembered fondly", "She\u2019s both aggressively child-free *and* a Disney Adult. She\u2019s *both* of those things. \n\nNTA, op. Good luck", "This exactly. She's going to want to run the show and direct all your plans, and not care at all what your daughter wants to do.\n\nLeave sister behind and enjoy this trip with your daughter!", "NTA. The way solo adults go to Disney parks is vastly different than the way children with parents go to Disney park, she'll just make it miserable for you and your daughter. So no, she can go on her own.", "I\u2019m an adult who loves Disneyland. I had a lot of fun going with my young niblings and watching them enjoy the magic, but it was completely different from going with my adult friends. \n\nWith little kids, you\u2019re stopping more often, you\u2019re probably not going on the more intense rides, they\u2019re going to get impatient in lines and shops, and they\u2019re going to tire out when a group of adults would be ready to keep going. But when you\u2019re at Disney with kids, the trip is about tue kids. \n\nLike I said, I had a blast going to Disney with my niblings, but that\u2019s because I deeply enjoy my niblings as people and my affection for them overruled the more frustrating moments. OP\u2019s sister doesn\u2019t have that bond with her niece, so I don\u2019t know that she\u2019d be willing to put aside her own idea of a fun Disney trip in favor of making the trip fun for the niece. NTA.", "Likewise, if sister really wants to bond, and make changes, she can do it locally, not on your special trip.", "NTA.\n\n Don\u2019t bring her, it sounds like she is jealous of your daughter and would change the dynamics of your trip in a bad way.", "NTA.\n\nIf you want to tweak her nose, you could ask if all those missed opportunities to get to know her niece was so she could save up to take y\u2019all to Disney. Might be assholeish though. ;)", "God, you just know the sister is going to demand they do a bunch of absolute bullshit that she learned about from Disney adult influencers.", "Hating children to the point of calling them spawn and then spending all your money on expensive trips to a park made for children", "EXACTLY THIS! She wants the children\u2019s experience without having a child. \n\nNTA obviously! I have gone to events with my kid and my friends who don\u2019t have kids (and they LIKE kids and want their own some day). The patience required to experience something with a child is different. For example:\n1) bathroom breaks \n2) the characters they wanna meet don\u2019t align with characters you/friends think are cool \n3) when they love a ride they wanna go 3 more times right away. That\u2019s either a conversation that needs To happen (eg. line is her long, we don\u2019t have a fast pass for that time) or you line up again. \n4) money.What if she wants to buy expensive snacks and souvenirs? How will you tell your daughter that she can\u2019t have some? Or even if your daughter is amazing, mature and understanding it will make her feel less special on a trip that is for her. \n5) she doesn\u2019t really have a relationship with aunt and this is not the time to build it.", ">ass holder despite living in Chicago. Regardless, ever since she heard about the trip she's been asking to go saying that it'll be a fun bonding experience for, \"all us girls.\" I've been telling her no because she hates my daughter and I don't want her to ruin the trip. My mom thinks this is my sister trying to extend an olive branch and I should take it but I don't know. AITA for not inviting my sister on this trip?\n\nYes this this this.  Don't try bonding on a trip away from home where you can't really get a break from each other.  Start with lunch at a cafe in your city.", "Yea teacups are for looser!!", "Ditto. I have no children, and never wanted them, but I would absolutely help a friend or relative by watching their kid(s) so they could take a shower, or a much-needed nap, or run an important errand or two, and I honestly can't imagine being so selfish as to refuse to watch someone's child because the parent needs to go to the emergency room!! Jeez... OP's sister is lucky that OP is willing to have any contact with her at all, ever.", "Yeah, I realized young that the literal inanimate objects I wanted were more important to me, to the point I was pretty sure I would resent having kids who logically needed things I would then have to spend the bulk of my money on...the mere thought of which horrified me to my soul, but was nevertheless true.   \nSo no kids, but my respect to people who can handle it! (And to friends and relatives who let me spoil their kids!)"]}
