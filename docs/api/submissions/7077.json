My experience with child free relatives and friends is that they come in three forms: no to children - those who want nothing to do with kids until they're adults, no to  small children - those who don't want relationships with kids until they're walking, talking miniature adults, and no to their own children - those who love other people's kids like their own but don't want kids. Your sister is either the first or second but also has an extreme blindness to the consequences of her complete disinterest or disdain for your child being that you don't want her around your kid and she hasn't earned a relationship with your daughter because of the negativity she expressed and that your daughter knows she is avoided and disliked.\n\nMy husband's best friends are a married couple who are child free. The husband was the oldest of 6 and did a lot of child rearing of his siblings so he never needed to do it again as a father (he is type 3, loves everyone else's kids) and she just does not like small kids, type 2. She has the blindness that makes her sad that our child always prefers  her husband. He held our daughter as a baby, plays with her constantly and babysat for us but the wife avoided her before she was 5 or 6. The feeling of being avoided was not lost on our daughter even when she was small. My kid finally started telling the wife stuff she tells the husband all the time at 7 or 8.

But after they\u2019re 7,8 years that changes drastically and I\u2019m able to enjoy them\u2026 so, is it possible that your daughter is \u201cold enough\u201d for your sister and maybe that\u2019s why she wants to tag along?", "NTA.

Sis has been uncaring & insulting toward your DD & that behavior doesn\u2019t deserve forgiveness.", "NTA \n\nThere is no requirement to take extended family members on an immediate family trip. \n\nYour sister has no interest in your daughter, to the point of putting your life in danger to avoid interacting with her. \n\nNot to mention, I strongly recommend against taking a \"Disney Adult\" along on a once-in-a-childhood trip.

Disney is NOT the place for someone so aggressively childfree to try \"bonding\". Nor is it a good trip to try to mend a ruptured relationship. Disney is a blast, but it's so stressful. Even the calmest tempers can run short when you're exhausted with sore feet. No way your sister will be helpful when your daughter is tired and cranky at the end of the day. Bringing her along will just make things worse and possibly ruin this once-in-a-lifetime trip for your daughter.", "NTA - if she wants to extend an olive branch, she needs to do it when your daughter is NOT involved.  This isn't extending an olive branch.  This is trying to piggy back on someone else's trip.  This trip needs to be between you and your daughter and no one else.

Your daughter is the focus of this trip for you.", "NTA.\n\nI know you're not looking for advice, but here's what I wish you would tell your mom:\n\n\"Mom, I'm sure you wish your daughters got along like they used to, but I think your hope has clouded your judgment here. The whole reason Sister and I have a strained relationship is because she treats my daughter with disdain for merely existing. I've planned and saved for this trip for years, for my daughter and I only. Sister hasn't apologized for her previous behavior. nor offered to pay her way. She just wants an excuse to go to Disney. This is not an olive branch, it is an attempt to take advantage of me and she is manipulating you and I both. **There is no way in hell I am bringing her, someone who historically hates my daughter, on a trip *for my daughter*.\"**\n\nAnd to your sister: \"The answer is no. If you sincerely want 'all us girls' to bond, apologize for your awful behavior and plan something else. This trip is only for my spawn and I.\"", "NTA, your sister completely refuses to be alone with your daughter, why would she want to spend an extended amount of time near ALL THOSE KIDS?!?!", "Interesting that your sister has all this interest and access to Disney parks but never invited you or her daughter.  Her choice, right. \n\nHowever you saving for years to pay for this experience with your daughter is YOUR choice.  \n\nTell your mother that is sis really is offering an olive branch, let it be her using her membership to support a trip.  \n\nShe has not apologized or in any way let you know that she wants to spend time with you and your daughter.  If you include her on this trip, it is likely she will be annoyed and impatient with your daughter and with you for wanting the trip to be centered on tour daughter.  I would not trust her to be operating with good will.", "NTA but I\u2019m convinced your sister is a member here because the \u201cI have no obligation to provide free babysitting\u201d is something all of the AHs here loooove to throw around.", "She can keep that olive branch and extend it another day. Not on the trip you planned and saved just for your daughter. NTA. She can go by herself. She's 28.", "NTA\n\nLet her extend that olive branch at some other time and some other place", "Nope!!!! This is a special trip for you and your daughter! Say no and mean it! Then tell them you will not discuss it any further.", "NTA - do not invite her. This is a mother daughter trip. She wants nothing to do with said daughter so do not bring her. She will make it all about her.", "Many people who choose to be childfree are very loving aunts, uncles, siblings, etc. your sister doesn\u2019t fit that description. \n\nYour sister\u2019s childfree perspective is so hostile to kids that she allowed a close  bond with you to wither when you became a mother.  She was militantly disinterested in your daughter. Many childfree people are fantastic aunts and uncles to the children of siblings.  She is a big Disney fan and has enjoyed Disney for a king time but never once invited you to go with her when she went.  Why, all of a sudden, is she so hot to bond on YOUR first trip with your child?\n\nYou miss your sister and the relationship you once had.  She apparently resented your having a child and also resented your child.  Has she considered your daughter a rival?  \n\nPlease don\u2019t trust her on this trip.  You have saved for years.  This is for you and your daughter.  Just the two of you making memories that you will both have for the rest of your lives.  \n\nIf your sister tags along, with her history of resentment, you are taking a big risk. Why would you want to do that.  Let this be for you and your daughter alone because you know the two of you will have the best time.  Let your sister offer a real peace offering; something that proves good will.  \n\nYour daughter is growing up.  In time, your sister may decide she isn\u2019t such a kid and will want a relationship with her.  Let her figure that out. \n\nEven if your sister has changed her mind, let her demonstrate that.  She doesn\u2019t know your daughter, does she?", "NTA. \n\nEven if its the sister extending an olive branch, you don't have to go on a whole ass trip with her. Parents and kids are allowed to have their own bonding experience, without other family members swooshing in.", "I think some people get so caught up on being \"child free\" that they forget that kids are people... and the same kids that they shun in childhood will shun them as they become older. \n\nThe sister openly dislikes OP's daughter and treats her with disdain. If the sister treated any adult like that I'm sure they would tell her to F-off the minute she tried suddedly get all buddy buddy to get something that she wants. Why should a child have to put up with someone that an adult wouldn't?..", "Just imagine the fit she\u2019d throw if OP needs to pee and asks the sister to stand with her while she does", "Yep.  Do not let this kind of Disney adult come on your once in a lifetime trip.  These are the people that get annoyed that children are at a cartoon themed amusement park.  You already know you'll regret it.  Your mom is just wishful thinking.", "This is the best response.", "Bad bot! You stole this comment from another user!", "Lots of times, parents will accept \"the child is not in immediate danger\", especially if it's that or have them watch you deal with your medical emergency.", "This is the real magic for adults lol", "I\u2019m over here laughing like a 12 year old \ud83d\ude02", "Disney definitely caters to adults as well. Their primary goal is to make money, and adults spend the most money, even those without children. It might not be your thing, but it's kind of like asking \"why do you enjoy this television show that I don't like\" or anything else that you don't like. Different people just enjoy different things, it's as simple as that.", "There's no comparison between Disney and amusement parks like 6 flags.  And I don't mean one is better than they other,  they are just completely different.  Disney isn't just about the rides,  it's the whole immersive experience. The atmosphere, the music,  the food,  its all designed to be part of the experience.  I haven't been to Disney in years,  but I still remember walking through the gates felt like walking into another world.  Theres  a magic about it.  And that being said,  I'm sure it's not for everyone.", "Ive been to Disneyworld and Disneyland and Ive been to multiple 6 Flags, as well as several other theme parks.  Disney is a whole other class.  And really, except for Magic Kingdom, the parks really are designed to be just as good for adults.  In the case of Epcot, even more for adults.  6 flags is fun, but it feels like a theme park.  It isnt immersive, it isnt all encompassing.  Disney really is the most magical place on earth - like walking into a book where real life recedes back.", "NTA. Aggressively childfree people SUCK. I had an aunt like that. She was HATEFUL. Called us crotchfruit and cum pets and shit. She was always hyper critical and looking for a reason to tear us down. But for some reason: this lady bought us the coolest toys. So we dealt with her. It was like she only dealt with us as an excuse to buy/try out new cool stuff that would be weird without kids. Then she'd go back to being hateful. \n\nYou never knew what you were gonna get with her. \nAs an adult, we don't communicate. When I had my daughter she ripped me a new one and told me I was ruining my life, and that I shouldn't be a parent. Even going as far as saying I was a horrible child so I will be a horrible parent. \n\nMy daughter will NEVER meet this woman. \nFuck having child haters around your children. Blood isn't as important as actions. Imo. It's been over 6 years since we've talked and I don't miss her hateful ass.\n\n\nYour sister is going to make Disney about her whether she goes or not. I'd rather have a good trip with a mad sister back home than a shitty trip with a mad sister throwing fits at Disneyworld.\n\nAlso: taking kids to Disney is waaaaaay more stressful than going as an adult without kids. It's frustrating even for me and I was a preschool teacher. I would NOOOT take a childfree Disney freak with me.", "NTA. I am passionately childfree, and I truly don\u2019t get a)why a childfree person would even want to go to Disney and be surrounded by children at every turn and b) why anyone who\u2019s treated you like this would ever expect to be invited.", "NTA. And tell her exactly why. If she wants to do special things with your family, she needs to stop being horrible first, not go with the hope that she'll stop being horrible.", "NTA\n\nThat's no olive branch sister is extending.  She is actually reaching for a handout.  She wants OP to subsidize her lodging *at a minimum*.  Then will complain the whole time because \"spawn\" wants to do \"spawn\"-ish things.  She is this way because your mother has raised her to think her desires are all that matters.\n\nDon't do it.", "NTA! I doubt she\u2019s wanting to bond with your daughter. She doesn\u2019t even really know her. What\u2019s changed that suddenly her behavior would include your daughter? Disney might be the most magical place on earth but I highly doubt it can change the wicked aunt. Every Disney story has a villain. Guess what? Usually something unpleasant happens to them. Let\u2019s not make Disney the most unhappy place on earth for your daughter.", "NTA. Your instincts are right. Enjoy the time with your daughter.", "Where was mom when you were in the ER?\n\nScrew Sis,, screw Mom.  NTA", "She\u2019s a selfish opportunist. Sorry, but barring something catastrophic, your sister isn\u2019t going to change. (And although she would disagree, you going to Disney without her isn\u2019t a catastrophe)", "NTA. Your mom should butt out. I don't see her try to correct the sister's asshole and hostile behavior to your daughter. I would cut all contact with the sister.", "NTA. One shouldn't have to pay for the olive branch that's being extended to one.", "NTA.  An olive branch involves giving the other party a peace offering, not demanding that they give you something.\n\nNot to mention, a trip to Disney with your daughter is probably going to at some point involve \"Hey, I need to run to the bathroom, can you watch daughter?\"  At which point she'll go nuclear.\n\nActually, a fun (but terrible idea) would be to go \"Hey, I'd love to have you come and supervise my daughter on this trip, spend lots of time doing what she wants, just really bond and give her anything she asks for like a good aunt.  You're on board with that?\"\n\n(Again, terrible idea, she might accept, do not do this)", "NTA. even if she did watch your daughter, she's not entitled to go with you lol she can pay for her own trip and shouldn't try to guilt trip you.

Do not used a important trip with your daughter to try and re bond with your sister. Don\u2019t be guilted into it. It will be at the expense of your daughter", "Your sister is using you. NTA", "Nta. Go enjoy your trip. She\u2019ll try to control the whole thing saying she\u2019s been there and knows what\u2019s best instead of what your daughter wants to do", "There is nothing stopping your sister from booking a room and buying tickets for the same time frame that you are going. \n\nIf she really wants to make it a \"girls trip\", she can do that. She can buy a plane/train/bus ticket for herself to get to Florida. Or pay for gas money for herself if she's driving. \n\nShe can book a room in the same hotel you're staying at. If you tell her your floor, she can even request for a room on the same floor as you. \n\nShe can buy park tickets for the same day that you're going. \n\nThere is absolutely nothing preventing her from doing any of these things. \n\nI guess my question is, would you be happy to let her join in if she happened to bump into you at Disney? Or would you walk away?\n\nYour mother might be right. Your sister might actually be trying to extend an olive branch. If she is though, she needs to put the effort in for that. Which means respecting your boundaries. \n\nSo if you sister wants to share a room with you at Disney and control the agenda, I would say hard-pass. \n\nBut if she wants to join you for a few hours at Disney (at her own expense), and let you experience Disney on your terms, that's another thing. \n\nNTA\n\nJust hear her out. Is she willing to pay her own way? Or is she going to demand to share your room since \"you already paid for it.\"?", "NTA, please stand your ground and don't allow your sister to join you. You and your daughter deserve a fun trip that you worked very hard for. I can see your sister being rude and mean to your daughter if she were to join you on this trip. She can grab dinner with you to extend the olive branch if she truly wants to mend the relationship.", "NTA And absolutely not. She doesn\u2019t get to hate your child and then invite herself to you and your daughter\u2019s trip.", "NTA AND HELL FUCKING NO! You\u2019re not going to shun my baby and then want to be around bc it benefits you. Don\u2019t put your daughter in that situation. Your sister will have another opportunity to extend an olive branch", "NTA. Enjoy a special trip with your daughter. Your sister will take away from quality time with your girl.", "NTA. Tell her it\u2019s a mother daughter trip and she is neither of those to you.  Should get the point across.  As for your mother, your sister could never make up for her horrid behavior and she is lucky you even speak to her at all.", "Please don\u2019t take your sister. She cares Nothing for her niece or You. If she did she wouldn\u2019t say those hurtful things. NTA.", "NTA. She\u2019s jumping on the opportunity to use you and your daughter for a trip to Disney.

Have the best time with your daughter!", "Unless your sister pays for the whole trip she is not extending an olive branch. \n\nJust say this is mother daughter time and that it would be great to go on an all hit trip next time \n\n\nWhich will be many years later lol", "Nta- no one should invite themselves on someone else\u2019s trip. You got feeling is that your sister is not going to make this a happy trip for you, and just like at home she is only going to be worried about herself at the Disney park on a trip that\u2019s intended for your daughter. I would certainly explain that in the past, she hasn\u2019t wanted to be troubled with the inconvenience of your \u201cspawn\u201d and frankly, that attitude is not going to be enjoyable during your Disney trip. She just has to understand that. I would also point out that she\u2019s been to Disney several times without you and your \u201cspawn\u201d for all of the reasons she has previously stated to you. As the saying goes if you want to have a friend you have to be a friend. If you want to be treated as \u201cone of the girls\u201d you should start acting like it. She doesn\u2019t so she isn\u2019t coming. It seems pretty obvious that she wants to share in the cost so it\u2019s cheaper for her and that\u2019s probably her only reason for the suggestion. She is only interested in a benefit for her, not anyone else. That\u2019s her track record and she have to live with it", "NTA. Go with your daughter and make it a trip to remember - just the 2 of you.", "NTA Don't risk this special and unique event for your daughter and yourself. When she really changed and wants to make peace she can do that outside of Disneyland.", "Yeah, this is not an olive branch. Its just another reason to go to the park. With her extreme hatred of children, I'm surprised she can even tolerate going there.\n\nSidenote: it's perfectly fine to not want children, but it's incredibly obnoxious when people make it their entire personality.", "I wouldn\u2019t risk the entire trip on the possibility of bonding\u2026. NTA.", "Sis needs to spend time with daughter in town together before committing to the Disney trip. They should tell her if she would feel differently if they were going to Legoland instead and explain this trip will be as equally about the kid as Legoland would be. NTA.", "This is a great break down of the different types of child free. I\u2019m the 3rd. I raised my little brothers and didn\u2019t get to be a kid. So I very much like not being responsible for kids now. But I babysit my friends twins all the time and have since they were born and I adore my niece and nephews and hang out with them as much as possible. I get to be the cool aunt. One of my brothers and his wife and type 1 and 2. Now that one of my nephews is older they tried to pay attention to him and he ignores them like they used to ignore him.", "^^ THIS! Im a Disneyland loving child free millennial \ud83e\udd23 Granted the difference is I love my niblings, godchildren and my friends\u2019 kids.  I have happily but VERY anxiously babysat but always willing if possible.  But I\u2019m more anxious like don\u2019t get hurt! So here is the deal, when you go with younger kids then you follow THEIR lead.  You want to watch the parade but the kid wants to do a ride? Or vice versa\u2026.you kinda do what they want. They will get tired, get hungry, etc.  A parade or show may be halfway through and they need a bathroom ASAP or getting overwhelmed. So if your sister cannot handle following the whims of a child, then she really shouldn\u2019t go.  You really need to go in with that mindset and then the day is actually pretty great. \n\nBut honestly just say it\u2019s a Mother/Daughter trip only.  Though \u201cnext time\u201d you guys go you will make sure to tell her. Lol. But I\u2019m sorry OP about your sister in general.  But I\u2019d say she isn\u2019t child free as much as she is more Anti-Children overall.  I don\u2019t want kids myself, BUT I love other people\u2019s kids instead \ud83d\ude02 \n\nEdit- Hit save too soon \ud83e\udd23", "Also don't tell her mom! She seems way too invested in this \"olive branch\" idea.", "Bad bot, stolen comment.", "I finally caved and started getting a wheelchair at theme parks, etc. I walk with a cane due to fibromyalgia and sciatica from a degenerative spinal condition and just could not keep up. Using the wheelchair the park provides has saved me so much pain and exhaustion. I highly recommend it for anyone who has back problems or trouble walking or even if you just get fatigued very easily. It's an absolute game changer and has allowed me to actually enjoy those places again.", "I\u2019m young and possibly always going to be child free but babysit for family friends, relatives, etc often. I think it\u2019s fun to hang out with kids for a bit and then get to give them back! You get to be the interesting and fun new grown up who orders pizza and will participate in a water gun fight or get elbow deep into glitter crafts with them. \n\nIdk it just makes me happy to be able to see them happy while also letting a friend get out of the house for a bit. I feel like babysitters get to do activities with them that parents are often to busy to fully devote time to.", "I could see it. Not a cryer myself but some of the effects are just unreal, especially on the newer rides."]}
