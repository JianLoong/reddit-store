You could easily have just said that she is more established because she inherited stuff from her dead parents, and if your in-laws were willing to die soon than you and your husband could also be established.

Jealousy isn\u2019t a great look for what it\u2019s worth. She got the estate because she was legally entitled to it. Her parents had a will so they saw an attorney to get it right? It\u2019s not hard to disinherit someone. They just didn\u2019t do it. Maybe they verbally threatened her or tried to use money as a bribe. But ultimately they didn\u2019t actually disinherit her. It sounds like they weren\u2019t good people so verbal threats sound perfectly reasonable to them.    It doesn\u2019t mean anything legally. So she didn\u2019t steal anything. \n\nAs for the house. As is without an inspection? That was an expensive lesson they learned. This woman grew up in an abusive or otherwise crappy childhood situation. I\u2019m not thinking she took a leveler and checked the floors. And she moved out. What if the issues happened after she moved out? Her parents neglected their home the way they neglected their will I guess. She settled their estate by selling a home she didn\u2019t want. Even assuming she saw the floors weren\u2019t level, most people don\u2019t leap to the conclusion it was worthy of being condemned. Flooring can be uneven for different reasons you know. \n\nYou literally look at everything in her life with the most negative view possible. She is the mother of your husband\u2019s daughter. It\u2019s time to let this go. You\u2019ve got a lot of hate festering in you. The issue is your husband\u2019s parents being AHs to him. They haven\u2019t died and left him an estate and a house to sell so he\u2019s in a different position than his ex. Fight with them and leave her out of it.

I think you went way overboard with the court records.  So she was involved in litigation.

No scenario in which a kid gets a share of their parents estate because they were left out of the will would void the underlying will itself. There are very specific and limited situations that can void a properly executed will, the assets purported to be distributed in the will were not assets the testator had a right to bequeath as they wished, or the will was never actually properly executed.

Given that testimony indicated she was an omitted child or suggested it (other outcomes could be that the will predates her birth or the evidence was not seen as that reliable) but the will was overall VOIDED means there is something else going on too. 2) there was some issue with the validity of the will document itself - maybe it wasn\u2019t properly executed or there was evidence of the testators not being of sound mind or being unduly influenced etc .

It\u2019s a guiding principle and if a court completely decides to invalidate a document meant to represent a decedent\u2019s final wishes - they don\u2019t tend to do this lightly.

Additionally, she never insisted on selling the house as-is, the incompetent buyers did and took the risk of it being unsafe when they did so. \n\nSo no theft or fraud. What did you think the court papers were going to prove? That you lack reading comprehension, are ignorant of the law and that you essentially are petty and jealous? Good job on confirming to your in-laws that you are incompetent. \n\nYTA", "\n\nShe made a new account... Lol... She posted this/ similar yesterday on a step parent sub. They are usually pretty hateful on there but she was told the same thing.... Bitter, jealous and obviously disliking the fact her man has child/ren from this accomplished woman.  Spend more time being a better step parent and mind you own dam business sis", "OP, YTA. You are not doing yourself any favours by continuing with this behaviour.\n\nInstead of going out of your way to villanize her, you can just say she comes from money! Someone who inherited thousands and thousands of dollars will likely be in a better financial position than you. Printing court documents and trying to convince people she is a thief is just petty and full of jealousy.", "ESH\n\nOP is definitely an AH.  Your behavior is petty, bitter, and jealous.  The BM didn\u2019t lie, cheat, and steal.  That\u2019s how the law works.  Furthermore, instead of resenting how she got her money, try being happy for your stepdaughter that she has opportunities and resources available to her.  How wonderful for the baby!\n\nThe reason I say ESH is because OP isn\u2019t the only AH.  The in laws are awful.  Making snide comments about how much better off the mom is is just gross.  And when mom\u2019s wealth comes from inheritance, it\u2019s gross and stupid.  By their logic, they\u2019re the ones who failed by not dying and leaving their son a nice estate.  \n\nPeople who demean and minimize their children by comparing them to others and pointing out the ways that they fall short breed resentment and jealousy.  The fact that dad just accepts this as the cost he has to pay to be good enough to be invited to Christmas tells you just how successful his parents have been in their emotional abuse.", "Sounds like you should be mad at your inlaws, not someone who had such shitty parents they tried to leave her with nothing.", "This - major INFO missing\n\nOP YTA cause it\u2019s not your place. This was your ego rearing an ugly head.\n\nMaybe his ex knew how to work the system, or maybe the system worked her (abusive childhood) and she fought back to get where she is. It\u2019s not your place to judge. \n\nIt is your place to work on yourself so others\u2019 successes don\u2019t feel like a slight against you - cause it\u2019s not. His ex doesn\u2019t care what your life is like or what his parents say - don\u2019t throw her under the bus or villainize her cause you\u2019re butthurt you don\u2019t have that.\n\nAnd I\u2019d definitely question your character if you assume a child raised abused was the problem when her parents tried hurting her again with the inheritance - the fact she found a way to get hers despite the abuse is not fraud, it\u2019s survival. She survived.\n\nI hope you shape up cause I doubt your husband wants to be growing more hateful toward others with your negative support - and end up alienated from his family more than his situation has caused him to be to date. Your support is meant to help build each other up and out of this situation - not cement him in it like he couldn\u2019t achieve more cause he had to be corrupt like his ex to do so. That\u2019s not at all helpful - to anyone - and trust me many people survive without being corrupt and unethical. You\u2019re simply lashing out instead of focusing on your own life and actions. Find your way forward or you will edge yourself out or keep yourself down.", "They didn't inspect. Caveat emptor.\nSo basically ex may not be a great person but has done nothing actually wrong, OP is jealous, and in laws are AHs for constantly comparing the two!", "Sure sounds like you thought about the ways you might have had a claim on it though. \n\nI\u2019m happy you\u2019ve come up empty. Not that your fianc\u00e9 deserves to be in piles of debt or anything, but glad his jealous and vindictive partner can\u2019t take that financial stability away from his daughter.", "Frankly, it sounds like her husband would be better off without OP or his parents.", "Lol none of this is thieving or your fucking business really", "You can't verbally disinherit somebody if there's a will. The will has to be changed.", "The will...you can't \"verbally disinherit\" someone. You can say anything you want,  but if you have a valid will, that's what matters.  Her parents were idiots. Not a loophole, not fraud.  Just the estate being distributed as instructed the written, signed will. The house... if you buy a house as is without getting it inspected you're taking your chances.  She benefitted from others idiocy, but that doesn't make her a criminal.", "Doesnt matter what was said verbally, the will is the final say. You are coming across as jealous and petty.", "That's....that's how wills work. That is literally the law on wills. Also, that's how house buying works, again, it's literally the law. \n\nIf you came to me and presented your complete ignorance as evidence of someone else's supposed failing, I'd write you off as bitter and jealous and frankly, too immature to be a good step parent to my grandchild.", "I purchased a house that I'd never seen in a place I'd never been to during the pandemic. Never saw it in person but we got a conveyancer to check it out plus did multiple video tours. We did our research and the bank had to verify it was a safe purchase in order for us to get a loan because even though we were only borrowing 1/4 purchase price the banks were getting extra cautious.\nMoral of the story, we are super happy with our decision to relocate. Buyer beware and do your research. \nWe ended up selling our previous house for more than $100k over the price it was originally valued at. I didn't defraud the people who now live in it. They got a great house at the price the market valued it at and if they didn't buy we had multiple options to sell for the same price. \n\"As is\" is a gamble.", "Your explanation makes no sense. To legally disinherit her, the parents had to execute a codicil or new will that did that. They didn't. Court was presented with a valid will that apparently was never revoked or superseded. Thus the court followed its terms as it was required to do. There's no fraud and the will would not have been voided but rather enforced.", "Probably an old will is think. Say, from when she was a minor, wording something like, estate goes to minor child X, under care of guardian Y, and she had to contest the guardianship.", "As-is means the buyer takes the property the way it is. If there are structural defects, it's on the buyer to find out before paying because he agreed to buy it the way it is.", "Acknowledging that she's smart is a good step. Now it's time to start working on realizing that you're not nearly as smart as you seem to think that you are.", "Yeap, I can\u2019t imagine having people around me just arguing over if my failure in life is justified or self perpetuated - like I\u2019m not even there, breathing, with feelings - living the failed life they all agree on unanimously.\n\nWhat a group of AHs, IT IS no wonder he\u2019s never got out from under it - with support like that! I hope he sees this and leaves, it really couldn\u2019t get worse probably.", "When the market was at it\u2019s hottest a lot of buyers were forgoing inspections just to get the house. \n\nStill on the buyers for choosing to not have the house inspected.", "If the will was deemed invalid actually which is what op says happened the ex inherited because the parents died intestate technically. Still not a criminal nor is it fraud but the will itself sounds like it didn\u2019t include the ex but that that didn\u2019t matter because it was a legally useless piece of paper and despite the comments about not wanting their estate to go to the ex well as the heir to someone that died without a legal will - she\u2019s entitled to everything.", "As a child, do you remember every bit of DIY/repair that happened to the homes your parents owned/rented?\n\nFrom what you're saying, the court made an appropriate judgement and you really do have sour grapes!", "but why do you care?", "I pulled up my carpet in my council house that a rent and realised there\u2019s a big crack in the middle and I\u2019m only now realising that could be the foundation moving but i thought that was a common thing", "And she'd be, for the 3rd time, very right to do so.", "Exactly my thought, her will, her inheritance, and her family, has nothing to do with op.\n\nIf she was or wasn't in good terms with her parents has nothing to do with op", "Take the L, OP.", "Why do you care so much??", "She sold it as-is, anyone buying that knows there\u2019s going to be a ton of work to do on the house. Nobody forced them to buy it without an inspection, that\u2019s absolutely on them.", "They bought a house without looking at it? Lol. That's on them."]}
