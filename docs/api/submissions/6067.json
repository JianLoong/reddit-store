My fianc\u00e9 on the other hand is buried in student debt, and there's no way we'll ever own a home. \n\nMy in-laws hate the situation with his daughter.

We're currently stuck where we are, so we can't have that much custody right now and they understand that. They never fail to bring up how much more stable her mother is, and always have snide comments about everything she's doing that we couldn't even dream of helping with. \n\nThe truth about her is that she's only financially stable because she's a fucking thief. She stole her parents estate using a loophole to contest the will even though she knew they wanted her to get nothing, and then proceeded to sell their house for 400k more than it was worth by straight up committing fraud.

You can't handle that your in-laws don't hate your partner's BM so you tried to ruin her reputation.

His parents were likely embarrassed after their years of singing her praises. (Even if their approach was nasty.) Did you discuss the plan with your fianc\u00e9?

Channel your jealousy into being a good stepparent and improving your situation.", "YTA. You're being petty and I'm surprised you haven't turned green from envy. Maybe spend less time fixating on her and aim to better your own circumstances. She hasn't done anything illegal, she hasn't stolen or deceived anyone, the courts sided with her. And if you carry on behaving like this the courts may side with her if she decided you and your partner are not fit to have care of her child, because your behavior is toxic, and no child should be exposed to that", "Honestly, ESH. You could easily have just said that she is more established because she inherited stuff from her dead parents, and if your in-laws were willing to die soon than you and your husband could also be established. Outside if that, if she was able to take things via technicalities than she was technically correct to do such and didn't steak anything, even if she did lie about it.", "YTA. Jealousy isn\u2019t a great look for what it\u2019s worth. She got the estate because she was legally entitled to it. Her parents had a will so they saw an attorney to get it right? It\u2019s not hard to disinherit someone. They just didn\u2019t do it. Maybe they verbally threatened her or tried to use money as a bribe. But ultimately they didn\u2019t actually disinherit her. It sounds like they weren\u2019t good people so verbal threats sound perfectly reasonable to them.    It doesn\u2019t mean anything legally. So she didn\u2019t steal anything. \n\nAs for the house. As is without an inspection? That was an expensive lesson they learned. This woman grew up in an abusive or otherwise crappy childhood situation. I\u2019m not thinking she took a leveler and checked the floors. And she moved out. What if the issues happened after she moved out? Her parents neglected their home the way they neglected their will I guess. She settled their estate by selling a home she didn\u2019t want. Even assuming she saw the floors weren\u2019t level, most people don\u2019t leap to the conclusion it was worthy of being condemned. Flooring can be uneven for different reasons you know. \n\nYou literally look at everything in her life with the most negative view possible. She is the mother of your husband\u2019s daughter. It\u2019s time to let this go. You\u2019ve got a lot of hate festering in you. The issue is your husband\u2019s parents being AHs to him. They haven\u2019t died and left him an estate and a house to sell so he\u2019s in a different position than his ex. Fight with them and leave her out of it. The only truth you exposed is your petty jealousy.", "YTA, you\u2019re reeking of jealousy and bitterness.

I think you went way overboard with the court records.  So she was involved in litigation.  It would take me days to figure out what was going on, but apparently the judge agreed with your stepdaughter's mother.\n\nWhile I think they over-reacted (I would have just told you, I don't want to review all these documents), I can see why they were pissed.", "Okay first of all, shitty parents and in-laws. Second, cut them off. And lastly, NTA.", "NTA.  Some people are so impressed by what appears to be financial success nothing else matters to them.
