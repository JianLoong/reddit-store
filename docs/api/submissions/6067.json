You could easily have just said that she is more established because she inherited stuff from her dead parents, and if your in-laws were willing to die soon than you and your husband could also be established.

Jealousy isn\u2019t a great look for what it\u2019s worth. She got the estate because she was legally entitled to it. Her parents had a will so they saw an attorney to get it right? It\u2019s not hard to disinherit someone. They just didn\u2019t do it. Maybe they verbally threatened her or tried to use money as a bribe. But ultimately they didn\u2019t actually disinherit her. It sounds like they weren\u2019t good people so verbal threats sound perfectly reasonable to them.    It doesn\u2019t mean anything legally. So she didn\u2019t steal anything. \n\nAs for the house. As is without an inspection? That was an expensive lesson they learned. This woman grew up in an abusive or otherwise crappy childhood situation. I\u2019m not thinking she took a leveler and checked the floors. And she moved out. What if the issues happened after she moved out? Her parents neglected their home the way they neglected their will I guess. She settled their estate by selling a home she didn\u2019t want. Even assuming she saw the floors weren\u2019t level, most people don\u2019t leap to the conclusion it was worthy of being condemned. Flooring can be uneven for different reasons you know. \n\nYou literally look at everything in her life with the most negative view possible. She is the mother of your husband\u2019s daughter. It\u2019s time to let this go. You\u2019ve got a lot of hate festering in you. The issue is your husband\u2019s parents being AHs to him. They haven\u2019t died and left him an estate and a house to sell so he\u2019s in a different position than his ex. Fight with them and leave her out of it.

I think you went way overboard with the court records.  So she was involved in litigation.  It would take me days to figure out what was going on, but apparently the judge agreed with your stepdaughter's mother.\n\nWhile I think they over-reacted (I would have just told you, I don't want to review all these documents), I can see why they were pissed.", "Okay first of all, shitty parents and in-laws.

No scenario in which a kid gets a share of their parents estate because they were left out of the will would void the underlying will itself. There are very specific and limited situations that can void a properly executed will, the assets purported to be distributed in the will were not assets the testator had a right to bequeath as they wished, or the will was never actually properly executed.

Given that testimony indicated she was an omitted child or suggested it (other outcomes could be that the will predates her birth or the evidence was not seen as that reliable) but the will was overall VOIDED means there is something else going on too. 2) there was some issue with the validity of the will document itself - maybe it wasn\u2019t properly executed or there was evidence of the testators not being of sound mind or being unduly influenced etc .

It\u2019s a guiding principle and if a court completely decides to invalidate a document meant to represent a decedent\u2019s final wishes - they don\u2019t tend to do this lightly.
