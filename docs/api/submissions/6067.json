Maybe spend less time fixating on her and aim to better your own circumstances. She hasn't done anything illegal, she hasn't stolen or deceived anyone, the courts sided with her.

You could easily have just said that she is more established because she inherited stuff from her dead parents, and if your in-laws were willing to die soon than you and your husband could also be established.

Jealousy isn\u2019t a great look for what it\u2019s worth. She got the estate because she was legally entitled to it. Her parents had a will so they saw an attorney to get it right? It\u2019s not hard to disinherit someone. They just didn\u2019t do it. Maybe they verbally threatened her or tried to use money as a bribe. But ultimately they didn\u2019t actually disinherit her. It sounds like they weren\u2019t good people so verbal threats sound perfectly reasonable to them.    It doesn\u2019t mean anything legally. So she didn\u2019t steal anything. \n\nAs for the house. As is without an inspection? That was an expensive lesson they learned. This woman grew up in an abusive or otherwise crappy childhood situation. I\u2019m not thinking she took a leveler and checked the floors. And she moved out. What if the issues happened after she moved out? Her parents neglected their home the way they neglected their will I guess. She settled their estate by selling a home she didn\u2019t want. Even assuming she saw the floors weren\u2019t level, most people don\u2019t leap to the conclusion it was worthy of being condemned. Flooring can be uneven for different reasons you know. \n\nYou literally look at everything in her life with the most negative view possible. She is the mother of your husband\u2019s daughter. It\u2019s time to let this go. You\u2019ve got a lot of hate festering in you. The issue is your husband\u2019s parents being AHs to him. They haven\u2019t died and left him an estate and a house to sell so he\u2019s in a different position than his ex. Fight with them and leave her out of it.

I think you went way overboard with the court records.  So she was involved in litigation.  It would take me days to figure out what was going on, but apparently the judge agreed with your stepdaughter's mother.\n\nWhile I think they over-reacted (I would have just told you, I don't want to review all these documents), I can see why they were pissed.", "Okay first of all, shitty parents and in-laws.

A large inheritance really can set you up for success in all areas of life. It just sucks that it came at such a high cost to her.\u201d \n\nBc that\u2019s what this is- she got a very large inheritance and used it as the step up her parents intended it to be. \n\nOP, you are so very blind to what\u2019s going on here and how you\u2019ve let it take on this life of its own and you\u2019ve turned it into something so troublesome. Even if you believe what you\u2019re saying (you shouldn\u2019t) you need to be smart enough to play it cool! You just ran in and blew everything to smithereens in such a *stupid* way that you\u2019re the only one that got blowback from it. So incredibly stupid. \n\nIdk if you can save this. The first step for you is to start therapy and explore this with a professional. Jealousy is normal, and even understandable in this situation, but you\u2019ve let it get out of hand. You\u2019ve turned it into a conspiracy theory and you\u2019re the Qanon to this situation. \n\nGET IT TOGETHER, GIRL!!!", "YTA. It's okay to just dislike her. You can totally say, \"I can't stand her, no real reason for it.\" But you're grasping at straws to try and vilify this woman so everyone else will hate her too, and that's what reflects so poorly on you. Your fianc\u00e9's parents are comparing you and your fianc\u00e9 with her unfairly, that has to burn. The answer is not to rise to the bait of people who will try to pit people against each other.\nI would recommend you do some deep self reflection and ask yourself why you need her to be a villain so badly  rather than just ignoring her? Even if all you say is true, WHY are you spending so much time doing in-depth research into her life? It's not healthy to fixate on her like that.

Or officially voiding it (even if it was voided though they\u2019d have died intestate and as their daughter she\u2019s literally legally entitled to it). You also have such a misunderstanding of how probate works you really need to stop running your mouth. \n\nThe court records you say are proof she \u201cstole\u201d something are literally proof that she got what she was legally and morally entitled to. \n\nWhen buying a home it\u2019s so stupid to not bother with an inspection - while sellers often have one done, they have zero requirement to do so. The buyers could have insisted on one or even asked her to have one done at her expense (pretty standard in most sales nowadays unless it\u2019s a risky af, foreclosed, or fixer upper / tear down) - they could have and should\u2019ve done one themselves if\nNot. She sold it as is. They bought it as is. She didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\n\nPlus the home became uninhabitable only after the buyers started repairs which again not her fault.

And legally, it seems she was covered. \n\n\nTo be honest, it comes across that you resent the step-daughter's mother. You might not like her, but she had extenuating circumstances that gave her a better financial position in life than you, and that doesnt necessarily make her a bad person.

It's foolish as hell to buy without an inspection and some mortgage companies won't even work with you if you skip that step.", "Thats not a loophole. That's the literal will. If her parents failed to make proper arrangements that's not her stealing anything. Also, if you buy a house as is and there's no inspection, you risk the house being uninhabitable.

Unless she was asked specifically hey does the floor slant because floor issues are a dealbreaker for us and lied about it (and she has to have lied completely - a hedge-y non committal answer wouldn\u2019t likely be enough) - even knowledge of the problem isn\u2019t legally improper. \n\nBuying a home as is means that you cannot ask the seller to chip in a dang thing for repairs .
