I had placed an order for a grocery delivery and got things just for me. Specifically Oreos. My wife and I were out when the delivery came in and my boys had put everything away.\n\nWhen I asked where my Oreos were, they said they didn't see any. I assumed they didn't have them in stock. I checked and saw that they billed me for it. My wife said they probably forgot it and would buy me a package later. \n\nI went into my 11yo's room today to collect his laundry and looked under his bed and saw an empty Oreo package. I spoke to my wife and she said to drop it. I said I'm not dropping it. Those were my Oreos and he lied. \n\nI called him downstairs and asked him if he ate my Oreos. He looked at his mom and I said she's not bailing you out. He said he ate them with my 13yo son. I called his ass downstairs and he said he ate them too. \n\nMy wife jumped in and said no video games this weekend. Then my boys said \"you were the one who said we could have them!\" \n\nApparently they saw the Oreos and texted her if they could have some. She said SOME. They ate them all. But they said they both had some but not one of them ate them all! She didn't want to deal with it and said just don't tell your dad and she'll buy me a new package.\n\nI told my wife that she lied that the store forgot them so how is she going to punish our kids for lying? I said don't punish them unless you're going to be punish yourself. Be a grown ass woman and own your shit. This isn't about Oreos it's about lying. If you don't take a punishment then those boys are losing video until you do.\n\nSo now she's paying for the groceries this week out of her own money and my boys are still grounded this week.\n\nI made it wasn't about eating my Oreos but lying.", "created_utc": 1695784870, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16t9c3h/aita_for_telling_my_wife_not_to_bother_to_punish/", "score": 1321, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
