You should be angry at the lack of respect not just the idea that they stole your chance to have the first party there.", "NTA. They shouldn't throw a party at your house while you're gone without your permission. That's wrong on multiple levels. Housewarming party is meant to be for the person who BOUGHT the place, not the dogsitters who are vacationing there.", "NTA. It\u2019s your house, and your right to hold a housewarming party. In fact, I\u2019d wager this wasn\u2019t even a housewarming party but a thinly-veiled excuse to have fun. If they really cared about throwing you a housewarming party, they would at make sure you were there to celebrate this monumental occasion for YOU.", "NTA it wasn't a house warming party it was a party. They might be afraid the neighbors could tell you about it. If it were as house warming party ask where are the gifts?", "NTA. I thought I'd heard just about everything but a housewarming party without the homeowner is a new one to me. \n\nIt's a pretty big violation of trust if someone throws a party at your house without asking permission.", "NTA.

You are the owner, after all.", "NTA. They used your house for their own party and didn't ask you. If they didn't think they were doing anything wrong why wouldn't they ask you? NTA at all. They will probably say it's fine because you didn't know but that's not how friends treat each other.", "A goof? A party isn't a goof. And what doc they think a housewarming party is? It has to actually involve the homeowners and usually includes gifts. Your friends showing off to their friends then acting like it was for your benefit even though it was a secret is so insulting. These people suck. NTA.", "NTA. Why would anyone throw a 'housewarming party' at a house that isn't even theirs, particularly when the actual homeowners aren't there? That's the flimsiest excuse I've ever heard, & obviously a lie.

Havibg a \u201chousewarming party\u201d in the absence of the owners is unheard of. And keeping it a secret? That says it all right there.

I'd be mad too.", "I guess having a housewarming party means something different in today's time.

They hosted a housewarming party at your house without inviting you, nor told you.. Ouch.", "They suck, the people they invited suck and NTA. Using your house for a party is vile, and retro-calling it as being about celebrating YOUR house is pathetic. What if the dog got hurt??", "That\u2019s how I feel. Thank you for validating my feelings. They kinda made me feel like it shouldn\u2019t upset me.", "NTA\n\nNot a housewarming party if you weren't there. Not your friends. On top of that WHO else did they invite that is supposed to be your friend?\n\nStrangers? Other friends? All lied to you.", "NTA. In all the times I've been trusted to house/pet sit I have invited zero people without express permission of the homeowners. This includes my brother who tells me his house is my house and to do as I please. What if something had been damaged? Or gone missing? What if someone got hurt?", "NTA. So fucking disrespectful. They\u2019re not your friends.", "Let me get this straight.  They had a housewarming party at YOUR house without you.  That's not how it works.  So correction...they threw a party at your house while you were gone.  These are not your friends, these are AHs that took advantage of you and your house.  NTA and dump these \"friends\"", "It was not housewarming party, they used your house as a free venue. The fact that they are only telling you now is dammage control. Something showed up or they just remembered some detail that will eventually make you find out about the party anyway.

These people aren't your friends. Go find some new ones.", "NTA - if anyone threw any kind of party at my house while dog sitting they wouldd be dead to me.  Not to mention adding insult to injury and calling it a house warming party.", "And don\u2019t invite those idiots.", "Worse than that.

I'd be furious. Don't invite them when you have your OWN party.", "Wait, what?  You asked people to dog-sit and instead, they threw a party at your house without asking or telling you??  That's not cool by any definition.  And then when you did find out, they claimed it was a housewarming party??  What does that even mean?  You need to reconsider if these people are actually friends of yours.  And definitely make sure they don't have a key.", "It's not a housewarming of the owners are but there,  it's just sone people taking advantage of your place to host a party. \n\nStill if you couldn't tell,  then they did a good job with cleanup\n\nNTA", "NTA. I would be beyond mad if people I thought I could trust pulled a stunt like that. And my anxiety would not let me rest until I swept the house for cameras or recording devices (paranoid I know, but if they can break someone's trust as easily as that, I couldn't trust them, or the strangers they invited over, not to have been creepy)", "NTA. They did not throw a housewarming party - they just threw a party and used your house. It's insulting that they thought you would eat up this lie. Do yourself a favor and cut these \"friends\" from your life.", "NTA, how is it a housewarming party if you don't invite the homeowners? They used you, end of discussion.", "op=NTA\n\nFriend was housesitting, they don't get to throw parties(unless they have specific permission).  \nThey did not have permission\n\nthis friend(and OTHER friend--who I would guess got to attend) is NOT A friend and I'd make sure they don't ever have access again(ie change locks because a Key can be copied).

Housewarming parties typically involve housewarming GIFTS.", "I'm glad you included the guests! Because they obviously went, saw that OP wasn't there, and kept the secret from OP as well. They all suck", "The grill was dirty and the left half empty chip bags, veggie platter, and tequila. I figured they were just kind of messy not that they had a party! Benefit of the doubt I guess because we told them to have fun cooking and relaxing in the backyard.", "They didn\u2019t throw a housewarming party \n they threw a party and slapped \u201chouse warming\u201d on it so you wouldn\u2019t take them over the coals. \nNTA", "I think the fact that you feel like you needed us to validate you when you are obviously not the asshole here speaks volumes to how shitty your \"friends\" have been to you.", "NTA.  At least they didn't trash your place.  This was totally inappropriate - being asked to dog sit doesn't give anyone the right to throw a party.  You have every right to be pissed.\n\nI would never trust these friends with anything of value again.  No house or dog sitting, no baby sitting (when that time comes), can't borrow my car...\n\nThe fact that they tried to hide it from you tells me they knew what they did was wrong and did it anyways; and that would piss me off the most.", "NTA. So your \"friends\" threw a party, thy didn't invite you and tried making it a secret. Oh yeah, and you DIDN'T give them a permission to do so in YOUR OWN HOUSE. wow your friends suck", "Wow ! That was so wrong for a variety of reasons!! The first was that she shouldn\u2019t have had anyone in your house while dog sitting much less a party !

I\u2019d be pissed because strangers were in my home, and I knew nothing about it.  Time for new friends who can respect boundaries.", "So they had a housewarming party for you without you being present.  Sounds to me as if they had a party at your house and used a terrible excuse to justify it.  That violates way to many boundaries to count out side of counting them as ex-friends now.", "NTA...They threw a house warming party for you....that you weren't invited to?  That is the lamest excuse ever for someone throwing an unauthorized party and then trying to backpedal their way out of it.", "that was my reaction.  'congratulations on your new baby!  we had a baby shower, but didn't invite you!'  NTA", "Yeah, exactly.  X catches their spouse in bed with another man/woman.  \"It was a goof!\"", "It wasn't a housewarming party.  They had a party at a home that is not their own. They're saying it was a housewarming to try to make it okay.  \n\nIt is NOT okay.\n\nNTA", "Nta, but how is it a house warming if the owners aren't invited? That's crazy. Dump tem they're not your friends.", "There seems to be fairly widespread misunderstanding of what a housewarming party is. Housewarming parties are thrown by the homeowners, not by anyone else. It's one of the exceptions to the general social rule not to host a party for yourself where gifts are expected. That's because you're initiating your hosting in your new home. No one else can do that. The kind of sneaky thing you're doing at the same time is showing off your new property. So I've come across many people who think that the gift giving and the covert \"look at my shiny new thing\" needs 'social laundering' so to speak, by being hosted by someone other than the direct beneficiary. But the homeowners are compensating for that by providing entertainment and food. \n\nYou no more host a housewarming party in someone else's house than you would loan their artwork to a museum for a public viewing, or invite people to ride in their brand new car.\n\nSo NTA. These friends are untrustworthy users.", "Right?!", "That is just gaslighting. And it is not a housewarming when the owners aren\u2019t there. If my \u201cfriends\u201d had a party in my home without me being there we would not be friends. Things could have been broken and your house is new. I would not like people having a party when I cannot look out for my stuff. What if your new furniture got dirty? Or a rug or whatever\u2026 \n\nI think these are just AH \u201cfriends\u201d."]}
