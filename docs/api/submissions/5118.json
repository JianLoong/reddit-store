These are not your friends, these are people who know how to be nice to someone\u2019s face in order to take advantage.", "NTA, it's unacceptable to throw a party in someone's house without telling them. You should be angry at the lack of respect not just the idea that they stole your chance to have the first party there.", "NTA. They shouldn't throw a party at your house while you're gone without your permission. That's wrong on multiple levels. Housewarming party is meant to be for the person who BOUGHT the place, not the dogsitters who are vacationing there.", "NTA. It\u2019s your house, and your right to hold a housewarming party. In fact, I\u2019d wager this wasn\u2019t even a housewarming party but a thinly-veiled excuse to have fun. If they really cared about throwing you a housewarming party, they would at make sure you were there to celebrate this monumental occasion for YOU.", "NTA it wasn't a house warming party it was a party. They might be afraid the neighbors could tell you about it. If it were as house warming party ask where are the gifts?", "NTA. I thought I'd heard just about everything but a housewarming party without the homeowner is a new one to me. \n\nIt's a pretty big violation of trust if someone throws a party at your house without asking permission.", "NTA. They had no right to throw a party at your place, and their silence for two months screams, \u201cwe feel guilty.\u201d You should still throw a housewarming party anyway. You are the owner, after all.", "NTA. They used your house for their own party and didn't ask you. If they didn't think they were doing anything wrong why wouldn't they ask you? NTA at all. They will probably say it's fine because you didn't know but that's not how friends treat each other.", "A good? A party isn't a goof. And what doc they think a housewarming party is? It has to actually involve the homeowners and usually includes gifts. Your friends showing off to their friends then acting like it was for your benefit even though it was a secret is so insulting. These people suck. NTA.", "NTA. Why would anyone throw a 'housewarming party' at a house that isn't even theirs, particularly when the actual homeowners aren't there? That's the flimsiest excuse I've ever heard, & obviously a lie. So they threw a party at your house when they were supposed to be there just to watch your dog, didn't tell you about it, & now are trying to gloss over their disrespect because someone screwed up & accidentally let it slip what they'd done.", "NTA - they took advantage of you and your house", "NTA. Havibg a \u201chousewarming party\u201d in the absence of the owners is unheard of. And keeping it a secret? That says it all right there. They are gaslighting you if they make you feel like your offense is unwarranted.", "NTA\n\nHow does someone through a housewarming party without the actual homeowners present?\n\nSounds like they threw a party and used that as a excuse. I'd be mad too.", "I guess having a housewarming party means something different in today's time.  Because when we had a housewarming party the person throwing it is normally there and people bring gifts to help you celebrate.  So I'm a bit confused.  \n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Using your house for a party is vile, and retro-calling it as being about celebrating YOUR house is pathetic. What if the dog got hurt??", "That\u2019s how I feel.
