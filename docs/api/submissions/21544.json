I was really happy and appreciative.  He knew all of this.  \n\nWell we got home pretty late. Like around the time our baby and toddler were suppose to be going to bed. So while we were driving, me and my bf agreed to get the kids in bed and do our thing. (He wanted to sleep. And I wanted to drink a beer and watch a few episodes of a show) \n\nWhen we got home. I noticed all the bottles were dirty.  Which annoyed me because I hate washing bottles. (Yes he knows this) and again. It was already really late. So it was just more to do when I wanted to relax. \n\nMy bf told me as I was getting ready to pick up the first bottle, that we had to clean up before we went to bed.  I\u2019m still a bit annoyed at the situation with the bottles because I wish I would of known all of them needed washing before we left.  So yes. I had a bit of frustration in my voice.  So I responded with \u201cI know. I\u2019m about to wash the bottles now. I hate washing them so late\u201d I then asked if we could hurry and get all the cleaning that needed to be done out the way so we could get relax.  \n\nHe proceeded to sit on his phone and ply his game.  His games last 10-15 mins.  And by then I could of gotten everything done. I eventually got annoyed at him because he was refusing to get up and just help me like we said we\u2019d do in the car. \u201cGive me a second\u201d \u201cwhy won\u2019t you let me play just one game\u201d so I just started grabbing trash in frustration,  which got his attention and he started following me around asking me \u201cwhy I\u2019m being like\u201d \u201cwhy are you so upset.  I said I\u2019d do it. Just let me finish this one game\u201d \n\nOne thing led to another and he basically called me selfish for not letting him enjoy one game after he \u201cdid all this\u201d for me after a hard day of work.

Boyfriend could\u2019ve waited on the game and played once chores were done and you both could relax. I especially understand your frustration given it was your birthday. Paying him back was sort of petty, but I don\u2019t think it makes you TA.", "NTA. There was no reason that he had to play that game right then. He knew that there was cleaning that needed to be done, I think he figured that if he ignored it long enough you\u2019d take care of it all.", "That male strategy of \u2018I\u2019ll just waste time doing this random thing while you finish up that work to be done\u2019 is ages old and still awful. If I could murder every idiot who ever used it, the world would be a better place.", "NTA and honestly it\u2019s a bummer you share kids cause he doesn\u2019t sound worth your time and effort", "NTA.\n\n(The scenario that it\u2019s your birthday). \nNTA. He should have realized it was your birthday and said \u201cI\u2019ll clean up, go relax.\u201d And vice versa for his birthday. \n\n(The scenario that it is a normal day). \nStill NTA. When you are trying to clean up for the night, your partner should be helping. You couldn\u2019t go watch your show before cleaning, so why does he get to play his game before cleaning? It\u2019s a team effort for a reason, a partnership. He\u2019s the big AH. I\u2019m sure the amount of time it took to play his game was the same time it took to just tidy things up, then he could\u2019ve went and relaxed and played his game without worry about a dirty house. \n\nHe also is the AH for making it a big deal that he took you out on your birthday. You already said you appreciated it, yet he still hangs it over your head. Like, \u201cI did something nice for you, you owe me.\u201d  Similar to the, \u201cI didn\u2019t do thing because I *wanted* to, I did it out of obligation\u201d, and those are two VERY different things. It is a very childish thing to hang something like that over someone else\u2019s, especially your partner, head.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Next time, if there is one, phones get locked in a drawer until chores are done.
