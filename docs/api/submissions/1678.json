She's taught them to clean or help clean their rooms, assist with food prep and keep their spaces organized.

I was there, so were our parents, her husband's parents and his sister. The husband's sister, Ashleigh, made a comment asking if she's going to calm down a bit now that she'll have three kids. My sister asked what she meant. Ashleigh said that my sister was really \"over the top\" with the kids and wouldn't be able to maintain it with three.\n\nMy sister said she would never slack on her parenting duties. Ashleigh said she only saw it that way because of how we were raised, but that \"isn't how things are done in America.\" I asked her how things are done in America, because my sister and I are Americans and were both born here.

I wish your sister, or maybe one of your parents, could have just smiled at this idiot sister-in-law and said, well, I guess we will see. Any other answer unfortunately made you and your sister look like you were going on the defensive.. There's no way to deal with people like this. The clueless sister-in-law will never get it.

My dad was 8th generation American and strict as all hell.", "NTA\n\nGood job on standing up for your sister! Everything she is doing is pretty much what I see and hear other parents doing. A music, a sport and keeping their rooms tidy. \n\nJust out of curiosity: Where is your BIL in all of this? Did he also stand up for his wife? Hope he shut that nonsense down also!", "Maybe Ashleigh sees your sis as a \"tiger mom\" or something. But even so its absolutely none of her business as to  how your sis raises her kids.
