Others can charge it up to sexual assault since it involves breasts, so she got really lucky you were actually okay with that part, if not the destruction of your property and child endangerment part.\n\nYour sister majorly crossed some boundaries that, in many respects, could be considered criminal. If this was the first time she did anything that disrespected your boundaries, I would say calling the police was an overreaction, but it seems that she has been very vocal about things that are none of her concern and this was just her escalating her behavior, which was already over the line. Plus, she's messing with your infant *and* your ability to care for him while you are vulnerable, in the hospital, and depending on her support, all of which she leveraged to violate your boundaries.

I'm sure there are texts/social media posts to establish motive, if not outright guilt, and unlike criminal cases, I'm pretty sure that silence can count against you for civil cases. So if she didn't go out of her way to clear her name or refute OP's claims when OP called the police, the judge can make inferences based on that. She can't just show up to court and suddenly say what formula, especially if it could've negatively affected her job, it's reasonable to say a reasonable person would take steps to correct the falsehood prior to the court date, especially if OP was getting the police involved. \n\nAll that to say, this sounds like exactly the type of thing small claims court exists to address, and the proof OP would have to collect shouldn't be too strenuous, if it's just small claims. I'm not a lawyer and I've never personally taken anything to small claims but to me this seems a lot less bleak than you're painting it, and I can't tell if I'm being overly optimistic or if you're being overly nihilistic, or if it's somewhere in between. \n\nThe big issue with small claims, at least from what I've heard, isn't that it's hard to win, it's more that winning doesn't mean much, because you have to collect the damages yourself. She could win, and if her sister just decides she isn't going to pay, it gets expensive and not worth it to enforce. Although again, if she has a government job that her family was worried about, that might make a difference. I'll tentatively jump on the nihilism train for that part, but not the winning the case part.\n\nETA: the filing fee may be 2 containers of formula, but if she wins it would be a net of 12. I'm not a betting person, but I like those odds. Especially if the state OP lives in has filing fee waivers, cuz again I may just be naive but this situation sounds like exactly what those were put in place to help with. Idk, this just seems super textbook to me, maybe I've just been listening to too many true crime podcasts lately though.", ">  She threw it out. \n\nDestruction of property.\n\nHowever, in this case, she removed it from the premises, which turns it into theft followed by disposal of stolen property.", "But that's nothing compared to the killer sheep!
