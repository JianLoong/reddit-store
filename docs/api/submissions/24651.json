Others can charge it up to sexual assault since it involves breasts, so she got really lucky you were actually okay with that part, if not the destruction of your property and child endangerment part.\n\nYour sister majorly crossed some boundaries that, in many respects, could be considered criminal. If this was the first time she did anything that disrespected your boundaries, I would say calling the police was an overreaction, but it seems that she has been very vocal about things that are none of her concern and this was just her escalating her behavior, which was already over the line.
