{"id": 24870, "submission_id": "15tunzr", "title": "AITA for stopping my cousin\u2019s marriage proposal?", "selftext": "I(27 female) just got married to the love of my life \u201cJacob\u201d(30 male) this past weekend. \nMy cousin \u201cPatrick\u201d(34 male) has always been immature, selfish, and rudely forthright.  For as long as I can remember, he has never failed to make birthday parties(not his own), holidays, and other occasions all about him. \nThe adults in the family have always shown him favoritism, and this has overtime spoiled and enabled him. \nA week before the wedding, he called to let me know that he was going to propose to his long time girlfriend during the reception. This infuriated me, but I calmly asked him to not go through with it. When he asked why, I said that I did not want attention to be deviated away from me and my husband on our special day. This did not go over well, and soon after he began yelling at me. He even went as far as calling me a selfish b*** and then hung up on me. \nLater that day, I received multiple angry phone calls from our parents, saying that I was being selfish and unreasonable. \nI explained to them that at the end of the day, it was MY wedding day, and that it was my decision if I wanted the proposal to take place. This angered many, with some family members going as far as deciding not to attend.  \nI assumed that Patrick was also going to make a no show. But to my surprise, he texted me saying that he\u2019d show up anyway. \nI knew that he was going to go against my wishes and carry on with the proposal.\nSo, I concocted a plan and showed a picture of Patrick to the live band that I hired for the reception. I even payed them extra, with the request to start playing should Patrick ever try to make a speech. \nThe day was finally here and Patrick arrived with his girlfriend and his parents. He was acting very cordial for once, but I was not fooled. After the maid of honor and best man speeches, I noticed Patrick getting up from his seat and making his way toward the stage. \nAnd just like that, the band started to play. I smiled, grabbed my husband, and rushed towards the dance floor. Everyone else joined in, and it looked as though Patrick\u2019s actions went unnoticed. He made three more attempts, which were shut down immediately with loud music. Some of the cousins even blocked his path, telling him to \u201cjust cut it out.\u201d He looked more and more angry as the night progressed, and eventually grabbed his girlfriend\u2019s hand and stormed out of the venue. \nAs I watched him leave, I laughed out loud, and had a blast for the rest of the night with family and friends. I woke up the next morning to more angry text messages and voicemails, which I ignored. I decided to not engage in the drama, and just enjoyed my honeymoon with my husband.  So am I the asshole?\n\n\u2026 \n\nWOW! I am positively overwhelmed with all of the kind responses! \ud83d\udc96Thank you so much to everyone who took the time to write a nice message. I\u2019m trying to read every single one, but there\u2019s an overwhelming amount coming in right now, so I apologize if I can\u2019t answer every single question, but I will answer the most frequently asked ones.\n\n1. I have decided to go no contact with Patrick and a few of the opposing family members. \n\n2. He announced that he will be hosting an engagement party for his girlfriend. But that I am strictly uninvited to both the party and the wedding. I heard this secondhand from my parents.\n\n3. Speaking of my parents, they were at first unsupportive of my decision with Patrick\u2019s proposal, but after seeing his behavior, decided to support me, and overall agreed with my decision.\n\n4. Many asked why Patrick wasn\u2019t uninvited. I was planning on doing that at first. But after considerable thought, decided against it. Knowing my cousin, he would\u2019ve made an even bigger scene and would\u2019ve done something even more drastic, since that\u2019s what he does when people go up against him. He\u2019s a grown man that still throws tantrums, so I wanted to de-escalate the situation and cause minimal drama as possible. And the moment I thought up my plan, I was too excited to not execute it. \n\n5. Many are asking why our family would overall excuse his behavior for so long. Well, it\u2019s unfortunately learned behavior since, that side of the family is filled with a plethora of unsavory characters. I\u2019m assuming that Patrick reminds a lot of the elders of themselves, which I wouldn\u2019t be surprised by. And I do think that explains why he\u2019s always been favored. He also excelled in every school subject, got the best grades and is now a very aggressive, very well paid criminal defense lawyer. That side of our family values education and wealth above all else, so they\u2019ve always excused his poor behavior.\n\n6. Yes, the band was handsomely paid and tipped well. They are my husband\u2019s friends and we are also planning on treating them to dinner next week as an extra thank you.\n\nI hope this answered your questions.

Family dynamics develop to the point where everyone appeases the asshole, so when someone points out the asshole's bad behavior, that person is the one seen as \"starting trouble.\"\n\nIt's the golden child/scapegoat dichotomy. You go your whole life trying to doing things right and being the golden child. You follow the rules, keep people happy, fix any little mistakes you make, and enjoy a pretty drama-free life. People like you! But when you start to notice other people's poor behavior (especially poor behavior that affects the health and safety of your children), everyone's true colors show. It turns out you're not the golden child--the golden child is the one who constantly fucks up and get their ass covered for them. The one everyone is afraid of upsetting, the one who gets the benefit of every doubt, the one who takes shelter under any kind of excuse that even other people have made up for them.\n\nYou, however, get no leeway because you have proven yourself competent and resilient--meaning that people should be allowed to treat you poorly with impunity. That's just the way they are, and we're all a lot happier when they are happy. We know you won't get mad like that, o former golden child, so it's okay for you to be treated unfairly. Be the bigger person and take the punches so this can all go away. If you don't, you are the one really creating the problem--the scapegoat.\n\nDon't be an asshole by holding others to the standards you to which you held yourself, the same standards to which you thought others were holding you.

It's like, a fundamental cardinal rule you don't propose or announce a pregnancy during someone else's wedding, that's just very basic accepted social etiquette! It's very weird and strange he wants SO BADLY to propose during your wedding, he cares more about sabotoging your wedding than making the proposal a special experience. I feel sorry for his girlfriend. Who would want their proposal to be at an event celebrating someone else? How can your parents say YOU are the one being selfish and unreasonable? The fact that he ignored your request and repeatedly attempted to get on the stage to propose, then was ANGRY he couldn't ruin your wedding is diabolical.

She's all like, \"Yo, Patrick, don't propose at the reception, okay?\" I mean, I'm just trying to share the joy, but she flips.

I've played the \"favorite\" card before. But for real, it's my life too, right? So, I texted her saying I'll still show up. I had a feeling she'd try to rain on my parade, so I rolled up all polite and stuff. Thing is, I knew she was cooking something up.  \nDuring the speeches, I decide it's my moment. I get up, walk toward the stage, and what do I hear? The live band starting to play! Can you believe that? But hey, I'm not one to back down. So, I try a few more times, and every time, the band jumps in. I ain't no quitter, but her plan was bulletproof.  \nThe night went on, and the vibe stayed lit. She's having a ball, and yeah, I got some cousins blocking my moves. I mean, they're just trying to keep the peace, right? Eventually, my girl and I bounced. We're not gonna stick around for all that chaos. But let me tell you, I was pretty damn annoyed.  \nMorning after, guess what? More texts and voicemails. Like, come on, give it a rest, right? I decided not to get caught up in the drama. I mean, they enjoyed their honeymoon, and I enjoyed my own kind of escape.
