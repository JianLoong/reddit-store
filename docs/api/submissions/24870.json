For as long as I can remember, he has never failed to make birthday parties(not his own), holidays, and other occasions all about him. \nThe adults in the family have always shown him favoritism, and this has overtime spoiled and enabled him. \nA week before the wedding, he called to let me know that he was going to propose to his long time girlfriend during the reception. This infuriated me, but I calmly asked him to not go through with it. When he asked why, I said that I did not want attention to be deviated away from me and my husband on our special day. This did not go over well, and soon after he began yelling at me. He even went as far as calling me a selfish b*** and then hung up on me. \nLater that day, I received multiple angry phone calls from our parents, saying that I was being selfish and unreasonable. \nI explained to them that at the end of the day, it was MY wedding day, and that it was my decision if I wanted the proposal to take place. This angered many, with some family members going as far as deciding not to attend.  \nI assumed that Patrick was also going to make a no show. But to my surprise, he texted me saying that he\u2019d show up anyway. \nI knew that he was going to go against my wishes and carry on with the proposal.\nSo, I concocted a plan and showed a picture of Patrick to the live band that I hired for the reception. I even payed them extra, with the request to start playing should Patrick ever try to make a speech. \nThe day was finally here and Patrick arrived with his girlfriend and his parents. He was acting very cordial for once, but I was not fooled. After the maid of honor and best man speeches, I noticed Patrick getting up from his seat and making his way toward the stage. \nAnd just like that, the band started to play. I smiled, grabbed my husband, and rushed towards the dance floor. Everyone else joined in, and it looked as though Patrick\u2019s actions went unnoticed. He made three more attempts, which were shut down immediately with loud music. Some of the cousins even blocked his path, telling him to \u201cjust cut it out.\u201d He looked more and more angry as the night progressed, and eventually grabbed his girlfriend\u2019s hand and stormed out of the venue. \nAs I watched him leave, I laughed out loud, and had a blast for the rest of the night with family and friends. I woke up the next morning to more angry text messages and voicemails, which I ignored. I decided to not engage in the drama, and just enjoyed my honeymoon with my husband.

It's bad enough that he wanted to propose at your event, but incredibly rude that he yelled at you and called you a b\\* a week before your wedding (you should have uninvited him for that), and then he tried to do it anyway?!  What an AH he is.  I wouldn't go to his wedding, and I'd pity whoever he marries.", "Amazing move but I seriously don't think there is any doubt in your mind about you being an AH or not.

Brilliant..\n\nAnd it is also nice to see selfish entitled people get their comeuppance.", "NTA.

Family dynamics develop to the point where everyone appeases the asshole, so when someone points out the asshole's bad behavior, that person is the one seen as \"starting trouble.\"\n\nIt's the golden child/scapegoat dichotomy. You go your whole life trying to doing things right and being the golden child. You follow the rules, keep people happy, fix any little mistakes you make, and enjoy a pretty drama-free life. People like you! But when you start to notice other people's poor behavior (especially poor behavior that affects the health and safety of your children), everyone's true colors show. It turns out you're not the golden child--the golden child is the one who constantly fucks up and get their ass covered for them. The one everyone is afraid of upsetting, the one who gets the benefit of every doubt, the one who takes shelter under any kind of excuse that even other people have made up for them.\n\nYou, however, get no leeway because you have proven yourself competent and resilient--meaning that people should be allowed to treat you poorly with impunity. That's just the way they are, and we're all a lot happier when they are happy. We know you won't get mad like that, o former golden child, so it's okay for you to be treated unfairly. Be the bigger person and take the punches so this can all go away. If you don't, you are the one really creating the problem--the scapegoat.\n\nDon't be an asshole by holding others to the standards you to which you held yourself, the same standards to which you thought others were holding you.

She didn't draw extra attention to it, she didn't outright shame him, she barely interacted with him at all! She just got to dance to live music at her wedding without letting someone ruin it. Childish? This is classy as hell \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I would love it if the band had burst into Aretha's \"R-E-S-P-E-C-T\". The irony alone would have been magical! \n\n\nThen again, they also could have played \"Stop\" by the Spice Girls, or the disco classic \"Give It Up\", or even a slow Elvis version of \"Don't\" ! Just to really upset the poor Golden child. \n\n\nI gotta say I LOVE the dignity, grace and creativity you've shown OP. I hope you have a happy marriage and at least one professional photo of the pouty exit so you can laugh about this for years to come!", "Oh yeah I would\u2019ve even worry about inviting him to things in the future since we\u2019ve both decided to go no contact.", "He\u2019s in the middle amongst our cousins, but the youngest of his siblings. He\u2019s always been very good at school, excelling in every subject. He\u2019s also a very aggressive, well payed criminal defense lawyer(but such a cheap stake). Because of this, he\u2019s always been praised and beloved. He also has much of the same qualities as the elders, I\u2019m pretty sure they see a lot of themselves in him. They are very old-school, and they value wealth above all else. Luckily my parents aren\u2019t this bad. But a lot of my aunts and uncles are. So I think overall that\u2019s why.", "Thank you so much! \ud83d\ude0a", "Same! And that can\u2019t have been easy to be on the look out for the guy every second.", "I did just one of the attempts! \ud83e\udd23 even the videographer was laughing!", "It was hard not to burst out laughing! His face was the cherry on top! \ud83e\udd23", "Thank you!!!", "Oh, forgot during reading. Well then he deserved it even more!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhh I literally can imagine his brain being like \u201cok so- what? AGAIN???\ud83e\udd2c\u201d \n\nAhhhhh so good \ud83d\ude02", "That was a great way to play this situation.  Very creative. I have to admit that if I were in your shoes that I would have called up his GF and told her that cousin was going to propose.  (An A-H move on my part I know).  You, on the other hand are NTA", "The award is because while he\u2019s a scummy criminal defense lawyer, you are the reigning GODDESSBADGUY!!!! \nBrava!!!!!  \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd23", "Now just remember to announce your pregnancy at their engagement party \ud83d\ude09", "I know it's not how it happened but in my head they played [this thing](https://youtu.be/OihbIgXBsMU) every time he got up", "Sooooooooooooooooo yeah, we NEED to see that :)", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 this has been suggested multiple times! I would totally take up on it but unfortunately I\u2019m note even invited."]}
