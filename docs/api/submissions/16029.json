You don't have a baby yet, so you just don't get it yet. The floor is convenient, it's safer than an elevated surface, it's easy to clean if a hard surface. It's not like they used your bed or couch. And really, *where* in the bathroom would you expect them to change the diaper?! On your counter near your toothbrush? Would you want your baby on the floor near a person's toilet?! Gross!\n\nMost parents would move to a more private place to change vs. near the group. It would have been polite to ask the host, but the bathroom is not exactly a convenient idea either.\n\nYour friends have changed a million diapers by now, so an event like this was just a total no-brainer to them. They forget that not everyone is comfortable with babies and diapers. So probably didn't do this to be rude, just weren't thinking.", "NAH Is your bathroom floor tile? Is it small? Pretty normal to use a  softer floor where there\u2019s space to change a diaper. So I can see how it didn\u2019t even occur you\u2019d have a problem.

If im at friends, i ask where a good place would be to change my 5 month old.... i would never just change her in front of anyone because \n\n1. I dont want anyone to see my babys private parts. \n2. It's disrespectful to just up and change her anywhere in someones house without asking\n3. You never know all the time what kind of diaper change it'll be until you start because sometimes babies like to pee or poop while changing and it could make a mess.", "NTA, though I wouldn\u2019t want to change a diaper on the bathroom counter. Countertops and 8 month-olds aren\u2019t a great combination. Still, your friends should have asked if they could use another room (bedroom?) to change their kid\u2019s diaper.

You have the baby at someone else's house and have to diaper change  Then you'll see, what is acceptable to a non parent quickly becomes unacceptable to a parent.\n\nAlso, you guys sound like a shit group of friends. A couple had a baby 8 months ago and you dropped them when they couldn't come because, I dunno, they just had a new human to take care of so time for d & d might be low on their list.  But I bet if you called and tried to actively include them they would have loved to join. It's probably taken 8 months to get it together on a night they had no say in.

Sure she should use the bathroom but she probably thought she was with friends.

Good luck out there.", "INFO: \n\nYou haven't been around a lot of babies, have you? \n\nWas she using a changing pad under the baby, or was the child directly on the floor? \n\nYou might not know this yet, but most diaper bags come equipped with a changing pad. It basically turns any surface into a changing area. \n\nThe floor is also the safest place to change the baby in an unchildproofed home. \n\n8 months is a squirm, wiggle, and grab age. Placing the baby on an unprepared elevated surface is a recipe for disaster. And even knowing the house, she would not expect you to be prepared, I'm guessing you haven't announced the pregnancy yet? \n\nBabies roll, even when you are holding them. An unbalanced wiggle while you are one handing a baby and a diaper bag can result in a fall, and from countertop height, you are looking at an ER visit. \n\nThe bathroom floor would not be my choice either. Have you ever cleaned a bathroom floor? Would you really want to put your baby on a bathroom floor? Even on a changing pad they can reach the floor with their hands. Even one cleaned for company? Do you have any idea how many dangerous things are in a bathroom? Again even with one arm on the kid, you have to repack the diaper bag. \n\nThe floor in an open but semi private area is the best bet. \nBeds are a bad idea too. \n\nIf she wasn't using a changing pad, then that's a slightly different manner. \n\nAs far as the RSPV goes... \n\nAnd they lived in the same apartment complex, and you haven't seen them for how long? But you know they moved. Have you seen them at all outside D&D? \n\nBecause yes, it was kinda rude to just show up like that. Are you absolutely sure that nobody invited them? Even the non-players? \n\nWas there ever an RSVP text required? In the group chat about dinner? \n\nHow long have they been out of contact? \n\n\nCongratulations on the pregnancy!!!", "i agree with u/Maximum-Ear1745. nta. they should not have brought the baby and certainly not unexpectedly. having said that, i'll offer you some food for thought. if you want them to do it in the bathroom at least make sure it's properly equipped. i don't have any surface in a bathroom that's big enough to lay a baby on and change its diaper. otherwise the only remaining options would be a piece of furniture or the table.", "8mth olds roll and wiggle. A bathroom counter is not a safe place to do this, they\u2019ll probably roll off, even if it\u2019s a sizable area. The floor is safer.   \nBut the floor right next to the gaming table? Nah. On the sofa on an old towel is safer/better. Or an old towel on the lounge room floor if it\u2019s a blow out.   \nBut.. bonus! You are about to have a baby! Why not set up a changing table somewhere?   \n\n\nNTA, just clueless.", "Where in your bathroom do you want her to change the baby? Do you have a fold out changing table in there or something?

They're crawling at roughly 60mph, and it's your job to snag a heel and flip them over. You do not calf rope them - though it will be tempting - you just engage like an Indy 500 pit crew. Baby will be laughing their ass off once caught, but do not get distracted. They'll just escape if you show weakness, and at this point, you're officially too old for this shit.

They came over unannounced and unexpected, not giving you the option to make a space or even talk to them about your preference first. Plus, it's an AH move to just change your baby's diaper in someone else's home without asking if it's ok to change them in that specific spot first. And they're in a room with a group of other people! I'm a parent and if I went to a friend's house expecting an adults only engagement, I wouldn't appreciate the baby's diaper being changed where we were all hanging out. People are saying not to change a baby on the floor of the bathroom, but this is why they made portable changing pads; I changed my son's diaper using ours in bathrooms at parties, solely because most of the other guests don't want to have to be put in this type of situation.", "YTA mildly.

Then when your buds come over with the baby, you can let them know there\u2019s a convenient bathroom diaper changing spot. If I visit a home with a changing table, the host will let me know where it is, and I\u2019m happy to use it. Otherwise, we\u2019re probably using the floor, or the furniture. \n\n*If you get a baby bathtub, you can put it on that bathroom counter (obviously you\u2019d take the changing pad off first), and it\u2019s the perfect height for bathing baby. Putting it in the regular bathtub (or in a shower) is not great for your back.", "Bathrooms are usually smaller and probably have piss on the floor.

Now if she changed baby on your sofa, that\u2019s a different story.", "I have a 2 year old and I don\u2019t think you are the asshole, specifically because while I agree changing the baby in the bathroom might be weird, even on the counter (because they are hard), when I\u2019m somewhere with my daughter and she needs a change, I have a diaper pad that I lay underneath her to protect her and the surface, and that\u2019s pretty common with parents, or so I\u2019ve seen. \nI also always ask \u201cHey where is a good spot for me to change her?\u201d and respectfully discuss it with whoever is the host. \n\nEither way I don\u2019t necessarily think the bathroom is the best idea, even on the counter (because hard and babies heads are very soft and fragile) but I think you are NTA because they showed up without notice, with the baby, to a home that isn\u2019t prepped for a baby, and didn\u2019t clarify anything etiquette-wise with you. \n\nAnd for all of you saying that they weren\u2019t thinking about it because it\u2019s routine for them, they\u2019ve been doing it for 8 months. I\u2019ve been doing it for almost 3 years, and my mom has been doing it for 15 years with 3 separate kids (not even counting me) and we both *always* ask before we change our kids at someone else\u2019s house. It\u2019s just polite! That\u2019s their space.

Aside from the most extreme worse case scenario, you should ask if it\u2019s ok to change a child in the middle of the floor, in the midst of a group event. My sisters both have kids. The bathroom isn\u2019t suited for them to change diapers so I make sure the bedroom is set up for them. They can use the bed or a waist high table. It gives them privacy, they are near the bathroom to get towels for blow outs, and keeps the smell away from everyone and the food.", "I\u2019m confused?

The floor is a safer surface to change a baby and if you\u2019re using a changing mat that protects your baby from a dirty floor it shouldn\u2019t matter too much which room is used but do it away from the guests. If it was a public space then the floor isn\u2019t an option like a public bathroom but this is a private space and should be much cleaner no matter the room. Also it was rude to just turn up without asking if it\u2019s okay to bring the baby. They can be pretty distracting when trying to play such a game.

I have seen parents visiting do this dozens of times in unfamiliar environments, checking with people is pretty common courtesy, and that is what most people do.

The entitlement is the showing up with a child, not so much the changing of the diaper.\n\nI personally would never have done this with my kids, but the diaper change is the least problematic thing these parents did, IMO. Having people show up unannounced for a D&D where there is not place thought out for them in the session and having 2 extra people for dinner you weren't counting on, is much more frustrating than having them change a quick pee diaper on the floor.\nIf they had done those 2 things without the kid present, it would be nearly equally problematic and entitled.", "At the end of the day, his house, his rules.
