You don't have a baby yet, so you just don't get it yet. The floor is convenient, it's safer than an elevated surface, it's easy to clean if a hard surface. It's not like they used your bed or couch. And really, *where* in the bathroom would you expect them to change the diaper?! On your counter near your toothbrush? Would you want your baby on the floor near a person's toilet?! Gross!\n\nMost parents would move to a more private place to change vs. near the group. It would have been polite to ask the host, but the bathroom is not exactly a convenient idea either.\n\nYour friends have changed a million diapers by now, so an event like this was just a total no-brainer to them. They forget that not everyone is comfortable with babies and diapers. So probably didn't do this to be rude, just weren't thinking.", "NAH Is your bathroom floor tile? Is it small? Pretty normal to use a  softer floor where there\u2019s space to change a diaper. So I can see how it didn\u2019t even occur you\u2019d have a problem. I\u2019ve never used a bathroom floor unless it had a changing table. If you have kids one day you\u2019ll understand. \n\nNow showing up with an RSVP was not cool.", "NTA-they show up unannounced, and then brought their child, then didnt even ask where would be an appropriate place to change them...even me, a new parent. If im at friends, i ask where a good place would be to change my 5 month old.... i would never just change her in front of anyone because \n\n1. I dont want anyone to see my babys private parts. \n2. It's disrespectful to just up and change her anywhere in someones house without asking\n3. You never know all the time what kind of diaper change it'll be until you start because sometimes babies like to pee or poop while changing and it could make a mess.", "NTA, though I wouldn\u2019t want to change a diaper on the bathroom counter. Countertops and 8 month-olds aren\u2019t a great combination. Still, your friends should have asked if they could use another room (bedroom?) to change their kid\u2019s diaper. Common courtesy. \n\nIt\u2019s also common courtesy, esp. if dinner is being served, to let the hosts know if you\u2019re going to show up.", "NTA. Of course it would depend how you ask, but as the host I think it\u2019s more than reasonable to request a baby is changed elsewhere and not in the floor in a group setting.\n\nCara and Peter are total AHs for showing up with no notice, and especially bringing a child to a group event with no notice.", "NTA but I'm curious to see if your view on this changes after your kiddo is born. And congrats on that!!", "Not only would you be the asshole in this situation but in a year you will be in this situation reversed.  You have the baby at someone else's house and have to diaper change  Then you'll see, what is acceptable to a non parent quickly becomes unacceptable to a parent.\n\nAlso, you guys sound like a shit group of friends. A couple had a baby 8 months ago and you dropped them when they couldn't come because, I dunno, they just had a new human to take care of so time for d & d might be low on their list.  But I bet if you called and tried to actively include them they would have loved to join. It's probably taken 8 months to get it together on a night they had no say in. As you will learn, having a baby changes your availability.", "YWBTA\n\nIt\u2019s not just about having enough space (though, assuming those countertops have sinks, it might not be enough flat space)\n\nIt\u2019s also about the kid not falling off of a high surface.\n\nIt\u2019s also about wanting to be around friends and to hear what\u2019s going on in the campaign.\n\nIt\u2019s also about encouraging your friend to be part of the campaign again, and not making her feel like an outcast or burden because of the baby.

Sure she should use the bathroom but she probably thought she was with friends.

Good luck out there.", "INFO: \n\nYou haven't been around a lot of babies, have you? \n\nWas she using a changing pad under the baby, or was the child directly on the floor? \n\nYou might not know this yet, but most diaper bags come equipped with a changing pad. It basically turns any surface into a changing area. \n\nThe floor is also the safest place to change the baby in an unchildproofed home. \n\n8 months is a squirm, wiggle, and grab age. Placing the baby on an unprepared elevated surface is a recipe for disaster. And even knowing the house, she would not expect you to be prepared, I'm guessing you haven't announced the pregnancy yet? \n\nBabies roll, even when you are holding them. An unbalanced wiggle while you are one handing a baby and a diaper bag can result in a fall, and from countertop height, you are looking at an ER visit. \n\nThe bathroom floor would not be my choice either. Have you ever cleaned a bathroom floor? Would you really want to put your baby on a bathroom floor? Even on a changing pad they can reach the floor with their hands. Even one cleaned for company? Do you have any idea how many dangerous things are in a bathroom? Again even with one arm on the kid, you have to repack the diaper bag. \n\nThe floor in an open but semi private area is the best bet. \nBeds are a bad idea too. \n\nIf she wasn't using a changing pad, then that's a slightly different manner. \n\nAs far as the RSPV goes... \n\nAnd they lived in the same apartment complex, and you haven't seen them for how long? But you know they moved. Have you seen them at all outside D&D? \n\nBecause yes, it was kinda rude to just show up like that. Are you absolutely sure that nobody invited them? Even the non-players? \n\nWas there ever an RSVP text required? In the group chat about dinner? \n\nHow long have they been out of contact? \n\n\nCongratulations on the pregnancy!!!", "i agree with u/Maximum-Ear1745. nta. they should not have brought the baby and certainly not unexpectedly. having said that, i'll offer you some food for thought. if you want them to do it in the bathroom at least make sure it's properly equipped. i don't have any surface in a bathroom that's big enough to lay a baby on and change its diaper. otherwise the only remaining options would be a piece of furniture or the table.", "8mth olds roll and wiggle. A bathroom counter is not a safe place to do this, they\u2019ll probably roll off, even if it\u2019s a sizable area. The floor is safer.   \nBut the floor right next to the gaming table? Nah. On the sofa on an old towel is safer/better. Or an old towel on the lounge room floor if it\u2019s a blow out.   \nBut.. bonus! You are about to have a baby! Why not set up a changing table somewhere?   \n\n\nNTA, just clueless.", "Where in your bathroom do you want her to change the baby? Do you have a fold out changing table in there or something?

They're crawling at roughly 60mph, and it's your job to snag a heel and flip them over. You do not calf rope them - though it will be tempting - you just engage like an Indy 500 pit crew. Baby will be laughing their ass off once caught, but do not get distracted. They'll just escape if you show weakness, and at this point, you're officially too old for this shit. Slap those tapes/velcro/pins, secure any tiny clothing, and only then do you release the child back into the wild. \n\nTidy up and return to your regularly scheduled programming.

They came over unannounced and unexpected, not giving you the option to make a space or even talk to them about your preference first. Plus, it's an AH move to just change your baby's diaper in someone else's home without asking if it's ok to change them in that specific spot first. And they're in a room with a group of other people! I'm a parent and if I went to a friend's house expecting an adults only engagement, I wouldn't appreciate the baby's diaper being changed where we were all hanging out. People are saying not to change a baby on the floor of the bathroom, but this is why they made portable changing pads; I changed my son's diaper using ours in bathrooms at parties, solely because most of the other guests don't want to have to be put in this type of situation.", "YTA mildly.

Y\u2019all are expecting, so go ahead and pop a changing pad on that big ol\u2019 bathroom counter when you\u2019re ready to announce. Then when your buds come over with the baby, you can let them know there\u2019s a convenient bathroom diaper changing spot. If I visit a home with a changing table, the host will let me know where it is, and I\u2019m happy to use it. Otherwise, we\u2019re probably using the floor, or the furniture. \n\n*If you get a baby bathtub, you can put it on that bathroom counter (obviously you\u2019d take the changing pad off first), and it\u2019s the perfect height for bathing baby. Putting it in the regular bathtub (or in a shower) is not great for your back.", "Bathrooms are usually smaller and probably have piss on the floor. It\u2019s safer and easier to change baby on the floor. Now if she changed baby on your sofa, that\u2019s a different story.", "I have a 2 year old and I don\u2019t think you are the asshole, specifically because while I agree changing the baby in the bathroom might be weird, even on the counter (because they are hard), when I\u2019m somewhere with my daughter and she needs a change, I have a diaper pad that I lay underneath her to protect her and the surface, and that\u2019s pretty common with parents, or so I\u2019ve seen. \nI also always ask \u201cHey where is a good spot for me to change her?\u201d and respectfully discuss it with whoever is the host. \n\nEither way I don\u2019t necessarily think the bathroom is the best idea, even on the counter (because hard and babies heads are very soft and fragile) but I think you are NTA because they showed up without notice, with the baby, to a home that isn\u2019t prepped for a baby, and didn\u2019t clarify anything etiquette-wise with you. \n\nAnd for all of you saying that they weren\u2019t thinking about it because it\u2019s routine for them, they\u2019ve been doing it for 8 months. I\u2019ve been doing it for almost 3 years, and my mom has been doing it for 15 years with 3 separate kids (not even counting me) and we both *always* ask before we change our kids at someone else\u2019s house. It\u2019s just polite! That\u2019s their space. And accidents happen, but that wasn\u2019t an accident, and they didn\u2019t clarify they (or the baby!) we\u2019re coming in the first place! \n\nSo NTA, but if you plan on having them over again, negotiate a good place to change the baby.

I've lived places were starts at 6 means 630.  There are plenty of cultures where randomly showing up is socially acceptable and encouraged.

Sadly, sometimes you can\u2019t trust friends/family around your kids. I\u2019ve read a lot of Reddit posts about friends being inappropriate with children. It\u2019s so heart breaking how common it is.

I don\u2019t get why some parents behave in such an entitled manner. I hope they used a changing mat firstly because if not then that\u2019s gross. You don\u2019t just assume everyone else can stomach the stench of your babies poop just because you have to. The polite thing to do is find a quiet area away from a group setting. The floor is a safer surface to change a baby and if you\u2019re using a changing mat that protects your baby from a dirty floor it shouldn\u2019t matter too much which room is used but do it away from the guests. If it was a public space then the floor isn\u2019t an option like a public bathroom but this is a private space and should be much cleaner no matter the room. Also it was rude to just turn up without asking if it\u2019s okay to bring the baby. They can be pretty distracting when trying to play such a game.

Also, regardless of whether the floor is appropriate or not, people generally ask before doing that in someone else's home. I have seen parents visiting do this dozens of times in unfamiliar environments, checking with people is pretty common courtesy, and that is what most people do. I think this is very weird behaviour, and just because they are struggling with new parenthood doesn't mean very basic levels of communication (like, a single heads up text, or asking where is best for a baby change) go out the window.", "No one\u2019s quite an AH, but you\u2019re trending that way.

If you are saying having the baby near it is gross, then keeping your toothbrush in the same room is also gross.\n\nIt's a toiletry action. It can take place in the bathroom.
