They should be waiting for news of a safe arrival of baby, then you let them know when you're ready for the visit.", "NAH. I thinks it\u2019s reasonable to say that you want to wait until after the baby is born and see how things are going before you commit to any visits from people who have to travel long distances.

Maybe that autonomy could give you some much needed control in the situation?

Even if you give birth naturally, you\u2019ll likely still be recovering. Not to mention tired and not on a new schedule yet. \n\nBabies also have their own timeline. Just because you have a due date, doesn\u2019t mean the baby will show up then (my kids were all late - my middle being 12 days late lol), so they should wait til the babies here to see how you feel to book a holiday.", "NTA. Giving birth is a major event and it takes time to adjust to this new life changing normal! And if you have PPD following that, it makes recovering from everything take that much longer. As moms themselves one would think they could be more sympathetic to a new mom. I was just starting to feel like myself at 1 month post delivery and I didn't have a c section. I can't imagine how long it takes to recover from that. If they can't be more respectful of what you will have been through, then simply tell them to wait until you bring your precious LO to them. Your baby means your boundaries are to be respected!", "NTA not even a little bit.

As a first-time mother, you will need time to adjust to your new role and to recover physically and emotionally. It is entirely up to you to decide when you feel ready to have visitors and how many visitors you feel comfortable with at that time.\n\nIt is important to communicate your feelings clearly with your partner and his family, and to set boundaries that work for you. You can explain to them that while you appreciate their excitement about the new baby, you need some time to adjust and bond with your child before welcoming guests. \n\nIt is also important to consider your health and the potential for a C-section. Your recovery time may be longer than expected, and it is important to prioritize your health and well-being during this time. \n\nI think, it is perfectly reasonable for you to want to delay visits from extended family members until you are comfortable and ready. Don't let anyone pressure you into making decisions that are not in your best interest or the best interest of your new family.", "NTA- but like... it is the great grandma. As long as they are not staying with you 4 weeks after is ideal. You need some help then and the baby is more up for it", "NTA \n\nPeople like to forget that birth is not an easy experience and can take longer than 4 weeks to heal.

They are entitled to do that without your input. \n\nBut what you should do is set the boundaries with your husband. No visits if you say no, only stay for 1hr or what you're feeling comfortable with. HE will be hosting them, HE will be the one enforcing these rules/boundaries. And if he can't live with that. He can go see his grandparents by himself. And no flack from MIL at you. He needs to make it clear this is a joint decision. Be a team!\n\nI had a C-section, some bounce back in record time, others don't. I didn't. So it's important that you talk to your husband, if he isn't onboard taking on most of the \"heavy lifting\", then no visits.

I cannot think of the name now so if someone could help me out on the name, that would be great. But this comment is just fear mongering. \n\nHowever, OP, you do need to sit down with your husband and fully explain everything you're about to go through. Your body is going to be cut open (if you go the csection route) and you're going to have a MINIMUM of 8 weeks of healing. That's the minimum. Most women take longer. You're going to have no core strength. On top of that you're going to have raging hormones coursing through your body. You're going to be bleeding HEAVILY. And leaking with a newborn on your boob constantly (if you breastfeed). Family seeing the baby is not your #1 priority. Your child is. And you're #2 because you need to be able to care for your child. That's it. There's no number 3. If you want your husband to feel included, you can say he's #3, but in reality, he will be caring for you so his priorities need to be you and the baby. NOT HIS FAMILY. Please give him the full picture and if he's still insistent on having his great grandmother there, let him know you will be sitting in the living room with your boobs out in an adult diaper and you're not budging on that one....", "Yeah, there's a huge reason why great-grandma can't come. She's flying with a bunch of people clustered together to visit someone recovering from intensive surgery (c section) and a baby with a still developing immune system. Plus, hubby needs to be helping her heal not playing host for some entitled ladies who have apparently forgotten how painful labour can be. \n\nFamily meeting babies were common when they were actually helping with the baby, like doing laundry, changing nappies, meal prep, not standing cooing over the baby, while mama is intense pain and stressed. And something tells me the same people that tell a heavily pregnant woman when to expect them aren't the ones helping take care of the baby so the parents can rest.", "just curious, do you have any siblings? would they have been allowed to visit?", "And good luck to OP who has no family around and will be begging for support once baby is older and she realizes how important having a village is when she\u2019s in need of a babysitter or an hour for herself.", "They are asking to see baby at 1 month old. Not 1 week.", "yup, they definitely have issues because this kind of fixation and insistence on being right isn\u2019t normal", "The Great grandmother has to fly in, she is never going to be part of the 'village' raising this child. Her desire to meet a great granchild is normal but so is waiting to see how the birth goes first is also normal. \nNo one even knows when the baby will arrive so there is zero point in booking flights beforehand.\n I was 3 weeks late with my first, had a very traumatic birth followed by PPD, no way would I have coped with ancient great granny insisting on a visit before I was ready. Home was my safe space, there were medical and psycholical issues which needed to be addressed first. Redditors don't know what the future will bring, we can all wish OP well and that all passes smoothly for herself and for baby, and I indeed hope that is the case. But the key point is, we don't know, and I find your insistence on the right of an old lady to see a great grandchild quite bizarre. It's not like she is immediate family even. \nIt is up to the new mum and dad to take a decision after the baby is born and is safely home. If all has gone swimmingly then they may feel ready to say OK book your flights for a months time, but equally they may be struggling and do not want the baby paraded to elderly great grandparents; and that's OK too. \nYou need to wind your neck in, great grandparents do not have rights, in many countries grandparents do not have rights. The parents alone have the right to set their parameters, and if new grandma is so petty she refuses to be part of the 'village' because her mother has to wait a little longer then she is too petty to be in the picture at all. \nNTA", "I love that \u201cdrama much\u201d lol. You sound like a pick me girl it\u2019s a combo of cute and pitiful", "Your insistence that the mom not be a part of the visits is a little strange and if I was a new mom-to-be, it would be more than a little hurtful. The first 12 weeks are referred to as the 4th trimester and what the baby needs most during that time is it\u2019s mother. Supporting the mother during this time frame is the best way you can support the baby\u2014no matter what that help is and even\u2014*especially*\u2014if that help looks different than what you needed as a new mom. In the long run, creating a good, supportive relationship with the mother is the best way to guarantee a relationship with the grandchild. It is very easy to project our own experiences onto others but giving birth, nursing, and babies themselves are all very, very different. Some people recover quickly and fall into an easy routine, for others it is not that simple.\n\nWe can not guarantee when the baby will be born at this point. Planning a visit for 4 weeks after the due date is setting themselves up for disappointment in the event anything does not go according to plan. The baby could be born early or late and both have impacts on when the baby (and still importantly!!) the mom can receive visitors. The best thing they could do is wait until the baby is born and plan a visit at that point.", "On top of that, 6 weeks post-partum is generally considered when you're healed enough internally for some fun, so 4 weeks means you're still very messed up. You need time to not only heal but figure out your new routine with the baby. And all of this does assume that you give birth when expected and babies notoriously do not do the expected. You don't know if you're going to have the easy birth or the hard birth, you don't know if you might still be hospitalized (hopefully not) at that time. You don't even know if the baby is going to be fussy all day and night where no one in the house is getting any sleep for awhile. \n\nI'd say at minimum, you need 3 months post-partum before you entertain guests that you don't know (less than that for very close friends and family). But you need a chance to actually sleep and figure out who your baby is and what your new little family is going to be like before throwing interruptions into the mix.", "[removed]", " People ANNOUNCING that they are coming for a visit are extremely rude and inconsiderate.
