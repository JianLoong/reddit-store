They should be waiting for news of a safe arrival of baby, then you let them know when you're ready for the visit.", "NAH. I thinks it\u2019s reasonable to say that you want to wait until after the baby is born and see how things are going before you commit to any visits from people who have to travel long distances.

Maybe that autonomy could give you some much needed control in the situation?

Even if you give birth naturally, you\u2019ll likely still be recovering. Not to mention tired and not on a new schedule yet. \n\nBabies also have their own timeline. Just because you have a due date, doesn\u2019t mean the baby will show up then (my kids were all late - my middle being 12 days late lol), so they should wait til the babies here to see how you feel to book a holiday.", "NTA. Giving birth is a major event and it takes time to adjust to this new life changing normal! And if you have PPD following that, it makes recovering from everything take that much longer. As moms themselves one would think they could be more sympathetic to a new mom. I was just starting to feel like myself at 1 month post delivery and I didn't have a c section. I can't imagine how long it takes to recover from that. If they can't be more respectful of what you will have been through, then simply tell them to wait until you bring your precious LO to them. Your baby means your boundaries are to be respected!", "NTA not even a little bit. You have no idea how you're going to react to the birth, how well you'll be able to deal with you new responsibilities, how well you're going to do physically. Honestly if that person isn't someone who you are extremely comfortable with and you know is extremely helpful I wouldn't want them to be there in that situation, at least not longer than maybe one or two hours.", "\n\nIt is completely understandable that you do not want planned visits immediately after giving birth. As a first-time mother, you will need time to adjust to your new role and to recover physically and emotionally. It is entirely up to you to decide when you feel ready to have visitors and how many visitors you feel comfortable with at that time.\n\nIt is important to communicate your feelings clearly with your partner and his family, and to set boundaries that work for you. You can explain to them that while you appreciate their excitement about the new baby, you need some time to adjust and bond with your child before welcoming guests. \n\nIt is also important to consider your health and the potential for a C-section. Your recovery time may be longer than expected, and it is important to prioritize your health and well-being during this time. \n\nI think, it is perfectly reasonable for you to want to delay visits from extended family members until you are comfortable and ready. Don't let anyone pressure you into making decisions that are not in your best interest or the best interest of your new family.", "NTA- but like... it is the great grandma. As long as they are not staying with you 4 weeks after is ideal. You need some help then and the baby is more up for it", "NTA \n\nPeople like to forget that birth is not an easy experience and can take longer than 4 weeks to heal. No one needs visitors during that time if they don't want them. People ANNOUNCING that they are coming for a visit are extremely rude and inconsiderate. They should have ASKED if that would be okay.", "Info: would they be staying near you and wanting to come over first thing in the morning and leave at bedtime or would grandma be staying with your MIL and they\u2019d come visit for a couple hours a few times during the week but mostly keep themselves entertained?", "I was going with N T A, but I think it will be NAH. \n\nThey are not staying with you, they are an hour away. They are entitled to do that without your input. \n\nBut what you should do is set the boundaries with your husband. No visits if you say no, only stay for 1hr or what you're feeling comfortable with. HE will be hosting them, HE will be the one enforcing these rules/boundaries. And if he can't live with that. He can go see his grandparents by himself. And no flack from MIL at you. He needs to make it clear this is a joint decision. Be a team!\n\nI had a C-section, some bounce back in record time, others don't. I didn't. So it's important that you talk to your husband, if he isn't onboard taking on most of the \"heavy lifting\", then no visits.

Unfortunately she doesn\u2019t have much family of her own. I don\u2019t think she realizes how much support she\u2019s going to need, especially after her partner goes back to work. It can be a very lonely and hard experience without having support. Her MIL sounds like the closest family they\u2019ve got.", "If you don't get this, then you clearly don't understand what family truly means.\n\nMoreover I hope that you're not  a parent imparting such beliefs.", "OP sounds like they don't want guests that early. That's not the same as not wanting to play host to guests, it's about privacy. Hiding in a bedroom wouldn't equal comfort.\n\nThe parents I know who have valued their privacy with their newborns have kept people away for a while while they bond with their newborns. Prioritising time with their new child and learning how to be a parent.\n\nIt's not alienating anyone to say, \"I don't think I'll be ready to have guests that soon and I don't want to make plans this early, I want to see how I feel after giving birth.\" Family should really just respect that and try to be understanding about how people may need privacy during their first few months as parents.", "And that\u2019s you. OP has made it clear that this situation will be stress her out more. And honestly regardless of pregnancy or not, guests need to be a 100% yes from everybody. Nobody should have a guest for a week they don\u2019t want.", "Good for you. That worked for you, your extended family dynamics, and your parenting-style. Not everyone is you, and you cannot impose your parenting values on others.", "Do people who insist on visiting you when you\u2019d prefer they not visit and don\u2019t seem to care about you as a person seem overly supportive to you?", "Because I\u2019m not obsessed with babies and willing to impose my will on other people\u2014to the extent that I believe my right to meet a baby is more important than their own bonding experience and comfort\u2014, I don\u2019t know what family means?", "They aren\u2019t a guest for a week. We are talking about a few hours spread out over a few days tops. Especially if they are staying with MIL who lives an hour away.", "Exactly. None of the people who did this with us have ever been an actual parenting support. They\u2019ve been a drain from day 1.", "People be baby crazy.", "Because you're out of touch with what family means to those that it actually means something to. I appreciate that your personal situation is clearly one where you don't give a damn about family. But that's why you're so clearly pro the op's opinion.", "Whew. That\u2019s a lot of projection you\u2019re putting onto me and a lot of misguided anger. Seek help, friend."]}
