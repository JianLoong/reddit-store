Whole family should be mad at the irresponsible father.  A work emergency does not mean you can drop off your son with any relative on no notice.  Your brother needs to change jobs.  Or make a deal with a local day-care for this specific reason (work emergencies)", "NTA. *Plus we told him no, and he still gave him to us.* Bro is lucky that your wife took his kid to your dad's house instead of calling CPS or the police. What he did was extremely rude & irresponsible.", "NTA. A work emergency isn\u2019t enough of an emergency to take precedence over you having COVID.

Your dad is mad at him because he\u2019s being an AH.", "INFO: \n\nIs there a reason your brother wouldn\u2019t want his son with your dad? Do they have a bad relationship?

There are no work emergencies that would excuse him for dropping off a baby at a home where a person is sick with Covid.  It's actually neglect on his part.  What if the baby gets Covid?  Even surgeons have back-ups to handle their patients, so nothing is an emergency.", "And he didn\u2019t call and let anyone know before it\u2019s happened", "He does know I have COVID, he knew about it 2 weeks ago", "He never said how long, plus I think that was rude and stupid\n\nPlus we told him no, and he still gave him to us", "At that point, that does not really matter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey were nice, the second option was CPS.", "That\u2019s what I was saying", "He never called nobody", "Wow. He dropped a 1 y/o off with someone who has COVID. Just\u2026 wow. NTA of course, and this is almost CPS-worthy.", "Ok, your brother could have not drop him up at your house,feel better Op", "NTA for the nephew thing. But you need to talk to your son about letting the grownups work through their issues and not get involved. Tell him you love him, but brothers fight sometimes and he doesn\u2019t need you to go into the ring for you", "Yeah it was rude of your brother to drop him off without warning. But your story didn\u2019t give a lot of context to the entire situation. \n\nSo you answered two questions: he didn\u2019t indicate how long, and you guys did tell him no. \n\nNow, once again: is there a reason why he wouldn\u2019t want his son with your dad? Would there have been a better person to call to come get the child (like perhaps the child\u2019s mother? Or anyone else that wouldn\u2019t have upset your brother?) \n\nAnd what is the nature of the emergency? Was this a life or death situation that required your brothers attention?", "That\u2019s what I was saying, work emergency but don\u2019t call anyone", "Why does it matter? OP had COVID. Why would he want to him where someone has Covid anyway? even an hour in that house would be too long.", "There was no reason he didn't want him with my dad,", "I imagine it matters if dad is abusive or has a drug problem. Sometimes there's a VERY good reason certain family members are not on the babysitting list.\n\nOp is still NTA.", "I think the nature of the emergency and the relationship with dad matters. \n\nOP is NTA if: \n1.) the work emergency is: Sandra called off and they needed this dude to come in \u201cright away\u201d\n2.) dad is out of the way for picking the kid up and the guy is pissy that he\u2019s gonna drive further to get his child later \n\nOPA is TA if: \n1.) work emergency is that BIL is a social worker and a child on his caseload has been put in serious danger and he needs to go handle that NOW \n2.) dad is abusive or severely disabled and completely unable to safely care for this baby. \n\nLike the nature of the situation matters a lot here. Either way, the BIL should have had a better plan for child care, it wasn\u2019t great to just drop baby off after being told no. But the facts surrounding this situation really impact how necessary it was or how unnecessary it was to take baby to dads house.", "I get that. I meant why does it matter how Iong and why.", "I disagree. It doesn\u2019t matter what the emergency is when it puts your child in danger. Leaving a child with a sick person endangers your child for more than just Covid as well. If OP isn\u2019t feeling well, this could be bad.", "Okay. I think you\u2019re wrong, obviously. But you can have your opinion? Lol", "NTA. But your son seems a bit too big for his shoes lol.", "NTA but your 16 year old son had no business butting in and sending an \u201cangry\u201d text message to him", "NTA, no such thing as a \"work emergency\".", "NTA. You don't leave a healthy infant with a sick person. The person who is sick can't rest to get better and the infant could get sick too.\n\nAnd you never drop a child off with someone without calling ahead to make sure a)its okay to and b) theres someone home who could take care of them.", "NTA no one is entitled to free babysitting. No excuses.\n\nYour sick. You did what you could to keep the baby from getting sick.\n\nParents need to realize that NO means NO. Stop trying to force people who don\u2019t want to watch your kids to babysit", "NTA He didn't choose your dad, probably because your dad would have IMMEDIATELY refused. NTA"]}
