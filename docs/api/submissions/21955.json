You wanted to be able to enjoy your movie, not her loud dialogue. You weren't wrong for telling her to shut up. And you only did so after she loudly insulted you.", "This is the reason I hate going to see a film. NTA", "NTA. You started off polite, she escalated. You responded in kind. If someone can't keep their mouth shut, they shouldn't go to the movies. I often speak aloud to myself even while watching something at home, but I keep my mouth shut if I go to a theater to watch something or even if there are other people watching with me, it's just basic courtesy, and if someone responds to a polite \"shh\" with \"fuck you\", responding with \"shut the fuck up\" is pretty reasonable to me. You didn't bring out the \"fuck\", she did.", "NTA\n\nI'm glad you said something and that someone else went and got staff who actually did something about it.", "NTA.  At least she got kicked out.  I stopped going to theaters before the pandemic because the staff at the local theaters are totally spineless and won't kick anyone out.  The most they will do is offer a gift card for a future showing.  Why the hell would I want that when it's just as likely to happen again?  Now with Covid, there's no way I would ever sit in an enclosed space like that unless it was truly a once in a lifetime event.", "NTA because I hate folks who talk in the movies like that. You tried to do it quietly, your response was justified when she cursed at you. Of course I'd hesitate to do this in the US, as you never know if someone has a gun and could become violent.", "NTA. You pay money to watch a movie, not to listen to someone making noise. I had this too, but these people stopped behaving like that after a couple of minutes.", "NTA...You did what many others wanted to do.  I remember the days when theatre staff took care of this sort of thing.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA, how did she even get in if she was drunk?", "NTA. Feel zero sympathy for entitled brats who get wasted and think the whole world is their stage. If she was drunk I hope the theatre got her a cab or called law enforcement if she drove off the property.", "NTA.  It was a horror film and she was an adult.  Not a child going to see a Disney movie.", "were you classy? no. but were you an asshole? nah. you tried to get her to shut up quietly, but she deserved to get kicked out. NTA.", "NTA. One person shouldn't be allowed to ruin the experience of everyone else.", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly to hell with people who talk during movies in a cinema.", "Happy there was at least one grown up in the room who went and got floor staff. ESH except for them.", "ESH. Her being aggressive doesn\u2019t mean you get to be aggressive. You both ruined the movie for others. Next time just get a manager.", "ESH.  She was obviously acting like TA, that requires no explanation.  But you making a scene in the theater didn\u2019t solve the problem, it just further disrupted everyone else\u2019s viewing experience.  The proper response if you were that disturbed was to step out of the theater and alert the staff.", "ESH\n\nShe was an AH for obvious reason.\n\nYou were an AH because you don't give your age but you imply that you're an adult and yet still think \"tattling\" is a thing, or that there's something wrong with getting a literal disruptive person kicked out, or that anyone wanted to listen to you shouting across the theatre any more than they wanted to listen to her. Your weird childish code of schoolyard \"ethics\" just left you being as much of an obnoxious AH as she was. Next time just be an adult and go get the bloody manager.", "ESH. Shouting \u201cShut the $&:! up!\u201d made the situation worse\u2014I\u2019m imaging cringing parents with teens and couples on date nights. Her problems with emotional regulation do not excuse yours. It\u2019s the mature guest who alerted staff that defused the situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This isn't Gogglebox!", "NTA. I have dealt with this in movie theaters, which is why I stopped going to them. There is always someone who will not shut up. You start out politely asking them to be quiet and then they get louder in response and next thing you know you find yourself flying over the seat with your hands around their neck and your husband saying, \"I'll just go get an usher.\" It's exhausting.", "I should have mentioned that when we left the theater the person was still outside being detained by either police or some sort of security. Her car was being blocked by the squad cars.", "[deleted]", "I should have added after I told this person off the place applauded so you might have cringed but everyone else seemed appreciative. I see your point but that person also paid it was an Imax film it was also with in the first 10 minutes of the movie. I also was spoken to by staff who gave my wife and I free tickets. I guess I should add as well this person was in the parking lot after we got out of the movie still interacting with police. I figure the person was drunk I didnt get kicked out for my response I got rewarded. But point taken.", "You are not the one who got her kicked out.  Stop trying to take credit for someone else\u2019s actions.", "In an earlier comment, OP said the applause was *after the person was removed*. Others asked him to stop taking credit for the guest who alerted staff. Now he deleted that comment and posted this.", "You're implying I feel like a hero or something. Thats pretty stupid when I am posting in subreddit called am I an asshole. I deleted the comment because I simply mistyped what I actually happened. Good job gum shoe.", "Your shifting story (and temper when confronted) are relevant to people judging.", "Youre also assuming that I am angry at you lol. Maybe you should stop assuming  You assuming I am lying to be cool on the internet or something which fair enough. Simply mistake on my end."]}
