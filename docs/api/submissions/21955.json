If someone can't keep their mouth shut, they shouldn't go to the movies.

I stopped going to theaters before the pandemic because the staff at the local theaters are totally spineless and won't kick anyone out.

So did everyone else there.", "NTA.  She deserved it and she got her just desserts.  Don't worry about it.  If everyone applauded, you did good.", " NTA. I hate going to movies. People having conversations and blinding you with their phones and apple watches because god forbid they not check their text messages.", "NTA, but you should have told her that If you have to turn around again, you\u2019ll take it outside and show her what it\u2019s like. And if she things you\u2019re kidding, just try me, because I would LOVE IT!", "INFO: was she talking during the movie or during the previews?\n\nEither way NTA, cause it was just a shush, but IMO talking during previews is less of an issue.", "NTA. Movie tickets are beyond overpriced nowadays, I wouldn't have let random pricks like that ruin our movie experience too.", "If I were there I'd hate both of you, bc how dare the public be the public in public... but I wasnt there so instead I applaud you. \n\nNTA", "NTA. This is why I stopped going to the movies. People genuinely treat the theater like it\u2019s their living room. Anytime I\u2019ve gone in the past few years it\u2019s been people talking and being loud, texting with their notifications on loud or even scrolling on their phone with the brightness up as high as possible. It\u2019s annoying.", "OP- a thank you from the rest of the people in the theater. im sure everyone was thinking it and wishing they had the balls to say something and thankful for you. if you want to talk during a movie wait for it to come out and watch it at home", "5 million dollars.\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "She was talking through the previews and then through the first 10 minutes or so of the movie before I took action.", "Or wont put their phone away \n\nI was always the first person to tell people, even if I wasn\u2019t the closest, 9/10 they would stop for the rest of the film.\n\nIts costs so much to go to the cinema these days, I\u2019m not putting up with inconsiderate people.", "Dude I went to watch a movie with my extended family. There was a kid playing a racing game on the phone. Now playing on the phone ain't a problem but the kid had the volume on full and it was really irritating to keep hearing a buzzing sound while watching the movie. Me and my uncle even told them to keep it low but they did nothing and the later started watching fucking YouTube videos. Finally all of us together in the theater told them shut the damn thing down and finally it stopped. Fucking entitled people I tell you", "Yeah NTA. When the movie begins, I feel guilty if I reach for candy and the plastic makes noise.\n\nPreviews are a bit more forgiving. I'll turn to the people next to me and say \"We should see that\". Or make a (quiet) joke about something ridiculous that happened in the trailer.\n\nBut yeah, movie talking is unacceptable unless it's a genuine gutteral reaction (laughter, a sincere gasp at the right moment, applause...some of the audience ambiance is what you're paying for)", "Nah. She was planning on sobering up during the movie, and you ruined it, endangering her, and the public at large. /s\n\nSo that raises the question, if she was drunk at the start of the movie, how did she get there in that state? At least they did stop her from driving off.", "> I feel cinemas, theaters etc need to be more proactive about telling people not to talk disturb others, silence phones and display warnings and signs about not causing disturbance.\n\nthey already have the signs and the intros saying not to talk and to silence your phone", "It's worse when it's a live performance.\n\nOur daughter has disabilities that make it hard to take her places where quiet and remaining in one place are expected.  My husband and I rarely saw anything together for her first 14 years!\n\nWhen she was much younger and smaller, and our parents were younger, they could help occasionally.  More often, we needed to rely on therapists as sitters.\n\nSo seeing some random jerk out with a baby at a play makes roll my eyes, at the very least.\n\nReally!?! They can't manage a single year of not subjecting others to avoidable disruption of performances?", "same\n\n\ni'm immunocompromised", "Dear god, that sounds heavenly! Sadly our little town doesn\u2019t have something like that.\n\nI would have love to see Dune in such a place. There were young teens next to us that were constantly taking out their cellphones, giggling and whispering. During a quiet part of movie, one farted to make the others laugh.", "NTA. Nobody is ever the asshole for telling someone to shut the fuck up during the movie. Never.", "NTA", "NTA. The hero we deserve.", "NTA. I used to LOVE going to the movies. Like we\u2019re talking once to twice a month I\u2019d go. But post COVID people have no manners (especially teenagers). So now I hardly go. It\u2019s so sad/annoying that people just threw social decency out the window after the pandemic. I\u2019ll give the kids a pass because lots of \u201cCOVID kids\u201d have social issues due to isolation at a young age, but the adults have no excuse they\u2019re just trash.", "if her car was blocked off she most likely made a scene outside the movie and was possibly arrested.", "NTA sounds like she\u2019s going to the special hell.", "\ud83c\udfc5gold medal for the reference!", "I went to see Schindler's List when it came out. During one of the most intense, horrifying scenes, the guy behind me pulled out a plastic grocery bag,  took out a giant apple and started crunching away on the damn thing.", "Been to one that will actually stop the movie cause someone was on their phone. It didn't even stop that person from keeping the conversation going.", "It's not horrible. It's probably best to just go get a manager.  Your response just escalated things. But, I would have applauded you! You were NTA, but you could have been better.", "I go to matinee when kids are in school and the place is empty.", "NTA - People like her are the reason I don\u2019t go to movie theatres anymore.

Yes I was applauded by some movie goers after my outburst.

Thats the fakest shit ever Lmao", "Psa if you live near a regal get regal passes. 21 dollars a month for unlimited movies, so basically go to 2 a month minimum and it pays for itself.
