I mean perhaps washing hair at a pinch but in general?\n\nAlso: what size is the bathroom? And where was said cloths?

Had it been one of his parents telling him to clean up after himself would it be a problem then? I don't get the YTAs.

Are you really okay with that?\n\nHe's old enough that jumping straight to punishment is ineffective and cruel. You need to have a conversation with him and the sitter.

I\u2019ll get them now. Sorry.\u201d Sitter needed to give little kid a bath. Sitter asked big kid to get his clothes out of the bathroom. A perfectly reasonable request. No one wants to bathe in a bathroom with clothes strewn on the floor. Big kid was being rude and a brat. I\u2019d be mortified if my child spoke that way to someone who worked for our family. For sure grounded. I am confused why 9 year old need help with a bath if not special needs, but that\u2019s neither here nor there, just strange.", "Well, it really wasn\u2019t the sitters place to tell Liam to move his stuff unless it was impeding use of the bathroom. So he overstepped there. But also your son was rude and should have picked up after himself. It sounds also like maybe there was a lack of communication on your part when making it clear to everyone who the sitter is actually watching and has authority over.

Even if the sitter isn\u2019t babysitting Liam, what the sitter asked Liam to do was just common courtesy and needed to be done for the sitter to run a bath, and Liam should have cleaned up his mess instead of mouthing off.  For that, I completely agree he deserves consequences.  \n\nThat said, assuming the springfest is a special event, the consequences you imposed feel a bit disproportionate to the offense, especially if this isn\u2019t a chronic issue for Liam. So you\u2019re a bit TA for that.", "Unless the 7 year old is special needs the sitter helping him bath is so fucking weird.  And who is the he who made the mess?  That\u2019s who should clean it up.   But in general you failed to clarify expectations and overreacted. Yta", "You\u2019re trying to raise a respectful human.\n\nEdit- I have to remove my N T A.

You never made it clear to Liam what the rules were, what was expected, etc, in what must be a super-weird situation for him. Imagine your old boss from work started hanging around the house. He\u2019s not your boss anymore, he\u2019s not even there for you. Then the ex-boss starts asking you to do stuff. That would feel pretty weird, right? Kind of emasculating as well, happening in your own house.\n\nAsk your son\u2019s forgiveness, explain whether he does or doesn\u2019t have to do what the babysitter asks, and remind him not to be a dick regardless. Make Liam apologize for not answering  the babysitter respectfully, but tbh, I don\u2019t see why Liam had to clean up right that moment either. The babysitter could have just moved his stuff over. Why was this even a thing?", "NTA.  Nip that entitled behavior in the bud.  No one's got time for that.", "NTA He learned (we hope) how not to treat people, especially those older.

What a lousy father!", "[deleted]", "NTA the sitter made a simple request that Liam should have already know to do. The sitter wasn't \"telling\" or \"commanding\" or trying to be the authority, he just asked Liam to do something. Liam was rude without reason. I think missing a single fun event will be good. While he's with you, have him explain why he was rude, and what your expectations are moving forward.", "NTA, he was rude to another person. Teenager or not, you need to learn and have manners at some point. Also, Liam is right that he is not his baby sitter anymore which is why the sitter absolutely does not have to clean up after Liam\u2019s mess. It\u2019s really not that deep though, it could have been worse. But Liam does need to learn to be more respectful.", "NTA.  Your son was.

The babysitter had every right to ask him to clean up his smelly teenager gymbag and smelly teenager clothes(Not saying that derogatorily, 17-year-olds stink) from the shared bathroom. Was \"Don't be a dick\" a little too much? Depends on the culture you're raised in.
