{"id": 9711, "submission_id": "10zumny", "title": "AITA For Showing Up To A Party With My Pregnant Wife That My Ex Was At?", "selftext": "Throwaway Account\n\nI (35m) used to be married to my high school sweetheart \"Kelly\" (35f). We got married after undergrad and overall I would say that we were really happy. The biggest conflict that I would say we had was the topic of children. Not the idea of actually having them but when. I've always wanted to be a dad and wanted to have my kids while I was still young enough to run around with them while they were kids and have a good adult relationship with them once they got older.\n\nKelly brought up a lot of good points about needing to get married, living fully on our own, and being out of debt first. For about five years I worked a job I had no passion for solely because of the large paycheck and I was able to nearly wipe out our debt completely (we didn't have a lot to begin with in the first place). Then Kelly said she wanted a house, so we got one, then a few months in she talked about wanting to go to grad school.\n\nEven though we often fought about children, in the end I always supported her choices because I didn't want her to resent me. I would often ask her if Kelly had ever changed her mind about wanting kids but she assured me that she still did, just not now. I asked when would she be and it always felt like she kept moving the goal post whenever she'd list her requirements, and that I was painted as a jerk for \"pressuring\" her for kids. Unfortunately, after weeks of not feeling well, Kelly was diagnosed with an illness. It was rough but I stood by her and she pulled through but the cost was her fertility.\n\nI felt like a jerk again because of part of me resented Kelly for not agreeing to have kids sooner and that resentment grew when Kelly refused to look into using a surrogate, insisting that either we were both the bio parents or neither of us were. In the end I couldn't take it and just divorced her.\n\nA lot of people called me selfish, sexist, misogynistic, etc. but I just wasn't sure if this was something that I would be able to truly let go of. I let Kelly keep the house and moved out of town. Eventually I met and fell in love with Angela (32f) and after shortly moving into together she got pregnant so we got married. She's entering her third trimester with our baby girl and I'm so excited.\n\nA friend back in college moved back to the states and wanted to have a small party to see everyone. He invited Kelly and me, so I checked in with him privately and asked if it would be okay to bring my wife and he said that it was cool so I did. This was the first time I saw Kelly in person for years and she looked well enough. I was polite but kept my distance and thought everything was good until the next day when I got a barrage of texts and DMs blasting me for having the audacity to parade my heavily pregnant new (younger) wife in front of my infertile ex-wife. I had no malicious intentions and it has been a few years plus I asked beforehand just to double check so AITA?\n\nETA: Talked about this with someone in the comments\n\nKelly said it would be too upsetting at the idea of me having a child with another woman regardless of how the child was conceived. It was either adopt or nothing at all. I honestly felt like there was no way we could progress in the relationship without one of us resenting the other so I filed.\n\nIf she truly didn't want kids she put on a great performance. Before her illness she would constantly gush over other people's babies, insisted buying a house in a good school district for our future kids, and even talked in extensive detail about wanting to be a stay-at-home for up to 6 years. I think Kelly just assumed we'd always have time and then life threw a curve ball.\n\nIf Kelly had stated that she would've been open to having children sooner under the condition that I be the primary caretaker I would've done it. I would've even taken a lesser paying job so I could have the free time to do it. I NEVER wanted to put in a position where she felt like she would have to give up her career entirely.  \n\n\nETA 2: Stepped away for a little bit but I just wanted to be clear about something. I did NOT leave Kelly while she was still sick. It was a year after she was healthy again and we had been in therapy for months.", "created_utc": 1676140939, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10zumny/aita_for_showing_up_to_a_party_with_my_pregnant/", "score": 2440, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not like you showed up with a pregnant 20 y/o.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you are an asshole. It\u2019s sad that Kelly is infertile but you didn\u2019t bring your wife to rub her infertility in her face. You reached out to your friend and you got the okay. Just block anyone sending you nasty texts. \n\nAlso from that you wrote, it sounds like Kelly never wanted kids, and she kept leading you on with the hope that you\u2019d eventually drop the issue. Divorcing her was the right move too, if not your resentment would have kept growing.", "NTA. \n\n\nIt's been years since your split. You were not parading Angela in front of Kelly. This sounds to be a case of people getting offended on behalf of someone else.", "NTA - You were invited and it\u2019s normal for someone\u2019s spouse to accompany them - plus you checked with the host in advance.\n\nI don\u2019t think you are an AH for getting divorced.   Differences in expectations around having children is a pretty common reason. \n\nYou haven\u2019t seen your ex in years.  Life goes on.  Nobody should be surprised that you married again and are having a baby.  I also don\u2019t think a 3-year age gap makes your wife a child bride!", "NTA: you're both adults being upset seems petty. My current wife has also been divorced by her past husband mostly around her infertility. He is newly married and have a second kid on the way. \nShe has no real feeling about because our marriage is great and we are happy where we are at together. \n\nSo yes the circumstances for your ex kind of suck. But if she was happy in her own life it would not be such a big deal to her. Also, you have no responsibility over other people's reactions etc. \n\nLive your life.", "I think 'Parading is in the eye of the beholder'. As you tell it there was no parading and if Kelly felt insulted, I assume it is totally on her. NTA.", "NTA. You were both invited to the party and the host said you could bring your wife. The world does not stop just because you divorced. People move on.", "NTA. Why should you even have to check that it was okay to bring your wife? You'd divorced and both of you had moved on. So if you hadn't brought her and people asked what was going on in your life you were supposed to lie and not say that your wife was pregnant? The people criticizing you need to grow up.", "You had no mal intent, so I'll say NTA. I understand that it could be difficult for your ex wife to see you \"winning in life\" but that's not something you have to plan your life around. If it's been years, she should work on moving on from the divorce and not having children.\n\nBut I'm glad you're finally on track towards your own life goals. Good for you.", "When people say they get a barrage of texts, how many different people are you talking about?", "NTA. As an ex, that person has no say in your life.", "NTA you both moved on and have different life's now. Your new wife just being there doesn't really constitute parading and you don't seem to have taken her there with malicious intent.", "NTA, you did what a good guest should and checked if it was ok to bring your wife. That is not the same as parading your pregnant wife and surely your ex could not have been surprised she was pregnant? Are these other people reacting to something she said? Or are they upset on her behalf (while she is not?).", "NTA. Shit happens. Your ex couldnt have known she'd wind up infertile. She had every right to choose when to have kids. But the truth is, every year that you wait is a year more for something to go wrong. Fertility is more fragile than people think. She's not to blame. She rolled the dice and lost.\n\nYou weren't misogynistic for leaving. The parameters of your marriage and your future changed. You're NTA for wanting your heavily pregnant wife with you at a party.", "NTA, you made it clear what you wanted in life and it wasn\u2019t happening. Y\u2019all divorced so she have no right to be mad at you. Especially when it\u2019s been some year since the divorce.", "NTA\n\n It's been years since you two divorced. And you met your new wife after the divorce. To me it seemed that Kelly never wanted kids, that's why she kept pushing the timeline. As for the younger comment, she is only 3 years younger, not 20.", "Of course you're NTA.  The assholes are the idiots bombing you with their whining.  If any of these people are \"friends\" of yours, rethink the friendship.  This crap drives me nuts!\n\nWhen you say you didn't have to take her, technically this is true.  But we don't live in the dark ages anymore, when pregnant women needed to be hidden.  Besides, what would you tell her is the reason?  She doesn't want to hear about your ex.", "NTA. She knows why you divorced, she knows you are or may be married and expecting, she knows what a pregnant woman looks like, and she knows that married couples typically attend social events together. So everything here is totally normal. You do not need to go out of your way to protect her feelings.", "NTA because you didn\u2019t have any malicious intent. I personally would not have brought my wife since (from what I understand) this is a get together for old friends, but on the other hand she\u2019s pregnant so it makes sense. Overall it doesn\u2019t seem like that important of a deal, especially since both parties have moved on. Have a great day dude", "NTA\n\nWhat did she think you were gonna do after divorce? Remain single and celibate? Wtf? \n\nYou were completely up front about wanting bio kids. The majority of the world in wants bio kids. Sounds like she didn\u2019t believe you at allllllll that you truly desperately wanted kids, and thought you weren\u2019t serious.", "NTA - first for the divorce the kid or no kid element is an important one to sort through. Secondly from what you described you did not parade your new wife around. You both can\u2019t change the circumstances or that she is pregnant (congratulations by the way).\n\nAs someone who has had fertility issues for YEARS and have wanted nothing more than a child I can tell you it would be a me problem if I got upset that my ex partner was now with someone who was pregnant. If anything I would be happy for them though secretly after the party have a good cry. \n\nRegarding the folks who DMed you - they seem to just love the drama. They probably were team Kelly post the divorce and are not too thrilled that you went in to find the life you wanted. I say f**k Em!", "NTA.\n\nHer infertility is irrelevant. She was never going to have kids. She didn't want them, she never wanted them, she wanted you and didn't care if she ruined your life to keep you.\n\nIt's not accidental that the goalpost kept moving further away.\n\nAnd she *still* doesn't care about your happiness. Even when keeping you is off the table she wants you to be alone and childless.", "100% NTA. You did absolutely nothing wrong. You and your ex were never actually on the same page.This finally caused a riff between you that caused a divorce. You are now married with a child on the way. Good for you!", "NTA.  They are really reaching when they call her \u201cyounger.\u201d Yes, she\u2019s 32 and you guys are 35, but that is a small difference. If you new wife was 19, that would be something for them to complain about. \n\nYou even got your friend\u2019s blessing to have her there. I have a lot of sympathy for infertile people, but pregnant people also have a right to exist in social settings.", "NTA - you wanted different things at different times and then life happened and you couldn\u2019t reconcile how you each wanted to live.\nSo you went your separate ways and Life went on. \nThe AHs are the ones blasting you for - moving on and having a family. . .", "NTA and the problem she ran into is a good reason why people shouldn\u2019t put off kids for too long, especially women. I get making sure that you\u2019re both ready at the same time but still, TOO much school and career is not going to help you achieve a family and kids. Fertility always has a window and waiting til the last minute is problematic.", "NTA - You\u2019ve had enough time to get a divorce, move, meet someone else, get pregnant, and married, so Kelly has had time to move on. You were incompatible as marital partners due to this issue. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault. You shouldn\u2019t have yo hide your wife now because of it. Refuse to engage with your ex\u2019s friends (as this is none of their business). Well\u2026actually\u2026I would engage with them just once to tell them that 32 and 35 are practically the same age\u2026so stop trying to manufacture drama.", "NTA, your first marriage looked like it was already heading for a divorce before she got sick. It really sounded like she didn't want kids and was just stringing you along. You have a new life that involves a wife and soon a kid. People can't expect to put your life on hold cause of an old relationship.", "1st off she's 3 years younger than your ex so they need to stop with the \"younger/trophy\" wife crap. You 2 divorced over real issues involving kids. She kept moving the goal post and then decided that if each of you weren't the biological parent then she didn't want to have kids with you. These are fundamental differences which would breakup any marriage. NTA.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry for your ex illness but sounds like she never wanted children and apparently didn't have the courage to tell you. Her now being infertile doesn't mean you can't move on with your life and have children and it's not like you rub in her face the fact that you're going to have a child.", "NTA Twice\n\nYou aren\u2019t the asshole here and man I got to tell you, you were definitely NOT the asshole getting divorced. Kids are a dealbreaker and your ex wife made several choices and unfortunately they didn\u2019t work for you, specifically her surrogate bs. Even the long delay was a sort of bad idea as anyone who has waited to have kids and then dealt with infertility issues will tell you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I still wanted kids and once she was healthy enough, I followed through on my original plans. But again, I wasn\u2019t heartless and I gave her the house and a debt free life. However, I really resent anyone who thinks I left because my wife got sick, I left because it felt like she was going to keep putting off the kids conversation until she could no longer have children, and it just happened that that came with an illness rather than old age.

Having said that, I can also understand your resentment given that you wanted children before your ex ever became ill.  It sounds as if the subject of children was an issue long before the illness.  It's an unfortunate situation all the way around. But you were sensitive to the possibility that bringing your new wife could cause an issue and addressed that before the party.

She does not want to raise kids.", "Sometimes, I will say that these things can be more complex than wanting or not wanting kids. My husband has always wanted kids, but he also has really bad anxiety when it comes to the big things. He wanted to get married but didn't feel \"old enough\" or \"adult enough\" yet every time we talked about it. Eventually, I just started planning the wedding, and he went along happily. The same thing happened with our first. If I did a check-in with how he felt about trying for kids soon, he was always noncommittal. Eventually, I just planned out when an ideal time to start trying would be, and he went along with it. He is not the kind to go along unless it's something he actually wants. If he doesn't want to do something, he very quickly puts his foot down. He wanted to be a dad, he's a wonderful SAHD now and adores our daughter, but if you asked him if he was ready, the answer was always no.\n\nThe ex could have been on the fence in the beginning and then decided against kids later and didn't know how to communicate it. She could have been using him from the beginning. Or she could be someone who was never going to feel ready even if it was something she wanted \"someday.\" If that's the case, then she probably had a lot of mental health problems after having that option taken away from her. Should she have robbed OP of the chance to have kids? No. But if she really did want kids and it had now been taken from her, I can see her setting a hard boundary for herself that she only wanted a kid if it came from her and he needed to either move past the kid idea altogether or leave. I don't blame her for her boundary, I don't blame him for leaving. I don't think he did anything wrong bringing his wife to the party, I don't think she was wrong for feeling hurt by it. I'd give her a soft Y T A if she was indeed planning on a kid \"someday\" and this hurt her, because she was justified in how she felt, but that doesn't mean she had the right to attack OP about it.
