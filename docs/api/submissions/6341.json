It is well within your rights to not tell them and have them calling and texting \"Any news?\" Every hour.  \n\nI would also say don't tell anyone for the first hour at least after your baby is born.

But I suspect you're thinking about the process of labor as something different than what it will actually be. \n\nEarly labor can last hour to days. Active labor includes the cervix dilating from 6 up to 10cm, and typically takes one hour per cm of dilation. Then active delivery/pushing can take minutes to hours.\n\nIn essence it's not a single event where there's no time to call or text family. If this is an average first birth, you will have a LOT of time.

It's your business & your husband's business; no one else's. Everyone else can wait until you decide to announce your child has been born. Throwing around terms like \"selfish\", \"diva\", & \"control freaks\" seems really hypocritical, since your mom is being a selfish diva by insisting that she needs by-the-minute updates as you deliver a child & throwing a fit because she can't have them, & your MIL is being a control freak by insisting on the same up-to-the-minute updates during delivery.", "You are the one giving birth.

They should only be contacted if (God forbid) something doesn\u2019t go according to plan. Other than that, they can simply receive confirmation that the baby has arrived safely. I feel like that\u2019s normal procedure for most families anyway.", "NTA it\u2019s your body and all that but if they\u2019ve been positive and supportive in the pregnancy and hopefully want to help out with childcare etc I think it would just be nice to tell them? Nobody says you have to update them but letting them know I just think is the kind thing to do especially if they haven\u2019t been overbearing. You can always just turn your phone off. Clearly they care and them knowing you\u2019re at the hospital won\u2019t change you and your husband being a team. \nIf they\u2019ve been a nightmare then yeh, just let them know whenever.", "NTA! The only person with any right to know when you're in labour is yourself.

However, their strong reaction leads me to believe they both play a very active role in your lives, and that will continue as their role as grandparents. So if they will play an active role, maybe a compromise can be agreed upon? Something that requires VERY minimal contact, but at least they\u2019re aware. The grandparent relationship (if you\u2019re expecting help from them), is very much a give and take. If they\u2019ve been involved and will continue to be involved, I\u2019m not sure if completely cutting them out of the labour process is the best approach. I think their reactions stems mainly from 1) labour is unpredictable and they\u2019re scared you could be in danger without them having any knowledge 2) it\u2019s a monumental moment and having zero notice is disconcerting (to them).", "NTA.\n\nTheir reaction suggests you are right not to consider calling them when you go into labour... but wrong to tell them what you were planning!", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101q58y/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_stop_spending_so/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nSame op, half an hour later is married with a baby.

Saying I'm in labour we're heading to the hospital will call when baby is here no problem letting you know so you can be there no no no", "NTA. I say this all the time on posts like this, you're having a medical event not putting on a show. You and only you get to decide who can be there. You should pick the person or people you are most comfortable with and that will support you and not stress you out. \n\nGiving birth is a scary, messy, vulnerable time. You'll be naked, bleeding, you will most likely poop when you push, you'll be exhausted and sweaty, in pain and scared and that's just a regular uneventful birth. You don't need anyone in the room that's going to take attention from you or stress you out. \n\nI didn't know I had a choice when I gave birth to my oldest and I ended up with my whole family barging into the delivery room. Everyone was jabbering at me and freaking me out and they were getting pissy that I wasn't responding to them. Then as I was pushing my mom stole my camera and started taking pictures of my vagina as my son was crowning. Imagine the scene, 26 hours of labor, I was in pain and pushing and suddenly there's bright flashes and the nurse screaming at my mom because she'd gotten shoulder to shoulder with the doctor and was practically shoving him out of the way so she could do a photoshoot with my shitty little digital camera. I learned my lesson and didn't tell anyone anything until after my youngest was born and I was in recovery. The only person with me was my husband that time. \n\nYou can make a list of people allowed to know you're there and allowed to visit (these can be separate lists if you want) and give the lists to the nurses and they will make sure no one else can get to you while you're there. L&D nurses are the best bouncers and will gleefully boot anyone that causes a laboring mother stress. I recommend just putting your phone on do not disturb when you go into the hospital and not turning it back on until you're recovering and truly ready to talk to anyone.", "Absolutely NTA!!!!

With the subsequent babies, we needed MIL to babysit while I was giving birth, which required MIL and FIL to know when we were going to the hospital and unfortunately allowed them to intrude on our moment with phone calls, turning up to the hospital, etc, which we had avoided first time.

It did not go down well with me and is still a sore point (they weren't allowed in thankfully).", "NTA this is completely normal. Like, I didn't learn that one of my sisters had her kid until the next day - she waited until the labor was over and she had a chance to take a nap before telling anyone. My other sister I only knew about the labor because she needed my mom to drive her to the hospital and I happened to be visiting my parents that day. My mom didn't tell any of the extended family except my grandma (her mom), and that was only for babysitting when she already had kids. Go in with your fiance, have the kid, let everyone get some rest after going through it - then you can deal with the stresscitement that comes with everything and every*one* else.", "NTA and their reactions was all the evidence that you made the right decision. You and your SO would be completely overwhelmed with calls and texts from the family and family members would be camped out at the hospital, trying to get into the room etc.\n\nMake sure you let the hospital keep you private and let the labor nurses know that NO ONE is to be allowed in your room, calling etc. They will be good at keeping your space safe.", " NTA. I\u2019m currently 8 months pregnant and something very similar happened to me. I told everybody I don\u2019t want any visitors for a few weeks due to rsv season and they flipped. Birth/labour is NOT a spectating sport. It\u2019s a very stressful & vulnerable time. It is NOT your responsibility to put yourself in an uncomfortable position to spare someone else\u2019s feelings.

No, you don't have to tell anyone when you go into labor. Actually, you might let the nurses know that there could be gatecrashers and to not let anyone in the room without your express permission. For them to react the way they did shows exactly why you weren't planning on telling them until after the birth.

It more came up because my MIL asked at what point in labour should she come to the hospital, so she just assumed she would be there for the birth, and so we felt obligated to explain that we just want it to be the two of us, but perhaps we could have kept the \u2018not telling them at all about labour\u2019 bit a secret. I just thought it was courteous to tell them our plan, and truthfully didn\u2019t expect such a strong reaction. Yes some disappointment, but not to react the way they did.", "Thanks for your comment, much appreciated! It\u2019s the fact that early can last for days is exactly why we don\u2019t want to tell them, because then we will feel obligated to schedule in regular updates, and will be worrying about keeping everyone informed throughout the process, instead of what we want to do, and that\u2019s concentrate on being a team, the pair of us going through the labour of our first child together. It would be a completely different outcome if my fianc\u00e9 had said he wanted his mum, or family to know, but he suspects, like I do with my mum, that as soon as we tell them I had gone into labour they will keep calling, and texting for updates, and would probably turn up at our house or hospital if we didn\u2019t answer. So that\u2019s why we just thought it was easier to not tell anyone. We don\u2019t have other children or pets or anything to do, except be in labour together. And in terms of regular contact, we\u2019ve got a great relationship with both, but we only speak to them on the phone once or twice a week, so it wouldn\u2019t be unusual for us not to speak to them for a couple of days, and if we were in labour they would be none the wiser.", "Now is the time for OP to show that her boundaries **will** be respected, or pushy grandma's will see consequences.  Their screeching and name calling pretty much proves that they won't be reasoned into proper behavior.", "Yes that\u2019s also me. I\u2019m not sure if you can see my post history attempt, I tried to post the other post 66 days ago, but it didn\u2019t work (I didn\u2019t respond to the 30 minute timer thing and so my post didn\u2019t post and I\u2019m not familiar with Reddit so just thought no one had commented). I just thought it was easier in the other post (which I just copied and pasted from 66 days ago) to say husband (we were days away from getting married but had to postpone due to illness in the family) and to say baby born rather than explaining due. Nothing nefarious here, just me not knowing how to use Reddit, and when I worked out what to do today for this post, because I\u2019m genuinely interested in others perspectives I just copied and pasted my other post as it\u2019s also still a question on my mind.", "Thank you for your comment! I\u2019m not trying to be antagonistic, but please could you explain why you would be \u201cheartbroken\u201d to not know your daughter was in labour, and only find out about the safe arrival of the baby once they are born? I truly want to understand your perspective. Thank you.", "lol, I didn't think of that.  At least the first delivery will be as they want it.", "The birth of a child is for parents and parents alone to decide who knows, and when.

She lost her mother one week before she had me (I\u2019m the oldest) and I didn\u2019t know if she had wished her mom was in the room or if she therefore wanted to be with me. Her answer was, no, she had no expectation to be there. Her reasoning was what you\u2019ve stated: she felt that the labor and delivery was a time for me and my husband to be together and start our family. She\u2019d come by when we were ready. \n\nIf you think you\u2019re up for it, you might ask your mom why she is so angry and adamant that she needs to be there. But either way, you need to do what\u2019s best for you during what is a challenging time. Good luck!", "First off, NTA. Labor and delivery can be worrying and scary, especially with your first. I\u2019ve got three and while some things seemed easier with each successive birth, some didn\u2019t. I had my mom there for every one of my children\u2019s births, though, because I couldn\u2019t imagine NOT having her there and my husband, as awesome as he is, didn\u2019t have a clue lol. I didn\u2019t have a clue either with our first and having her there to help support both of us was great. That being said, having your mom or MIL or anyone other than your partner there isn\u2019t for everyone. I think it is awesome you want it to be just the two of you welcoming your precious child into the world. Those first few moments as a family are just\u2026truly indescribable. I wish you the best of luck and I hope you have a fast and smooth delivery (I didn\u2019t with my first \ud83d\ude06) but I also just want to give some unsolicited advice lol. Labor and delivery is not a sprint. It is definitely a marathon. It is okay and 100% normal to have things not go the way you planned. Be willing to be flexible and lean on your fianc\u00e9 and the nursing staff and your OB or midwife too if needed. The end goal is not your \u201cperfect\u201d L&D experience, but instead a healthy beautiful baby, the newest member of your family. Blessings to you, your fianc\u00e9 and your dear little one. Don\u2019t feel bad to put people on an \u201cinfo diet\u201d if need be so you don\u2019t have any added stress. Let them know when you and your fianc\u00e9 decide you\u2019re ready and not a moment before.", "I didn't tell my family. I knew they would blow up my phone and want constant updates. I don't live in the same state as them and if I had, I know they would have shown up at the hospital. My family has a very controlling idea of what family is, it's like ownership. For example, my brother has a son that the family doesn't see often because my brother is an addict and the boys mother doesn't want her son around that (I completely support this). But my dad and other brother think they can just show up at his games and try to take him out afterwards even though he doesn't know them! \"He's my nephew/grandson, I can take him if I want.\" These are some of the reasons why I kept my delivery to myself and didn't tell anyone until after. You do whatever you are comfortable with remember, this is YOUR procedure, YOUR body, and YOUR baby. There is no perfect and painless delivery, you can't afford to focus on others when you should be doing all you can for yourself. Your mother's and mother in laws responses are very selfish and show that they aren't thinking of you and what you're going to go through. Some parents would be \"devastated\" as someone commented above but again, the delivery is NOT about them.", "I love her so much, I've shared all of her achievements/momentous occasions in her life, i would have lived through her pregnancy with her (she's only 18, so hopefully no babies for a few years Lol) and labour is such a momentous occasion, i would just like to know that she'd started so i would know 'right now she's going through this', kinda live thru it with her in spirit, knowing what she's going through. I'm sorry i cant explain better than that. I wouldnt expect to be at the hospital unless she asked for me to be for any reason. Plus I'd know my grandchild's life story from the first minute. ' you were ready to start coming to see us at 6pm on monday 1/1/11'.", "Wow it take quite a broken family to think that way.  I feel sorry for your two loss.", "This is exactly what I need. I will definitely be using this with my mother and mil.", "Thank you for explaining, that actually makes a lot of sense, and I feel like I have a better understanding now of the extent of disappointment my own mum and MIL are feeling. You\u2019ve helped me see their perspective clearer now. Thank you.", "Not a broken family. I just think that childbirth should be a private experience. Especially, when that is what the laboring mother chooses.\n\nI feel sorry for your adult kids. Because you are clearly a boundary stomping granny who thinks other peoples\u2019 birth experience is somehow about you.", "Aww I'm glad! I wish you all the best for your upcoming birth. If it helps, the moment i saw my daughter i said 'i would go through all that again right now cos it is SO WORTH IT!!!'. Words cant explain the joy and love you're going to feel when he/she arrives :D", "Please don\u2019t talk about all the love and joy she\u2019s going to feel because not all new mothers do, and to hear that can lead to PPD for an already struggling new mum."]}
