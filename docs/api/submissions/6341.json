It is well within your rights to not tell them and have them calling and texting \"Any news?\" Every hour.  \n\nI would also say don't tell anyone for the first hour at least after your baby is born.

But I suspect you're thinking about the process of labor as something different than what it will actually be. \n\nEarly labor can last hour to days. Active labor includes the cervix dilating from 6 up to 10cm, and typically takes one hour per cm of dilation. Then active delivery/pushing can take minutes to hours.\n\nIn essence it's not a single event where there's no time to call or text family. If this is an average first birth, you will have a LOT of time.

It's your business & your husband's business; no one else's. Everyone else can wait until you decide to announce your child has been born. Throwing around terms like \"selfish\", \"diva\", & \"control freaks\" seems really hypocritical, since your mom is being a selfish diva by insisting that she needs by-the-minute updates as you deliver a child & throwing a fit because she can't have them, & your MIL is being a control freak by insisting on the same up-to-the-minute updates during delivery.", "You are the one giving birth.

They should only be contacted if (God forbid) something doesn\u2019t go according to plan. Other than that, they can simply receive confirmation that the baby has arrived safely. I feel like that\u2019s normal procedure for most families anyway.", "NTA it\u2019s your body and all that but if they\u2019ve been positive and supportive in the pregnancy and hopefully want to help out with childcare etc I think it would just be nice to tell them? Nobody says you have to update them but letting them know I just think is the kind thing to do especially if they haven\u2019t been overbearing. You can always just turn your phone off. Clearly they care and them knowing you\u2019re at the hospital won\u2019t change you and your husband being a team. \nIf they\u2019ve been a nightmare then yeh, just let them know whenever.", "NTA! The only person with any right to know when you're in labour is yourself.

However, their strong reaction leads me to believe they both play a very active role in your lives, and that will continue as their role as grandparents. So if they will play an active role, maybe a compromise can be agreed upon? Something that requires VERY minimal contact, but at least they\u2019re aware. The grandparent relationship (if you\u2019re expecting help from them), is very much a give and take. If they\u2019ve been involved and will continue to be involved, I\u2019m not sure if completely cutting them out of the labour process is the best approach. I think their reactions stems mainly from 1) labour is unpredictable and they\u2019re scared you could be in danger without them having any knowledge 2) it\u2019s a monumental moment and having zero notice is disconcerting (to them).", "NTA.\n\nTheir reaction suggests you are right not to consider calling them when you go into labour... but wrong to tell them what you were planning!", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101q58y/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_stop_spending_so/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nSame op, half an hour later is married with a baby.

Saying I'm in labour we're heading to the hospital will call when baby is here no problem letting you know so you can be there no no no", "NTA. I say this all the time on posts like this, you're having a medical event not putting on a show. You and only you get to decide who can be there. You should pick the person or people you are most comfortable with and that will support you and not stress you out. \n\nGiving birth is a scary, messy, vulnerable time. You'll be naked, bleeding, you will most likely poop when you push, you'll be exhausted and sweaty, in pain and scared and that's just a regular uneventful birth. You don't need anyone in the room that's going to take attention from you or stress you out. \n\nI didn't know I had a choice when I gave birth to my oldest and I ended up with my whole family barging into the delivery room. Everyone was jabbering at me and freaking me out and they were getting pissy that I wasn't responding to them. Then as I was pushing my mom stole my camera and started taking pictures of my vagina as my son was crowning. Imagine the scene, 26 hours of labor, I was in pain and pushing and suddenly there's bright flashes and the nurse screaming at my mom because she'd gotten shoulder to shoulder with the doctor and was practically shoving him out of the way so she could do a photoshoot with my shitty little digital camera. I learned my lesson and didn't tell anyone anything until after my youngest was born and I was in recovery. The only person with me was my husband that time. \n\nYou can make a list of people allowed to know you're there and allowed to visit (these can be separate lists if you want) and give the lists to the nurses and they will make sure no one else can get to you while you're there. L&D nurses are the best bouncers and will gleefully boot anyone that causes a laboring mother stress. I recommend just putting your phone on do not disturb when you go into the hospital and not turning it back on until you're recovering and truly ready to talk to anyone.", "Absolutely NTA!!!!

With the subsequent babies, we needed MIL to babysit while I was giving birth, which required MIL and FIL to know when we were going to the hospital and unfortunately allowed them to intrude on our moment with phone calls, turning up to the hospital, etc, which we had avoided first time.

It did not go down well with me and is still a sore point (they weren't allowed in thankfully).", "NTA this is completely normal. Like, I didn't learn that one of my sisters had her kid until the next day - she waited until the labor was over and she had a chance to take a nap before telling anyone. My other sister I only knew about the labor because she needed my mom to drive her to the hospital and I happened to be visiting my parents that day. My mom didn't tell any of the extended family except my grandma (her mom), and that was only for babysitting when she already had kids. Go in with your fiance, have the kid, let everyone get some rest after going through it - then you can deal with the stresscitement that comes with everything and every*one* else.", "NTA and their reactions was all the evidence that you made the right decision. You and your SO would be completely overwhelmed with calls and texts from the family and family members would be camped out at the hospital, trying to get into the room etc.\n\nMake sure you let the hospital keep you private and let the labor nurses know that NO ONE is to be allowed in your room, calling etc. They will be good at keeping your space safe.", " NTA. I\u2019m currently 8 months pregnant and something very similar happened to me. I told everybody I don\u2019t want any visitors for a few weeks due to rsv season and they flipped. Birth/labour is NOT a spectating sport. It\u2019s a very stressful & vulnerable time. It is NOT your responsibility to put yourself in an uncomfortable position to spare someone else\u2019s feelings.

No, you don't have to tell anyone when you go into labor. Actually, you might let the nurses know that there could be gatecrashers and to not let anyone in the room without your express permission. For them to react the way they did shows exactly why you weren't planning on telling them until after the birth.

It more came up because my MIL asked at what point in labour should she come to the hospital, so she just assumed she would be there for the birth, and so we felt obligated to explain that we just want it to be the two of us, but perhaps we could have kept the \u2018not telling them at all about labour\u2019 bit a secret. I just thought it was courteous to tell them our plan, and truthfully didn\u2019t expect such a strong reaction. Yes some disappointment, but not to react the way they did.", "Thanks for your comment, much appreciated! It\u2019s the fact that early can last for days is exactly why we don\u2019t want to tell them, because then we will feel obligated to schedule in regular updates, and will be worrying about keeping everyone informed throughout the process, instead of what we want to do, and that\u2019s concentrate on being a team, the pair of us going through the labour of our first child together. It would be a completely different outcome if my fianc\u00e9 had said he wanted his mum, or family to know, but he suspects, like I do with my mum, that as soon as we tell them I had gone into labour they will keep calling, and texting for updates, and would probably turn up at our house or hospital if we didn\u2019t answer. So that\u2019s why we just thought it was easier to not tell anyone. We don\u2019t have other children or pets or anything to do, except be in labour together. And in terms of regular contact, we\u2019ve got a great relationship with both, but we only speak to them on the phone once or twice a week, so it wouldn\u2019t be unusual for us not to speak to them for a couple of days, and if we were in labour they would be none the wiser.", "Now is the time for OP to show that her boundaries **will** be respected, or pushy grandma's will see consequences.  Their screeching and name calling pretty much proves that they won't be reasoned into proper behavior.", "Yes that\u2019s also me. I\u2019m not sure if you can see my post history attempt, I tried to post the other post 66 days ago, but it didn\u2019t work (I didn\u2019t respond to the 30 minute timer thing and so my post didn\u2019t post and I\u2019m not familiar with Reddit so just thought no one had commented). I just thought it was easier in the other post (which I just copied and pasted from 66 days ago) to say husband (we were days away from getting married but had to postpone due to illness in the family) and to say baby born rather than explaining due. Nothing nefarious here, just me not knowing how to use Reddit, and when I worked out what to do today for this post, because I\u2019m genuinely interested in others perspectives I just copied and pasted my other post as it\u2019s also still a question on my mind.", "Thank you for your comment! I\u2019m not trying to be antagonistic, but please could you explain why you would be \u201cheartbroken\u201d to not know your daughter was in labour, and only find out about the safe arrival of the baby once they are born? I truly want to understand your perspective. Thank you.", "lol, I didn't think of that.  At least the first delivery will be as they want it.", "The birth of a child is for parents and parents alone to decide who knows, and when.

She lost her mother one week before she had me (I\u2019m the oldest) and I didn\u2019t know if she had wished her mom was in the room or if she therefore wanted to be with me. Her answer was, no, she had no expectation to be there. Her reasoning was what you\u2019ve stated: she felt that the labor and delivery was a time for me and my husband to be together and start our family. She\u2019d come by when we were ready. \n\nIf you think you\u2019re up for it, you might ask your mom why she is so angry and adamant that she needs to be there. But either way, you need to do what\u2019s best for you during what is a challenging time. Good luck!", "First off, NTA. Labor and delivery can be worrying and scary, especially with your first. I\u2019ve got three and while some things seemed easier with each successive birth, some didn\u2019t. I had my mom there for every one of my children\u2019s births, though, because I couldn\u2019t imagine NOT having her there and my husband, as awesome as he is, didn\u2019t have a clue lol. I didn\u2019t have a clue either with our first and having her there to help support both of us was great. That being said, having your mom or MIL or anyone other than your partner there isn\u2019t for everyone. I think it is awesome you want it to be just the two of you welcoming your precious child into the world. Those first few moments as a family are just\u2026truly indescribable. I wish you the best of luck and I hope you have a fast and smooth delivery (I didn\u2019t with my first \ud83d\ude06) but I also just want to give some unsolicited advice lol. Labor and delivery is not a sprint. It is definitely a marathon. It is okay and 100% normal to have things not go the way you planned. Be willing to be flexible and lean on your fianc\u00e9 and the nursing staff and your OB or midwife too if needed. The end goal is not your \u201cperfect\u201d L&D experience, but instead a healthy beautiful baby, the newest member of your family. Blessings to you, your fianc\u00e9 and your dear little one. Don\u2019t feel bad to put people on an \u201cinfo diet\u201d if need be so you don\u2019t have any added stress. Let them know when you and your fianc\u00e9 decide you\u2019re ready and not a moment before.", "I didn't tell my family. I knew they would blow up my phone and want constant updates. I don't live in the same state as them and if I had, I know they would have shown up at the hospital. My family has a very controlling idea of what family is, it's like ownership. For example, my brother has a son that the family doesn't see often because my brother is an addict and the boys mother doesn't want her son around that (I completely support this). But my dad and other brother think they can just show up at his games and try to take him out afterwards even though he doesn't know them! \"He's my nephew/grandson, I can take him if I want.\" These are some of the reasons why I kept my delivery to myself and didn't tell anyone until after. You do whatever you are comfortable with remember, this is YOUR procedure, YOUR body, and YOUR baby. There is no perfect and painless delivery, you can't afford to focus on others when you should be doing all you can for yourself. Your mother's and mother in laws responses are very selfish and show that they aren't thinking of you and what you're going to go through. Some parents would be \"devastated\" as someone commented above but again, the delivery is NOT about them.", "I love her so much, I've shared all of her achievements/momentous occasions in her life, i would have lived through her pregnancy with her (she's only 18, so hopefully no babies for a few years Lol) and labour is such a momentous occasion, i would just like to know that she'd started so i would know 'right now she's going through this', kinda live thru it with her in spirit, knowing what she's going through. I'm sorry i cant explain better than that. I wouldnt expect to be at the hospital unless she asked for me to be for any reason. Plus I'd know my grandchild's life story from the first minute. ' you were ready to start coming to see us at 6pm on monday 1/1/11'.", "Wow it take quite a broken family to think that way.  I feel sorry for your two loss.", "This is exactly what I need. I will definitely be using this with my mother and mil.", "Thank you for explaining, that actually makes a lot of sense, and I feel like I have a better understanding now of the extent of disappointment my own mum and MIL are feeling. You\u2019ve helped me see their perspective clearer now. Thank you.", "Not a broken family. I just think that childbirth should be a private experience. Especially, when that is what the laboring mother chooses.\n\nI feel sorry for your adult kids. Because you are clearly a boundary stomping granny who thinks other peoples\u2019 birth experience is somehow about you.", "Aww I'm glad! I wish you all the best for your upcoming birth. If it helps, the moment i saw my daughter i said 'i would go through all that again right now cos it is SO WORTH IT!!!'. Words cant explain the joy and love you're going to feel when he/she arrives :D", "Please don\u2019t talk about all the love and joy she\u2019s going to feel because not all new mothers do, and to hear that can lead to PPD for an already struggling new mum.", "NTA \nI get they\u2019re disappointed but that\u2019s not an excuse to berate you for what you want your experience to be.\nYou have your plan, there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. Plus baby will get here on their schedule you may have a long labor, a short one or need to be induced. Don\u2019t let anyone stress you out so you and hubby can enjoy your baby\u2019s birthing experience. \nWishing you a happy, healthy baby and smooth birth.", "NTA. I winded up having a C-section and texted a few people the plan bc I would be going in in the next 30 min. While in recovery and first getting up to the room (this was 1am-3am so up for almost 24 straight hours) my phone was blowing up asking me baby's name, etc. I was in PAIN, could not hold my baby, took 2 hrs to get a room post op and had no name. I was like \"I just got out, baby's here\". I had no stats or anything bc I'm trying to hold him for the first time while nurses are in every 30 minutes to push on your uterus and look at your blood clots and trying to get my pain under control and they're blowing up my phone over this. Just don't tell anyone. Enjoy your peace.", "You\u2019re going into labor. I think you\u2019ve got bigger fish to fry  then calling other people to tell them about it.\n\nThe hospital will treat your husband like he is invisible. Because he\u2019s not having a baby, you are. The hospital will not want your family milling around getting in the way. Your family can come after the birth, provided they can remember this event is not about them.", "NTA! I understand your mother\u2019s reaction. They are disappointed. They will get over it. I think your plan is wonderful! Take it from someone who has had 7 births. Your plan is perfect!!!", "NTA. What is with everyone wanting to begin the delivery room for a baby all of a sudden? When did this become such a huge social event?\n\nWait a minute. Could you sell tickets? Might help pay for some baby stuff. \n\nSell TICKETS!", "NTA when I was pregnant with 1st child I had a horrible time and the delivery was 2.5 months early. My husband took me to the hospital where I was life fighted to a bigger hospital. During my flight my husband drove the 1 hour to the bigger hospital awhile driving called my mom because she lived closer in case he didn't make it in time.  He did make it. My mom never left the waiting room once my husband showed and we told his mom the next day.  If it was a normal birth we planned to tell them after it was over.", "NTA.  With our first, we pretty much didn\u2019t tell anyone until baby was here.  My sister\u2019s best friend and her husband dropped something off at our house, and I told them I was in active labour (had already been sent home from the hospital once, lol) but they wished me well and left so I could rest.  She didn\u2019t even tell my sister, haha.\n\nBoth my mom and MIL are old Chinese ladies and would never in a million years WANT to be in the delivery room.  MIL came to visit in the hospital once we had announced the birth.  My mom said she had some sniffles so didn\u2019t come until she felt better, and we were already at home.  When she came, she showed up with a pile of groceries like cookies, croissants, apples, and pears.  All easy-to-eat snacks.  My MIL stayed at our place for a couple of weeks to cook us food and help with chores.  We were very much supported in very helpful ways.", "NTA. I was the same way wanted our delivery to be private although it was met with understanding probably because people know I am a more private person. I feel blessed to have been in the delivery room when my niece was delivered as my sister-in-law preferred but I was mortified of being in that same situation.", "Ya know, giving birth didn\u2019t used to be such a group activity. You waited at home for the good news, and MAYBE briefly visited the hospital in the next day or two. It might be time to get back to that model, because it seems that things are getting out of hand.", "Birth is not a spectator sport. You deserve to do this however you want to.\nNTA.", "Two people were present when the baby was made, two is plenty for when the baby is born. This is absolutely 100% your choice and this is right for you. It is not a spectator sport. Your mom and MIL have no right to be there for this private time. Stick to  your guns, your delivery needs to be the way you want it to be.\n\nI would make the hospital staff aware so they keep out anyone who tries to intrude.\n\nPrayers for an uneventful delivery and a healthy baby. NTA", "NTA - you do not want anything stressing you out.  Labor is very dangerous for mom and child, and even if things go textbook perfectly, you'll at least be very exhausted.  It is perfectly fine to inform everyone when you READY for visitors - either at the hospital or at home.  Nobody outside hospital staff/midwife truly needs updates on how far dilated you are.", "I waited 2 weeks to tell my mother when I was born.", "Let the nursing staff know you do not want any visitors until after the baby is born. That will stop anyone from being able to see you until you guys are ready.\nEdit to add you are NTA", "I've read this sentence way to many times and I still don't understand what this means \ud83e\udd2f", "I was born alone on a southbound train. Born to play the blues.", "No assholes here.  I think a fair compromise is you concede to tell them when you begin labor and are admitted to the hospital, because a new baby is a tremendous occasion for an entire extended family.  It\u2019s exciting for your moms to hear you and your husband are moments away from your first moment of parenthood!  I think your ask in return should be that no one shows up at the hospital until they are invited to be there.  It\u2019s lovely you and your husband want an intimate birth, and your family will hopefully respect that.  I think a few text messages is a fair compromise here as long as they agree to give you your space.", "NTA, my brother had his first kid last year and did the same thing. Of course that meant I had to play grownup and spend the afternoon calming my mom and MIL down when we didn\u2019t hear things for a couple of hours.  We got a text after he was born which was a huge relief to my mom who had confined herself that something had gone wrong.", "NTA OP! It\u2019s your vagina, your call.", "NTA\n\nTrust your gut.", "Hey NTA at all, it's absolutely okay for y'all to want this to be an experience just for the two of you. If you want to appease them, as long as they aren't demanding to be in the room or expecting to wait in the waiting area and see the baby immediately after birth maybe compromise. Only if you want to, tell them you will let them know when you get to the hospital (if that's an option, sometimes things are progressing very quickly in which case they can't expect that) but that they will get absolutely no updates and you will expect them to respect both of you and not be texting or calling at all until you have contacted them. Offer to let them know if there are any complications, but otherwise they will hear from you when the baby arrives. \n\nI'm really only saying this for you, I'm not sure how close of a relationship you have with your mom but I am very close with mine. For my first child I wanted it to just be myself and my husband but when it actually came time to start pushing I wanted my mom so badly. Sadly because I had told her we were doing it alone and it was very early morning she wasn't prepared to get to the hospital in a matter of minutes so she missed it. It was okay, I got through it but I wanted her so badly in that moment I wish I had told her to be on call... For my second child I told her I wanted her there. She was very thoughtful and respectful of me and my husband, she held my hand through most of it but right before the baby actually came out she pushed my husband up there next to me and made him hold my hand. \n\nHusbands can be great during that but in that moment some Mom's can be more comforting, especially since they literally know what you're going through.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know why you would want a team of people in the room while you give birth and are, effectively, at your worst. I worked in a hospital and patients asked me to kick out family members all the time because they hated that people would just show up to \u201cwatch them be sick\u201d. I know it\u2019s not the same, but you get the idea. I would also want to have this experience with my husband by my side and nobody else. It sounds exhausting.", "NTA. This is NOT about them. This is about you and your fiance.", ">\u2019diva\u2019\n\nYes, imagine wanting things exactly the way you want them when you\u2019re pushing a human being out of your privates. NTA.", "NTA. When my daughter was pregnant she asked me to be at the hospital, but not in the room. She wanted me close in case she needed me. I live 12 hours away from her, so I would have been speeding the whole way there. \nOn the other hand, when I was pregnant with my youngest, my MIL informed my husband and I that she was going to be there when our son was born. She was unhappy when I told her that no one but the medical staff and my husband was allowed in and we didn\u2019t want visitors at the hospital. My husband backed me up and refused to even call her until the baby was here. \nIt\u2019s up to you how you want to do things.", "Man this just gave me ptsd \u2026my mom is still bothered that I didn\u2019t tell her the moment we went to the hospital (wasn\u2019t sure I was in labor had horrible Braxton hicks also if I was in labor I knew I wouldn\u2019t be far along). Fmil i know she felt a type of way.", "NTA. I\u2019m childfree, but this was always my plan if we did decide to have kids. My mom is long dead but she respected boundaries like that\u2014she\u2019d have been in the waiting room if asked to be there, otherwise she\u2019d have been at home. My MIL, OTOH, is a piece of work who sucks the focus away from anyone having health issues and makes it about her, so I assume it would be the same with childbirth.", "Nta. I lost my first born due to premature labor. My mil was a nightmare during tgif difficult time. When we had our rainbow baby I knew I just wanted my husband and I. We maintained that boundary and I'm thankful. My labor was long and hard.\n\nLet them be mad. People feel too entitled. You're obligated to have anyone there. Many grandparents sure act like it is their right, but it isn't.", " NTA\n\nWe only told anyone about the birth of our kids when it was done. No one was dissapointed. Your parents and In-laws are very entitled. It is only up to you and your partner who may attend the birth or even who may visit in the hospital! Stand your ground, a birth is a very private thing where you just want to have the people around that you really need in that moment. \n\nIt does NOT lowers your love to your mother or such bullshit if she is not around. She will mostly of NO help. Same goes with In-laws. \n\nA birth should be about the parents of the baby and the baby, no one else. If you want to include someone else, it's up to you (of course the midwife and maybe a doctor or so will be there, bit they are professionals that (maybe) need to be there, totally different). And acting up like your parents and In-laws is ridiculous!\n\nTo add a short conclusion: NO is a complete sentence!", "Labor with my first child was 36 hours.  They even placed a fetal monitor on me. Wanting to know when my contractions were. Surprisingly I didn't feel strong pain just discomfort.  But the nursing staff was amazed that I wasn't in severe pain as they registered high. Had the sweetest baby boy. Second child was different needed epidural, was \u00bd that in labor sweetest little girl. \nGod luck & many blessings.", "Start doing long silences now. If she messages or calls you or your husband, take 12 hours to respond. Take longer. Let your husband respond on his phone when she messages you. \n\nBasically, act like you could possibly at the hospital at any point so that when you actually are, the behavior hasn't changed. \n\nAlso, register as a private name at the hospital and let staff know you don't want visitors. Many hospitals understand and can help you get that peace and bonding time.", "My comment wont lead to PPD - if a mother is struggling that much, then she already has it and should seek help, not struggle alone! I wished OP well and that includes her hopefully being one of the 94% of women who wont get depression. Mothers about to give birth need to be thinking about the positives, not stressing about all the what-ifs."]}
