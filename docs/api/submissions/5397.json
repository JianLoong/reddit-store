She has the right to recline, there is no secret law stating otherwise. Yes it was rude of her to keep hitting your knees but there was no reason to cuss at her.

The only solution here is to remove the ability to recline seats on airplanes.  If people can't use it responsibly (i.e., when there is no one seated behind you), then just take it away.  \n\nEven OP admits she uses it \"on really long flights\".  Even if you check behind you and it doesn't look like you are hitting someone, you are still taking away the 1 ince of free space they have to actually move their legs on a long flight. So OP, you are still a bit of a hypocritical asshole here.", "NTA, she got upset b/c you didn\u2019t allow her the typical conveniences she probably has received before due to old age. \n\nAnyway.

Yeah absolutely, sometimes tall people are behind you and you don\u2019t recline, she had every right to be irritated about it, but shouldn\u2019t have snapped like that. \n\nI mean really people, most seats recline like 6in or less (if you\u2019re in economy which it sounds like you were).", "There is no etiquette not to recline, unfortunately.\n\nLets do this step by step:\n\nYou didn\u2018t have enough space bc you brought so much luggage that your spot was packed, knowing that you have long legs: YTA\n\nExplaining her your situation: NTA\n\nExpecting her to accomodate your situation: YTA as you knew that this would happen with all the lugagge etc\n\nAs you made a sitation where she only can accept, no matter what: YTA\n\nHer, making a scene: you are NTA\n\nYou calling her bitch: NTA as it was just a response\n\nSo, it\u2018s 3 YTA and 3 NTA from my pov.\n\n\nIn dubio pro reo: NTA\nBut PLEASE bring less luggage and book a seat with extra space in the future.", "Air travel is awful.

Everyone I know that travels (myself included) has always understood that you only ever recline your seat if the one behind you is empty or if you check with the person behind you.
