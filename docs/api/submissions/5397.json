Now that the airlines cram in so many rows of seats, it is common courtesy not to recline.  You know you're screwing over the person behind you when you do.

The only solution here is to remove the ability to recline seats on airplanes.  If people can't use it responsibly (i.e., when there is no one seated behind you), then just take it away.  \n\nEven OP admits she uses it \"on really long flights\".  Even if you check behind you and it doesn't look like you are hitting someone, you are still taking away the 1 ince of free space they have to actually move their legs on a long flight. So OP, you are still a bit of a hypocritical asshole here.", "NTA, she got upset b/c you didn\u2019t allow her the typical conveniences she probably has received before due to old age. \n\nAnyway.

It\u2019s totally normal to recline your seat on a plane and I would consider that part of their space. This means if you\u2019re spilling into the seat next to you - buy another seat.

Everyone I know that travels (myself included) has always understood that you only ever recline your seat if the one behind you is empty or if you check with the person behind you.

Does this mean that the person in front of them can never ethically set off the reclining chain? Everyone has the right to recline, and if you don't like it you should ALSO recline, or pay for more leg room. YTA", "People are unbelievably rude sometimes.\n\nIf it\u2019s very early in the morning or very late at night and plane lights are off, then I think people should expect reclining chairs. But if it\u2019s regular business hours, I think it\u2019s pretty rude to recline and take up others\u2019 very limited space.\n\nI\u2019m going with ESH. Op, you did nothing wrong until you started swearing at a stranger on a plane in a public place. Get a flight attendant for help if another passenger won\u2019t leave you alone.", "In your first sentence you call me a liar. I'm now going to block you.", "What prevented you from placing your bag in the overhead bin? If you had done so then your legs would have had more space and she could have reclined her seat\u2026", "It is not a danger to have your bag under the seat in front of you. That's where they are supposed to put them if not in the overhead compartment. I am 5'8/172cm and even without a bag in front of me, my knees usually touch the seat back preventing it from reclining. It sucks all around.", "Why would you bring a bag onto an airplane that doesn\u2019t zip closed? \n\nHonestly your poor planning led to this, next time bring a bag that you know works and just put it overhead even if it\u2019s down the aisle.", "Honeslty, that seems like more of a you problem than anyone else... why are you bringing an oversized bag that doesn't close on a plane to begin with? I've had to put my bag further away from my seat but at least I had leg room. You seem extremely entitled to me", "ESH. You both escalated and swearing at someone never really helps the situation, even if they are being entitled. The seats recline for a reason. Is it nice to ask someone or be aware of the person behind you? Sure, but she paid for the seat same as you. \n\nPerhaps it's also time to get a new bag that zips so that in the future you can put it up and have more space.", "Yep YTA.\n\n\nYou planned poorly then insulted someone for using the plane *as it's intended to be used* while you yourself broke flying etiquette.", "Was overhead storage an option? Too often the overhead bins are full.", "I\u2019m only 5\u20198\u201d, but I\u2019m all legs and if I sit in basic economy, my knees rest against the seat in front of me.", "Agreed. I\u2019m a 5\u2019-9\u201d woman, and my knees are against the back of the seat in front of me, even when the seat is in the upright position.", "Because the seats are made to recline (just a little bit) and by getting on an airplane, you are accepting that fact. Some people might recline. Some people don\u2019t. You need to deal with it.", "AFAB (assigned female at birth) is one commonly-accepted term for expressing that duality. But whatever feels right to you works too.", "She said her carry on was large and took up all of her leg room under the seat so she wasn't able to stretch out her legs. So actually, she created this situation. Carry on less next time perhaps then you would have a bit more room for your legs and the chair in front won't bump your knees.", "Correct in order to ethnically recline the person behind you to recline, be small enough that they aren't inconvenienced, or an empty seat.  And no one has the right to recline, as reclining charges the status quo for the person for the worse.  And if someone reclines infront of me I will not recline my seat.  I will just unrealized theirs.  As for expecting people to may more you are assuming that they have the money to and also the freedom of flight choice to do so.  I fly mostly for work and corporate policy dictates I  fly in the cheapest seat possible and cannot upgrade it.", "Every flight Ive been on the attendants have announced not to have your bag on the floor during landing and take off. When in air its fine.", ">Why would you bring a bag onto an airplane that doesn\u2019t zip closed? \n\nIf it fits under the seat, why would it need to zip closed?", "Yeah, this is what I\u2019m wondering too. I have bags that have clasps instead of zippers, but I purposely don\u2019t use them when I\u2019m flying.", "It wasn't oversized, it was a regular carry on type bag. Idk how much you fly but they'rey really isn't much room under there.", "She said it was but her bag doesn't zip and it was \"further than she wanted.\"\n\nThis was a self made problem.", "What flights are you on? They all start by telling you to stow your carry-on _on the floor_ beneath the seat in front of you.", "Where I am from the explicitly say to stow you bags under the seat in front of you or the overhead compartment", "I mean I wouldn\u2019t want anything to fall out of my bag? Op said the bag contained fragile things it would\u2019ve broken if it had of fallen out.", "Which is why your carry-on bags are supposed to go in the overhead bins, and your additional small personal item goes under the seat.", "I have flown quite a bit and this has never been an issue for me. Perhaps air Canada plans are bigger but my carry on goes in the overhead and my purse/small carry on goes under the seat in front of me. I have even flown 18 hours to Australia and have never had this issue and everyone's seat was reclined.", "Nope. The overhead storage bins around her were full. That's not on her. That's on the airlines who now charge to check bags.", "Multiple England every summer since i was like 6, italy, france, spain, ireland, istanbul, india, hawaii, NYC, DC, Chicago. \n\nDo your flights not have over head compartments?", "It was though. It was a purse. I had another carryon in the overhead bins already.", "There were other open spaces. Op chose not to use them. That's a her problem, not the problem of the woman reclining. Around =/= all", "Just because the ones around her were full doesn't mean others weren't, I've had to store my stuff in overhead bins pretty far from me before. It's a give and take, want leg room, store your stuff above.", "When the overhead storage bins around you are full, you put your bag in a bin farther away from you or you suffer the consequences of keeping it under your seat. \n\nThe real asshole here is corporate airline bottom lines trying to milk the most money out of every flight. But individual passengers can still do their best to make the experience better for themselves and others.", "Usually flights have over head bins for carryon and under seat storage for a duffle", ">Nope. The overhead storage bins around her were full. That's not on her. That's on the airlines who now charge to check bags.\n\nWrong. Again, the overhead storage bins around her were full. That's not on her. That's on the airlines who now charge to check bags.", "Nope.  The space under the seat is also designated storage space, and a person sitting in their seat has an absolute right to the legroom without being reclined upon. I will absolutely die on this hill, and every flight attendant I've ever had mediate the dispute has agreed with me.", "Yes but the flow of traffic doesn't always allow you to do that, and you create  bigger issue by trying to go back there to store your stuff and then swim upstream to get back to your seat, plus no guarantee that anything else is even open. \n\nIf it fits under the seat, on a full flight chances are the flight attendants would tell them to put it under the seat anyway to clear the bins for stuff that can't go under a seat.", "I agree with your second paragraph. I disagree with your first.", "Sounds great for you, but I\u2019m not sure how legroom and underseat storage is more of a right than reclining. Unless by \u201cright\u201d you mean a subjective moral code you\u2019ve decided on yourself. Because I flew yesterday and 3 months ago and 6 months ago, and I can tell you the flight staff were not out and about defending the legs of passengers from the trespassing recliners.", "I guess we're just going to disagree then", "Now we're talking about philosophy, sources of law, and law versus morality. Heady stuff. Sure we can get into it on a Reddit thread? In any case, I stand by my prior comments. You don't get to trespass onto someone else and cause your seat to come into contact with them.", "That's fine!", "Do you think it\u2019s possible that the flight attendants mediating your arguments about leg room and reclining end up agreeing with you because you\u2019re an insufferable blowhard? That\u2019s not an accusation, just a question based on my flying experience. Squeaky wheels get the grease whether they actually need it or not. \n\nReclining a seat isn\u2019t trespassing  (a word with a specific legal definition) not matter how much you want it to be. You don\u2019t actually sound much different than the \u201cyou\u2019re everything that\u2019s wrong with the world\u201d insult hurled at OP, so congrats. OP and this woman both suck in different ways for making the flying experience of everyone else on that plane just a little bit more miserable than it needed to be."]}
