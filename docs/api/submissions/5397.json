Was I the asshole? I thought it was typically plane etiquette to not recline, or minimize reclining, as there's limited space.\nI do recline sometimes, if I'm on a really long flight, but always check behind me first, and if I was literally hitting someone by reclining, I'd feel bad, but idk. Thoughts?\n\nEdit: I'm not so tall that I need extra room, I had plenty of room until the last started reclining. She was trying to recline pretty far back so it was getting pretty cramped and I had nowhere else to put my legs.\nI thought the space under the seat in front of you was for bags anyway?\n\nEdit: My bag wasn't so huge that it was cramped or anything. The seating had limited enough room that just sitting normally, my knees were not touching the seat in front of me, but when the person started to recline, it hit them.\nI didn't have any choice here with booking, or what order to board in, this was a connecting flight, and my airline rebooked me on this flight (which was full) after a delay on their end caused me to miss my original connection.\n\nEDIT: I fully see everyone's point about people having a right to recline, and a right to the space they purchased (but also... technically didn't I purchase the space for a personal item under the seat in front of me?) and I may have overreacted with my response, but looks like no  one can read lol because I keep seeing comments that show how few people bothered to read this whole post.\n \n\n--I DID NOT HAVE A SAY OVER SEAT OR TICKET ON THIS FLIGHT. I could not have purchased additional space if I wanted to, this was a last minute rebooking after the airline's delay made me miss a connection. They put me on the next flight, which was packed and I had no say regarding seating, OR boarding order.\n\n--My bag was NOT overly large or overstuffed. It was just a regular purse, and lots of people store luggage under the seat in front of them. Just there was not a lot of space under the seat in front of me because said purse was there. \n\n--The only other available bin space was in the back of the plane. I was one of the last to board because I was put on the flight last minute due to aforementioned delay. I had another connection to make, and could not have waited for everyone else to deplane before getting my bag. \n\nI also chose to pack several breakable items that were Christmas gifts in my purse, SPECIFICALLY so that I could put it under the seat in front of me, and not worry about them getting broken in the bins or in checked baggage. Aren't I also entitled to the space under seat in front of me, since I purchased a ticket as well? That's where they always tell you to put your personal items, I've never had anyone tell me to put my feet there. \n\n--I was sitting normally, and did not/do not require extra space. However, the seating was in a way where sitting normally, I fit just fine into the space, but when she started reclining ALL the way back, she hit them. She did not ASK me to move or anything, just KEPT MASHING HER SEAT BACK INTO MY KNEES and glared at me, before turning and demanding I move. Not even a 'please' or an 'explanation'. I was not doing anything to purposely stop her from reclining.", "created_utc": 1671738466, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsv0qw/aita_for_getting_into_an_argument_over_someone/", "score": 1517, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The only solution here is to remove the ability to recline seats on airplanes.  If people can't use it responsibly (i.e., when there is no one seated behind you), then just take it away.  \n\nEven OP admits she uses it \"on really long flights\".

But this is such a controversial issue.  I have really long legs for my body.  And before anyone calls me fat, my BMI is well within the normal range for my height.   If anyone reclines they hit my knees.  Not their fault and not mine either.  Planes are a form of public transportation.  Just as I don't appreciate somebody hitting my legs while reclining, they should not expect me to fold myself in half so they can get that extra 1 inch of space.  They can go until they can go no further.  They should not expect that the person sitting behind them is four feet tall.\n\nYou were not an entitled person because you are tall.

It is NOT airplane etiquette to refrain from reclining.  It is airplane etiquette to avoid reclining during meal service.  Otherwise, it is the choice of the person who is sitting in their seat whether or not to recline.  I was a frequent flyer with status on multiple airlines for 25 years before I retired and flew well over a million miles.  You could have explained to her politely and she probably would have accommodated you.  Instead, you lectured her on airplane etiquette.  \n\n2.  I have no idea why your bag taking  up \"all the space under the seat in front of you\" has anything to do with recline.  The only way it could is if your bag was so big that it extended into your foot space, forcing your knees up.  If that's the case, bring a smaller carry-on or check your bag.  \n\n3. If you have long legs, then the problem is yours and not the person's in front of you.  Yours is a special need.  Book business or first, or fly an airline that provides better seat pitch.\n\n4. Any conflict with another passenger should be addressed to the FAs.  Confronting another passenger can never turn out well for anyone.\n\nIf you tried to lecture me about airplane etiquette, I would have put on my noise-cancelling headphones, turned on some music, smiled at you, and reclined my seat as much as I wanted.", "NTA.

We didn't get into any kind of argument though. \n\nI think if you had been the one to call the flight attendent, she would have asked the lady to stop ramming her seat into your knees. \n\nThey just overcrowd the seating arrangements in planes these days and there is simply not enough room.", "YTA", "ESH.

Like a 5-10 degree recline\n\nThat's what I'm thinking.  I'm always reclined and hardly even notice when anyone else reclines.\n\nPlus, you're right about cheap air travel.  We complain about uncomfortable seats and other inconveniences but it can be absurdly cheap to fly these days.", "Nah I fly once a month (in North America), and they always say they have little overhead storage so put whatever you can under your seat. We are heavily encouraged to use the overhead bins as little as possible. I travel with a backpack or computer bag instead of a purse (for laptop), and it takes up all the space under the seat - leaving me cramped. I am 5\u20195\u201d not even super tall. I have also had to put my legs into the aisle and that\u2019s inconsiderate to people who need to use the aisle. There isn\u2019t really much else OP could have done here. \n\nPeople do not have an inherent right to recline lol what was she supposed to do, cut off her knees? People have knees, them\u2019s the breaks. It\u2019s just common courtesy to not recline your seat on a plane! It\u2019s a shared space and only 4 hours, deal with it.", "I would bet its the latter. I highly doubt OP is a super model tall.", "They weren\u2019t sitting normally. OP\u2019s bag covered all the space on the ground so she didn\u2019t have any space for her legs. That\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault but the OPs. She could have easily stored her bag in the overhead spaces. \n\nOP mentions how her bags were overfilled and again that\u2019s nobody else\u2019s fault", "I'm 5'3\" and have had flights where this has happened, at least with the seat reclining (and not much better before). These cheap airlines are really trying to make the flying experience as uncomfortable as they can. Better for the environment, maybe, but it definitely sucks to experience.", "Agreed. I'm 5'10 but my legs are about as long as someone who is 6'3 or 6'4. If I put my feet on anything on the ground and my legs come up a little, the people in front of me are reclining straight into knee county. I don't mind so much, it doesn't bother me. Until they start complaining about my knees poking into their backs. Like - what exactly am I supposed to do? Stand up?", "Clearly people have strong opinions about this so I'd like to understand the other perspective better. I'm in the it's find to recline your seat crowd. The seats in economy aren't exactly reclining far anyways. I've never seen a case where I couldn't use my table when the person in front of me had their seat fully reclined. Statements like OP's saying the person was trying to recline \"pretty far back\" always seem overly dramatic because none of the seats I've seen in economy can recline far back. You only move the top of the seat 3 or 4 inches at most.\n\nCan someone tell me why that few inches at the top of the seat in front of you is so much more important than the person in front of you being able to recline a little?", "You\u2019re telling me you\u2019ll go 10 hours without eating because your tray is obstructed? Use your hands.", "I would never tell  a passenger that they cannot recline \nflight attendant 40 years", "YTA? Unpopular opinion: THIS. Shit we\u2019re all uncomfortable on an airplane. Might as well recline as the one relief to sitting upright in a box for the duration of the flight and have any semblance of comfort have any chance of sleep. I actually think OP YTA, god forbid we take advantage of the one possible option for any amount of comfort. But also in regards to the overall all design and functionality of airplanes EVS. I understand the frustration of being the one behind if BUT- **have you ever thought of also reclining to ***also have more space for to your legs to be more extended??***", "Yea but then if everyone reclines doesn\u2019t the amount of room/comfort just stays the same?", "Book higher than basic economy and you'll find room.", "Except they're winning with their strategy, so yeah, we kinda just have to pony up.", "I have flown on probably better then half of the world's airlines.  I am coming up on 2M miles with United, and have 1M with American.  I have never not even one time heard a flight attendant tell people to return their seats to the upright position during food service, on any airline.", "Like snacks or meals? I\u2019ve never been on a flight where they\u2019ve had people put their seats up for food. Albeit I haven\u2019t flown since 2019, but I used to fly quite a bit before that.  \n\nI\u2019ve also never had an issue with the reclined seat in front of me blocking my tray, so maybe I\u2019m just lucky.\n\nETA: I usually sleep the whole flight so maybe they have and I was just unconscious.", "ALWAYS travel with a bottle of [this spray water](https://www.evianspray.com/). Only ever need to use it is some asshat needs to either recline too far or stick their feet between my seats for no reason or keeps yanking on my seat. Then I feel the sudden urge to hydrate my face/hydrate the air I breathe for my non existent asthma or some other reason. It's water. But it does the trick.", "It must be a height/airline combo. I never take American for this reason, only delta, and never have a problem. American has the \"neck pillow\" built in right at my head height. I still don't recline on American, though - I just lean forward so my neck doesn't hurt.", "That's why they stick the unaccompanied minors in the last/back row (at least on Alaska airlines)! \ud83d\ude02", "Yesss! I've never not reclined and never heard of it being rude until very recently. I've also never been asked to un recline my seat for food. Plus the seats are practically leaning forward if you don't recline. Can we just go back to assuming everyone's going to recline??", "Yep, reclining should be changing the angles of your legs too.", "On short flights, I don\u2019t recline. But on long flights, hell yeah I\u2019m gonna recline. I paid for my seat and all the features it comes with. And guess what? The person behind me has those same privileges. People shouldn\u2019t complain about the person in front of them. They should complain to the airline. Everyone in economy gets similar space and similar seats and similar reclining privileges. \n\nIf they are too big or too tall to be comfortable when I recline my seat, then that\u2019s just life. I can never dunk a basketball or reach the top shelf at a supermarket, but I can be happy with the things in life that reward my features lol. \n\nOP should have bought a better seat that is appropriate for their size/length. If their knees are already touching the back of the seat in front of them, their legs are too tall for economy seating. Simple as that. OP is the AH", "You put in the fact that she said she's not tall, but ignored the part where she said she had long legs. She also mentioned before the lady was reclining, her knees were already touching the back of the seat. So to me, when she mentioned that she had room, that it was enough to where it wasn't hurting her.  If somebody's knees are in the way of you reclining, sorry you're not able to recline then.", "or better yet ... after they've reclined, fake sneeze really loud at the same time you accidentally spritz it over the seat in front. \ud83e\udd23 \n\ni know. that's evil. effective .. but evil.", "I'm American and the idea that it's rude to recline is baffling to me, too.\n\n-The armrests are for the middle seat.\n-Reclining is fine \n-If you get up to use the restroom frequently, get an isle seat. If you can't, give the people between you and the isle warning. They can switch with you or deal with it. \n\nThe real problem is with the airline packing us in for more profit. And then they let us fight about it and make the underpaid flight attendants with our tantrums. \n\nI'm a very consciousness person and I will never stop reclining on planes.", "I feel both these comments in my soul. \n\nMy mum just got a new car several weeks ago and damn is that thing lit up like a Christmas tree inside at nighttime, with seats so upright I feel like I\u2019m wearing a back brace!", "Hope you get some shut eye", "Sure but people on overnight flights arent magically smaller or shorter limbed, particularly not so severely that a flight half as long is less comfortable. Its just people being dramatic 90% of the time.", "Yeah, to avoid his legs getting split wide open like he's straddling the seat in front\n\nThere physically isn't space to recline, he's just making it very apparent that attempts will be shut down before they happen, rather than resolved painfully", "You didn\u2019t pay for the space their seat reclines into. You can pay more for extra legroom on flights, but can\u2019t pay for extra reclining room.\n\nIf you want more legroom, you need to pay more, not anyone unfortunate enough to sit in front of you on a flight.", "Same here.", "Suitcases should be checked in. Airlines should enforce this more.", "I just shove the jacket to the side when people do that", "People are saying if it fits. So I\u2019m that case it wouldn\u2019t fit"]}
