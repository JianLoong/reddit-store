It was not extra, but I had seen that the cost for extended legroom was about 20 euro. This was a larger plane so each side of the aisle had 3 seats, so window, middle and aisle. I didn't feel the need to get more space because I intended to sleep and its general sufficient space. \n\nAfter takeoff, the person in front reclines their seat. No problem, I recline my seat, but the guy in the aisle behind, but in the middle stops me. Tells me that he is too big and the chair reclines into his legs. This man seated in the middle is extraordinarily tall, and seated in the middle, so his knees extend into the space of both the aisle and window seats. People on both side of him now have their space invaded by his limps, and the entire row in front of him can't recline their seats (despite the aisle in front reclining and invading their space). A total of 5 people around him have minor inconveniences because of his height. \n\nI say \"Yea no problem, I won't recline my seat, but next time you can choose a different seat as to not inconvenience 5 other people\". He explains that normally the attendants give him an aisle seat or upgrade him, but they couldn't this time. I respond that it isn't the airlines responsibility to give him a seat, and if he knows he doesn't fit in a middle seat he could have chosen an aisle, as there was no charge to choose an aisle seat (I had seen the option the night before) or he could have upgraded for extended legroom seating for an extra 20 euro. He says he didn't have the 20 euro to spend (mind you he is flying to one of the most expensive cities in the world. I said choosing an aisle option is free, to which he says he didnt have that choice and that I am being selfish. I respond by saying \"Im not being selfish, I'm fine with having less space so you can be more comfortable, but pointing out that you're the selfish one for not taking responsibility for others space and depending on flight attendants to put you in better seats.\" \n\nHe thanks me for my opinion sarcastically, and I sarcastically reply that I'm just looking out for his best interests.

I'm over 6' tall and I'm also overweight. Because of that, I either try to save until I can afford business or first class, or I pay for upgraded leg room and  buy the seat next to me because the last thing I want is for somebody to feel like I'm infringing on their already limited space. It's still uncomfortable when you're tall, but that's not my fellow passengers' fault. When my ex and I would fly together in economy, we would both have to sit with our legs turned to the side to keep from hitting the seat in front of us. It's unpleasant but that's just how it is.  The Y-T-A responses surprise me, because would these people still think you were TA if the problem wasn't reclining, but that the person next to you was overweight and spilling into your seat? I somehow doubt it. I hate reclining and wish people wouldn't, but I wouldn't dream of asking them not to because they paid for their ticket just like I did.", "[deleted]", "NTA He should absolutely pay for additional legroom. As it stands, he is expecting everyone around him to settle for less space because he is unwilling to pay for more. It sucks for him that he can\u2019t be comfortable on planes without paying extra but that\u2019s a fact of life, just like how I can\u2019t reach high shelves without using a step stool.", "NTA we all have our own burdens, for him it's being well above average height. We are all responsible for our own burdens, whether or not its his fault that he's tall, it's his responsibility not to expect 5 other people to give up some of their comfort to improve his comfort.", "Nah\n\nExcept the airline, they are the AH here. \n\nRemoving one row of seats gives every other row a little room, 2 rows much more.

You chose to accommodate him which was kind. The airlines are AH for putting seats this closely together anyway.", "NTA you should have just reclined your seat and left it. Show him how cramped it is maybe next time he'll get on it and get himself a proper seat in", "NTA I have Muscle damage in my back I need to recline on planes I need to be able ot move around and fidgit. I pay extra for an isle seat in the extra leg room part of the plane so I am able to do those things. \n\nIf you need extra space its your job to book a seat that has it. No way in hell should 5 people have to deal with his bullshit because he's too cheap to pay 20 pounds for a seat.", "The airline is TA for not accommodating the fact that people\u2019s bodies need room.", "YTA\n\nYou gave an unnecessary lecture telling this guy how he should pick seats on a flight, from upgrading to picking aisle seats.  You also judged him for not already doing these things, when you don\u2019t know his circumstances or anything about him, really.\n\nUnsolicited advice is always an AH move.  And you dished it out in spades.", "YTA- You\u2019re acting like this dude CHOSE to be 6\u20198\u201d and therefore chose to make everyone around him uncomfortable\u2026mainly himself. Then you ASSUME he had the same options to choose a seat you did and then went about lecturing him on his flying choices. Don\u2019t you think he would have chose an aisle seat if he could? He could of had a different type of ticket that didn\u2019t offer him a seat choice or maybe had to make a last minute purchase due to a number of reasons therefore limiting his seat choices, but you decided to paint his story with your brush and be an asshole about it. It was a 1.5 hour flight, sorry you couldn\u2019t recline and it was nice of you to not, but you could of withheld the lecture.", "Eh, I am inclined to say YTA if only because you're making a lot of assumptions. You're supposed to keep the aisles clear for safety reasons, so even if he took an aisle seat, he shouldn't be stretching his legs out in them. And he might not be able to afford the extra costs to upgrade his seat. \n\nWhat really does suck is that airlines have shrunk legroom so much that even average-sized people are crunched for legroom and tall people have absolutely no hope of fitting comfortably into the seats unless they spend ridiculous amounts of money to do so. And maybe I should change my answer to \"the airline is TA here.\"", "YTA - did everyone around you clap too? \n\nRecline your seat if you want but you didnt have to start a fight with this guy.", "YTA\n\nIt's not your call how he spends his money or what money he has. He's flying to one of the most expensive cities is a bs argument. You don't know why he's flying there. Maybe it's for a job interview.\n\nMaybe his company has a policy against upgrading.

When we fly, we try to get the best seats to fit us. We show up early at the airport to try to also get exit rows or bulkhead seats. Believe me when I say flying when you\u2019re longer than the seat space is not easy or pleasant. \n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible (and likely) this man tried all the things and the seat he got was what was available. Moving your seat 3 to 4 inches is a slight inconvenience to you. Slight. Or you could put your seat back into his legs and he could spend the entire flight moving his legs into your back. Which I\u2019ve done and will do again, if needed. \n\nWhy do you assume to know what or how this man wound up there? And then chastise him for it? Isn\u2019t flying difficult enough without assuming negative intent to those also just trying to get thru the same difficult experience?", "Yeah.\n\nYTA here. You shouldn't have gotten into an argument with him. I'm a tall person. I try to get seats with extra leg room on a plane when I can, but sometimes I can't. Either not available or prohibitively expensive. I live in fear of somebody reclining into my knees.\n\nIt sounded like he wasn't an ass when he asked you if you could please not recline and explained the situation behind you. He didn't need a lecture, he sounded like he was acutely aware of his options and did his best.\n\nJust be a decent human being, it's a 1.5 hour flight, having your knees crushed is a much bigger inconvenience than it is for you to not recline.\n\nI mean, the real assholes are the airlines, but...not much to be done about that.", "YTA.

If he doesn't have 20 dollars to spend, a call to the airline ahead of time might get him exit row seating which tends to have more leg room.\n\nHowever, your free advice really started from the point of assuming he hadn't sought accommodation of any kind. Stuff happens.", "YTA, you act as if he chose his height. Also, you don't know his finances, he could already be stretched thin and that extra cost could be a burden.", "YTA for lecturing him. Just mind your own business and leave people alone. Do you really think your pearls if wisdom are going to change his view on this situation? Probably not. So leave it alone.\n\nThat being said, I would have reclined my seat. IDGAF, I'm reclining my seat on every flight, regardless of what anyone thinks. If you don't like it, take it up with the airline. If it is an available option, I'm going to use it and there's nothing selfish about it. We are all playing by the same rules, so how can it be selfish when the option to recline is available to us all? Is it not equally selfish to ask someone to not recline? No matter which option you choose someone's going to be uncomfortable, so someone's going to be unhappy no matter what. It's a zero sum situation. If the rules change, I'll accept it and operate under those conditions, but currently, seats recline. So, I'm gonna recline.", "YTA I mean he\u2019s right and you are wrong.

I paid a bunch of extra money once for legroom on a local flight from Singapore to Borneo, called ahead to ask if it would work for my height and was approved, and it literally wasn't possible for my to sit in a way that my butt was in a chair on the entire airplane. They were fine with me sitting in the aisle, but damn I felt like an asshole. Other times, I have been comfy enough in the middle seat of economy and not infringed on my neighbors at all.\n\nI would say that not having empathy for these issues is almost certainly born of pure ignorance and that OP is the asshole.

We upgraded to economy plus once for extra room and there just wasn't any. He hates asking people to accommodate him and would only ask if the seat was literally into his knees. He struggles on public busses too because the seats are so close together he can't fit his  knees in and has to sit sideways and take up the whole 2 person seat or sit on the aisle side.", "No the airlines are TA for cramming the seats so closely together that you can\u2019t recline without seriously encroaching on the space of the person behind you. I\u2019m only 5\u20193 but often end up needing to do work on my laptop during the flight. If the person if front of me reclines it jams the tray table too close to me, making it impossible to use the keyboard", "Some of us need back angle, not leg room.", "I don\u2019t understand how this is even rude. The seats recline for a reason. Why is it rude to use the buttons the airline gave you?", ">If they occasionally have extra tall humans, they should keep a couple of extra tall seats on hand.\n\nThey do. But since everyone wants the extra space they charge for them so they can allocate them efficiently (and make extra money). It's not a coincidence that there were upgrades available on OP's flight the night before. If they just let anyone who claimed they were tall book them, the 6'8\" guy still wouldn't get them because the 6'1\" guy met the arbitrary cut off and booked it first. This dude didn't think it was worth 20 euros.", "I would suggest that if you sell the seat to people who are not tall, then you arent really saving the seat for tall people.", "You're making it available for people who are tall. If you're tall, then the extra legroom is more likely to be worth it to you so they have those seats available for purchase. \n\nBut think about the nightmare airlines would face if they had an actual policy where tall people get allotted extra space. People would be putting lifts in their shoes to make the cutoff. 6'1\" guys would be arguing with flight attendants that they need that seat even though the cut off is 6'2\". The 5'8 guy would just book it anyway and throw a hissy fit when they made him move. And the 6'6\" guy wouldn't able to sit next to his 8 year old daughter.

Odds are he is in a sort of bubble where people don't call him out for being rude and he might not even realize how inconsiderate he is being.", ">issue people have in planes is leg room\n\nHuh? I'm fairly tall (6' with long legs) and find legroom generally fine, but I *cannot* sleep unless the seat is reclined.

He could have been a jerk and maybe you were condescending we can\u2019t really know. \n\nIn theory, you should have 100% (by airline rules) control over your seat area and are within reason to dictate how you use that space. You have control over what goes under your seat in front of you, your own overhead seat lamp, and your fan controls. That\u2019s pretty much it. After that, you can request it from the flight attendants, or ask your neighbors nicely. It would be lovely if we all agreed on a not/reclined position for every flight based on length of time, but every traveler\u2019s experience varies based on their own meatsuit qualities. Bc this is not possible and airlines choose to maximize profit over consumer comfort, we need to do what we can to support each other as passengers without setting ourselves up for failure. The weight of that decision can only be done by those passengers in that moment.", "I think the airline companies are the asshole here. Shitty pricing, tiny seating, bullshit waits at the airports. As a person who is short (170cm, about 5\u20197\u201d) I often find space in short supply. Admittedly I hate when my tiny amount of space is taken up by someone else who needs it, I don\u2019t like touching people.", "I just came here to say, does anyone remember when air travel was kinda fancy? You used to dress up and look nice for your flight.

He does not want to end up uncomfortable and in this exact situation.  \n\nI\u2019m going you are ESH. Lecturing him because of seat recline isn\u2019t your job. The 2 around him that have their space invaded SHOULD. He is the extra AH here. I am pretty small, and it drives me nuts that people feel entitled to MY space because I\u2019m smaller.

You don't get to demand somebody else spend money they may or may not have for your comfort.", "I was rdy to go the opposite way until he made it clear that he intentionally picks it with the hopes of an upgrade. Nta", "Meh. Sounds like he relies on the goodwill of staff rather than personal responsibility. NTA", "ESH. Him for expecting you, others around him and the airline itself to just accommodate him is very entitled. The person in front of you for invading your space. You for being judgy and condescending.

NTA", "YTA, the fact that he us flying to an expensive city does not mean he has the means to shell out an extra 20 euro every time he flies.  You don't know his struggles nor his financial state.  You dished out unsolicited advise, rudely so, and made instantaneous assumptions about him and his life.  Major YTA.", "And then everyone clapped, right? This reads like fan fiction.", "YTA - you are assuming a lot about him. Does it suck? Yes, absolutely. But you don\u2019t know his story, so don\u2019t judge. That said, the airlines are the real aholes here, and they know it.", "I\u2019m going to say YTA because people shouldn\u2019t have to pay extra for things like their hight which is out of their control. You don\u2019t know his circumstances, he really may not have had that extra money (it\u2019s also usually a few hundred more depending on where you book, not $20).", "You're a bit of an ass for the commentary on his flying to an expensive city. That doesnt mean he can spend more to upgrade.", "Jesus effing Christ on a crutch. The fact that this is even up for debate makes me sorry for humanity. Imma lay this out and hopefully y\u2019all CAN BE FUCKING NICE TO EACH OTHER. \n\n1. Airlines started off being an expensive way to travel, and they made sure the luxury was included. That meant leg room, wide seats, tray tables, reclining, meals, and liquor. Hell, they even let you SMOKE.  Even holding that image in my head post 9/11 and COVID makes me want to walk into the woods.   \n\n2. Yet people wanted this luxury to be even cheaper, so Airlines did what all business do, they followed their customers.  They lowered prices. But profits must stay up, so with the lower prices came less room, less amenities, and less convenience.  So what went first? Space.  You can still have tray tables, food, drinks, liquor, and reclining, but now just in a smaller volume.  No big deal, right? Well, hold on, because time is not gonna be nice to you. \n\n3. Airlines realized that it was way more profitable to take away the amenities while focusing on initial price. Then they can sell the same amenities back to you! So MAXIMIZE THE PROFITS! Now you can get a 1.5 hour flight for 60 Euros! Cheap! Everyone gets to travel! Woo!\n\n4. But now you are buying a little tiny volume of space in the sky for cheap, and the airline is offering you amenities (like reclining) from a bygone era. And if you imagine real hard, you can try to remember being royalty dressed in your pauper\u2019s clothing. So go ahead, recline like the queen you are darlin\u2019! \n\n5. Except wait, aren\u2019t you expanding your space on the plane? By taking away the space from someone sitting behind you? \n\n6. So now here is a 6\u20198\u201d (203cm for our non-American friends) guy who has purchased a 60\u20ac flight, who sounds like he is just trying to go about his day, now being encroached upon by someone he doesn\u2019t know.  And while I won\u2019t assume that he couldn\u2019t afford a better seat, I can certainly infer that he\u2019s traveling on a budget.  Why? because HE KNOWS he\u2019s 6\u20198\u201d and is still willing to suffer through being cramped in a middle seat. \n\n7. And along comes the newly minted queen of steerage class, lecturing him to go ahead and HAVE MORE MONEY.  While encroaching on the space he has folded himself into.  \n\nSo who is the AH here? Well in order:\n\nAirline Profits - YTA for wanting more money for less services.\n\nThe Traveling public - YTA for looking at costs over amenities, and not understanding how inflation works.\n\nTerrorists - You know why YTA, but y\u2019all just made everything harder. \n\nAirline Marketing Dept - YTA for selling luxury when you know it\u2019s cattle class.  \n\nOP - While I don\u2019t know your background, I am hoping you can see beyond your own navel. You are like a lobster in a boiling pot attacking the other lobsters, while you should be mad at the chef.  Good for you to ask if YTA, it shows some self awareness. But your lecture, your assumptions of others, and your 6\u20198\u201d imperial units reference (instead of metric) smacks of American Karen-ism.  I think you should check that, and just be nice.  So YTA for your entitlement. \n\nThe only person not YTA was the tall dude who folded himself into a tiny seat, and tried to go about his day.", "OP paid for her seat, and so did everybody else around the tall dude. OP was a saint for not reclining her seat anyways and saying \u201cfuck you.\u201d I have chronic back pain, and if I pay for a seat, I am not going to keep my seat upright because it becomes excruciatingly painful to sit like that the whole flight. Would OP also be the asshole for telling off a kid that\u2019s kicking her seat? Or someone that puts their bare feet between the seats?", "Hard disagree.", "Yeah! give me my armrest, you can have your recliner.", "No, not everybody reclines their seats. I never do unless I\u2019m in business class and have leg room, because in economy, I can\u2019t even let the person in front of me recline without invading my neighbors space because my legs are just that long."]}
