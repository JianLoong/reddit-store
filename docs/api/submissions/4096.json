Flight time 1.5 hours. \n\nMe (32M) I am 5'10 and I check in to my flight the night before. I wanted a window seat, so I chose window seat. It was not extra, but I had seen that the cost for extended legroom was about 20 euro. This was a larger plane so each side of the aisle had 3 seats, so window, middle and aisle. I didn't feel the need to get more space because I intended to sleep and its general sufficient space. \n\nAfter takeoff, the person in front reclines their seat. No problem, I recline my seat, but the guy in the aisle behind, but in the middle stops me. Tells me that he is too big and the chair reclines into his legs. This man seated in the middle is extraordinarily tall, and seated in the middle, so his knees extend into the space of both the aisle and window seats. People on both side of him now have their space invaded by his limps, and the entire row in front of him can't recline their seats (despite the aisle in front reclining and invading their space). A total of 5 people around him have minor inconveniences because of his height. \n\nI say \"Yea no problem, I won't recline my seat, but next time you can choose a different seat as to not inconvenience 5 other people\". He explains that normally the attendants give him an aisle seat or upgrade him, but they couldn't this time. I respond that it isn't the airlines responsibility to give him a seat, and if he knows he doesn't fit in a middle seat he could have chosen an aisle, as there was no charge to choose an aisle seat (I had seen the option the night before) or he could have upgraded for extended legroom seating for an extra 20 euro. He says he didn't have the 20 euro to spend (mind you he is flying to one of the most expensive cities in the world. I said choosing an aisle option is free, to which he says he didnt have that choice and that I am being selfish. I respond by saying \"Im not being selfish, I'm fine with having less space so you can be more comfortable, but pointing out that you're the selfish one for not taking responsibility for others space and depending on flight attendants to put you in better seats.\" \n\nHe thanks me for my opinion sarcastically, and I sarcastically reply that I'm just looking out for his best interests.

I'm over 6' tall and I'm also overweight. Because of that, I either try to save until I can afford business or first class, or I pay for upgraded leg room and  buy the seat next to me because the last thing I want is for somebody to feel like I'm infringing on their already limited space. It's still uncomfortable when you're tall, but that's not my fellow passengers' fault. When my ex and I would fly together in economy, we would both have to sit with our legs turned to the side to keep from hitting the seat in front of us. It's unpleasant but that's just how it is.  The Y-T-A responses surprise me, because would these people still think you were TA if the problem wasn't reclining, but that the person next to you was overweight and spilling into your seat? I somehow doubt it. I hate reclining and wish people wouldn't, but I wouldn't dream of asking them not to because they paid for their ticket just like I did.", "I just think reclining seats should be banned full stop. So unfair that people should be given the opportunity to encroach upon someone else's space and make their flight even more uncomfortable than it already is, just to make your own space slightly larger and more comfortable. The idea in itself appeals to selfishness and I hate that it's a thing.", "NTA He should absolutely pay for additional legroom. As it stands, he is expecting everyone around him to settle for less space because he is unwilling to pay for more. It sucks for him that he can\u2019t be comfortable on planes without paying extra but that\u2019s a fact of life, just like how I can\u2019t reach high shelves without using a step stool.", "NTA we all have our own burdens, for him it's being well above average height. We are all responsible for our own burdens, whether or not its his fault that he's tall, it's his responsibility not to expect 5 other people to give up some of their comfort to improve his comfort.", "Nah\n\nExcept the airline, they are the AH here. \n\nRemoving one row of seats gives every other row a little room, 2 rows much more. By packing people in line sardines, one person reclines and everyone in inconvenienced.", "NTA they force overweight people to buy an extra seat to accommodate their size, this man should have been made to do the same.", "Anyone reclining their seats on an economy flight is TA", "It should be noted that the individual was reclined, but the row ahead of him couldn't.

He had options that he chose not to deploy. He spoke up first requesting that you modify your behavior to accommodate him, so you had every right to reply. You chose to accommodate him which was kind. The airlines are AH for putting seats this closely together anyway.", "NTA you should have just reclined your seat and left it. Show him how cramped it is maybe next time he'll get on it and get himself a proper seat in", "NTA I have Muscle damage in my back I need to recline on planes I need to be able ot move around and fidgit. I pay extra for an isle seat in the extra leg room part of the plane so I am able to do those things. \n\nIf you need extra space its your job to book a seat that has it. No way in hell should 5 people have to deal with his bullshit because he's too cheap to pay 20 pounds for a seat.", "The airline is TA for not accommodating the fact that people\u2019s bodies need room.", "YTA\n\nYou gave an unnecessary lecture telling this guy how he should pick seats on a flight, from upgrading to picking aisle seats.  You also judged him for not already doing these things, when you don\u2019t know his circumstances or anything about him, really.\n\nUnsolicited advice is always an AH move.  And you dished it out in spades.", "YTA- You\u2019re acting like this dude CHOSE to be 6\u20198\u201d and therefore chose to make everyone around him uncomfortable\u2026mainly himself. Then you ASSUME he had the same options to choose a seat you did and then went about lecturing him on his flying choices. Don\u2019t you think he would have chose an aisle seat if he could? He could of had a different type of ticket that didn\u2019t offer him a seat choice or maybe had to make a last minute purchase due to a number of reasons therefore limiting his seat choices, but you decided to paint his story with your brush and be an asshole about it. It was a 1.5 hour flight, sorry you couldn\u2019t recline and it was nice of you to not, but you could of withheld the lecture.", "Eh, I am inclined to say YTA if only because you're making a lot of assumptions. You're supposed to keep the aisles clear for safety reasons, so even if he took an aisle seat, he shouldn't be stretching his legs out in them. And he might not be able to afford the extra costs to upgrade his seat. \n\nWhat really does suck is that airlines have shrunk legroom so much that even average-sized people are crunched for legroom and tall people have absolutely no hope of fitting comfortably into the seats unless they spend ridiculous amounts of money to do so. And maybe I should change my answer to \"the airline is TA here.\"", "YTA - did everyone around you clap too? \n\nRecline your seat if you want but you didnt have to start a fight with this guy.", "YTA\n\nIt's not your call how he spends his money or what money he has. He's flying to one of the most expensive cities is a bs argument. You don't know why he's flying there. Maybe it's for a job interview.\n\nMaybe his company has a policy against upgrading. (Mine does)\n\nPoint is, you don't know but decided to be a jerk because you THOUGHT you knew.\n\nTotally YTA", "YTA just because you felt the need to lecture him and get into this protracted debate.\n\nRecline or not, that's your call. Just because he asked for consideration doesn't give you carte blanche to unload on him.", "Yta. I\u2019m just over 6 feet and husband is 6\u20197\u201d. When we fly, we try to get the best seats to fit us. We show up early at the airport to try to also get exit rows or bulkhead seats. Believe me when I say flying when you\u2019re longer than the seat space is not easy or pleasant. \n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible (and likely) this man tried all the things and the seat he got was what was available. Moving your seat 3 to 4 inches is a slight inconvenience to you. Slight. Or you could put your seat back into his legs and he could spend the entire flight moving his legs into your back. Which I\u2019ve done and will do again, if needed. \n\nWhy do you assume to know what or how this man wound up there? And then chastise him for it? Isn\u2019t flying difficult enough without assuming negative intent to those also just trying to get thru the same difficult experience?", "Yeah.\n\nYTA here. You shouldn't have gotten into an argument with him. I'm a tall person. I try to get seats with extra leg room on a plane when I can, but sometimes I can't. Either not available or prohibitively expensive. I live in fear of somebody reclining into my knees.\n\nIt sounded like he wasn't an ass when he asked you if you could please not recline and explained the situation behind you. He didn't need a lecture, he sounded like he was acutely aware of his options and did his best.\n\nJust be a decent human being, it's a 1.5 hour flight, having your knees crushed is a much bigger inconvenience than it is for you to not recline.\n\nI mean, the real assholes are the airlines, but...not much to be done about that.", "YTA. You seem self-important based on how you wrote this.", "As a 6'6\" giant I can confidently say YTA, I would love to be 6' tall my life would be so much easier", "You shouldn't have gotten into an argument with him. ESH", "[deleted]", "YTA as a seat recliner by definition", "ESH\n\nHe should plan ahead for his height. If he doesn't have 20 dollars to spend, a call to the airline ahead of time might get him exit row seating which tends to have more leg room.\n\nHowever, your free advice really started from the point of assuming he hadn't sought accommodation of any kind. Stuff happens.", "YTA, you act as if he chose his height. Also, you don't know his finances, he could already be stretched thin and that extra cost could be a burden.", "YTA for lecturing him. Just mind your own business and leave people alone. Do you really think your pearls if wisdom are going to change his view on this situation? Probably not. So leave it alone.\n\nThat being said, I would have reclined my seat. IDGAF, I'm reclining my seat on every flight, regardless of what anyone thinks. If you don't like it, take it up with the airline. If it is an available option, I'm going to use it and there's nothing selfish about it. We are all playing by the same rules, so how can it be selfish when the option to recline is available to us all? Is it not equally selfish to ask someone to not recline? No matter which option you choose someone's going to be uncomfortable, so someone's going to be unhappy no matter what. It's a zero sum situation. If the rules change, I'll accept it and operate under those conditions, but currently, seats recline. So, I'm gonna recline.", "YTA I mean he\u2019s right and you are wrong.

I got stuck in the middle seat on a 15 hour flight, and boy were my knees and arms aching by the time we landed.", "No, the seat is meant to be reclined. Per airline policy, the extra couple of inches that the seat expands into belongs to OP, not the person behind him.

That's an asshole move. When someone behaves like an asshole, the rest of us should convey the message that they're behaving like an asshole. Most people feel ashamed for behaving like an asshole and reconsider their behavior in the future.", "The word \"pain\" isn't noted, just that they bump against his legs.

This is like tipping.  It's an asshole move not to tip.  The system shouldn't be set up the way it is and the restaurant should be fixing it, but until we live in a society where that happens, you're an asshole for not tipping.  Until we live in a society where airlines start treating people fairly, you're an asshole for not working within the system that exists.", "The guy didn't say he usually tries for more room. He said, he's usually given more room when the flight attendant sees how tall he is.

The US used to have one of the best and most reliable rail transport network in the World, after England and we decided to sell it off piece by piece to promote automobiles.\n\nJust as an example, Saint Paul and Minneapolis each had a light rail and trolley network that serviced the both cities and the outlying suburbs at the time and had more traffic than San Francisco's. But it was all removed to make way for more automobiles and trucks, despite neither city really having suitable storage for the vehicles.", "Agreed! I used to take 16 hour flights for work on a monthly basis. People need to be able to recline in their seats!", "If you feel that way then upgrade your seat.

I feel it's weird especially when people have trays with drinks on them.", "When the carrier has a huge recline then you can't use your tray table. When the seat in front of me reclined on my last flight the tray table was at a 45 degree angle to the seat. This was Virgin Atlantic. The recline on their seats is so large that the seat goes from upright to a 45 degree tilt. If you are the person behind that reclined seat you have trouble using your tray table. Even worse, the recline was so low on the seat back, basically from the bottom of the seat back, that the reclined seat was sitting on my legs putting them to sleep.", ">Just before the 1970s, the average domestic ticket from Dallas Fort-Worth International Airport (DFW) could cost around $48, according to Mooseroots. That seems like a small price to pay for a trip across the US. However, a $48 ticket in 1963 works out at about $467 today with inflation. For a similar ticket in this day and age, the cost variance isn't that different.  \n>  \n>Again, a domestic flight from Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport (ORD) in 1963 cost $43 on average. That figure is about $416 in 2022. In 2015, the average domestic flight price out of ORD was US$360.\n\nDone. Very similar price, much shittier experience.", "I feel for you.

No lecture yet, just noting that this inconvenient.

But I was responding to your comment that it wasn't his fault he was born tall... No, it wasn't, but he did nothing to try and mitigate his inevitable discomfort and ended up invading 5 other ppls space - and yes, not being able to recline your seat is an invasion of your space since the inch of seat recline is considered part of your space.", "No, initially I was not upset. I was suggesting that he upgrade his seat, for 20$, so that everybody would be more comfortable.

The top of the seats hit me in my neck when I\u2019m not slouching, and slouching doesn\u2019t help because the damn seats are still concave for some insane reason.

Those extra few inches really make a difference.", "A tall man, that\u2019s who.", "Horrifying fact! Airlines self moderate!

I'm 5'4\" so I've never said anything because I know I'd be dismissed. I've been on a lot of flights, and several over 8 hours, and having the person in front of me recline makes no difference.
