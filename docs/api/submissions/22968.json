This is a new human and you do not know each other, most of your energy is going to help andconcern for your wife and care for your daughter, who needs a lot of attention.

Treating someone as if you love them, even when they are annoying you, because of the commitment that you made. (Note: I\u2019m talking about \u201cnormal\u201d levels of annoyance, not abuse. That\u2019s a different conversation!)\n\nUnfortunately, as you have seen, new parents (both mums and dads) get a **ridiculous** amount of judgment if they don\u2019t fall in love with their baby immediately. \n\nYou will be fine. You have experienced that love with your daughter. It will come with your son. Just give it time. \n\nAnd reassure your wife, that you love her, and you choose to love both of your children - even if the \u201cwarm & fuzzies\u201d haven\u2019t kicked in yet for the new baby. \n\nIt is not perfect that your wife wasn\u2019t able to support you when you asked for her support. But that sometimes happens in couples - both people are struggling so they aren\u2019t in a place to help the other person as much as they maybe would at a different time. It doesn\u2019t make you an AH for asking for her support though. And she is not an AH because she cannot help you right now. \n\nYou are both new parents. \n\nIt\u2019s just kinda hard when a new baby arrives. \n\nKeep being kind to each other. And to yourselves.

It sounds like you were having painful internal thoughts and wanted your partner to help figure it out for you, without taking your own time to figure out your feelings.

A support group for specifically new dads could really be beneficial", "Naw im saying i told her my feelings because i felt like i\u2019d be lying if i kept everything in which made drama so i rather not tell her anything again", "Thank you it took me a couple weeks to feel a connection with my daughter", "You do know not feeling immediate love for your child is not abnormal, and it is probably quite a scary feeling not knowing if you ever will.", "Not in the same damned way! His hormones, his body, has NOT GONE THROUGH what a woman, postpartum, has just spent 10 freaking months going through. To claim that belittles what she has been through and what she is still going through! Her body is struggling to find an equilibrium that has t existed for nearly a year, her ovaries are pushing out eggs and hormones not pushed out since pre pregnancy...there is a chemical and hormonal imbalance that men will NEVER have to deal with or understand. Men's mental health is important but NOT TO THE DETRIMENT of his POSTPARTUM partner! He needs a THERAPIST. Go to your mother, your father, your friend, your priest, your doctor..hell..Google that shit....but don't tell a woman who just gave birth to your child 2 weeks previous that you feel NOTHING for the baby! She is in self preservation and Mama\n Bear mode over her newborn and you could get your face bit off...or...a divorce...like in this case.", "So he should talk about it with a good friend, or post on Reddit to ask other dads (since it's actually very common, men don't carry a baby for 9 months so it takes a while), but not his girlfriend right this moment. She just ripped from her v to her a to give birth to their child (yes, his as well), she's very sore, and she's looking after a newborn (you know, a small baby that keeps you up every night). Fluids dripping out of every part of her body, having all these different hormones, a stretched and destroyed body that still needs to shrink back into place (if it every fully will), but you think this is the time her boyfriend is entitled to a bit of emotional labour from her? Sorry, but no.", "Like she's not caring for them too!", "Sorry, a post partum mother with a 2 weeks old is not the right person at the right time to support and reassure him after a bombshell like this. I don't think you realize how much of an exhausted, raw mess that woman must be right now. Whatever you think he's feeling, she's feeling worst because she is going through the physical aftermath. He should have sought comfort from a friend or other source or waited longer.", "I get you. All this she just had a baby you dont get to unload is bullshit. A relationship is 2 ppl and they both get the same respect and consideration. Im saying this as a mom but also having a loving relationship with my hubbie. Hes got me, supports me, helps me and i do the same for him. Communication and truth is why we have such a great relationship. I dont expect him to suffer in silence, he should be able to tell me anything. If he told me this would i be concerned or upset,yes. But im his partner his go to, i would be gutted if he didnt tell me. He is human and allowed his feelings no matter how complex.", "You're right, he shouldn't. He should go to a therapist, or a friend, or a message board, or literally anyone else.", "Yes but it\u2019s not confirmed he has it. Unless and until it is, he should be talking about it only to his doctor first. It may also be other things like a personality disorder, which seems more likely considering he said it took him months to even care about his girlfriend.", "He can tell her. \"Hey, I'm not feeling so great lately. I'm going to go see the doctor this afternoon.\"\n\nNotice how that doesn't make it her responsibility?", "Go to therapy. Talk to a friend. Find a support group. \n\nIf you had a weird mole on your leg, would you also expect your partner to figure out what to do about it or would you handle it yourself?", "Fake it til you make it.", "You need some help, like real help from a therapist or support group and not a brand new mama. I know talking to people is hard and you're still young but you gotta do it. It's not fair to your gf that she has to be your everything. Maybe start small with like a dad group. There will be lots of other dads there, many who had the same issue. You can talk to them about it without your girlfriend feeling overwhelmed and like you're rejecting her and her new baby (that kid feels like a part of her)", "No sir. It's hard to be a parent at this age especially in todays time and without the support of your family. That shit is hard and lonely. You're a young parent, but you are an adult too. You can't act like a teenager anymore and 'keep stuff to myself' because you're feeling angry and vulnerable. That's not going to fix anything and it's not going to make you feel any better, so stop it. You're better than that and you know it. You deserve to be heard and get help, but you've gotta understand why everyone is saying you're the AH.\n\n To everyone calling you the AH,  it seems as if you are undermining what your girl went and is still going through because of childbirth by huffing and puffing about her not being able to mentally support or take on your load right now and for freaking out. No one is saying that how you're feeling isn't important (and to the people that are, ignore them) but they are not MORE important than what your girl is going through currently. I don't think you're an AH in general, but you're an AH for being mad at your girlfriend for not being able to help you right now (2 weeks post childbirth). I can't bash you too hard for going to her with your problem because like you said, she's the person you've always gone to, but in a relationship sometimes you gotta put your partner first, and this is one of those times. This does not mean ignoring your mental health or never speaking to her again about your issues, it means realizing that what your girl is going through 2 weeks post birth is objectively more mentally taxing then what you're currently going through 2 weeks post birth, and that you need to find other support systems (therapy, dad groups, Journaling, etc.) than just her.\n\nMen's mental health is important too. To me it just seems like you're concerned about being a good father and so you went to the person you usually go to with your problems for help, but she can't help you right now and you can't be mad at her for it or hold it against her or even take it personally. So what you gotta do now is take a breath, take the advice of the people on here (regarding finding alternative support). AITA is a brutal sub that won't hold back when you ask if you're the AH lol they go for the freaking jugular! Don't let it get to you, but don't let your emotions keep you from seeing why people might be calling you an AH (even if they are being an AH themselves with the way they are saying it lol).", "It\u2019s the equivalent of not thinking about how you\u2019re words would come across to others, and thinking it\u2019s okay just because how you feel at the time.", "A feeling is an opinion. You call someone something because you feel they are something. \n\nNo feelings are 100% that way forever with no chance of changing.", "Hi it\u2019s okay to feel that way just apologise to your girlfriend and spend more time with your son as he grows in the next month you will love him so much it\u2019s okay to not feel anything your girlfriend is upset because she has just given birth and will be extremely\nSensitive for the next 6 weeks so give it time", "Very true.", ">\"she's my only person\"\n\nYou need to change this immediately. This is not okay.\n\nGo to Church. Join a men's group. Make an appointment with a therapist. Bare minimum: do a free online chat with a crisis line. \n\nWhoever you choose to reach out to, make it someone who WON'T be drowned by it. Your girlfriend is already treading water in the ocean with you; don't lean on her to keep your head afloat, you'll just push her under. \n\nIt's good for partners to mutually support each other. It's bad when someone's only support is their partner. You need to find an external support system that helps you with things that it is not appropriate to ask your partner for (e.g. emotional reassurance when you disclose feelings of not loving your newborn; it is not appropriate to put that on the mother of the newborn immediately postpartum).", "As someone who was born to teen parents who just kept having kids after me, please use some form of birth control from here on out.", "You obviously had sex, could\u2019ve umm used condoms.

I had zero part of my comment saying if op was or wasn\u2019t the asshole, just letting some of you guys know that it happens to men too and it\u2019s FAR too often overlooked.", "y\u2019all would not say the same thing if a women was going through PPD or if she was saying what this man is saying", "So in your opinion it would be better to not be concerned, not share your concern with your partner and keep your feelings to yourself that you know are not normal? Or fake it and act like you have feeling when you really don't? I honestly think that being truthful is the way to go, and honestly it probably hurts his feelings as well that he feels this way and is being shunned for trying to talk about it. This is why men have a higher suicide rate etc.. not that I'm exactly pro men tbh most are trash however I can definitely sympathize with a new parent especially one with mental issues. It honestly seems psychopathic to me to hide these feelings and act normal. who else are you supposed to talk to besides your partner or the mother of your child? Someone paid to pretend to care?", "Okay", "There are probably new dad support subreddits or off my chest or anything. The internet has millions of online support groups", "I see that now im gonna keep everything to myself if it causes this much drama thank you.", "Do you know the current waiting period for therapists in my area? 13 months. So STFU and stop pretending therapy is readily available.\n\nETA: I take it back, OP won\u2019t seek therapy even if it was available. Apologies to the commenter I was rude at.", "You're being way out of line. If anything, you're the one lacking empathy here. \n\nOP just revealed that he is incredibly alone and lacking a support network. Telling his GF at this time was maybe not the best move, but it sounds like he was seeking advice because he cares enough about his family to want to fix it.\n\nAnd yelling at someone for not being able to immediately afford a therapist is really shitty. Also classist. You will be getting one downvote from me.", "You really want to lecture about lack of empathy with this comment?", "Terrible advice", "There is no universe where \u201cI feel nothing for our child\u201d is an offhand comment.", "Do you literally not get that it is threatening to her if he says this? It's not something she should handle right now. She needs to hear that all is well. Having a baby is not a casual event...", "I agree with you completely on this and I'm a woman and a feminist. It's common sense and compassionate to understand that men have needs too, in fact asking them to bottle them all up is what leads to the violence that these same ppl would also (rightly) decry.  Quite a lot of misandry on this thread.", "So I\u2019m gonna be open and communicative and tell you that from your comments it seems like you\u2019re also an asshole.", "If she was saying what this man is saying it would absolutely be \"go to the doctor\"?? That's the very first bit of advice anyone would go for??", "What? Yes I would. Any mental health concerns should be assessed and confirmed by a healthcare provider first, always. It doesn\u2019t matter what gender the person experiencing them is.", "Probably because no husband has just been ripped ass to taint to give birth.", "I would say the same thing to a female partner of a person who just gave birth.", "I agree, be truthful, but be truthful that you need to see a therapist.

So yep you right who knows what point they trying to make. You not feeling anything does not mean you have any ill will or bad thoughts about your new born, u can care and look after him. I really hope for you and your son those feelings come, you know how you feel about your first born so your capable of it and it sounds like you really want to feel that way for your new born.", "Because you're a grown ass man acting like you don't know how to take care of yourself.

No one is telling you to \u201ckeep it all to yourself,\u201d they\u2019re telling you that it\u2019s unfair to expect your postpartum wife to be your SOLE source of emotional and mental health support.", "YTA especially for all these comments. Your wife is the mother of 2 kids under 4 and one is a newborn. And you also want her to cater to your insecurities because you don't have a support system. You are an adult man. Build yourself a support system. That can include friends, family, casual buddies, therapy. But she can't be parenting 2 toddlers AND you. \nYou aren't the AH because you don't feel love towards your son yet. I'm sure that will come. And if you were feeling like you are a danger to yourself or your kids, of course you need to speak to your wife. But just because it's taking you a long time to feel love for your son, something that you are saying REGULARLY is something you experience for people--why would you put this on a newly postpartum mother of 2 babies? It's selfish.", "Keeping this to yourself will only make it worse. I know it\u2019s hard, but you need to find some kind of support system. This is exactly what my partner says who is autistic and depressed and it causes incredible strain on our relationship because I am their only and main support system. This is why we fight. You have to have other people and if you keep it to yourself, your partner can tell. Your partner knows you and can sense what\u2019s going on, don\u2019t play games with your feelings, that\u2019s how relationships get ruined.", "Thank you they think therapy is the answer to everything", "No one said to bottle up, but to talk to someone other than his partner who has just given birth", "Ffs, insisting he use a therapist to talk about this stuff is NOT misandrist. It\u2019s pragmatic AND the logical thing to do because *gasp* the world doesn\u2019t revolve around him and his ability to process emotions. He confided in not only the person closest to him but the MOST vulnerable as well. He needs to get his head out of his ass and act like a grown up because it\u2019s too late for this \u201cvirtually a child\u201d (your words) to not have babies. There is a time and place, and relying on his healing, postpartum wife to act as a therapist isn\u2019t just innocently ignorant- it\u2019s cruel AF.", "I'm sure that's not all he said. Yes that would be assholeish but still concerning. You're saying that's the same as calling someone ugly or stupid. Simply wrong. Maybe you don't deal with mental health issues but it's very difficult and I can only imagine how horrible it feels to feel a loss of connection with your own child. But for the sake of others, keep it all in!! Not a healthy relationship in my opinion, to keep something as serious as that to yourself. No matter if it hurts someone's feelings or not.", "I\u2019ll never ask her for advice again", "I understand that now", "Most likely gonna break up i tried to apologize to her and she said she hates me", "The comment above was harsh, but it told OP something he needs to hear (this this is something he should be dealing with in therapy).

Or are you being dismissive of that idea?", "Well for your post new kid depression therapy and medication is actually the recommended answer, dude. Sorry if it\u2019s not the answer you want, but you need to be evaluated by a psych, and get on meds and also probably seek out a therapist to talk about your lack of emotions to the child. Your gf doesn\u2019t need to be the only person you emotionally rely on.", "> therapy has nothing to do with that. I concluded that im just gonna keep everything to myself so it won\u2019t be any drama.\n\n\nSays him very conveniently *after* creating drama.\n\nHow are you going to take back what you told your wife? And what are you going to do when you still don\u2019t feel the great emotions for your son in next six months, or years?", "Actually if you struggle to feel anything for your child-therapy actually is the answer. You might want to start with why you feel that way.", "One of the main reasons for a therapist, is to have someone with whom to unload about difficult topics that would be ABSOLUTELY unfair and harmful to unload on vulnerable other relationships in your life. \n\nOP's girlfriend is postpartum with a newborn. She is NOT in a safe place to carry OP's emotional garbage. He needs to take that stuff to someone reasonably capable of carrying it in this moment, and if he doesn't have friends or family members capable of that, he needs to find a therapist. Heck, even a free crisis line (phone or chat) can be accessed anytime. \n\nIt's fair for OP to need support about his feeling of not loving his child. It's not fair for him to expect his recently postpartum gf to be the specific person who provides it. She is in an incredibly vulnerable situation right now and needs the other adults to be helping her feel safe and protected (and to feel that her children are safe and protected). It will NOT help her feel that she and her children are safe and protected, to hear that her children's father doesn't love their new baby.", "He has said in multiple other places on this thread that he doesn't have any support, families disowned them and his friends aren't about. He is not the AH he's 22 years old, virtually a child himself, and he is trying his best to hold his shit together with what sounds like quite possibly some form of depression, a struggling partner, and two kids. I've read his other comments and as someone who can smell an AH from six miles away I am telling you now, this lad is not one. This is what pisses me off about radfems. They destroy the cause for the rest of us. Men are damned if they do try, albeit clumsily, to process their emotions. And they're damned if they don't.", "And you're reacting like a petty little brat. That's the other reason why you're being downvoted.", "I wish you were my little brother because I'd have so much to say to you right now. First, take a deep breath. \nI think you need to give her some time. I don't think you realized it when you said it, but hearing that is absolutely overwhelming for a new Mom. She just gave birth. She is still recovering and all the exhaustion that comes with it. She has all sorts of new emotions and love for her new baby. And she's trying to raise a 3 year old. My kid is 15 now and I STILL remember how horrible I felt through her first few weeks. I can't even describe how physically and emotionally exhausting everything was. \nI think you need to think about it from her perspective. I think that, and finding yourself some sort of support system would be a good start for you.", "The message is lost because of the awful delivery. Just reading the guys other responses tells me he is open to solutions, when someone is asking for help you don't berate them and make them feel worse for asking for help.

I take back what I said to the other guy. YTA. \n\nThis is not a normal reaction\u2026.to the idea of therapy!!!\n\nYou created the drama because you decided your partner should be your emotional support, but NOW you want to keep it to yourself when asked if you have seemed therapy? \n\nYou are a massive immature AH.", "You need therapy. This is not a normal reaction", "Do not listen to these idiots.\nThey have no idea what they are talking about.\nYou absolutely do not need therapy or medication.\nWhat you are feeling is perfectly normal.\nWell done for engaging with your partner and talking to them about your feelings.\nThat\u2019s what mature adults do.\nGod these idiot redditors piss me off", "Uh, wait, back up- she slammed a door *on your fingers*?\n\nThat is... very not okay. She just tried to physically injure you on purpose.\n\nThat *should not be happening* in a healthy relationship, period.", "Bro, go and talk to a medical professional.\n\nHer behaviour is also terrible. You need to start learning acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. But also understand that her reaction Is extreme because she also doesn\u2019t know better. It\u2019s blind leading the blind.\n\nTry to understand, you\u2019re not an AH because how you feel. But your partner clearly doesn\u2019t understand that. You were an AH for dumping this on her. Go to someone who will help you with understanding your feelings.", "She probably needs time, and you should just keep trying to show up.  Keep trying to connect with your son, as it will show her that you are committed to the three of them, even as you work through your feelings.  \n\nOn a separate note, my guy, you can't depend on only one person to talk about your feelings.  It's not fair to either of you.  She's going through a lot right now, and in all those hormones and stress, you are asking her to help you process your own.  \n\nThis is why people are mentioning the therapist.  Not because there is anything wrong with you, but because you have been through a lot and deserve your own support system. You essentially lost your parents while you became one, and lost a bit of your support system because your friends can't help you process.    \n\nI would also offer that you ask at your local hospital (or search online) for local new parent groups.  You were still just kids when you had your first, and maybe didn't use that resource before, but consider it now.  You'll find a lot of new dads who will face things like this with you, and maybe you won't feel so alone."]}
