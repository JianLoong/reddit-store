This is a new human and you do not know each other, most of your energy is going to help andconcern for your wife and care for your daughter, who needs a lot of attention.

Treating someone as if you love them, even when they are annoying you, because of the commitment that you made. (Note: I\u2019m talking about \u201cnormal\u201d levels of annoyance, not abuse. That\u2019s a different conversation!)\n\nUnfortunately, as you have seen, new parents (both mums and dads) get a **ridiculous** amount of judgment if they don\u2019t fall in love with their baby immediately. \n\nYou will be fine. You have experienced that love with your daughter. It will come with your son. Just give it time. \n\nAnd reassure your wife, that you love her, and you choose to love both of your children - even if the \u201cwarm & fuzzies\u201d haven\u2019t kicked in yet for the new baby. \n\nIt is not perfect that your wife wasn\u2019t able to support you when you asked for her support. But that sometimes happens in couples - both people are struggling so they aren\u2019t in a place to help the other person as much as they maybe would at a different time. It doesn\u2019t make you an AH for asking for her support though. And she is not an AH because she cannot help you right now. \n\nYou are both new parents. \n\nIt\u2019s just kinda hard when a new baby arrives. \n\nKeep being kind to each other. And to yourselves.

It sounds like you were having painful internal thoughts and wanted your partner to help figure it out for you, without taking your own time to figure out your feelings.
