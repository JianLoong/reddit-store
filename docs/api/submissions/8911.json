He has a daughter my age. \n\nMy cousin and I both want to go to college in the US (we\u2019re international students from a developing country). I consistently get good grades, got into Stanford, and have life skills like being able to cook and clean that mean I\u2019d do well living in a foreign country. My cousin gets abysmal grades, the only college she got into so far was a college with an 80% acceptance rate that isn\u2019t highly ranked\u2014 and that too was after hiring somebody to write her essays for her, because she can\u2019t even speak or communicate in english fluently\u2014 and is generally naive and ill-equipped to survive moving to a new, unfamiliar country. \n\nAs far as I can tell, she just wants to go to America because it\u2019s a way to show off, not because she actually cares. \n\nAnyhow, I didn\u2019t get that good of financial aid from Stanford because I\u2019m an international. 4 years would cost the full sum of my uncle\u2019s college fund. My cousin didn\u2019t get much aid either, and hers costs about the same. \n\nI don\u2019t want to take on debt, so I convinced my uncle to spend the college fund entirely on me instead of her\u2014 first off, Stanford is much higher ranked than the college she got into, secondly I have a proven track record of doing well which makes it more likely I would do well and complete my degree. By contrast, she gets poor grades and can\u2019t even speak or read english fluently, it\u2019s evident that any money spent on her would be a waste. \n\nMy uncle agreed, and told his daughter she could either go into debt or go to a far cheaper college in our home country. This upset her, and she said that the only reason my uncle agreed to this is out of sexism making him not want his daughter not under his control. \n\nI mean, we live in a conservative country, so that certainly could play a part, but I pointed out that her failure to get into a college worth paying so much for and the fact she wouldn\u2019t do well if he let her go we\u2019re probably a reason. She called meTA. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You should post what 4 years at Stanford will cost you so everyone knows what a small fortune you\u2019ve taken for yourself.", "YTA for your arrogance in your comments, and for persuading your uncle to not fund his daughter's education.  She doesn't need to speak or write English fluently to succeed here.  Unis will help her with that, there are students like that every year at every university.  \n\nAnd newsflash, students at universities with 80% acceptance rates still have successful futures.  It's not a foregone conclusion that money spent on her would be a waste.\n\nConversely, neither is there a guarantee that you will be successful.    People do wash out of Stanford regularly.\n\nIf your cousin doesn't have a future now, it's because you stole it from her.", "You are arguing with everyone in the comments to prove over and over that you are right. Why post in AITA if you won\u2019t listen to people\u2019s comments? We can\u2019t force your uncle to split the fund evenly, all we can do is call it like we see it to you\u2026 the person who asked if they are an asshole.\n\nAnd everyone is concluding that you are!", "YTA - it isn't fair you take all the money and she goes fully into debt. The money should be split between the two of you and you both take on debt. If you're as resourceful and brilliant as you claim to be, you should be able to pay it off quickly.", "YTA here - your uncle can spend his money how he wants but its you actively trying to convince him that sets you apart here.", "Snotty, but NTA. Presumably his uncle is now in loco parentis for him and was, in a sense, making a decision about how to split a college fund between siblings. OP made an argument and the uncle agreed. \n\nI\u2019m idly wondering if she didn\u2019t have to take the TOEFL, but that\u2019s not relevant to my judgment.", "If you were considerate you would have taken half not all.

What's the bet that your responsibilities around the home for you compared to your cousin were very different.

Your cousin should do the same. It should be equal.", "YTA for convincing your uncle to spend money on you instead of his own daughter or splitting it equally between the two of you. It will surely damage the father/daughter relationship when she finds out about it.\n\nYou are using your country social bias towards males to your advantage. Getting a foreign education is not just the education from studies but also from being living independently, experiencing a different culture, and making friends/connections that are impossible without leaving the country.\n\nYou not wanting to incur debt is selfish and is robbing your cousin of experiencing studying abroad.", "YTA and I BET you will NOT be successful at the university.

If your grades are that good, then why not go to a lesser-ranked yet excellent school with a good scholarship? I\u2019m from a developing country and studied abroad with scholarships. Your attitude is piss poor and you won\u2019t get very far in college with that attitude. Academic success only matters so much, how you deal with those less privileged than you will determine how loved you are and the quality of your life. Before you cry about it being your hard work because you seem like the type, remember that it is a privilege to be a good student. You have no sympathy, empathy, or decency. You\u2019re arrogant and ignorant. I\u2019m surprised your cousin still talks to you because you sound insufferable as hell. I hope she does well in life and cuts you off as well as her father.", "info: did you not have any inheritance from your parents? or money saved from working?", "YTA\n\nThat was HER college fund. That\u2019s *HIS* daughter.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s Stanford or a local community college. The college fund was intended to support her go to college. She\u2019s gotten accepted into a college but now she has to go into debt or go back to her home country for school because her cousin who\u2019s been living with her for two years convinced her father that he was more worthy of the fund because he\u2019s going to Stanford.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t even matter about your grades vs hers, or who\u2019s better in English. It kind of makes you the asshole to even be comparing yourselves to try to rid yourself of any guilt you\u2019re feeling from taking the college fund. You should be supportive of her trying to further her education instead of shitting on her IMO.\n\nEdit* - why ask \u201cAITA\u201d if you\u2019re going to argue hard with everyone who doesn\u2019t give you the answer you\u2019d hope for? seems a lot are trying to give you a YTA perspective and you refuse to hear it because you\u2019re getting your tuition covered at an Ivy League school lmao.", "YTA. You have a toxic view of perceived prestige and importance of school. Unless you\u2019re going into finance or a very specific field then top ranked schools don\u2019t mean dick and you\u2019re going to have a mediocre career with a more expensive piece of paper like most other graduates. You have a lot of snide remarks about the school she\u2019s getting into and it says a lot about you. \n\nYou also seem to have a very toxic dynamic with her based on your self perception of your own importance. You are only 17 and think you have it figured out like most people, but at that age you know nothing. It\u2019s good to be driven in life, but it\u2019s not good to think you are better than others. If you continue then it\u2019s inevitable you will be taken down off your high horse at some point.", "YTA you suck op I hope they go no contact with your ass", "You and your uncle are TAs.  .\n\nYour responses are passing judgment beyond what you already have said.  And you are judging her hard.  Everything I read tells me you see yourself as entitled, and I suspect your uncle is generally at fault for this.  Most likely because you lost your parents.  You have no idea what might come. Yet You are stating she has no future. You have no way of knowing this.  My guess is that she is hindered by the environment she is in.  America represents opertunity, and you took that away.  \n\nYou both should have debt or work while at school to avoid it.  Neither of you should benefit off the other, that is just selfish.  More importantly, your own capabilities should grant you a leg up and deliver more than her, so having to work for it shouldn't be hard for you.  \n\nJust to be clear, YTA", "YTA\n\n\u201dI decided in my teenage wisdom to throw away my cousins chance because I\u2019m better.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA decent person would NOT let your uncle rob her future to buy yours. Split the fund is more than generous to you, and you have the higher potential to pay back a loan.", "NTA but your uncle is. I tried to manipulate everything in my favor as a teen as well TBH. I grew up and matured and definitely understand now that winning for everyone is the way to approach life but at the end of the day, you\u2019re playing to your maturity level at the moment.", "NTA you have an amazing opportunity and will not squander it. Take the money and go to Stanford. Don\u2019t listen to these fools.", "\"I don\u2019t want to take on debt, so I convinced my uncle to spend the college fund entirely on me instead of her\"  \n\n\nEeeesh.  YTA.

Your uncle is not quite as bad, but you caused him to be an AH with you. YTA", "YTA, a 50/50 split is only fair", "I think your age is really showing in these comments. You have this idea that your entire life is decided by the time you are 17, and in doing so robbed your cousin of any chance at a different or better one. You were selfish and manipulative and you can use the excuse that the adults agreed with you, but don\u2019t you see that\u2019s part of the issue? This wasn\u2019t your decision to make, but you forced your way in and convinced your uncle that his daughter is not worth a shot at a future because you are more worthy. Who are you to decide? \n\nYTA.", "NTA. It's evident that the girl will waste the money if she can't even communicate in English, how can she survive in the US? Additionally, OP said that English is taught in their institutions starting at age 5, indicating that she simply didn't want to learn. The girl only wants to brag when she visits the US, according to OP. It is her father's money and he has the authority to chose whom to give it to, he gave it to a much brighter child with a better future.", "Your definitely TA!! Way to ruin your cousins future for your own personal gain. Nothing good ever comes from actions like yours. I only wish I could see when karma catches up with you lol.", "YTA... sorry, but yes. It was so generous of your uncle to give you ANY of the funds he likely only ever planned on only giving to his own child. You should never have asked for more than what he planned to give you.", "YTA. To an incredible, selfish beyond words, ruin-your-cousin's-life-and-justify-it-to-yourself degree. And your uncle too for listening to you. Good grief.", "YTA.. it should have been split 50/50.. if she fails, she fails, but she should have been allowed the opportunity. \n\nSeriously, would your parents be proud of this behavior?", "YTA - majorly. You robbed her of a future because your selfish. I\u2019d also like to point out, your cousin hasn\u2019t thrived in a \u201cconservative country\u201d. Did you ever think it could be an environmental thing? You\u2019re easily the biggest asshole on here today and so is your uncle. \n\nYou should be grateful to get even half, but that isn\u2019t good enough.", "Maybe she would have done better had you not come to live with them. Her life changed too.", "YTA majorly. I\u2019m not gonna say why cause all the other comments are doing a great job at explaining why. I just wanted to say why are you asking if you\u2019re the asshole if you\u2019re arguing with everyone who isn\u2019t telling you what you want to hear ? Get a life.", "Question is there an agreement where you pay them back?", "YTA. That\u2019s a false dichotomy. It\u2019s not that either you *steal* all the money and sacrifice her future for yours or leave it and make her suffer by letting her travel, assuming all what you said about her is true\u2014 which I don\u2019t think is. I also don\u2019t get why you feel so entitled of saying that and even considering her traveling there and seeking a better life, which is *just* what you want as well, a way of showing off. Not to mention the fact that such schools with +70% acceptance rates exist for a reason; her \u201cbad grades\u201d, as you put it, were good enough for them and they accordingly accepted her. It\u2019s not up to you to decide whether she should go or not. YTA again.", "NTA It\u2019s his money until he spends it. Just because it was saved originally for her doesn\u2019t make it hers.

I can't give you a pass on this one, hearing your justifications for this made my skin crawl. \n\nIt's your uncle's money and he can do what he wants with it, but if I was your cousin I'd stay away from you for the rest of my life.", "YTA.

She won't do well at a college in America.\n\nHer dad started that fund for her, long before your parents died. It was always meant for her.
