Or a double date so the socializing is set up easily for her since she\u2019s a bit more introverted?\n\nBtw, you\u2019re still TA.", "I already thought YTA, but after reading some of your comments, my judgement is reinforced with concrete and steel beams. \n\nYou are not an equal partner to your wife. She is a SAHM so you are complacent and let the majority of childcare and household management duties fall on her. \n\nYou refuse to be an equal partner when things pile up to be too much for her to handle on her own\u2026 you\u2019d rather hire help or recruit family than step up and be an equal partner/parent. Maybe she doesn\u2019t want to rely on other people? Maybe she feels it\u2019s a burden to them. Maybe she feels it\u2019s a burden to you. Maybe she doesn\u2019t trust that things will be handled without her to do them. There\u2019s usually a reason for those feelings.\n\nYou judge her for wanting to stay home and relax and nap instead of going out and socializing like you do. Have you ever considered that maybe she is an introvert and needs alone time to recharge her batteries, whereas you are clearly an extrovert who recharges with socializing. Or maybe, she is so burnt out from carrying the mental load of all the home and childcare tasks and running around like mad getting your kids to all their activities, that she has zero energy left to go and be social? Or maybe it\u2019s a mix of both. \n\nYou also judge her and complain about how *you* are far more interesting to talk to than she is because *you* go out and do fun things and all *she* cares about is family and house stuff. Yawn, boring. Right? Maybe because that\u2019s all she has time for. Also, why doesn\u2019t your family interest you? Don\u2019t you want to know about them? \n\nHave you ever considered the fact that women often lose themselves in motherhood because society tells us that is where our inherent value lies, and it\u2019s the number one thing we should want, and we should just naturally be good at it, and we should love every single minute of it, even the hard stuff. And it\u2019s so much work, especially when we have partners who don\u2019t pull their weight, that it utilizes all our mental capacity and we are completely consumed by it? \n\nInstead of complaining that she isn\u2019t how you want her to be and then shaming her and blaming her for it (like that somehow is going to help the situation), maybe sit down and talk to your wife about how she is feeling about it all. Ask her what you can do to help her. How would she feel more supported. You want her to be able to do things that bring her joy? Maybe that\u2019s a nap! Or maybe she needs you to consistently show up for her so that she feels safe and secure enough to relax, recharge and get back to herself. Instead of making her feel bad, find solutions that would make her feel better.\n\nEdited to add: you have *seven kids* aged 3 months to 15 yes old and you are gone *two nights per week*?!? Man this story just keeps getting better.", "You're leaving out one very critical part of the story: the part where SHE complains about having no friends. \n\nClearly, your life outside your family is important to you, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that (assuming you're carrying your share of the load at home), but why does it have to be important to her? It's entirely possible she's completely fulfilled with being a \"supermom\" and the reason she doesn't have friends is because she plain doesn't want them. \n\nAgain, you told this story from your perspective only, so it's hard to tell, but it sounds to me like you're the one who has a problem with it, not her. And if that's the case, that means you have an inability to identify with people who have different priorities. \n\nShe doesn't like the same things you do, and it drives you insane because you can't understand why. That's narcissism. \n\nIf you reply that she bitches and moans about not having friends, that changes things a bit. If you reply that you do your share at home so she even has time to network like you do, that changes things a bit. Otherwise, YTA for imposing your standards on her, and using them to judge her while simultaneously creating a situation where she couldn't if she wanted to.", "INFO: Does she want to have friends and a social life? Because from your post I get that she's content with her life. If this is her choice (and she has the opportunity to be as social as you, should she want to be), and she doesn't complain about her lack of friends, then you are an asshole for the unwarranted judgment and unsolicited advice.\n\nHonestly, this sounds more like it bothers YOU that all she has to say is about the kids and being a mother. I don't think this is about driving other people away or putting other peope off. This is about you. You're put off by her personality now. You're driving yourself away from her because you find her topics of conversation boring or repetitive.\n\nIf that's the case, then talk with her about it from an honest and considerate place, see about maybe get some counseling to find ways to enjoy your time together without talking only about the kids, and without you trying to force your lifestyle on her.\n\nPointing fingers at her and telling her nobody likes her because she's only a mom, isn't going to get you anywhere good.\n\nEDIT: OP hasn't replied to me yet but I read in another comment that they have a 3-month old and he does the bare minimum in terms of caring for the child. That makes this even more a Y T A case but I'm still waiting to know whether she ever expresses that she'd want friends and a social life.", "YTA. These aren't \"excuses,\" they're responsibilities and part of being a parent. Have you tried helping by lightening the load for her? Maybe offer to take over for a few nights so she actually has time to do all the things that you do? You can't just pick and choose when to be a parent. Also, have you asked her if that's what she wants? Some people are introverts and prefer to stay in instead of interacting with people. Not everyone wants to make friends, a lot of people are happy by themselves. My mother was this way and she perfered to just take care of me and not have more than 1 or 2 friends that she barely even talked to. That's how she was happy.", "So let's see.

You can make time for all of these things because your wife is a SAHM of 7 children including an infant. She is the household manager. It is more than a full time job and you just invalidated her existence. No wonder she can't think about anything else- she doesn't have time. Offering to have a babysitter every once in a while does, in no way, reduce her mental load. She can't relax for a few hours because she knows just how much work there is waiting for her after her 'break'. If you wanted to make it even remotely equal you would take responsibility, entirely, for certain days or activities. Child A needs to be at karate at 6pm on Tuesday, child B needs to be at ballet at 6:30 etc then that's your job- no excuses. You make dinner, every night. She gets Sundays off, no children or housework at all and YOU take care of it all.

It's for belittling her.  \n\n\nIt's EXTREMELY reasonable to want your wife to have the same type of balance you see yourself having. But (based solely on whats written here and in comments) that balance is given to you because of her involvement with the kids. Because she does more as a parent than you do (or maybe more than you can?). Stay at home parents always have an advantage that way.   \n\n\nI want to tell you your not involved enough and that she's doing everything but realistically, I can't say that from the text. I'll tell you that as someone else who's been married almost as long, it's really important that when you approach this conversation with her again (and you will), you don't be a condescending asshole about it. Telling her \"that's why you have no friends\" is a massive dick move. That was just rude.   \n\n\nEverybody wants something different in life. For ten years, we were told we would never have children but having kids is the only thing my wife ever wanted. To be a mom. To be THE mom. And now that we were able to have a kid, she is SO involved and does everything. All the events, all the groups, all the \"I'm a mom\" personality stuff that you talk about here. But she doesn't see her burnout or recognize when she's not getting enough help. I have to step in and just \"take\" our kid so she gets a break. We go do something fun. We fly kites or walk the property or read books. When we come home, I find my wife happier than normal. She's had time to decompress. To get away without being asked if she needs to.   \n\n\nAll that being said, it sounds like you've got an incredible wife and a very rewarding social life. Just try to be more gentle in your approach. Nobody wants to be told they're fucking up. It's a lot better for everyone to just step in, give help without asking and make the effort to give her \"time off.\" Even if she doesn't see that as a break, she'll appreciate it in the long run. She may even have some time to consider all the things you've talked about and what she wants from life once the kids are grown and out of the house.", "NTA - I think maybe you chose the wrong way to tell her she should make time for herself and her own happiness.

I was not in a position where I could risk losing another job. I offered to have my mom come over to help but my wife refused as my mom makes her feel anxious and like a failure. Granted, my mom expects everyone's home to look like a picture out of a model home catalog and nothing ever out of place.", "And 6 other children", "I took a week off when the baby was born for her to rest as much as possible. Again, the baby is exclusively breastfed, he refuses a bottle, but when I'm home we split diaper changes and bath fairly evenly. She does the bedtime routine.", "He loves to claim that everything that is a problem or a hindrance is because of the choices she makes. Not because of circumstance or basic biology and definitely not because he has left her with no real choice and no real options. He\u2019s so blameless he probably sees a halo when he looks in the mirror.", "Or take the baby with her? It's much easier to care for a newborn than newborn plus 6 other kids who have a variety of needs at different times.  \n\nShe could have a nice weekend away bonding with baby and let hubby care for everyone else. \n\nOr if she's catching up with someone being just the baby? Or time it between feeds? Sounds like hubby is using it as an excuse to give up on parenting duties", "If they are your kids and not just hers, why are you not doing more? Why are you leaving her at home multiple nights a week and at least one weekend a month. \n\nIf she left for a weekend every month, how would you run the household?

I bet you would be much happier without her. You literally say nothing but horrible things about  her. By your words it literally seems like no one likes her.

Surely that wouldn\u2019t boost her mental health this is extremely contradictory to what you said in your post.", "I wonder how dealing with you impacts her mental health because it sounds like she\u2019s taking care of an adult child who is more worried about going out and having fun himself instead of investing time into his family. \n\nYou take yourself on a trip every month, 12 trips a year. How often do you take your family on vacation? Once a month??", "My dude if you're THAT worried, cut back on your own socialising and give the time to your wife to go away for the weekend without 7 kids attached to her.\n\nOr two nights a week to take a wine and paint evening or whatever she's into.\n\nIf she does socialise but you're doing your own thing, who cares for your SEVEN kids?? \n\nWhen she's away does anything in the house get done or would she have to come home to 20 loads of laundry and an empty fridge? Then it's just not worth going away to come back to piles of work.", "You don't sound very interesting. \n\nSelf-centred, selfish men who fail at doing the bare minimum as a husband and father are rather common and boring.\n\nImagine having 7 kids and finding fault in your wife (are there 1 or 2 in nappies right now?) for actually being focused on their care rather than her social life.", "How often are *you* in charge of the kids?", "your wife refuses to make your children responsible for doing your job? good for her", "So you are on top of things, suggesting to parentify your teen children, so you still can deflect from your parental responsibility and your wife can get somewhat of a break?\n\nJesus Christ, this has to be fake. I really hope it is.", "and that\u2019s an issue in and of itself. other kids should not be parenting their younger siblings. it\u2019s shocking how common this is but it\u2019s actually a form of abuse. kids don\u2019t need to be parenting other kids. absolutely DO NOT put a 13 or 15 year old in charge. do it yourself??", "Why can\u2019t YOU help your wife then? Since you have so much free time on your hands", "No it's called being a selfish asshole because you only get to have the time to have this life because your wife sacrificies herself everyday.\n\nIf she were to do like you, Who would look after the kids while you go and have your playdates ? Who would cook your meals ? Do your laundry ? Make sure your kids do well at school ? \n\nYou're not the great guy you think you are. You're \u00e0 shitty father and a shitty husband.", "But don\u2019t you need her running the household so that you are able to execute efficient time management?", "Do you even like her?", "One might say that adult parents priorities the needs of their family before their own needs. You know, as long as the children are still dependent.", "Maybe help your fucking WIFE make time to have a day to herself! When\u2019s the last time she had a self care day?

When\u2019s the last time you took her out on the weekends? You\u2019re noticing she doesn\u2019t have a social life? Become her best friend!

That explains needing to be out of the house one day a week. But you\u2019re gone almost half the month including a monthly weekend getaway knowing your wife had major surgery. You really shouldn\u2019t be offering your mother up for help. You should be at home working along side her so she can have some trust in your parenting and home care abilities. I don\u2019t think she sees you manage the home enough and I suspect she is extremely mentally and emotionally fragile right now while trying to recover physically. MAJOR ASSUMPTION: I think your wife is busying herself to keep it together. If she can\u2019t be away from the three month old, maybe find something she can do with just her and the 3 month old. Or you can get a babysitter for the older kids and take her and the 3 month old out and you watch the baby while she relaxes until the baby needs to eat. I don\u2019t know.
