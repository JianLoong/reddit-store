Why would I not bundle him up?\u201d He said that I\u2019m a first time mom and he just wanted to be sure. Mind you, I\u2019ve worked with kids in the past and I have plenty of little cousins and a niece and nephew. I\u2019m not unfamiliar with babies.

I said, \u201cno, I\u2019m just not an idiot.\u201d Dinner was a little awkward at first but we moved past it kind of quickly and had a relatively good night.

I said, \"You mean these trousers, the trousers that she was wearing when we left the house, the trousers that came off when I pulled her out of the buggy?\" He looked really embarrassed and started apologising, I told him that as much as I appreciate him looking out for my kids, there was absolutely no excuse for him to go off on me like that, and that all he had to do was ask. \n\nIt never happened again.

Although I did say this laughing AND my father shares my sense of humor 100%, he also agreed with my assessment.  IMO, your father needs to lighten up a bit.  Yeah, as parents though, sometimes we feel the need to constantly remind others of even the obvious.

You then retorted the exact same way most people would, including myself, with smart quip and ribbed your dad. Then he took it personally rather than sharing in the joke. Understand that your dad is coming from a good place and is only looking out for you all. And as he has known you for 23 years, he probably knows you can be a dumb ass sometimes as well and is just double checking!\n\nEdit for context: I can relate to this whole thing as it is pretty much my dynamic with my dad.

It would be the same thing when people tell other people to drive safe. Your reaction would have been 'oh, so you think I am a bad driver', and 'I've driven a car for x amounts of years, of course I can drive safe'. Your parents said it to be kind. It had nothing to do with your parenting or intelligence.", "Soft YTA. \n\nApparently, while you know how to act with children, you can't handle old people.

Your dad is going to do his dad stuff, as it makes him feel useful.   He is in the habit of 'babying' you, as you will always be his baby, even when you are much older.   That is just how parenting works.   (In 20+ years, you will probably have a similar conversation with your own child.)\n\nYou are still fighting to feel independent (as you are still rather young), so you want to show him that you already knew stuff.  Just find a nicer way to assert your independence.  You don't have to hit him over the head with it.", "ESH\n\nYou gave a smart ass answer to his concern.

We\u2019ve never really been the closest and he really came into my life heavier when my son was born.

He needs constant reassurance that I'm not in imminent danger (running out of gas = left on the side of a highway and will d1e). He has no confidence in my ability to survive in the world, despite all evidence to the contrary. I'm 40 years old, have been married for almost 17 of those and have two daughters that we have raised without major drama. He can't control his emotions, and has incredible anxiety about everything, and expects everyone to buy into his unreasonable fear that something terrible is about to happen to any one of us. My dad needs a psychologist and intensive therapy and has for many years, but that's unlikely to happen. \n\nSo, I would answer OPs dad in the same way, because to me it sounds like he was unreasonably anxious when he didn't need to be, and he needed to be informed that it was ridiculous. I would use humour to soften it, because my psychologist has recommended that's appropriate in most situations. We do this often.", "Love this response. Thank you \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc", "Honestly, I think we\u2019re all assholes to an extent here tbh. I just wanted some other opinions.", "Nah, OP. Your dad openly insulted you. You're right to be upset.\n\nThis is literally on the level of your dad asking if you remembered to feed your kid.\n\nThe gas tank/bills that the other commenter presented are more \"can I help my kid/support them financially\" and have a completely different subtext. They don't insinuate an incapability to parent. Those concerns are just valid concerns in the face of a rapidly worsening global economy.", "But when they give those opinions, you're arguing with them. You don't want our opinions.
