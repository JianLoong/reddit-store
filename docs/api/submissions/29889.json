I'm the only girl in my family and planning my wedding was a nightmare because of my other who had to run the show. With 40+ years of hindsight I understand: she wanted the Cinderella wedding and instead had to settle for a civil ceremony without even a reception. So I was getting what she always wanted. Fast forward. I have four sons. All of them married women who were the first in their family to marry. The couples did most of the planning (and paying as far as I know, I was asked to contribute something like paying the DJ or the drinks etc which I gladly did). But when the last one got married, I begged my fdil and her mom to just let me go along on the planning. I'd keep my mouth shut unless it was to praise effusively. I just wanted to be included. I hadn't gotten to plan my own wedding and this certainly couldn't take the place of that, but I so wanted to be a part of my sons, more so than just writing out a check. Is it possible your fmil is in a similar position but just doesn't have the social skill to voice her opinion diplomatically? i could just imagine my mother in a situation like yours. She always said exactly what was on her mind, damn the consequences, because after all it was just her opinion. I believe she truly had no idea how hurtful and alienating her comments and actions were.  \n\n\nIt occurs to me as to many of the other commenters, there may be an element of racism here. Fmil may not even be aware of it. consider her background. Is she from an area where she has routinely interacted with people of diverse backgrounds? Or like my mother, a rural community where the only real diversity is how long your family's owned its land? Does she understand the significance of all of the elements that you are planning to include in your wedding? Maybe instead of a firm talking to, a heart to heart might work better? We all need to try hard to understand where others are coming from, especially in today's climate of knee jerk \"how dare you oppose my opinion\" reactions.\n\nIMHO, this should be worked out ASAP. it's not going to be any better when/if kids come along.
