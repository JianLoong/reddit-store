We have been friends for almost a decade and have lived together a few times over the years and when I bought my place she asked to move in. It was a good deal, she gets to save to buy by paying reduced rent and I get some help with the mortgage. \n\nMy friend is also from a super religious family but does not follow a lot of her families beliefs now (premarital sex, drinking etc) her parents have accepted this but ask that she keeps that part of her life hidden. The problems started when my friend found out she was pregnant from a ONS and decided to keep the baby. \n\nHer parents disowned her and she was heartbroken, but not surprised. I told her that I was ok with her continuing to pay rent here and live with me for as long as she needs and she gave birth to her baby boy A 6 months ago. \n\nAround 2 months ago her parents got back in touch and told her they\u2019d like to see her. She has lots of much younger siblings who she helped raise so she was super excited to go and see them, but they asked her not to take the baby as they don\u2019t want to be involved with him. \n\nI offered to look after A while she saw her siblings, thinking it would be a one time deal. Now she visits them almost every weekend and sometimes during the week (often staying the night) while I look after A. \n\nI didn\u2019t mind too much to begin with (he\u2019s a very good baby and I love hanging out with him) but A got sick last weekend just before she left to stay at her parents house for the night and after his temperature got super high I took him to the hospital. It took her SIX hours to answer her phone and she still didn\u2019t come to the hospital for another three (her parents live an hour away). \n\nI felt so powerless when A was sick, because I\u2019m not his mum or guardian and the hospital had regulations about how much I could do for and be with him and although he\u2019s better now, I\u2019m worried about looking after him again. \n\nShe asked me to take care of him again this weekend and I lost it, I explained that she had really put me in a horrible position while he was ill and if she doesn\u2019t give me some sort of guardianship/medical rights over him I won\u2019t be watching him again. \n\nShe cried and said I\u2019m holding her hostage now by giving her an ultimatum that means she can\u2019t see her parents if she doesn\u2019t agree to give me rights to her son and now I feel like I may be TA.", "created_utc": 1668111240, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrqixv/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_needs_to_give_me/", "score": 1539, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Okay first of all NTA. Not even close.\n\nSecond of all, if she doesn\u2019t see how dangerous this situation could have been for her SON, that\u2019s a problem. It\u2019s great she\u2019s trying to re-connect with her family, but she\u2019s a mother now and she can\u2019t just leave her kid every weekend to hang out with people who want to pretend he doesn\u2019t exist. That isn\u2019t healthy, and it\u2019s bordering on abuse / neglect. The only reason I say bordering is because thankfully she has you there to take care of this baby.\n\nThere is a fairly easy process to grant someone medical proxy in most states. She wouldn\u2019t be giving up her rights to her son in any way, she\u2019s just allowing you to make medical decisions in the even there is another emergency and she TAKES 6 HOURS TO REPLY. I cannot, under any circumstances, imagine a scenario where I am still breathing and it takes me that long to check my phone when one of my kids is with a babysitter.", "NTA. Honestly, I think you\u2019re focusing on the entirely wrong thing here.  Your friend found out her baby was in the hospital and did not care. Does that sound healthy to you? Is that the kind of person you want to live with?\n\nYou *really* need to ask yourself exactly how involved you want to be here. Because your friend sounds like a horrible parent and you taking care of this baby is wallpapering over that.\n\nDo you imagine yourself \u201dbabysitting\u201d this kid every weekend six years from now? Ten?", "NTA. A simple medical consent form would be easy to do and there\u2019s also things like limited power of attorney. As a p/t babysitter a medical consent form is probably the best fit.", "NTA\n\nYou need a medical consent form which allows you to seek treatment while you are supervising the child, since it sounds like you're watching this child overnight. These are fairly simple and often common (they're often in the massive stack of paperwork you have to sign to enroll your kid in daycare or summer camp, for example). \n\nYour friend's pediatrician should have a template copy that they accept or be able to refer you to where to get one.", "Nta - you seem a lot more concerned by the baby safety than her, which is scary - six hours before answering ??? three hours to come back ? If the situation happens again, hospital will call CPS against her... Be carefull, she should be bonding with her baby not dropping him any chance she gets... You're sure she goes in her family ??", "NTA\n\nYour friend is more worried about their relationship than HER OWN BABY that she\u2019s okay with leaving it with you for multiple days. She sounds like a terrible mother and is allowing her family to pressure her. She needs to cut them out. They don\u2019t even want to see her child and would rather she hide her baby\u2019s EXISTENCE? She sucks for allowing herself to be manipulated by her family and her family is majorly toxic.", "NTA. But not really sure having legal parental/guardian rights are needed. Not sure what country your in but if you take a baby to a medical professional they're going to help/treat it regardless of who brings it in. Worst case, they might raise a safeguarding concern but that's your friends problem, not yours. \n\nMore importantly, do you really want to be a surrogate mum to this kid, because it sounds like it's going to keep happen\n\nMore, more importantly why don't her parents want to see their grandkid and why is she abandoning her kid to see them? I know, super religious, but still are they going to ignore this kid its whole life?", "Nta. You need some sort of paper that says you can seek medical treatment cause its clear she wont come running if baby needs help. You are in a really weird situation and im sorry for it.", "NTA\nShe is totally the AH, who can she agree to see her  \u201cfamily\u201d without her boy, that is just plain sad. She is 30 , she need to be responsible for her son not you, plus she is the legal guardian not you in an emergency she is the only one who can make decision. I hope she finally fight for her son with her family now that you ask her to make you a legal guardian.", "NTA - I was curious to see where this was going. I guess you kind of have a point though. She cannot regularly leave the baby with you for long periods of time and be that unreachable without making sure you at least have the right to get the baby medical care when he needs it. I am sure there are simple forms you could both sign that would give you medical power of attorney in her absence without actually giving you custody/parental rights. \n\nBut I think there are much larger issues at play here. Obviously she is in a very emotionally vulnerable state given the stress surrounding her pregnancy and being disowned by her family. Her behavior seems a bit off. Has she been evaluated for PPD? Did she visit her parents this much before the baby? Are you sure her parents know that she kept the baby? It sounds like maybe she told them she put it up for adoption to get back in their good graces. Even if they don't want to see the baby, they must wonder where it is while she is with them.", "NTA. The baby should come first for her. The biggest issue is why isn\u2019t it?", "NTA, from the title I thought you wanted her to give up the baby entirely, but making sure you can make medical decisions if need be makes perfect sense if he's in your care that often.", "your roommate needs to realize she's a mom now. she can't play mom when it's convenient to her and she has to stop putting her parents and herself above her child.\n\ni understand she wants a relationship with her parents but why at the cost of her son's wellbeing?\n\nyou, however, are in no position to demand any rights to this child. babysit him or don't, but at the end of the day you are only that - a babysitter.\n\nESH because you both are handling this situation in the worst way possible.\n\ntell her to pull her head out of her ass and build healthy boundaries with her parents because she's neglecting her son for them", "NTA, but your friend sure is. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have to give you guardianship, but she needs to sign something that says you have all right to make magical decisions for the baby if/ when she cannot be contacted. \nI\u2019d probably get it notarized while I\u2019m at it. \n\nSo there\u2019s that, now as far as holding her hostage?  Oh no, she\u2019s got that backwards. \n\nLet\u2019s look at this - her parents want nothing to do with her when she gets pregnant, then they say, yeah come back into the fold- but without the baby. \n\nSo your friend is just having it all isn\u2019t she?  She gets to dump ( yes, I say dump, because that\u2019s exactly what she\u2019s doing) the baby on you whenever she feels like going home. \n\nAnd then when she\u2019s good and ready to come back she resumes care of HER CHILD. \n\nYou are a saint for agreeing to any of this. \n\nShe needs to decide, is she a mother to the child who she decided to keep full well knowing how her parents would react, or is she going to pretend he doesn\u2019t exist to make her parents happy? \nThis baby isn\u2019t going to disappear, you will be watching this boy for years to come because if her parents don\u2019t accept him now what makes you think that will ever change. \n\nAre you ok with that?", "ESH. The needs of the baby come first, stop providing her an out where she can pretend that she didn't have the baby to get back in the good graces of her rotten whacko parents. She either takes the baby with her to her parents or she doesn't go, those are the only two options. You taking over as part-time mom is off the table.", "NTA. Your friend is not being the mother she needs to be for that child. My niece gave birth about 2 months ago, and I live with her. No way in hell would she be leaving that child with me for multiple nights every week, even 4 months from now. In most states she can sign a paper giving you permission to make medical decisions. If my mom takes my kids on a trip, I'll give her one in case there's an emergency. You can find a template online. But that's not the solution to this problem. The solution is your friend taking full responsibility for her child.", "NTA, . . . But, Erm . . . Are we sure she is really seeing her parents this much? She chose them over her child? Or is she out doing other things. Because really . . . 6 hours? Then another 3 to get to a hospital? Nah.", "NTA, this is co-parenting, and you can't safely co-parent in a situation like that.", "NTA, her parents are the ones putting her in this situation.  If she's going to choose her parents over her own baby then she should give him up for adoption.   \n\nAnd what you are asking for is not phrased correctly, unless you ARE asking to adopt him.  You need some kind of guardianship papers at the most, but honestly the mom should just contact the hospital/doctors to sign a release letting you care for the child in her absence", "Nta. Ask the hospital what you need. It maybe as simple as a power of attorney for medical needs, which is easy to do.", "NTA. You are not holding your friend hostage, she us using you. She can find someone else to sit her baby.  You should probably back as far away as possible from this situation b/c your \"friend\" is only going to demand more and more from you. She needs to take care of her kid.", "NTA", "NTA and in most states it is super easy to sign a medical power of attorney. My husband and I did it for my mom when she watched our kids when we went on vacation. They have a plethora of forms you can use online for free. Additionally when filling out the MPOA she can elect to have it only effective until a certain date (i.e. when she gets back). It's really just the smart thing to do if you are going to be away from your child and not reachable. In no way would she be giving you 'legal rights' over her child, but just empowering you to ensure his safety while she is gone.", "NTA but I think you don't know what the problem really is.\n\nShe is the mother, she is abusing you and neglecting her own child.\n\nYou should analyze things better. You yourself are accepting responsibilities that do not correspond to you and that in the long run she will not value.", "You don\u2019t need any rights. She needs to sign a medical consent form. This allows you to give permission for the child to be treated by physicians and for physicians to provide you with  access to the child\u2019s medical information. Also, your friends parents are the ones \u201cholding her hostage\u201d. *They* put her in a shitty position where she isnt allowed to bring her baby around them, not you. It\u2019s irresponsible of her as a parent to prioritize frequent family visits over being with her baby. If anything, she\u2019s is holding *you* hostage as a babysitter by asking so frequently (most weekends) and staying out on her visits for long periods of time (not just an hour or 2, and regularly overnight). She is seriously overstepping and taking advantage of your kindness. Yes you love the child, but based on this post, I get the sense you feel like you can\u2019t say no when she asks, or would feel extremely guilty doing so. I\u2019m happy you put your foot down and told her what your ground rules are for watching the child in the future. NTA. EDIT: Spelling", "NTA!! This sounds like some \u201cFlowers in the Attic\u201d nonsense", "You sure she's actually visiting family and not a man?\n\nEither way she's taking advantage of you and you have to put an end to it.", "No way are you the ahole.  She is taking gross advantage of you.  At a minimum you need some sort of authority to make decisions for the child.  And you need to set up firm boundaries about how often you are willing to do the work of parenting this kid.\n\nYou are putting yourself at risk too if anything happens to him.  She's irresponsible and untrustworthy.  I could see her suing you.  You should find out what your liability could be.\n\nNTA.  Next time she abandons her kid without your permission, call the cops.", "NTA\n\nAre you sure she is with her relatives and not out partying? Most parents bring their child when they visit parents and siblings. That, with the fact that she was unreachable for so many hours. It just doesn\u2019t make sense with the story she is selling.", "Nta. She is not a fit mother. Call social services. Who doesn\u2019t care that their child is in hospital? Who gladly leaves their child at home and is so desperate to meet up with family that don\u2019t want him? She is not a good mother. She\u2019s not even a good person", "I love when titles make me think y.ta when the actual situation is complete NTA.\n\nYou're not asking for sole rights to him, just enough to be able to make medical decisions for him when she is too busy to bother caring for her child. You're putting him first.  She's putting herself first\n\nDon't feel bad about this ONE BIT. You've done nothing wrong and everything right", "NTA\n\nHolding her hostage? No honey you had a kid.

The second the parent is unavailable when something goes wrong, I would never watch that kid again. NTA stop letting her take advantage of you.

It gives you the legal ability to make medical decisions but does not give you custody or parental rights over the child.\n\n\"When Is a Power of Attorney for a Child Needed?\n\nAs long as a parent (or guardian) is available, there is no need for a power of attorney for your child. However, if neither parent is available to do things such as sign a medical consent form, another adult can be authorized to do so with a document commonly called a power of attorney for child or power of attorney for minor child.\n\nThis is typically done when parents are going out of town (for vacation, work, military deployment, etc.) and will be leaving a child with friends or relatives, or when a child is being sent out of town to live with friends or relatives.\n\nA power of attorney for child gives the designated agent the temporary authority to make decisions, but the parent still retains the same authority. In a guardianship, the parental authority is permanently transferred to the legal guardian, and the parent no longer has the authority to make decisions for the child. A parent may revoke a power of attorney at any time, but only a court can change guardianship.\"", "How do I give someone all rights to make magical decisions for ME?", "This is exactly what I thought!

Fast forward to now and I\u2019m still reluctant to even let my mom watch my son for long even if it\u2019s to take a much needed rest. He is my first and I couldn\u2019t imagine leaving him for so long then hearing he is in the hospital? Then take another three hours? This makes me want to knock some sense into this woman! That baby is precious and needs a mother! If she can\u2019t be a mother then she needs to give up her rights to someone who will.

My mind immediately went to Fundy/IBLP. She sounds like she was parentified while at home but also so entrinched with family the idea of being without us too much. She probably struggled mentally and emotionally after being cut out from her family so she has associated bad things with being away from them and safety with being at home. And since they, definite AH, want nothing to do with her child she is losing the mental war of stay with your child or go home to your family. These cult type groups cause deep mental harm. I don\u2019t think she is intentionally wishing to harm this child but possibly not capable of making the right decision. Regardless, she has put the child at risk and you are doing the right thing. Further, continuing to advocate for this child might help her eventually see the light and cut ties, but that is also not your cross to bear.

I have my mom and one of my siblings written on their thing to be able to take my kid in. I do say ESH though. The way you phrased it is intimidating, legal rights/guardianship can be a serious deal and should not be taken lightly at all. If someone asked me for legal rights over my child or guardianship I'd be a little pissy, like no that's my baby. She's TA because she's constantly leaving the baby with you with no safety net for medical emergencies and not answering the phone when you were calling.

Why does this give me the beginning of Flowers in the Attic vibes? What\u2019s her plan when the kid gets older and wants to know why she spends so much time with family he\u2019s kept away from? Poor child.", "So many AHs from her parents most of all and her as well for ditching her baby so much! She is going to have to choose at some point her parents or baby. If she chooses poorly then step in for baby. If she keeps disappearing you should call social services.", "NTA. She wants to have her cake and eat it too.  Stop watching the baby.  If she can't answer her phone you don't need to be watching her baby ever again.     If her family cannot accept her child she should not be dealing with them. \n\nShe needs to come to terms with her decision to have the child and be a mother.  Her child is her priority above all else. The baby didn't ask to be born. \n\nYour friend has a lot of growing up to do.   You don't need guardianship over her child.  She needs to do her chosen job and take care of her child and be a mother at all times,  no matter the cost.", "NTA, nor is her relationship with her parents your problem. She had the ONS and that means that she has to take responsibility for her decisions, you can't guarantee that he won't get sick again and you would have to take him to the hospital. \n\nMotherhood has sacrifices and she knew where her parents stood with what she decided to do. Now she has to be a responsible parent and see to it that if for any reason in the future her child needs medical attention, there is someone authorized to get him treatment.", "That, with the fact that she was unreachable for so many hours. It just doesn\u2019t make sense with the story she is selling", "At this point wouldn\u2019t adoption be a kinder option for the baby? Please remind your friend of that! Also forget guardianship or a paper saying you can make medical decisions.... she can pay for a babysitter. If I was the babysitter (like I was when I was a teen) and they were unreachable during a medical emergency for 6 hours I would never babysit for that person again!", "Also the UK does not have mandatory reporting for child abuse or neglect. You can take any kid to an emergency room here and unless there is a visible sign of abuse or neglect such as a suspicion injury or the child is dirty and underweight, hospitals cannot just call in social workers. It\u2019s a shitty system that causes massive harm but they have no powers for stepping in if a parent is AWOL like this even though it screams problems.\n\nAlso if she\u2019s in the UK, then to us a hour plus drive is a big deal. Our distances and roads are very different and making a three hour round trip here is like a major sign of effort (or living in London.) It\u2019s more like a 6-8 trip for Americans unless you happen to be on a major train line or motorway. But even then it\u2019s a big deal to do every weekend because its expensive as hell. Trains here are \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 and petrol is \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3. So these trips also sound like they are taking a lot of money. Is OP being left with money for caring for the child to cover food, nappies etc or is the \u2018friend\u2019 getting free child care and leaving OP out of pocket on expenses while neglecting her sick kid? \n\nIf the friend was working she\u2019s probably getting at least Statutory Maternity Pay of around \u00a3136 a week plus maybe some Universal Credit and child benefit and may get help with rent so the state is stepping in to help as we also have very lax child support laws compared to the US. If she isn\u2019t working, she can claim similar state help but it\u2019s not untold riches and clearly if she started leaving the baby at 4 months, he is formula fed and formula is hella expensive on benefits. Between that and nappies, OP is probably also helping fund the baby as well as raising him. Isn\u2019t 6 months around when babies start beginning to want to wean and start foods so OP is also in a situation where having the baby for whole unreachable weekends is taking over the establishing of a routine, major milestones and a de facto parent. She shouldn\u2019t be making decisions about a kid\u2019s health or diet who isn\u2019t hers because here if social services do ever get involved, they aim for \u2018kinship care\u2019 first which means they would ask OP to take the kid as they live there. There is not much foster compensation here and kinship care is particularly badly served so OP can have legal rights bestowed on her without much choice and have her whole life and fiances turned upside down.\n\nI think the medical form is the least of it. She needs to see a child law specialist ASAP because it sounds like the friend is doing a slow fade on her *baby* leaving OP to deal with him and it\u2019s absolutely unfair on OP and kid. She should take advice how she proceeds to flag this to the authorities including that if she has formed a bond she might want to become foster parent or she might not want to be involved at all.\n\nI\u2019m estranged from family and I know how being cast out can fuck with you but this woman is 30, has a six month old baby and left him knowing he was sick and was out of reach for 9 hours. Good or safe aren\u2019t words I would use here about her.", "Literally what I just commented because it\u2019s the first thing I thought about.", "Not erasing the baby from their perfect family, but being practical. How can their Eldest Daughter raise her baby and siblings at the same time? /s", "Sounds like OP is basically the other parent so I doubt the baby is suffering.", "I think she's visiting her family. She helped raise her siblings she loved and missed them while she was disowned. She knows her baby is safe with her friend and in a familiar environment. She's probably just so happy to have e her family back. Things had to be hard when she was disowned and raising a newborn."]}
