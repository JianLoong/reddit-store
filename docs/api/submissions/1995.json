We have been friends for almost a decade and have lived together a few times over the years and when I bought my place she asked to move in. It was a good deal, she gets to save to buy by paying reduced rent and I get some help with the mortgage. \n\nMy friend is also from a super religious family but does not follow a lot of her families beliefs now (premarital sex, drinking etc) her parents have accepted this but ask that she keeps that part of her life hidden. The problems started when my friend found out she was pregnant from a ONS and decided to keep the baby. \n\nHer parents disowned her and she was heartbroken, but not surprised. I told her that I was ok with her continuing to pay rent here and live with me for as long as she needs and she gave birth to her baby boy A 6 months ago. \n\nAround 2 months ago her parents got back in touch and told her they\u2019d like to see her. She has lots of much younger siblings who she helped raise so she was super excited to go and see them, but they asked her not to take the baby as they don\u2019t want to be involved with him. \n\nI offered to look after A while she saw her siblings, thinking it would be a one time deal. Now she visits them almost every weekend and sometimes during the week (often staying the night) while I look after A. \n\nI didn\u2019t mind too much to begin with (he\u2019s a very good baby and I love hanging out with him) but A got sick last weekend just before she left to stay at her parents house for the night and after his temperature got super high I took him to the hospital. It took her SIX hours to answer her phone and she still didn\u2019t come to the hospital for another three (her parents live an hour away). \n\nI felt so powerless when A was sick, because I\u2019m not his mum or guardian and the hospital had regulations about how much I could do for and be with him and although he\u2019s better now, I\u2019m worried about looking after him again. \n\nShe asked me to take care of him again this weekend and I lost it, I explained that she had really put me in a horrible position while he was ill and if she doesn\u2019t give me some sort of guardianship/medical rights over him I won\u2019t be watching him again. \n\nShe cried and said I\u2019m holding her hostage now by giving her an ultimatum that means she can\u2019t see her parents if she doesn\u2019t agree to give me rights to her son and now I feel like I may be TA.", "created_utc": 1668111240, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrqixv/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_needs_to_give_me/", "score": 2687, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Okay first of all NTA. Not even close.\n\nSecond of all, if she doesn\u2019t see how dangerous this situation could have been for her SON, that\u2019s a problem. It\u2019s great she\u2019s trying to re-connect with her family, but she\u2019s a mother now and she can\u2019t just leave her kid every weekend to hang out with people who want to pretend he doesn\u2019t exist. That isn\u2019t healthy, and it\u2019s bordering on abuse / neglect. The only reason I say bordering is because thankfully she has you there to take care of this baby.\n\nThere is a fairly easy process to grant someone medical proxy in most states. She wouldn\u2019t be giving up her rights to her son in any way, she\u2019s just allowing you to make medical decisions in the even there is another emergency and she TAKES 6 HOURS TO REPLY. I cannot, under any circumstances, imagine a scenario where I am still breathing and it takes me that long to check my phone when one of my kids is with a babysitter.", "NTA. Honestly, I think you\u2019re focusing on the entirely wrong thing here.  Your friend found out her baby was in the hospital and did not care. Does that sound healthy to you? Is that the kind of person you want to live with?\n\nYou *really* need to ask yourself exactly how involved you want to be here. Because your friend sounds like a horrible parent and you taking care of this baby is wallpapering over that.\n\nDo you imagine yourself \u201dbabysitting\u201d this kid every weekend six years from now? Ten?", "NTA. A simple medical consent form would be easy to do and there\u2019s also things like limited power of attorney. As a p/t babysitter a medical consent form is probably the best fit.", "NTA\n\nYou need a medical consent form which allows you to seek treatment while you are supervising the child, since it sounds like you're watching this child overnight. These are fairly simple and often common (they're often in the massive stack of paperwork you have to sign to enroll your kid in daycare or summer camp, for example). \n\nYour friend's pediatrician should have a template copy that they accept or be able to refer you to where to get one.", "Nta - you seem a lot more concerned by the baby safety than her, which is scary - six hours before answering ??? three hours to come back ? If the situation happens again, hospital will call CPS against her... Be carefull, she should be bonding with her baby not dropping him any chance she gets... You're sure she goes in her family ??", "NTA\n\nYour friend is more worried about their relationship than HER OWN BABY that she\u2019s okay with leaving it with you for multiple days. She sounds like a terrible mother and is allowing her family to pressure her. She needs to cut them out. They don\u2019t even want to see her child and would rather she hide her baby\u2019s EXISTENCE? She sucks for allowing herself to be manipulated by her family and her family is majorly toxic.", "NTA. But not really sure having legal parental/guardian rights are needed. Not sure what country your in but if you take a baby to a medical professional they're going to help/treat it regardless of who brings it in. Worst case, they might raise a safeguarding concern but that's your friends problem, not yours. \n\nMore importantly, do you really want to be a surrogate mum to this kid, because it sounds like it's going to keep happen\n\nMore, more importantly why don't her parents want to see their grandkid and why is she abandoning her kid to see them? I know, super religious, but still are they going to ignore this kid its whole life?", "Nta. You need some sort of paper that says you can seek medical treatment cause its clear she wont come running if baby needs help. You are in a really weird situation and im sorry for it.", "NTA\nShe is totally the AH, who can she agree to see her  \u201cfamily\u201d without her boy, that is just plain sad. She is 30 , she need to be responsible for her son not you, plus she is the legal guardian not you in an emergency she is the only one who can make decision. I hope she finally fight for her son with her family now that you ask her to make you a legal guardian.", "NTA - I was curious to see where this was going. I guess you kind of have a point though. She cannot regularly leave the baby with you for long periods of time and be that unreachable without making sure you at least have the right to get the baby medical care when he needs it. I am sure there are simple forms you could both sign that would give you medical power of attorney in her absence without actually giving you custody/parental rights. \n\nBut I think there are much larger issues at play here. Obviously she is in a very emotionally vulnerable state given the stress surrounding her pregnancy and being disowned by her family. Her behavior seems a bit off. Has she been evaluated for PPD? Did she visit her parents this much before the baby? Are you sure her parents know that she kept the baby? It sounds like maybe she told them she put it up for adoption to get back in their good graces. Even if they don't want to see the baby, they must wonder where it is while she is with them.", "NTA. The baby should come first for her. The biggest issue is why isn\u2019t it?", "NTA, from the title I thought you wanted her to give up the baby entirely, but making sure you can make medical decisions if need be makes perfect sense if he's in your care that often.", "your roommate needs to realize she's a mom now. she can't play mom when it's convenient to her and she has to stop putting her parents and herself above her child.\n\ni understand she wants a relationship with her parents but why at the cost of her son's wellbeing?\n\nyou, however, are in no position to demand any rights to this child. babysit him or don't, but at the end of the day you are only that - a babysitter.\n\nESH because you both are handling this situation in the worst way possible.\n\ntell her to pull her head out of her ass and build healthy boundaries with her parents because she's neglecting her son for them", "NTA, but your friend sure is. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have to give you guardianship, but she needs to sign something that says you have all right to make magical decisions for the baby if/ when she cannot be contacted. \nI\u2019d probably get it notarized while I\u2019m at it. \n\nSo there\u2019s that, now as far as holding her hostage?  Oh no, she\u2019s got that backwards. \n\nLet\u2019s look at this - her parents want nothing to do with her when she gets pregnant, then they say, yeah come back into the fold- but without the baby. \n\nSo your friend is just having it all isn\u2019t she?  She gets to dump ( yes, I say dump, because that\u2019s exactly what she\u2019s doing) the baby on you whenever she feels like going home. \n\nAnd then when she\u2019s good and ready to come back she resumes care of HER CHILD. \n\nYou are a saint for agreeing to any of this. \n\nShe needs to decide, is she a mother to the child who she decided to keep full well knowing how her parents would react, or is she going to pretend he doesn\u2019t exist to make her parents happy? \nThis baby isn\u2019t going to disappear, you will be watching this boy for years to come because if her parents don\u2019t accept him now what makes you think that will ever change. \n\nAre you ok with that?", "ESH. The needs of the baby come first, stop providing her an out where she can pretend that she didn't have the baby to get back in the good graces of her rotten whacko parents. She either takes the baby with her to her parents or she doesn't go, those are the only two options. You taking over as part-time mom is off the table.", "NTA. Your friend is not being the mother she needs to be for that child. My niece gave birth about 2 months ago, and I live with her. No way in hell would she be leaving that child with me for multiple nights every week, even 4 months from now. In most states she can sign a paper giving you permission to make medical decisions. If my mom takes my kids on a trip, I'll give her one in case there's an emergency. You can find a template online. But that's not the solution to this problem. The solution is your friend taking full responsibility for her child.", "NTA, . . . But, Erm . . . Are we sure she is really seeing her parents this much? She chose them over her child? Or is she out doing other things. Because really . . . 6 hours? Then another 3 to get to a hospital? Nah.", "NTA, this is co-parenting, and you can't safely co-parent in a situation like that.", "NTA, her parents are the ones putting her in this situation.  If she's going to choose her parents over her own baby then she should give him up for adoption.   \n\nAnd what you are asking for is not phrased correctly, unless you ARE asking to adopt him.  You need some kind of guardianship papers at the most, but honestly the mom should just contact the hospital/doctors to sign a release letting you care for the child in her absence", "Nta. Ask the hospital what you need. It maybe as simple as a power of attorney for medical needs, which is easy to do.", "NTA. You are not holding your friend hostage, she us using you. She can find someone else to sit her baby.  You should probably back as far away as possible from this situation b/c your \"friend\" is only going to demand more and more from you. She needs to take care of her kid.", "NTA", "NTA and in most states it is super easy to sign a medical power of attorney. My husband and I did it for my mom when she watched our kids when we went on vacation. They have a plethora of forms you can use online for free. Additionally when filling out the MPOA she can elect to have it only effective until a certain date (i.e. when she gets back). It's really just the smart thing to do if you are going to be away from your child and not reachable. In no way would she be giving you 'legal rights' over her child, but just empowering you to ensure his safety while she is gone.", "NTA but I think you don't know what the problem really is.\n\nShe is the mother, she is abusing you and neglecting her own child.\n\nYou should analyze things better. You yourself are accepting responsibilities that do not correspond to you and that in the long run she will not value.", "You don\u2019t need any rights. She needs to sign a medical consent form. This allows you to give permission for the child to be treated by physicians and for physicians to provide you with  access to the child\u2019s medical information. Also, your friends parents are the ones \u201cholding her hostage\u201d. *They* put her in a shitty position where she isnt allowed to bring her baby around them, not you. It\u2019s irresponsible of her as a parent to prioritize frequent family visits over being with her baby. If anything, she\u2019s is holding *you* hostage as a babysitter by asking so frequently (most weekends) and staying out on her visits for long periods of time (not just an hour or 2, and regularly overnight). She is seriously overstepping and taking advantage of your kindness. Yes you love the child, but based on this post, I get the sense you feel like you can\u2019t say no when she asks, or would feel extremely guilty doing so. I\u2019m happy you put your foot down and told her what your ground rules are for watching the child in the future. NTA. EDIT: Spelling", "NTA!! This sounds like some \u201cFlowers in the Attic\u201d nonsense", "You sure she's actually visiting family and not a man?\n\nEither way she's taking advantage of you and you have to put an end to it.", "No way are you the ahole.  She is taking gross advantage of you.  At a minimum you need some sort of authority to make decisions for the child.  And you need to set up firm boundaries about how often you are willing to do the work of parenting this kid.\n\nYou are putting yourself at risk too if anything happens to him.  She's irresponsible and untrustworthy.  I could see her suing you.  You should find out what your liability could be.\n\nNTA.  Next time she abandons her kid without your permission, call the cops.", "NTA\n\nAre you sure she is with her relatives and not out partying? Most parents bring their child when they visit parents and siblings. That, with the fact that she was unreachable for so many hours. It just doesn\u2019t make sense with the story she is selling.", "Nta. She is not a fit mother. Call social services. Who doesn\u2019t care that their child is in hospital? Who gladly leaves their child at home and is so desperate to meet up with family that don\u2019t want him? She is not a good mother. She\u2019s not even a good person", "I love when titles make me think y.ta when the actual situation is complete NTA.\n\nYou're not asking for sole rights to him, just enough to be able to make medical decisions for him when she is too busy to bother caring for her child.

The second the parent is unavailable when something goes wrong, I would never watch that kid again. NTA stop letting her take advantage of you.

It gives you the legal ability to make medical decisions but does not give you custody or parental rights over the child.\n\n\"When Is a Power of Attorney for a Child Needed?\n\nAs long as a parent (or guardian) is available, there is no need for a power of attorney for your child. However, if neither parent is available to do things such as sign a medical consent form, another adult can be authorized to do so with a document commonly called a power of attorney for child or power of attorney for minor child.\n\nThis is typically done when parents are going out of town (for vacation, work, military deployment, etc.) and will be leaving a child with friends or relatives, or when a child is being sent out of town to live with friends or relatives.\n\nA power of attorney for child gives the designated agent the temporary authority to make decisions, but the parent still retains the same authority. In a guardianship, the parental authority is permanently transferred to the legal guardian, and the parent no longer has the authority to make decisions for the child. A parent may revoke a power of attorney at any time, but only a court can change guardianship.\"", "How do I give someone all rights to make magical decisions for ME?", "This is exactly what I thought!

This all just seems like either she needs to place him for adoption and go back home to her family to rekindle what she seems to not want to part with for the sake of her own child, or make a choice to end contact with family that is not being supportive and carry on with her adult life with her child.

I had my baby prematurely by a little over a month\u2026it killed me just to have him taken out of me by emergency c section then to barely see him before they rushed him to a better children\u2019s hospital to be in the NICU. Fast forward to now and I\u2019m still reluctant to even let my mom watch my son for long even if it\u2019s to take a much needed rest. He is my first and I couldn\u2019t imagine leaving him for so long then hearing he is in the hospital? Then take another three hours? This makes me want to knock some sense into this woman! That baby is precious and needs a mother! If she can\u2019t be a mother then she needs to give up her rights to someone who will.

My mind immediately went to Fundy/IBLP. She sounds like she was parentified while at home but also so entrinched with family the idea of being without us too much. She probably struggled mentally and emotionally after being cut out from her family so she has associated bad things with being away from them and safety with being at home. And since they, definite AH, want nothing to do with her child she is losing the mental war of stay with your child or go home to your family. These cult type groups cause deep mental harm. I don\u2019t think she is intentionally wishing to harm this child but possibly not capable of making the right decision. Regardless, she has put the child at risk and you are doing the right thing. Further, continuing to advocate for this child might help her eventually see the light and cut ties, but that is also not your cross to bear. If that is a benefit, great, but you don\u2019t owe her that.

Her actions created this conflict and she has to deal with it now.", "I would start making  a case against her, so that baby can have a better life. Does the father know he has a son?

I have my mom and one of my siblings written on their thing to be able to take my kid in. I do say ESH though. The way you phrased it is intimidating, legal rights/guardianship can be a serious deal and should not be taken lightly at all. If someone asked me for legal rights over my child or guardianship I'd be a little pissy, like no that's my baby. She's TA because she's constantly leaving the baby with you with no safety net for medical emergencies and not answering the phone when you were calling.

If she chooses poorly then step in for baby. If she keeps disappearing you should call social services.", "NTA. She wants to have her cake and eat it too.  Stop watching the baby.  If she can't answer her phone you don't need to be watching her baby ever again.     If her family cannot accept her child she should not be dealing with them. \n\nShe needs to come to terms with her decision to have the child and be a mother.  Her child is her priority above all else. The baby didn't ask to be born. \n\nYour friend has a lot of growing up to do.   You don't need guardianship over her child.  She needs to do her chosen job and take care of her child and be a mother at all times,  no matter the cost.", "NTA, nor is her relationship with her parents your problem. She had the ONS and that means that she has to take responsibility for her decisions, you can't guarantee that he won't get sick again and you would have to take him to the hospital. \n\nMotherhood has sacrifices and she knew where her parents stood with what she decided to do. Now she has to be a responsible parent and see to it that if for any reason in the future her child needs medical attention, there is someone authorized to get him treatment.", "That, with the fact that she was unreachable for so many hours. It just doesn\u2019t make sense with the story she is selling", "At this point wouldn\u2019t adoption be a kinder option for the baby? Please remind your friend of that! Also forget guardianship or a paper saying you can make medical decisions.... she can pay for a babysitter. If I was the babysitter (like I was when I was a teen) and they were unreachable during a medical emergency for 6 hours I would never babysit for that person again!", "Also the UK does not have mandatory reporting for child abuse or neglect. You can take any kid to an emergency room here and unless there is a visible sign of abuse or neglect such as a suspicion injury or the child is dirty and underweight, hospitals cannot just call in social workers. It\u2019s a shitty system that causes massive harm but they have no powers for stepping in if a parent is AWOL like this even though it screams problems.\n\nAlso if she\u2019s in the UK, then to us a hour plus drive is a big deal. Our distances and roads are very different and making a three hour round trip here is like a major sign of effort (or living in London.) It\u2019s more like a 6-8 trip for Americans unless you happen to be on a major train line or motorway. But even then it\u2019s a big deal to do every weekend because its expensive as hell. Trains here are \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 and petrol is \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3. So these trips also sound like they are taking a lot of money. Is OP being left with money for caring for the child to cover food, nappies etc or is the \u2018friend\u2019 getting free child care and leaving OP out of pocket on expenses while neglecting her sick kid? \n\nIf the friend was working she\u2019s probably getting at least Statutory Maternity Pay of around \u00a3136 a week plus maybe some Universal Credit and child benefit and may get help with rent so the state is stepping in to help as we also have very lax child support laws compared to the US. If she isn\u2019t working, she can claim similar state help but it\u2019s not untold riches and clearly if she started leaving the baby at 4 months, he is formula fed and formula is hella expensive on benefits. Between that and nappies, OP is probably also helping fund the baby as well as raising him. Isn\u2019t 6 months around when babies start beginning to want to wean and start foods so OP is also in a situation where having the baby for whole unreachable weekends is taking over the establishing of a routine, major milestones and a de facto parent. She shouldn\u2019t be making decisions about a kid\u2019s health or diet who isn\u2019t hers because here if social services do ever get involved, they aim for \u2018kinship care\u2019 first which means they would ask OP to take the kid as they live there. There is not much foster compensation here and kinship care is particularly badly served so OP can have legal rights bestowed on her without much choice and have her whole life and fiances turned upside down.\n\nI think the medical form is the least of it. She needs to see a child law specialist ASAP because it sounds like the friend is doing a slow fade on her *baby* leaving OP to deal with him and it\u2019s absolutely unfair on OP and kid. She should take advice how she proceeds to flag this to the authorities including that if she has formed a bond she might want to become foster parent or she might not want to be involved at all.\n\nI\u2019m estranged from family and I know how being cast out can fuck with you but this woman is 30, has a six month old baby and left him knowing he was sick and was out of reach for 9 hours.

Don't get me wrong: Leaving your baby with another person every weekend is not OK, but she doesn't sound like a person who doesn't care for her child. Agh I wish I could explain this better, but hear me out: She was willing to keep the baby and being disowned by her family and it seems she was a good mom before her family reached out to her. She is so desperate to be back with her family that she doesn't realise how they manipulate her to abandoned her child. She probably thought that she only have to give them time and they will welcome him into the family while they use her to take care of her siblings (at least that's what it sounds like). Do you know that she had her phone with her when you tried to phone her? Or did her parents have it? Did you ask her why it took her another three hours to come to the hospital? Again, there is a possibility that her parents told her something along the line \"if you go now don't come back\". \n\nI swear to myself to not going too deep into speculations in Reddit (you know like everytime there is a relationship issue someone is cheating?) but there are some really concerning red flags coming from her parents. What kind of parents are ok with her daughter leaving her baby behind? What kind of parents do disown their adult daughter because she got pregnant, only to reach out to her again when the baby is a few months old and act like the baby doesn't exist? What kind of parents are ok with a mother (doesn't even habe to be the own daughter) ignoring an emergency with her child? Oh yeah, I bet they knew about that. \n\nIf I go deeper into this rabbit hole, I also bet that your friend knows how bad everything would sound when she tells you that her parents told her if she goes to her child they would disown her again. Again, I don't know her or her situation but it pretty much sounds like a person who tries to justify abusive behaviour because \"nobody understands\". Sit her down and talk to her without arguing, maybe you can convince her to get the help she needs but you can't provide.", "NTA. You're not even remotely close to holding her hostage, and if you care about her or the kid you're probably going to have to push this even further.\n\nYou're entirely right to do this.

If you give any more slack this will just get a whole lot worse.\n\nSo I'd say hold your ground, and realize you might have to have her evicted and/or get child protective services involved.

If that\u2019s fine with her, OK, but the possibility exists that they would want to put him into foster care and wash their hands of him. The way for her to control that ahead of time would be to get a will that states her wishes for the child and gives instructions to you for what to do in the event of her untimely passing. That\u2019s a big conversation for you two to have, but I think it needs to be done ASAP. Good luck.", "NTA. Please get CPS involved.", "NTA, You are literally co-parenting at this point. She cannot expect to ditch her baby this often. Tell her she needs to either force her parents to deal with it or stop seeing them because this is absolutely not your circus/monkey.", "NTA. She\u2019s not a good person, she doesn\u2019t care about her own kid, so you are 100% right. If she is going to leave the kid with you AND you are happy with that, then you need some rights.", "NTA. It\u2019s her parents who are holding her hostage. She shouldn\u2019t be going over there and excluding her son. If her parents don\u2019t want a relationship with her baby they shouldn\u2019t be entitled to a relationship with her.", "NTA", "Sounds like your friend is the asshole here, choosing for her parents in stead of her child. I can understand she needs some time to steam off, but a weekly thing is too much to ask. \n\nThat little baby is going to accept you more as his mom, cause you\u2019re the one staying with him in sickness. \n\nIt seems fair enough to have some kind of rights to help him in dangerous situations. But I also want to warn you about the possibility your friend leaving the child with you for ever to go back to her parents.\n\nIf you\u2019re happy to have him for the rest of your life, make sure you get the full parental rights so she can\u2019t get back and snoop him away.", "NTA. This is going to sound really harsh, but if you have to take the baby to the hospital again, you need to call the police and file child abandonment charges after about two hours of trying to contact your roommate. The hospital will even help you do it. You're not giving her an ultimatum that stops her from seeing her parents. Her parents need to accept that she has a child, a child they would have been livid with their daughter over had she chosen to abort him (just pointing that out real quick), but at the same time have put her in the position of feeling like she can't be a mother to him, either, which she clearly doesn't really want to do. Your roommate is trying to \"return home\" like her child never happened, and that's just not going to be a possibility unless she gives him up for adoption or allows him to be taken by the state.", "NTA. But if she goes to her parent's house, and leaves you to watch A, even when you told her no, call CPS as soon as she closes that door.", "You're holding her hostage? LMAO. She's holding you hostage by constantly expecting you to care for HER child for FREE. If she wants to see her parents more tell her to pay a babysitter. NTA.", "I would involve CPS asap! What\u2019s going on is not normal and she need to acknowledge that!", "Also, the baby got sick BEFORE she left and she left anyways. \n\nOP, at the very least stand your ground - you aren\u2019t watching the baby without legal guardianship. But seriously consider what you want your role to be. Your friend is a terrible mother. She is allowing her family to blame an innocent baby, abandoning him on a weekly basis, and didn\u2019t care when he got sick. Do not continue to enable her to be a neglectful parent. She needs to decide if she\u2019s actually going to parent.", "Treatment advocate, ask your PCP. It\u2019s. A release form that allows the designated person to make and cancel appointments as well as medical choices. You should also have an advance directive as well as a mental health advance directive.", "A person who quietly resents their child for existing.", "I half wonder if, on some level, she blames her baby for the temporary estrangement. It\u2019d certainly explain why she\u2019s falling all over herself for her siblings and ignoring her baby.", "You can sorta see the AITA years from now from the child \"AITA for picking my Mums best friend over my Mum as she bought me up and raised me cause I was shunned by my Mums ultra religious family\"\n\nOP is NTA but does need to set clear boundaries and have her friend step up and parent this child!", "Sounds Mormon. I was in that Cult for 40 years. Sick.", "But children should always come first  regardless", "Nta at some point she gotta realise that she is neglecting the child also SHE CAN PAY FOR A BABBY SITTER", "NTA. You are asking for a medical power of attorney.  She doesn\u2019t prioritize her child over her hateful family. Does she not realize the this easily a case for CPS? And at least if something happened to her while she is traveling to see those hypocrites her baby would wind up in foster care. Stress the medical POA. This way she can the way word daughter finding her way home with minimal impact to her son.", "NTA. She\u2019s being negligent. It\u2019s her child and responsibility.", "NTA\n\nThere is a way to get a power of attorney quite easily without \u201cparental rights\u201d to the baby. I would want to consider, however, what the long term future is holding here. What if something happened to mom? Would her family be taking in this baby they\u2019ve shunned? That\u2019s probably a separate conversation but  maybe one OP should start thinking about as far as what she wants her long term commitment to this child potentially to look like.\n\nEdit to add: I was able to get a power of attorney in my state for a teenager I took into my home for a school year when their family had to move. It was a form I found online. I called both the school and the probate court in my area to see what I needed and they agreed it was just a POA. I typed up the form and the mother signed it in front of a notary. I didn\u2019t even need to file it anywhere (but did bring it to the school so a copy could be out j to his school file).", "NTA. She\u2019s trying to reconnect with a family that rejected her. And now rejects her child. She should want nothing to do with them. She\u2019s abandoning her child FOR them. She\u2019s choosing them over him every time she leaves. I think this is way above Reddits pay grade. This sounds like a CPS situation in the making. Doesn\u2019t sound like a good mother and that child is going to suffer.", "NTA \n\nYour friend needs to go to therapy though. She's willing to abandon her kid for her parents approval. They want nothing to do with their grandchild, yet she wants a relationship with them? \n\nShe is stuck in a trauma bond it sounds like and she needs to see a therapist.", "NTA. She\u2019s dumping her child on you so she can play happy family as a child herself but you are 100% in the right here. If you don\u2019t have the ability to provide him what he needs and she won\u2019t respond to calls you actually have little choice in the matter. If she does do this again, a call to CPS and/or the police is in order for child abandonment and/or neglect.", "NTA, but don't do it.  She is using you and you need to cut the cord.  Sit down and determine an exit plan for your friend and her child. She needs to find a long-term plan and you can't be a key aspect of her future.  Also talk to her about her new relationship with her family.  Is she really okay with not having her child know her family?  If so, then she needs to figure out how to do this without you being involved.  You have to learn to say 'No' and mean it.  Don't accept guardianship or POA for medical issues.  None of this is your issue and you need to just stop and think about it.", "NTA you are to enmeshed with the situation. You are her landlord and friend, not partner or live in staff.\n\nCease babysitting duties, her child her responsibilities and her crappy family need to see their grandchild as he is part of them.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if it turned out she\u2019s just partying or dating while you\u2019re at home with her baby.", "NTA\n\nFirst things first you're not the one giving her an ultimatum, her mother is. Second, she could get childcare if it was so important to have her cake and eat it, she just wants to keep using you as free childcare with zero effort or changes. Third, you're not even asking that much???", "She can' t see her parents as an adult?\nWhat about her son her lovely parents refuse to aknowledge???\n\nAnd you are not!!! her live-in nanny.\n\nNTA", "You need the advice of a therapist, social worker, and lawyer. Not Reddit. NTA. Are you positive she\u2019s actually going to see her family?", "NTA \n\nAs other commenters have pointed out, I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s leaving her newborn son weekly with no regard. A new mom myself, the thought of leaving my kiddo at all makes my heart hurt. Could I do it? Yes. Every weekend? Absolutely not. \n\nYou definitely need medical consent at a minimum should this continue for his safety and the wellbeing of this child.", "NTA also have your friend watch \u201cFlowers in the attic\u201d.", "NTA I can\u2019t imagine leaving my child to visit my PARENTS who want NOTHING to do with my child???", "NTA\n\nHonestly. It would give this child a bigger network. His mother has already abandoned him save for signing her rights away, which you haven't ask her to do, you've merely asked thst if she is going to continue putting her son in compromising scenarios then you need to be able to act, so she needs to give you aome say. What's worse is this child will never know his maternal family due to their own biases and bullshit, and his mother has denied him any paternal relationships by not finding the guy or knowing the guy well enough before continuing her pregnancy. This kid needs as many people as he can get who are willing to be there for him, and it sounds like the only person doing that is you. Start recording the time you care for him. Establish a bond.  Then take it to court. Your friend is very irresponsible for having this baby and then going back to her family who will not be there for him.", "6 hours to reply and 3 hours to arrive when her parents are only 1 hour away.", "Also the friend sends more interested in being a parent to her siblings (who have parents),  than to her baby (who has no one eke)\n\nThe only people giving ultimatums preventing her from seeing the parents,  are the parents saying she must abandon her child to see them. \n\nOP should point out she is not this child's parent and she can not be responsible fur the baby so often. \n\nNTA", "Jeebus. And I was thinking of the other \"caught up\". OP is getting so involved with this child, I was having flashes of those horror stories where roommates get stuck paying child support.\n\nAnd getting guardianship/medical rights is not gonna help that situation.", "Agreed. There may be an indicated report about this incident even if they weren\u2019t called in real time.", "Can't agree with this more. It nearly broke me.", "I\u2019m even wondering if she\u2019s actually going to to see her family or if she\u2019s using her family as an excuse to get out of the house and having a social life.", "Can't possibly have OPs friend showing her siblings the bad example of single mother.\n\nIn fact it would serve as a good warning against pre marital sex.", "This is evolving into some \"Flowers in the Attic\" type shit.  \nThey KNOW she has a fucking kid, but are forcing her to HIDE him to be part of the family, and she is doing so to the detriment of her child.  \n OP - no powdered donuts for baby!", "Right? Mom doesn't sound like she's remotely ready or prepared for any of this."]}
