We have been friends for almost a decade and have lived together a few times over the years and when I bought my place she asked to move in. It was a good deal, she gets to save to buy by paying reduced rent and I get some help with the mortgage. \n\nMy friend is also from a super religious family but does not follow a lot of her families beliefs now (premarital sex, drinking etc) her parents have accepted this but ask that she keeps that part of her life hidden. The problems started when my friend found out she was pregnant from a ONS and decided to keep the baby. \n\nHer parents disowned her and she was heartbroken, but not surprised. I told her that I was ok with her continuing to pay rent here and live with me for as long as she needs and she gave birth to her baby boy A 6 months ago. \n\nAround 2 months ago her parents got back in touch and told her they\u2019d like to see her. She has lots of much younger siblings who she helped raise so she was super excited to go and see them, but they asked her not to take the baby as they don\u2019t want to be involved with him. \n\nI offered to look after A while she saw her siblings, thinking it would be a one time deal. Now she visits them almost every weekend and sometimes during the week (often staying the night) while I look after A. \n\nI didn\u2019t mind too much to begin with (he\u2019s a very good baby and I love hanging out with him) but A got sick last weekend just before she left to stay at her parents house for the night and after his temperature got super high I took him to the hospital. It took her SIX hours to answer her phone and she still didn\u2019t come to the hospital for another three (her parents live an hour away). \n\nI felt so powerless when A was sick, because I\u2019m not his mum or guardian and the hospital had regulations about how much I could do for and be with him and although he\u2019s better now, I\u2019m worried about looking after him again. \n\nShe asked me to take care of him again this weekend and I lost it, I explained that she had really put me in a horrible position while he was ill and if she doesn\u2019t give me some sort of guardianship/medical rights over him I won\u2019t be watching him again. \n\nShe cried and said I\u2019m holding her hostage now by giving her an ultimatum that means she can\u2019t see her parents if she doesn\u2019t agree to give me rights to her son and now I feel like I may be TA.", "created_utc": 1668111240, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrqixv/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_needs_to_give_me/", "score": 783, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Okay first of all NTA. Not even close.\n\nSecond of all, if she doesn\u2019t see how dangerous this situation could have been for her SON, that\u2019s a problem. It\u2019s great she\u2019s trying to re-connect with her family, but she\u2019s a mother now and she can\u2019t just leave her kid every weekend to hang out with people who want to pretend he doesn\u2019t exist. That isn\u2019t healthy, and it\u2019s bordering on abuse / neglect. The only reason I say bordering is because thankfully she has you there to take care of this baby.\n\nThere is a fairly easy process to grant someone medical proxy in most states. She wouldn\u2019t be giving up her rights to her son in any way, she\u2019s just allowing you to make medical decisions in the even there is another emergency and she TAKES 6 HOURS TO REPLY. I cannot, under any circumstances, imagine a scenario where I am still breathing and it takes me that long to check my phone when one of my kids is with a babysitter.", "NTA. Honestly, I think you\u2019re focusing on the entirely wrong thing here.  Your friend found out her baby was in the hospital and did not care. Does that sound healthy to you? Is that the kind of person you want to live with?\n\nYou *really* need to ask yourself exactly how involved you want to be here. Because your friend sounds like a horrible parent and you taking care of this baby is wallpapering over that.\n\nDo you imagine yourself \u201dbabysitting\u201d this kid every weekend six years from now? Ten?", "NTA. A simple medical consent form would be easy to do and there\u2019s also things like limited power of attorney. As a p/t babysitter a medical consent form is probably the best fit.", "NTA\n\nYou need a medical consent form which allows you to seek treatment while you are supervising the child, since it sounds like you're watching this child overnight. These are fairly simple and often common (they're often in the massive stack of paperwork you have to sign to enroll your kid in daycare or summer camp, for example). \n\nYour friend's pediatrician should have a template copy that they accept or be able to refer you to where to get one.", "Nta - you seem a lot more concerned by the baby safety than her, which is scary - six hours before answering ??? three hours to come back ? If the situation happens again, hospital will call CPS against her... Be carefull, she should be bonding with her baby not dropping him any chance she gets... You're sure she goes in her family ??", "NTA\n\nYour friend is more worried about their relationship than HER OWN BABY that she\u2019s okay with leaving it with you for multiple days. She sounds like a terrible mother and is allowing her family to pressure her. She needs to cut them out. They don\u2019t even want to see her child and would rather she hide her baby\u2019s EXISTENCE? She sucks for allowing herself to be manipulated by her family and her family is majorly toxic.", "NTA. But not really sure having legal parental/guardian rights are needed. Not sure what country your in but if you take a baby to a medical professional they're going to help/treat it regardless of who brings it in. Worst case, they might raise a safeguarding concern but that's your friends problem, not yours. \n\nMore importantly, do you really want to be a surrogate mum to this kid, because it sounds like it's going to keep happen\n\nMore, more importantly why don't her parents want to see their grandkid and why is she abandoning her kid to see them? I know, super religious, but still are they going to ignore this kid its whole life?", "Nta. You need some sort of paper that says you can seek medical treatment cause its clear she wont come running if baby needs help. You are in a really weird situation and im sorry for it.", "NTA\nShe is totally the AH, who can she agree to see her  \u201cfamily\u201d without her boy, that is just plain sad. She is 30 , she need to be responsible for her son not you, plus she is the legal guardian not you in an emergency she is the only one who can make decision. I hope she finally fight for her son with her family now that you ask her to make you a legal guardian.", "NTA - I was curious to see where this was going. I guess you kind of have a point though. She cannot regularly leave the baby with you for long periods of time and be that unreachable without making sure you at least have the right to get the baby medical care when he needs it. I am sure there are simple forms you could both sign that would give you medical power of attorney in her absence without actually giving you custody/parental rights. \n\nBut I think there are much larger issues at play here. Obviously she is in a very emotionally vulnerable state given the stress surrounding her pregnancy and being disowned by her family. Her behavior seems a bit off. Has she been evaluated for PPD? Did she visit her parents this much before the baby? Are you sure her parents know that she kept the baby? It sounds like maybe she told them she put it up for adoption to get back in their good graces. Even if they don't want to see the baby, they must wonder where it is while she is with them.", "NTA. The baby should come first for her. The biggest issue is why isn\u2019t it?", "NTA, from the title I thought you wanted her to give up the baby entirely, but making sure you can make medical decisions if need be makes perfect sense if he's in your care that often.", "your roommate needs to realize she's a mom now. she can't play mom when it's convenient to her and she has to stop putting her parents and herself above her child.\n\ni understand she wants a relationship with her parents but why at the cost of her son's wellbeing?\n\nyou, however, are in no position to demand any rights to this child. babysit him or don't, but at the end of the day you are only that - a babysitter.\n\nESH because you both are handling this situation in the worst way possible.\n\ntell her to pull her head out of her ass and build healthy boundaries with her parents because she's neglecting her son for them", "NTA, but your friend sure is. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have to give you guardianship, but she needs to sign something that says you have all right to make magical decisions for the baby if/ when she cannot be contacted. \nI\u2019d probably get it notarized while I\u2019m at it. \n\nSo there\u2019s that, now as far as holding her hostage?  Oh no, she\u2019s got that backwards. \n\nLet\u2019s look at this - her parents want nothing to do with her when she gets pregnant, then they say, yeah come back into the fold- but without the baby. \n\nSo your friend is just having it all isn\u2019t she?  She gets to dump ( yes, I say dump, because that\u2019s exactly what she\u2019s doing) the baby on you whenever she feels like going home. \n\nAnd then when she\u2019s good and ready to come back she resumes care of HER CHILD. \n\nYou are a saint for agreeing to any of this. \n\nShe needs to decide, is she a mother to the child who she decided to keep full well knowing how her parents would react, or is she going to pretend he doesn\u2019t exist to make her parents happy? \nThis baby isn\u2019t going to disappear, you will be watching this boy for years to come because if her parents don\u2019t accept him now what makes you think that will ever change. \n\nAre you ok with that?", "ESH. The needs of the baby come first, stop providing her an out where she can pretend that she didn't have the baby to get back in the good graces of her rotten whacko parents. She either takes the baby with her to her parents or she doesn't go, those are the only two options. You taking over as part-time mom is off the table.", "NTA. Your friend is not being the mother she needs to be for that child. My niece gave birth about 2 months ago, and I live with her. No way in hell would she be leaving that child with me for multiple nights every week, even 4 months from now. In most states she can sign a paper giving you permission to make medical decisions. If my mom takes my kids on a trip, I'll give her one in case there's an emergency. You can find a template online. But that's not the solution to this problem. The solution is your friend taking full responsibility for her child.", "NTA, . . . But, Erm . . . Are we sure she is really seeing her parents this much? She chose them over her child? Or is she out doing other things. Because really . . . 6 hours? Then another 3 to get to a hospital? Nah.", "NTA, this is co-parenting, and you can't safely co-parent in a situation like that.", "NTA, her parents are the ones putting her in this situation.  If she's going to choose her parents over her own baby then she should give him up for adoption.   \n\nAnd what you are asking for is not phrased correctly, unless you ARE asking to adopt him.  You need some kind of guardianship papers at the most, but honestly the mom should just contact the hospital/doctors to sign a release letting you care for the child in her absence", "Nta. Ask the hospital what you need. It maybe as simple as a power of attorney for medical needs, which is easy to do.", "NTA. You are not holding your friend hostage, she us using you. She can find someone else to sit her baby.  You should probably back as far away as possible from this situation b/c your \"friend\" is only going to demand more and more from you. She needs to take care of her kid.", "NTA", "NTA and in most states it is super easy to sign a medical power of attorney. My husband and I did it for my mom when she watched our kids when we went on vacation. They have a plethora of forms you can use online for free. Additionally when filling out the MPOA she can elect to have it only effective until a certain date (i.e. when she gets back). It's really just the smart thing to do if you are going to be away from your child and not reachable. In no way would she be giving you 'legal rights' over her child, but just empowering you to ensure his safety while she is gone.", "NTA but I think you don't know what the problem really is.\n\nShe is the mother, she is abusing you and neglecting her own child.\n\nYou should analyze things better. You yourself are accepting responsibilities that do not correspond to you and that in the long run she will not value.", "You don\u2019t need any rights. She needs to sign a medical consent form. This allows you to give permission for the child to be treated by physicians and for physicians to provide you with  access to the child\u2019s medical information. Also, your friends parents are the ones \u201cholding her hostage\u201d. *They* put her in a shitty position where she isnt allowed to bring her baby around them, not you. It\u2019s irresponsible of her as a parent to prioritize frequent family visits over being with her baby. If anything, she\u2019s is holding *you* hostage as a babysitter by asking so frequently (most weekends) and staying out on her visits for long periods of time (not just an hour or 2, and regularly overnight). She is seriously overstepping and taking advantage of your kindness. Yes you love the child, but based on this post, I get the sense you feel like you can\u2019t say no when she asks, or would feel extremely guilty doing so. I\u2019m happy you put your foot down and told her what your ground rules are for watching the child in the future. NTA. EDIT: Spelling", "NTA!! This sounds like some \u201cFlowers in the Attic\u201d nonsense", "You sure she's actually visiting family and not a man?\n\nEither way she's taking advantage of you and you have to put an end to it.", "No way are you the ahole.  She is taking gross advantage of you.  At a minimum you need some sort of authority to make decisions for the child.  And you need to set up firm boundaries about how often you are willing to do the work of parenting this kid.\n\nYou are putting yourself at risk too if anything happens to him.  She's irresponsible and untrustworthy.  I could see her suing you.  You should find out what your liability could be.\n\nNTA.  Next time she abandons her kid without your permission, call the cops.", "NTA\n\nAre you sure she is with her relatives and not out partying? Most parents bring their child when they visit parents and siblings. That, with the fact that she was unreachable for so many hours. It just doesn\u2019t make sense with the story she is selling.", "Nta. She is not a fit mother. Call social services. Who doesn\u2019t care that their child is in hospital? Who gladly leaves their child at home and is so desperate to meet up with family that don\u2019t want him? She is not a good mother. She\u2019s not even a good person", "I love when titles make me think y.ta when the actual situation is complete NTA.\n\nYou're not asking for sole rights to him, just enough to be able to make medical decisions for him when she is too busy to bother caring for her child. You're putting him first.  She's putting herself first\n\nDon't feel bad about this ONE BIT. You've done nothing wrong and everything right", "NTA\n\nHolding her hostage? No honey you had a kid.

The second the parent is unavailable when something goes wrong, I would never watch that kid again. NTA stop letting her take advantage of you.

It gives you the legal ability to make medical decisions but does not give you custody or parental rights over the child.\n\n\"When Is a Power of Attorney for a Child Needed?\n\nAs long as a parent (or guardian) is available, there is no need for a power of attorney for your child. However, if neither parent is available to do things such as sign a medical consent form, another adult can be authorized to do so with a document commonly called a power of attorney for child or power of attorney for minor child.\n\nThis is typically done when parents are going out of town (for vacation, work, military deployment, etc.) and will be leaving a child with friends or relatives, or when a child is being sent out of town to live with friends or relatives.\n\nA power of attorney for child gives the designated agent the temporary authority to make decisions, but the parent still retains the same authority. In a guardianship, the parental authority is permanently transferred to the legal guardian, and the parent no longer has the authority to make decisions for the child. A parent may revoke a power of attorney at any time, but only a court can change guardianship.\"", "How do I give someone all rights to make magical decisions for ME?", "This is exactly what I thought!

This is a situation that can turn ugly fast.", "NTA. It feels like your generosity is being taken advantage of. Your friend is sacrificing her child and his well-being to visit her parents who won\u2019t even meet him. I get seeing her siblings but seriously??? You should have medical rights at very least and what would happen should something tragic happen to her?? The family certainly won\u2019t take him, you have no power to say where he goes!? This all just seems like either she needs to place him for adoption and go back home to her family to rekindle what she seems to not want to part with for the sake of her own child, or make a choice to end contact with family that is not being supportive and carry on with her adult life with her child. What would she do? Keep visiting her family for the rest of her life leaving her son elsewhere??", "The idea of leaving my baby overnight at that age is hard for me to comprehend. Leaving for an entire weekend to spend time with someone that doesn\u2019t want him to exist? Not anxiously checking my phone every 20 minutes but instead ignoring it for 6 hour and then taking another 3 to get to the hospital?? I just can\u2019t comprehend any of this. Some have suggested that maybe she\u2019s out partying and going out to do drugs is about the only thing that makes this make sense. Something has to be altering her mind. NTA. Honestly I\u2019d want to call CPS. This is not okay.", "NTA. I\u2019d talk to a family law attorney about your situation. Clearly, she longs for the connection she had with her family, and it\u2019s possible that you can find a middle ground which would provide you with the right to make medical or administrative decisions on A\u2019s behalf. It wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean she\u2019s giving up her baby (she may be working to get her family to accept him), but it would allow you to continue to be gracious enough to care for this boy without a gap in his care.", "Info: Are you sure she's actually visiting her family? She could be lying to you and doing anything... drugs were my first thought.", "Honey, she ain\u2019t spending all that time with her fam. She\u2019s out partying and playing with boys again", "ESH That escalated quickly. You don\u2019t need legal rights to your friend\u2019s kid, but you do need to set up boundaries. Do not babysit until she shapes up. Honestly, you should give her a move out date.", "NTA. I'm surprised the hospital didn't call CPS when it became clear mom wasn't responding after the baby had been in the hospital for hours. It's just a matter of time before CPS becomes aware of neglect by the mom.", "You can find them online. For a minor you may need to search a little, but there is a basic legal format that can work from state to state. I had one for an adult who had moved since setting it up and it was fine in the next state.", "THe sad thing is that the baby is likely as bonded to OP as to his Mom.", "Agreed. Even if her parents don't want anything to do with the baby, I have a VERY hard time believing that they wouldn't have pushed her out the door immediately or even driven her to the hospital if they knew her child was sick. I'm leaning towards maybe visiting her family and then staying over with some random guy.\n\nIf she is leaving the baby with you tomorrow, type of a medical power of attorney tonight granting you full authority to make medical decisions for the baby. Try to get it notarized or get witness signatures if possible. Make sure to have a photo copy of her medical insurance card and keep the car seat. I would also insist that she keep her phone on her and on at all times so you can reach her in the event of an emergency and remind her that the hospital WILL call CPS at some point if she can not be reached.", "It's super weird to expect someone to look after your infant without asking first. If her child gets injured and she can't be reached (like in this situation) but OP doesn't have any guardianship over the child, something terrible might happen like CPS being called on behalf of the hospital.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "Not sign away her rights. Allow legally OP to make medical decisions on his behalf. A friend of mine is raising her friend\u2019s kid, if she didn\u2019t have that legal piece of paper that Mom says this woman can also be Mom in specific ways, that will allow OP to be useful and hell keep this baby alive. Unlike the mother who didn\u2019t care her kid was in the hospital. OP is NTA.", "Wow", "I actually missed that piece, but yeah I completely agree.", "I\u2019m thinking that there is another factor here:\n\nNew boyfriend. Doesn\u2019t want to date anyone with kids.", "Or there is no reconciliation with the parents. Instead she is spending the weekend partying, meeting guys, getting drunk. The whole parents thing is a cover for getting OP to babysit for free.\n\nNo other reason for not answering your phone for 6 hours, and then taking 3 hours to get to the hospital. She was probably drunk or high, or having sexy time with a dude with the phone off.", "Or she\u2019s already found that person, and is spending weekends with them while she\u2019s allegedly at her parents (who don\u2019t exactly sound like the forgiving type anyway)", "Agreed. CPS should 100% be involved.", "Wow is right. Who tf just says \u201chey give me guardianship of your kid\u201d???", "Or, you know, giving OP a medical power of attorney so he actually has the ability to help with care and treatment of the kiddo.", "The codicil in the will!!!\ud83c\udf3b\ud83c\udf3c\ud83c\udf38\ud83c\udf3a", "I really wonder if she is truly visiting family or at least not every time. She could have been with a boyfriend when baby was in the hospital", "I don't even know why she's bothering to keep him if she's so willing to sacrifice him for her toxic parents.", "And he\u2019s only six months old so it\u2019s not even developmentally good for him to be away from his parent for more than like few hours!", "Bingo! She is not visiting and staying weekends with her family. She is partying and/or has a bf who doesn't know she has a kid. She is a shit parent and shit friend.", "This is exactly what I think is happening.", "Especially since it sounds like even at 30 years old, mom and dad were paying alot of her bills.", "My first thought too, lol.", "I think family. When you\u2019ve been cut off like that it HURTS. I could see her being desperate to have that feeling of belonging and family again, the problem is it\u2019s coming at the expense of her child", "I\u2019d be highly suspicious that that\u2019s the case - but either way, the \u2018friend\u2019 is shamelessly using OP.", "So glad I wasn't the only one!"]}
