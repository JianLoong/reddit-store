While I was pregnant and a few months before our wedding, the day came, I got a call from a cop that my husband was pulled over and he was over the BACL.

Not a problem since I normally would do that anyway, and I would never let him go without something he needs. However, he asked me to buy him Bronkaid.

I wasn\u2019t a fan of this when it started a few weeks ago, but ultimately I can\u2019t tell him what to buy or take into his own body. When he asked me to buy it for him, which I would have to use my license to buy, I said no, because (feel free to research) bronkaid has some serious, even deadly side effects when used long term or used when you already have high blood pressure (he does) as it elevates your blood pressure. I stated that I was drawing a boundary and did not feel comfortable using my license to purchase it and did not want to enable him to take something that could be so harmful to him, and wasn\u2019t necessary. However, I did buy him coffees to take to work instead to help him stay awake. \n\nHe accused me of being controlling and said it wasn\u2019t right for me to not do him this favor and hang him not having a license over his head.
