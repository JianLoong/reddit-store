I think that significantly reduces the ick factor of that situation. Still a shitty joke to make? Yes. But not in quite the same way IMO.\n\nI will say this: NAH. You are NTA for not consulting your wife, as you state in many comments that there is no expectation for consultation and you did not realize it might bother her. She is also NTA for trying to communicate now that she wishes you'd talked to her about it (although personally I think she is leaning a little into asshole territory with the way she speaks about it, I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt as we only have your perspective on the situation).\n\nHowever.\n\nYWBTA if you don't talk to her *now*, and listen to why she is uncomfortable with this situation.
