Because I cannot imagine making a weekly $22.50 expenditure an issue requiring her input.  Seriously, does she ask your permission before buying new a new pair of jeans or shoes?  When you start doing the nickel-and-dime dance with your partner, there is something else going on under the surface.\n\n(For any math-challenged out there - $45 every two weeks is the equivalent of $22.50 a week.)", "Paying this person to go to yr home \"wash yr car\" twice a month and yr wife \"found\" out so you tell her she is being ridiculous for feeling something is up with the situation. Where was yr wife that she didn't know this was happening? Was she working? You have a joint account but she wasn't informed.......you wish you could see yr friend in a bikini.......yeah yta here.", "INFO:  How much are you paying your friend and what is she wearing?", "YTA\nAnd the bikini comment. Gross.", "Yes. YTA", "Lmao. This is the response that will make you the AH. LOL. Good luck!", "This! This comment right here tells me that your wife is justified in feeling the way she does. \n\nWithout a doubt YTA. \n\nWash your own damn car.", "OP is being weird and creepy about this, but if one of my good male friends was washing my car on the reg I would 100% make a joke about them doing it in a bikini, and we\u2019d both probably have a laugh about it.\n\nBut making that joke about a lady friend wearing one, while knowing my fianc\u00e9e was feeling insecure about it, would not be ok at all.\n\nIf I was in OPs spot, with a wife not feeling ok about the situation, I would never make that joke. Not cool.", "But will you wear a bikini?", "I make my kids clean my car every week (which is mostly taking out all the items they leave in there!). They do a shitty job of vacuuming though.", "Only if snacks are included", "It\u2019s even *worse* that you will ONLY make the joke behind your wife\u2019s back.", "I don't know...sounds a bit much. Lol, I get the intention, but that's just a bit much.", "I'm sorry about the loss of your creature! She sounds lovely.", "Good good", "This depends, tbh. I used to get mine done every 2 weeks before kids..along with my toes."]}
