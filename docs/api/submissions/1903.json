Your insurance probably won't cover your car if it is used for deliveries and he would not be a covered driver. Hide your keys.", "NTA. He is **stealing** your car. Your insurance will most likely not cover this.

It is not your fault he f-ed up and didn't pay his car payments.  Any time he takes your car start reporting him to the cops.\n\n\n I would  be nice the first time... do a group ( you, him,, any other siblings, parents, ect) saying if he doesn't return your car, that he didn't  ask permission to use, that you were calling the cops and reported it stolen.    State you have been lenient up until now. But it's not your responsibility to let him 'borrow' your car... \n\nThis is his only warning. \n\n\nWhy a group text?   More often people reply to them and not pay attention that it's a group text.
