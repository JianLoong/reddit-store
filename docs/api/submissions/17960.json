All of them except for the iman's family drink alcohol.    But if you ask them, they will identify as Muslim.  So you certainly can't assume what people will eat or not.

By your logic you would need to disclose every ingredient in the dumpling:\nEgg, green onion, pork, flour, msg, soy, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, cabbage, who knows what else. \n\nWhen you offer someone food, do you always make sure to tell them every single ingredient? No? because that's stupid. \n\n\nIf a person has sensitivities/etc., they should always be cautious. I have met people who are dumb enough to order something like a dumpling and not even know/care what kind of meat is in it.

(Also I have heard from Muslim scholars that Allah won't punish a Muslim who unknowingly ate pork, or was tricked into eating it.)\n\nPersonal responsibility is key here. It's always kind to be looking out for others and if you can, do so. But people have much more on their plates and on their minds than to be worrying about every single ingredient in the food they consume and how it might affect others if they're kind enough to offer it to someone else. \n\nYou're being extremely obtuse about someone just trying to be kind. \n\ntl;dr \nIf someone offers you food and you have an ingredient you can't eat, it's your responsibility to say, \"Oh thank you!

The second the word \u201cPork\u201d came out of your mouth, she was probably freaking out. Basically she has just had something that has been forbidden her whole life.

Sometimes when someone does something wrong, they tend to try and make it anyone\u2019s fault except for them.\n\nI\u2019m in no way excusing her behavior because I 100% agree with all of the advice you\u2019ve been given - it was definitely her responsibility to ask Before eating!

Personal responsibility IS key here but again I\u2019ve never disputed that. \n\nWhat part of my logic dictates that you\u2019d have to list everything?

If it\u2019s not a formal occasion with new people, Im not putting that much thought into how I offer up my food.
