It was held at a hotel and we had shuttles to and from the event and dinner. There were roughly 60-70 people. \n\nWe started the event at 11am and dinner concluded at 10:30pm. Up to that point we had an amazing time I even set up a meeting with a new potential customer. Then, there was some talk about going to a bar afterwards and going around town for a bit. I wrongly followed one of the women I was hanging out with onto the shuttle back to the hotel when she told me she was also going to the bars. When we got back to the hotel (15 minute ride) I realized that some of the group (including my boss and the lady who invited us) had actually walked to the bar from dinner. I thought we\u2019d be going from the hotel. \n\nI texted my boss that at that point I\u2019d just go up to my room and call it a night. It was close to 11pm and we had another important meeting at 9am with a different group that I work very closely with. He was very upset that I didn\u2019t come back out and continue to party with everyone. I think he feels I didn\u2019t do my job by keep going as long as the person who invited us wanted to stay out. I feel that I did what was best for me to perform the next day, but I may have let the customer down.", "created_utc": 1701862105, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18c1ynu/aita_for_going_to_bed_early_during_a_business_trip/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
