Now this family member is known to jump around to a new position about every year or so. So I asked them if they were sure that the wanted it as I would have to go to a new department if they took it. They assured me that they would. I changed departments and in 6-9 months they had changed positions again (and proceeded to change multiple times since whether they were promotions or demotions). About 9 months ago they told me that they had applied for and accepted a position at the same place that would not allows them to have a family member work at the same location.

They were told that I either have to move to a different location or they will have to step down by the end of the week and have a month to find another position.

It appears that that isn\u2019t the case as today they said that THEY would have to step down by the end of the week and THEY had to find a new position by the end of the month.\n\nI have a very complicated relationship with this person and I just always seem to be made out to be the bad guy.

That went well beyond anything they might have done regarding your employment there in the first place:  whatever they may have done in your hiring, **you** are the one whose work has kept you on the job.  You owe them nothing, and maintaining that you want to keep your current position is a healthy boundary that requires ***no*** explanation.\n\n\"Hi, I want to you to get out of my way!\"\n\n\"Nope; I'm sure with all your experience, you'll have no problem finding an even better job.\"\n\n*Their* violation of company policy was entirely their conscious choice and now their responsibility to deal with the consequences.

Are they going to just keep moving to your place of work and displacing you? Like you said, you have bills to pay.
