Did call him out on it cause it wasn\u2019t cool, better say it in her face than do it behind her back to his friends when he thinks I\u2019m not listening. \n\nShe recently asked me, knowing that I\u2019m brutally honest, I told her that she did get a lot bigger and that she should start caring more about herself as it is affecting her physical health, told her to hit the gym more often and stop eating crap. She snapped at me and started crying, saying that it was rude and mean, and that she doesn\u2019t have enough time for the gym with a nine month child and a three year old running around. \n\nI get how I\u2019d be an AH if she didn\u2019t ask me, but she did and gave her my honest opinion AITA for being truthful?", "created_utc": 1677349281, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11brrj6/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_gained_a_lot_of/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Fair. She didn\u2019t ask you to critique her lifestyle or insult her. You assume she\u2019s stopped caring for herself. The woman just gave birth. That affects their bodies and hormones in such strange ways. It takes MONTHS to normalize, and even then it\u2019s never quite like before. Telling her that she needs to care more is just a slap in the face. Obviously she cares or she wouldn\u2019t ask!", "You say you're brutally honest but where is your kind honesty? Or your considerate honesty? \nBrutal honesty usually means \"I want to be an asshole but hide under the guise of honesty\"\n\nThere were so many ways you could have reacted like \"Yeah, you gained weight but you also grew an entire person and don't get a lot of time to take care of yourself with two little ones.

In which case you're fine.\n\nI don't understand why people ask this though.  Look in a mirror, get on a scale. . you already know you've gained a ton of weight, why bother asking?", "OP she knows that she gained more weight than normal with the 2nd birth and she prefaced the question with \"your honest opinion\" people in denial will always do that.  You should have just turned the tables on her and asked her if she felt she gained more weight than normal.  If she admitted it to herself, then she would have been more open about it, but because you were brutally honest with her it was demeaning and hurtful.  She has to answer the question why she's having \"breathing difficulties,\" etc. and accept she has problems, just like an alcoholic has to admit they have a problem before they can get help.", "Read the comments and decided to say YTA.

Its for me not message itself but the way you tell it.  Something like lines of \"Its normal to gain weight from giving birth, if you would like to go to the gym i can watch/feed the baby while you have something els on your mind\".

You could\u2019ve been nicer about this, she gave birth to two children and that can be a lot for a body. Also brutally honest is just a nicer way of saying that you\u2019re an AH.", "YTA.

Also have you considered helping by watching the kids or going with her to gym or even just walkes around the neighborhood?", "YTA- being honest and being mean are different things. You can be honest and say \u201cyeah, you put on some weight, but it\u2019s to be expected and motherhood looks wonderful on you.

You could have given an honest answer\u2026 not a cruel one.", "YTA \u2014 not because you said she gained weight in response to her asking if she did, but because of all the other stuff you said. I\u2019m not sure what tone of voice you used when you told her (sympathetic and helpful or abrupt and know-it-all, leaning towards the second based off some of the words you used), but even if you were sympathetic, people don\u2019t always want unsolicited advice. Especially when it comes to weight, something people generally get very self conscious about. \n\nI also want to give a warning, being \u201cbrutally honest\u201d isn\u2019t always a good thing. Learning to be cautious and respectful when speaking with other people (doesn\u2019t mean you have to lie!) will get you much further in life. When confronted with \u201cbrutal honesty,\u201d people tend to get defensive and argumentative, and it can change someone\u2019s opinion of you.

Instead of \u201cstop eating crap,\u201d you could actually discuss her diet and make easier suggestions, like try to drink water instead of snacking or buying more fruit. \n\nBeing brutally honest does help people, it just makes you feel superior.

What is she really asking you since she already knows the answer to this question? She's probably asking \"am I still attractive? Do I still look good?\" In that context, your response was not \"brutal honesty,\" because their is no objectively true answer. There is only the subjective truth that you think she looks like she is unhealthy and failing to care for herself. Both of those things may be true, but the way you said them was just mean. If you can't be helpful, be quiet and let someone else help.", "Soft YTA, not for being honest but for potentially delivering it in an unkind way.  My two cents for what little it\u2019s worth (in case you have future conversations with her).  Women\u2019s metabolism and hormones are very different in the postpartum period.  Some \u201cbounce back\u201d very quickly while others don\u2019t.  It\u2019s okay.  My wife took a few years to get into a new routine, given the huge change to our eating, sleeping and exercise with the little ones.  Turning 40 for us didn\u2019t help.  It\u2019s okay.

Did call him out on it cause it wasn\u2019t cool, better say it in her face than do it behind her back to his friends when he thinks I\u2019m not listening. \n\nShe recently asked me, knowing that I\u2019m brutally honest, I told her that she did get a lot bigger and that she should start caring more about herself as it is affecting her physical health, told her to hit the gym more often and stop eating crap. She snapped at me and started crying, saying that it was rude and mean, and that she doesn\u2019t have enough time for the gym with a nine month child and a three year old running around. \n\nI get how I\u2019d be an AH if she didn\u2019t ask me, but she did and gave her my honest opinion AITA for being truthful?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", " 1. its only been a couple months 2. idk i dont have a child but i imagine taking care of a newborn and a 3 year old is very tiring and time consuming and doesnt leave a lot of time or energy for working out/ taking care of herself 4. her hormones might still be kind of funky and rebalancing themselves so she might be more sensitive 5. its really normal for a womans body to change after pregnancy. i think unless you know you have like the resources to have a personal trainer/surgery/idk what else you need to expect that chances are you wont get it to be exactly the same as before pregnancy.\n\ni think a better way to go about it is if you can (idk your proximity/scheduling) offer to come over once a week and make a healthy dinner or help her meal prep some healthy snacks for herself. maybe you and your parents can go on rotation to watch the kids a couple days a week so she can work out or go for a walk or something. like just outrightly saying yea you gained weight  isnt productive for anyone. i dont see the point in lying but be nice about it and offering help and support would've been a better way to approach it.", "Yeah, she asked but Jesus, you didn\u2019t have to say it that way. YTA", "YTA for your delivery. Postpartum is extremely difficult as is. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s exhausted, spread thin and probably doesn\u2019t get much time to think about herself. You\u2019re not the asshole for responding to her question and saying she has gained weight but it was rude to tell her to stop eating crap and hit the gym. Women\u2019s hormones are vastly different during the postpartum period. There are also tons of women who struggle with things like thyroid issues post birth. Instead of being supportive and understanding of her insecurity, you made her feel worse.", "YTA for how you answered the question- you could\u2019ve left it at yes she gained weight, but the eating crap and care about physical health parts were unnecessary. Her husband is also an a-hole; we women go through so much to have babies, and the men just turn around and have the nerve to lose attraction to us after carrying and birthing their babies. Gets me so annoyed.", "yta. womens body takes 2 years to heal and get even close to body and mental state she was before birth.", "Ugh I would... but I don't want to get down voted out the ass", "INFO\n\nTell us the difference between being honest and brutally honest.", "If sister asked you \"hey, have I gained weight?\" and you said \"sure, you've gained some, you just had a baby\", you would not be an AH. Reporting a factual statement to someone who asked for it is not being a dick. There are ways you can talk about weight without being rude or insulting or unkind.\n\nYou didn't do that though! What you actually did was:\n\n>I told her that she did get a lot bigger and that she should start caring more about herself as it is affecting her physical health, told her to hit the gym more often and stop eating crap\n\nWhich was you just laying into her aggressively. You're not \"being brutally honest\", you berated her, and like \"I'm just honest\" people love to do, you're throwing your hands up and going \"wow, could I have been a jerk for *telling the truth*?\" rather than considering \"could I have been massively rude about HOW I said something?\". YTA.", "i\u2019m actually going to disagree with a lot of people here, and say NTA. i definitely understand you should generally never ever say that you are fat (or anything negative appearance wise), however in your situation she had been constantly asking you and very clearly wanted an honest answer. So you simply saying she had gained weight isn\u2019t inherently making you an asshole, however i\u2019m sure there are ways of answering her questions in the nicest possible way. imho she asked and if you ask you need to be ready for a response", "NTA Here is why. She knows you well enough to understand your brutal honesty. Yes it still hurt her feelings but she knew how you would answer. She is feeling bad about herself and now she basically threw you under the bus because the family will be mad at how you answered. They also know you well enough to understand that is what you would say.", "YTA\n\nOK so when is she supposed to hit the gym, if her husband is working and she's the sahm, as I'm guessing nearly everything falls on her. Has anyone actually offered to give her a break so that she can get herself better.\n\nThrowing out ideas but no solutions just makes you an AH", "NTA, don ask questions of people when you know the answer and arent going to give you what you want to hear. OP is not the warm cuddly person. brutally honest people tend to give AH responses. you dont ask that person if you gained weight. they arent going to lie to you. dont seek affirmation in palces you know youre not going to receive it.", "YTA. You saying to her to go hit the gym and change her \u2018shitty\u2019 eating style is absolutely insane, you already know shes self-conscious about her appearance after gaining weight due to pregnancy but what makes you entitled to say all that? You could of put it more nicely, and being brutally honest doesn\u2019t mean you get to be an asshole about someone\u2019s appearance.", "If you want to help her, find out of there's any \"mom and baby\" fitness classes locally, or offer to min her kids so she can have time for herself.", "NTA for being honest but YTA for delivery.", "ESH", "People saying he was cruel must have paper thin skin. NTA", "Nta. Why are people expected to lie when someone asks them point blank about their thoughts on their weight. The sister has asked multiple people their opinions so she\u2019s either fishing for compliments or knows she\u2019s gotten bigger. Sometimes people need a wake up call. Especially if they secretly know the truth about themselves. Lying to her isn\u2019t going to make things better.", "I thought the same thing about the husband. She just gave birth to your child, douchebag ! The OP could have worded it differently, as well. Yes, she's heavier fine.. how about offering some encouragement or ways to help. She went too far, imo.", "I'm pretty sure the OP doesn't have enough knowledge or insight, to understand the difference", "She grew 2 humans, very close in age.", "The bot doesn\u2019t understand \u201cYATH\u201d to my knowledge. You need to put YTA or it doesn\u2019t count.", "Exactly this!", "This. \n\nYou can be honest and supportive. Or you can be honest and blame/shame/judge. Which is what you did and why YTA.", "This is such a nicer way of framing that statement!", "It sounds like the husband isn\u2019t doing much. Instead of him complaining to his friends about his attraction towards his wife, maybe he should be doing the above. \n\nIf she didn\u2019t want an honest answer then she needs to stop asking everyone.", "It\u2019s her brother, not partner. For all we know the brother lives hours away. Also, in no way is any of that the brother\u2019s responsibility. Now what OP said was in an ass-holish way, but the sister did ask for his opinion. Now because he said that he does not have to cook her meals, watch her kids, make an exercise plan for her\u2026", "This right here \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46", "Since when is that his responsibility? It\u2019s not his kid", "Apparently she doesn't because she's been going around asking people for 9 months if she's fat and then asking some more. NTA. Don't ask questions you don't want answers to.", "Oh, come on. An \"inkling\"? Are you freaking serious? Sister lives in her own damned body. She KNOWS she weighs more. She's not looking for motivation, especially from OP, who we know is always \"brutally honest\".", "Lol. What does it mean to have an \"inkling\" about gaining weight? Does she not have eyes? Does she not own old clothes? Is the concept of a scale unfamiliar to her?\n\nShe knows very well she gained weight, and she's miserable about it but got sick of dealing with it herself and wants to externalize it and take it out on other unfortunate owners of eyes. OP took her bait and she took it out on OP, though a punching bag in the gym would have been more productive.\n\nOP is NTA. This woman sounds like she's been insufferable about this, and needs to either 1) decide the weight is unacceptable and work to lose it 2) decide its acceptable/cost of doing business, but she doesn't get to take it out on others, then. OP didn't shove a feeding tube down her throat, and \"eating for two\" is an idiom, not advice.", "Was it necessary to imply she had stopped caring about her health and was just lazy? The woman gave birth two months ago. It takes weeks just to finish healing.", "Agreed. Sister knew she gained weight and basically wanted everyone to convince her that she didn't. It's ok to gain weight during/after pregnancy, but I don't think it's good to be delusional about it, especially if it's affecting your health. General rule of thumb, don't ask questions you don't want answered.", "You honestly believe she doesn't know, and needs a wake up call??", "YTA. She knows she gained weight. She\u2019s not blind. But she needed some support from someone she thought would respond in a way that would indicate some basic level of sensitivity", "He\u2019s involved just got a very busy schedule and tough job while she\u2019s a stay at home mother", "yeah, you can be 50 or 100 pounds overweight and not expect to have breathing problems at a young age. It sounds like she\u2019s dangerously overweight.", "Because she's not obese. She just had a baby and surprise surprise, it's completely normal to gain weight during pregnancy and it takes some time to lose that weight.", "It\u2019s because the pharmaceutical companies want to keep selling their drugs and making money over it.\nI don\u2019t think OP was in the right to say that so harshly. There are nicer ways to say things to people especially your family.", "Huh?", "Thanks man", "thank you so much for telling me! i didnt know!", "Nah, if he's going to offer his opinions on how she can supposedly improve her weight, then he's going to help her with them.", "Then he doesn't need to comment on his sister's body", "OP said she constantly asked. Sometimes people need honesty. I didn\u2019t take OP as implying that she is lazy. She said that her health is being physically affected, and she needs to stop eating crap.", "Yeah and it\u2019s so hard to find time to even shower let alone go to the gym when you have a new baby.", "She gave birth 9 months ago per the post. Plenty of time to heal.", "Which is not a tough job, right? Being a stay at home mother is a cake walk?", "So both parents have hard jobs, but his job has a beginning and an end each day, and hers is 24/7.", "What if he offered the advice in a polite way, and gave constructive criticism, rendering him Not the A-hole. In your mind, is he still responsible for basically managing her weight loss journey?", "She quite literally asked for his comment. His delivery could\u2019ve been better, she still asked his opinion.", "Honesty and respect can go together. This is a case of someone being mean and then saying \u201cI\u2019m just being honest.\u201d You can be honest without being hurtful. There\u2019s a difference between someone being hurt by the truth and someone being hurtful with the truth.", "Very first line says \u201ca couple of months ago.\u201d It says a 9-month old child later so OP is as bad at writing as he is being tactful. There was still not reason to be insulting. A simple \u201cI had noticed you\u2019d put on some weight, yea,\u201d would have sufficed.", "Heal from the physical wound of birth is one thing...but what about all the stress of caring for an infant and a toddler? She is probably not even getting sleep", "A comment saying she's overweight would have been fine, but no he had to be \"brutally honest\" to the point that he made her cry. I bet that he considers this a hallmark of his personality too", "Amen,  too many AH hide behind \"I just speak my mind and tell the truth\".   My SIL would add \"I don't care if it hurts peoples feelings,  I like to speak my mind\".", "Plus some people actually gain weight when they breastfeed because their body hangs onto every caloric resource it can in case of famine. My body did that both times and I finally lost the weight after I weaned.", "The way he answered the question SHE asked still doesn\u2019t make anything you listed his responsibility?", "Excellent point, she may be breastfeeding.  OP is even more TA now."]}
