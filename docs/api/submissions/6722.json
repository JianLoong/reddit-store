We were joking about the passive aggressive mum meme when he was out of the room. When he came back, I was trying to include him in the situation. I asked him if he's seen the meme. He snapped \"MY MUM IS AN ABUSIVE NARCISSIST\". He stormed out the room and ignored me for the rest of the day. I tried messaging so I could apologize but no response. At work if I saw him, I said hello to test the waters and he huffed at me and walked away. It's been over a month and every time I walk past him, I get an eye roll or some rude behaviour.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCut to a few days ago. So he is still chatting away with everyone else but I have no included myself in conversation since because I get daggers from him. Another person I'm friendly with in the group, we will call B, always mentions him to me about things they do outside of work. Because we work in the same team, I said just be careful not to get on his bad side, he can be vindictive. I then go home and see a paragraph from A.

He should unpack his trauma and problems in therapy, not in his workplace.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong in your initial interaction. He won\u2019t even talk to you to let you apologize. Just ignore him as best you can. The one place you messed up is warning your coworker about him. From now on just be a duck at work. Let it all roll off your back. Nothing bothers you regarding him. You have absolutely nothing to say about him, good, bad, or indifferent, unless it\u2019s necessary for work purposes. Vent about him with other friends or family if necessary.", "NTA - Work is not the time nor place to bring up past trauma. \nWhether he realizes it or not, it makes others uncomfortable in what seems like a pretty relaxed atmosphere. \nDude, save it for your therapist.", "NTA. Sometimes in life you'll have to deal with people who try to make everything about them and it's better to give them as little brain processing time as possible.", "NTA. This is a workplace, not a therapy session, leave your past traumas behind when you go to work, or at least don't bring them up to coworkers. Most people have bad things that happened to them in the past, but to get triggered by conversation and fly off the handle? That's just childish and weird. Expecting everyone to walk on eggshells around you is entitled. You did nothing wrong and honestly I'd probably just ignore this person going forward, you wouldn't want to accidentally say the wrong thing again and have them yell at you over it.", "NTA.   Some people just are miserable assholes sucking the air out of a space.", "You\u2019re NTA here. You\u2019ve tried your best to civil the rest is up to them xx", "He\u2019s just a drama queen", "He\u2019s been triggered and overreacted - the only thing to do is to be civil and just discuss work with him and not engage in personal conversations. You don\u2019t know what may trigger so it\u2019s best to avoid joking around him. If the trauma talk continues it might be worth going to HR and asking if there any counselling that can be paid for by work as it is affecting the work environment", "NTA. \n\nYou tried including him in a conversation but it triggered him yet he also trauma dumps every second imaginable. I would get HR involved. Chatting about life at work is one thing, but him trauma dumping isn't appropriate in the workplace, that's for the therapist. \n\nAs for apologizing, I don't see any reason you need to. You didn't do anything to purposely offend him or set him off. He's old enough to know how to response to things that trigger him.", "INFO: wondering what was said to include him in the conversation about mothers.", "Info: This whole post feelings like it's missing information. Did you have any interactions like this before he stopped speaking to you?", "NTA. He needs to stop trauma dumping and making it other people\u2019s problems. Everyone deals with shit in their life and it\u2019s nobody\u2019s issue but your own to fix- I\u2019m a major case in point. He overreacted and you did nothing wrong. They need professional help. I wouldn\u2019t talk to your other supposed \u201cfriend\u201d either because they clearly went running their mouth. I honestly would go to HR and make not of the interaction as they are now creating a hostile work environment.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n>He talks a hundred miles an hour and sometimes is a little harsh when he thinks he is being funny\n\n>He also has a habit of bringing up past trauma, unprovoked, mid conversation\n\n>He stormed out the room and ignored me for the rest of the day.

But, given what you've shared, I say NTA. You guys weren't doing anything hurtful or harmful. At least not intentionally. And you did try to include him in the fun. It's not like you were leaving him out of anything. His reaction seems a bit strong for the circumstance. So, again, I have to wonder if there was more to it. But, with what you've given us, to answer your question: No you're NTA for just joking about a meme that you tried to include him in.", "NTA he sounds like someone who looks for reasons to be offended", "NTA - All you did was ask them about a meme! Your co-worker needs some help if *that* triggered his past trauma. I'm sorry for anything he went through, but the meme you were discussing/brought up had nothing to do with his situation with his mom. You had no way of knowing anything about what happened in his past, and he had no right to get upset with you.", "NTA\n\nno comment though i dont see why him being trans has anything to do with the story, you didnt need to mention that lol", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
