It\u2019s gross that she believes him being available means he is available to her. He\u2019s not a piece of meat on the market. \nShe has a grotesquely inflated ego and anyone who prides themselves on \u201cnever being rejected\u201d needs to aim higher in life in terms of achievements, what does she want a badge? Oh and getting \u201caccepted\u201d by men does not mean all of them respected her for the right reasons. \n\nShe displays a distinct lack of empathy in regards to your heart ache and pain, I mean it when I say that the thought of being with one of my best friends men has never ever entered my mind, the relationship I had with my best friend was so strong that it honestly would of felt damn near incest to be with anyone she had been with or loved. \n\nTrust me for all her weeping and whinging she is revelling in the fact she now has an excuse for her shitty behaviour as is totally using it as an \u201cin\u201d with your ex.\n\nBe prepared as much as you have an understanding when it comes to your ex and his preferences, sometimes people surprise you by doing the exact opposite, they may well end up together but honestly? I think at most it\u2019ll just be for sex in his eyes most likely. I know that stung to read but that\u2019s IF he gives her the time of day he very well may not but it\u2019s much better to be prepared because she sounds feral in her pursuit to be honest.\n\nNo matter what happens, one day you will look back on all of it and when you\u2019re in a better place you\u2019ll see it all as a learning curve in life and you\u2019ll no longer care either way, you dodged a bullet with her, sooner the better. \n\nNTA \u2764\ufe0f", "I know you wanted a clean break, but give him a heads up about her, I don't know if she is nefarious enough to try anything, but if she's sketchy, he should know. Would she try to rope him in somehow?", "She\u2019s not a friend OP. NTA", "Fuck that, if plastic fantastic has no qualms about trampling all over your feelings and the bro code then fuck her, would be dead to me.", "> she started laughing and said she has never been rejected before\n\nI've known women who make this claim or \"I can get any man I want\". In their version, any man who doesn't fall for her bullshit isn't a man who rejected her, he's magically just a man she didn't want anyway.", "Oh dude no. The most beautiful women I know are insecure AF", "I mean, the fact that you know for sure that your ex won't date her is weird. It sounds very judgemental to me, especially if the reason is her cosmetic surgeries. Some people are fine with it, but calling them fake boobs and fake lips are very rude comments. I'm not sure I believe that you loved this girl based on these comments", "She will go after him with a vengeance just to spite you and she is good looking per your report.  You are an ex, they tend not to accurately know a guys type (many of us don't really have one).  I don't think he will marry her though.", "Thank you\ud83d\ude2d", "And especially if they evidently are NOT over it.", "Has this woman ever thought about what she\u2019ll have to offer when looks fade as they inevitably do because she seems to bank everything on her appearance. She also thinks her looks are everyone\u2019s taste and she\u2019d be wrong to delude herself so. She sounds shallow, vacuous and a complete bore.", "No you don\u2019t understand her friend wasn\u2019t rich.(relevant)", "People say horrible things to the people they love everyday - but I think OP gets a free pass since her 'friend' revealed herself to be a snake. The moment the words came out of her mouth her true colours were shown. She wasn't doing it out of anger, she was speaking her true desires out loud - she always had eyes for OPs ex. OP said what she said from a place of hurt and betrayal. Women have said far worse things to each other. That plastic fantastic would've had a much harsher assessment from me and it would have been well deserved.", "Really? Telling somebody that isn't over their ex that you are going to get him and try and date him constantly even when they've asked you not to say it in their pretense doesn't make then an AH?", "The audacity of her to cry and play the victim after she was so cruel to you is astonishing. And fuck your other friends that took up for her.", "After a break up, it is the friends' job to make OP feel better, not worse.  \"He was never good enough for you, he's a jerk, he smells funny\" are all acceptable.  \"is he seeing anyone?\" is absolutely not acceptable.", "She wants kids so prob she\u2019ll project her issues onto them, that\u2019s usually how people like that roll", "Honestly, people can downvote away, but OP seems to be just as shallow as she is accusing her friend of being. Is it bad manners to date a friend's ex? Yes, but the fact that OP discussed it with him to begin with makes me honestly wonder if the things she is saying her friend is might be more of a projection than an observation.", "I wonder if her friends also have had work done. I live in a place where plastic surgery is common and there's almost camaraderie revolved around it (botox parties, etc). Either that or her reaction was stronger, so her friends felt the need to side with her.   \n   \nEither way NTA.", "\"he smells funny\" LOL", "She already gave an explanation in the comments. He\u2019s been very vocal about disliking cosmetic surgery in general\u2026and about not liking how the friend seems to constantly being going after people for their money. OP and her ex have not specifically discussed this friends cosmetic surgeries", "Hm, does she though? If she's that shallow it seems more likely she loves the idea of little toys to take pictures with. She can't even treat you, her friend, like a human being.", "Tell your ex your friend has told you she wants him for his money.  The fact that she would even consider this means she's not a true friend so you shouldn't care if you lose her.  If he would \"choose\" her knowing that, then it should help you get over him pretty quick because that means he only cares about looks.  There's millions of people in the world.", "If he us a nice guy you owe it to him to warn him that she's not a nice person.\n\nIt isnt about stopping them, it's about making sure he knows who she us in case she comes knocking.", "Asking for space has zero to do with warning him, you're making a false correlation.", "Listen to this advice OP!"]}
