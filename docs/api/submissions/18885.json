Your friends are supposed to support you and help you get over him, maybe do a little shit talking about him just so you could get over him. Not immediately start wanting to get with said ex. If she is doing this, then she was no friend in the first place. You were just telling the truth at that point.", "Your friends behavior is disgusting. So is yours. Next time try saying something relevant to why youre upset instead of going for vicious ad hom attacks to someone you claim is your \u201cfriend.\u201d ESH", "NTA. She is shallow and seems to think only looks matter. She is not your friend and you stood up for yourself appropriately. You told her she wasn\u2019t his type and she pressed it.\n\nI hope your heart heals and can eventually find someone who is more aligned with your life goals. Best of luck to you!", "NTA. It was harsh but she also is mean to try and jump him so soon. It doesn't sound like he dumped you. Sounds mutual. You both want different things out of life.", "NTA she\u2019s not your friend. Drop her.", "NTA, don't apologize and cut her out of your life.", "NTA I think she's outrageous to be so blatantly on the prowl for your ex when she knows you're still hurting. It takes a very cold heart and selfishness to do that to a friend. She's not your friend though. Friends don't do that to people they care about. She only cares about herself and getting what she wants. Find better friends hon, cuz she isn't it. And don't apologize.", "YTA. What are fuming for when you broke up. Even if your ex told you he didn't want women with plastic surgeries, he can still choose her (if he comes to love her despite her \"beauty\" and choose her attitudes and manners) just like he chose you even though you have different views on having children.", "NTA I don\u2019t believe an ex is off limits but she knows you still have feelings and it\u2019s still a recent break up. And it\u2019s not like they had a friendship to build on or anything she will just be actively pursuing him.", "NTA. You were a little out of line with the fake lips and tits comment, but she started it.", "[removed]", "This sounds like reality tv tbh. Not sure what to say here", "ESH\u2014your friend sucks for talking about getting with your ex, your other friends suck for backing her up, but you also suck for launching a personal attack on her.  Clearly you guys really aren\u2019t \u201cbest friends\u201d because you have obviously been harboring some resentment towards each other.", "NTA, her trashy ass was due a calling out", "NTA. Was no need for those comments at all. If she was a friend she would know you were hurting still and so would your other friends. Why would she wanna flaunt how she wanted to be with him. She doesn't care and is selfish. Your other friends clearly value her more then you. She knew you were going to be upset when she said that and wanted a easy way out to chase him while having your other friends have her back while she did it. Ditch them all.", "ESH. \n\nYou were cruel and should have responded, \u201cIt really bothers me that you want to date my ex when I would never do that to you. Please don\u2019t mention it again or I will not be able to be friends with you.\u201d \n\nYou\u2019re an adult, communicate your true feelings. And yeah, she sucks too\u2014 but now you\u2019ll never know how she would have responded to an adult conversation about this. Apologize and see what happens.", "NTA but don\u2019t get it twisted, you both aren\u2019t each others friend. You came for her pretty hard in your opinion of her. That being said she was ultimately in the wrong for going after your ex\nAnd actively telling you", "NTA. Act like a bimbo, get treated like one.", "NTA. What a terrible friend \ud83e\udd23 I don't know why you spend time with someone who would be so rude and disrespectful to you when they know you're still emotional over it.", "NTA, she sounds like a horrible friend. She\u2019s been waiting for this moment for way too long", "ESH except the ex. Why are you two even friends, much less best friends, if you care so little about each other?", "NTA. You\u2019re grieving a recent breakup and she\u2019s going on about how she\u2019s never been rejected before? I cannot stand girls like that. I can see that emotions were high and upsetting on your end and you reacted, this girl doesn\u2019t sound like a friend tbh.", "NTA - she wasn\u2019t your friend before and def isn\u2019t your friend now. Friends don\u2019t say shit like that", "NTA\n\nshe\u2019s not your friend", "NTA. She's not a good friend if she wants to date your ex who you have still not moved on from. Moreover she's an AH for mentioning her plans to pursue him infront of you. I could be a little biased here as personally hate people who feel entitled to everything because they had the money/genes to look better than others. You were definitely rude but I don't know what was she expecting rubbing in your face that she could get with ex because she's \"oh so pretty\"", "Nta. She pushed you. I hope your heart heals soon. Break ups SUCK.", "Sounds like shallow friends. I suggest travel and broadening your horizons in arts. Honestly while getting utterly consumed in a passion, the path will lead you to companions with great depths and respect for the common things you enjoy. \n\nThen, these borderline etchings on loyalty and appearances will be unheard of. You'll be surrounded by strong support and people who want you to help them when they see your talents.\n\nAs for the BF, if you guys ever talk again, discuss this with him as lightly as you can. You can use this to see his intentions, but please reveal your own the same. You'll save a lot of time, and you'll have less confusion moving ahead in your journey. Aka less reasons to ask the forum.", "NTA. By the time I was your age, I managed to be at 230 lbs. I had never been rejected until around age 40. She\u2019s still single for a reason, guys like the way you describe your ex don\u2019t go for shallow, cold hearted, fake gold diggers. It wasn\u2019t just a pretty face that I was so well liked, it was a real personality with a legit warm heart. I finally realized why I never got rejected when my youngest child turned out looking exactly like me and I believe she\u2019s beautiful (guys wait in line trying to catch her attention). I always assumed it was my personality alone. But guys want a beautiful person and that comes from the inside so if the outside is beautiful, it\u2019s because the inside shines through. Your \u201cfriend\u201d is still single because her outside beauty sours since she\u2019s ugly on the inside.", "NTA. She was intentional trying to get at you. I suspect that all this time she looked down on you/was jealous of what you had and felt you were undeserving of it. I also these comments were meant to kick you when you are down. I see from your comments that you still think you're in the wrong and that you have ruined your friendship. This woman in her mind probably never considered you a real friend. A real friend would not kick you when you are down and throw salt in your wounds.", "She's not a friend. Friends don't make those kinds of \"jokes\" about people you've been in a relationship. Especially a 4 year relationship. NTA. You'll have a better life without a toxic friend like her. Also, caution to your other friends because she'd probably try the same thing with them. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. You put a disrespectful Barbie in her place. Oh well \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffd", "That woman is not your friend. No real friend will even joke about dating your ex that you're still in love with.  \n\nAnd she's lying about being rejected. Every woman has been rejected regardless of how beautiful she is.  Some women are beautiful but have no personality. \n\n\nNTA", "NTA who needs enemies when you have friends like that?", "[removed]", "NTA. She's not a friend, she's a scab.\n\nYour friends are also not very good friends for defending her after those comments. Call them all out, and cut her off at the very least for disrespecting the friend code", "You're both assholes. She is definitely a major asshole. But you were intentionally hurtful. I understand why you did it, because we have all done something similar when angry, but you did act like an AH in this instance. Your friend, however, is repeatedly letting you know she is about to betray your friendship though--so I don't have much sympathy for her.", "She's making herself out to be a selfish gold digger and I would never be friends with someone like that. Cut her off and never look back. NTA", "You\u2019re NOT TA  you were honest and blunt and honestly she\u2019s NOT your best friend or fiend at all if she isn\u2019t going to consider your feelings on this. Please don\u2019t continue this relationship with her.", "NTA. She got what she deserved. Do not apologize.", "Oh, f**k to the no! She knew exactly what she was doing the first time she hinted at it. She doesn't deserve an apology and your friends need to quit enabling her behavior. Of course she's panicking, she's almost 30 and hasn't landed the rich one yet. That's her problem, not yours.\n\nYour problem is that you still love a man who has different dreams than you. Hopefully you'll either be able to move on soon, or find middle ground with him.\n\nNTA.", "Nta", "NTA\n \nI am sorry that she did that to you but relieved she is out of your life.", "NTA. That\u2019s all on her. She\u2019s a terrible friend.", "NTA. I get that you asked him for space, but you seriously need to contact him to warn him that the gold digging plastic doll will be chasing after him.", "NTA\n\nNone of these people are your friends. \nThat's cruel and f*cked up. You need new friends.", "NTA\n\nShe's not a friend.", "NTA\n\nShe's not your friend and should be treated as such", "NTA, what she said was very insensitive knowing you're not over him. Why would you think you should apologize to a supposed friend who just admitted they would date your ex when she knows you still have feelings for him? If anyone should apologize, it should be her.", "NTA. I really hope they don\u2019t end up together. \ud83e\ude77", "Gtfo her\"friend\" is trying to take her ex and you want her to apologize?

Like most guys will stick their dick into anything, that doesn't make you special lmao. The kind of girls who say stuff like that are always insufferable and single.
