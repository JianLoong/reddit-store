He is the most amazing guy and I love him so much. These past months have been the worst in my life. He is very handsome and successful and rich (relevant). I\u2019m sure he will not have any problems getting into a new relationship.  He broke up with me because we don\u2019t want the same things. He wants children and a family and I don\u2019t. I think we stayed together for so long even though we knew we wanted different, we probably kind of thought we would change or change each other and that love is all it matters. I still love him but I don\u2019t know if he still loves me. When we broke up I asked for a clean break. It means no contact because I needed to get over him. \n\nMy friends know all this and they know how much I love him. One of my best friends, f28, jokingly said that he was up for grabs a month after we broke up. I ignored her. I thought it was a bad joke. She is very beautiful and she basically can get whoever she wants (she always said that she never been rejected before and I believe her). I know my ex didn\u2019t really like her because she  wants a rich guy and because she had done a lot of plastic surgeries. \n\nLast time we had dinner she brought up wanting to date him and one other friend said that we didn\u2019t do that to each other. She laughed it off and I said well you can try. But you are not his type. She said that she never been rejected before and this is where I might have been an AH.

My friends sided with her on this.\n\nI waited until I was in my car to start crying. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH. She knows I still love him and not over him. Couldn\u2019t she wait at least?

The way she dismissed 1. The fact that you still love him 2. The unwritten rule that you don\u2019t date your friends ex and 3. Your polite and tactful comment that she wasn\u2019t his type just shows her true colors. \n\nIf she\u2019s full of herself enough to say that she\u2019s never been rejected, she can stand to be knocked down a couple notches.", "You told her she wasn\u2019t his type (which you shouldn\u2019t ever have had to be in the position to have to tell her that if she was really your friend). She responded that she\u2019s never been rejected before- insinuating that she thinks she is his type, in a very braggedocious way and pointed way- you then clarified what about her makes her not his type since she clearly didn\u2019t get it. Truth hurts. Don\u2019t put yourself on such a high pedestal if you don\u2019t want to come crashing down! You may have been a little bit of TA in the way you delivered the truth, but it wasn\u2019t uncalled for!", "You should keep in mind your friend might be able to get anyone she wants but that doesnt mean they will take her seriously or that she can retain them. Its always funny and slightly sad when i see tik toks of women showing themselves off and confused about how they are so beautiful but still single.

A friend would never want to date your recent ex.", "YTA and should apologize. It's perfectly fine to be upset with your friend for making insensitive comments. It is never okay to make reference to a friend's appearance and history of cosmetic surgery. You also assassinated her character by calling her a gold digger in front of other people. Unacceptable.", "NTA. She knew the context of your relationship with him and was weird for joking about getting with him to begin with. Furthermore, she set herself up to be checked when she kept pressing the fact that she had never been rejected before. I think that you were speaking from a place of frustration and anger when you read her for filth, but she shouldn\u2019t have crossed that boundary if she really cared for you as a friend. I would only say apologize for insulting her choices to do plastic surgery only if you can see yourself rekindling the friendship. otherwise, I firmly believe that she\u2019s not a person that would be good to keep in your circle.", "I mean, if everything else is fake about her, then I'm not sure why you thought she would be a real friend.

Send her my way, I'll gladly reject her and it will hurt because I'm not someone she would ever want, but for someone that far beneath her to reject her would deflate her fake boobs.  She sounds like a trainwreck, but you shouldn't have insulted her.  Let her take her shot and sit back and watch her either get rejected or have the life you refused to accept.", "You sound bitter.
