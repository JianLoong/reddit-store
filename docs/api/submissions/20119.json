I said I wasn\u2019t sure if they were allowing dogs and she said it was ok because he\u2019s a service animal. I said he wasn\u2019t a service animal though and she said yes, he\u2019s an emotional support animal. I said that emotional support animals and service animals are different and service animals are specially trained to perform certain tasks and her dog isn\u2019t. (He\u2019s very sweet, but he\u2019s a nervous little guy and barks a lot) She got really cold and quiet after that and later told me I was being really rude and if I didnt want her to bring her dog I should\u2019ve just said that. I didn\u2019t think I was being rude but I\u2019m autistic so I do tend to struggle in social situations and now I\u2019m wondering if I should\u2019ve just stayed quiet.

Emotional support animals, by LAW, do not have as many rights as service animals.\n\nNTA and she should not lie about her dog.", "NTA. Her dog is not a service animal and people need to stop abusing this.", "NTA\n\nPeople like your friend are ruining it for those who have actual, trained service animals.", "NTA you were just stating facts. There is a pretty substantial difference between an emotional support animal and a service animal, especially if said emotional support animal doesn\u2019t behave well all the time.", "NTA \n\nPeople needs to stop with this fake service dog bullshit", "NTA. Because people abused ESA, the restrictions were increased. It will cause problems for actual SA if these people won't stop.", "NTA at all. The whole Emotional vs service animal issue is very confusing, and you arent the only one that is in this position.. Hell, Airlines/stores etc. are dealing with this issue as wel, not allowing \"emotional support\" animals because from what I have read, there is no \"legal\"/\"official\" definition for \"emotional support\" animals so you did the right thing. Imagine if you both were at a venue which didnt acknowledge a\"emotional support\" animals and then you'd be out money for the event and yeah. You are just looking our for her!", "You are cool. Friend is an entitled A-hole.  \"ESA\" is just a euphemism for pet.   Nobody wants a yappy little mutt at their event. If your friend can't bear to be parted from her little furball for a couple of hours then it is best that she stays home. \n\nToo many people try to take advantage of this jsut so they can bring their pets to places that animals generally are not allowed.", "So by not agreeing and co-signing to her bs you are rude?", "NTA. Either your friend needs to be educated or she is someone who believes in alternate facts.", "NTA. This is absolutely the case. An emotional support animal is NOT a service animal.", "NTA, while animals are great emotional support, maybe people who need emotional support at events should just avoid going to those events altogether. It's not the same if you have a critical condition and your dog is there to save your life, and if you're just an emotional mess and don't want to waste some dollars on dogsitting. could potentially lead to a catastrophe even, if there are other service animals there and that dog can't *behave* (thinks it's another friend dog and tries to play)", "NTA You may be autistic, but your friend believes she's a princess.", "NTA  \nYou didn't even say that *you* didn't want the dog there, you said that you weren't sure if dogs were allowed, which is a fair statement. Your friend has no right to be mad at you, and if she wants to bring her dog, the logical/obvious thing to do is to check if the venue allows animals or not. Plus she should consider if her dog even wants to go to an event. You said her dog is a nervous little guy? Probably not going to be good for the dog to drag him to something that might have a lot of people and be hours long. Is he even going to be able to drink/eat/rest/poop?", "Assuming you're in the USA, emotional support animals are not covered under ADA. They cannot be service animals.  Technically this is correct and this, NTA", "NTA\n\nYou are absolutely right to point out that emotional support animals and service animals are two very very very different things.\n\nThat she finds her dog an emotional support is fine, to be honest most dog lovers do, right? \n\nThat doesn't give her the right to take it into normally dog-free spaces, where the only exception made is for service dogs. \n\nShe is also devaluaing the incredibly important role of service dogs.", "NTA.  Your friend doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about and feels like rules shouldn\u2019t apply to her precious little dog.  \n\nMy step daughter does this too with her medium size dog.  Brings him into grocery stores and restaurants because none of the employees will call her out for that shit.  The dog is very well behaved, so she thinks the laws don\u2019t apply to her.", "Why do people feel they are entitled to bring their dogs everywhere under the guise of 'it's an emotional support animal's it's a pet it's also nervous around people and will ruin the night for others with none stop barking. NTA", "NTA you just shared your opinion", "NTA, you're in the clear on this one. You pointed out something legally factual. \n\nAs an aside my dog was an ESA for several years, and there's no real legal framework that allows for businesses to be sure of even ESA legitimacy, but if you do it right it requires a letter of prescription from a licensed physician. Otherwise, there's no license, markers, or skill requirement for ESAs like service animals have, but a business owner can't legally ask a patron about medical conditions that necessitate the animal either, including psychological issues so an argument about whether or not a dog is allowed in often ends in just letting them die great of being wrong and getting sides sued for discrimination. The only thing the law covers for a properly prescribed ESA is housing accommodation (which frankly even though it exists is easy for a lessor to deny an applicant for another insane reason to beat a discrimination issue) and travel.", "\n\nNo, you are NTA. It's important to be respectful when talking to your friend about her dog, but not to the point where it endangers the safety of anyone who might be present at the event. You were just making sure that your friend understands the difference between emotional support animals and service animals, which is entirely reasonable. There may have been a misunderstanding, but it's better to voice your concerns respectfully than to stay silent and possibly allow your friend to put herself, the other guests, or her beloved pup in an unsafe situation.", "NTA\n\nAn emotional support animal does not require training.\n\nA service dog does require training. \n\nWile both are important they are not the same", "Assuming you're in the USA, emotional support animals are not covered under ADA. They cannot be service animals. Technically this is correct and this, NTA", "100% this", "you are right.", "[removed]", "*how dare you be right and me wrong*", "No, they just shared the facts. There was no opinion involved. The law distinguishes between service animals, which you're allowed to bring to most public places, and emotional support animals, which you're not. The difference is indeed whether the animal has been trained to perform at least one specific task to help you function.", "This is the 2nd instance of you copying someone else comment on this thread."]}
