Originally his plan was to stay with us for a night and then stay with his friend for most of the break except for Christmas Eve and Christmas. Joseph was helping his dad replace a second-story window on our house the other day and fell, got a concussion and broke his elbow. He had a quick surgery to put in some pins or whatever. My mom asked me to clear out my second room (his old room) since he would be staying a little longer than planned. I cleared off the bed and then went to visit with my friend. When our parents got back with Joseph they got mad that the room wasn't in good enough conditions for his high standards I guess. I came back and cleaned up more of the room.\n\nYesterday he just laid around in the room all day and to my knowledge didn't need much. My step-dad had to work and my mom had to leave for a couple of hours to pick up my grandparents from the airport and take them home. They told me to \"watch after Joseph\" as if he's a child. When they left, I peeked into his room and he was asleep.\n\nI went to go see my friend again I left his meds, a cup of water, and a note saying where I was and to call me if he needed anything otherwise I'd be back a little later. I meant to only be gone for an hour or so but you know what happens when friends get to talking and catching up. Plus this was going to be the last time I'd get to see her because she's going out of town with her family for two weeks then back to school and our first visit already got interrupted.\n\nWell, to my surprise, my mom brought my grandparents back to the house so they could eat a quick dinner before driving them the rest of the way to their house. She called me upset and told me to get home. Later when she got back again and Joseph's dad got home they lectured me about trust and irresponsibility going so far as to say I was a selfish brat for leaving when they told me not to. My argument back was that Joseph slept through everything and was fine. Besides that, while yes I get he's hurt, he's a grown ass adult and can take care of himself and he could have called me if he needed something. I wasn't far away. And they didn't even tell me not to leave, they just said to watch after him. That doesn't require me to hover by his bedside for hours.\n\nA day later and my mom has come around but my step-dad is still angry. He made the decision to take a sick day today so he could stay home but now he's blaming me for that even though it was his choice. I told him he didn't have to because I didn't have any plans but all he says is \"that's not the point.\"\n\nAITA or who is the AH?\n\nEDIT: They were told to let him sleep and wake him every few hours for meds. I was not told to wake him up.", "created_utc": 1702504458, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18hsa6r/aita_for_leaving_my_wholeass_adult_stepbrother/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He literally fell out a window, broke his elbow and has a concussion and you're very like..... whatever. Just because a person is an adult doesn't mean they don't need a little bit of help after an event like that. Your friend couldn't have come over to hang out at your place? I hope you're never in a situation like this where you're hurt and recovering, but because you're \"an adult\" you need NO help ever. YTA, with a dash of esh because your parent's shouldn't have left with him someone who clearly had so little fucks to give.", "YTA - you should look up what a concussion does to someone.\n\nYou were being very selfish.  He's on meds, has a concussion and a broken arm.  You were only thinking about you.  Also, don't expect too much if you ever need any help because according to your logic, you're a.... checks notes ..... \"grown ass adult\".  If you ask then you are creating a double standard by your own hand.  I'm willing to bet that they're going to throw it in your face and you can do nothing about it because here you are championing it.", "I dunno, you seem pretty cold to me. Maybe the injury doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but I imagine there could always be post complications of some sort. \n\nAs someone who has had my right hand disabled for almost 6 months I can assure you that while maybe it doesn't seem like a big deal, it effects every single aspect of your life and can make it significantly more difficult.\n\nI think you sound old enough to have a little bit more empathy than you're showing.\n\nYTA", "It's better to rest after a concussion as sleep is an important part of healing and that's coming from an ER doc. \n\nWhat you need to be concerned about is headaches, visual disturbances, nausea and vomiting, unequal pupils. \n\nI have no opinion either if Y T A or N T A. I know medically sleep is good and very much needed but I would still monitor my family member's breathing (probably) every 15-30 mins if i was taking care of them and I would have my friend come visit me, instead of leaving.", "A concussion that major could have complications where he wouldn't BE ABLE to call. So yea you're kinda the asshole here. \n\nYou should have had your friend come over to the house if you wanted to see them that bad.", "YTA.  Concussions can be very serious.  Stop being a d1ck.", "YTA. \n\nYou sound like you don't have a good relationship with this person and are doing absolute bare minimum. He just had surgery to install hardware for a broken elbow - which means he's got a sling, cast of some kind, and limited use of that limb. He's high on pain meds and handicapped right now, and you refuse to even ask your friend to come to you? It's not like they were asking you to help him shower, they just wanted a room cleared out and a babysitter for a while in case he fell or something while moving around.", "TLDR \"AITA for leaving a guy with a broken elbow so I can go hang out with my friends\"\n\nYes, yes you are", "YTA He had a concussion and just had surgery, so he could have had all kinds of problems: blood clot, infection, etc. they were counting on you to watch him. A person who has a concussion and just had surgery should not be left alone. You sound like an eight-year-old.", "YTA, why because your step brother has a concussion", "YTA- watch after means that you\u2019re in the same home as the person you\u2019re watching. Honestly, you are a selfish little brat and it sounds like you\u2019re upset  that your step brother\u2019s injury has inconvenienced you.", "Yta.  He was hurt and not that mobile.  You left him alone when he could have really used help.", "Sorry OP, but soft YTA\n\nA concussion is nothing to mess with, your head is srsly messed up. Falling asleep with a bad concussion could be your last nap ever. \n\nMy last one was bad, couldn't stay awake but between my dog  and family I was woken up every hour (Doc recommendation). I'm still here. The bad one before that I can't even remember. (but I was taken to a hospital eventually so yeah for public health care)\n\nBroken bones? Painful and horribly frustrating not being able to do what you could do before getting hurt. I've broken arm, wrist, foot... Non was fun and when I had assistance it was super appreciated.\n\nHowever, it sounds like you're not really familiar with concessions and broken bones so I get not understanding the importance of having someone there.\n\nI'd suggest doing some research, it may help in having a bit more sympathy. Otherwise, just apologize and in the future just think before you act. (Yes I know that is ironic coming from someone with multiple bad concussions/ broken bones but there it is.)", "YTA.  You left a concussed, not long out of surgery person alone?  Meds?  And what meds are those?  If you couldn't/wouldn't do it, you should have let a responsible adult know that ahead of time.", "Sorry bud, but because of the injuries, yta. A concussion and a surgery. He's probably on pain medication that can effect people differently. You coulda had your friend just come over to you.", "YTA. He had a head injury and wasn\u2019t meant to be alone. There are actual medical reasons why hospitals cannot discharge patients to be alone under certain medical conditions. I sure hope that someone in your life bothers to care if you ever need help. I wouldn\u2019t count on stepbrother to be that person though. Perhaps those friends you abandoned him to hang out with would be willing to look after you if you had a medical need. If they are anything like you though, I\u2019d expect to be pretty alone if the need arises.", "Nta. If it was bad enough a parent should have stayed home not the step sister", "YTA. He's not sleeping OP, he's drugged to the eyeballs with morphine for the pain of serious surgery. That means he can't do anything much for himself, not go to the toilet, not get his food, not get out of the house if there's a fire. Perhaps someone should have explained this, but heck, you're not a child, you could work it out. Personally, I'm out of it for 48 hours after a general anaesthetic, just completely done. Other people have it worse.", "NTA.\n\nIf your mom or step-dad were so worried about your step-brother one of them should have stayed home with him. Your step-dad could have called off work and stayed home with his son. Or your mother could have asked you to pick up your grandparents to stay home if she was so worried. You are trying to see friends during the holidays like everyone else. You are a parent or responsible for your step-brother.", "So Joseph got concussed and you left him with a note to fend for himself cos he's a \"grownass adult\"?? Boy you are a piece of work huh!!!!!\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nLet me put it this way. Because you consented to watch someone at risk of dying unsupervised and then neglected to do so, you could have been criminally liable if he had died on your watch.\n\nAnd yeah, I agree with the ESH people saying your parents should not have trusted you and maybe emphasized why this was important. Even if you aren't very empathetic, it also seems like you are just extremely ignorant of the medicine behind his situation and I would never trust someone to take over care without properly educating them.", "YTA\n\nhe was seriously injured, no matter how much you minimized it. He's on meds and sleeping a lot -- prob means he's in pain.  you snuck out and hoped to return before you were caught. \n\nIf you had plans, then you should have said you couldn't stay home. \n\nMaybe you hate your family though, that would explain why you don't really care much for him or for how everyone is upset. Is that it? Do you already resent him so it doesn't really matter to you that he's hurt? \n\nDude took a sick day to recover, and you make it sound like he's home, so he must be goofing off and feeling better. Your logic is really weak here. Do you think sick and injured people go to work, and well people stay at home to goof around ?", "NTA he broke his elbow not his leg.", "NTA if it was that bad his parent should have been there. He\u2019s not your problem and he\u2019s an adult. They didn\u2019t even bother asking if you would watch him and kept criticizing everything you did", "Nta what did they expect? For you to wipe his ass for him?", "YTA.  He had a concussion.  Which typically comes with a massive headache.  Not to mention surgery on his arm and was likely on pain meds.  Meaning he was going to be unsteady on his feet if he needed to go pee.  That means you left an incapacitated person on meds to potentially fall if he needed to get up alone\u2026with no one to hear if something went wrong.  He can\u2019t call if he\u2019s unconscious.  So yeah, I get why they\u2019re calling you untrustworthy and irresponsible.", "YTA\n\nYou are also a \"whole ass adult\", one who is seriously lacking in the empathy department", "NTA. You are 21. You are a grown ass adult. You can do as you wish.", "INFO: Were you made aware that a concussion is a serious issue and your step-bro needed to be monitored on a regular basis (checked on at least every 1/2 hour - in case issues arise from the concussion)? \n\nINFO: Were you aware that someone with a broken arm would need assistance in the washroom? \n\nINFO: Is it your step-bro dominant hand that is injured? (If so he probably can do next to nothing for himself one handed) \n\nINFO: Seeing as you were as you were told to watch him - did you consider having your friend come to your house instead of going out? - for not considering this as an idea I would say YTA.", "Hi OP,\n\nNTA \n\nUnless your step brother's injury kept him from being able to do necessary tasks independently like opening his medication bottle.\n\nIf your friend was able to visit at your house it might have been a better move to have her come over but I still think what you did was totally fine\n\nStep dad is overreacting and treating the situation inappropriately", "NTA. If you were a guy, I bet they wouldn't make you 'babysit'.", "YTA - a few PINS? That is pretty serious surgery. He also has a concussion and he's on medication. He DOES need looked after and you're irresponsible for leaving him. Should you be solely left with it either? Idk clearly not. But YTA.", "Yta your step bro fell out the window broke his elbow so he can\u2019t move that arm they had to put some sort of stuff in the arm to fix the elbow by surgery making recovery longer. Also that means he is on morphine or something like that he also has a bad concussion. Those kill people that\u2019s why they check to see how bad they are and go from there. Him sleeping with you gone is no defense because just as easily he could have died. They just wanted you to check on him and continue doing so maybe even wake him up help him out like family should. Your friend could have come to your place if not then you could have said sorry I have a family emergency that\u2019s the right thing to do. Your dad has a reason to be butt hurt. Just apologize to everyone like a real apology and then move forward because that\u2019s what needs to happen here. Your dad shouldn\u2019t not talk to you but educate you on how dangerous and reckless you acted.", "YTA. What the fuck is wrong with you? Hope that you won't get seriously injured and needed help one day, because karma us a bitch.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I hope he never helps you guys again.", "Nta but your parents should have better explained the situation.", "YTA - for all of the reasons already stated, but also, your parents were obviously uncomfortable with him being alone (and rightly so), and they left with the understanding that he wouldn't be alone.

If he's well enough to be home then I would think he's well enough to not need constant monitoring... otherwise he'd still be at the hospital.", "This is my opinion, too. It sounds like maybe OP's mom and stepdad could have been clearer on why they wanted her to stay with Joseph and what to watch out for and be concerned about. At 21, I think I would have listened to my parents and been more concerned, but I don't know that I would have realized how serious a concussion can be or why someone might not be able to call me or 911 if there was an emergency and I wasn't in the house. I don't think OP understood that he might have that kind of emergency, or anything beyond \"his arm is incapacitated and he's sleeping off pain meds so he might need help getting water or snacks if he wakes up.\" It seems like a misunderstanding about what the concern was.", "Specifically, _his_ old room that she's taken over as her \"second room\".

Nope, YTA period", "Sure, why ask the 21 year-old \"adult\" for help with family when mom or dad who actually work and pay the bills can take the day off, because in most jobs people can totally just take the day off wothout notice, so poor OP can gossip with her buddy that she's devastatingly not going to see again for a whole two years... oh, sorry, two whole weeks?\n\nThis was a special case, and she was available. She wasn't exploited. Just selfish.", "Nothing that I'm aware of because all he's done is sleep through it.", "Your parents told you to stay with your brother. You agreed by failing to state you had other plans and then left him. Even if you don\u2019t care about him they do.", "it humors me to no end when someone comes on here asking for judgement but cannot accept judgement not ruling in their favor. my advice would be keep that same energy because you are going to look really hypocritical if you ever need help and backtrack on this\u2026 or you could apologize for not caring enough now and try to mend these relationships while you still are a learning young adult.", "Not really. Hospitals need beds because people are arriving ill, hurt and injured on a constant basis. The beds tend to be reserved for people in need of specialised nursing care - IV fluids, IV meds etc. They aren't for people who need help that any competent and caring person can manage. \n\nThe reason they wanted you to check him every few hours is head injuries are unpredictable. You check them to see if they wake up or are very groggy from waking up - if they don't wake or are groggy, then they may need a scan to check there isn't a bleed. Scans aren't done routinely as have own risks. Concussions can also lead to confusion and issues with balance so things like falls are more likely. You can't always prevent them but you were meant to be a safety net in case he worsened and suddenly was at death's door. \n\nDon't promise what you can't or won't deliver. You are lucky your brother had no complications from a severe fall and I hope you have people that actually care about you if you ever break a leg, suffer a concussion or anything else that needs help while healing. Have you had much experience personally with broken bones or concussion?", "You are young and naive and are showing it.  You are being held accountable for your actions just like any grown ass adult would.", "Hahaha YTA\n\nI'm guessing you've never had a concussion or surgery before.", "That's something a child would say.  Sounds like you've never been in a real accident before, nor had to worry about medical bills.

Or he could if you didn't *lie* about watching him.\n\nDude, even just saying \"I can't\" to your parents would be better than this.", "Until you can't.", "That\u2019s not how it works.", "Uh no. The point of releasing someone for home care is so they can rest without all the noise of a hospital. Concussions are no joke. I got one skiing. Your brother might have been sleeping but with a head injury, broken bones and looped up on morphine, he very well could have needed help. It's not a \"whatever\" as you say. Yta.", ">I have to be on my deathbed before I need help because I can take care of myself.\n\nAnd yet you live at home. If you're so independent, move out.", "The whole point is people with concussions need to be monitored i.e. no left alone because really really bad shit can happen", "He could spike a fever from the surgery and be delirious and not able to do anything and need someone to take care of him and call 911. He could have a pulmonary embolism from the surgery and need you to call 911. He could have a subdural hematoma and have a seizure or become unconscious and need you to call 911.", "You can't dial 911 if he has a seizure?", "That's what a concussion is...and likely there are things he has to do or not do to treat his concussion.  Like excessive sleeping is likely bad.  Anyways...if you didn't agree you needed to stay with him, then you should have had that discussion with your parents then, not agree then bag off. \n\nToo bad you dislike your brother so much.  Sounds like you're doing the bare minimum, if that.", "People with the concussion aren\u2019t supposed to sleep through it. There were probably discharge orders that gave instructions for watching him and waking them up periodically. This is serious stuff and you\u2019re acting so nonchalant like it\u2019s nothing.", "I think you could've called/texted him to check in if you didn't hear from him, especially bc you were out longer than you intended to be. Again I think this is a situation everyone needs to get passed and hope never repeats but if it does you'll know what you could do differently", "They both said he's supposed to sleep through it, I think one of his meds is a sleep aid even. Information on here does not match what all they were told."]}
