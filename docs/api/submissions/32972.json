Originally his plan was to stay with us for a night and then stay with his friend for most of the break except for Christmas Eve and Christmas. Joseph was helping his dad replace a second-story window on our house the other day and fell, got a concussion and broke his elbow. He had a quick surgery to put in some pins or whatever. My mom asked me to clear out my second room (his old room) since he would be staying a little longer than planned. I cleared off the bed and then went to visit with my friend. When our parents got back with Joseph they got mad that the room wasn't in good enough conditions for his high standards I guess. I came back and cleaned up more of the room.\n\nYesterday he just laid around in the room all day and to my knowledge didn't need much. My step-dad had to work and my mom had to leave for a couple of hours to pick up my grandparents from the airport and take them home. They told me to \"watch after Joseph\" as if he's a child. When they left, I peeked into his room and he was asleep.\n\nI went to go see my friend again I left his meds, a cup of water, and a note saying where I was and to call me if he needed anything otherwise I'd be back a little later. I meant to only be gone for an hour or so but you know what happens when friends get to talking and catching up. Plus this was going to be the last time I'd get to see her because she's going out of town with her family for two weeks then back to school and our first visit already got interrupted.\n\nWell, to my surprise, my mom brought my grandparents back to the house so they could eat a quick dinner before driving them the rest of the way to their house. She called me upset and told me to get home. Later when she got back again and Joseph's dad got home they lectured me about trust and irresponsibility going so far as to say I was a selfish brat for leaving when they told me not to. My argument back was that Joseph slept through everything and was fine. Besides that, while yes I get he's hurt, he's a grown ass adult and can take care of himself and he could have called me if he needed something. I wasn't far away. And they didn't even tell me not to leave, they just said to watch after him. That doesn't require me to hover by his bedside for hours.\n\nA day later and my mom has come around but my step-dad is still angry. He made the decision to take a sick day today so he could stay home but now he's blaming me for that even though it was his choice. I told him he didn't have to because I didn't have any plans but all he says is \"that's not the point.\"\n\nAITA or who is the AH?\n\nEDIT: They were told to let him sleep and wake him every few hours for meds.

He literally fell out a window, broke his elbow and has a concussion and you're very like..... whatever.

I hope you're never in a situation like this where you're hurt and recovering, but because you're \"an adult\" you need NO help ever. YTA, with a dash of esh because your parent's shouldn't have left with him someone who clearly had so little fucks to give.", "YTA - you should look up what a concussion does to someone.\n\nYou were being very selfish.  He's on meds, has a concussion and a broken arm.  You were only thinking about you.  Also, don't expect too much if you ever need any help because according to your logic, you're a.... checks notes ..... \"grown ass adult\".  If you ask then you are creating a double standard by your own hand.  I'm willing to bet that they're going to throw it in your face and you can do nothing about it because here you are championing it.", "[removed]", "It's better to rest after a concussion as sleep is an important part of healing and that's coming from an ER doc. \n\nWhat you need to be concerned about is headaches, visual disturbances, nausea and vomiting, unequal pupils. \n\nI have no opinion either if Y T A or N T A. I know medically sleep is good and very much needed but I would still monitor my family member's breathing (probably) every 15-30 mins if i was taking care of them and I would have my friend come visit me, instead of leaving.", "A concussion that major could have complications where he wouldn't BE ABLE to call. So yea you're kinda the asshole here. \n\nYou should have had your friend come over to the house if you wanted to see them that bad.", "YTA.  Concussions can be very serious.  Stop being a d1ck.", "YTA. \n\nYou sound like you don't have a good relationship with this person and are doing absolute bare minimum. He just had surgery to install hardware for a broken elbow - which means he's got a sling, cast of some kind, and limited use of that limb. He's high on pain meds and handicapped right now, and you refuse to even ask your friend to come to you? It's not like they were asking you to help him shower, they just wanted a room cleared out and a babysitter for a while in case he fell or something while moving around.", "TLDR \"AITA for leaving a guy with a broken elbow so I can go hang out with my friends\"\n\nYes, yes you are", "YTA He had a concussion and just had surgery, so he could have had all kinds of problems: blood clot, infection, etc. they were counting on you to watch him. A person who has a concussion and just had surgery should not be left alone. You sound like an eight-year-old.", "YTA, why because your step brother has a concussion", "YTA- watch after means that you\u2019re in the same home as the person you\u2019re watching. Honestly, you are a selfish little brat and it sounds like you\u2019re upset  that your step brother\u2019s injury has inconvenienced you.", "Yta.  He was hurt and not that mobile.  You left him alone when he could have really used help.", "Sorry OP, but soft YTA\n\nA concussion is nothing to mess with, your head is srsly messed up. Falling asleep with a bad concussion could be your last nap ever. \n\nMy last one was bad, couldn't stay awake but between my dog  and family I was woken up every hour (Doc recommendation). I'm still here. The bad one before that I can't even remember. (but I was taken to a hospital eventually so yeah for public health care)\n\nBroken bones? Painful and horribly frustrating not being able to do what you could do before getting hurt. I've broken arm, wrist, foot... Non was fun and when I had assistance it was super appreciated.\n\nHowever, it sounds like you're not really familiar with concessions and broken bones so I get not understanding the importance of having someone there.\n\nI'd suggest doing some research, it may help in having a bit more sympathy. Otherwise, just apologize and in the future just think before you act. (Yes I know that is ironic coming from someone with multiple bad concussions/ broken bones but there it is.)", "YTA.  You left a concussed, not long out of surgery person alone?  Meds?  And what meds are those?  If you couldn't/wouldn't do it, you should have let a responsible adult know that ahead of time.", "Sorry bud, but because of the injuries, yta. A concussion and a surgery. He's probably on pain medication that can effect people differently. You coulda had your friend just come over to you.", "YTA. He had a head injury and wasn\u2019t meant to be alone. There are actual medical reasons why hospitals cannot discharge patients to be alone under certain medical conditions. I sure hope that someone in your life bothers to care if you ever need help. I wouldn\u2019t count on stepbrother to be that person though. Perhaps those friends you abandoned him to hang out with would be willing to look after you if you had a medical need. If they are anything like you though, I\u2019d expect to be pretty alone if the need arises.", "Nta. If it was bad enough a parent should have stayed home not the step sister", "YTA. He's not sleeping OP, he's drugged to the eyeballs with morphine for the pain of serious surgery. That means he can't do anything much for himself, not go to the toilet, not get his food, not get out of the house if there's a fire. Perhaps someone should have explained this, but heck, you're not a child, you could work it out. Personally, I'm out of it for 48 hours after a general anaesthetic, just completely done. Other people have it worse.", "NTA.\n\nIf your mom or step-dad were so worried about your step-brother one of them should have stayed home with him.

Boy you are a piece of work huh!!!!!\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nLet me put it this way. Because you consented to watch someone at risk of dying unsupervised and then neglected to do so, you could have been criminally liable if he had died on your watch.\n\nAnd yeah, I agree with the ESH people saying your parents should not have trusted you and maybe emphasized why this was important. Even if you aren't very empathetic, it also seems like you are just extremely ignorant of the medicine behind his situation and I would never trust someone to take over care without properly educating them.", "YTA\n\nhe was seriously injured, no matter how much you minimized it. He's on meds and sleeping a lot -- prob means he's in pain.  you snuck out and hoped to return before you were caught. \n\nIf you had plans, then you should have said you couldn't stay home. \n\nMaybe you hate your family though, that would explain why you don't really care much for him or for how everyone is upset. Is that it? Do you already resent him so it doesn't really matter to you that he's hurt? \n\nDude took a sick day to recover, and you make it sound like he's home, so he must be goofing off and feeling better. Your logic is really weak here. Do you think sick and injured people go to work, and well people stay at home to goof around ?", "NTA he broke his elbow not his leg.", "NTA if it was that bad his parent should have been there. He\u2019s not your problem and he\u2019s an adult. They didn\u2019t even bother asking if you would watch him and kept criticizing everything you did", "Nta what did they expect? For you to wipe his ass for him?", "YTA.  He had a concussion.  Which typically comes with a massive headache.  Not to mention surgery on his arm and was likely on pain meds.  Meaning he was going to be unsteady on his feet if he needed to go pee.  That means you left an incapacitated person on meds to potentially fall if he needed to get up alone\u2026with no one to hear if something went wrong.  He can\u2019t call if he\u2019s unconscious.  So yeah, I get why they\u2019re calling you untrustworthy and irresponsible.", "YTA\n\nYou are also a \"whole ass adult\", one who is seriously lacking in the empathy department", "NTA. You are 21. You are a grown ass adult. You can do as you wish.", "INFO: Were you made aware that a concussion is a serious issue and your step-bro needed to be monitored on a regular basis (checked on at least every 1/2 hour - in case issues arise from the concussion)? \n\nINFO: Were you aware that someone with a broken arm would need assistance in the washroom? \n\nINFO: Is it your step-bro dominant hand that is injured? (If so he probably can do next to nothing for himself one handed) \n\nINFO: Seeing as you were as you were told to watch him - did you consider having your friend come to your house instead of going out? - for not considering this as an idea I would say YTA.", "Hi OP,\n\nNTA \n\nUnless your step brother's injury kept him from being able to do necessary tasks independently like opening his medication bottle.\n\nIf your friend was able to visit at your house it might have been a better move to have her come over but I still think what you did was totally fine\n\nStep dad is overreacting and treating the situation inappropriately", "NTA. If you were a guy, I bet they wouldn't make you 'babysit'.", "YTA - a few PINS? That is pretty serious surgery. He also has a concussion and he's on medication. He DOES need looked after and you're irresponsible for leaving him. Should you be solely left with it either? Idk clearly not. But YTA.", "Yta your step bro fell out the window broke his elbow so he can\u2019t move that arm they had to put some sort of stuff in the arm to fix the elbow by surgery making recovery longer. Also that means he is on morphine or something like that he also has a bad concussion. Those kill people that\u2019s why they check to see how bad they are and go from there. Him sleeping with you gone is no defense because just as easily he could have died. They just wanted you to check on him and continue doing so maybe even wake him up help him out like family should. Your friend could have come to your place if not then you could have said sorry I have a family emergency that\u2019s the right thing to do. Your dad has a reason to be butt hurt. Just apologize to everyone like a real apology and then move forward because that\u2019s what needs to happen here. Your dad shouldn\u2019t not talk to you but educate you on how dangerous and reckless you acted.", "YTA. What the fuck is wrong with you?

It sounds like maybe OP's mom and stepdad could have been clearer on why they wanted her to stay with Joseph and what to watch out for and be concerned about. At 21, I think I would have listened to my parents and been more concerned, but I don't know that I would have realized how serious a concussion can be or why someone might not be able to call me or 911 if there was an emergency and I wasn't in the house. I don't think OP understood that he might have that kind of emergency, or anything beyond \"his arm is incapacitated and he's sleeping off pain meds so he might need help getting water or snacks if he wakes up.\" It seems like a misunderstanding about what the concern was.", "Specifically, _his_ old room that she's taken over as her \"second room\".

Hospitals need beds because people are arriving ill, hurt and injured on a constant basis. The beds tend to be reserved for people in need of specialised nursing care - IV fluids, IV meds etc. They aren't for people who need help that any competent and caring person can manage. \n\nThe reason they wanted you to check him every few hours is head injuries are unpredictable. You check them to see if they wake up or are very groggy from waking up - if they don't wake or are groggy, then they may need a scan to check there isn't a bleed. Scans aren't done routinely as have own risks. Concussions can also lead to confusion and issues with balance so things like falls are more likely. You can't always prevent them but you were meant to be a safety net in case he worsened and suddenly was at death's door. \n\nDon't promise what you can't or won't deliver. You are lucky your brother had no complications from a severe fall and I hope you have people that actually care about you if you ever break a leg, suffer a concussion or anything else that needs help while healing.

The point of releasing someone for home care is so they can rest without all the noise of a hospital. Concussions are no joke. I got one skiing.

Yta.", ">I have to be on my deathbed before I need help because I can take care of myself.\n\nAnd yet you live at home.

Even getting up is challenging for someone with a concussion. YTA.", "YTA, OP. you are absolutely the asshole.", "Nope, nope, nope. YTA. Completely. As a proud owner of five concussions, they are not petty little nothings. My brother had a seizure with a concussion. FYI, people can\u2019t text during a seizure. You have said in your response to comments, that as an adult, you can take care of yourself. But what you actually come off as is a petulant child.", "YTA. You might not like your stepbrother much, but you were asked to help. He was going to be sleeping in his old room. All you did was clean off the bed.

It's a real danger, if it was a serious concussion, which falling from a 2nd story resulting in surgery to install pins kinda indicates. \n\nHe didn't need watching like he was a kid.

Downplaying his injuries - A concussion is brain damage, if left unattended can cause serious longterm damage and injury. The broken arm needed pins in it, so he had surgery for that, that's not a minor thing either. It's cruel of you to act like he has a common cold.\n2. The drama you create over having to clean up your SECOND room - There are tons of people that don't even have their own bedroom growing up, that have to share with siblings, yet you act entitled to two whole rooms and can't even be bothered to properly cleam one so your injured step(?)brother can TEMPORARILY use it to recover.\n3. For the first irresponsible behavior - You were asked to do one simple thing to help lighten the load for your parents and stepbrother, yet you decided to do the bare minimum and ditch them so you could hang out with a friend. Astonishing. And you managed to embarass yourself by getting an angry call and having to do it properly anyway, had you done it right the first time, you could have hung out with friends longer, not been scolded, and saved yourself some embarassment.\n4. The second irresponsible behavior - You left an injured person to fend for themselves, when it's been established he can't. You managed to lose your parents trust by ditching your injured stepbrother to hang out with friends AGAIN. Incredible. You are putting a lot in \"well technically they didn't say don't leave the house\" but yes, that is what they said, that's what it means when someone tells you to watch over someone injured. It means be physically present in case they need help, they can't go waiting for your ass to take forever if they fall out of bed on top of their broken arm, or if they're having a seizure from their concussion. \n5. Saying your stepdad CHOSE to take the day off - No, he did not CHOOSE to, he HAD to, because you can not be trusted. You have proven yourself unreliable and irresponsible, and on top of that untrustworthy. They trusted you to watch over your stepbrother, you did not. They trusted you to clean out a room so he could have a place to recover, you did not. Your stepdad now has to take time off work (that he obviously can't miss) because you can't be bothered to do the bare minimum for another human being.\n6. For your attitude in general - It's really sad and I hope you're 16 year old or younger, because if you're older your behavior is incredibly sad.

Someone may seem fine at first, but they can quickly take a turn for the worst. AND he\u2019s on pain meds. What if something happened to him in his sleep?? THAT\u2019s why everyone was so upset with you leaving him alone for a day. \n\nI knew as soon as you said \u201c\u2026or whatever\u201d about his condition that you were gonna be the asshole. You don\u2019t give a fuck about him, you probably don\u2019t even like him, and it\u2019s very obvious. \n\nBut sorry a family emergency meant your little hang out was cut short and you had to clean your \u201csecond room\u201d \ud83d\ude44\n\nYTA.", "OP your low levels of empathy should be alarming to you. If you had just had surgery, had a concussion, were on strong meds in a house that wasn\u2019t your own wouldn\u2019t you want someone else to be home with you just in case you needed something or had a medical emergency? It is blatantly obvious you did what you wanted instead of what you should have done. I think you know that deep down. It\u2019s hard to admit we\u2019ve done something wrong or acted selfishly, but it\u2019s a bit part of growing up. If you think your behavior is normal and that is how you would expect others to treat you, you need to seek counseling. It isn\u2019t normal, if that is how you\u2019ve been treated growing up it is not healthy and has skewed your worldview.", "Dear OP. After a major concussion, which is what sounds like your family member experienced, I took a full bottle of pills that should have killed me.\n\nBrain injuries are not something to take lightly. The suicide risk after a tbi are astronomical. I understand not wanting to take care of someone. So you should have made it **extremely clear** you weren\u2019t willing to take care of him.

They specifically told me they don\u2019t recommend that anymore. They focused on rest and staying off screens. You still watch to make sure they don\u2019t start vomiting or something but you don\u2019t wake them up every hour. It can also cause irritability, which can be confused with worsening symptoms of the concussion.", "Then her parents should have been more clear with her about what her SB actually needed. They told her not to wake him up.", "Yeah and it's not like the OP didn't care. She still checked on him, gave him his medication and some water. She did what was asked of her. It's not her fault her parents expected her to read their minds to gleem the rest of the relevant information that they didn't feel like sharing.", "I missed the concussion part. But I'm not sure why the parents are unable to care for their son though. This seems like a lot to dump on a step sibling, yeah?", "She had no reason to think he might have a seizure and even if he had had a seizure unless she'd been sitting by him bedside staring at him sleep she probably wouldn't have known. \nPlus if his doctors had believed that was a risk, he wouldn't have been at home. \nNot to mention, of the parents had thought that was a risk they should have stayed with him.", "That's a lot more hostility than what's called for. It's not surprising you're easily reactive judging by your user name. \n\nI'm not sure why everyone thinks she was selfish and irresponsible. I also didn't say I would do what OP did. If you read my comments to her you'd see I made a few suggestions of what I would have done differently. \n\nFrom what I understand he was discharged from the hospital and the hospital did not give specific instructions on care. I also said everyone was OVERreacting meaning reacting too strongly. That doesn't mean no reaction was warranted. I also said this should be something the family could get through and resolve. The mom even is changing her feelings on the matter. A calm conversation about how OP should act instead is fine and be done with the matter.\n\nOP was not far and reachable by phone. She left a note and everything saying he should call her if he needs her and she will return without complaint. She's also in her early twenties and may not have ever had to care for someone before. Early twenties is still really young and some ppl haven't had life experiences that lead to them developing certain skills like being cautious, problem solving, perspective taking. She deserves to learn from her actions but not be totally condemed. Especially bc step brother was fine! Everyone is panicking over a what could have happened scenario. Disaster was averted so now we all get on the same page as a family so we each understand how we should and shouldn't handle things like care. \n\nHe was also sleeping and seemed likely to sleep or take it easy and do nothing besides maybe watch tv.", "Unclear, but my mom has anxiety and depression that have been getting worse lately, so it's probably that. She's been under a lot of stress and doesn't take good care of herself. She seems to be doing better now, but at first we were quite worried and thought she might be having a stroke or getting dementia. My siblings and I are still keeping an eye as best we can, though unfortunately none of us live in the same country as she does and she has no family nearby.", "With two rooms!!  Not leaving anytime soon.", "Literally. I get that a lot of people need to live with their parents for longer nowadays - but also, if you still live with your parents, you don't get to complain that you're \"so independent\" and that you \"never rely on anyone\". Because you literally *are* relying on someone right now.\n\nLike realistically, if OP was kicked out *today*, would they have a place of their own to live in? I'm not talking about crashing on someone's couch - I mean *their own place*. If the answer is no, they are not independent and they cannot claim they are. They are in fact still *fully* dependent on their parents.", "But how can everyone else think they are the AH when clearly aren't the AH? /s", "The waking people up after a concussion thing isn\u2019t actually medically recommended any more.
