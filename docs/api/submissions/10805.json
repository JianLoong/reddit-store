{"id": 10805, "submission_id": "11aufo2", "title": "AITA for asking my neighbor if her daughter is interested in some paid work?", "selftext": "Late last summer, my boyfriend and I (both early 30s) bought the house that we were renting, which happens to be on a cove of a river. I work from home (but long days) boyfriend is gone 12 hours a day. With winter coming to an end, I decided to start prepping the house/yard/dock for the summer so we have everything ready when boating season comes and we can cut back on work and have some fun. Some things - like getting the lawn ready and spring cleaning the boat dock - were things the previous owners would do in the spring, so this is our first year doing it ourselves. I also wanted to turn our enclosed patio into a workspace so I can enjoy the view and weather while I work. With all this work, there's a lot of tasks that would be nice to have help with, and I figured I could pay for some help to save some time. \n\nWe've lived here for 2 years, and 6 months after we moved in, somebody rented out the house a couple doors down. It's a couple (early 50s), Jim and Pam, and their daughter (12yo). We've always had a good relationship with them. We've taken them out on the boat a handful of times, even gone out to dinner and to their daughters soccer games. At this point, we've come to genuinely think of them as friends more than neighbors.\n\nThere was an awkwardness surrounding the house purchase. When the owners put our house up for sale, we were given first right of refusal (as a courtesy because we already lived here). They got a lot of offers and we matched the highest, meaning it legally had to be sold to us. It turns out the neighbors have been trying to buy a house on this cove for 20 years (these don't go up for sale often) and they were incredibly bummed to miss out. We didn't know that theirs was the highest offer until Pam told us later, but tbh we would have matched regardless. We adore this house and the life we have here. They were upset at the situation but seemed to move on. It was unfortunate but we made the best decision for us. Plus, they have first right of refusal on an elderly neighbor's house and she plans to move to an elderly community in the next few years.\n\nSo, anyway, the other day I texted Pam and said I had some tasks (specifically, hosing down the enclosed patio, mopping the boat dock, pulling weeds) and that I would pay her daughter generously if she was interested. Pam took 2 days to respond and said that she feels violated because she thought we thought of them as friends, not as inferiors that we pay to do their labor, and that we were jerks to assume that he daughter \"needed\" money. She said that it wasn't appropriate to ask a neighbor and I should have asked someone I'm closer to or a family member. I can't decide if she's right that I should have picked somewhere else or if she's being sensitive. Am I the asshole? \n\nTl; dr: Asked the neighbors, with whom I'm very friendly, if I could pay their daughter to do some age-appropriate tasks. They felt like I degraded them and crossed a boundary. AITA?\n\nQuick edit to add - their daughter mentioned that she's turning 13 in a couple weeks and she was excited to get a babysitting job because she wants to save up for a new VR set. So, me asking if she wanted to do tasks was done with that in mind - maybe random though since it's not babysitting.", "created_utc": 1677253561, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11aufo2/aita_for_asking_my_neighbor_if_her_daughter_is/", "score": 288, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't think your relationship is the same as it was before now since you bought the house.", "NTA - What an absurd reaction to a perfectly normal request. She is being incredibly sensitive to a non-existent issue", "NTA I think that there is way more to this responce than you offering a job to their daughter, some resentment there probably because of the house you bought. You did not do anything wrong in my opinion but obviously they got offended so make a small apology and move on.

Hopefully they learn to see it that way and it doesn't mess up a good relationship", "Totally NTA.  When I was twelve, I loved to have opportunities to earn a little money thrown my way.  It's not a reflection of you thinking you are better than them - that was a very strange response from your neighbor.  By the way, a twelve year old certainly is lower on the social totem pole than adults and they probably shouldn't be teaching her otherwise.  She may wind up pretty entitled.", "NTA, i\u2019ve been asked and paid to do odd jobs for my neighbours, including some yard work, shoveling snow and watching their kids\u2026 and our relationship is nowhere near as close and your relationship with your neighbour\u2026 this is just a bit weird on their part. taking up odd jobs at this age would only benefit the kid as a) it teaches them abt responsibility b) builds good work ethic c) the kid can potentially get a head start on financial competence d) it gives them something to do with their spare time\u2026", "NTA. \n\nThat\u2019s sort of the same thing as neighbor kids mowing lawns or shoveling snow.

I agree with you; hiring the neighbor's child would have been an act of goodwill.", "NTA - And not inappropriate! Neighbors ask neighbors kids about doing lawn work all the time. It's tradition!", "NTA.  Many people hire their friends' children for yard work, babysitting, dog walking, etc.", "Absolutely NTA. Asking a neighborhood teenager if they want some part time work is normal, standard, neighborly stuff. If you'd asked an adult it would have had a weird tone but a 13 year old?? No. If you want to try to talk her off her ledge you could send her an overly kind note saying \"oh no, I didn't mean you or your husband... I was talking to 13 year old and she was excited about picking up some little jobs to earn money for her VR headset. No worries.\" Or you could ask her husband wtf. But odds are if she's this reactive it's hopeless.", "NTA\n\nPam is taking it way to personal that you all purchased the house. Shes choosing to believe that you're \"flaunting\" your \"riches\" in her face. You should probably sit down and have a chat with her if the friendship is that important. Make sure to explain you just though you would help out their daughter b/c she said she was taking babysitting gigs to save money for a VR set.", "NTA\n\nShe just sounds salty. It is a competitive market and you don\u2019t always win.\n\nIt might have been best to ask if the kid is interested in working some chores for money instead of assuming but not enough to make you an AH", "I think NTA and your neighbor is overreacting. It would be sufficient to politely decline the offer if you are not interested.", "NTA, and your neighbors are spoiled entitled people with poor work ethic.

You needed help and asked a friend if their child would like to do it and be compensated for their time and effort.

It says a lot about how they look at people they pay money to for services though, inferior...", "Definitely NTA - asking if kids want to do neighbor chores for extra money is totally normal, especially seeing the text you sent.

But just know, it\u2019s to smooth things over and not because you did anything wrong.", "I think there is more social snobbery than you realize going on here. The problem isn't that they think you are being pretentious or treating them as social inferiors. The problem is that they view THEMSELVES as your social betters, and resent that:\n\nA: You got the house they wanted, when you were merely renters before and had to actually finance your house, when they could pay in cash (seriously, who tells people that unless they want to rub it in?)\n\nB: They have more certs/seniority/money than you, but you still presume to offer their daughter work/money for a job they view as beneath her. \n\nThese people are snobs. They may be friendly snobs, but they are still snobs. NTA.", "NTA I did a lot of work at that age for neighbors.  I liked them but I wouldn't have done it for free.\n\nObviously, Pam has had some trauma surrounding some part of it.  Not your fault.", "INFO: can you post the exact text language you sent?", "NTA. Sounds like they're playing a game of Keep Up with the Jonses and are sore that they didn't get the exact house.", "NTA, depending on how you worded the offer. I can imagine there could be some instances in which it could accidentally sound insulting (if you were overly demanding or made it sound like the tasks were beneath you/your family, for example). But if you worded it like most normal people (e.g. \u201cHey, we were hoping to hire a kid to do a few odd jobs coming up. We would love to have Daughter if she is interested\u201d), I think you are good. I occasionally did odd jobs for neighbors (letting the dog out, watering plants) for neighbors in high school and even summers in college. They were all social \u201cequals\u201d or whatever. I was happy to help and it was sweet of them to pay me, regardless of if I needed the money. \n\nDid Pam chill out when you explained that you meant nothing malicious by your offer?", "NTA. Your neighbor flew off the handle for no good reason.", "NAH. Y'all clearly have two distinct culture views on such an ask. People are different. I would just apologize and try to explain you did not mean it like that but your experience/past such an ask is made of youth to give them a chance to earn money independently; but you appreciated that as a parent they have some say-so in that and thats why you asked them first. \n\nToo often folks with two perfectly different views fill one has to be \"right.\" Naw, both are right its just culture and past experience.", "INFO: Is there an income disparity here?\n\nIf they're not as wealthy as your husband and you, then I could see why they might be offended. I wouldn't have made such an offer unless I knew the daughter was looking for that kind of work.\n\nI'm going to go with NAH, since you weren't being malicious, but I could see why her mother might be upset in some circumstances.", "NAH: she\u2019s not trying to be rude to you, but that might be a sore subject for her and you may want to clarify. I did that kind of work as a teen for my neighbors to earn pocket money and if you did too that may be a good thing to tell them.  Also mention that she\u2019d be doing it along side you so it\u2019s not a subordinate situation.", "NAH - From sounds of it daughter brought up needing money and you decided to ask.  I  would say have a further convo about the house it sounds like they are still  a little sore over past events  and maybe apologise if it came across that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is the parents who may take it completely wrong.", "NTA- that\u2019s usually how it works for teenagers. It\u2019s a real bonus to be offered a well paying job, rather than have to search one out.", "NTA she resents you and now she has a reason to be angry with you.  Ignore them and move on. They\u2019re going to being bad juju to your house and family.", "NTA\n\nDo you have any other neighborhood kids? Ask those kids and see if they want the gig. Neighbors can see the other kids happily doing it. Pretty good price you\u2019re giving too.", "NTA- It's a reasonable question and a simple no would have sufficed.", "when i was 15 my mom got me a job with her friend who just moved back into town and was opening a shop. my first month we were working out of her house organizing everything before moving into the store space. it was my first \"real\" job (i was paid cash under the table). i worked maybe one to two days a week on the weekends, made $20 an hour and felt like i was making a million bucks. still to date i think that was the best job i ever had. my boss was so fun and just the pride i had working when a lot of my friends didnt have jobs was unmatched. my parents could give me money if i was going out with friends to the movies or something, but it felt *great* to be like 'no its okay, i got this\".\n\nyou were just trying to be nice.

I\u2019ve sent my 9yo to help a neighbor carry in groceries before when she was recovering from a fall and couldn\u2019t do it and my husband wasn\u2019t home to go help. She offered to give him $5 for it but I said that wasn\u2019t a job that required payment.

From what I could see, they both were renters (and the neighbors still are), but I could find no mention of their financial situation.\n\nEta: never mind. I found it in the comments. It is really weird that they would offer that information unprompted.", "This. In my culture, anything to do with kids/family would probably be broached more indirectly like, \"do you know of anyone/any kids who would like a chance to make some money for xyz work?\" If the person on the other end is fine with it, they'd suggest I talk to their kid or promise to let me know once they've discussed it with their kid/partner. Either way, I would let the suggestion come from the parent.", ">Some people are looking for reasons to be offended, try to ignore them.\n\nThis is it exactly. Had OP not offered and hired some other random teenager, they'd have been just as \"insulted\" by the offer because it isn't about OP but their own bitterness and resentment. If they convince themselves that OP is an asshole, they can stew in anger and resentment without having to examine how justified it actually is. They *want* to be angry and miserable and are determined to be so regardless of what OP does or doesn't do.", "I don't think that's it, considering the neighbor husband makes much more than OP and they had enough cash on hand to pay for the house outright."]}
