We'll call my husband \"John\" and we'll call my daughter \"Jen.\" \n\nWhen John and I first started dating. I learned that he grew up in a very religious Pentecostal family. He's not fanatically religious and he always shared stories about strange things he has seen at tent revivals and people claiming they are \"healing\" others from demons, speaking in tongues, etc. John has said he's not nearly religious like his family which I found reassuring because I grew up in a pretty relaxed family when it came to religion. He even told me how refreshing I was to him because of how secular and open-minded I am.\n\nAnytime I've spent time with his family, he always told me not to take anything they said seriously. They really wanted me to convert and join their Pentecostal church, which I didn't want to and it was a point of contention. When we got married, it was an overly religious event but it was to appease his family so they didn't make a huge stink. Appeasing his parents was mostly only in small doses here and there though, so I tolerated it because I love him.\n\nJohn's parents became insufferable and tried to control a lot of decisions when Jen was born. They give John a ton of shit about how concerned they are about Jen being raised by me. They wanted to homeschool her when it was that time for her to start going to school. I shut that shit down real fast. I've talked to John many times about how he needs to stand up to his parents and back me up more. John thought of a compromise where we can send Jen to a Pentecostal private school. I was skeptical, but open-minded and I wanted to meet with teachers and faculty at the school and they seemed alright. I had friends that went to religious schools. So to keep peace amongst the family, we enrolled her. I knew I wanted to make sure her home life would be an environment for open-minded thinking. I've expressed this to John. He told me he would be open to enrolling her to another school if it doesn't work out.\n\nShe's been going to this school for 2 years now. Any time I talk to John about my concerns, he deflects. I've had Jen talk to me about the concept of hell and asking me if I think her grandfather (my dad) is there or if he's in purgatory. I recently witnessed her waving her arm slowly in the air, head bowed to the floor, moving to music when watching TV sometimes. I'm terrified of the indoctrination at such a young age. I've had ENOUGH, I took her out of the school without even telling John because he has absolutely no sense of urgency and shuts down the topic immediately. He was furious with me and screamed at me, and was trying to tell me how much of a nightmare public schools can be and that one of the teacher's at the private school is friends with his mother and she's going to be telling her everything, etc. etc. etc. This is such a clusterfuck and I feel sick about subjecting Jen to all of this conflict and tension.", "created_utc": 1680995702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12g1oex/aita_for_taking_my_daughter_out_of_her/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lay out the minimum demands for how your child will be raised, and if he will not meet them immediately, then you need to lawyer up and smarten up.", "NTA for taking her out of the school.\nYTA for enrolling her to begin with.\n\nWhat did you think was going to happen when you enrolled your child in a religious school? Indoctrination is what they are for.", "NTA. \n\nMyself and my sisters grew up going to that type of school as well as church and have since all left any form of religion. We are all in our 30s and are still learning about how that environment negatively affected us. \n\nI finally left the church entirely after experiencing an intense amount of emotional, mental, and spiritual abuse. \n\nThe concepts being taught in that type of environment can be very damaging to someone\u2019s sense of self worth, identity, and place in the world. \n\nYour in-laws are completely overstepping boundaries with your child. The fact that your husband wasn\u2019t enforcing those firmly with you and rather offered a compromise of this religious school is a huge issue. \n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nPentecostals make other fundamentalist christians look positively sane in comparison. Religious trauma is an inevitable outcome for any kid attending that kind of school for too long, and you were right to rescue her from that!", "100% NTA. It sounds like you're saving your child so she can actually get an education. I wouldn't give a flipping flying fuck what the teacher tells his mother. Your child's education is much more important than pleasing his evangelical mother. For all that religious upbringing, your husband turned out to be a liar when he said he was open to enrolling your child in another school if things didn't turn out. You're right, she's not getting a \nproper education there, she's getting indoctrination. Your husband screaming at you is bs. It would be a deal breaker for me. I'd leave with my child until he fully understands that his parents will not run you and your child's life, period, full stop, end of story.", "ESH, you've been a pushover for your husband and his religious nutters of a family, and now they're indoctrinating your daughter. \n\n\n\nGood luck,", "NTA.  I *strongly* recommend you go to youtube and watch some videos by Sarah Rocksdale who lived that experience.  She has a number of videos on the subject.", "Soft ESH(soft towards you because you tried to compromise). You enrolled your child into a religious environment where she will be taught hell/purgatory exist(and that some people deserve to go there) amongst other religious beliefs. What did you expect to happen? She should have been going to a secular school if you didn't want religious indoctrination to happen.\n\nYour husband is a bigger asshole because he was mad about his reputation being effected(what will his parent's think?!) over his daughter being scared of god(that is what happens when kids believe in hell, trust me on that one). You also chose to keep peace with the family over your daughter.\n\nI feel that sitting in her classes or having deep conversations with her teachers would have been better than just sending her.", "ESH sounds like you put up with A LOT before finally putting your foot down and it's hurting your child. Having the wedding was one thing but you let it get this far just to 'keep the peace' what did it get you? Was your daughter's indoctrination worth keeping the peace instead of going LC or NC with his family or forcing your husband to actually talk to you and confronting him about all this stuff?", "NTA. My ex went to one of those crazy fundamentalist schools\u2014 it was horrifying. He had to rip pages out of his science book that mentioned evolution and dinosaurs. Got slapped more than once for disagreeing with wacky religious views. I could go on- but he was your daughters age and didn\u2019t think to tell his parents because it seemed normal. Whatever your daughter is telling you is just the tip of the iceberg because guarantee other shit is going down that your daughter doesn\u2019t even think to tell you about.

You've failed to recognise that you've married a religious zealot and you've let him manipulate you so far. Stop now.\n\nI went to a Pentecostal school. I was lucky, because I went to a public school for the first 6 years of schooling and I worked as a teen, so I had/made friends outside of that school. So I learned about the world from them.\n\nHere is a non-comprehensive list of things I learned at that school: I'm probably going to hell, you aren't having a mental health crisis because it's actually god talking to/through you. Being the child of a single parent makes you less than human. A complete misunderstanding of how the word \"theory\" is used in science and the separate definition it holds (related: the disclaimer in several subjects, but especially science, that the school was *required* to teach these things, but we all know they aren't true *wink wink*). I'm somehow responsible for my male friends and their bad behaviour, but I have no authority over any man. Women should be subservient to their husband and that women are obligated to love men who love them.\n\nHere is a non-comprehensive list of things I *didn't* learn at that school: Any form of birth control. I am smart and worthy of the same accolades as the male students at the school. Respect for my own bodily autonomy. Physics (our teacher was literally crazy, but he had a family so they \"couldn't\" replace him). How to speak to people in a respectful and kind way, even if we don't agree.", "NTA. Sure you made the mistake in enrolling her to begin with but what makes you NTA is you are trying to do what\u2019s right here. Your family sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA. Your husband is still under the influence of his faith more than he believes. You need to do whatever is best for your child, and if hubby doesn't want to engage, you need to get it done.\n\nI believe you and John need to get into counseling. Divisions like this based on unresolved childhood traumas can tear families apart.", "YTA for going along with John and sending your kid to Pentecostal school in the first place.  Neither of you is religious in that way, you simply agreed to do something inconsistent with your values to placate your in-laws, as apparently your husband is unable to stand up to them.\n\nIt's good that you got her out of there.  Now stop doing things you don't believe in to make other people happy.  Let John scream.  Let John's parents scream.  Take your kid on a lovely outing until they calm down.  Then keep doing what's right for your kid.\n\nIf you don't stop being afraid of people making a big stink when they don't get their way, you're going to end up leading the wrong life. And so is your kid.", "NTA.  Keep your daughter far away from this school and this church.", "I grew up Pentecostal. Every girl in the church I grew up in now has severe ptsd. YTA if you don\u2019t protect your daughter.", "NTA for removing her from school because you were concerned about religion. \n\nYTA because you have allowed your husbands weak spine to interfere with your life and that of your child's. He cares more about image and placating his parents than you or your child. \n\nYou need to get on the same page or get out.", "I would say overall NTA. I think possibly you could have mentioned that you were withdrawing her from the school before you actually did it. As far as what his parent think and if they get mad, they can f*** off. If he is concerned about public schools, you can enroll her in a non religious private school.", "You've lost control of the plot. You need to starting thinking like Katie Holmes.", "NTA. You should not be compromising with you in laws on how to raise your child, at all.", "NTA. Please make an appointment for marriage counseling with a qualified, licensed therapist (not a religious one!) ASAP. John needs to accept that the only people that should be making decisions for your child are the two of you. His parents have no authority in your marriage or over the decisions you make for your child.", "In theory you would be an A for making a unilateral move like that, but don't let him use that as an argument aga him. Yta. F*** that nonsense", "NTA, tell him to give public school a chance. You already tried it his way, now it is your turn.", "ESH.

Why is this a problem? Why is it a 'problem' that the school is at fault for?", "ESH.\n\nYou for agreeing to enrol her there in the first place. Him for having no urgency. You for acting unilaterally, he has a right to know where his child is going to school & a family court would not look favourably on you removing her without telling him.", "YTA.
