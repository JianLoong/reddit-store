He's not fanatically religious and he always shared stories about strange things he has seen at tent revivals and people claiming they are \"healing\" others from demons, speaking in tongues, etc. John has said he's not nearly religious like his family which I found reassuring because I grew up in a pretty relaxed family when it came to religion. He even told me how refreshing I was to him because of how secular and open-minded I am.\n\nAnytime I've spent time with his family, he always told me not to take anything they said seriously. They really wanted me to convert and join their Pentecostal church, which I didn't want to and it was a point of contention. When we got married, it was an overly religious event but it was to appease his family so they didn't make a huge stink. Appeasing his parents was mostly only in small doses here and there though, so I tolerated it because I love him.\n\nJohn's parents became insufferable and tried to control a lot of decisions when Jen was born. They give John a ton of shit about how concerned they are about Jen being raised by me. They wanted to homeschool her when it was that time for her to start going to school. I shut that shit down real fast. I've talked to John many times about how he needs to stand up to his parents and back me up more. John thought of a compromise where we can send Jen to a Pentecostal private school. I was skeptical, but open-minded and I wanted to meet with teachers and faculty at the school and they seemed alright. I had friends that went to religious schools. So to keep peace amongst the family, we enrolled her. I knew I wanted to make sure her home life would be an environment for open-minded thinking. I've expressed this to John. He told me he would be open to enrolling her to another school if it doesn't work out.\n\nShe's been going to this school for 2 years now. Any time I talk to John about my concerns, he deflects. I've had Jen talk to me about the concept of hell and asking me if I think her grandfather (my dad) is there or if he's in purgatory. I recently witnessed her waving her arm slowly in the air, head bowed to the floor, moving to music when watching TV sometimes. I'm terrified of the indoctrination at such a young age. I've had ENOUGH, I took her out of the school without even telling John because he has absolutely no sense of urgency and shuts down the topic immediately. He was furious with me and screamed at me, and was trying to tell me how much of a nightmare public schools can be and that one of the teacher's at the private school is friends with his mother and she's going to be telling her everything, etc. etc. etc. This is such a clusterfuck and I feel sick about subjecting Jen to all of this conflict and tension.", "created_utc": 1680995702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12g1oex/aita_for_taking_my_daughter_out_of_her/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Women should be subservient to their husband and that women are obligated to love men who love them.\n\nHere is a non-comprehensive list of things I *didn't* learn at that school: Any form of birth control. I am smart and worthy of the same accolades as the male students at the school. Respect for my own bodily autonomy.

The only focus I have is on my daughter and for her to be free of all of this Pentecostal doom and gloom. \n\nRight now my husband left the house and I\u2019m not sure where he is. He said he needed time to think and needed time alone. It\u2019s just me and my daughter. I\u2019m looking at schools, and trying to get her enrolled in our public school district. We\u2019ve been watching movies all day. \n\nMy plan is, even if it feels uncomfortable, to put my foot down on this pentecostal stuff because I\u2019m not going to allow this nonsense to be pushed any further. Whenever he does return, I want to have a candid conversation on where he stands with this faith, with his parents and with the direction we want to go with our daughter. I\u2019m no longer going to be a pushover.", "What\u2019s a low profile honey badger?", "That\u2019s interesting. I\u2019m genuinely curious where she learned about purgatory from.", ">to keep peace amongst the family, we enrolled her... \n\nYou have kept and kept the peace so much, your inlaws assumed that your kid is theirs. Also, your husband is actually just like them. He is actually worried what  his mother's friends think... he slowly but surely have taken your voice by pretending to be non-religious and disarming your defences by promises he never intended to keep. If you want to save your marriage I would stop cold turkey every single religious ceremonies and tell your ils that they are 100% done in having a voice in raising your daughter.  You should also be not open minded with your family. They just take your mind and make you do what they want. In 2 years you have lost your right to raise your child with with your husband. You have made a right decision by NOT telling him. You told him actually, but he always deflected. So he was told. He wouldn't listened if you were telling him on the way. What you got to understand is that you cannot reason with these people or compromise. And yes, your husband is fanatically religious and mama's boy to top it off. He lied to you. I have no idea how your marriage is going to survive this cold turkey habit buster.", "Also many religious schools will fire an unmarried pregnant teacher. Even if her partner is another teacher at the same nothing happens to him", "Thank you for this, I needed this.", "I can\u2019t speak to primary or elementary schools, but some Jesuit universities definitely do. I did undergrad at a Jesuit school and we definitely had gay/trans professors.", "My daughter's Catholic high school did have a trans teacher. They also had a gay-straight alliance club (they had to call it the \"acceptance club\" instead of GSA) with official school sponsorship.", "Needing to call it the \u201cacceptance club\u201d means the school wasn\u2019t okay with it being outwardly for LGBTQIA+ people."]}
