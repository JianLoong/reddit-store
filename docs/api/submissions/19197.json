They just don\u2019t. Feeling like a fake post because of them.\n\n- in post, you say you and your sister were very close to your parents. Then in responses, you say sister was very distant and largely estranged. Which is it?\n\n- you claim the expenses of the home were dragging you down personally in a financial sense. But you were executor. And as executor, you\u2019d know that these expenses are paid for by the estate while the estate is active - and settling an estate and associated probate takes several months, at least in the US. \n\n- also on probate, you couldn\u2019t sell a home while in probate, it has to clear and be free of any claims. You don\u2019t mention timelines, but this again is months. \n\n- you claim little contact with your sister during all this. You were executor. You\u2019d need to be contacting her about the will and her inheritance. In all those conversations, the house never came up? Really?\n\nIn the end. YTA for not even communicating the intent and giving her a head\u2019s up. Didn\u2019t need to wait for her to gather funds, sell at market rate, but she should have at least been made aware.", "YTA  \nWould it have killed you to text her \"hey, thinking of selling the house, wanna go first?\"  \nAlso, why are you the only one to inherit from your parents? Did she get something else, or did you decide on your own to sell something that belonged to the both of you?", "YTA\n\nGiving her a heads up before you put the house on the market was a common courtesy between family.  A very obvious one. Even if you knew she didn\u2019t have the means or desire to buy the house, you should have told her in case she wanted to visit the place she grew up in one last time.", "YTA.\n\nYou knew your childhood home would be sentimental to her and at the very least you should have informed her of your plans. \n\nIf she would be unable to purchase the house from the estate you two could have discussed the impracticalities of keeping the home.", "YTA why didn\u00b4t you inform her about your plans? \n\nYou knew that she was attached to the house and did not even give her a chance before selling to a stranger\n\nSelling a house is an enormous task, it wasn\u00b4t like something you just woke up one day and did, you planned the sale and had time to give her first chance at it", "YTA\n\nSince you knew the house held sentimental value to her, the least you could have done was give her some sort of \"first right of refusal\" for it.\n\n\"I had an offer for the house for $X closing June 30. Do you want to buy it from the estate for $X+$1 before then?\" \n\nYou wouldn't have had to \"wait around\" if she couldn't get the money together by the closing date, but it would have been kind to at least give her the *opportunity* to buy, it rather than sell it to a stranger.", "Did your parents make you the executor of their will because they wanted you to be able to sell all of their stuff and have a financially easy life?\n\nOr did they assign you the position because they thought you would be responsible when dealing with it?\n\nKind of sounds like you were told that you were in charge of the family estate and immediately was like \"sweet windfall for me, glad that it's all mine!\"\n\nI can totally see your sister never taking to you again after you steal her inheritance with the battlecry of \"I'm legally allowed to do this!\"", "My grandfather did this and it still sucks to this day smh", "YTA. Obviously you told your sister after the fact\u2026 You had a long interim time to tell her you were thinking about it, planning it, it is now up for sale, and possibly already actually sold\u2026 None of that happened, what would be the reason for that?", "YTA. You sold her childhood home without even speaking to her first. Is that the brother you want to be?", "YTA. Legally you did nothing wrong. But as a brother you could have at least given her a heads up and discussed options with her.", "YTA. If you had a close relationship with your sister, selling the house should have come up in conversation. Legally you did nothing wrong but it's still an AH move.", "YTA honestly why hadn't you thougth about speaking to her before selling the house especially if it has a sentimental value to both of you.", "Its one thing if she wanted the house and was unable to afford it, its not obligatory you sell to her, but you never had that conversation so you didn't know she wanted it. Should have checked in. YTA", "Light YTA, you should have offered her the option to buy first.", "YTA. Even if she didn\u2019t want to buy it, telling her would have been the decent way to handle things. She could have at least said goodbye, maybe visited a last time. You obviously didn\u2019t need permission, but it would have been nice", "YTA, it sounds like you weren\u2019t even planning to split the proceeds of the sale with her until she was upset about the sale.", "INFO\n\nDid only YOU inherit the house?  While you are the executor, that doesn't mean that you get all the assets (including from the house sale).  I would want to know what the will says.  \n\nIf there isn't a will, then the estate is owned jointly by you and your sister.  Executor means you pay the bills, sign the papers, etc.  While legally, you could sell the house, you should consider your sister's feelings.  Just because something is legal doesn't mean it is morally right.\n\nI would find it very odd if your parents gave you the house without your sister getting something in return of equal value. Yet, you mention that you will use the proceeds to pay off your bills and that your sister doesn't have the funds to buy the house from the estate.\n\nAs the executor AND a brother, you should have asked your sister how attached she was to the house.  Instead, you have bulldozed through this without considering her feelings.\n\nIf the actual will states that you both get an equal share of everything, then yes you are an a-hole.  If the will states that only you get the house for some specific reason, then I would have recognized how painful this might be for your sister and ask her opinion.", "YTA, it wouldn't have hurt you just to ask your sister right? I understand you had the right to do so and why you sold it, but if you just communicated about this huge decision with your sister, this would not have happened.", "YTA I am presuming you never told her until after you had sold it, or this wouldn\u2019t be an issue and she could still buy it? Why would you do an entire house sale of your inherited family home and never once in all that time, even mention it in passing to your sister? Sales take a long time, it\u2019s unusual to sell a house from start to end in just a couple of weeks. \n\nIt seems like you purposely avoided telling her.\n\nEven if she didn\u2019t want to buy it, you would still talke about this sort of thing with them, they might want to go and have a last look around, collect things they had there.", "Yes, YTA.\n\nLosing your parents is stressful and I get that.  Definitely a rough time.  So you can be excused some level of screw-up here.  Just know that it was an error.\n\nWhen you are selling something - anything - that might have an emotional value to a family member, good manners requires you to let them buy it from you.  From the sound of things, you know that and are sorry (offered to split proceeds) so I would just offer an apology as well.", "Yta, it's a good thing your not close with your sister, because I doubt she'll have anything to do with you now.", "Somewhat YTA. Although you were listed as the executor of the estate and you had every legal right to sell, it would have been courteous to give your sister the opportunity to buy the house from you especially considering the sentimental value.\n\nI definitely understand wanting to get rid of it as the expenses of trying to maintain a second property can get pretty overwhelming, but I still think even just a quick \"Hey sis, before I sell do you want to take over our parents' house?\" would have been sufficient.\n\nRegardless, sorry for your loss.", "Very minimal YTA.  You should have let her know you were planning to sell it before you sold it to someone else.  Obviously, if she couldn't get her financing together before you wanted to sell, you would not be TA if you sold on your timing.", "YTA. You knew it was sentimental to both you and your sister and you sold it without even giving her a heads up. Also sounds like you were going to keep all the profits for yourself so double YTA.", "YTA. Yet another AITA that could have been completely avoided by a very short adult conversation.\n\nI strongly suspect that you were not sole inheritor of the property and are offering her the half she rightly owns but she had planned to buy you out and is upset you sold it. I suspect she will go legal on this one.", "You inherit or you are just the executor? If you are only the executor you are the YTA, because the house was only half yours..if you inherit then, the house is complety yours to sell or to do it whatever you want with it...aldo it would be nice to tell her before you do anything  in case she wants to buy it or use it and pay you some rent for your half", "Legally you did nothing wrong but yeah, you're a bit of the AH here. It would have been kind to give her a heads up or discuss with her. There were options, such as she buy it at market value and you get the profits or, you sell and split as you offered. The difference now with the latter is she was not given a choice. In the end, what is done is done, you cannot reverse it. I would send her a certified cheque of half the profits and that's it. She will cash it, regardless of how opposed she is. At least you can say you tried to fix your mistake ... after all, that is what it is ... a mistake.", "YTA. Whilst legally you did nothing wrong, morally you were extremely wrong and cruel", "YTA\n\nShe didn't tell you about her plans to buy the house but by the same token you didn't tell her that you plan to sell. How was she supposed to know that she should have told you before a certain time?", "YTA and your original plan wasn\u2019t even to split it with her?  Lol.    You don\u2019t want it and she does, sign it over to her and let her deal with the expense and stress.  Problem solved.  Or is it just about the money you\u2019d make?", "Yta but softly. Why haven't you been keeping your sister in the loop about the estate if it has been this big of a burden to you? She could have told you her plans to move into the house and helped support you during that transition but instead you made moves on your own.", "Ok the fact you and your sister did not discuss this before hand made you the AH on the sell of the house.  However, you offered to split those proceeds so now that it\u2019s done that\u2019s a non AH move and your sister is being the AH.  Try to patch it up.  ImHO,  your parents made you the executor because they believe you would communicate and treat your siblings fair.  Did you do that at all levels communicating?  Split proceeds?  Did you honor your parents wishes?  Really only you can answer the true question whether you acted selfishly or not.  What\u2019s done is done try to make amends with your family relationship.  \n\nEdited:  In light of additional comments made by OP. It doesn\u2019t sound like your sister made any effort to reconcile with y\u2019all\u2019s parents while they were I\u2019ll.  If that\u2019s the case NAH.  Since y\u2019all don\u2019t speak much not sure what else can be done.  Best of luck.", "YTA, and there was clear favouritism. There is a reason you didn't tell her before you sold it... that reason is because you are a selfish AH who didn't consider the feelings of anyone else you just thought about reaping the benefits...", "ESH\n\nYou should have told her you were planning on selling the house and given her a chance to buy it.  It was the family home.\n\nShe should have spoken up when she thought she might purchase the home.  She had a responsibility to tell you she was interested in the home.\n\nYou are both grieving the loss of your parents.  Everyone processes grief differently.\n\nI have no idea how long you waited before putting the house on the market.  That also makes a difference.  How long had you held onto the place?", "YTA. Executor is **not** the same as inheritor. Your parents didn\u2019t leave the house specifically to you, they left it to both of you. You\u2019re just in charge of making sure everything goes smoothly.\n\nYou should give her the money. You didn\u2019t sell the house, the estate did and you were the mouthpiece. The estate that your sister is entitled to half of.", "ESH. You both should have talked to each other. \n\nYou might have been the sole inheritor with no legal responsibility to consult your sister, but morally, even if she weren't planning on buying it from you, you owed her the chance to say goodbye to her old family home properly.\n\nShe should have told you that she wanted to buy the house from you, because...as far as she knew, you were keeping it!\n\n~~ETA: ...Wait, did you actually specifically inherit the house in their Will, or did you take it upon yourself as executor to liquidate the estate without talking to your coheir(s)?~~ Nevermind, I can see from your comments that you were named as the person who inherited the house.", "OK, you weren't under any obligation to tell her but it would have been a kindness t let her know. \n\nIF she wanted to buy it, it would have given her the chance to ay so, and even of she couldn't afford to do so it would have given her a bit of time to get used to that idea and to go back and 'say goodbye' if she wanted to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, NTA, but you could have handled to situation with more sensitivity (and so of course could your sister) You were probably both not at your best due to your bereavement . Also, as your sister is younger, I would guess that it was her home more recently than it was yours, and that makes a difference as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd suggest that you apologise to her for not having given her a heads-up, and explain that you weren't in a financial position to delay the same and had no idea she was thinking she might want to try to buy the house from the estate.", "YTA", "YTA.  Yes you are not required but you acknowledge the house had sentimental value to the both of you.\n\nIf you are no contact or low contact with your sister, I could see why you didnt tell her.  But if you do have a working relationship, then why didnt you say something if you knew she was attached to the house?  \n\nAcknowledging you are not required to seek her permission since your permissions as executor of the estate grants you the right to do what you deem appropriate.  I just think you lack the forethought and perhaps the emotional intelligence to forecast her (IMO) appropriate response.\n\nYouve caused as rift betwen you and sister.  A text to her \"hey im thinking of selling the house\" would have been so easy to send off and avoided all of this.", "\nAsshole. Bro u shouldn\u2019t have taken any decisions without consulting her. The house is as much yours as it is hers so she also has the right to make any decisions. It\u2019s low-key sad that u didn\u2019t ask her before deciding what u wanted to do.", "YTA yes", "NAH. You should probably have told your sister first, but like you said, you couldn't wait for her to buy it anyway. I don't blame her for being upset at the lost of the opportunity tho.", "NTA\n\nIt was your house -100% legally - that was sitting there for a year before it was sold. It\u2019s not clear from your post if you personally paid those expenses or the estate did.  She never said she would be interested in 1) living in it or 2) buying it. What did she think was going to happen? That you\u2019d keep paying for a house in a different state indefinitely?  After a year the estate is winding down - and she never said anything??\n\nMy guess is 1) she is sore that your inheritance was larger than hers and 2) she has a bit of a dreamy/self centered personality where everything should work out in her favor - you should have held onto that expensive home until she was ready to buy it and you should have read her mind that she wanted to buy it.\n\nShould you have told her you were selling it? Sure. Absolutely. That was a bad error on your part that she will make you feel bad for the rest of your lives. But that doesn\u2019t make you an A.", "At the Risk of getting Neg Karmaed, ESH and here's why:\n\n1. I won't call you a YTA because you inherited the house along with the debt that came from it.  you had every legal right to do with it as you wished however had I been in your shoes, I would have probably talked to my siblings about it and checked in to see if they either had things left in the house they wanted back or if they wanted to buy it outright.\n2. You and your sister did not talk about your plans with the house despite the obvious legal changes that occured due to the passing of your parents.  I understand that talking about the house right away makes you look like voltures, but surely your sister should have asked around to find out who to talk to about buying the house and settings things up as soon as possible.  Did she trully believe that house would remain in the market for a long time before she bought it?\n3. that house rushed your decision to sell it as it was costing you a lot of money to maintain it while living away from it.  If I had property that was burning a hole in my wallet, I'd rush to sell it off too as I wouldn't want to go in debt to maintain it.\n\nOP I don't think your situation is a YTA, I think you got dealt a shitty situation and that you and your sister should have communicated your intents better.", "NTA. I\u2019m going with this as you waited a year after they died to sell it. In that entire time your sister didn\u2019t mention to you plans to buy it from you.

If she cared so much, why didnt she reach out during the 1 year?", "Legally sound but still YTA.

Your basis in the home will be its value on the day you inherited it/the day your parents died.
