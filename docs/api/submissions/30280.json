They're both assholes and I don't think it's fair to immediately jump to the conclusion that OP is the victim. There's way more to this story than a blocked driveway and the neighbor parking too close.\n\nI also stand by my original comment that OP shouldn't have parked so close to the vehicle behind them. Good drivers know to leave space behind them in case another vehicle parks too close. OP is playing victim while instigating this continued conflict, which the AH neighbor willingly plays into.
