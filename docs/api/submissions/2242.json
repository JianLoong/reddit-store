I make about double what she does but ask her to pay for half of our very reasonable mortgage (540 each) and utilities (150-200 each). We both work full time. She makes about $60k and has a pretty high school loans balance that costs her 850 a month.  When it's all said and done this leaves her with about $45 a day budget. I also ask her to split things like groceries which we put on a joint cc in my name.  \n\nLately she's been talking about how low her bank account is and how stressed out she is.  She does things she likes such as go to yoga multiple times a week , goes to therapy weekly which I encourage, eats healthy foods etc.  She's taken this I'm going to do what I want and not sacrifice my mental health and happiness for money attitude.  This is fine but she said she might not be able to pay her personal card in full this month which stresses me out.\n\nI use the extra money I make to help us do nice things like vacations. For the past two years I have been taking most of my extra money paying down our mortgage which I should be able to pay off in the spring.  I have also gone on a few vacations by myself so I don't want to make it sound like I'm not also using the extra income for any fun.  The main motivation for paying off the mortgage is making both of our lives better by lowering our overall bills. I also plan on taking all the tax and whatnot  after the mortgage is paid off so she is only paying utilities.  \n\nMy position is she makes enough money to have a reasonable budget and should be able to stick to that.  Being financially responsible is a very important thing to me. I've tried to talk to her repeatedly about this but it always devolves into a fight about how I'm not in her Position and how I have money to do whatever I want etc. So AITA for expecting her to be able to pay basic bills and balance her income?\n\nEdit format\n\n\n\n2nd edit .   I should have probably mentioned in the original post that we both have been splitting things equally for years and this was the expectation when we moved in together in 2020.  Also the cost of the mortgage we split is significantly cheaper than her rent was prior to moving in.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal update.  Seems like responses are split for some but main takeaways here are \n\n\nEquitable % of mortgage and utilities seems more fair, I will look into this.  The fact that the mortgage is in my name is triggering some people here.  Sorry guys and gals I happened to buy a house before I met my SO, whoops.  \n\nWe should probably sit down and talk to a financial person, if nothing else maybe advice from a neutral 3rd person will be good for both of us to hear.\n\nThanks for those who had helpful thoughtful responses.

It would be more fair to split all household bills based on what percent of the household income you bring that month. If one month you don't do too well and make as much as her, then it would make sense for her to pay 50%. \nOn another note, a \"my money\" - \"your money\" approach might not be the best plan for maximum saving when it comes to combining your incomes in marriage.

If you\u2019re going to marry this person then you should build the kind of lifestyle that both of you want and can afford together. \n\nIf you\u2019re going to pay off the mortgage in a couple months then that frees up over $500/mo for her - that would seem like a pretty good place to start.", "I think it might help if you try and consider if yoga is a fun extra, or a necessity.

It's shocking to realize that holding a pose can be so tricky, you don't realize you're holding your breath.\n\nSpeaking of breathing, yoga makes you mindful of it.

It doesn\u2019t take much to alleviate stress when it comes to money and it also cuts down on the resentment she has presumably built up over you just sitting there and justifying her hardship.

If you love your fiancee and know she is financially struggling and you could ease that financial burden by decreasing her required/agreed upon payment to your mortgage without undue hardship... why wouldn't you? \n\nVery few people are saying she shouldn't be paying at all, just that the payments should be commiserate to what she can realistically afford.  And leaving aside the ideas of equity and renter's rights, if you aren't willing to support your fiancee during financial hardship (you know, \"through thick and thin\"), why are you even considering marriage?\n\nAlso, if she is making all of her obligatory payments to you, and is struggling with her own personal credit card (that you are in no way associated with and do not impact your finances in the slightest), why are you stressing out? (Also, paying your credit cards in full is not how you build credit - you should have a small balance on your credit card. It's stupid, and I don't know why, but thems there is the facts, so her not paying off her own personal credit card in full at the end of the month is not exactly the end of the world).\n\nAdditionally, you are 7 years older than her, and have had longer to attain the knowledge and income associated with financial stability. When I was 30, I was struggling like hell working two jobs to pay my car payments, student loans, rent, insirance, food, etc.  It wasn't until I was nearly 35 that I had a better understanding of my finances and had my debt under control (it's not like financial literacy is a class that students are required to take at any part in their education, so a lot of the things we learn are from trial and error. \n\nAnd just because you have a better grasp on your finances doesn't mean she will or wants to learn from your mistakes. I had to make many a financial mistake against the better judgment of my parent because they were mistakes I needed to make in order to grow and understand what works and what doesn't. I pass on the information I learned on my financial journey and sometimes people take it and sometimes they don't and have to learn on their own. Admittedly you are more invested in your fiancee's financial stability than I am for friends and co-workers, but if she is meeting her financial obligations to you and you are not married, ultimately she will need to learn some of these lessons on her own - as I assume you did.", "Because if she rented elsewhere she would have rights as a tenant.

He's treating her worse than a tenant, when he should be treating her better than a tenant. \n\nHe's benefitting significantly from her paying off half his mortgage.

I\u2019m not saying she shouldn\u2019t be paying at all. She should obviously contribute financially to the place she lives in, but she won\u2019t gain any equity in the house by paying 50% of a mortgage that isn\u2019t hers. And even if they were married, I would not feel comfortable paying 50% when my partner made double what I make. She\u2019s expressed that she\u2019s feeling financial pressure, and he should find a way to find a compromise.", "Technically if you\u2019re paying rent and living somewhere you become a month to month tenant. Is it shitty that people kick out their partners when they get into a fight, yes, but legally speaking they can\u2019t do that and people just don\u2019t know their rights or don\u2019t want to live there anyway and leave. If you\u2019re paying rent somewhere you\u2019re most likely paying off your landlords assets anyway.

He's her boyfriend and presumably they're planning a future together.

He letting his fiancee pay thousands towards his loan, significantly benefitting him with no acknowledgment of that. \n\nWhen a landlord gets a tenant it's a business transaction to pay off their investment.

A cohabition agreement is a legally binding document would outline this split. It's far better than having nothing in place. \n\nif the OP lived where I lived (UK) they would have made it very messy. A cohabiting partner paying outwards the mortgage could make a legal claim on it if there's no clear agreement in place, not sure if that risk exists in the US. That's why either no payments towards the mortgage or a deed of trust (UK equivalent to a cohabition agreement) outlining % split would be the only two options in my case.", "Exactly, ONLY a boyfriend, so if she did not put half the down payment and they are not married, why put her in for half and then she can split his mortgage, why she has to live rentless otherwise, completely unfair to the one paying!", "He could have had a roommate move in to help him instead of her and made her continue paying more in a rental. And in my state you still have to give notice to evict a tenant.  She didn't put money into the house to begin with, like the down payment. If anything goes wrong with the house, she can walk away free and clear. She doesn't have to pay to repair anything. She is benefiting by having more disposable income than she did when she rented.", "That's crazy.  Why should she live there for free?", "No objections to that - a tenant agreement is fair, no question. But a lot of the commenters didn\u2019t frame it as \u201eeither-or\u201c, but as absolute: your fianc\u00e9e shouldn\u2019t pay part of your mortgage, period. Like it\u2019s in any way reasonable for a working adult to live rent free just because her partner is the one paying off the house.", "Technically, if she has no ownership interest in the property and you do, you *are* her landlord.", "It would stills be her entering an agreement that grants her more rights and with full understanding of being a renter.", "But he didn't say he had her move in to be a tenant because he needed help paying the mortgage, I would presume they live together because they're engaged. That's what the OP would strongly imply. \n\nThat's what I said, she has rights as a tenant. Therefore he couldn't just kick her out if she had a lease. However she currently isn't a tenant so he can kick her out. She's paying money to him with no rights like a tenant would have and no % of the equity.\n\nAlso I wouldn't treat a partner the same I would a tenant. It's a personal relationship. Having a tenant is strictly business. I guess that's just my personal opinion...\n\nWhat does it matter if she paid towards the mortgage instead of down payment? It's still money going towards the asset. About $13,000 (probably more) and counting is not insignificant.   \n\nYeah she walks away and doesn't have to pay anything, because she's not the owner, but he gets to keep the $13,000 she's paid towards his house and retain full ownership. I've asked OP a few times what happens with all the money she's paid towards his house if they break up and he hasn't responded. He talks about overpaying and having money for solo holidays as if that's nothing to do with the fact that he's only paying half his repayments with no reduction in ownership.\n\nHe keep talking about all the benefits to her thanks to him overpaying, without acknowledging that she's contributing to that without him giving her any rights. He'll pay his mortgage off early which means he pays less in interest thanks to her, except he doesn't thank her.
