I make about double what she does but ask her to pay for half of our very reasonable mortgage (540 each) and utilities (150-200 each). We both work full time. She makes about $60k and has a pretty high school loans balance that costs her 850 a month.  When it's all said and done this leaves her with about $45 a day budget.

She does things she likes such as go to yoga multiple times a week , goes to therapy weekly which I encourage, eats healthy foods etc.  She's taken this I'm going to do what I want and not sacrifice my mental health and happiness for money attitude.  This is fine but she said she might not be able to pay her personal card in full this month which stresses me out.\n\nI use the extra money I make to help us do nice things like vacations. For the past two years I have been taking most of my extra money paying down our mortgage which I should be able to pay off in the spring.  I have also gone on a few vacations by myself so I don't want to make it sound like I'm not also using the extra income for any fun.  The main motivation for paying off the mortgage is making both of our lives better by lowering our overall bills. I also plan on taking all the tax and whatnot  after the mortgage is paid off so she is only paying utilities.  \n\nMy position is she makes enough money to have a reasonable budget and should be able to stick to that.  Being financially responsible is a very important thing to me. I've tried to talk to her repeatedly about this but it always devolves into a fight about how I'm not in her Position and how I have money to do whatever I want etc. So AITA for expecting her to be able to pay basic bills and balance her income?\n\nEdit format\n\n\n\n2nd edit .   I should have probably mentioned in the original post that we both have been splitting things equally for years and this was the expectation when we moved in together in 2020.  Also the cost of the mortgage we split is significantly cheaper than her rent was prior to moving in.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal update.  Seems like responses are split for some but main takeaways here are \n\n\nEquitable % of mortgage and utilities seems more fair, I will look into this.  The fact that the mortgage is in my name is triggering some people here.  Sorry guys and gals I happened to buy a house before I met my SO, whoops.  \n\nWe should probably sit down and talk to a financial person, if nothing else maybe advice from a neutral 3rd person will be good for both of us to hear.\n\nThanks for those who had helpful thoughtful responses.  To those folks who are like why would a woman pay any rent all I can say is good luck out there !\n\n\nThis got more popular than expected so decided to make one last update.  Based on comments here I'm going to offer to pay 2/3rds mortgage and utilities which should free up more $ for her immediately to help with stress and be more equitable.  I left this out of the original post but I'm also planning on paying her car note off this month for the same reason.   This will benefit her more immediately and directly than paying off the mortgage quite as fast. \n\n  I have to say some of y'all have no idea how houses work.  You don't just throw someone on the deed , it doesn't work like that.  Also I owned the house for 8 years before we met and if she wasn't helping pay the mortgage at this cheap house she wouldn't be magically living for free or cheaper elsewhere.

Why should she pay half of she brings 1/3 of the income? Sure, you made an agreement a couple years ago, but with your fluctuating income, a fluctuating bills expectation makes sense.  It would be more fair to split all household bills based on what percent of the household income you bring that month. If one month you don't do too well and make as much as her, then it would make sense for her to pay 50%. \nOn another note, a \"my money\" - \"your money\" approach might not be the best plan for maximum saving when it comes to combining your incomes in marriage.

If the OP lived alone and decided to get a roommate, he puts out an ad and starts talking to someone and they have similar hobbies and seems like they are a good fit for a roommate. The guy moves in and pays rent. Should he go on the mortgage? No of course not. It\u2019s the same thing.

But moving into their fianc\u00e9's house and suddenly they don't think they should contribute half that amount to a mortgage that will eventually become theirs once they are married. \n\nI think it really exemplifies that women truly see their man as a resource and start relationships with the notion of what benefits them the most over anything else.", "You\u2019ve invested so much time and energy trying to convince total strangers that you\u2019re not the asshole, that it\u2019s clear that you are.

He makes well above that threshold, while she doesn\u2019t even make close to that.  His level of empathy and conscientiousness towards his fianc\u00e9 is childish, selfish, and appalling.  But worse, it\u2019s lacking financial basic knowledge of her spending and the actual reality of where that puts her financially in the world she\u2019s currently living in (esp for a female, where existing is simply more expensive, even more so with the cost of living going up so exponentially in such a short period of time).  Therefore it\u2019s not even pragmatic.  Everything is relative, and her spending responsibly should be geared towards covering her basic needs, followed by her caring for a sound body and mind.  Which it sounds like she\u2019s doing - it suggests she\u2019s following Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs and that she doesn\u2019t have much to spend on enjoying her life beyond simply functioning in it.  Nothing suggests that she doesn\u2019t manage her money well.  For someone who acts so self righteous about financial responsibility, you should really be asking OP smarter questions, bc with all due respect, your position so far suggests you don\u2019t have a great touch point on trying to manage a sound financial strategy on a salary that\u2019s below living wage in this current economy.", "Swapping to 1/3 shifts it by like $100 - this isn't some end-all be-all financial solution in practice in this situation.

You say she has about $315 left over each week for her fun money. Set her an account up and put $400 per week in that account, and the rest goes to a joint account. Do the same for you. You each get $400 per week to play with, and the rest goes to bills. At the end of each month when the bills are paid, you can take the rest of the money from that account and put into a joint vacation / max money account. This way, you each have plenty of money for the day to day splurges, and you can discuss what to do with the other money as a couple / family.

I think that is more fair given your income and it is very nice to you to help with her bills afterwards, as well. I hope she\u2019s accepting of that compromise.\n\nAlso, just another point \u2014 does she ever need particular expensive snacks or eat more than you? If this isn\u2019t already included in the 2/3 split, I think the groceries should be adjusted, assuming she is eating less food than you (ofc it\u2019s different for everyone though). I just find that in my personal experience, usually females eat less than their partners and I would feel uncomfortable paying 50% of groceries knowing my partners eats\u2026 say, 75% or whatever of what we buy (he\u2019s a major snacker and eats like 3+ meals a day haha).

So he probably is paying 2/3 already. This is honestly the best thing for everyone since the house is (in most states) separate property and using his money to get out from under the mortgage makes things a lot more fair if they ever divorce.", "How is this ?", "OP is better set in life than 99% of people on this sub, he'd be better off taking the advice and doing the exact opposite.", "Exactly.
