I make about double what she does but ask her to pay for half of our very reasonable mortgage (540 each) and utilities (150-200 each). We both work full time. She makes about $60k and has a pretty high school loans balance that costs her 850 a month.  When it's all said and done this leaves her with about $45 a day budget. I also ask her to split things like groceries which we put on a joint cc in my name.  \n\nLately she's been talking about how low her bank account is and how stressed out she is.  She does things she likes such as go to yoga multiple times a week , goes to therapy weekly which I encourage, eats healthy foods etc.  She's taken this I'm going to do what I want and not sacrifice my mental health and happiness for money attitude.  This is fine but she said she might not be able to pay her personal card in full this month which stresses me out.\n\nI use the extra money I make to help us do nice things like vacations. For the past two years I have been taking most of my extra money paying down our mortgage which I should be able to pay off in the spring.  I have also gone on a few vacations by myself so I don't want to make it sound like I'm not also using the extra income for any fun.  The main motivation for paying off the mortgage is making both of our lives better by lowering our overall bills. I also plan on taking all the tax and whatnot  after the mortgage is paid off so she is only paying utilities.  \n\nMy position is she makes enough money to have a reasonable budget and should be able to stick to that.  Being financially responsible is a very important thing to me. I've tried to talk to her repeatedly about this but it always devolves into a fight about how I'm not in her Position and how I have money to do whatever I want etc. So AITA for expecting her to be able to pay basic bills and balance her income?\n\nEdit format\n\n\n\n2nd edit .   I should have probably mentioned in the original post that we both have been splitting things equally for years and this was the expectation when we moved in together in 2020.  Also the cost of the mortgage we split is significantly cheaper than her rent was prior to moving in.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal update.  Seems like responses are split for some but main takeaways here are \n\n\nEquitable % of mortgage and utilities seems more fair, I will look into this.  The fact that the mortgage is in my name is triggering some people here.  Sorry guys and gals I happened to buy a house before I met my SO, whoops.  \n\nWe should probably sit down and talk to a financial person, if nothing else maybe advice from a neutral 3rd person will be good for both of us to hear.\n\nThanks for those who had helpful thoughtful responses.

It would be more fair to split all household bills based on what percent of the household income you bring that month. If one month you don't do too well and make as much as her, then it would make sense for her to pay 50%. \nOn another note, a \"my money\" - \"your money\" approach might not be the best plan for maximum saving when it comes to combining your incomes in marriage.

Also 50/50 doesn't work when one partner earns significantly more money. % of income is more appropriate.\n\nEdit to add: if she is actively paying into your mortgage/equity for as long as you are married she'll be entitled to whatever she contributes if she keeps the receipts of payment. Unless you get a pre-nup in which she would be foolish to contribute to your mortgage.", "She'd have more rights paying rent to a landlord than she does paying money to you. It's not equivalent. Also she's your future wife, not a tenant paying money towards an investment property in a business transaction.\n\nI can't see where you've acknowledged that this arrangement significantly benefits you because your repayments have halved without any impact on % ownership and it's allowing you to overpay on the mortgage. It's also freed up cash for you to go on solo holidays. If the relationship ends, she's helped you to repay your mortgage without anything to show for it.", "First of all, she is your fianc\u00e9e, not your tenant so it is not paying you rent for the home. I think that\u2019s the biggest red flag here. The possessiveness towards someone you are about to marry seems weird to me. Like isn\u2019t marriage supposed to be for richer or for poorer? Second, maybe talk to her about her spending and come to a compromise. There are going to be so many issues you will need to compromise on, finances being at the top. I think what\u2019s most important here is to understand the root of why you do what you do and learn to adjust based on joining your life with another person. I make double what my husband makes but we have a joint account so there\u2019s no identifying who\u2019s paying what for which things. This is just the way we do things. You have to figure out what works best for the both of you instead of just what you think is best. Talk to a therapist. Talk to a financial counselor. But do it together.", "A lot of people are pointing out the equity that she is not getting that you are, and that\u2019s their issue with the mortgage specifically. How much has the houses value increased in the last 3 years or however long since she moved in? And how does that compare to the amount of mortgage mandatorily paid? (Not the extra you are putting in). 3 years at $547 = 19,692 paid in by each of you.  Have you earned that back in equity? I would guess that you have. I would guess given market trends that the house is worth more than $20k more than you bought it for. You will get back more than you paid. She just paid. That\u2019s their point, and your point is she\u2019d have paid that elsewhere. True. But you aren\u2019t her landlord, you\u2019re her partner - changes the impact. \n\nNow, I\u2019m just trying to give perspective and figures help me. I think NTA but \u2026 you guys are not on the same page financially and that is one of the main reasons for discord in relationships. You said she\u2019s not budgeting and not changing spending, which is problematic. A fiduciary may be a good call, perhaps hearing it from a neutral third party would be more effective.\n\nEdit: house is worth more than 20k more than it was when she moved in, not when you bought it as you bought it before she moved in.", "We have all told you what the issue is. If you can\u2019t wrap your brain around it, that\u2019s a you issue", "Yep. Currently he can kick her out with no notice and he's quids in because she's paid off a chunk of his loan and he still gets 100% of the asset when it's paid off.", "Financial pressure. The credit is in *your name*. If you break up, she loses everything-as nothing here is in *her name*. You have the power and control here. That means pressure on the other person. Pressure to pay *your* mortgage, pressure to pay *your* credit. The idea of a financial advisor is smart-you need a professional 3rd party opinion so this situation is fair.", ">How am I putting financial pressure on her when nothing has changed in two years?\n\nBy pushing back on her therapy and yoga, two very beneficial things for your future spouse, based on how you find them financially irresponsible.  I can totally see her giving in, months passing, and another post going up complaining about how your now unhinged spouse has let herself go.", "We didn't have a lease because we live together I'm not her landlord.   We did openly discuss and agree on the payment before she moved in .  She was more than okay with it because as stated elsewhere it was actually saving her money", "But she\u2019s paying less to live with him than she used to pay in rent, so she has more disposable income to pay off her debts or use for spending money. That\u2019s an advantage she has by living with him, and there\u2019s no reason why he should be sponsoring a home for her.", "So what's the difference? If they owned a home, she is not entitled to THEIR equity. Ever hear of divorce? Half of all couples married end in divorce. Her chances of finding a room for $500 a month now is probably nearly impossible unless she lives at home.", "LOL. Judge Judy says it best.. the courts aren't here to work out what happens between non-married people. In the eyes of the law, they aren't married, so she is paying rent. What is she paying into if she was single and living on her own more expensively? Hmm? No equity there. She's a rent payer, and just so happens to be in love with the owner. She's not entitled to his equity. And I doubt she'd find a roommate who was willing to do that.", "how many times a week do we see posts where one half of a non-marriage relationship thinks they should live for free in the home owned by the other half? everyone jumps down their throats about it. \n\n[not to be confused with posts of people being asked to contribute towards the down without being on the deed. that's different and not okay.] \n\nwould it be nice if op let her live there for free? yeah. would i let my partner live for free? probably. do i think op *has* to? nah. \n\nso what if her paying rent means op can pay his mortgage off sooner? it's already a benefit for the both of them. he saves money because she's chipping in, and she saves money because she's still paying less than she would anywhere else. sure, he could probably pay off his house even faster if he had a market-rate roommate, but a gf is better than a roommate any day of the week. \n\nlike you mentioned her not having any recourse if they break up? what if she's living for free for a few years and then breaks up with op once her loans are paid off? op could have had a roommate that whole time, lol.\n\nnow obviously op's partner still isn't happy with their current agreement, so they should definitely crunch numbers and talk about it. but i would consider it a red flag if the only solution she'll accept is not paying anything.", "She'd have more rights as a tenant than she would as his partner.\n\nHer paying into his mortgage has significant benefits for him which he doesn't seem to acknowledge. He's only paying half his repayments, without any reduction in equity. And it's allowing him to overpay, reducing the overall interest payable. But he won't even put her name on the deed in return. \n\nIf they were in the UK she could be entitled to the equity. If could prove she paid towards the house (whether by mortgage repayments or maintenance) a court may grant her some interest.", "Oh cool!!! So she is living in his house for less than she would pay for rent anywhere else AND she only has to pay that until he pays it off in the spring, then she lives rent free?! Sounds like a sweet deal!! If she can't afford rent and utilities of $700 a month, maybe she should downsize and get a roommate.\n\nETA $540 a month rent for 2 years to marry and have no debt is outstanding. Let's see her get that from a landlord. You people are wild and crazy selfish.", "Why?  If I drew up a lease would you say she shouldn't be paying that and just live for free ?", "I do not see any other split in advance, how much can he give her right at the begining NOT knowing if their relationship is gonna last? And then he is f...d if they break up before the apartment is paid off, even after it is paid off unless she also split the downplayment with him!", "So if she needs a rental agreement, which she doesn't want, you would feel differently?", "She has less disposable income now because her salary is $20K lower than before.\n\nAnd even if her disposable income was now higher, I can\u2019t imagine telling the person I expect to marry that I *could* help them keep paying for therapy, at no burden to myself, but I won\u2019t because the financially responsible thing to do is for them to quit.", "If you drew up a formal lease, that would be different because leases come with rights.", "The equity paid up to the start of her paying is allocated as his, the remaining equity (during the time they were paying half and half) is split 50/50, deducing any overpayments he's made.\n\nIt more complicated than a 50/50 split but nothing a good solicitor can't deal with (if US law allows for it of course).\n\nAnd if he's financial sensible like he says he is it should be easy to document.", "My personal feelings on the matter? She should be setting that money aside until she gets named on the property. Then she can pay that money into the property and an appropriate ownership split can be agreed and legally documented. That how I would approach it if a partner moved in with me at first. \n\nI wouldn't have a partner named as a lodger (although I don't think UK law allows for that so probably a moot point) anyway because it would make me uncomfortable to be acting as my partner's landlord but then I wouldn't be asking them to pay towards my mortgage without some kind of legal agreement in place to make things fair. \n\nAt the very least she should be getting financial advice from someone. An independent professional who can act in her best interests.  \n\nIf you break up next week say, do you retain the benefit of her paying thousands off your mortgage?", "But it was her choice to lower her income - a choice she apparently didn\u2019t discuss with him. So she gets to make unilateral decisions concerning her income, and he gets to fund them? That doesn\u2019t seem equitable."]}
