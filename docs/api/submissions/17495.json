I think you did the right thing setting boundaries. I think that before doing something like this again you should talk to your brother about him taking your food and how that makes you feel.", "NTA - If he is so stuck on \"fair\" I'd ask him how is it fair that you have to cook for him and perform the labor to cook FOUR sausages but only get to eat TWO. If he wants \"fair\" he should perform is own cooking labor or ask the person legally obligated to care for him (his parent). What do you get from this transaction? Nothing. If he wants two sausages, he should be providing something other than whininess in return to make it actually fair, like washing the cooking dishes or helping you somehow if he is unable to cook them himself due to his disability (At 13 a neurotypical child is able to use a pan, but I do not know your brother so i cannot speak to his cooking abilities)", "Nta... life ain't fair and if he keeps getting pampered to... life is gonna hit him like a bag of bricks", ">He has autism, ocd, and other anger management issues that resulted in him having a complex about everything being \"fair\"\n\nAsk him how this is fair to you - you take out the portion of food you want, you cook them, what is he doing to earn half of them? It isn't \"fair\" that he gets half of everything you have just because you have it. \n\n>My brother had the options of pizza pops, cereal, crackers, toast, etc\n\nAgain, ask how it's fair that he has multiple options but that you have to share the only quick option you have on hand. \n\nWhile you're not his parent, you can still use this as a teachable moment seems your mother obviously isn't. If his brain works on what's fair, show him how him taking part of your food isn't fair. \n\nNTA", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility to feed him.", "NTA autistics don\u2019t deserve special treatment.

Using applied behavioral therapy to work on making this manageable for him would benefit everyone.", "NTA \n\nYou were a jerk for pretending you would give him sausage but I understand why you did it.

She's mad because although you were right, it made extra work for her. She needs to step up.", "Nta 'no' is an answer to a question. A 13yo can absolutely be told no.  If he wants something to eat he can prepare it. He's a 13yo with autism, he isn't an idiot. \n\nIf he's all stuck on fair, start demanding half his food.  It's *fair* isn't it?

No. But you're 16 and trying to stick up for yourself verbally hasn't worked, so I see this as a cry for help from your mom.", "NTA\n\nTell your mom that your brother needs to go see \u00e0 professionnal if she can't teach boundaries and social normes.\n\nThey are really important for living in our society and he's dangerously closed to the worst part of social life: between middle and high school.\n\nIf he can't learn at home with his family, what will happen when he will be alone in public?", "NTA,and tell your mom to stop babying him and make him responsible for making his own food. So sorry they are doing this to you.", "I am probably going against the grain but YTA, At 16  your old enough to be considerate of your mom and younger brother, whether disabled or not. How hard would it be for you to take out an extra 4 pack and make those with yours? No extra cooking, just doing it at the same time. Sounds selfish to me.", "don\u2019t pretend to give him some, just say it\u2019s your food (because it is). you don\u2019t have to bend to everything just because his brain works differently, but pretending to give him food and leaving your mom to deal with the fallout is rude and irresponsible. so even given all that yta", "INFO: is there a reason your brother isn't cooking his own food? is he incapable of taking care of his own needs?\n\nI'm currently leading towards NTA with the information you've provided.", "NTA. He\u2019s autistic, not stupid.

They\u2019re the same ones that think neurodivergence entitles you to being bubble wrapped and coddled with every exception made for your issues.

But\u2026 wouldn\u2019t the solution just be to make 8 each time?   Then you can eat your four and he can have some too.  As far as I know those are easy enough to cook that there\u2019s no extra effort with 8 versus 4.", "Are you an arse for wanting to eat your own food? No. \n\nAre you an arse for tricking your brother? Yes.  \n\nAsk your family to start putting six or eight sausages in a pack so you can split it and still get your fill.", "Yta for purposely teasing your brother.  This has a simple solution....\n\nAll your brother if he wants some and at another portion, or all your mom to portion them into 6 instead of 4.  \n\nYou're fighting just to fight.

Remember that.\n\nIntentionally triggering him because your mom isn't parenting isn't a good look.", "Yes, that sounds aggravating. But to me what makes YTA was pretending you\u2019d give him two but then took 3 of the 4 and locked yourself in your room. You admit that you knew he would \u201cmake [your mom\u2019s] evening hell\u201d. \n\nIf this is a recurring problem, ask your mom to freeze packages of 6 sausages (4 for you, 2 for brother, or however many you each want).", "YTA - You purposefully triggered him. \n\nCommunicate with your mom about what you need.", "YTA for the specific thing you did. If you just said, \"I don't want to share anymore\" that would be one thing. Also, I assume your mom is the one that buys the food, so even with your allergies they're not really explicitly \"yours\" so you don't get to call dibs. Also they're like, breakfast sausages, the effort it took to make them is minimal.\n\nPlus, you know how your brother is. If somebody knew you really hated the color blue, and always gave you blue things for gifts, wouldn't they be the A? Getting mad at him for not reacting the way you want him to isn't going to solve anything and is as much of an A move imo. I understand the annoyance that builds up over time having to deal with someone that doesn't seem to interact the same way you do, and sibling relationships are one of the most fraught, weird, toxic relationships on earth tbh. I will say this is something that might happen no matter if your sibling is autistic or not. This whole situation is relatable and tons of us have gone through it. Siblings also just like doing what their siblings are doing. You're not the worst person in the world, but your action was an A move.\n\nIn the future, why don't all three of you guys actually sit down and talk about what's fair? You ought to be able to discuss with your mom what foods you need to have available to you, and your brother ought to be able to say what food he wants available, and your mother ought to be able to say what she can or is willing to provide. You guys are both old enough to talk about this logically. And then once you've established rules you can stick by them and change them as necessary. I have to imagine there's resources online for having conversations like this with people like your brother. And he needs to understand that you guys actually have different needs and so will need different things, so everything won't be split exactly 50-50. But instead of fighting it so hard just find ways you guys are all ok with splitting things in a still fair way.", "YTA - you purposefully set him off by \"pretending you would give him 2.\" Time to grow up.", "YTA if your mom pays for those sausages.\n\nYour brother is too but it's not about him. The extra context makes no sense. If you want 4 sausages then just thaw two packs and make 8 instead of constantly being surprised.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mean.. you're not an asshole. This is probably hard AF but you're making it harder than it has to be.", "Your mom pays for the food. She makes packets of 4 breakfast sausages. Why? Because that is 2 for you and 2 for your brother. This is not hard to figure out. It's basic math!\n\nYTA!", "YTA \n\nYou know he can\u2019t process it and triggered him.\nStart packing those sausages in packs of 6 .\n\nAnd what is with regular food in the fridge?

I don't disagree that the 13yo is an asshole for sure but ultimately this seems to affect the mom more than anything. She is making her moms life harder for not much gain. In my mind unless she has a shitty mom that kind of makes her an asshole.", "No, the brother needs to learn that he cannot always get what he wants and the special treatment autistic people require is definitely not complete lack of consequences for their actions."]}
