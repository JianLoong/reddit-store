Your dad was right to support you in this. If your mom wanted to make food that wasn't tasteless mush out of consideration for the rest of you, she would have. Cookbooks and cooking videos are everywhere. \n\nMy ex's mom would do this, she was convinced that \"spicy\" (ie.: anything with flavor) food was less healthy.

Good on your for stepping up and doing that stuff for yourself; not only learning to cook what you like, but getting the job to pay for it as well. I'm thinking your mum is just insecure, because otherwise, that's 100% something to be proud of for your kid! \n\nIn helping to mend the rift (not that it should be on you, but parents sometimes get pig-headed) I would maybe suggest asking her to cook WITH you. Use it as a bonding moment, but don't come off as teaching her. Just say you want to spend the time with her.

A family is about balancing the needs to the group with the needs of the individual. A lot of things like time, money, stress contribute to what she may feels she\u2019s able to serve you for meals. But it\u2019s her job to provide you with food but that does not mean she can also intimidate you into forcing down food you hate. So, you did exactly as she asked. You took responsibility and learned an extremely valuable life skill. You found a new talent, a hobby where you can be creative and learn to take care of yourself at the same time! She should be thrilled. She\u2019s probably feeling a bit jealous bc even if her food is not delicious, it is work and often mentally exhausting to prepare food for a family day in and day out (mom of littles here.) But it\u2019s not right to take that out on your kids. She\u2019s handled this all wrong.

It's weird, she has all these BS ideas of a good Christian wife submitting to her husband, but then gets super offended when he doesn't go along with whatever script she and her church have, so him interfering into domestic sphere can be hit or miss.", "I mean, if I could exchange my other chores for this one.

You can thank a man called John Harvey Kellogg for a lot of that. He was obsessive over people having sex and thought it was demonic.
