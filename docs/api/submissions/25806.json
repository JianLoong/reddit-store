It's not that she won't see your point. It's that she's consciously choosing to refuse to see your point. It's basic bullying behavior. Your mother has an issue with you that has no basis in reality. She bullies you in order to make herself feel better or get what she wants.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with your food or your or your dad. The problem is with your mother. You can't place expectations on her because she will not react like a normal person would. She's not reacting like a normal person would because she is irrational.\n\nI suggest reading the sub r/raisedbynarcissists because the parent having an issue with a child's food is a discussed issue. Your mother doesn't have to be a narcissist for you to read the sub. It just has already discussed examples of your mother's behavior. The information might help you address the situation.\n\nIn any case, no one is allowed to randomly call you names. Especially not your mother. Giving birth to you doesn't give her an insult pass to use whenever she wants. She 100% has no right to take her anger out on anyone else. There also comes a point where repeatedly asking someone the same or different things can turn into asking them to treat you like an equal human being with basic respect. Asking your mother not to insult you or what you cook is at that point. You deserve much more than you've been given.\n\nI don't know how to handle your situation. But, the best advice I can give is to view her like a tantruming toddler. Why? Because, like a toddler, your Mom currently lacks the emotional regulation to make proper decisions about how she feels. Her words don't mean anything in the same way a tantruming toddlers does. There's no use in getting angry at her because she's not worth the effort.", "What in the mayo is too spicy and who put raisins in the potato salad is going on here?

So why aren't you cooking for the whole family instead of making it some kind of weird competition with your mother? \n\nESH. All of you seem to have really petty, terrible attitudes about eachother and what is means to nourish someone.", "NTA.", "Dunno, I feel I am one unseasoned green beans casserole and sweet potato marshmallow abomination away from food poisoning, so it might actually kill me. Seriously, WTF with the sweet potato marshmallow thing? How is it food?", "We've suffered for YEARS!!!! DECADES!!!", "Happens all the time, for some reason she thinks I'm meek and gutless, and will fall in line cause she is an adult, and then acts all surprised when I do something to show her I won't obey her just cause.", "I wanna become a surgeon, so don't know about a profession, but at least I won't have to suffer through the boring cafeteria food in college. Guess I need to choose a school with a big Asian diaspora so I can make some friends there and get new recipes.", "She hates the food that I make((( I think she really thinks her food is good and the rest of the fam is just wrong for liking Asian food better.", "Yep, that's why I am teaching my lil' bro. That'll totally piss her off.", "Might be. Might be also cause she wanted a perfect little lady like her and got, well, me. And my lil sis is only four, so it'll be a while before she can do a re-do, the rest are boys.", "Dad wants me to cook for the family now, that's why he gave me money for groceries. Mom is the one who doesn't want me to cook for the rest of them, and why they are fighting.", "That's sad. I'm sorry this is happening to you. I use my mother as an example of what not to do with my own daughter. Hope your mother comes to her senses and accepts you for who you are.  One love \u270c\ufe0f", "Yeah, protecting my fam from the evil cumin and cardamon? The diabolic clutches of some turmeric? Is it the curry powder that'll be my eternal damnation? It'll be one tasty damnation!", "i know people like this, like goddamn they're missing out on so many good foods out there.", "Kekeke I feel you, just trying to offer another perspective", "I'm eastern European and our traditional food is pretty mushy, bland and oversalted (due to salt being literally the only spice besides a few herbs available back in the day to majority of the population and the fact that a lot of it is using as much of what you have as possible, like offal). A lot of is focused on extracting as much taste as possible from ingredients at hand and it's rather subtle. But it's good comfort food because that's what I grew up on. Feels real bad when your country's traditional food is always dismissed as \"bad cooking\" because it doesn't use spices or bold flavours.", "I DID! I even go to the Global Foods Market! And some specific Asian stores to get the rarer ingredients! The shame. The audacity.", "She won't touch raw tuna with a ten foot pole, and it's delish!", "I'm from eastern European roots and I'd pretty much disagree. Yeah, there are some dishes that are casserole and stew based (and honestly, what is wrong with that, they can be really tasty), but there are also heaps that aren't and have great textures. Paprika, caraway, juniper, thyme, bay leaf, pepper, and so on have been used commonly in Europe - even eastern Europe - since the 17th Century.", "Also eastern EU roots and I've always found the food really flavourful? Its when my family tries to cook western food does it go to shit", "And \u201cyeah right\u201d is a \u201cno\u201d", "&#x200B;\n\nYeah nah, and nah yeah. But also yeah can be used as a \"I get what you're saying but....\" rather than a \"yes I agree\"."]}
