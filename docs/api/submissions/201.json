We also have my son (2.5m) and a newborn daughter who is now 3 weeks old. Alex moved in with us back in may.\n\nWhen alex asked to move in with us, we agreed as long as there was some ground rules: clean up after yourself (throw away own trash and keep his bathroom clean. We let him have his own bathroom as a way to compensate for him having to sleep on the couch. We have a 2 bed 2 bath apartment and my toddler has the other room), save up for his own car, and keep all dangerous items out of reach of the kids hands. We didn't ask for rent or any household chores to be done.\n\nWell, in the 6 months he's been here, he has failed to do any of what we asked of him. His bathroom is always gross and he doesn't throw his trash away or take care of his opened snacks/dishes. He does work, but has no money saved up. He spends it on weed and junk food. We have had MULTIPLE talks with him about this with no change.\n\nThe last couple of months we have fallen into some financial hardship due to the rising costs of living and me being off work for maternity leave. We talked to alex saying that we will need his help both financially and with the dog/house after the baby is born. He agreed to help out. I also had a very traumatic c-section. He has not been helping like he agreed to. \n\nWe applied for some emergency state relief to help until we got back on our feet, but we needed Alex's pay stubs or a note from his manager to get it because he is a member of the household. He had over 2 weeks to get either one. He didn't do it despite us reminding him many times and stressing how important it was and why. He kept saying he would get it, but was always at his friends house and when he did work he still didnt get it. The deadline came and they canceled the application. Alex screwed us badly and despite our talks with him, he does not seem to care at all. \n\nSo now we are in a very tough position. Alex causes a lot of stress and grief when he is here and even causes issues in mine and daves relationship. Alex also treats his dad like crap and makes him feel terrible for really stupid stuff. There's so much more i cant fit here too.\n\nBoth of us agreed we dont want him living with us, but at the same time this is daves kid and he does love him despite how much he pisses dave off. He's also only 20 years old so its not like he has his life together. Problem is he doesn't seem to be trying either. I know he can be a good kid if he tries and i really do want him to be successful in life, but he is making our lives hell. I also don't want to leave him without a roof over his head, even though he told me he has somewhere to go if we lose the apartment.

You likely are more like a peer in his eyes, and it's probably frustrating to navigate that. \n\nI would first make the effort to talk about it, maybe with a counselor. And also have his father be the one who is having these chats with him about his responsibilities in the home. He's also an adult at at this point, so all of you should be able to have an adult conversation. \n\nAnd you need to understand that due to the age gap, and you being closer in age to Alex, your relationship will likely need to reflect that fact.

It would be better if he knew in advance that his failure to meet specific benchmarks, like providing the pay stubs or paying some rent, would lead to him being kicked out.

Thank you for your input", "Alex had his own room at the last place he lived, but hated it there and for good reason. He asked us, knowing that all we had was a couch for him.

I also have no desire to play mom to him lol he already has one of those. These rules are what i would expect out of anyone i live with, just as they would expect out of me.

I know it probably is a bit weird for him lol i wasn't exactly expecting this either but he and his sister (he has a 17 year old sister that chose to live with her mom) came with my partner and i accepted them from the beginning. He already has a mom and is grown so doesn't need another. We're more like buddies/roomates kinda? We get along for the most part.

He probably has a shitty lowpaying job, he is being asked to help his dads new family, and on top of that his dads new woman is \u201colder sibling\u201d age and they have had 2 kids back to back.

Yes, you are not his mother and your husband should deal with him. That doesn't mean you don't have the right to be comfortable in your own home. Alex doesn't contribute to rent, bills and groceries, doesn't clean up after himself, so what exactly is he doing? Who cleans up after him when he eats and is using dishes? He is a grown ass adult and should be capable of the bare minimum.\n\n  \nI bet if you didn't have only 6 years age difference and you weren't in the role of \"step mom\" but we were talking about a cousin, or a friend, the replies here would be different.", "NTA.  It sounds like if he doesn't move out you all might end up homeless, so you need to prioritise your babies over a 20year old adult with a job who can support himself.  But your bf needs to be the one doing the talking to his son, not you.", "Agreed! Sounds similar to my exes situation except, he isn't involved with our 20 year old son.  My ex is 43, new baby mama is 30 with their 2 year old, her own 9 and 13 year old. Our kids are 25 and 20. New girlfriend is now seeing my ex for the alcoholic play boy he is and complains to our daughter (who is her friend) that my ex doesn't respect her. No,it's because you're practically his kid. The respect comes from a partnership. Of course this guy's kid doesn't respect OP. I don't think this guy respects OP or he would have handled the situation with his son. He is so guilt ridden and trapped that he's just hoping OP leaves.", "NTA. He is an adult now and isn't doing the bare minimum asked. How many times can he say \"fuck you\" with his actions? Not cleaning up after himself, refusing to provide paystubs so you could qualify for help, spending all his money on weed and bullshit? Nah, he has to go. I wouldn't even feel bad. You have 2 young children who need to be the main priority here.", "NTA\n\nWhen he couldn't do the small favor of going to the computer for 5 min to get paystubs so y'all could have help, he basically lost all sympathy.\n\nI get being shitty about being relegated to the couch, I get forgetting to pick your underwear in a bathroom that's supposed to be only yours. I get the temptation of buying junk food over useful stuff.\n\nI don't get fucking your family that is housing you that hard.\n\nI also don't get not helping with the baby blood related to you when the mother just had surgery.", "> he told me he has somewhere to go if we lose the apartment.\n\nHe would have been out the door the moment he said this to me. So, OP, he doesn't care if you two end up on the streets with two kids because he has somewhere to go. No matter how he feels about you or his dad, he should consider the two innocent minors. \n\nYou are NTA if you ask him to move out and reapply for aid.

The two of you together has 3 kids in total and now you\u2019ve just filled for government assistance (welfare) but you are mad at the 20 year old. The 20 year old has no children at 20 your husband can\u2019t say the same. He\u2019s working probably at a low paying job he\u2019s he should clean up his mess and not leave the house a disaster. However he is 20 that cleanliness would have been instilled from a young age by proper parenting. My guess your husband never had him clean up after himself.

He's not \"losing in life\" because he's 20 and still needs financial help. Most people do especially considering her turned 18 during the pandemic. You basically cheat coded your way to relatively financial safety by marrying a gross old man with kids your age. \n\nSo you're TA for acting like he's a kid and you're not, or he's somehow failed and you haven't. \n\nYou and hubby are financially struggling yet again then you shouldn't have started family 2.0 when he couldn't even help out his first family. One of his original kids is still a minor. Are yall paying child support since his daughter lives with her mom?", "NTA\nAll these comments having a go at OP for talking about him like a child when he's 'only six years younger than her'.

I\u2019m also on adderall, like actually prescribed by a doctor for actual ADHD, but if I were to somehow get pregnant again tomorrow it\u2019d be the first thing I\u2019d stop. Stimulants are dangerous for unborn babies across the board, whether you\u2019re prescribed or not, and while there is some withdrawal symptoms if you\u2019re used to taking them daily, it\u2019s just being extra tired for a week or so, no puking/shitting/shivering or any of the reasons you can\u2019t just kick subs.

Your problem is that getting zooted for the afternoon off some adderall was more important to you than not putting your baby at risk of birth defects or death. Your problem is that you\u2019re self absorbed as fuck, fronting like you cared about your baby suffering withdrawals from suboxone when you really just wanted to get it from a doctor to make sure you had what you wanted taken care of, because if you gave an actual shit about that baby\u2019s health you would have resisted the urge to do fucking adderall when you were pregnant, and there is no excuse for it because you did NOT *need* it, you just *wanted* to do it.

Like hooooolyyyyyy shiiiitttttt you should definitely be sterilized immediately before you get knocked up again, you absolute waste of a woman. Unfortunately your shit hasn\u2019t been under control long enough for you to not have been drugging your unborn baby with speed, so I\u2019d maybe keep the self righteous bullshit statements to a minimum if I were you.
