And she's earned my trust that she's not a controlling Ass hole, and I need to do everything I can to ensure I keep her trust because I want to spend time with my niece.\n\nI don't think you should necessarily deny Stephen access, but it is definitely in your right to not allow him to babysit as he broke your trust.

Is it worth giving up a free babysitter?", "ESH- of course he shouldn\u2019t  have done it- yes you overreacted.", "Not really the AH. You were absolutely right to be upset at him.

I believe what you did was wrong, but I could have handled this better.\u201d IMO he shouldn\u2019t be allowed to babysit anymore,  but he should still be able to see the kid.

But at the same time I don't think you should prohibit him from babysitting again. \n\nA lot of people saying he assaulted your kid, while on a technicality they're probably right idk if I would categorize it as that. He did a dumb trend with your child, eggs crack easily, but understandable that as a parent you would want to protect your kid. The posting of the video was also a bad decision and I'm glad he obeyed your wishes and took it down.\n\nMy opinion is that you and your husband should sit down with him and have a good talk, with boundaries and such. I certainty wouldn't apologized for your behavior, because any parent would react the same way. Trustworthy babysitters are just hard to come by and if you have a family member that can do it, as long as they follow your boundaries, that would be the option I would take.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Plus broke a egg over his nephew faces due to a social media trend. Who to say he wont do something else for a trend? \n\nIts tide pods all over again", "Op is nta, I can't imagine leaving my kid with someone they'd be rightfully wary of", "If they can\u2019t respect a boundary definitely", "Free babysitting does not outweigh people terrorising your child, please tell me you don\u2019t have kids", "How did op overreact? Bil broke a boundary and now doesn\u2019t get to babysit. He wasnt cut out of his nephew life.", "Eggs take 3-6 lbs of pressure to crack on an optimal flat surface. A fucking 3 year olds head will absolutely take 4-7 lbs of pressure to crack an egg.", "People who upset their children for internet points should all be investigated. Disgusting morons. It would be a very long time before I would allow BIL who *hit a 3 year old in the face* around my child at all again.", "Your sister sucks", "a 7 year old is much different than a 3 year old", "So your sister is an AH, thanks for outing her.", "even so, that's just fucking weird. it's weird and extremely uncomfortable that a fully grown ass adult would take any kind of pleasure or find humor in throwing shit at a kid's face, it's fucking weird. i'm sorry that you're like this and glad your sister's kid seems fine, but frankly, what the hell? you and your sister suck \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Why is posting videos of kids eating so dangerous? I mean, I know that predators can perv on any kind of photo or video of kids and the nudity involved in bathing might titillate their pedophilic desires, but what is it about eating, specifically?", "The \u201cyou can never babysit\u201d thing.  That part is the overreaction.  I know all of Reddit thinks it\u2019s very wise to cut off family at the first infraction, but it\u2019s actually not.", "I 100% agree, maybe I didn\u2019t explain myself well enough and for that I apologize and if I was the dad I would\u2019ve slapped my brother on the spot. The only reason I made that comment is because others in this thread are ready to sentence the brother 25 to life, which in this particular case I would say it\u2019s excessive.\n\nNow would I banned the BIL from seeing the nephew? No, I wouldn\u2019t, but that doesn\u2019t mean things would go back to normal like nothing happen. I would definitely not let him babysit tomorrow anytime soon, I would make him earn the trust again and it would probably take time and once as a parent I would feel it\u2019s safe I would start with maybe babysitting but with one of us around.\n\nJust overall make him understand that what he did was not right and there were consequences. I\u2019m sure the brother will understand and try his best to make it up. \n\nAnd of course if you don\u2019t even see an ounce of remorse then he will never be left alone with my kid again.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m sorry if I didn\u2019t explain myself well enough on the first reply.", "Nope, she just knows her boy. They ended up making a cake. Bet you'll crucify her for letting him lick the spoon next!", "Honestly, my best guess is because of oral? I don\u2019t know exactly, and I don\u2019t want to know. The reason I say that, is because videos of kids eating hot dog or pickles get saved a whole lot. Even a baby trying a lemon for the first time and the faces they make? It\u2019s not about them seeming older or more mature, it\u2019s about the innocence", "He cannot be trusted alone with the child he can never babysit again that\u2019s how it works when you can\u2019t be trusted to not assault a child when you\u2019re alone with them", "Absolutely", "Why on earth would I have a problem with him licking the spoon unless your sister is also hitting him with it?", "As you say, she knows her boy. You don't know OP's son."]}
