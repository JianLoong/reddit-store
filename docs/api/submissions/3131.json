This turkey is the first thing she made that I didn't like, but it was awful. I don't think MIL even basted it, so it was dry, overcooked, and like SFIL said \"tasted like saw dust\"\n\nThanksgiving is supposed to be our holiday with my husband's family. MIL does not like this and wants Christmas. As a result she usually treats us kind of shitty on Thanksgiving to begin with, but last year was a mess.\n\nNote I always offer to help with the cooking or bring a dish, and she always turns me down. so last year we arrived, she did her typical routine of ignoring us, and then she served all the traditional sides, this dry ass turkey, and she sat down with some meatballs that were just for her.\n\nEveryone asked why she was eating meatballs and she said it is her house. Her husband whined because he wanted some, but she said they were leftovers and there wasn't enough for him. She said turkey is stupid anyway.\n\nNo one liked the turkey so SFIL decided to grill some steak. He also made a turkey burger for his mom, but said that he wasn't cooking for anyone else because he isn't our \"slave\", so at this point MIL, SFIL, and his mom have different food, and me, my kids, my husband, SFIL's stepfather, and MIL's parents have this shit turkey.\n\nI felt humiliated and said I was leaving. MIL just rolled her eyes. I got some grief from MIL's parents about how Thanksgiving isn't about the food, but I snapped at them that my kids weren't going to be treated like shit. We left and went to a buffet. It wasn't great and the whole day was a let down. My husband acted like I ruined Thanksgiving because he said there were enough sides and we should have stayed as her sides were better than that shitty buffet.\n\nI set a boundary that I would never spend another Thanksgiving with her. She made us feel like second class citizens and she clearly can't cook turkey. Today everyone is mad at me and accusing me of being petty and ruining my husband's relationship with MIL. MIL is roasting a chicken this year, so I know we wouldn't have to eat dry turkey, but to me it is the principle. I am refusing to go, send my kids, and I told my husband he is free to go but I will be extremely hurt if he leaves his nuclear family to see mommy.\n\nETA- we don't do Christmas with her because her Christmas is very adult centric and boring for my kids where as my parents make a magical day for my kids", "created_utc": 1669300086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3lcef/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_mils_for_thanksgiving/", "score": 859, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why would I want to take my kids to that? And I certainly don\u2019t blame OP for not. As others have stated, Christmas, for those who celebrate it, are especially magical when you\u2019re a kid who still believes in Santa and all that goes with it, and those years are limited. If grandma doesn\u2019t want to at least play some games with the kids and create some of that magic, meanwhile my parents are willing to offer or try to create that magic, then I know whose house I\u2019m going to.

But I would still suck it up and take them every other year, and/or invite both families to join us at our Christmas. There are ways to make the season special outside of the limited time on a single day that you spend at the boring relatives house, and being boring and fun-hating doesn't make them completely without value and undeserving of any consideration. Their Christmas traditions were formed over a long time and are meaningful to them just like anyone else's.\n\nEdit: like... most Christmases AND Thanksgivings growing up we would go to my mom's ex-husband's house for a couple hours, where the people were weird, the food was bad, and the house was visibly dirty. We did it because it made the holiday better for my (already adult) half-brother and it was honestly fine. Holidays aren't just about pure fun even when you're a kid.", "You both sound petty. That's why ESH \n\nYou're unwillingness to compromise. Your guilt trips on your husband.\nHer and SFIL doing the turkey like she did and him cooking what he wanted too.", "Ah yes, there's nothing more unforgivable then...eating some leftover meatballs. That's certainly worse than being a controlling harpy who needs to dictate everything about every holiday.", "Sometimes I'll say \"your mom\" \"your sister\" or \"your daugther\" when I'm annoyed with my family lol. My family started doing it too and we always get weird looks from the extended family\ud83d\ude06", "I've noticed that Hispanic Americans say \"my mom\" or \"my dad\".

It sounds like you are saying that mom is just the person's speaking, and not a shared mother.", "I hear your point.  But I disagree that the comment or mine invalidated you.  In my opinion, the comment was never addressed to  a \"mixed office\" of people. The \"pretty much everyone\" specifically implies and includes OPs family who likes the holiday as much as OP, and secondarily implied toward those more widely who DO like Christmas as much as OP.  Those who don't celebrate this holiday are not in the \"pretty much everyone\" subset in the first place when read in context, so nothing has been assumed about them.  Anyway we can back and forth all night- have good one and enjoy whatever holiday you celebrate!!", "So you bring some entertainment options and put them in a different room for the kids - kids aren't bored, she enjoys the times when the kids are in the same room and being quieter, and everybody wins!", "That\u2019s why I said ESH. meaning everyone is an asshole. The whole situation is pathetic.

I just can't let them lose one", "To be fair I was instinctively thinking OP was being unreasonable and selfish and then I remembered that we always do Christmas at home or go to my parents, never to my in laws for this exact reason. We do host the in-laws at home every other year which is our compromise but that does involve the in-laws being willing to travel.

Does your husband ever want to spend Christmas with his family?  \n\nI grew up with one side of the family I disliked going to Christmas with and one side I loved to, we alternated; now that I'm grown I'm glad we went because some of them aren't around anymore, and it got me to be closer to them.", "She said it wasn't fair to punish her and her guests would be disappointed. Then she implied we aren't good parents and we cater to our kids too much", "YTA because I think it is messed up that you don't let your husband's parents participate in Christmas just because they don't do Christmas the way that you like it being done. You are raising your children to believe that it is okay to cut people out of your lives if they don't do things the same as you, and that is a monotonous future.\n\nYou are NTA for leaving on Thanksgiving and refusing to return to Thanksgiving, however, because eating meatballs when you're serving turkey to everybody else is a bad move.\n\nNot sure how to classify this because the original question doesn't mention the Christmas stuff, and you're not an asshole for the Thanksgiving choices, but it still needs to be acknowledged.", "NTA considering that she planned from the start not to eat the turkey makes this seem intentional. And you have right to be upset, cos it's not about the turkey, it's about adult person treating everybody badly because of some pettiness.\nI would understand the comments about taking turns on holidays, but I wouldn't bring children to that Christmas party either.\nThe MIL needs to grow up and start considering people around her", "I\u2019ve been reading your comments, and I have to ask\u2026 are you a different race than your husband? Are your kids mixed? Because she clearly treats you and the kids with disdain\u2026", "NTA. She screwed up that turkey on purpose because she\u2019s got her fee-fees hurt over Christmas. She didn\u2019t suddenly become stupid about cooking meat. Your husband can go if he wants.", "ESH", "NTA\nShe make tasty food for herself. Yikes", "NTA. I don\u2019t think this was about the Turkey. Your mil treats you guys really weird and manipulative. I think it was good you left and went to a buffet and I hope you never go back there for another holiday dinner ever.", "YTA\n\nSounds like you're looking for reasons to isolate your husband from his family , and make his only REAL family your and the kids and your parents. So if the turkey was terrible, eat the other stuff? Sounds like you were going to find a problem, no matter what. \n\nYou gave her a hard holiday, and kept the fun ones for your family. You sound like a terrible DIL and like you want him to cut ties with his family.", "ESH at least, in no way are you innocent. Seems like you have no problem spending every holiday with your family or never seeing your in laws for thanksgiving. Did they act terrible last year? Yeah. But somehow you forget that a good part of the thanksgiving food is NOT TURKEY. you would\u2019ve been fine. Also, those are your husbands kids too. Get it right.", "I low key feel like you read this, read too far into it and are now making an ESH comment based on whatever you feel like you read here... \n\nIt's not about the turkey, it's about OP's kids, about being treated like less or pettily ignored even when MIL has said she isn't about to compromise, so I don't know... I think this judgement is a lot, honestly. This feels way too harsh.", "Thank you for that. Alternating holidays is not required as long as the families are treated fairly. My in-laws get thanksgiving every year as it is usually my husband's birthday too and we stay at their home for 3-5 days for it. My mom gets Christmas Eve and my dad comes to our house on Christmas afternoon. Our daughter has started going to my in-laws after Christmas for several days while out of school so that we can work. We try to alternate other holidays and of course spend random weekends with both families. If OPs in laws are willing to make accommodations for the kids then OP has every right to do something that will make them comfortable.", "The MIL doesn\u2019t appear to want to do anything to the day enjoyable for the kids on Christmas.  That is clearly stated.", "Yep.  When we were first married hubby used to say oh we don\u2019t pay attention to what she (mom) says, just \nignore her.  But after a bit he started he would tell her to stop. If her hubby isn\u2019t going to seriously intervene then nothing OP says or does will change MIL a actions.  He\u2019s probably so used to her he doesn\u2019t get it.", "Lmao truth turkey is gross \ud83d\ude02", "no", "Like, that's just down right fucking insulting. I wouldn't want to go through that again.", "And her husband was ok with all of this.  Just eat the sides.  Come on man!", "I agree because that is also what I was getting, since OP's NTA because MIL is ANA (ANA: A Narcissistic Asshole).", "It\u2019s a lot of description about the turkey, not a lot of description about how they are treated badly\u2026 the in laws were shitty to be whipping themselves up extra meat and not sharing it but yeah I think it\u2019s shitty she\u2019s emotionally blackmailing her husband out of spending any holiday with his family. If she doesn\u2019t want to go, fine\u2026 but to say HER kids aren\u2019t going and she will be sooooo hurt if her husband sees his family for the one holiday she previously allowed him to that\u2019s shitty, let the husband take the kids to tgives", "I think they're referring to the fact that OP keeps calling the kids \"her\" kids until the husband wants to visit his mom and stepdad, at which point they're his \"nuclear family\". Also the fact that she's making several unilateral decisions that all boil down to separating her husband from his family, like refusing to participate in the one holiday they see his family for and getting upset that he'd want to do so.", "Calling the kids her kids. Not compromising and alternating thanksgiving/Christmas when it seems obvious both families value Christmas more. The mother is seemingly making an effort by switching to chicken and op still refuses. Saying the husband is free to go but she will hold it against him. Not letting him bring his kids.\n\nAnd this is with her version of events. Definitely seems like an esh to me.", "Seriously, expecting children to have a boring/dull Christmas just sounds so mean. My family did a great job at balancing holidays for both adults and children.", "We don\u2019t know that. \u201cMagical\u201d is a really vague term. It likely means \u201cbuys them more presents\u201d which isn\u2019t necessary.", "OP said Christmas is geared toward adults.  I would not go to a Christmas like that with kids.  His family are charmers for sure", "I can't believe so many people are suggesting you should cater to this woman by giving her every other Christmas. It sounds like she only wants you to come for Christmas so she can have a bigger audience in front of which to treat you and your kids like shit.", "We played in other rooms at my grandparents house on Christmas. It wasn\u2019t a big house. And the adults wanted to talk. Why is that so awful? Children don\u2019t need to be the center of attention the entire time.", "I know plenty of good cooks that have no idea how to make a decent turkey. \n\nBut Reddit loves to jump straight to evil intent. I assume if I keep reading I\u2019ll learn that she has multiple personalities and molested OP\u2019s husband, too.", "She's focusing on the turkey because that turkey, the main dish, was specifically made to be awful. The fact MIL made separate food JUST for herself shows that. Even if she never planned to eat the turkey, the fact she showed ZERO remorse for how awful it was, just said \"turkey is stupid anyway\", just speaks of pure malice and spite.\n\nAs for Christmas, take a look at OP's comment history. There are no other kids there, MIL doesn't try to make meal options the kids would enjoy, sends them out of the room if they want to play. When asked whether they spoke to her MIL about how she hosts Christmas, OP replied with this:\n\n> He did talk to her and she said we were ruining Christmas, why should she punish all of her adults guests, and implied we are bad parents.\n\nYeah, as a former child I'm on her side in regards to Christmas. It's alright MIL doesn't want to impact the experience for other guests who don't have kids, but unfair to demand that the children suffer for it.", "Yep. And \u201cmagical\u201d might just mean that his parents don\u2019t spend as much money on the kids. Looking back, Christmas at our grandparents wasn\u2019t kid centered. And that\u2019s okay. Because when we were older it didn\u2019t lose its charm. Adults can and should enjoy it themselves.", "THey don't WANT Christmas with their grandkids, if they kids are left in another room to not be seen or heard.  Probably expecting OP to stay in there too.", "I do the same thing!", "Word, not arguing that it isn't used that, and commonly. Not even arguing that some people really do say it because of something subconscious. \n\nI just don't think it always is, or is necessarily indicating something off.", "I'm not Hispanic, but I'm very glad other people do this and I'm not alone haha", "I don't know, when I talk to my other sister I call her \"your mother\" because it's usually some wild shit.", "No one buys a $40 turkey or whatever turkeys cost these days and purposefully ruins it. That sounds paranoid and crazy af. Sounds like she probably had other stuff going on and it got over done.\n\nThe entire world doesn\u2019t revolve around the children. She has a spouse and her marriage is going to suffer if she doesn\u2019t include her in laws in the holidays, just saying\u2026.

That's how my family did it, the adults all did their thing upstairs and all the kids played downstairs away from everyone.  Kids can be annoying and Christmas is meant for everyone, not just the kids.", "Haha or maybe act like a grown up, sit down and have a conversation what each participant wants from the holidays and make a plan to accommodate everyone.

Sure MIL is an asshole but so is everyone else on the table.", "I can visit MIL and bring entertainment for my kids any day. I can't deal with them spending Christmas playing alone in another room when they really have so few Christmases to be kids. I would never say this to them", "It just seems so sad to me while knowing they could be at my moms in the center of things with other kids to play with. also I want to spend Christmas with them, not in separate rooms", "Haha yes that would be easy for MIL wouldnt\nIt! \n\n\u201cI want to host Christmas. **How do we want to do this?\u201d**\n\nBut no.
