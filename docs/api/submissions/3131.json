This turkey is the first thing she made that I didn't like, but it was awful. I don't think MIL even basted it, so it was dry, overcooked, and like SFIL said \"tasted like saw dust\"\n\nThanksgiving is supposed to be our holiday with my husband's family. MIL does not like this and wants Christmas. As a result she usually treats us kind of shitty on Thanksgiving to begin with, but last year was a mess.\n\nNote I always offer to help with the cooking or bring a dish, and she always turns me down. so last year we arrived, she did her typical routine of ignoring us, and then she served all the traditional sides, this dry ass turkey, and she sat down with some meatballs that were just for her.\n\nEveryone asked why she was eating meatballs and she said it is her house. Her husband whined because he wanted some, but she said they were leftovers and there wasn't enough for him. She said turkey is stupid anyway.\n\nNo one liked the turkey so SFIL decided to grill some steak. He also made a turkey burger for his mom, but said that he wasn't cooking for anyone else because he isn't our \"slave\", so at this point MIL, SFIL, and his mom have different food, and me, my kids, my husband, SFIL's stepfather, and MIL's parents have this shit turkey.\n\nI felt humiliated and said I was leaving. MIL just rolled her eyes. I got some grief from MIL's parents about how Thanksgiving isn't about the food, but I snapped at them that my kids weren't going to be treated like shit. We left and went to a buffet. It wasn't great and the whole day was a let down. My husband acted like I ruined Thanksgiving because he said there were enough sides and we should have stayed as her sides were better than that shitty buffet.\n\nI set a boundary that I would never spend another Thanksgiving with her. She made us feel like second class citizens and she clearly can't cook turkey. Today everyone is mad at me and accusing me of being petty and ruining my husband's relationship with MIL. MIL is roasting a chicken this year, so I know we wouldn't have to eat dry turkey, but to me it is the principle. I am refusing to go, send my kids, and I told my husband he is free to go but I will be extremely hurt if he leaves his nuclear family to see mommy.\n\nETA- we don't do Christmas with her because her Christmas is very adult centric and boring for my kids where as my parents make a magical day for my kids", "created_utc": 1669300086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3lcef/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_mils_for_thanksgiving/", "score": 178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you never talk about making it child friendly you can't expect her to. Did you ever have Christmas there with the kids or has it just always been about you and your family.", "Have you asked if MIL could make it more child friendly?  Or is it more about wanting your husband there", "*who celebrates it. \n\n(Honestly not intended as a personal attack, just reminding everyone who reads this that plenty of people don't celebrate Christmas for reasons ranging from \"Jewish\" to \"trauma\". Please respect that we exist.)", "Christmas is for the kids. \n\nIf one family goes all out for the kids and one family treats them like annoying accessories, I'd only take my kids to the fun family too. \n\nAdult-centric Christmas parties can fit in around the date (Christmas eve, boxing day, etc.), but you really only get ~10 years of Christmas Magic for the kids and hell if I'm losing half of those to Grandma StuffyShirt.", "seems like she has tried to talk to mil about it and mil refuses to budge as it would be \"punishing the adult guests\"\n\ni wouldn't want to go somewhere where i'm seen as a punishment either", "Of course it is, but not on what is supposed to be a magical day for them. They have their whole lives to learn lessons and Christmas should never feel like a punishment/life lesson", "four years ago. He did talk to her and she said we were ruining Christmas, why should she punish all of her adults guests, and implied we are bad parents.", "Above, OP said her husband talked to his mom about making Christmas more enjoyable for the kids and MIL got upset and said OP and son were ruining Christmas and were bad parents.", "yes and she whined about how we were punishing her and implied we aren't good parents because we cater to our kids too much. She has a lot of guests who would not be ok with it being more child friendly.", "Not sure why you are getting downvoted for this. I completely understand why you would want to do Christmas with your family and not your MIL\u2019s if your family makes it so special for your kids. Do you see them at all during the Christmas holiday or just not on the day? If not, I would recommend doing something just with them around Christmas that can be special for them and the kids so they don\u2019t feel left out. \n\nAs far as thanksgiving goes, can you bring the turkey or another dish so your MIL isn\u2019t doing all the work? It is stressful to cook and plan for a holiday so our family always divides and conquers thanksgiving and it works out great. From your other comments it sounds like maybe she might not be receptive of help the day of, understandable sometimes it takes more work to  tell someone what to do when you can just do it yourself, but if you talk to her beforehand and tell her you want to bring some dishes she might be more receptive? In any case, it sounds like you and your MIL need to work some things out because it\u2019s negatively affecting the relationship with your husband and kids.", "Have you asked your children, without putting thoughts and ideas in to their heads? Have you asked your husband?\n\nWhat you want is only a small part of the matter. Stop being selfish.", "Partially agree.  I would like to hear MILs side of things though.  Her comments, in general, make all  about her, and not \u201cthe family\u201d.  Perhaps OP is poor at writing and wrote in an agitated state, but I see lots of \u201cme\u201d, little \u201cus\u201d.", "Controlling petty grandma doesn\u2019t help either. Kids can tell when the adults around them are tense.", "So you said she wants her to host Christmas and you to be there but she also said that you\u2019re ruining Christmas ? Lol. Then she proceed to ruin thanksgiving because she wants you to get together at Christmas ? It makes zero sense. Either you\u2019re not telling everything or yeah she\u2019s crazy.", "Please edit your post and give this information as it changes things a lot, if she is nit willing to accommodate your kids at Xmas then it's understandable why you don't attend", "Finally, someone with logic. She\u2019s not wrong, Christmas is for the kids. MIL treats them like shit on Thanksgiving for not getting her pick of the holidays and thinks that\u2019ll make them want to spend Christmas with her? MIL sounds selfish and bitter, no way in hell I\u2019d want to spend Christmas with her either.", "Definitely agreed there.", "Definitely agree there.", "These are her grandchildren and she has no safe place for them to play in her house and then complains that they don\u2019t want to be there?  Not every place needs to be for kids but kids aren\u2019t dumb, they know when they aren\u2019t wanted.", "but how do you expect to celebrate Christmas without rowdy excited kids?", "I've done my share of taking small children to in laws who do absolutely nothing to make it fun for them, just sitting on the sofa or letting them wander around a small designated area. The kids get so bored and whiny and it's just like really dull torture. So personally I get what OP is saying.", "We've done it in the past"]}
