First, in much of the US the strip of green between the sidewalk and the street is considered an easement. The owner of the property is responsible for maintenance but it's technically public(ish) land. \n\nSecond, and most common, is that in suburban environments a lot of what was being originally built in the 30s and 40s was pushing away from a wall-to-wall urban life where no greenspace was available.(talking only about design here, the racist and classist reasons for early suburbanism and white flight are a whole other deal). Early communities were designed to put properties setback from the road with a public-facing garden for semi-communal use. Over time the communal expectation declined, but the appeal of your street being a parkland view remained. Most cities and HOAs adapted rules to keep that view, often including rules for lawns, replacing any greenery you remove with something equivalent, etc.\n\nBut front of property fencing in cities is super rare, legally. You might get a \"white picket fence\" rule for a 2-3ft decorative fence you can see through (so loose picketing, chainlink, etc) in the northeast, but across most of the country, especially the west and sunbelt, those aren't often around.\n\nYou usually only find houses with 360 fencing in Rural or unincorporated areas and it's rarely looked on positively by society as a whole.
