First, in much of the US the strip of green between the sidewalk and the street is considered an easement. The owner of the property is responsible for maintenance but it's technically public(ish) land. \n\nSecond, and most common, is that in suburban environments a lot of what was being originally built in the 30s and 40s was pushing away from a wall-to-wall urban life where no greenspace was available.(talking only about design here, the racist and classist reasons for early suburbanism and white flight are a whole other deal). Early communities were designed to put properties setback from the road with a public-facing garden for semi-communal use. Over time the communal expectation declined, but the appeal of your street being a parkland view remained. Most cities and HOAs adapted rules to keep that view, often including rules for lawns, replacing any greenery you remove with something equivalent, etc.\n\nBut front of property fencing in cities is super rare, legally. You might get a \"white picket fence\" rule for a 2-3ft decorative fence you can see through (so loose picketing, chainlink, etc) in the northeast, but across most of the country, especially the west and sunbelt, those aren't often around.\n\nYou usually only find houses with 360 fencing in Rural or unincorporated areas and it's rarely looked on positively by society as a whole. Which, personally, I think is a shame. I'd love to hedge in my whole property, as it's mine and not for other people, but that's just not how it works here. Doing so gets you labeled as weird or heavily fined.", "Sometimes it's for local city government (Councils for the not-Americans) easements for utility access (water/sewer/electricity lines)", "This is hilariously wholesome. How long has this been going on, and how old is the kid?", "This is amazing", "Do you know his parents? I'd just want to make sure they are onboard/understand this silliness as well. I personally love it, but not sure how he would articulate it to an adult.", "That's actually so hilarious \ud83d\ude02 what is his reaction when you spray him though? I'm so curious hahaah", "I think they meant more the fact that he's standing outside/walking home after being hosed down he could get sick", "One of the funniest and bizarrely believable posts I\u2019ve seen on this sub. OP, please get a recording of this \ud83d\ude02", "As a teacher... My guess is this kid isn't getting a whole lot of attention at home. It reminds me of our students who act out to get attention. They don't care if it's negative attention, because at least it's attention. Sorry to be a downer. I'm sure the parents are just glad someone else is babysitting him for 20 minutes.", "good grief. the kid apparently enjoys it. parents don't need to sign off on every harmless encounter their kid has.", "depends, sometimes he just stands there not noticing it while we talk, sometimes he uses it to clean something or wet his hair,", "again...how does having water hosed on you make you sick? do you get sick when you get rained on? it doesn't work that way.", "I'm not a parent or a teacher, but this makes me sad. I'm glad this situation has turned out to be a positive-ish one. Thanks for your insight\n\nEdit: thinking about it more - if my dog came in soaked from head to toe, I would have questions", "That was my impression too.", "Idk if my kid came home soaking wet I'd have questions.", "well apparently this kid's parents either aren't home when he gets home, don't have questions, or the kid has already told them what's happening.", "Okay! It was just a thought."]}
