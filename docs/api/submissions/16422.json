I was going to say you were the asshole and get a fence, but I see nothing wrong with what\u2019s going on now. NAH.", "I mean the kid sounds like kind of an AH. But I guess NAH haha.\n\nKid is obviously deprived of attention and is weirdly getting something bizarrely meaningful from this incredibly strange relationship haha. Has he stopped trying to damage your lawn?", "What a wholesome, inter-generational friendship. I genuinely love this. NTA", "NTA. He's stopped stomping on your lawn but is still seeking you out as someone who will genuinely listen to him whilst you cool him off after training. The kid is showing his gratitude and you're feeding that gratitude. It's a sweet relationship and your wife should stop worrying about what everyone else is thinking and see it for what it is.", "NTA- this is such a nice relationship dont listen to your wife keep it going.", "NTA I think that kid is probably lonely and enjoys your friendship. You could invite him to play another game on the lawn with you (frisbee or whatever)", "NAH\n\nStill a better love story than Twilight", "NTA. It was a brilliant plan in the beginning and has turned into the start of a beautiful friendship.", "NTA it seems like everyone is fine and no harm is being done", "NTA, but I'd be cautious because you don't know the parents yet. Kid's parents could be problematic people. What if they find out and have a very different view or even twist your actions into something creepy that you didn't intend at all? \"This strange man entices our innocent little  child over, hoses him down until his clothes cling, and then tries to chat him up\" etc.", "I think that the kid won the war\n\nETA and everyone knows it", "NTA. This is one of those conflicts that becomes a great story for both of you.  Enjoy!", "Okay but if you could get him to run around, you\u2019d be getting a lawn service people pay for (aeration), js!", "I mean, it\u2019s not really solving the problem with your lawn if he\u2019s standing there digging his cleats around while you\u2019re doing it. Otherwise it\u2019s just odd but relatively harmless.", "NAH. I do think the way you handled this was weird but ig if he doesn't mind and you have grown to accept his lawn-stepping ways it's fine", "NTA and don't stop, it's funny! That you set up your lawn chair makes it even funnier, I love it!!", "At the last place I rented we had a huge issue with stray/free roaming cats, in particular this huge ginger tom. \n\nHe used to sit on the footpath at all hours and howl, setting off every nearby cat and dog. \n\nI started spraying him with the garden hose to make him leave, but the damn thing seemed to like it. I swear he even started coming by more often just to get a hosing. \n\n*OP - are you sure this is a kid, and not a large ginger cat??*", "Get another chair, ask the kid to come sit with you.  That kid rather gets hosed down by a stranger than go home, something's up.", "NTA. But you might consider trying to switch to offering him a cold drink(gatorade or soda) and a chair if you want to deepen the friendship and chat. It sounds like he enjoys the attention and isn't in any rush. Either way NTA your current relationship seems like it's fun for both of you", "That's a dwarf with a piss fetish, mate", "To be honest man, the kids kinda right on this one. When you look at the situation without all the property bs, it\u2019s a dick move. Think about it: he\u2019s a human walking on grass. That\u2019s it. Imagine taking the religious dogma of property value out of the equation and trying to explain this to an alien. You\u2019re a grown man angrily pursuing a kid for walking.", "Wtf it seems messed up. Why you so precious about your lawn? If you want to be friendly then do so without spraying him", "Get the motion sensor sprinkler, and let it rip.  I bet kiddo gets wet ONE time and you have no other problems with anyone walking in your garden.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
