She is bullying you and you have made arrangements to be out of the house when she comes over to avoid the bullying. Good for you. \n\nYou do not have to \"suck it up\" or \"manage her\" (WTF by the way). \n\nYour parents suck. They are enabling her bullying and treating you like crap.", "NTA\n\nYou have no responsibility towards this person. Removing yourself from the situation is healthy.", "NTA - i had a somewhat similar situation when I was younger and i was very jealous of how my dad treated his girlfriend\u2019s children over me. You\u2019re totally entitled to feel the way you do, and ignore her as much as you like.", "No NTA. Your job is not and never will be to manage another adult! If your mother and father don't behave they may find themselves without a kid who wants to help them in their old age at the rate they're going.", "NTA. Your mom is treating you badly and I would definitely keep a lot of distance going forward. \n\nSpend time around people who lift you up and treat you well. For a lot of us, this is not the family we're born into, but the family we make for ourselves.", "Y-T-A for everything else except avoiding her because you do not want to be around her.  This is a completely normal comment and true: \u201cbut it must be easy to get a job if you have one\u201d.  So she went with your brother to the grocery store once.  He is allowed to go do things with other people.  Don't be so possessive of human beings.  It is not a good look.  Your mom is making inappropriate comments to you because you are her kid, i.e. \" I\u2019d put \u201cdisgusting images of myself in other men\u2019s heads\u201d.\"  Your mom is treating her like a guest, not one of her kids.  That is completely normal.  Showing up early to help is also normal and usually appreciated by the host or at least every time I ask.  It is not your job to manage her.  Your parents are the ones that invited her over, so it is their job to entertain her.", "YTA for disliking her just for being lonely.  It doesn't sound like she has done anything purposely mean to you.\n\nThat said, you can avoid her if you want to. Her presence seems to bring up jealousy issues for you. That's because of your insecurities, not her wrongdoing, so stop blaming her, but you don't have to want to spend more time around her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your mother needs to respect that! You respect her choice of friends...", "Hard NTA. Sometimes a sibling is a golden child, but in some rare weird cases this is a far relative or even a kid of a friend. You did nothing wrong at all, besides of you acted not hard enough. But i see where you are coming from, internalized neglection make you doubt yourself. So please repeat after me:\n\n- this girl IS still a bully. Never stopped, only changed her tactics.\n\n- your mum is at least an enabler. I guess, she was the one who made you forgive her. \n\n- you owe this girl NOTHING. Not your forgiveness, not your presence. It is fully legit for you to avoid her, for whatever reason. \"Because i dont like her\" is reason enough.\n\n- till the girl is in town, it wont get better. Start to make preparations for things slowly but continuously escalating. She already has her foot in the door of your parents.\n\n- not sure about rest of family (dad, bro), try to reach out to them separatly. But mom seems to be a hopeless case.", "NTA\n\nSo your parents invite her, know she's difficult and expect you to \"manage her\".  I would nope out, too.  I'm sure you can find lots of interesting things to do on the days she's there.", "The only way to \"manage\" a bully is to hit back harder without remorse.\n\nI doubt OP's parents will back OP if she did tho."]}
