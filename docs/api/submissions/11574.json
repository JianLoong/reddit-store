Food gets sent back in restaurants because it\u2019s not \u201cdone right\u201d for her.

I'm in my mid-50s now, and still picky, and have no intention of changing.\n\nBut.\n\nThis is *my* problem, not anybody else's.  If I'm at a meal and there's nothing I can eat... I don't eat.  If someone makes something special for me, I *appreciate* it, but outside of events that are \"for me\" (eg. birthdays), I don't expect it.\n\n(How did I terrify my parents?  Well.  I was little, maybe... seven or eight?  I was served steak.  I have never liked steak.  I was perfectly content to go to bed hungry.  I was told I couldn't leave the table until I ate some.  I put a forkful into my mouth and went to bed.  My mom went to get me up the next morning... and I then spit it out in front of her.  She became terrified that in my stubbornness I'd choke in my sleep.  That's what it took for them to back off.

If she were just a picky eater politely eating the foods she can tolerate, I'd say you should butt out -- it's not your job to be concerned about her nutrition, her parents and her doctor are handling that. \n\nBut she's old enough to understand that she shouldn't comment on other people's food, shouldn't grab food off people's plates(!), and gets one chance to order in a restaurant (or request a meal be cooked for her) and then has to either eat what's put in front of her or wait and make herself a sandwich at home.

I can actually understand a kid being picky and it can be a big saga getting them to eat a lot of different foods. However, the parents should bring this girl meals from home or where ever they can buy food just the way she likes it when it comes to family gatherings. The parents need to inquire about what restaurant the family will be visiting prior to the day of the gathering so they can decide if it's worth it or not even going to the event after they go online and look at the restaurants website to review the menu. If the restaurant doesn't have a website, they need to call and ask about the menu. The whole family shouldn't be catering to this kid like that since she is not suffering any known medical conditions surrounding food. If this was some type of allergy, I'd cut the kid some slack, but this just seems like the parents gave into bad behavior of a toddler and they never regained control.", "NTA.

They obviously see zero problems with her behavior and will likely be offended or dismissive if you address it with them, no matter how politely.", "NTA.\n\nThis went from understandable to impossible very quickly. It'd be understandable if it was a weird restricted diet in the first place, like you point out with your husband. It'd be unreasonable if you had to keep taking her food back because she kept changing her mind, but with the right restaurant, maybe you could pull it off.\n\nBut her impossible table manners are the actual problem.

They're spoiling  her by letting her rule the roost when it comes to meals.  \n\nEven though I really see this as a parent problem, I don't believe that you should have to put up with her rude behavior.   \n\nBanning the child should send a message to the parents that their kid's behavior is unacceptable .", "Soft YTA. \n\nLook, children can be maddening, I get that. It sounds like her parents are doing her a very serious disservice here because at some point very soon she is going to realize that the whole world isn\u2019t going to cater to her whims and people aren\u2019t going to want to be around her if she\u2019s rude and demanding. \n\nHowever, you have given your opinion and the parents have no desire to listen. At this point, perhaps it would be best to arrange spending time with them outside of regular mealtimes. You have every right to not cook for her, or eat out with her family, or accommodate her at all\u2014 but be wary of hurting your relationship with your family members by trying to force the issue. You may believe that your opinion is objectively true and correct, but at the end of the day, you can be right, or you can be happy. A lot of kids eventually grow out of their picky eating, so there\u2019s hope that someday she won\u2019t be miserable to eat with. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA. It sounds like your actual issue is the child\u2019s behavior, not eating.  If she only took her share of the rolls at a restaurant, ordered her food, left everyone else\u2019s alone (including avoiding obnoxious comments), quietly and politely sent stuff back for fixing, when it\u2019s real (like medium when she asked for well done) that would be fine.   At relatives\u2019, if it\u2019s steak, cut her piece off the rest, and leave it to be cooked longer, when everyone else\u2019s is done, and she left off the comments while everyone else is eating delicious, rare steak while she is eating dry, over cooked steak. (Yeah, we shouldn\u2019t make obnoxious comments like that!). That is an easy accommodation.  Take out her serving of mashed potatoes out before putting the rest into the casserole with cheese to get broiled (assuming she likes her plain, for example).  Stuff like that, easy.   Always assuming she is POLITE AT THE TABLE. And thanks you for doing the extra step.  Changing her mind mid meal at a restaurant is obnoxious, and not ok.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to eat with her, either.  She isn\u2019t using the basic manners that my kids were expected to use at preschool snack time.", "YTA\n\nLet\u2019s be clear that the kid is being raised to have disordered eating.  However that isn\u2019t really the issue at question here.\n\nThe issue at question is should you spend time with these people to make your husbands relationship with his family easier.  The answer is yes.\n\nYou should be willing to make this small sacrifice when spending time with his family and not force his husband to have the ackward conversation about why his wife politely told them they were awful parents that she would no longer spend time with.\n\nPart of a marriage is putting up the annoying but not harmful behaviours of the spouses family members", "YTA because you're focusing on a child who has learned this behavior. \n\nNTA is your title was \"refusing to participate.... my bad parenting in laws\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Pizza, forget it. Hamburger, just meat and bun. Asian food does not go well. You get the gist.\n\nI am currently working with a nutritionist specialized in eating disorders. I wouldn't have gone 20 or 30 years ago, I would have been told what to eat and then not be able to follow through. Nutritionists were generally ill equipped to deal with this issue.\n\nTwo psychologists believe that I must have eaten something really disgusting once and then generalized to other food. I'd really like to know what that was, but I was too young and have no recollection of it. I do remember clearly eating food I have never been close to be able to eat since I developed the issue.\n\nNow I can speak about it because it has a name and I know I am not alone, so a lot of the shame has gone away. It was terrible to be called a picky eater, because it was definitely not a choice and I would have given a lot to be like everyone else. Even today. But, I was desperately trying to go unnoticed and was just hoping no one would notice my almost uneaten plate and just claimed I wasn't hungry (which was easier at 6 than at 16...).\n\nI recall my godmother would always make shrimps as starters because she knew I like it, so there was always a part of the meal I could eat. My family or me never asked, and I never even specifically said anything, I just noticed after a few years that all her starters were shrimps and caught on to what she was doing.

Try allergen.\n\nReally terrible practice and bad karma to lie about an allergen. Stop encouraging people to do it and don\u2019t defend it further", "Yikes. That sounds like a scene from \u201cthe miracle worker\u201d.", "I\u2019ve been in service and we don\u2019t care. Especially if it\u2019s a family table. High end you can say kids are difficult and pay a high \u201cplatting\u201d fee but low end places don\u2019t have the time or energy and they are used to arguing with folks who bring food without offering to pay a \u201cplatting\u201d fee. Just stop. It\u2019s a way to make everyone happy and cover everyone\u2019s ass. I said call in advance. No one is inconvenienced. And again doesn\u2019t harm actual allergy folks.", "She had *scurvy*? Holy cow, that\u2019s pretty hard to achieve (unless you\u2019re extremely impoverished) in a western country. That kid definitely needs intervention.", "Hey, So I know you said they checked her for everything, but ARFID, isnt well known and is a possible reason for that extreme type of picky eating. \n\nI would stress that they look into ARFID. For kids, it can lead to issues like scurvy, but its only been acknowledged by the dsm 5 for ten years, and there are so so many doctors that still dont know about it!", "Yes you are absolutely right. As understanding as I am, it would really get on my nerves as well.\n\nI used to eat only raw vegetables. While by all accounts a good cook, my mother used to really, really boil vegetables and I just couldn't. Broccoli or cauliflower, I wouldn't eat at all, now love them!\n\nThank you. It's a work in progress. It causes other issues. As I said earlier, eating is very social, so this is an issue that can make dating and friendships more complicated.\n\nI used to be really skinny. I have a slight frame, yet I'm overweight from years of being in the mindset of \"I need to grab food now in case I don't like anything later\" even though I'm in charge now - it's like my brain still doesn't understand it. My meals are not perfect but okay, it's the in between which are a disaster, thus I'm now overweight. I really don't want to become diabetic.\n\nI love sports and do plenty of it, but because my food intake is still messy, I crash afterwards and it takes me like 20 hours to fully recover.  People 20 years older are more energetic! But I have new tricks every month and hopefully I'll get there, little by little. :)", "I mean...if you're a 16th century pirate scurvy is easy to achieve. A kid in a modern, first world country it's absolutely horrifying that her parents let this get to that stage.", "Thank you. Another poster mentioned AFTID and I\u2019m going to look it up to get some more information and see if I can find a way to mention it. I really appreciate you raising it as well because any insight into what might be going on is useful.", "I imagine you have to retrain your brain, and from years of doing things one way. That stuff takes time and an enormous amount of effort. Please don\u2019t be too hard on yourself about things. If you\u2019re making progress, even if it\u2019s five steps forward and four steps back, you\u2019re doing well."]}
