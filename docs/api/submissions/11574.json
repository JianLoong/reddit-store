Food gets sent back in restaurants because it\u2019s not \u201cdone right\u201d for her.

I'm in my mid-50s now, and still picky, and have no intention of changing.\n\nBut.\n\nThis is *my* problem, not anybody else's.  If I'm at a meal and there's nothing I can eat... I don't eat.  If someone makes something special for me, I *appreciate* it, but outside of events that are \"for me\" (eg. birthdays), I don't expect it.\n\n(How did I terrify my parents?  Well.  I was little, maybe... seven or eight?  I was served steak.  I have never liked steak.  I was perfectly content to go to bed hungry.  I was told I couldn't leave the table until I ate some.  I put a forkful into my mouth and went to bed.  My mom went to get me up the next morning... and I then spit it out in front of her.  She became terrified that in my stubbornness I'd choke in my sleep.  That's what it took for them to back off.

If she were just a picky eater politely eating the foods she can tolerate, I'd say you should butt out -- it's not your job to be concerned about her nutrition, her parents and her doctor are handling that. \n\nBut she's old enough to understand that she shouldn't comment on other people's food, shouldn't grab food off people's plates(!), and gets one chance to order in a restaurant (or request a meal be cooked for her) and then has to either eat what's put in front of her or wait and make herself a sandwich at home.

I can actually understand a kid being picky and it can be a big saga getting them to eat a lot of different foods. However, the parents should bring this girl meals from home or where ever they can buy food just the way she likes it when it comes to family gatherings. The parents need to inquire about what restaurant the family will be visiting prior to the day of the gathering so they can decide if it's worth it or not even going to the event after they go online and look at the restaurants website to review the menu. If the restaurant doesn't have a website, they need to call and ask about the menu. The whole family shouldn't be catering to this kid like that since she is not suffering any known medical conditions surrounding food. If this was some type of allergy, I'd cut the kid some slack, but this just seems like the parents gave into bad behavior of a toddler and they never regained control.", "NTA.

They obviously see zero problems with her behavior and will likely be offended or dismissive if you address it with them, no matter how politely.", "NTA.\n\nThis went from understandable to impossible very quickly. It'd be understandable if it was a weird restricted diet in the first place, like you point out with your husband. It'd be unreasonable if you had to keep taking her food back because she kept changing her mind, but with the right restaurant, maybe you could pull it off.\n\nBut her impossible table manners are the actual problem.

They're spoiling  her by letting her rule the roost when it comes to meals.  \n\nEven though I really see this as a parent problem, I don't believe that you should have to put up with her rude behavior.   \n\nBanning the child should send a message to the parents that their kid's behavior is unacceptable .", "Soft YTA. \n\nLook, children can be maddening, I get that. It sounds like her parents are doing her a very serious disservice here because at some point very soon she is going to realize that the whole world isn\u2019t going to cater to her whims and people aren\u2019t going to want to be around her if she\u2019s rude and demanding. \n\nHowever, you have given your opinion and the parents have no desire to listen. At this point, perhaps it would be best to arrange spending time with them outside of regular mealtimes. You have every right to not cook for her, or eat out with her family, or accommodate her at all\u2014 but be wary of hurting your relationship with your family members by trying to force the issue. You may believe that your opinion is objectively true and correct, but at the end of the day, you can be right, or you can be happy. A lot of kids eventually grow out of their picky eating, so there\u2019s hope that someday she won\u2019t be miserable to eat with. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA. It sounds like your actual issue is the child\u2019s behavior, not eating.  If she only took her share of the rolls at a restaurant, ordered her food, left everyone else\u2019s alone (including avoiding obnoxious comments), quietly and politely sent stuff back for fixing, when it\u2019s real (like medium when she asked for well done) that would be fine.   At relatives\u2019, if it\u2019s steak, cut her piece off the rest, and leave it to be cooked longer, when everyone else\u2019s is done, and she left off the comments while everyone else is eating delicious, rare steak while she is eating dry, over cooked steak. (Yeah, we shouldn\u2019t make obnoxious comments like that!). That is an easy accommodation.  Take out her serving of mashed potatoes out before putting the rest into the casserole with cheese to get broiled (assuming she likes her plain, for example).  Stuff like that, easy.   Always assuming she is POLITE AT THE TABLE. And thanks you for doing the extra step.  Changing her mind mid meal at a restaurant is obnoxious, and not ok.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to eat with her, either.  She isn\u2019t using the basic manners that my kids were expected to use at preschool snack time.", "YTA\n\nLet\u2019s be clear that the kid is being raised to have disordered eating.  However that isn\u2019t really the issue at question here.\n\nThe issue at question is should you spend time with these people to make your husbands relationship with his family easier.  The answer is yes.\n\nYou should be willing to make this small sacrifice when spending time with his family and not force his husband to have the ackward conversation about why his wife politely told them they were awful parents that she would no longer spend time with.\n\nPart of a marriage is putting up the annoying but not harmful behaviours of the spouses family members", "YTA because you're focusing on a child who has learned this behavior. \n\nNTA is your title was \"refusing to participate.... my bad parenting in laws\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Pizza, forget it. Hamburger, just meat and bun. Asian food does not go well. You get the gist.\n\nI am currently working with a nutritionist specialized in eating disorders. I wouldn't have gone 20 or 30 years ago, I would have been told what to eat and then not be able to follow through. Nutritionists were generally ill equipped to deal with this issue.\n\nTwo psychologists believe that I must have eaten something really disgusting once and then generalized to other food. I'd really like to know what that was, but I was too young and have no recollection of it. I do remember clearly eating food I have never been close to be able to eat since I developed the issue.\n\nNow I can speak about it because it has a name and I know I am not alone, so a lot of the shame has gone away. It was terrible to be called a picky eater, because it was definitely not a choice and I would have given a lot to be like everyone else. Even today. But, I was desperately trying to go unnoticed and was just hoping no one would notice my almost uneaten plate and just claimed I wasn't hungry (which was easier at 6 than at 16...).\n\nI recall my godmother would always make shrimps as starters because she knew I like it, so there was always a part of the meal I could eat. My family or me never asked, and I never even specifically said anything, I just noticed after a few years that all her starters were shrimps and caught on to what she was doing.

The problem is that she is rude and it ruins the meals!", "Sounds like an eating disorder. Eating disorders can be an expression of OCD. Trying to control people and situations through food is pretty common in young children with an eating disorder. A subset of overweight children have it. In OCD associated disorders, emotional control is maintained through repetitive or avoidance behaviors. They seem like nonsense to us but are performing some function. The child can't communicate what that function is because they are too emotionally and socially immature to understand. There is no test for it. However, as the child ages, it will get progressively worse and can be deadly. The family is in denial if they think they can just brush off this obviously alarming situation. As you said, the child's health is suffering already. Puberty is a major trigger. Wanting to isolate at meal time and turning meal time into chaos is an early indicator. Childhood eating disorders are extremely rare. Most doctors have not seen them, or they go undetected until their teenage years when the child becomes more extreme. Therapy for it is generally unsuccessful, and the outlook for earl onset eating disorders is very bad. It is a life of sickness and emotional pain. Sometimes, these kids die young from the lack of nutrition over several years. I dont blame you for not wanting to deal with it. It really doesn't matter if it is an eating disorder or not. Her inability to be polite and make meal time a pleasant experience for all is your problem and you have a right to deal with that however you want. I think on some level you know how completely awful and how serious unwell she is and it hurts you to see that. And you don't approve of how her parents are indulging it so you want to set a boundary. I don't think you are so cold hearted that you see a child struggling with a basic part of life and just don't want your dinner interrupted. That is how you expressed it. But you also used some language that leads me to think you are in denial about your feelings on the subject. (For example, despite it being something you dismiss, you listed it first, so you know in your heart that it is an important mental health issue.) On some level, I think you are very disturbed and upset by what you are seeing. Between being powerless and watching her parents indulge the problematic behavior, the cognitive dissonance that causes you is  overwhelming. So no, I dont believe you are an asshole.

But disorders have to be diagnosed and she\u2019s seen a huge amount of professionals about various issues all of whom have said there is nothing going on that would explain this, and who have ruled out a lot of things (eg they ruled out ASD). I can\u2019t diagnose her myself and I\u2019m not willing to substitute anything I think for what medical professionals have said. I\u2019m certainly willing to take on board anything anyone suggests (such as people have suggested AFRID) and try to put it forward. \n\nYou are absolutely right that it bothers me.

Having said that obviously the two are wrapped up together.\n\nThe boundary setting is, however, separate to this, and it is because the situation has become too disruptive for me. I have missed events and appointments because we are wrapped up dealing with her food.

My parents won\u2019t visit when they are visiting because they find it too distressing and stressful. None of my friends with children will come around when they\u2019re at our place because they don\u2019t want their children learning bad habits. Most of my child free friends find it intolerable.

She needs psychological help!", "Yes, especially the pizza when all kids had Mac Donald ( what she usually wants). She uses food for power play.", "The AH is the one who creates misery and embarrassment, not the one putting up a boundary to not put up with it.", "NTA", "NTA I as a kid had few dislikes to specific foods like beets or how some of the food was prepared but I ate 95% of things.\n\nI would be set straight instantly if I had this much of a attitude", "Your SIL and BIL have done their daughter a horrible disservice. She is not going to be able to function in the real world. What\u2019s going to happen when she goes off to uni and tries to take somebody\u2019s bread off of their plate or when she gets her first summer job during uni and discovers that she cannot afford to order more than one meal at restaurant? She doesn\u2019t just sound like a picky eater; she sounds horridly spoilt and entitled and that is the fault of her enabling parents. You are NTA. I would not cater to any of that sort of nonsense, either.", "NTA", "NTA. I have been around this and it sets me off. You must be raging She is picky about food & rude, and similarly you are picky about people being picky about food and rude. You shouldn\u2019t eat together and everyone should understand it.\n\nThey won\u2019t, but logically if they understand one behaviour, they should accept the other.\n\nI won\u2019t go to meals with grown ass people because they always find fault, pull faces say \u201cuuurgh yuck\u201d, make vomiting sounds etc. It\u2019s the same sort of thing.", ">This is yuck! I want McDonalds\u201d or \u201cI want lamb\u201d and then I\u2019m expected to acquire McDonalds or abandon the meal to cook lamb. \n\nWhy is it YOUR job to do this? I somewhat understand nor BIL and SIL not cooking in your home, but can't your husband do it if he wants to accommodate it? And I really can't understand why you'd be expected to leave and go buy McDonalds. Why aren't her parents doing that if they feel it needs to happen?\n\nI understand not wanting to eat with them at all, but if you do enjoy spending time with BIL and SIL (and maybe even niece) I'd make the following compromise with your husband: you keep having family meals but you no longer cater to her or allow her to take things from you or be rude to you. And he needs to promise to back you up in the way you agreed upon in advance.\n\n1. If you are hosting: You tell BIL, SIL, and niece IN ADVANCE that there will be no changes made to what you are providing her with. If she dosen't like what you made her, that's fine, she does not have to eat it, but you won't be making anything else. (Husband could do it himself if he wanted, but frankly it'd be better if neither of you did.) If niece complains just talk to her kindly like you would a 3 year old who is learning and dosen't like things. \"I worked hard to make this for you and when you say it's yuck it hurts my feelings. I already worked hard and wasting food makes me sad so I'm not making anything else. We have bread and butter if you choose not to eat the beef I made you.\" Then if she keeps whining/complaining you and husband BOTH ignore it. Stay calm, act like it's not a big deal, don't get sucked in. Look away, start talking to each other about something else, etc. If she really tries to get your attention just tell her \"Sweetie, we already told you we weren't making anything else. We aren't going to talk about it anymore since we won't be changing our minds.\"\n2. She DOES NOT get to take things of your plate or your husbands. (Parents can do whatever they want.) If she takes something off your plate stop her if you can, and if you can't grab it right back. Yank it right back out of her hands if needed. Very firmly say \"STOP. It's extremely rude to steal from other people's plates.\" And maybe \"Would you do this at school? Twelve year olds know better then to steal.\"\n3. If the table is given something like bread get ahead of it and take the basket directly from the waiter/as soon as it arrives on the table. Or ask the waiter to please hand you the basket when they arrive with it. Then tell the table \"oh look the bread is here, who wants some? I'm going to split it up to make sure eveyone who wants some gets some\" or something like that. That said, if it's one of the only things the girl can eat (in her current mental health state you can't fix unless you eat together A LOT) I'd also be kind and give her a bigger share. So you can say something like \"Amy, I know bread is one of the only things you like here so I'm going to be nice and let you have the most, so you aren't hungry, but we need to figure out how to split it up before you take it so everyone who wants some does get some.\" Also, considering just asking for more bread? You can suggest she order her own bread basket, for example. \n4. When she makes rude comments about other people's food, you and husband politely correct her. One approach is to say \"It's not nice to insult other people's food, it can make them feel bad or be mad at you. I want to let you know beacuse I don't want other kids to dislike you.\" If she says other kids don't dislike her, ask if she does this at school? If she says no, then say good I'm glad you know how to be polite please do the same here. If she says yes, say maybe other kids are too polite to tell her she's making herself look bad.\n5. If you are a restaurant be sure to get separate checks. If she wants to go somewhere else etc, you and husband both stay where you are. Set this expectation when you show up. \"So, we're having dinner here. If you change your mind and go somewhere else we'll be disappointed and miss you, but we won't be coming with. We hope you choose to stay with us.\"\n6. Is there anything fun or nice about these dinners for niece? She's the only kid and she honestly does not seem to like food much and certainly not eating out and trying new things. Does she enjoy the adult conversations you have? Or is she just unhappy to be there? Maybe think of some ways for things to be somewhat fun for her so she's not just there bored, annoyed, and wanting her preferred foods. If it's at your home and she makes your meals awful, maybe just offer to let her watch a movie or play a game or something instead? Or at a restaurant, make sure there are things for her to do, or borrow someone's phone, or conversations that include her.", ">If that little girl can't even handle what's on my plate, MY own plate, not even her plate, then she needs a time out,\n\nThe thing is a 12 year old is not a little girl. She's much too old for both this behavior and for time outs.\n\nWhat I wonder is how does this girl act at school or when eating with peers. Does she insult her peers food at school? Steal her peers food? My guess is she dosen't, which would mean she can control herself. But if she does . . . that would be very bad for her social life. Does she have serious behavioral/social issues at school? Is she doing okay socially?\n\n12 year olds are old enough that they are often more influenced by their peers then by their parents. Also, unless she's very isolated and home schooled, she should have plenty of experiences eating meals away from Mom and Dad.", "No, actually she is just as bad with her peer group (according to the OP). \n\nShe went to a McDonald's party and had a tantrum about wanting pizza. And then when someone ordered her pizza, she got upset that all the other kids were not going to wait for her to eat their McDonalds. \n\nShe made two other kids cry. Then, she had a melt down. Her parents had to get her. The mother hosting the party was furious. Apparently, the girl no longer gets invited to parties because of this.", "They ARE bad parents, so maybe somebody should tell them?", "Wow, that's very sad. Whether or not she had a developmental disorder or not, at this point she's not behaving like 12 year old should and it's negatively impacting this child's life. (Though, her behavior does remind me of some kids that do have underlying neurological differences and haven't learned how to handle them.) \n\nDoes she know why other kids don't invite her places? Are all of her issues around food, or is this how she treats her peers in general? What about these melt downs? Can she handle other situations where things don't go her way in school/where she dosen't get what she wants? Beacuse that happens all the time.\n\nAre her parents in huge denial? Do they just not know what to do?", "I've worked in food service and every chef I've known hates it when people lie. Depending on the size of the restaurant, they have to quickly deep clean a prep area or the kitchen in general. Cross contamination is no joke if you actually are allergic.\n\nThen you have people who say they're allergic to X, then order food with X in it. Now you have to send the server back to talk to them. If the restaurant wants to cover themselves against possible law suits, then they will refuse to serve that dish to the 'allergic' person. The sheer level of vitriol I've seen servers get over that one...\n\nYes, it does harm actual allergy sufferers. People claim unusual allergies just to make sure there's no X in their food, get found out, and now the staff are sceptical when someone else claims that allergy. Or they get so jaded that any weird allergy is treated as fake. No, it's not professional, but it's a case of people crying wolf. I've had a reactions to food because of it. (Because 'no one's allergic to grapes!' or 'you just don't like the taste/texture'.)\n\nPlease don't cry wolf in restaurants. It means people like me get to suffer when there actually is a wolf.", "I agree completely that she needs psychological help. Because whether there is an underlying issue that has gone un-noticed or whether these are just behavioural issues, she is developing some really problematic tendencies and going to have serious problems in her life."]}
