She was still living at home at the time and didn't know who the dad of her daughter was, so my mom and her decided I would need to babysit every day after school until someone else got home. This went on until I turned 18 and moved out of my mom and stepdad's house and in with my brother who was the same age as my stepsister. My stepsister and I were never sisters, we never called each other family or had a relationship built on anything. So I never regarded her daughter as my niece and I never planned to be an overly involved figure. After I moved out I saw her three times in the past six years. I did not have a strong attachment to her and I certainly never considered her like my own.\n\nBut my mom and stepsister have hyped me up to her. They have told her that all these stories that are simply not true. Stories about me cuddling her to sleep and how I used to call her my little baby, how I adored her more than anyone else in the world. My mom had taken a few photos of me and her that she had staged at the time. They show her those as if they were moments my mom had walked in on. So she has been waiting for this aunt figure who considers her their own child. And when we saw each other three times this year, mostly focused on the fact I was having a baby, she was incredibly jealous and angry.\n\nThe last time was at my grandparents house. My partner and I were focused on our baby, and she was  very emotional and trying to grab my attention. This is when what my mom and stepsister had been telling her came to light. She accused me of replacing her, of my baby stealing her place and trying to push her out. She said I used to do all that stuff with her and now I didn't and it wasn't fair. She asked my stepsister to get me to do that stuff for her again. After some questions it came to light what she was talking about. She wanted me to dedicate myself to her the way she had been told I had. She wanted me to put her before my child. My grandparents told my stepsister to leave and after some arguing she did leave with her daughter. Then they asked my mom what the hell she'd been thinking and what happened from there is my mom called after everyone else had left my grandparents and told me I needed to talk to stepsisters daughter and help them fix the hurt she was going through. I told her it was not my job to fix a problem she and my stepsister created.

The reason I posted this is because the problem is a child is hurt because of lies she was told about me and what I thought of her and she expected a much bigger relationship than the one we have.

First they force to to babysit for three years then they expect you to be super aunt and focus solely on the kid? Do I feel bad for the child? Yes. But the Mom & SS created this fantasy and need to deal with it. They want you to be involved in fixing it so that they don\u2019t have to take the blame for what they did.", "NTA. While she\u2019s right in saying that this is about the child, there\u2019s no reasonable way for you to fix what they caused. Tbh I wonder what exactly they expect you to do. Give up your own baby and adopt her? \n\nIf your (roughly) 9yo niece is that fixated on an aunt she\u2019s hardly seen for most of her life and particularly for most of the life she can remember, something is wrong in her own home. Yes, she needs someone to help her, but that should be a professional. \nYou\u2018ve done nothing wrong. Of course it\u2019s a bit sad you never formed an actual connection but that doesn\u2019t make you an AH. You were a teenager who didn\u2019t choose to become a free babysitter for three years. \nCongrats on your own child!", "NTA. You were the forced caretaker for years, when the child's mother should have been the responsible party. Maybe they made up the story of a loving aunt to make up for them not being the best caretakers after you left. But regardless, they created the hurt the girl feels, not you, and it's their problem to fix.", "Nice to know your grandparents have your back. You are NTA all the way and you are not the free babysitter", "NTA.  That poor child.  Your mom and stepsister are so cruel.", "NTA. And really, any time you engage with her now will reinforce in her mind that she is entitled to your time and effort. It doesn't matter if you sit down with her and tell her she was nothing to you (do not do that obviously), she will only see it as you giving her the attention she thinks she deserves. Also, sitting down and talking with her will lead to your mom and stepsister to ask more of you because now you're \"in her life\".\n\nDo what is necessary for you and your child. Your step-niece is a stranger to you and views your child as a threat/rival/obstacle. You owe her nothing and it's up to you stepsister to parent her. Just be aware that anyone twisted enough to lie to a child this way and attempt to manipulate you with the child is going to lie their way out of it. Who knows what they'll tell her next?", "NTA. They are being manipulative and dishonest. You are right not to encourage or take part in their fantasies.", "NTA", "NTA. The kids at around 9 right?

This kid deserves for someone to tell her the truth.", "Uhmmmmm, you are nta , in your though process, but i feel so bad for the child, it wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if you showed her a small smile, and talked to your mother and stepsister later, again you are nta, but you could have handled it differently", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
