My resentment served and serves no good, but just exists. Luckily, my 3 siblings and I remain in each other's lives and I know they're there for me and I for them. That is a wonderful feeling.", "IDK now that everyone else knows what's going on....", "NTA.  \nYou were forced to babysit with your step-sisters daughter that you aren't too close too.  \nSure it's you opinion to not be close to the baby's life but sometimes it's something that had to be done. It has a life ahead of it.", "NTA. Your mother and step sister messed with that child\u2019s head and it is not your responsibility to fix the years of lies they filled her head with.", "NTA\n\nThey got themselves into this, they can get themselves out.", "What's not compassionate is putting a child in that position. Which is what your mom and that other lady did....NTA", "This is an odd story and I feel like I\u2019m missing something. Why would step sister randomly hype you? What does she have to gain by telling daughter those things?", "Holy yikes. Get far far away from them and never look back, OP. NTA.", "NTA maybe later in life when she's older and better able to cope with things. But rn there's nothing you can do for her or yourself tbh", "NTA. You are right to stay out of it. Maybe ask your grandparents to suggest therapy for the kid, making sure to explain the circumstances to the therapist.", "Any update?", "IDK she's been lied to for years and already has an unhealthy attachment to OP.  The only thing OP can say is \"I'm so sorry none of those stories are true. And i don't know why your mom and gran told you those lies.\" This puts the splaing back on them.", "There was a chick who was on Maury Povich 4 different times for a paternity test, each time she said she was sure that this time so-and-so was the father and none of them were. Don't know if she ever found him.", "They fed her a fairy tale because the reality they have her in sucks and it was the easiest way for them not to have to deal with absolutely anything but the bare minimum of care for this kid.  They told her that once upon a time, someone actually loved and cared for her.  The moment she arrived in this world they were dumping her on someone else.  Once that someone was gone, they probably just treated the girl as a burden.  She's suffering emotional neglect at the very least considering the lie they chose to give her.  So she clung to that lie, it was probably the nicest thing she's had.  She may have even been hoping OP would rescue her, take her away from her shitty life and just love her.  Of course she reacted badly when presented with a reality that deviated from her fairy tale, it likely felt like everything she knew just came crashing down.", "This seems like the best way to go about this I've seen so far.  She may just be 9, but living with those 2 have probably given her enough trauma that she is acutely aware of what a liar is.  I mean, they had to come up with this elaborate lie to get the girl to feel like someone out there actually loved her once at least.  Doesn't say anything good about how they interact with her at all.  I wonder what other shitty things they've done and how many other lies she's already discovered.  Poor kid.", "Are you the mom or the stepsister?", "I do think there's room for, \"Niece's name, I am so sorry but your mom and grandma told you things that were not true. We just were never close the way they told you. You're a wonderful little girl and I'm sorry they lied to you, but I was never a part of this.\"\n\nBUT she'd have to want to talk to the niece and be willing to help fix the problem (that she didn't cause). She absolutely doesn't need to do that. Mom and step-sister are reaping what they sowed. Unfortunately a kid is paying the price for their lies. \n\nNTA", "Some psychos play the long game.", "And why did they even think it was good or necessary?  What possible purpose did it serve?", "This may not be a problem but considering the child\u2019s reaction to your baby replacing, I would be very careful that she is never around your child alone.  Who knows what story your mother and stepsister tell this poor little girl.", "You don\u2019t sound like a compassionate person on that I agree with your mom. However, you don\u2019t have an obligation to be compassionate in this situation and so NTA", "NTA you could instead take the tact of telling the truth.\n\n\"Dear X, yes I did look after you when you were a baby because you mum and grandma made me your babysitter after school, or any time they were too busy.\n\nI have always considered you my niece, and the image your parents have built in your head about over the last 6 years is a lie. I'm sorry that may come as a shock to you, and yes there are photos of us together when you were a baby, because again I was made your baby sitter for 3 years until I moved out of home.\n\nI hope you understand, Aunty Y\"", "The kid deserves honesty. Flat out tell her in plain terms. \n\n\"I was forced to babysit you for 3 yrs and lost a lot of my teen years because of it. I had no choice. That isn't *your* fault though, you were a baby. Your mom and grandma lied, and they shouldn't have.\"\n\nEdited to add NTA", "is it just me or does this just seem off, the step niece is 9 years old and wants to be treated like a baby and is accusing a baby of stealing her place???", "First off, NTA. Wow. \n\nI am so sorry you\u2019re going through this and I am floored that people can be so emotionally manipulative. I am a child psych/foster care provider and reading stories of emotional manipulation makes my blood boil. Emotional abuse is so subtle that it goes unnoticed for so long, but imo one of the most damaging forms of abuse, especially to a child. \n\nOften in blended family if there\u2019s a problem between step siblings, the parent typically takes the side of their bio child (in this case, I would have expected stepdad to have lied to the kid with the stepsister). What baffles me is that it\u2019s your mom who corroborated this with your stepsister. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, what was your dynamic with your mom like before the child was born? What is your stepdad\u2019s stance in all of this? \n\nMy heart aches for this kid. They fed this poor child lies for 6 years about the relationship you guys had. Yes, you were there for the first 3 years but not by choice. Your mom and stepsister made you when this was not your obligation. They decided in your behalf to make you a caregiver as a minor. It makes total sense why you moved out as soon as you turned 18. \n\nThey had to notice how distant you became once you moved out. I imagine with the lack of free childcare they had once you moved, your mom and stepsister were struggling to raise this kid. Was their plan to, for lack of better words, emotionally \u201cbaby trap\u201d you into being an additional caregiver for this kid? Was their mindset \u201cwell if the kid thinks she loves her so much OP would definitely feel guilty and come around more and help babysit\u201d? I am struggling to wrap my head around the logic of this. It\u2019s so nonsensical. \n\nAnd then they had the audacity to ask you to remedy their lies and the hurt they caused to this kid? And then have the audacity to say \u201cthis is about a child\u201d?! This was never about the fucking child. If it was, they wouldn\u2019t have emotionally manipulated and lied to this poor poor kid about a fantasy world that didn\u2019t exist. They wouldn\u2019t have staged photos to make it look like they were in the moment to further brainwash this kid. They severely fucked up that child\u2019s sense of trust in any adult figure. If your mom and stepsister had any compassion like they said you didn\u2019t, they would have never put this child through this suffering. If they had any compassion for the situation, they would take accountability for their mistakes.\n\nNTA NTA NTA. I am so angry for you. I am so sorry.\n\n*edit: couldn\u2019t do math earlier errors are fixed lol*", "While I feel bad for your niece, you did nothing wrong.

I feel for this kid. Her mother and grandmother (really two parent figures) are messing her up in exchange for giving her a nice story to hold onto. What a terrible situation to be in...and she has to be continued to be raised by them...\n\nAt any rate, NTA. Stick to your guns, you did the right thing. Your child comes first, and the fallout of their lies being exposed at the mere fact of your actual existence aren't your problem to fix.", "NTA and good for you for standing your ground.    I can't help but think that the mom and step sister have set all this up because they want to dump the kid on you some more.   They did all this because they want something from you.", "NTA. \n\nYour mom and stepsister sound awful.

But a lot of us can't face having openly strong negative feelings toward our parents so we misdirect it to a sibling, usually an innocent pawn.\n\nAfter my gma died leaving a nasty surprise for my mom, my mom cut off her sister believing her sister was the real culprit. I knew it was a deliberate act by gma, she had told me before dying. I asked my dad what I should. My dad said: \"would you rather think your mother deliberately set out to hurt you on her death bed, or that your sister was responsible?\" Ultimately for reasons I did tell mom, she simply ignored me. She and her sister never spoke again, both dying >30 yrs later.", "It sounds like they didn\u2019t really want to take care of the kid and they were hoping that this gambit would get OP to basically become a full time nanny for the kid so they\u2019d get a break from childcare.", "Dude I think you should go NC or LC with mom and Stepsister and absolutely avoid meeting stepsister\u2019s daughter", "Niece mother and stepsister,  all three  are sick though  the poor  niece's  illness  was caused by  the other two. Go NC with them op.\nNta", "They knew they couldn\u2019t persuade OP normally, but they thought that if the child believed in the fairy tale, the guilt of crushing a child\u2019s heart and making a child realize no one loves them would persuade OP.\n\nAnd it probably helped them control the child whenever they neglected or mistreated her by letting her believe that someone who actually loved her was out there and would come back someday.", "NTA in the slightest! You, quite literally, did nothing wrong. You didn't even know about this fantasy narrative they were spinning. What was their end goal there, anyway? \n\nYou didn't cause the problem, you shouldn't have to fix the problem.", "It\u2019s one of a variety of normal responses to a new sibling and relatively common, yes.", "My thoughts here exactly OP isn\u2019t TA but it\u2019s a messed up situation all the way around. The poor niece for sure needs therapy because it sounds like she is being neglected and the only thing she has to hold on to are lies and she is desperately looking for what all kids crave which is love and someone to care about them. This just makes me sad and pissed at the same time, like if step sis didn\u2019t want her daughter, which is how it sounds, why didn\u2019t she just put her up for adoption", ">The thing is it's just OP's word against theirs that the relationship was a fantasy. \n\nOP's mum, is that you?"]}
