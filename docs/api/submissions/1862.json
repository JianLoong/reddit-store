Very glad to hear they backed you up. NTA", "NTA. They basically made you pay for your step sister getting pregnant without any input from you or consideration for your life. Then when you moved out they blew your attachment to the child out of proportion. Is the kid not getting enough attention at home when she seems so starved for affection? Its no your responsibility to play mummy for her. Her mum needs to step up. Also disturbing that your step sister doesnt know who her childs father is.", "NTA, that being said the right thing to do would still be to make an attempt to help the kid through this. It's not her fault, she's hurt, and trying to process this. You don't owe anybody anything, but usually the \"right thing\" doesn't come with an obligation, it is just what you do because it is right.", "NTA.  They want to be be the asshole to the kid so they don't have to tell her they lied.\n\nDon't budge on this one.", "NTA: tell your selfish mother that you\u2019re not treating the problem that they created. In the meantime, tell her that her stepdaughter needs to track down the dudes said she slept with so this little girl can have a father..", "NTA. You've described this well, Mom and SS created this issue, and they can solve it.  I wonder why they did that?", "Nta. You are being gaslighted into a situation that you didn't know you were in. Sucks for this kid to be fed lies and now devastated because they fed her lies. Block them", "Your mom has fucked is that poor child.", "NTA they did this to themselves. Time to own up and grow up for them.

So her reality would shatter one day? \nThey will hope you'll turn your life around just to cater to that lie for the rest of your life?\n\nHow delusional and entitled of them to think that.\n\nThey should get a lot of backlash for manipulating their own (grand step) Daughter like that.\n\nThose three need therapy", "NTA - the created the problem they can find a way to fix it without your help.\n\nThey used you for free babysitting when you had no choice in the situation.  You left as soon as you were able and had little contact with them.\n\nEnjoy your child but never let that child around yours as you don\u2019t know what she might do to them.", "NTA\n\nAsk you mom, \"Are you ***sure*** you want me to tell niece mommy and nana lied to you!\"?", "Nta, also...run.  this shit sounds toxic AF", "NTA.   \n\n\nYour mom and stepsister are pieces of work for filling that little girls' head with nothing but lies and falsehoods.

They have to work to heal it.\n\nIt is not your job to 'fix' the child they deliberately 'broke'.\n\nThat's abuse.  That's mental abuse.  They have been abusing this poor child for years.   \n\nDoes CPS look into mental abuse cases?   Because this child deserves so much better.  It is going to take years of counseling to undo the evil they did to this poor child.  \n\nAnd they still don't think they did anything wrong.\n\nDON'T USE THIS ANYWHERE", "ESH. Your stepsister and mom for building this up to your niece and you for not looking beyond your hurt and comforting a little girl. It would not have taken much from you to give a child some comfort or kindness. I hope your child never has to experience that level of apathy or passive aggression. AH all around.", "I forget sometimes how much this sub hate children lol. YTA for not thinking about the child, it not her fault or your fault but you are the adult so the lease you can do is talk to the child and essentially tell them that you don\u2019t love them", "Your comment was stolen here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqc7u0/aita_for_telling_my_mom_i_refuse_to_fix_a_problem/ivolvvu/", "To be honest this makes me worry. The attachment the kid has is quite unhealthy. And she is 9. Her step mom and step sister won't fix it. What happens when that child grows old enough to go around alone and still holds a crazy grudge against OPs child?\n\nThis is not OP responsibility at all. And I think is crazy hard for her to fix. I think also this is in OPs best interest that it gets fixed.\n\nI would talk with the family, everyone needs to work on fixing this fantasy. And also send the kid to therapy. A therapist could help her navigate this and come out better from the other end. Is this fair? No. 100% no. Sometimes you have to deal with crap so you don't get showered in it though. If everyone in the family helps the child to understand what the mom and sister said is not true, and they also abused OP, it won't be OPs word against theirs. Also she can take advantage of the fact they said they want the child to feel better. And in this case lying is not the solution, because how can you explain OP loving the child so much and all of the sudden abandoning her? \n\nNTA. I am sorry this happened to you OP it really sucks. And I am also sorry for that poor child, she has been set to fail from the get go :(", "What a weird mythology to force on a kid. It's like making up a Disney story where the \"aunt\" is the fairy godmother.", "I think OP might be a man, and the niece is fatherless.", "A nine year old does not come up with talks like ' you replaced me with the baby' your mother and step sis are feeding vitriol in to that child's head creating fantasy and resentment at the same time", " Let your mom know that they had better tell her the truth and fix this quick because they definitely will not like how you will handle things if this continues.", "I think that\u2019s the threat that OP can hold over her mother\u2019s and sister\u2019s heads if they attempt to manipulate her again.\n\n> I have no idea why you decided to torture your (grand)daughter by creating this false narrative, but it is not my job to clean up your mess. I have already worked out in my head what I will tell to Niece if you force my hand, and it will be the unvarnished truth. That I am not sure why the two of you chose to lie to her, but I babysat her because I was 15 and was told to, and I had no choice. I will tell her that she was my chore, not my \u201cbaby.\u201d I will tell her that I loved her because babies are lovable, but that we had no special bond, and that the reason that I moved out at 18 was to get away from being forced to care for her. Niece needs therapy to try to undo the damage that you have done to her, and I am willing to attend one session with her after discussing it privately with her therapist to figure out the best way to help her untangle this. I hope you understand that you and Sister have probably created lifelong emotional problems for this poor child, and I hope you feel guilty about it.\n\nAnd u/Interesting-Editor41, I hope that you understand that you can never trust your mother or sister alone with your child, and especially not your niece. Your mother and sister, because you have no idea what they would tell your child, since they are obviously willing to psychologically torture children, and your niece because at this age she is probably literally a danger to your child. I\u2019m talking that if you are with them\u2014and I would minimize that time to my greatest ability\u2014that if my partner were not available, I would take my child to the bathroom with me.", "And the niece is about to find out, at 9, that her mother and grandma have been lying to her.
