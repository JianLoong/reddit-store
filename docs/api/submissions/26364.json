{"id": 26364, "submission_id": "16cb3z2", "title": "AITA for making it clear to my stepmom that I don't want her to be present when I give birth?", "selftext": "My stepmom saw a comment I made on a Facebook post several weeks ago that said I would probably have my mom in the delivery room with me if she were still alive. The post was from a page I follow asking expectant parents if they thought their mom's being there would bring them some comfort. She messaged me on Facebook when she saw it and told me I could still have one of my mom's there, her. I replied back that it wasn't her I meant.\n\nI saw her a few days after and she brought up to me how embarrassing it was to have me openly state that on social media where people could see. She said most would assume I have two mom's and that she would be worthy of being invited. I told her my reply was not said to embarrass her but I was being honest about my feelings on the topic. She brought it up more times and tried to advocate for me saying yes. When I kept saying no she said I was blessed with two mom's and sometimes I act as though I only have one.\n\nThe background to this is as follows: I lost my mom when I was 6 and dad remarried just before I turned 8. My stepmom wanted to adopt me when they got married but I didn't want that. My dad didn't want to waste the money if I'd tell a judge I didn't want it and said judge sided with me. I think my stepmom tried to be a good second mom and tried to fill the space my mom used to. She didn't remove mom's memory but she did compete with her memory a lot. I never wanted a second mom and always saw her as more of a dad's wife than a stepmom, but saying stepmom seemed like a compromise to not rock the boat too much. She has four sons with my dad. She's a good mom to them though I think she always wanted a daughter and I do believe that is part of the reason she could never let go of the whole \"mom\" thing.\n\nBut anyway. The topic was not dropped by my stepmom. I changed the subject a lot when she brought it up but over the weekend it came up again and she said I was already honoring my mom and MIL with my daughter's name (not their actual names but associations with them) and I have never acknowledged her as being a mom to me or even a grandma to my daughter and the least I could do is let her be there and let her support me the way I dream my mom would. She told me she could be my greatest advocate and it would go a long way for acknowledging the mother/daughter nature of our relationship.\n\nI made it very clear to her then that I did not want her there and yes, I want my mom, but she never held that title for me. I told her that she was my stepmom and she was not someone I would feel comfortable having there for the moment. She was upset and tried to pull my dad into it but he refused to get involved which... no surprises there. My stepmom said if I didn't want her there then I should have at least deleted those comments and she also said I had made it very clear I think nothing of her feelings.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: The messages were DMs and not public.", "created_utc": 1694078191, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16cb3z2/aita_for_making_it_clear_to_my_stepmom_that_i/", "score": 3012, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your comfort is second only to your health during such a stressful event and you shouldn't feel the need to include anyone you aren't entirely comfortable having with you.", "NTA. I think some people are missing or not understanding what was visible to others on your social media. \n\nYou commented on something a page or group posted, that you\u2019d want your mom at the birth. Your stepmom saw the comment and private MESSAGED you, and you replied to her private MESSAGE. Correct? \n\nYour comment that she and perhaps other saw was that you\u2019d want your mom at the birth. You\u2019re allowed to miss your mom and want her at such a special and vulnerable time. \n\nAlso, your stepmom sounds pushy. No means no. Stop trying to weasel in to the birth.", "NTA\n\nShe's delusional if she thinks that people would read you saying 'I wish my mom could be here with me for this moment' as, 'I am rejecting my stepmom'. No one would. She's not the main character of anyone's story but hers. People would see that reply and feel for you that you lost your mom, not *gasp* 'how can she reject her stepmom that way???'\n\nAnd that is exactly why she'll never get what she wants. She doesn't respect that you had a mom you loved. If she had, you might have had a different relationship. But she didn't, and you don't. Tough for her. She'll never understand why; she's incapable of it. Ignore her BS.", "NTA and once and for all, childbirth is not a spectator sport. I'm sorry your stepmother is offended (and I might have messaged her privately rather than respond on a public Facebook post) but she is ridiculous trying to demand a level of closeness that simply doesn't exist.", "> she also said I had made it very clear I think nothing of her feelings.\n\nShe made it very clear that she thinks nothing of your feelings and that if she wants tobact as your mom, you should have no option but gleefully accept.\n\nLady has to learn that, sometimes, you can want something and not get it, and that sometimes feelings aren't mutual.\n\nIf she didn't want to be answered \"You're not my mom\" publicly on SM, she shouldn't have forced your hand with a public \"AM I not your mom?\" on SM.

She knows how you feel about her and still tried to make you say stuff in public that you don't feel.\n\nNTA", "NTA you were commenting about your mom, SM inserted herself in this, she knew you were not talking about her.", "She has made it very clear she cares so little for your feelings. Having someone in the room with you when delivering your child is a privilege not a right. And in those moments, you are very vulnerable and want the support of those you can depend on, like your husband. She can fuss all she wants, but the facts remain that she is not your mother, her feelings are at the bottom of the barrel, and your life your choice. I wish you and your husband a safe delivery and healthy baby! NTA at all. Your way or the highway she only has those two options.", "NTA\n\nYour child's birth is not about her. It is healthier for you and your baby to have only people who will reduce stress with you in the delivery room.

Just that simple.", "NTA, my wife didn't even want her mother there and they have a very good relationship, my MIL is very nice but she would just stress out and get my wife stressed as well. So it was just me and I'm very happy I got to witness both my children being born.  It's 100% at the discretion of the person giving birth.", "NTA and it is clear that she doesn't care about your feelings, only her feelings in this situation matter. Just be sure to speak to the staff at the hospital about who is allowed where and who is to be kept away from the hospital.

You need someone who will advocate for YOUR needs, not their wants.\n\nHighlighting her actions have demonstrated you made the right decision, and that you have made your decision and there is nothing more to discuss.\n\nIf she brings it up again, then just repeat over and over you have made your decision and there is nothing more to discuss. Then let that sentence hang. Then repeat as needed.", "NTA. I've seen some really nasty comments talking about your grief and feelings towards your stepmother that I think are totally wrong. It doesn't matter if you like or dislike your stepmother. Who you have in the delivery room with you is 100% your choice and not something any parent - step or otherwise - should make about themselves.", "NTA but\u2026\n\ni think your reply to her on facebook was a little hurtful to her as i think initially she genuinely felt that she was \u201cdoing good\u201d by stepping up and trying to be there for you.\n\nOther than that your feelings are justified, if you dont want her there then thats your choice. With the whole \u201ccompeting\u201d with the memories with your mother, i think she is insecure and trying to prove some point, but she needs to understand that not everything is about her and if she was more understanding of that, maybe the relationship wouldnt be so distant between you both. In the end it\u2019s your decision, and she should just stop victimizing herself and drop the subject as it\u2019s clearly going no where\n\nEdit: she\u2019s stated that the facebook conversation was through dm\u2019s, not publicly", "\"I'll be your greatest advocate if you just ignore your own feelings for my comfort!\" NTA", "You weren't \"blessed\" with two moms. This is so gross. She's trying to invade the most vulnerable moment of your life to prove you see her as a mother. I'd start cutting way down on contact. Let her harass her own kids. NTA.", "OP, I just had to chime in to support you because holy shit, some of the comments speaking to your state of healing and your affection towards your family are horrendous.\n\nNo one is EVER entitled to take up the mantle of a treasured relationship in your life if you don't feel that way. It doesn't matter what they gave you, did for you, sacrificed. And they should have done all that knowing that is your autonomy and right. You have a mother. She's gone.\n\nI have stepparents. They're lovely and I value what they bring to my life and I treasure them. But a great step-parent relationship and a parental relationship are different and can both be really good things. Like...separately.\n\n You're not wrong for not being willing to merge the two identities, and it's not a sign of unhealed trauma. It's two very different roles that were never meant to be merged. Some people can make it, that's great but that doesn't make them better or right.\n\nBut. If step-mom HAS to push the envelope, she's going to be really unfortunately reminded that they ARE two separate roles. If she feels rejected and unclaimed, it is because she cannot see the beauty and value in the role she DOES hold in your life and believes she's entitled to one already permanently held by someone else. \n\nAbove all this, mom gets whoever she wants and no one she doesn't in the delivery room!!!!! Regardless of if you literally don't want them there because their shoes are green that day. Seriously. NTA. \ud83d\udc96", "When I had my two kids (60F), it never occurred to me to have my mom in the delivery room, maybe that just wasn't done back then (kids are 30 & 27).  My husband was there.  I can't imagine having someone watch me as I give birth, I don't want my privates being shown to someone other than my husband and docs/nurses.  But if you don't feel close to her, then you are NTA, especially since you tried to tell her nicely quite a few times.  She sounds pushy.", "NTA. \n\nGiving birth is not a spectator sport. It's not about anyone else, but you and your baby. It's about who you're comfortable with seeing you naked. \n\nI will never understand grandparents, sisters, stepparents, etc, who feel that much entitlement to seeing someone else give birth. \n\nWhen I gave birth to my first 17 years ago, I had my husband, my Mom, and my oldest sister in the room. My sister was taking pictures for us, and she has a calm personality and has never overstepped, and even with our age gap (10years) we were always close growing up. My middle sister and I never got along, but when I was pregnant with my second we were at a family gathering and my middle sister made a comment about it being \"her turn\" to be in my delivery room. I told her right then, no. I was not comfortable having her there while I was vulnerable. She rolled her eyes at me, but thankfully, she never brought it up again. \n\nYour dad's wife needs to understand that YOU are giving birth, not her, and that who you have/don't have in there is your choice and your choice alone. \n\nP.S. If something doesn't feel right and you're unsure of it being normal, speak up, I didn't and almost died.", "NTA. A lot of armchair psychologists in these comments, aren't there? Giving birth isn't a spectator sport. Your stepmum needs to back off.", "NTA- She doesn\u2019t get to decide she\u2019s your mother. Y\u2019all don\u2019t have that relationship and she is not entitled to it.", "NTA. It is sad that she wants so badly for you to see her and treat her like a mom, but you cannot force that kind of feelings on someone. You already have a mom, and she should be respectful of that.\n\nBesides, giving birth is first and formost a medical procedure. The only real reason to be there is to support the woman giving birth. It is not a spectator show! No one has the right to be there except the people the person giving birth actually wants present. The only thing that matters is the comfort of mother of the child.", "NTA.\n\nAnd to keep her from showing up, don't tell them until after the baby is born.", "If she wants to be your greatest advocate during your birth - she can start by listening when you say you don\u2019t want her there! The hypocrisy! NTA!!", "NTA- the birth space is not a offering towards any relationship or a gesture to be used for any purpose. The only people in that room should be the people you can\u2019t imagine doing it without.", "If the messages weren\u2019t public, she can hardly gripe about it. NTA. She needs to move on. I think you are right that she always wanted a daughter. NTA.", "Nta shes also made it very clear that she thinks nothing of YOUR feelings and hers are more important. Stick to your guns", "NTA. She is being way too pushy on this. You can not force a relationship with someone if they don\u2019t want that relationship. What she is doing is abusive. Oh and if she didn\u2019t want to hear the truth on social media she shouldn\u2019t have made her statement in that forum.", "NTA.   I get where she\u2019s coming from and she is clearly emotionally invested in this but this is not about her. Giving birth is possibly the biggest experience of your life. You have every right to make that experience the way you want it to be. She\u2019s going to stay upset about it but will get over it eventually. I feel like you are starting your own family and that needs to be your primary focus. Your stepmom doesn\u2019t take precedence.", "NTA. You get to have or not have whomever you want in the delivery room without any justification required. You don\u2019t have to explain it or make them understand.

Honestly I don\u2019t think she was embarrassed I think she was using it as a way to wedge herself into getting her way.  Regardless NTA.", "NTA - Childbirth is not a spectator sport for whoever wants to come watch. You need people there who are going to comfort and support you, not cause you more stress. Having someone you\u2019re not that close with in there is not going to help you at all.", "NTA\n\nBottom line is YOU get to choose who is in that birthing room with you (aside from medical staff).  There's no further need for discussion, justification or explanation.\n\nShe'll have to find a way to get over it.", "NTA. Why do people think birth is a spectator sport? It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s messy and painful and terrifying and if you don\u2019t want someone there while it\u2019s happening, you don\u2019t need someone there. End of story.", "NTA. I only have a son, no daughters or step-daughters or daughters-in-law. But I'm a woman who gave birth to a child. I only had my (then) husband in the delivery room with me (with medical staff, of course). In the late 1980's you were allowed ONE person in the room with you. Somewhere along the line, giving birth has become a spectator event with immediate family, steps, in-laws, neighbors, co-workers, friends, and your regular cashier at the grocery store all thinking they have the \"right\" to WATCH YOU PUSH A PERSON OUT OF YOUR VAGINA!!!!  What in the world has happened? This is when a woman is most exposed and vulnerable and everyone wants to elbow each other out of the way to get the best view right over the OB's shoulders. \n\nGiving birth is a miraculous experience. It is also gross and sweaty and slimy and painful and poopy and bloody and all-around exhausting. If I had to do it again, I would only have my mother in there with me. If my mother was not alive, I would possibly choose a sister if I had one. But no person should think that they \"deserve\" to be there with any woman. Maybe your step-mom could have offered one time to let you know she would be with you if you wanted her there but it doesn't sound like you were extremely close. After you told her \"No, thank you\" one time she should have dropped it.  No woman should badger another to be in the delivery room. \n\nAnd for her DIL's, I cannot imagine having my MIL in there with me. Just NO.", "I don\u2019t mean this in a \u201cChild birth is gross.\u201d sorta way but why does everyone want to or feel like they deserve to be in that room so badly?

Just wait.", "I understand how she may be hurt that you don\u2019t see her in any kind of maternal way since she has been part of your life for so long, and possibly has stepped into that mother role for you at times in your life. \n\nHowever, childbirth is a very intimate and intense experience. Nobody should be in that room unless you want them there. NTA", "If she was your stepmom since you were 8 and you still dont feel comfortable with her or see her as a mother i would strongly assume she did not try hard, or she should take the hint and step back. NTA Dont get bullied into being uncomfortable while giving birth.", "NTA.\n\nYou were young enough that there was a chance of her becoming a maternal figure to you, but it didn't happen.  I wouldn't be surprised if you're absolutely right that she has four sons because she was trying for a girl (your poor \"extra\" brothers).  It sounds like she wanted a girl to go through all those female bonding things with.  She needs to accept that having a Daughter just wasn't in the cards for her.  That's not your void to fill.\n\nThe fact that she's pressuring a pregnant woman is proof in itself that she's unsuitable to be a support person in the delivery room.  She knows you know that she's there and willing.  Time to drop it.  If she doesn't, you might need to tell her she won't see you again until you're settled into Motherhood.  Your job right now is not to tend to her feelings.  It's to have as little stress as possible because it's not good for you or the baby.\n\nAlso, talk to your Dad.  He brought her into your life.  He doesn't get to say he's not getting involved in it.  He needs to shut her down, and if necessary get her therapy about not having a Daughter if she's this level of obsessed.  A bit disturbing that it sounds like the only reason he didn't force the adoption was that there was a risk of wasting money if the judge took your side - not that he cared about your feelings.", "NTA because giving birth is a very private matter and it's totally upto you who you want there.

The person wasn't necessarily bad, their personality just didn't gel with ours.  No one on here would think that is an issue, but rather just part of life.  The same is true for children.  \n\nWhile most of my students like me because I have a fun and creative style, there have been some who just didn't connect with me for some reason or other and that is perfectly okay.  Children have tastes and preferences just like adults do.  A serious child might find me too silly, or a really quiet child might find me too boisterous, and they aren't cold or brats for not appreciating all the hard work I put into my classroom.  \n\nI think it's the same with Stepparents.  Just because the Parent is madly in love with someone, doesn't mean their children are going to like and mesh with this new partner. The child needs to be civil, but it's really unrealistic to think that they are automatically going to view the new partner as a parent figure.  I think it is also unfair to assume that OP does not appreciate or care about her Stepmother just because she doesn't view her as a mom.  People really need to get over the notion that if someone comes into your life at an early enough age you have an obligation to feel a certain way towards them.

The post was from a page I follow asking expectant parents if they thought their mom's being there would bring them some comfort. She messaged me on Facebook when she saw it and told me I could still have one of my mom's there, her. I replied back that it wasn't her I meant.\n\nI saw her a few days after and she brought up to me how embarrassing it was to have me openly state that on social media where people could see. She said most would assume I have two mom's and that she would be worthy of being invited. I told her my reply was not said to embarrass her but I was being honest about my feelings on the topic. She brought it up more times and tried to advocate for me saying yes. When I kept saying no she said I was blessed with two mom's and sometimes I act as though I only have one.\n\nThe background to this is as follows: I lost my mom when I was 6 and dad remarried just before I turned 8. My stepmom wanted to adopt me when they got married but I didn't want that. My dad didn't want to waste the money if I'd tell a judge I didn't want it and said judge sided with me. I think my stepmom tried to be a good second mom and tried to fill the space my mom used to. She didn't remove mom's memory but she did compete with her memory a lot. I never wanted a second mom and always saw her as more of a dad's wife than a stepmom, but saying stepmom seemed like a compromise to not rock the boat too much. She has four sons with my dad. She's a good mom to them though I think she always wanted a daughter and I do believe that is part of the reason she could never let go of the whole \"mom\" thing.\n\nBut anyway. The topic was not dropped by my stepmom. I changed the subject a lot when she brought it up but over the weekend it came up again and she said I was already honoring my mom and MIL with my daughter's name (not their actual names but associations with them) and I have never acknowledged her as being a mom to me or even a grandma to my daughter and the least I could do is let her be there and let her support me the way I dream my mom would. She told me she could be my greatest advocate and it would go a long way for acknowledging the mother/daughter nature of our relationship.\n\nI made it very clear to her then that I did not want her there and yes, I want my mom, but she never held that title for me. I told her that she was my stepmom and she was not someone I would feel comfortable having there for the moment. She was upset and tried to pull my dad into it but he refused to get involved which... no surprises there. My stepmom said if I didn't want her there then I should have at least deleted those comments and she also said I had made it very clear I think nothing of her feelings.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Why are people so dismissive of the stepmoms feelings? It\u2019s not like OP is a child so the stepmoms feelings have to come second. OP is an adult now too, and should be just as conscious of hurting her stepmoms feelings as the other way around.\n\nObviously if she doesn\u2019t think of her stepmom as a mother then that\u2019s fine and she\u2019s under no obligation to have her in the delivery room, BUT she\u2019s aware that her stepmom wishes she were a mother figure and while she doesn\u2019t need to validate that wish, she also doesn\u2019t have to be mean about it. So maybe think before making a public post that could hurt the person who\u2019s done their best to raise you for 10 years.\n\nI mean you don\u2019t HAVE TO try to not hurt the people around you, but imo not trying to at all makes YTA", "NTA for not wanting you step mom in the delivery room.

I think she should get the hint, and stop trying with you. It looks like she has been in your life a long time, and was trying during your earlier years, which is good in the sense of not giving up on a kid. She probably just didn\u2019t do it in a way that worked for you.\n\nUnderstandably, it seems like you carry pain and trauma from losing your Mother, and you never let Step Mom in.

You don\u2019t have to see her as a mom but you should still try to be nice/polite, instead you publicly embarrassed her. I don\u2019t see any malicious intent from her side so I don\u2019t understand your overreaction.

She never took that away from them.", "Nta for not wanting her there for the birth and she should not be so pushy about it.\n\nBut my heart aches for both of you.

I'm not writing this to blame you - this is how life is sometimes - but it would make me very hesitant to be a stepparent. Even when you do your best and are there 24/7 for years and years, there is always a risk that you'll never be enough.", "I\u2019m going to get downvoted but, ESH.\n\nStepmom is an AH because birth is not a spectator sport, period. OP told her no, and that means no.

She tried to compete with the memory of her mom by\u2026let me guess, being a good mom to an 8 year old?)\n\nYes, as a child, OP was processing a lot of big feelings about the death of a parent, so this response is understandable. But now OP is an adult (presumably 20s or 30s?), and about to be a parent. I hope she can have the perspective to look back and realize that stepmom was doing what she could to be a good supportive parental figure to her. No, she doesn\u2019t need to let her into the birth room obviously (that\u2019s a completely different thing).

I told him if something happened to me I'd hope he'd find someone that wanted to be a mother to my daughter. I couldn't handle the thought of her missing out on a lifetime of those mother daughter moments simply because I wasn't there. I didn't want her to spend her whole life feeling a loss she didn't need to feel, or at least feel so strongly. I didn't want her to push people away who just wanted to love her because she felt she owed me some kind of loyalty.

Therefore YOU decide who you do or don\u2019t have in the delivery room.\n\n3. Don\u2019t let her in. She is already stressing you out and the baby is not even born yet. Just imagine what it is going to be like at the birth and after. Pregnancy is supposed to be stress free.\n\n4. I would suggest, if you have no intention of your child(ren) calling her grandma, you address that now.\n\n5. You do only have ONE MOM\u2026 Stepmothers are not substitutions or replacements for actual mothers. Unless, you know, your mother was some heinous individual you want nothing to do with. My biological father had 5 wives including my mom. I was over it after wife number 2. \nSide note: I consider my stepfather my dad since he helped raise me. So there are exceptions.

Tell her no means no, and the pressure and manipulation to shove her way into the delivery room will stop. She can either stop pressuring to replace your mother, or she can\u2019t be around you or the baby. This is the only warning she\u2019s going to get.

Why doesn't he like tennis? I do!\" (that's a bit of an exaggeration, but you know what I mean, I hope). That leads to extending to their children's partners, and it breaks their brains to get the full realisation that, actually, no, that person-in-law is actually their own person, not an NPC in the MIL's life. It's not only MILs of course, but I think it's more prevalent for MILs to be like this, because in some cultures a mother wraps her whole self around motherhood, making it hard to let go.\n\nSo when one DIL allowed something, there must be something wrong with the DIL who didn't, because, \"MILs are obviously always allowed in delivery rooms!\"\n\n(Just my little rant - sorry!)", "She shouldn't.

If you decide that you know better and get me the most expensive machine out there, but I *still* have to put it on the floor and shine a flashlight on the black-on-dark-gray LCD display to see it, I'm gonna be *pissed as hell.* And I will take it back and get what I asked for. \n\nIt does not matter why someone chose to put that specific item on their gift registry.

Does she have the right to have a family holiday without her SD that hates her there?\n\nI know it\u2019s not the same, but I\u2019m just making the point that the SD could try to exclude her from family stuff too.", "They really do! When I had my first child my L&D nurse told my ex if he didn\u2019t stop complaining how long it was taken and how much his back hurt she would personally escort him to the emergency room for the broken bones he was about to have. My mother was behind him with a look is what I was told later. Lol\n\nWith my last child my L&D nurse literally pushed my bf into a chair saying she didn\u2019t have the time or care to move him if he passed out she would just step on him. He\u2019s well over 6ft and had gone a nasty shade of white.", "People who have bad step parent's are unlucky that doesn't make op lucky for not having a person making her life more difficult. Op seemed to try to have a mature convo by saying no 6 times to SM, but she didn't take no for a answer. By bringing the subject over and over again she's just getting more hurt this is not Op fault but the SM herself by not respecting the boundaries of OP.", "did we give birth in the same hospital because SAME!!!! they not so subtly recommend me to file a complaint against him \ud83e\udd23", "At the hospital where I was born, the ***nuns*** told my Dad they would kick him under the table if he fainted and got in their way. He swears the one who said this was wearing Doc Martens under her habit.", "If you're that invested in the specifics of a purchase you should be buying it yourself. Registry options are a suggestion and not your personal shopping list. \n\nExample -husband and I had a few expensive things and we were gifted a lower model from a his mom. We have enough insight into her finances to know that for her it was a VERY generous gift. We still upgraded and when it came up we just said we'd wound up with doubles and were able to get the xyz extra accessory with her gift so bonus!\n\nI agree 100% that yes, in an ideal world they should just snag it because hey, you know what you'd like, thats great but every action in the world is not this massive narcissist scheme to manipulate you to high heaven. \n\nIf this is your attitude I genuinely feel sad for you. It's such a blessing to have people in your life that care enough about you to want to purchase gifts for you and celebrate your milestones. What you wrote takes that so so so for granted it's ridiculous.", "Then give it back to her so she can give it to someone that appreciates and wants it and don't accept a single thing from her moving forward. If she's literally going from person go person sobbing and crying that's unhinged but if I had this unpleasant a dynamic with a family member that even trying to do something nice for them was met with some bullshit I'd struggle too ngl.\n\nIf you accept nothing and you eliminate that part of your relationship it will no longer be toxic because it doesn't exist.", "I think they\u2019re both lashing out. Decades of this kind of relationship can make both sides see things in weird ways.", "I mean, it\u2019s fine. Be an ass to your nice step mom if you want. No skin off my back. Just pointing out. It\u2019s kind of an asshole move. Which was the question. \n\nNot sure why I have to explain my reasoning to you now. I thought I was giving my opinion to the asker. But I guess you know her?", "I see no evidence of lashing out on OP's part. She is a strong young woman with strong boundaries. She is not about to be ambushed into pretending things are what they are not.", "You don't have to explain only if want, that's kinda the point of commenting, no? I just don't understand why you think is an asshole move .So let's just agree to disagree"]}
