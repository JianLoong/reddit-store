If he's *that* stressed about $40 on a cake I highly doubt they're staying in a suite with a full kitchen.\n\nIf they *are* paying for a suite and $40 on a cake breaks the bank...OP is the AH for an entirely different reason.", "What they're asking is whether they're in the resort right now. They might not even have an oven.", "The kid probably will care if they're expecting a professionally-decorated cake and get a can of frosting smeared on with a table knife.", "What he\u2019s spending is a LOT for two days. He must be doing park hopper plus an extra party or something. Their ticket cost is over the top.", "Don\u2019t forget store bought from grocery cakes don\u2019t generally taste that good, homemade is usually better. That said, if it\u2019s the wife\u2019s job to make it while preparing the family for a trip to Disney, that is completely unreasonable, if you\u2019re that broke, don\u2019t go to the most expensive place on earth.", "A surprise? Did she use her own money, or do you have combined finances?", "That\u2019s just for the tickets he said. Doesn\u2019t even include the hotel and food and transport\u2026.", "It's such a deeply buried lede that it makes me suspicious of the whole story.", "That has to include the hotel and maybe a dining plan.  Parking perhaps and maybe airfare?  I was at Disney last year with the family and honestly $40 is pocket change once you\u2019re in the resort.  Just stopping for some snacks will set you back that amount.  That theme park exists to make your wallet lighter.", "We in my house definitely means my wife is baking and decorating...but im cooking the special dinner and drying the dishes while she washes.  Around here we means we.  Im a good cook and shes a great baker/decorator.", "And \"we\" go to work and earn the lions share of income. So yes, I'm sure we would have the wife bake the cake.", "Or buy a berry Crocker cake mix and just slather it in the icing that only needs the back of a knife. Kids happy to add sprinkles and silver balls", "Someone being obligated for 40+ hours outside the home is not irrelevant.", "You could be right, but I also see that if they are not sharing finances and all of it is being left up to him to pay for it, then he might have a better understanding of the budget. She could argue that they would spend the money on themselves throughout the year, but if money is tight now that is irrelevant.", "Ya I saw that after", "OP is dodging questions about finances, part of me has the feeling OP is NOT the breadwinner in the home.", "They\u2019d make the cake before they go??? They\u2019d get the ingredients at Publix, literally a grocery store, same place where they plan on getting the cake. You think OP suggested baking a cake without access to a kitchen? Lmao some of you people have the problem solving skills of a rock.", "Or a sit down.  Something like Royal Table is easily $100+ per person", "Publix cakes are legit great, though. Only store bought cake that I enjoy.", "The frosting tastes like crap", "We have combined finances", "He said just tickets\u2014no hotel.", "He doesnt have a resort sorted yet. He got ripped off bad", "\"We\" haven't actually weighed in on who earns what.", "That\u2019s my method!!", "Someone being obligated for 168hrs a week inside the home isn\u2019t irrelevant either.", "If money is that tight, they shouldn\u2019t be going to Disney at all. Why is it so expensive? Idk USA pricing but it\u2019s wild to me that people would pay $2000 in park tickets. Are they taking 10 people?", "Did you read the comment they were replying to? Because I *did* ask if it as feasible to bring the cake from home, as well. \n\nI've met enough idiots who can't cook that ask stupid questions like this. Lucky you, that you haven't met them.", "Because it's basically sugar and lard.", "> The frosting tastes like crap.\n\nOr it's just way too sweet.", "Then that's not a surprise, it's basically theft.", "how much money is each of your bringing home into your finances? i feel like that is a huge contributing factor here.", "I just figured he hasn\u2019t paid off the credit card he booked the resort under, but either way, Disney just a money vacuum.", "I\u2019m a Florida resident. My fianc\u00e9 is a chef at Epcot so thankfully myself and the kids get in for free. Florida residents have the pixie pass option which is weekdays for like 300 dollars a year with a monthly payment option. For OP, if they\u2019re not a resident of Florida, they\u2019re looking at 400 bucks per two day ticket with the park hopper option. Without park hopping, it\u2019s somewhere around 300.   Any age above 3 pays full adult pricing as well. A trip to Disney these days for a family easily runs in the thousands. The prices are outrageous.", "Also, you\u2019re right. If they need to budget for a $40 cake, they shouldn\u2019t be going at all.", "I can easily see spending $2k on Disney. They keep increasing prices,  but last I checked a 1 day ticket starts at $100 for basic ticket nothing fancy. There are different levels and passes and hopper tickets, so if 3 people go for 3 days on the cheap, that\u2019s already $900-1000 alone. If they got fast passes and park hops and parking, that\u2019s more $$.", "They are very clearly not paying $2k in part tickets. He says they are in a resort. If you don't live near Disney (which is most people) part of the cost of doing there is the travel and accommodation.", "> Did you read the comment they were replying to? Because I did ask if it as feasible to bring the cake from home, as well.\n> \n\n\nYou also made the \"sourcing\" of the ingredients sound like an expedition that even the likes of Lewis and Clark would balk at despite the fact that the wife's plan is to get a premade cake from a literal grocery store.", "Most grocery store bakery frosting tastes more like sugar and Crisco. Longer shelf life, I think, but just tastes like super sweet grease.", "It tastes like whipped sugar to me", "That is insane. I looked at going to EuroDisney and it was like \u00a32000 for the very best hotel for a week and included park tickets.", "And I quote \u2018we have already paid over $2k in park tickets and still haven\u2019t paid for the resort\u2019", "\"sourcing\" is more succinct than \"find the nearest grocery store and drive through Orlando, an absolute hellhole of urban planning or pay rush/high demand pricing on a grocery delivery app.\" [Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-preview.redd.it%2FadgZcHd0-uYUuBnTfntVsGspKx-duqLt9UOqeoUCSAo.gif%3Fformat%3Dmp4%26s%3D0d97a8af45fe7e9f7d78e48f21bf7a796390943b)\n\nPeople who are financially literate enough not to waste thousands of dollars on a birthday weekend for a child usually realize that there is more to \"saving money\" than the raw dollar amount. Convenience and common sense have value.", "Yup. That's why, whenever I ask for a cake (though I prefer to have birthday pie), I specify either homemade buttercream (with very little sugar), cream cheese-based icing, or sour cream icing (that's super tasty and isn't sour at all). If the person making it can recommend something that isn't cloyingly sweet, I'll try that too.", "I\u2019m seriously considering EuroDisney for any future visits even though I\u2019m in the US.  It\u2019s a cheaper alternative than WDW."]}
