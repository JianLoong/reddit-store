I had worked my ass for it. I haven't saved money, cause I never knew it was a concern. \n\nI had to instead go to community college and work part-time to pay it. I had switched to accounting and worked at a small accounting firm. It went big and as I graduated, I got a good paying job there due to prior experience with the company. \n\nNow seeing how my parents had the audacity to ask me money, I was furious.

I get that the parents could have lied (wouldn't put it past people like that TBH) But, unless sis is used to always getting her way and can't take 'No'  for an answer she would have handled it with the maturity of someone over 6 years old.", "NTA but here me out ok...now put yourself into your sisters shoes, your sister hasnt faced much hardships compared to you, you had to mentally prepare yourself for the future by holding your own early on as possible by doing part time job while your sister didnt had any reason to I guess at that time but now she is becoming a more mature person and doesnt know how to handle herself as the parents arent a great support for her aswell so as a brother what you can do is be a guidance to her, I wouldn't want my sister to suffer the same hardships as I did so I will atleast try to give ber advice and knowledge so she can start holding on her own, try to keep yourself updated on her and see if she is hard working and had dedication but if its not enough to help her earn money for her tuition then maybe if you can then help her out until she gets a good grip on herself and gets a decent job, you can ask her to pay you the money back if u spend on her if u want to cuz you have struggled way more than her to earn that money and see if she tries her best to arrange that for you later on but as a brother myself I would atleast want my sisters to have an easier time than me, now it would be different if it was my little brother then I would only guide him to not waste his growth by spoon feeding him unless he needs it alot (this is totally hypothetical as I dont have a job currently and would love to have one so I can support my family but my mum says complete my Uni degree then do whatever I want to, I have passion for video editing but stopped cuz of Uni and cuz I dropped a well paying job offer cuz mom told me to focus on Uni which made my motivation to make videos drop alot but passion is still there but knowing I could had made alot of money an yr ago until now still hurts my soul, thats the negative impact of having your parents pay for your studies, you are in their leashes which you cant blame them for as they have expectations with me and I need to focus on that more than anything but still sucks! Sorry had to vent out abit)", "NTA. Your parents seem like selfish assholes tbh, your kids are your kids for life, thus they are and always will be your responsibility to a certain extent. The end of the day its your choice and they should respect that as you respected their choices when they said no to you.", "NTA. Your parents are greedy, or stingy. Either way, they chose themselves over their children.", "Nta sometimes helping someone especially at a youngish age is really setting them back. You have to be taught at a young age to struggle and persevere otherwise you will always look to others for help even when you get old enough that it is expected to be independent.", "The bigger problem here is that they really think you have the money and the resources. Please nip this thinking in the bud. Tell them you are broke; tell them you are in debt. (Never let them think you have money, or they will think they have money.) Offer help to sister in the form of \u201cadvice.\u201d Sis can go to the community college and take a similar approach to how you made it. \n\nEdited to add: NTA", "NTA. Why the double standard and why trying to shove their responsibility off on you? Your parents are assholes and your sister is as well.", "Tough shit. Tell her that you worked your ass off, she can do the same. NTA. Don't give your parents a cent when they are old.", "NTA. Not your responsibility", "Nope. This shouldn't be a discussion had at the last moment. This should have been an ongoing discussion with both you and your sister from tweens onward about college and who would be financially responsible. Perhaps if you had known, you would have worked hard and banked your money to swing college - or at least start at the community college and transfer to a 4-year school.\n\nTheir poor planning and decisions shouldn't be thrust onto you.\n\nNTA", "Your sister didn't help you with tuition, so she has no right. NTA.", "Nta, it's your money. She should have your parents pay it", "NTA\nPoint sis in the same direction you went at that time. You're not obligated to pay for her as she's not your responsibility. Your parents are just shirking their responsibility with her as they did with you. Don't feel guilty for saying no either. Advise her about all the help she can get and leave that ball in her court. If you give in to her and your parents demands for you to pay, you may end up paying for more than you planned", "NTA.  Not your kid.  She can go to community college and get a job.  Block her until the nonsense blows over.  Tell you parents if they don't let it go that you'll block them too.  You owe them and your sister nothing.  You figured out how to get yourself to college and now your sister has to figure that out now.  Community college is a fine start.  She doesn't need to go to a \"good\" college, most businesses just care about the degree not where it came from.", "Nta", "NTA \n\nTell your parents you don\u2019t want to take on the burden of someone else\u2019s schooling costs much like they didn\u2019t/don\u2019t. \n\nYou would however be happy to explain your path to college to your sister so she can figure out a path of her own. It starts with getting a job and saving up to pay for her own classes.", "NTA.\n\nI guess it's clear who the favourite is...", ">I said tough shit, let her figure it out on her own. \n\nSounds about right. Your parents sound awful.\n\nYou can, however, offer your sister financial advice based on your experience to help her figure out what to do. That will cost you nothing but a little of your time.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Let your parents figure it out.", "The number of posts from young adults whose parents expect them to pay for a sibling's tuition or wedding or living arrangements is astonishing. It would never have even crossed my mind that there are parents who think this way, let alone act on it. \n\nNTA. Helping your sister out in some way would be a lovely gesture, but you are not obligated, nor should you feel you have to take responsibility for it.", "No. They didn't ask for anyone to help you. They should have saved up. You don't owe her anything. She can do what you did. She is no better than you", "NTA", "I wouldn't call them cowards. I would call them consistent.\n\nThey want nothing to do with paying for either of their children's college education.\n\nIt's just with this younger child, they think they've spotted another way to not pay for it...get the brother to pay.", "Learning how to fill in the FAFSA is key!", "I have no idea why this comment was downvoted so much", "Which would likely open a door in which sister and parents will expect that OPs wallet is always open to them. NTA", "NTA.  How does it fall on you to pay for your sister's education?  She can get loans, or your parents can pay.  This isn't your problem, or concern.", "Well, they're not favoring her in this case. They're refusing to pay for her college education just like they refused to pay for yours.\n\nThem thinking that you'll pay for it is still them not paying for it. It's also foolish thinking on their part.", "Wow, I guess I suck at advice. That\u2019s on me.", "I mean presumably the sister is somewhere between 16 and 18.  That is not an age range known for rational thinking or maturity.  She probably thought she had paid access to college as the parents have been lying and then they redirected her anger towards her sister.  \n\nIf OP can have a sit-down conversation with her in which she and younger sis can keep their cool, then it may turn out more reasonably.  Judging her as a 6 year old for having her future plans suddenly pulled out from under her in her mid-late teens isn't really fair.  A lot of adults don't handle such massive undercutting of their future well.", "You mean how the OP had her plans pulled out from under her?\n\nIf anything, the sis should have seen what happened to OP and planned accordingly.  She's at least had some war ing."]}
