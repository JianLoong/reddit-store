I had worked my ass for it. I haven't saved money, cause I never knew it was a concern. \n\nI had to instead go to community college and work part-time to pay it. I had switched to accounting and worked at a small accounting firm. It went big and as I graduated, I got a good paying job there due to prior experience with the company. \n\nNow seeing how my parents had the audacity to ask me money, I was furious.

That they should sign a loan with her.

Yeah they can kick rocks. Your sister can figure it out like you did. **As far as your parents I\u2019d remind them that you have no more responsibility to them or your sister than they ever took on for you.

Now your sister? Give it to her straight. Tell her what you had to do to get where you are and that she\u2019s every bit of capable of doing the same, and just because you\u2019re in a financial position to do so doesn\u2019t mean you should or that it\u2019s owed to her to do so.\n\n**Tell her you love her but it\u2019s not your responsibility to make her life easier, you\u2019re her sister not her mother.** That if anyone owes her help Its your parents.

Tell her the same thing, that if she refuses to check her entitlement that you\u2019ll be forced to cut contact with her until she can. **Remind her (and your parents) that no amount of bullying, harassment, or emotional manipulation will make you give them money; but it will make you cut them out or your life.**\n\n**You don\u2019t have to mean it but you absolutely need to say those words for them to realize that they\u2019re not gonna crack you, just lose you. They need to be scared of that in order for them to realize pushing this hard will only hurt the relationship and not your wallet like planned**. I get your parents might not have been in a position to help you then, or to help her now. That\u2019s not the problem, the problem is \n\n**A)** it was never communicated to you that you were going to have to fend for yourself and needed to make arrangements on your own to do so\n\n**B)** that they\u2019re pushing off what should be if anyones, their financial responsibility onto you.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with not being able to pay you kids college, but it\u2019s absolutely selfish to demand one kid carry the bill for the other because you don\u2019t want to make sacrifices and you don\u2019t want to hear the other complain about how much it sucks. **Even if they do stop harassing you I\u2019d seriously consider what you\u2019re even gaining by having them in you life at this point in time. Family doesn\u2019t mean you have to give until you\u2019re dry, it\u2019s a push and pull. You help them because you KNOW (not suspect) that they\u2019d do the same for you.
