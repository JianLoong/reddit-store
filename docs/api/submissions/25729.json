Recently my parents approached me and asked if I could pay my sister's tution. I said no, that even if I could, I won't. \n\nI have some reasons for the same. When I wanted to go to University and got admission into a good one, my parents said they can't afford the tuition. Though disappointed, I said fine, just cosign some loans with me. They refused again, saying they don't want to take such burden into their age. \n\nThis made me frustrated. We had talked about college before and they had never said we don't have funds for it. I had worked my ass for it. I haven't saved money, cause I never knew it was a concern. \n\nI had to instead go to community college and work part-time to pay it. I had switched to accounting and worked at a small accounting firm. It went big and as I graduated, I got a good paying job there due to prior experience with the company. \n\nNow seeing how my parents had the audacity to ask me money, I was furious. They said I had a responsibility towards my sister. That I have the resources and should help her achieve her dream. \n\nI told them she was their kid and they had the responsibility, not me. That they should sign a loan with her. They said they can't do that, citing same reason of not wanting a loan into their retirement. \n\nI said tough shit, let her figure it out on her own. \n\nNow my sister is blasting my phone calling me AH for not helping her. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693242491, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163rqbm/aita_for_refusing_to_help_pay_my_sisters_tution/", "score": 202, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can try community college if they don't help, it's really not that bad. They act as if you're ruining her life for not paying what I assume is tens of thousands of dollars for her education. Why would you spend that amount of money? They need to take care of their own kid and if they can't, the kid needs to take care of herself, just like you did.", "NTA and your parents have some nerve trying to make your sister's situation your responsibility.

Your reasons are good for not paying the tuition of your sister and your parent are pretty bad for not give you any help for your tuition. I'm not talking about money here, I understand what not everybody have the financial capabilities. But they should have talked to you earlier about this and what they could do to help you outside of money.\n\nThat said, you could give your sister the help your parent refused.

And for all you know, they led her to believe that idea.  You were going to put her through school, because you are sisters, and she means so much to you.\n\nAgain, pure speculation on my part.  You know how close to the truth that is, not Reddit.\n\nStill NTA.  But you may have to consider going NC with the family at least for while, until they get over this.", "NTA.  You're right - your sister is NOT your responsibility.  This is on your parents.  If they don't have the money and won't do a loan then your sister can do the same thing you did - work her way through college.  Just because you make good money now doesn't mean you have to take on the financial responsibility for your sister.  You need to start saving for yourself and your future.
