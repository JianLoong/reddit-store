Also, you need to explain to them that they phrase these vacations as gifts, not something you have to pay for but something you thought they would cover since they knew you didn't really have a job.", "The way they go about these vacations is super weird. Sure, just because they have this newfound money doesn\u2019t mean they have to spend it on anyone else, but they canceled Christmas gifts for a vacation. Then asked if you wanted to go on vacation for your birthday\u2026 im not saying assuming is ever the best, but who wouldn\u2019t at that point. \n\nSometimes newfound money can make people act strangely. Perhaps, your parents want to have these lavish vacations with their kids, but are too possessive of their money to let go of it? Either that or they super suck at conversation. Even worse if they\u2019re doing it on purpose. \n\nRegardless, you\u2019re NTA for not wanting to spend the money. You\u2019re not guilting them for not paying, just being honest that you can\u2019t afford it and the vacations aren\u2019t even your first choice.", "NTA.  You are being smart with your money and not squandering it. Your parents are soft AHs for not being clearer that they are not gifting you travel and expect you to pay.", "NTA. You\u2019re not crazy. I\u2019d be offended too if I kept being \u201cinvited\u201d to \u201cfamily vacations\u201d where I have to pay. The Christmas one was super tricky, and the birthday one was even worse. You\u2019re only 20. Your assumption was correct.", "What the heck is the matter with your parents?  I couldn't imagine asking any of my children to pitch in on a vacation that was my idea.  \n\nHow could they not be supportive of you saving money and building a future at such a young age?

It\u2019s your money, so you\u2019re free to do with it as you please. \n\nYou wouldn\u2019t even be it if you didn\u2019t want to go and they *were* paying. \n\nYou are under no obligations whatsoever to join them on their trips. \n\nNTA.", "Nta they are being ridiculous. You don\u2019t invite close relatives -especially young adult children just starting out- to come when they had no vote in the where when why or how much, and then after they accept, charge them. Save your money!", "NTA. At all. It sounds to me as if your parents want you to partially bankroll the vacations they want to go on. You are not involved in the planning, they don\u2019t take your preferences into consideration, and their vagueness (generous-sounding invitation followed by a bait-and-switch demand for money) is super sketchy. An invitation is not a summons, and I think you should decline if you want to, and spend your money on the vacation you want.", "NTA. You're not expecting them to pay you. You just don't expect yourself to be there when you can save that money for better stuff.", "NTA. You\u2019re an adult now. How you spend your time and money is up to you.

Time to set boundaries and establish your own life as an adult.", "NTA- If someone plans a trip without asking you, then expects you to pay for it, they have no respect for your boundaries. I think you'll need to assume they want you to pay for any trips going forward, and set a firm boundary with them that they should ask you before booking any travel because you don't have the money to spare as you are saving for other travel later in the year.  Tell them you're sad they won't stay home and celebrate with you for the next holiday or whatever they try to turn into a vacation.", "NTA, it sounds like they're literally bait and switching you by being coy with their language.

It's weird for sure, and you're not an AH for wanting to spend your funds on trips that YOU are interested in. And your parents are straying towards AH territory if they keep pressuring you.\n\nBut you said they aren't accustomed to taking trips to begin with, and both \"became adults\" (moved out independently) at or before 18. Yes, you're their child, but to them, you're an adult and should pay your own way. I don't agree with it, but I can understand it and so I can't really call them an AH.\n\nI think you need to have an adult conversation with your parents. They keep phrasing it like these are gifts, are they intending for you to only pay part of the costs (airfare for example) while they \"gift\" you room and board?\n\nI N F O: Did your parents also grow up without really taking family vacations? The only thing I can understand is if they literally don't understand the concept of parents paying for adult children to go on a trip.", "NTA - but welcome to adulthood. Wait until all of your friends start having destination weddings and invite you but don\u2019t pay your way.", "NAH And good on you for having the financial sense to save your money for things and trips that you want.

Just tell them you cannot afford expenses like that. Nothing \"spoiled child\" about it.", "NTA. But next time they tell you about a great vacation, don't assume they're going to pay your way.
