It's easy enough to use the threat of not paying for college to force your older daughter into spending time with her younger sister. But it sounds like there's already a bunch of problems and probably resentment if she's been avoiding  her so much. Holding her college tuition over her head and forcing her into regular interactions is only going to make that worse. Do you want them to have a relationship that's built purely on you holding things over her head? Do you want your older daughter to resent her even more?\n\nAnd what are you going to do when she graduates? Or takes out loans? Or finds some other way out from under your thumb? She's a smart kid, and has already been determined enough to find excuses. What are you going to hold over her head next?\n\nIf you want her to *want* a relationship with her sister, you're going to have to change how you're handling this.

But guess what. That won't make her love her sister more. It will make her resent you though. And as soon as she moves out she won't spend any time with her sister or you.", " YTA. See this from your daughter's point of view. She spent a large chunk of her childhood playing second fiddle to her sister, because her sister has additional needs. Think of the things she has probably missed out on on all the weekends her sister was home, because her sister would have come first. She probably has some (understandable) resentment towards her sister and you as her parents. This isn't a dig at your parenting at all, you did what you had to in a difficult situation, but her feelings about it all are very valid. She probably sees her turning 18 and going to college as a chance to lead her own life.\n\nYou can't force a relationship that your daughter doesn't want. If your younger daughter didn't have additional needs would you be trying to force a relationship between the two of them?\n\nDo you really think blackmailing your daughter will college will make your daughter want to come home?

And punishing one because she has thoughts, wants, needs, and so on beyond what YOU want her to do is extremely abusive.

All you're doing is making sure that your 18y resents her sister, and the only reason you want to force a relationship with the 16y is because it would benefit the 16y and you. \n\nParenting a child with disabilities is challenging.

You\u2019re likely the kind of person that your daughter will be writing about on AITAH that you expect her to take over caring for her special needs sister and hold the fact that you paid for her education over her head.

Holding her college tuition (which I'm sure you already promised her, on the sole condition that she attends college) over her head is not going to make her a \"better\" sister.\n\nMost siblings go off and do their own things around this age, anyways. \n\nI think it's best if you simply have a conversation about your thoughts and feelings, and let your daughter make her own decisions for now. It's probably better in the long run.", "YTA - If you think forcing your older daughter to spend time with her sister is going to be a positive experience for either of them, you are wrong. \n\nSure, you are not obligated to pay for your daughter's college education. But what do you think the outcome of that kind of ultimatum is going to be? Either you pay for college and she grudgingly spends time with you and her sister till she graduates and then goes no contact.

It's extremely difficult growing up alongside a sibling with special needs - apart from behavioral issues, there's the allocation of time, resources, parental attention, etc. It can be downright traumatic depending on the circumstances. I completely understand why you want your daughters to spend time together, but your 18yo finally has a bit of freedom after a lifetime of everything being about her sister. If you force her to visit now, you'll just add to that resentment. Give her space and freedom to choose for herself how much time she spends with her sister, and try to respect her boundaries. Your 18yo will probably be more willing to have a relationship with her sister down the line if she's not forced into it now.", "Dude, that\u2019s an excellent parenting choice\u2026.if you want your daughter to move out and never speak to you again.

From my own experience, I don't think this is the case, even the autistic sister never does anything that would suggest this - many autistic individuals will still crave interactions with family and friends (and potential friends), but will completely lack the ability to engage.  This will put the burden on the parents to try and make this happen, which is what may be happening here.\n\nWhile it is reasonable given her age, that sometimes the older sister will be busy and living her life beyond her family, I don't think it is an unreasonable expectation for her to be present with her sister.\n\nThat said, the threat of paying for college probably isn't the way to go about it.

I could be way off base, but I've seen this happen over and over, so it's very possible I'm close if not right on the money here. \n\nYou had to remove your daughter from the home for behavioral issues (if they were violent, you're an even bigger AH). Most likely, you had to focus a lot on her in her earlier years when she was at home. You probably put older daughters' needs last, made her adjust her life so your younger daughters needs (i.e., Dr appts, specialist appts, hospital visits, inability to cope in public, etc) were handled at the cost of your oldest. And just because your youngest isn't in the home anymore doesn't mean you've been making your oldest feel of any importance. I'm sure you have your youngest daughter on your mind all the time and constantly worrying about what else she requires for care (as you should be) but if older daughter has any resentment she may just see it as still not getting away from all things younger sister.  Now she's in a home, are you having to pay more money for that? Are there things older daughter has had to sacrifice (sports, trips, after-school activities) because of this? This would cause her to feel some resentment towards you for always putting her last. She may just want to live her life without having to live in the shadow of her sisters needs. Without having to be the sacrificial lamb for her sisters needs. \n\nWhen she wants to be independent and start living her life the way she wants, you want to hold college tuition over her head. You're forcing her to continue to be surrounded by all things sister when she just wants respite from it. \n\n\nAnd while it may seem I'm attacking your parenting, I'm not. This type of thing happens a lot, and I've seen it here and there over the years with family, friends, neighbors, etc who have someone whether it be their sibling or own kids with special needs.

The word glass means people tend to see right through them and focus only on the person with the disability. \u201cGlass\u201d is also used because the children appear strong, but in reality, they are not.\"\n\nIt's understandable and having any issues like that are hard to deal with for parents because you want to fight and advocate for your children to get the best but often times it takes up all your energy, time and focus and can leave any other children (and sometimes spouses) feeling neglected. They understand logically it's not purposeful, and they often talk themselves into feeling guilty because they shouldn't feel that way, but it doesn't make the hurt any less. \n\nI am attacking your reaction. Your first order of business should've been sitting down with your older daughter and having a discussion about her absence in her sisters life. Talking about her feelings and if there is anything you can do to help her (therapy, one on one mom or dad/daughter time, etc) and what she would feel comfortable with in the future (being there 1x a month with sister, how long during her visits is she comfortable being there (1 hr, 4 hrs, 1 full day). Instead, you jumped into blackmail mode and expect her to be ok about it. \n\nRight now, this is happening\n\n\n>I noticed her avoiding her sister\n\n\nIn the future, she will be avoiding you.

Wanting her to occasionally spend time with her is one thing, forcing her with the threat of taking away her ability to further her education and make something of herself is beyond wrong. Additionally while this is not your intention it will create a barrier of resentment towards you and her autistic sister. This is what happened with me and my brother, I was 16 through 19 being forced to watch cartoons geared towards 12 and under age groups because that's just what my brother was focused on his whole life and he had to decide what we watched in our shared room because that kept the peace. I wasn't allowed to watch more teen/adult oriented shows like all my friends were because my brother wasn't mature enough for that. I was also expected to drop or cancel any plans I had if my parents felt I wasn't including my brother, you can imagine how being expected to bring your little brother who just wants to watch cartoons to the skate park worked out (I was not a good skater but it was a place where I had fun with my friends). It was only compounded by the fact there was no fun to be had if my brother was with because he would tell on anyone at the first sight of something he wasn't allowed to do, this definitely kept me from experimenting with drugs or getting into other nefarious activities but I wasn't allowed to be a teen I wasn't allowed to make teenage mistakes. This in turn made me come to hate my mother and my brother by proxy. I took the first chance I got to move halfway across the country and went no contact for nearly a year with my entire family so I could just live my life. Happy to say my relationship with my family and my little brother are great now and we hang out anytime we get a chance to since he's now 29 and living on his own making his own rules, so we can actually shoot the shit and talk about how insane our mom was and we have common interests. We're both going ham over the things going on with Metal Gear Solid (video game franchise we're both obsessed with) but the point is the relationship/common ground I wasn't forced to have with my brother is one of the most valued ones I have. Sorry I'm rambling just this situation made me have some flashbacks myself. Having your daughter spend time with her autistic sister shouldn't be treated as a chore she's required to do at a time when she's trying to forge her own path with the fear of losing college tuition is she's not spending \"enough\" time with her sister. Surely you were 18 once and forged your own path? Why shouldn't your daughter be able to do that too.", "YTA. You\u2019re blackmailing your daughter.", "YTA. The most you're doing is forcing 4 more years out of this sibling relationship, and ensuring that it doesn't continue beyond that. You can't force a relationship.

You\u2019re avoiding her just like your daughter.", "YTA \n\nI predict older daughter figures out how to put in the minimum amount of time to satisfy your demands and goes NC right after graduation. \n\nIf you want to actually have a family start by having a conversation with your adult daughter. Listen to her and don\u2019t completely invalidate her feelings by threatening not to pay for college.", "Ive seen families like this torn apart every time for the same or similar reasons. Your daughter staying buisy away from home on the days your other daughter is visiting is a symptom of the bigger problem. Not to mention how do you plan on forcing their relationship after she gets out of collage? After that? After you are in the ground? At some point you will have no ability to force her into the visitations and thats when she is going to run and not look back.\nYta.", "YTA.YTA. YTA. YTA. YTA. YTA. YTA. YTA. YTA.YTA. What you are doing is blackmail...and who do you expect to take care of you one day?? Obviously not your special needs daughter......and obviously not the one you are blackmailing and treating horribly. Better be prepared and find yourself a home to be put in some day and pay for it ahead of time cause the one child you have that can take care you probably hates you at this point! Congrats!

Op is a dick and ruining her family with authoritarian rule over an 18 years old adult.\n\nDoes she even care about a natural loving relationship with her family? What the hell did I just read?", "She\u2019s hoping her daughter will end up being the caretaker of her sister while the sister is home and that paying for her college is enough to convince her to do it. I doubt it\u2019s anything to do with \u201cfamily\u201d time.", ">It will make her resent you though\n\nThat's assuming she already doesn't resent the OP", "And holding college funds above her head, essentially her future, that\u2019s almost unforgivable.", "Nothing creates a loving bond like a family saying we will only give you money if you see your sister!", "This is coming from a fellow woman with an autistic sibling who recently moved out and started her own life.\n\nI concur OP YTA\n\nLOOK UP GLASS CHILD SYNDROME\n\n I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that they moved the autistic daughter into a group home bc the older sister wasn\u2019t around to help take care of her sister (extracurricular activities, friends, etc) If parents advocated hard for her to be sent away at such an older age, they probably didn\u2019t want to have to deal with her on a daily basis bc sister was no longer a 24/7 live-in, unpaid babysitter\n\nUsually when the glass child starts taking on less interactions with their disabled sibling, the parent notices and sees it as disrespectful. The reality is because the sister probably was being neglected/ignored and put under immense pressure to be a good kid bc her parents would lash out their frustrations at her bc they were stressed with their autistic daughter so much. She finally has her own life and her parents are still trying to make her take care of her sister (even not explicitly stated it\u2019s almost 100% guarantee that\u2019s what\u2019s going on).", "When I was 18, I didn't want to be caught dead with my younger siblings. And they weren't disabled, they were just embarrassing.", "I came here to say this. Im autistic too, and I am really close with my non autistic sister.

It's fine to try and support a sibling relationship, but there is do much you could have done prior to jumping to this", "Yeah basically blackmailing her to hang out with sister", "Agreed. My sister had disabilities and was honestly a terror as a kid. I was not allowed to have friends if they didn\u2019t also want to be my sisters friend. As a consequence I freaking hated my sister.\n\nThat said, when I moved out and didn\u2019t have to see her anymore we got along great for the first time in 13 years. Now we have a great relationship.", ">\"it looks like you've been avoiding your sister. What's going on? What's bothering you?\"\n\nThat's honestly unlikely to be a productive line of questioning. The answer is that she doesn't like spending time with her sister, and with a high needs ***nonverbal*** kid, who can blame her. She can't even talk to her sister. What is she supposed to be doing while hanging out with her?\n\nAt best, she isn't particularly fond of her sister, and it's quite possible she hates and resents her sister.", "Absolutely, with the caveat that OP must accept the answer. This just gives her some room to understand the true issues and help resolve them, not just hear it and double down.", "100%", "Especially holding school above her head. That\u2019s just gross.", "My sister is autistic (there was constant screaming from her growing up), and if my parents forced me to spend more time with her, I would resent her even more than I do now.", "Exactly! Has OP ever had any concern for the well-being of their NT child? I don\u2019t see any in the post and even if the younger child is not physically violent to the older it sounds like the youngerks presence is at the very least extremely disruptive, and possibly traumatic to the older. If OP so clearly favors the younger but even OP could not longer handle her and put her in a home, how bad is the child\u2019s behavior and how torturous to the non-golden child?", "Fr I knew someone in high school whose autistic older brother was sent to a group home because he was beating up his mom and little sister. That kind of information is important", "Im betting money this is the parents trying to force the eldest to basically babysit the younger. You can always tell when parents never try or even care about the one that actually obeyed them because it was always easier to just throw them in the back.", "This is what I hate yet see all the time, the other sibling that never gets any care because the other is either disabled or younger, bonus points if the less cared for sibling is forced to be the main caretaker while they still live at home.\nLike, yeah of course your child with a firm of disability needs more care, no brainer, but when you start to ignore your other children, that's fucked.", "Delusional maybe, but psychotic seems to overstep a little.

It was humiliating.", "guarantee the daughter going to school was doing the work", "There are a lot of parents with children who have behavioral issues, right? Well, in my experience, there are two kinds of parents who will outright tell you that their special needs child has severe behavioral issues: a.) Extremely conscientious parents (which OP has excluded themselves from that category for even thinking that withdrawing support for the 18 would help the situation) and b.) Parents whose children have done something so horrifically difficult that they can't ignore the issue anymore.", "Op hasn\u2019t commented on anyone comments from what I have seen so would love to know what is going through her mind at the moment.", "Yep, I bet it's less about quality time and more about the parents getting away from their high-maintenance level needs kid without looking like the bad guy.", "And do homework, your weekends aren't free when you're a full time student. \n\nYou might party Friday or Saturday night but the days are for doing laundry, cleaning your dorm, studying for an exam Monday. \n\nThen on top of that she has a job so she's really cramming in school work, it's honestly surprising she's coming home on weekends at all.", "That\u2019s the impression I got. OP made the decision to put her youngest in a home because of behavioral issues (which is her right to do if the opportunity is available to her) but to guilt her eldest and giving her an ultimatum.

Slow your roll. I\u2019m not saying what OP is doing is right, but 1. Her younger daughter is in a home and 2.

Unless there\u2019s additional info I\u2019m not seeing, this is not an indication of a mom being a shitty parent, or bc her parents didn\u2019t care. If you haven\u2019t been in this situation, stop jumping to conclusions like this.\n\nAsking your fucking 18 year old to participate in a family trip to see her disabled sister once a fucking week is not too much to ask and the 18 year old is being an asshole.

Maybe I'm just a cynical AH myself, but if I had to bet on it, I'd bet that OP is trying to get the 18yo there to more or less babysit, so that OP doesn't have to spend so much time with the 16yo.
