It's easy enough to use the threat of not paying for college to force your older daughter into spending time with her younger sister. But it sounds like there's already a bunch of problems and probably resentment if she's been avoiding  her so much. Holding her college tuition over her head and forcing her into regular interactions is only going to make that worse. Do you want them to have a relationship that's built purely on you holding things over her head? Do you want your older daughter to resent her even more?\n\nAnd what are you going to do when she graduates? Or takes out loans? Or finds some other way out from under your thumb? She's a smart kid, and has already been determined enough to find excuses. What are you going to hold over her head next?\n\nIf you want her to *want* a relationship with her sister, you're going to have to change how you're handling this.

But guess what. That won't make her love her sister more. It will make her resent you though. And as soon as she moves out she won't spend any time with her sister or you.", " YTA. See this from your daughter's point of view. She spent a large chunk of her childhood playing second fiddle to her sister, because her sister has additional needs. Think of the things she has probably missed out on on all the weekends her sister was home, because her sister would have come first. She probably has some (understandable) resentment towards her sister and you as her parents. This isn't a dig at your parenting at all, you did what you had to in a difficult situation, but her feelings about it all are very valid. She probably sees her turning 18 and going to college as a chance to lead her own life.\n\nYou can't force a relationship that your daughter doesn't want. If your younger daughter didn't have additional needs would you be trying to force a relationship between the two of them?\n\nDo you really think blackmailing your daughter will college will make your daughter want to come home?

And punishing one because she has thoughts, wants, needs, and so on beyond what YOU want her to do is extremely abusive.

All you're doing is making sure that your 18y resents her sister, and the only reason you want to force a relationship with the 16y is because it would benefit the 16y and you. \n\nParenting a child with disabilities is challenging.

You\u2019re likely the kind of person that your daughter will be writing about on AITAH that you expect her to take over caring for her special needs sister and hold the fact that you paid for her education over her head.

Holding her college tuition (which I'm sure you already promised her, on the sole condition that she attends college) over her head is not going to make her a \"better\" sister.\n\nMost siblings go off and do their own things around this age, anyways. \n\nI think it's best if you simply have a conversation about your thoughts and feelings, and let your daughter make her own decisions for now. It's probably better in the long run.", "YTA - If you think forcing your older daughter to spend time with her sister is going to be a positive experience for either of them, you are wrong. \n\nSure, you are not obligated to pay for your daughter's college education. But what do you think the outcome of that kind of ultimatum is going to be? Either you pay for college and she grudgingly spends time with you and her sister till she graduates and then goes no contact.

It's extremely difficult growing up alongside a sibling with special needs - apart from behavioral issues, there's the allocation of time, resources, parental attention, etc. It can be downright traumatic depending on the circumstances. I completely understand why you want your daughters to spend time together, but your 18yo finally has a bit of freedom after a lifetime of everything being about her sister. If you force her to visit now, you'll just add to that resentment. Give her space and freedom to choose for herself how much time she spends with her sister, and try to respect her boundaries. Your 18yo will probably be more willing to have a relationship with her sister down the line if she's not forced into it now.", "Dude, that\u2019s an excellent parenting choice\u2026.if you want your daughter to move out and never speak to you again.

And there are no need based scholarships for kids whose parents can afford to pay, but don't want to, unless the kid is emancipated. \n\nThat's why college is not like other privileges like cars, paid for apartments, clothing allowance, etc. These latter items are things an 18 year old either can feasibly pay for themselves, or live without. College, while yes you can technically live without it, it is likely to be a much worse life. \n\nThat is why it is generally considered unethical for parents to try to control their adult children by (threatening to) withhold college tuition, at least at the undergrad level. I'm not so sure such a consensus exists for grad students.", "We dont know op income to know what their daughter would qualified for", "I'm sorry but I'm going to disagree. She's not selfish for wanting to have a life outside of her sister who caused trauma to her or life outside of the family who ignored her to care for their special needs child . She's been ignored and pushed aside her whole life . Everything has revolved around her sister.  That's not Privileged.  That's abandoned.", "Thank you so much for sharing this with me! I really appreciate your response \u2764\ufe0f", "OPs parents don\u2019t get to BLACKMAIL their daughter into a relationship with someone who caused so much trouble at home that they moved her to a group home. The parents did that. They moved their daughter away. They don\u2019t get to now hold the money over her head and force her to spend every other weekend with a non-verbal disabled person.", "First off, I said \"has the money\". If parents are poor,, no shade to them. I've been poor af.  \n\nUp to now, OP has been willing to pay for school. So clearly finances are not the main motivation here.  \n\nShe just doesn't like that her child isn't devoted to her other kid in the same way she is.   Forcing siblings to interact is dumb.  \n\nAnd since the other kid has \"severe behavioral issues\", te college student may have some unresolved anxiety/trauma  in regards to her sister.", "Yup. They don\u2019t have to take my advice or opinion.", "To expand a little further since you bothered to reply to my vote, I fully understand parental guilt and favoritism of other siblings. It sucks. If at the end of the day, the 18 year old feels she\u2019s being abused or used as a friend for her sister, she is not obligated to spend time with her. I don\u2019t like the financial blackmail parents pull but, once you turn 18, they don\u2019t have to do shit for you (trust, I know) so you can either play the game or figure out how to pay for school yourself if hanging with sis is too big a price to pay for it. At the end of the day, it might be nice if the girls maintained a relationship but if the 18 year old doesn\u2019t want to, that\u2019s her right and maybe they were meant to be estranged like so many are from family.", "Sure but this is also an authority issue. OP stated their daughter does not listen to them because \u201cas an 18 y/o she can go and do what as she pleases\u201d I would not be paying the tuition of a child who doesn\u2019t even respect you.", "The daughter has been in group homes ever since she was 12. So it\u2019s not like she sees her sister constantly. This isn\u2019t a normal circumstance her sister has a disability that severely affects her way of life. The least you can do is actually act like a sibling and at least hang out with her.", "She will not be financially ruined if she just hangs out with her sister one weekend outta the month it\u2019s not that hard or difficult. How do you think her sister feels knowing her sister wants nothing to do with her due to a disability she cannot control.", "If all she has to do is hangout with family on a weekend once a month or so then that\u2019s barely a restriction. She can either pay for college herself or do the once a month but most people would do the once a month option.", "Facts. I\u2019ll be celebrating my 20th college reunion next year and am still paying off my loans.", "So you think the right thing to do is to extort a false relationship between the girls or financially cripple one of them", "There are plenty of siblings that don\u2019t hang out together for a range of reasons. It\u2019s not the worst thing in the world to avoid spending time with your sister. Also they made the decision to put her in a group home at 12 which was 4 years ago. The daughter is 18 now so what was the house hold like until she went into the group home. \n\nWhen you live with someone with massive behaviour problems and spend years taking a backseat because of their behaviour eventually you want to stop being around them and the nicest thing you can do in that situation is remove yourself from the situation.", "I mean yes, she can, and the message that would send is her parents would rather control her to force a relationship with her sister rather than just let her live her own life. Why isn't it enough to phone/come home to see parents once in a while? Why does sister have to be part of it at all?\n\nThe fact that the parents are 1) not just happy their young adult daughter even wants to visit them in the first place, and instead are 2) ruining their relationship with her by being controlling and withholding with the tuition, that's bad enough. \n\nThe fact that the reason is for her sister is just the favoritism cherry on top of the controlling parent sundae.", "The relationship doesn\u2019t even matter if their daughter is being rebellious just because she\u2019s 18. Giving her the tuition is rewarding bad behavior.", "So does she have behavior problems because she\u2019s just a undisciplined child or is because she has a severe disability that she cannot control.", "The two shouldn\u2019t be connected. She isn\u2019t going out getting drunk or into trouble or actually being rebellious or anything that would give the parents reason to think the money spent on college was going to be a waste of time. \n\nShe is trying to gain some distance from probably not great memories and heal. She isn\u2019t kicking up a fuss about the sister coming home, she is just removing herself from the situation.", "I understand that it is something the younger daughter cannot control. I\u2019m not blaming the younger daughter but i do understand why the older daughter doesn\u2019t want to be around her sister. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t matter what causes the issues it can just be to much for someone to handle and they deal with by removing themselves from the situation. \n\nThe elder daughter isn\u2019t kicking up a stink, she isn\u2019t forcing the mother to choose or saying she doesn\u2019t want the younger daughter to come home. She is simply going out and having a good time. Just because two people are siblings doesn\u2019t mean they are going to have any urge to spend any time together.\n\nOP hasn\u2019t mentioned how bad things got or what happened in the home that lead to them putting the younger daughter into a group home. She is doing better but can still be a handful. That could mean a lot of things."]}
