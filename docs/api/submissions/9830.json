My SIL (30F) in particular will ask me questions fairly frequently and wants answers quickly because she gets anxious. It\u2019s a little irritating when I have to step out of work or a party to answer, but I\u2019m usually happy to help out.\n\nHowever, while many loved ones ask me medical questions, that\u2019s the ONLY thing SIL does when she communicates with me. Other loved ones who ask me questions will check in, see how I\u2019m doing, call to catch up regularly. SIL never does any of that, only communication is when she has a crisis and she needs answers immediately.\n\nI\u2019ve started to resent this, especially because her attitude contributed to me and my husband missing our honeymoon. My wedding was in my husband\u2019s home country this past summer (I\u2019m from US, his family is in Europe) and my dad got really sick the day after the wedding. Dad has underlying conditions so he needed to go to the hospital. SIL didn\u2019t let my brother (her husband) help with the situation because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want her vacation ruined\u201d, so my husband and I missed our honeymoon to stay with my dad in the hospital while my brother and SIL went to the beach for 4 days. I understand my medical training made me better equipped, but I would have appreciated at least an offer to help us out when we needed it.  SIL didn\u2019t even congratulate us on our wedding when she was there\n\nToday, I got pulled out of our superbowl party because my SIL (now pregnant), had cold symptoms and a low grade fever and was panicked. I talked her down but I\u2019m tired of being expected to be on call as a consultant for someone who doesn\u2019t seem to care about me at all. I only imagine it\u2019s going to get worse now that she\u2019s pregnant.\n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA if I told her to please stop asking me questions and to consult her actual doctor instead?\n\nEdit: because others have brought it up\u2014I never give advice about individual\u2019s medical conditions, prescriptions etc I answer basic questions like is Tylenol the same as ibuprofen? Most advice I give is actually how to navigate the medical system (e.g. should I call my doctor if it\u2019s been two weeks and I haven\u2019t been contacted about scheduling a test the they wanted?) I don\u2019t give advice on specific conditions\n\nWith SIL I actually mostly tell her to ask her doctor unless it\u2019s a simple/generic question like I mentioned but she seems to feel the need to call and ask me first regardless.\n\nEdit 2: thanks for the advice everyone! Way more of you responded than I expected! I appreciate the actionable steps that folks recommended to help me set a healthy boundary.", "created_utc": 1676262117, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110z8m1/wibta_if_i_told_my_sil_to_stop_asking_me/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s going to be upset, as it is convenient for her to USE you.  Be prepared for this, and be ok with her being upset. You can\u2019t please everyone and she needs to learn boundaries. My brother and SIL are both physicians, and I am always very aware to not go to them too often, and I am considerate of their feelings.

Once he is aware that you are going to act, and that you're sorry it may backlash on him but it's starting to affect your personal AND professional life (you stepping out of work to deal with it IS affecting your professional life) then you can tell SIL that enough is enough. Tell her that you will answer her questions when you are free and have the time, but you will no longer interrupt your work or any social events that you are attending to pander to her needing to know immediately. Tell her that if it is an emergency she needs to go to the ER or minor ER, not contact you because there won't be anything you can do other than tell her that anyway. Tell her to google anything that is comparison (ibuprofen vs. acetaminophen) and if she is still confused, call her own doctor and not you.", "NTA  \nFellow physician here (\\~general medicine resident)  \nNOOO! BOUNDARIES!!!  \nIt never works to be the \"unpaid, always oncall medical consultant\" to friends and family!!!  \n\n\nI got friends calling from all over for trivial stuff! One friend got a his grandma admitted, to a hospital in our hometown, (not wear I work btw), and wanted me to go there and see her! I have never seen this grandma, and have not seen this friend in more than 5 years!  \nGot another friend who's friend got infected with an infectious disease, and wanted me to give a second opinion, but when I asked for more info, he was all rude, and ended up shouting in filth, he essentially wanted me to diss out the other doctor though \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  \nAnother friend called me while I was doing ICU rounds and wanted help with an emergency with her mother, and I stepped out thinking it was an MI or something, only to know that she was asking for a medication to improve her appetite!  I got tons of such stories! And I learned this the hard way!  \n\n\nSo TLDR, the moral here is to set boundaries, your SIL may get pissed off, but essentially this relationship is eating into your sanity. Imagine if she called while the hospital is trying to contact you? or while tending to an emergency?   \nMy advice, is to set a different notification for her contact, a silent one, and then call her whenever you are free, or just sent a text that you are busy and call later.

There was no need to leave your party, you should have told your brother to take her to a doctor to be examined.

You have to get comfortable doing the same.", "Tell her you are a physician  but NOT her physician.  Tell her to call them or go to the ER.

First, don't answer her calls/ texts immediately. Reply that evening (or the next day) that you were unable to take the call due to either being with patients or having put the phone down once you were off the clock. \n\nWhen she calls and starts with the questions, you can jokingly reply anything from \"oh, I thought you were calling to invite us to the movies, not just to play doctor\" or (after helping her) \"okay, just call my office in the morning and they can collect the copay for this visit.\"\n\nSecond, remind her that her own doctor would be the best option, especially if you don't have OBGYN training.  For the party, give a short reply to help her stop panicking, then tell her you'd be happy to discuss further if she'd like to make an appointment in the morning.

Call your own and ask them.\" \n\nFair enough, and correct, my doc knows my full history, knows me, and is the better choice to contact (though getting through sometimes takes several days).\n\nI think this is the stand you need to take with your SIL. If she contacts you about some medical issue (unless there is an obvious medical emergency that you feel needs your attention directly of course) you should reply with \"I think you should call your doctor, they have your medical history and can answer that better than I can.\" If she becomes insistent, \"I know you're worried, maybe you should call your doctor's office before they close so you can get seen sooner.\" etc. Just a suggestion and best of luck.", "NTA.

It takes decades for them to wise up and leave, if ever.\n\nYou keep strong boundaries and you let them know that you will be there for them whenever they choose to leave their toxic partners.\n\nAnd then you protect yourself and your family from said toxic partners.", "I think you just need to talk to her about it and see how she responds.
