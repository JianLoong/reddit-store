It is not an offence to be nude in your own garden at all. Not to mention you told her to go naked then got upset when she did, cmon dude grow up.\n\nIf it is your house then it could potentially be N A H as you can broach the subject of her not doing it in your home but still kinda being an asshole because **YOU TOLD HER TO GO NUDE!!!**\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to be with someone who is comfortable with being nude in their own garden that is 100% your problem, break up if it bothers you that much. People have different views on it and that\u2019s okay but you don\u2019t have the right to police what she does in her own back garden.\n\nETA: if this is one of those American things where people get their panties in a twist over topless sunbathing tell your gf to come to Europe. She will feel right at home. We don\u2019t care if you wanna skinny dip in your own back garden, we won\u2019t be offended if we accidentally see a neighbours ass if they sunbathe in their garden. This is one of those post where it has a huge divide between conservative countries such as America and more European countries where nudity isn\u2019t seen as inherently sexual.", "INFO: Why are you against her being naked? And where do you live? \n\nThis a genuine question, I\u2019m really wondering. She\u2019s done it many times before so obviously no one freaks out immediately and there hasn\u2019t been a negative impact as far as both of you can tell. So what is it about? Is it mostly about the guy next door, that you think he wanks to her? Would you mind her going naked if only women lived around? Or is just it that you think generally no one (man/woman/child) should be naked in a garden? \n\nWhere do you live? Cultures treat nudity very different so you\u2019ll get responses that are tainted by the culture of origin. Where I live being nude in your garden would be weird but alright, similar to being in underwear (looking at you, neighbor in your tighty whitey watering your lawn!). Culture matters a lot here. Naked bodies are not automatically sexualized everywhere. There was a post the other day where someone was asked to cover up their tattoos (which include nudity) around kids. That sounded insane to me! But again, culture and whether or not bathing naked or being naked in a sauna is acceptable.", "If she wants to be naked and in plain view of other people that's her choice.

What's wrong with you .", "YTA\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t mind the risk of being seen, you shouldn\u2019t mind if she gets seen, either. Seeing a woman naked in a hot tub is not the same thing as a guy jerking off in front of you on a bus\u2014if a child happened to be visiting your neighbor or something and saw, it wouldn\u2019t be a trauma thing. She\u2019s allowed to be naked in her own backyard.", "Yes YTA. Stop being a fucking prude.", "YTA.\n\nThis is a really weird way to express your feelings. Do you even know your neighbor?

Don\u2019t do that.", "YTA. Itd be one thing if shes strutting around in public. But, its her hot tub and her garden. I dont understand the \u201comg, he cant believe his luck\u201d as if its the best thing on earth to see a naked woman randomly. As if theres not an abundance of porn out there. A quick view of a girl in a back yard isnt a big deal.", "Christ some you are programmed to be such narcs and prudes it\u2019s absurd. \u201cOh it\u2019s illegal to be nude.\u201d Okay first of all, if the couple has neighbors that can see into their jacuzzi, it\u2019s probably a small garden that would take the GF like all of 10 seconds of nudity to go into the hot tub. \n\nSecond it\u2019s very easy not to actively stare at a naked person. Some of you act like you\u2019re physically incapable of doing so. And if you are that\u2019s because you literally want to stare instead of minding your business. \n\nYes public nudity laws exist but I think as adults we should be smart enough to know a woman walking to her hot tub in her own property and some perv flashing kids. Like cmon. But no some of you are such narcs, you can\u2019t wait to pull out the legality links. Like the dummy above who says some people will justify walking around Walmart naked. How is that the same scenario? \n\nAlso OP if you\u2019re such an insecure prude why not be with someone who\u2019s also prudish. There are plenty of women out there, like case in point this thread, who are happy to walk around as covered up as possible in their own guarding and wear a one piece bathing suit.
