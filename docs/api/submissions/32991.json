I was annoyed because I can't eat that, and he got defensive because I told him it was his choice and that's what he chose. \n\nI didn't think I had to specify \"You can pick something for us, but we both have to be able to eat it.\" I thought that was implied, why order food for someone knowing they can't eat it? But he thinks 'whatever' means 'whatever' and that it's my fault. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: just to clarify, we always take turns deciding where to eat / where to order, and we eat together a lot so we know what the other person likes / doesn't eat. \n\nWe usually decide for outselves like \"you want to order from X place? Get me Y\" But at times we just have the other person order, like if one of us is running late or busy with something else. I was in the shower when he told me he was ordering Italian, so I just yelled for him to pick something.  \n\nHe's aware I can't eat shellfish, and he's aware shrimp are shellfish, and he was aware he was ordering for me as well since he got 2 portions. \n\n\nEdit 2: I'm sorry if it wasn't clear, we take turns picking where to eat, we don't (usually) order for each other, but we have if the other person was late/ busy.

I\u2019m a little perplexed with his choices.  I could get maybe he forgot you hated pickles or ketchup and didn\u2019t have those omitted but something that can make you sick or possibly kill you?  I don\u2019t know how someone forgets that at all", "He's either an idiot or an AH.\n\nWhatever he wants automatically includes \"but doesn't potentially kill me\". \n\nDon't know how severe your allergy is. If it's not that bad, ordering that for himself would be OK, but to order that for you is either stupid or was to provoke you. Maybe start by figuring out which one. \n\nNTA", "NTA. He ordered something for you to eat that will get you in the hospital. Now the possible explanations can be:\n\n1. He genuinely forgot, but he does not admit that so he is trying to gaslight you that it is your fault.\n2. He didn't forget, he did it on purpose \"to teach you a lesson\".\n\nI am not sure if there is a third possible explanation. And yes, he is an asshole in either of those cases. It is up to you to decide if you actually want to be in a relationship with a person that can put you in actual physical danger. What if it wasn't obvious that the meal had shrimp in it, but it was instead using shrimp sauce or something? Would you be able to trust him with your food still?", "NTA\n\nAllergies are potentially lethal, and agreeing to let someone order your dinner does not mean you're consenting to a side of avoidable hospital stay.\n\nIf your boyfriend thinks he can force feed you something that can potentially kill you, I think you need to rethink this relationship.", "Any normal person doesn't take \"order what you want\" to mean \"order me something for mine I don't eat.\"\n\nI don't eat pork for religious reasons. My wife isn't my religion. She would NEVER order me pork, she wouldn't let someone else push me to eat pork, and I'm not allergic. Like she will totally eat pork in front of me but I'm not sensitive about that and it's not a risk to me.\n\nNTA that was really mean of him.", "NTA - seven months is more than long enough to have learned and remembered your allergy.  This guy is just either completely dense or very selfish.", "The comments saying you're the asshole because you should have been clearer give me the chills, like everyone ignoring his defensive reaction \\*after\\*, just getting upset at you and insisting on \"whatever means whatever\". If it was a honest mistake he could have just explained you so and felt sorry you couldn't eat. What the shell! His reaction would have driven me crazy. Sounds like my brothers when they were 15.  \nBTW if my partner had a severe allergy I'd make sure I know everything about it and would pay attention to it every time I order. The honest mistake would still not be a great excuse IMO, but still he had a chance to make it right and he didn't care to use it.", "NTA. Yes, when ordering for two it\u2019s normal to be considerate of the other person. You don\u2019t have to specify that. He knows you\u2019re allergic to shellfish \u2026 so he ordered shellfish. What?! What was he expecting you to do, pretend your shellfish allergy doesn\u2019t exist?", "NTA\n\nIf he was really craving it (and your allergy allows you to be near it) then he could simply have said he is feeling the shrimp and asked if you minded having separate meals. Outright picking something you are allergic to is malicious if he doesn't see the problem!", "At first I was thinking \"yeah you wanted him to read your mind?\" \n\nBut *no* this jackass ordered one of your *allergens* and got defensive.\n\nIf I told a friend to order for me and they ordered me a walnut flax roll I wouldn't even need to say anything beyond \"who hired you?\" Like, it's pretty simple.\n\nYou're eating with someone you know. They say order what you want for both of us. \n\nThings that would be excluded from thought;\n\nAn allergen.\n\nSomething obscenely expensive without prior discussion.\n\nSomething they know you actively hate, or are disgusted by.\n\nIt's just so not hard to not.

People who do that are *not* good partners.", "you might feel like you\u2019re mature for dating a 28 year old, but the reason why he is dating a 20 year old is because he is so immature he can\u2019t find a partner close in age. move on before it gets a whole lot worse. NTA.", "NTA \n\nWhat a weird thing to get defensive over. You said I could choose, so I chose something that can make you sick, and I\u2019m gonna stick with that??? \n\nFor him to order it and then on top of that get defensive vs apologize, like any emotionally intelligent human would do when they find out someone has an allergy, that\u2019s a huge red flag. \n\nLike this isn\u2019t a topic or you not enjoying pizza. He\u2019s 28, he\u2019s capable he must be capable of understanding what an allergy is and possible outcomes if contaminated. At 28, he should have some reasoning skills to understand and apologize. Instead he got defensive. 7 months, I\u2019d be out. I would not be putting my life in this persons hands. No sex is that good", "NTA.\n\nIt's absolutely absurd that anyone would deliberately order something they know their partner can't eat, and then get pissy with that partner over it. He either knew he shouldn't have ordered shrimp because of your allergy, and is therefore an asshole, or he doesn't think it's that big of a deal, in which case he's an idiot.\n\nYou will find there are many people in this world who don't think allergies are a thing, or treat those with allergies as if they're seeking attention. It sounds very much like your boyfriend might be one of those people.", "NTA your boyfriend is! It clearly doesn't interest him how you are doing, what your preferences. I think he is a selfabsorbed little prick who needs to get his priorities straight!", "NTA. I'd be interested in the next level of his explanation. \"You said whatever, so I ordered whatever.\" \"Yes, but you know I'm allergic. What was your expectation of what I would do with my portion, and what was your expectation of what I would actually eventually eat for dinner, since you know I can't eat this?\"\n\nHe seems thoughtless, but we all have those moments.

Either he forgot about your allergy, the implication here is that he doesn't care enough about you to remember.

The only valid response from him would have been an apology but since he doubled down I would seriously reconsider the relationship.", "NTA. He is! Sorry! Rationale: A) He doesn\u2019t care enough about you to remember you\u2019re allergic; B) He DOES remember you\u2019re allergic and DGAF bc it\u2019s all about him; C) By doing this, it\u2019s your subtle byebye message.", "Not to be dramatic but he could have literally killed you. Did he expect you to eat it to keep the peace? \nNTA", "NTA what was his train of thought? That you will eat it anyways? Like WTF.
