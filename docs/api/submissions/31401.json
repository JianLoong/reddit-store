And, over time, my dad stopped taking us hiking even when we asked him. Nicole does pottery from time to time, and I've invited her to my art honor society events, but she always declined.

I want to focus one moment on your dad here. He started giving up hikes, he let Nicole answer his phone, he allowed her to take down your mother picture and he spaced out the drive home from Florida allowing your mothers birthday to be missed. He is your father and he has let you down badly. For whatever reason he has allowed himself to move on from your mother and from you. \n\nI judge Nicole harshly for disconnecting that call. As a parent myself you NEVER EVER leave your kids and be uncontactable. It sounds like, in starting a life with your dad, she had no real intention of embarking on that journey with the two of you. Again though, for your father, this should have been a deal breaker. \n\nNow to whether you're an AH for what you said. I'm going with a hard no you are not. Fact is, he has neglected you. He has left you feeling, rightly, like your mothers memory has been ereased and that you are a hinderence for his moving on. The fact that he sees your pain, albeit as a cruel emotional outburst, and all he can do is kick you out says it all. I hope you get into therapy. I hope you heal. You could have articularted differently sure but underlying this there is no regret because since you were a little girl who lost her mum your dad has slowly forsaken you for Nicole. Your outburst was the culmination of how you've been left feeling since aged 11 and your dad is an idiot for not seeing this.", "She sounds like my stepmom I\u2019m so sorry.

At most your dad but I think any changes from starting a new relationship would cause negative feelings for you especially if you haven't had support from him or therapy to handle the changes. \n\nThe trips and nights out: my parents took plenty of trips especially once I was a teen and could look after myself. They had date nights. Your dad doing less stuff with you guys such as hikes is his choice and prioritization and he should listen and do stuff with you still though. It also can be a natural consequence of being a teen and developing your own friends and life and schedule. \n\nChanging the picture over the mantle: a lot of people in public areas make these changes once moved in with a new partner after a death. Your father and his fiance have been together for 6 years, that isn't unexpected to make changes in decor and what is up around the house especially in a very noticeable place like above a fire place. Besides, Nicole put it up but your Dad allowed it. \n\nMissing the birthday is both partly just circumstance and I do wonder if your dad wanted to change this tradition but not confronting directly? The not calling part was very not cool though. \n\nYou said some exceptionally hurtful things. You called her disgusting piece of trash. Besides the phone call (of that is an isolated example) none of her behavior sounds bad to me. She hasn't been mean or cruel to you, just a catalyst of change and rather than direct your negative feelings at your father who might deserve it, by directing them at her it probably won't lead to any outcome you will like.\n\nHopefully your father will be able to connect and actually listen.

Now she has to lie (like at that hospital visit she mentioned in her post) because she is scared of angering her dad if she gets him in trouble for his maltreatment. \n\nThere has been genuine and serious neglect here. Of course OP is angry. She's basically had to raise her little sister the last 4 years, when she was just a grieving kid herself.

Not their mother but a joint custodian of their safety and happieness. Watching them grow and supporting them is the most important, most central priviledge I have in my life.

While I do believe losing a spouse doesn\u2019t mean being alone forever, there are ways to go about new partners and step parents that they are both completely ignoring. My dad got into a serious relationship and remarried 5 years after my mom passed away, but before he moved forward with it he TALKED TO ME, asked me how I felt. I was included in the conversation. And while my step mom wasn\u2019t perfect, she never ever tried to replace or erase my mom!\n\nYour father needs a reality check.

Talk to other adults who can help advocate for you, don\u2019t protect them and their nonsense.\n\nYou are very much NTA", "My dad was like this, he remarried and then cut me out of his life. He is not interested in you any more because he is not sleeping with your mother, I am sorry to say. Some narcissistic men think of children as an appendage of their mother, and if the mother is no longer in the picture the children are useless to him. When the baby comes you are lucky if he even speaks to you. I\u2019m sorry but you need to prepare yourself. And prepare to be cut out of the will or from further financial help because of Nicole\u2019s child. She\u2019s a narcissist, and narcissists are always insisting that they and their kids come first. Isolating him from his first family is a big tell. Combine that with a dad who really doesn\u2019t give a damn about anything but getting laid and there you are. \n\nStay with your grandparents if you can. Watching one outrage after another is only going to make you angry. You need to emotionally detach here because your dad has essentially fired you. At a certain point, with this type of relationship going on, being too engaged is just self defeating because there\u2019s absolutely nothing you can possibly do to get him to care about your feelings. I\u2019m really sorry, but don\u2019t let it stop you from living your life. Walk away in whatever way you can, emotionally, physically or whatever you can do. You are not in control here so don\u2019t engage. Try to get therapy when you can. \n\nIf it makes you feel any better, when two narcissists marry, they\u2019re never happy. But they may choose to stay together because they give each other permission to be the worst selves they\u2019ve always wanted to be, and that\u2019s very freeing if you don\u2019t give a damn about anyone but yourself. To them, finding another person as selfish as themselves is like finding a rare jewel and sometimes they end up in a codependent destructive relationship but can\u2019t break up. My dad\u2019s wife separated him from every family member including his parents, so don\u2019t be surprised if he refuses to listen to his parents and eventually cuts them off if they defend you. Narcissists always have to be right, anybody who tells him he\u2019s wrong will be cut off. \n\nMy mom said after we (parents) are dead, all you kids will have is each other, so maintain a supportive relationship with your sister.  Just remember, some day he will be old, so let Nicole and her kid do all the nursing and changing his diaper. It\u2019s not your problem any more.", "NTA. \n\nYou are a child who is grieving.

It is a father's responsibility to look after the needs of his children. \n\nIt is perfectly fine for him to find love again BUT it is entirely his responsibility to ensure that he gives his children the attention they need.\n\nYou don't need to love Dads girlfriend but you need to learn to treat her with decency.", "I was debating between Y T A and ESH and I have decided it's ESH. What happened to your mother is tragic and horrible. Children should never have to lose their parents and I'm sorry that you have to finish growing up without your mother. \n\nI think that you are blaming Nicole for a lot of things that are not necessarily on her. It sounds like he got really wrapped up into his new relationship and stopped spending so much time with you. You felt neglected and blamed Nicole for this. However, this wasn't Nicole's fault. This would be father's responsibility to keep his life balanced. If you told him you were feeling neglected and he didn't listen that was wrong of him not to. If you did not then he should have been talking to you about your feeling towards him dating quite a lot in the beginning and should have been able to tell you felt bad about it (This doesn't mean who shouldn't have dated. He should have made sure to keep talking about it and making sure you got quality time). You and your sister probably also should have been going to therapy since you have lost your mother so young. (Perhaps he couldn't afford this. Therapy is expensive). But your father is TA for making you feel alone and neglected.\n\n I also want to point out that during this time of dating you were now 13 years. During these years people generally become more independent from there parents. They start hanging around their peers more and their parents less and start focusing a lot more on developing their own interests and hobbies. You were also old enough now to be left alone on occasion. However, he should have been spending some time with you still and he probably shouldn't have left you alone in the evenings more than twice a week or so. He should have made sure he was spending quality time with you on a weekly basis, either through the hiking or another activity. It could have also been as simple as changing the days. This is not Nicole's fault though or her responsibility. That would be on your dad.\n\nWhen you called your father and Nicole answered, did you tell her it was an emergency and that your sister needed to go to the hospital? Or did you just demand to speak to your father without even so much as a hello? If she didn't know Your father was probably busy doing something (which is why she answered the phone.) If you told her what was up she may have helped. If you rudely just told her \"Give me my father, instead of saying, \"Hey there is an emergency, can I speak to my father?\" I don't really blame her for hanging up. She didn't know there was an emergency and you were being rude. It's not unusual for a girlfriend to answer her boyfriend's phone if he is busy and she has permission to do so. She probably could have handled it better. She could have asked what's up instead of just telling you he is busy, but if you are regularly rude and/or hostile toward her then she probably wouldn't have because she would just expect a \"none of your business.\" She may have told your father that you called but he didn't return the call. That would not be her fault, that would be your fathers fault. She only spoke very briefly with you was her fault but she probably didn't know there was an emergency. It sounds like you spoke to her very rudely so I think in this YTA.\n\nNow on to the picture. Yes, I get why you would be upset at that. I also get why she did this. It's her house that she shares with her father now. She wants to be comfortable and happy in her house. She doesn't really want a constant reminder that her future fianc\u00e9 was once married and never fell out of love but instead lost a love tragically. I do think she is TA in this situation though. She should have had your father talk to you before moving the picture or have him move it. Perhaps it would have been nice to put up in one of your rooms or make a photo album with this picture and all of your mothers memories for you, your sister, and your father to have. I find her a soft AH here because I do understand why she did it, it just wasn't very considerate. I don't know if your father was also the AH because I don't know if they talked about it first, but I think you are NTA here for feeling upset.\n\nNow to your tipping point. This isn't Nicole's fault at all. First of all, she is pregnant so it is natural to get very sick. Honestly, your dad was doing the right thing slowing down the return trip, even if it missed that day. He has to take of his pregnant fianc\u00e9 and make sure she doesn't get too uncomfortable and too sick. He was a major AH for not calling though. If he forgot then that is on him, not Nicole. It is not her job to keep a calendar for your father, especially when she is feeling sick and nauseas from pregnancy and travel.\n\nYou were a major AH for the way you talked to Nicole during the pregnancy announcement and a minor AH for the way you talked to your father. Your father does have a right to have more children if he chooses and to move on with his life and find a new person to love (This does not mean he doesn't still love your mother.) It doesn't really sound like Nicole is abusive towards you so calling her trash is out of line. You also don't get to decide who is in your fathers life. I doubt you would ever be happy with him moving on, but he has a right to find happiness in his current life. \n\nI think you need therapy with and without your father and your sister, and maybe Nicole too. Your father needs to give you more quality one on one time as well. Also, I think you are really scapegoating Nicole because she is an outsider, when it's really your father who is responsible for the poor parenting.", "YTA.  Your father is allowed to move on.", "I'm so sorry, but your father is completely abandoning you. Tot he point he called his parents to remove you from the home. it sounds like your dad is compartmentalizing his existing kids. After he meets your step, he wants that life for himself and he leaves you and your sister i a box on a shelf with your deceased mother. It is disgusting behavior from a parent. You and sis probably remind him of your mother and there seems to be no place for that in his life. I hope you like your grandparents, you may be staying there for a while. NTA", "It sounds like you are the older sibling?  You\u2019ve also been put into a caregiver role at a young age.  Where did you and your sister stay when Dad and Nicole went to Florida?   Who watched you when he was out and about?  \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you are going through this. The loss of one parent is tragic and the slow disassociation from the living parent is heartbreaking.  I think the only thing that can really be \u201cdone\u201d is therapy and speaking to someone who can help you through the emotions.  The school should have resources available to point you in the right direction.", "NTA. Nicole isn't the problem. Your dad is the problem. Nicole is merely his willing accomplice. He decided his new family is more important than you and your sister. Based on a similar experience, I can tell you that that's unlikely to ever change. Your dad may love you very much, but he will always put Nicole's wants/needs first. To be honest, he did you a favor by having you move in with your grandpa so you can start to move on with your life. I wish my mother had sent me to live with my aunt instead of forcing me to live under the same roof as her asshole second husband. He died 25 years ago and my mom died 5 years ago. To the end, she refused to acknowledge that he was a total shit to me. As a child I was told that he was trying to be a good stepfather and I needed to give him a chance, that I exaggerated or misinterpreted or misunderstood his bad behavior. Tons of gaslighting from mom and everyone else to get me to shut up. 2 years after Mom died, I finally realized that I was actually angry at my mom but for decades I had misdirected my anger towards her husband. It was mom who put me in that situation and mom could have gotten me out of it. Instead, I had to deal with it by myself as a child and teenager without assistance from anyone. I'm telling you this because I think that as long as he lives, your dad will never see the damage he has done to his relationship with you and your sister. (Even if your dad and Nicole split up and he became a good dad again, he would emotionally abandon you as soon as the next girlfriend came along.) I strongly urge you to ask your dad or grandfather to get you and your sister into counseling. You can pretend that you suddenly realized your anger isn't healthy, you really want to put the past behind you, you want to get over your grief about your mother so you can get along with Nicole and you want to really be there for your new sibling, blah, blah, blah. In reality, it's to help you deal with you dad's emotional abandonment. Do not agree to family counseling where your dad and Nicole would be present unless that's something you want. If they won't agree to counseling for you, check with your school and in your community to see what free resources they have. I wish you all the best.", "YTA, you insulted her.", "NTA. i'm so sorry for your loss, i'm glad you and your sister still honor her and celebrate her birthday even though she isn't with you anymore. nicole is not a very good person, your sister could've gotten much more seriously hurt had you not asked for the neighbors help. youre 17, correct? hopefully, by the time you turn 18, you can move out and can support yourself financially. support your sister as much as you can, she'll do the same for you.", "NAH. I have the feeling, though, that even if Nicole was the nicest person on earth you'd still find reason to criticize her. But people move on after a death. I know who stopped visiting a spouse's grave for a variety of reasons. It doesn't mean the past is forgotten. But it can't run your life.\n\nWhat did your father say after being told Nicole hung up when you called about the injury?\n\nYou are an A H for what you said.

Your dad's girlfriend sounds cruel enough to toss or destroy \"those worthless things\" and your dad clearly doesn't care enough to stop her if she does.\n\nI wish you the best, and I hope that you find the happiness you deserve soon.", "Years from now when your father is wondering why you and he don't have a relationship anymore (probably when you don't invite him to your wedding or let him know when he has a grandchild), send him this post and remind him that it's because he chose Nicole over you. You had already lost your mother. And you lost your father when Nicole came into his life. So you were emotionally an orphan.\n\nOr send it to him now as a preview of what yours and his relationship is going to be like if he doesn't wake up.\n\nNTA", "Don't feel ashamed, dont apologize, and refuse to return to that home. Your father is shitting on the memory of your mother by his neglect of you. Tell your grandfather you do not want to return to that home so long as that woman is there.\n\nGood luck and NTA", "NTA - your sister is now your family. Draw support from each other and be strong. Best wishes going forward", "[removed]", "Nope NTA,for telling as it is. That woman really had it coming and so did your cowardly father. I HATE the selfishnes being reported here on both of them,and I agree with you when you question him on this foolish pregnancy,when he fails to be a father to you and your sister now.\n\nI found this post particularly heartbreaking. I have a father,he hasn't been in my life,but suddenly he SAID he was gonna be there for me and do things with me. Well it only amounted to a couple of rushed lunches and one trip to the movies and false promises of him taking me to Europe and getting me a car.\n\nWell he did none of those things,but on my birthday last year he sends me ALLLL these pics of him in Prague with his new fiance that I knew fuck all about..I really would appreciate a trip to Europe or somewhere..? I live with anxiety and depression cptsd,he was NEVER there to support me,and he's off globe trotting,with a woman he barely knows..\n\nSo that ruined my birthday..then last year he didn't wish me a Merry Christmas and the next day,I told him to NEVER CONTACT ME AGAIN. And that he has shown how much he 'cares' about me \n\nSo I can relate. I am so sorry you lost your wonderful mom and at such a tender age,that must have been so hard for you guys.\n\nAnd now your father behaves this way and makes a fool of himself for a selfish horrible woman..\n\nI wish you the best, \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc95", "NTA- Nicole should never have hung up on you when your sister needed help.  But Nicole is acting with your father's approval. If your father was upset with the picture being moved, he would have moved it back. If your father wanted to continue to celebrate your Mom's birthday with you, he would.  He's an adult and he's making his own choices.   I'm sorry you lost your Mom. It's a devastating loss at any age but at 11, doubly so.  But men usually move on.  Your father has moved on with Nicole. The trips to visit your mother on her birthday moving forward are with you and your sister.  You two remember your mother. As for telling Nicole to 'get out of our lives'. I get the rage and hurt, but Nicole isn't going anywhere.  Nicole is insensitive and a bit mean and she has your father's approval. This is on your father, 100%.  Nicole couldn't act the way she does if your father had an issue with it.", "So seems like to me that you are still grieving your mother and you can't accept that you father finished his grieving before you. I can sympathize with that. You shouldn't hate your father for that. You should however be upset that he is putting Nicole's needs before your and your sister's needs. \n\nHe is still your parent and he needs to get his head out of his ass. \n\nESH.", "You need to direct your anger at your father who is responsible for failing you as a parent.", "The only asshole here is your dad for not sticking up for you. NTA. I've been in this position myself. After my dad died, he was basically a shell, everyone in my life other than my dad had to pick up the slack and take care of me, because he wasn't.\n\nHis one obsession was finding another woman to date and love him, so he'd feel like he was providing me with a family. Problem was, he'd always date these women that would be abusive to both him and me, but he didn't have the balls to stick up for me (or myself).  It's hard to realize that sometimes, your parents, who are supposed to love you and take care of you most, don't even know how to take care of themselves.\n\nI would consider writing down everything you'd say to your dad, about how him dating someone new has made it so you don't spend any more time with you, and you're feeling neglected. It sucks that you as a minor have to be the emotionally intelligent one, this burden shouldn't be on you, but unfortunately, things are what they are. Like others have mentioned in other comments, it's best to just distance yourself emotionally, and find support elsewhere, maybe your grandparents? Its clear your dad isn't ready to talk, mine still isn't. Best of luck OP.", "I won't give a judgment because it sounds like you're young and hurting. I will say to stop blaming her. Blame your dad. He has the obligations to you.", "NTA. Yes, you could have gone about it differently, but your feelings are valid. Life is really unfair sometimes, and unfortunately you found out at a very young age.\n\nMy advice would be to start viewing life as a game in that you have resources, circumstances/conditions, and optimal moves. Stop viewing your father as a resource for emotional support, and look at the cold hard facts. He has money, puts a roof over your head, and provides your necessities. The image of him you are desperately holding onto is a memory of who he was, and not who he currently is. He certainly has his own struggles and is coping the way he knows how, but right now the how or why doesn't matter to you. The sooner you adapt to reality the better. Think before you act. \"Will this move improve or worsen my condition?\"\n\nYou are very close to being an adult so use him the best you can and strive to become independent of him and everyone else as quickly as possible. Therapy would definitely help but you can honestly worry about that later. Every ounce of effort of yours should go towards doing well in school and gaining independence.\n\n\\-----\n\nI have not shared your unique struggles, but have some similarities. Sibling and I were left alone almost every day and night from a young age. After grade 5 was raised by single parent in far less than ideal conditions. Sibling moved out at 16, and I at 17. Many, many years I wasted on resentment and wishing things were different, but the only thing that was actually helpful was accepting the circumstances of my life, no matter what they were, and dealing with them the best I could. I stopped wishing things were, and instead *made* things as they are. Let go of the past and focus on the present and future, for your own sake.", "NTA.  You\u2019re a kid and they are the grown ups.  Your father should not be putting this lady ahead of his kids.  You should be his focus.  So don\u2019t feel bad.  Sure, you could have been kinder, but they don\u2019t deserve it.", "NTA - Your Dad is in the wrong and Nicole is playing the long game.  You're almost 18 and she's pregnant.  You need to get ahold of your legal documents (SS card, Birth Certificate) because Nicole is definitely going to prod your Dad to kick you out at 18 years old.  He's basically already thrown you out of the family home. Your sister is younger and maybe more susceptible to being manipulated.  Especially if they can hold throwing you out over her head.  \n\nYou father is still legally responsible for you. You're 17 years old.  Find out what the laws are in your state if you're US /laws in your country if you're not regarding his parental responsibilities.  Just because you're safe at your grandparent's doesn't cancel the fact he threw you out of the family home.  They should demand a welfare check for your sister.  If he won't let you back into the home he needs to be made to pay child support to your paternal grandparents (and the court might extend that until you're 24 years old).  They have to file for it. Also courts can order parents to pay child support for an emancipated minor.  He just abandoned you.  Go down the bunny hole and look this stuff up now - the clock is ticking for you and whatever you find will help your sister out. Nicole wants 'her' perfect family and that doesn't include either of you.\n\nNicole isn't going anywhere and it's shameful your Dad is oblivious to the damage they've both done to you, your sister, and your Mom's memory.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH. I also wanted to send a resource to you that night provide some comfort/community. An author Hope Edelman wrote a book called Motherless Daughters.

He\u2019s already fitting the horrible stereotype of fathers who get a new wife and start a new family, forgetting about the children he already had. Nicole is also an AH for not being decent enough to stop encouraging the father\u2019s behavior and adding to it. This is so unbelievably heartbreaking for these kids. I hope they can stay with their grandparents and regain some stability.", "Lizzie, I am so terribly sorry for your loss.", "Please do not police how other people need to grieve. I understand you\u2019re trying to comfort OP, and you are relating to your personal experiences but grief is not universal. It\u2019s super toxic for you to tell people how they should grieve or what they SHOULD do with their grief.", "My dad doesn't believe in therapy or counseling. I don't know what made him hold those views, but it's made it harder for my sister and I to get help. I've secretly talked to school counselors, my paternal grandparents, my dad, my aunt (dad's sister), but it's never a productive conversation. The only person who has helped me the most was my maternal grandpa, but we are barely allowed to see him. I've calmly expressed how I felt to my dad on multiple occasions.", "1. My father is well-off financially, and we can afford counseling. He just doesn't believe in therapy or any form of counseling. I've asked and begged the last 4-5 years for help, but he refuses to let me see a professional. So, what helped keep my feelings at bay was having the routine with my dad before Nicole met him. The routine was every other weekly hikes, visiting my mom's farm, watching football, or him attending my violin performances. This all came to a stop a year into their relationship.\n2. He leaves us home-alone a lot ever since I was 13 and my sister was 9. His trips are a few days long or sometimes even a week. Our grandparents would check on us once during the day, but that was it. We would order outside food for meals or my grandma would drop off some food. As for Nicole, she would plan majority of their trips. One time, my dad said he was flying to Oregon with Nicole for four days. My violin recital was during their trip, and my dad knew about it well before they planned the trip. I told my dad, but he said there was nothing he could do. So, I went to Nicole and asked her if she could delay their trip by two days for my recital, but she said \"that isn't her problem\". \n3. I called her and told her \"Something happened to my sister and I need to speak with dad\". I wasn't rude on the call or anything. It was urgent, so I didn't say hello. She just refused and disconnected. \n4. Nicole doesn't live with us. She does come over and stays with us a week at a time often, but she has her own place. There were other pictures she could've taken down, but she chose the picture of my mom. \n5. I don't want to hold hate for Nicole. In fact, I don't want to feel anything when it comes to her. It's hard to dissociate her from all the bad things in our lives because it started as she came in. I feel disgusted when I think like this because this isn't me and I don't want to live this way. It's just hard. \n6. The way my dad is living right now with Nicole is not suitable environment for a baby to come into. I know Nicole and him are not going to drop their lifestyle, and I know as soon as this baby is born, Nicole will hand them over to my grandparents. I know this because they are already doing it to us. I also don't want to hold resentment for another person", "> Or did you just demand to speak to your father without even so much as a hello?\n\nOk, in an emergency this right there? The last thing anyone's thinking of.

It's fine to put up a new picture, but there isn't any real excuse why the original photo would be taken down or why someone would think it was ok to do that.\n\nIt's also important to note that all of these trips and late nights seem to be between Nicole and OP's dad. She's not involving these kids. OP would have been 13 at the time Nicole came along, with the sister being younger. I can understand Nicole not wanting to start a relationship with planning outtings with the kids, but as the relationship grew, nothing seemed to have changed.\n\nThe dad is absolutely an asshole here, but Nicole isn't without fault. The impression I get (and I can totally be wrong since this is only a small and biased snapshot of the relationship) is that Nicole is separating the father and the kids, and the father is completely complient in negating his responsibilities in favour of Nicole. They sound like two shitty people who can be shitty together.", "I'm sorry to hear this. I don't what it is like where you are but in the UK and in most other countries once you are over 16 you can choose who you want to live with. How old is your sister?\n\nIt sounds to me that your paternal grandparents are jealous of your relationship with your mother and maternal grandfather.\n\nIf your dad and Nicole come over for Thanksgiving then you could perhaps try staying in your room and ignoring them.", "Have you tried calling your maternal grandpa he might come get you or send money for a flight", "It's not a wild idea, but assuming it's not important and asking the person who's constantly rude to you to call back cause dad is busy right now is not the emotional torture you all seem to believe it is ffs. That's why I asked if OP told Nicole if it was an emergency or not, because if OP did then Nicole sucks but if OP didn't then whatever, the step-mom doesn't have to go out of her way to accommodate them.", "Simply being in a relationship with OP's dad is not emotional abuse. \"Y'all\" don't know what emotional abuse is.", "Thanks for admitting you were mistaken, it takes a lot for a person to do it.", "Also, I would recommend the r/GriefSupport subreddit.", "That may be a temporary solution, but OP does need to finish school. If she's in her junior or senior year, moving can cause massive problems. It's a crappy situation, but it may be easier to stay put for 6 months and then head out as an adult."]}
