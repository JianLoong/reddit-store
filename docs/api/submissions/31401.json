I'll let you know how it goes.\n\nEdit: When I saw how deep the cut was, I immediately called my dad. He was staying over at Nicole's place at the time. When I called, Nicole picked up. She said, \"Hello?\" I said \"\\[Sister's name\\] is bleeding. Can you pass the phone to dad?\" She said, \"\\[Dad's name\\] is busy. I can't.\" And, immediately afterwards, she disconnected the phone. I then left to go get my neighbor.\n\nMy mother was my world. I remember reading books, watching documentaries, and going on road trips with her. She baked my sister and I cookies whenever we were sick. Her and dad would take us hiking every other week. I still miss her even now.  When I was eleven years old, she passed away from a driving accident. It was the hardest year in my life, and it hasn\u2019t gotten easier.Two years after she passed, my father started dating a woman named Nicole, and four years later, they\u2019re getting married. Nicole is younger than my father. After dating Nicole, I saw my father come back into his shell, but it turned into something else. Nicole brought adventure back into his life, but they often went on elaborate trips and frequent night outs. During all of this, I felt neglected. My father slowly stopped taking my sister and I on our weekly hikes. He started speaking less and less over calls, and he even once forgot my mother\u2019s birthday. After she came into our lives, I started losing my father. He just wasn\u2019t there anymore.\n\nOne time, when my sister and I were home alone, she fell down the stairs and got a huge cut on her forehead. It was clear she needed stitches, so I called my father immediately. Nicole answered the phone, and I told her to give the phone to my father. She refused saying he was busy and before I could get another word in, she disconnected the call. I embarrassingly had to ask the neighbor to bring us to urgent care where my dad later met us. This woman at one point removed my mother\u2019s picture from the fire mantle to put up a picture of her and my dad from their trip to Washington.The thing that tipped me over was when she made my father forget about my mother\u2019s birthday. Every year, my sister and I go with our father to visit my mother on her birthday. It was an annual tradition even before Nicole entered our lives. Nicole and my father went on a trip to Florida and were supposed to be back three days before my mother\u2019s birthday. But, because this woman is motion sick, my father decided to break the drive back into small intervals to make it easier on her. Because of this, he ended up missing our annual trip. He didn\u2019t even call us.\n\nNot even a week later, my father has the nerve to tell us about an \u201cexciting surprise\u201d...Nicole is pregnant. I get angry and tell my father \u201cyou need to knock her ass up when you can\u2019t even be here for us\u201d. I then look at Nicole and tell her she is a disgusting piece of trash and to get out of our lives. My father gets angry and yells at me to go up to my room. Later, my grandpa unexpectedly came over to pick me up. My father didn\u2019t text me shit. Even as I left, he wouldn\u2019t even look at me. It\u2019s been two days, and I\u2019m still at my grandparent's home.I feel ashamed for saying what I said, yet I don\u2019t feel overwhelming regret.

I want to focus one moment on your dad here. He started giving up hikes, he let Nicole answer his phone, he allowed her to take down your mother picture and he spaced out the drive home from Florida allowing your mothers birthday to be missed. He is your father and he has let you down badly. For whatever reason he has allowed himself to move on from your mother and from you. \n\nI judge Nicole harshly for disconnecting that call. As a parent myself you NEVER EVER leave your kids and be uncontactable. It sounds like, in starting a life with your dad, she had no real intention of embarking on that journey with the two of you. Again though, for your father, this should have been a deal breaker. \n\nNow to whether you're an AH for what you said. I'm going with a hard no you are not. Fact is, he has neglected you. He has left you feeling, rightly, like your mothers memory has been ereased and that you are a hinderence for his moving on. The fact that he sees your pain, albeit as a cruel emotional outburst, and all he can do is kick you out says it all. I hope you get into therapy. I hope you heal. You could have articularted differently sure but underlying this there is no regret because since you were a little girl who lost her mum your dad has slowly forsaken you for Nicole. Your outburst was the culmination of how you've been left feeling since aged 11 and your dad is an idiot for not seeing this.", "She sounds like my stepmom I\u2019m so sorry.

At most your dad but I think any changes from starting a new relationship would cause negative feelings for you especially if you haven't had support from him or therapy to handle the changes. \n\nThe trips and nights out: my parents took plenty of trips especially once I was a teen and could look after myself. They had date nights. Your dad doing less stuff with you guys such as hikes is his choice and prioritization and he should listen and do stuff with you still though. It also can be a natural consequence of being a teen and developing your own friends and life and schedule. \n\nChanging the picture over the mantle: a lot of people in public areas make these changes once moved in with a new partner after a death. Your father and his fiance have been together for 6 years, that isn't unexpected to make changes in decor and what is up around the house especially in a very noticeable place like above a fire place. Besides, Nicole put it up but your Dad allowed it. \n\nMissing the birthday is both partly just circumstance and I do wonder if your dad wanted to change this tradition but not confronting directly? The not calling part was very not cool though. \n\nYou said some exceptionally hurtful things. You called her disgusting piece of trash. Besides the phone call (of that is an isolated example) none of her behavior sounds bad to me. She hasn't been mean or cruel to you, just a catalyst of change and rather than direct your negative feelings at your father who might deserve it, by directing them at her it probably won't lead to any outcome you will like.\n\nHopefully your father will be able to connect and actually listen.

Now she has to lie (like at that hospital visit she mentioned in her post) because she is scared of angering her dad if she gets him in trouble for his maltreatment. \n\nThere has been genuine and serious neglect here. Of course OP is angry. She's basically had to raise her little sister the last 4 years, when she was just a grieving kid herself.

Not their mother but a joint custodian of their safety and happieness. Watching them grow and supporting them is the most important, most central priviledge I have in my life. In comparison to them, nothing else matters. Your dad is the catalyst in a sad cascade of events leading up to your outburst. \n\nI wish I could speak to your father.

While I do believe losing a spouse doesn\u2019t mean being alone forever, there are ways to go about new partners and step parents that they are both completely ignoring. My dad got into a serious relationship and remarried 5 years after my mom passed away, but before he moved forward with it he TALKED TO ME, asked me how I felt. I was included in the conversation. And while my step mom wasn\u2019t perfect, she never ever tried to replace or erase my mom!\n\nYour father needs a reality check. He has children that need him to a father and he\u2019s too busy being Nicole\u2019s boyfriend. Talk to other adults who can help advocate for you, don\u2019t protect them and their nonsense.\n\nYou are very much NTA", "My dad was like this, he remarried and then cut me out of his life. He is not interested in you any more because he is not sleeping with your mother, I am sorry to say. Some narcissistic men think of children as an appendage of their mother, and if the mother is no longer in the picture the children are useless to him. When the baby comes you are lucky if he even speaks to you. I\u2019m sorry but you need to prepare yourself. And prepare to be cut out of the will or from further financial help because of Nicole\u2019s child. She\u2019s a narcissist, and narcissists are always insisting that they and their kids come first. Isolating him from his first family is a big tell. Combine that with a dad who really doesn\u2019t give a damn about anything but getting laid and there you are. \n\nStay with your grandparents if you can. Watching one outrage after another is only going to make you angry. You need to emotionally detach here because your dad has essentially fired you. At a certain point, with this type of relationship going on, being too engaged is just self defeating because there\u2019s absolutely nothing you can possibly do to get him to care about your feelings. I\u2019m really sorry, but don\u2019t let it stop you from living your life. Walk away in whatever way you can, emotionally, physically or whatever you can do. You are not in control here so don\u2019t engage. Try to get therapy when you can. \n\nIf it makes you feel any better, when two narcissists marry, they\u2019re never happy. But they may choose to stay together because they give each other permission to be the worst selves they\u2019ve always wanted to be, and that\u2019s very freeing if you don\u2019t give a damn about anyone but yourself. To them, finding another person as selfish as themselves is like finding a rare jewel and sometimes they end up in a codependent destructive relationship but can\u2019t break up. My dad\u2019s wife separated him from every family member including his parents, so don\u2019t be surprised if he refuses to listen to his parents and eventually cuts them off if they defend you. Narcissists always have to be right, anybody who tells him he\u2019s wrong will be cut off. \n\nMy mom said after we (parents) are dead, all you kids will have is each other, so maintain a supportive relationship with your sister.  Just remember, some day he will be old, so let Nicole and her kid do all the nursing and changing his diaper. It\u2019s not your problem any more.", "NTA. \n\nYou are a child who is grieving.

No one will ever replace your mother.   And your feelings are hurt because of being neglected by your father.  \n\nBUT your anger is misdirected!  It is a father's responsibility to look after the needs of his children. \n\nIt is perfectly fine for him to find love again BUT it is entirely his responsibility to ensure that he gives his children the attention they need.\n\nYou don't need to love Dads girlfriend but you need to learn to treat her with decency.", "I was debating between Y T A and ESH and I have decided it's ESH. What happened to your mother is tragic and horrible. Children should never have to lose their parents and I'm sorry that you have to finish growing up without your mother. \n\nI think that you are blaming Nicole for a lot of things that are not necessarily on her. It sounds like he got really wrapped up into his new relationship and stopped spending so much time with you. You felt neglected and blamed Nicole for this. However, this wasn't Nicole's fault. This would be father's responsibility to keep his life balanced. If you told him you were feeling neglected and he didn't listen that was wrong of him not to. If you did not then he should have been talking to you about your feeling towards him dating quite a lot in the beginning and should have been able to tell you felt bad about it (This doesn't mean who shouldn't have dated. He should have made sure to keep talking about it and making sure you got quality time). You and your sister probably also should have been going to therapy since you have lost your mother so young. (Perhaps he couldn't afford this. Therapy is expensive). But your father is TA for making you feel alone and neglected.\n\n I also want to point out that during this time of dating you were now 13 years. During these years people generally become more independent from there parents. They start hanging around their peers more and their parents less and start focusing a lot more on developing their own interests and hobbies. You were also old enough now to be left alone on occasion. However, he should have been spending some time with you still and he probably shouldn't have left you alone in the evenings more than twice a week or so. He should have made sure he was spending quality time with you on a weekly basis, either through the hiking or another activity. It could have also been as simple as changing the days. This is not Nicole's fault though or her responsibility. That would be on your dad.\n\nWhen you called your father and Nicole answered, did you tell her it was an emergency and that your sister needed to go to the hospital? Or did you just demand to speak to your father without even so much as a hello? If she didn't know Your father was probably busy doing something (which is why she answered the phone.) If you told her what was up she may have helped. If you rudely just told her \"Give me my father, instead of saying, \"Hey there is an emergency, can I speak to my father?\" I don't really blame her for hanging up. She didn't know there was an emergency and you were being rude. It's not unusual for a girlfriend to answer her boyfriend's phone if he is busy and she has permission to do so. She probably could have handled it better. She could have asked what's up instead of just telling you he is busy, but if you are regularly rude and/or hostile toward her then she probably wouldn't have because she would just expect a \"none of your business.\" She may have told your father that you called but he didn't return the call. That would not be her fault, that would be your fathers fault. She only spoke very briefly with you was her fault but she probably didn't know there was an emergency. It sounds like you spoke to her very rudely so I think in this YTA.\n\nNow on to the picture. Yes, I get why you would be upset at that. I also get why she did this. It's her house that she shares with her father now. She wants to be comfortable and happy in her house. She doesn't really want a constant reminder that her future fianc\u00e9 was once married and never fell out of love but instead lost a love tragically. I do think she is TA in this situation though. She should have had your father talk to you before moving the picture or have him move it. Perhaps it would have been nice to put up in one of your rooms or make a photo album with this picture and all of your mothers memories for you, your sister, and your father to have. I find her a soft AH here because I do understand why she did it, it just wasn't very considerate. I don't know if your father was also the AH because I don't know if they talked about it first, but I think you are NTA here for feeling upset.\n\nNow to your tipping point. This isn't Nicole's fault at all. First of all, she is pregnant so it is natural to get very sick. Honestly, your dad was doing the right thing slowing down the return trip, even if it missed that day. He has to take of his pregnant fianc\u00e9 and make sure she doesn't get too uncomfortable and too sick. He was a major AH for not calling though. If he forgot then that is on him, not Nicole. It is not her job to keep a calendar for your father, especially when she is feeling sick and nauseas from pregnancy and travel.\n\nYou were a major AH for the way you talked to Nicole during the pregnancy announcement and a minor AH for the way you talked to your father. Your father does have a right to have more children if he chooses and to move on with his life and find a new person to love (This does not mean he doesn't still love your mother.) It doesn't really sound like Nicole is abusive towards you so calling her trash is out of line. You also don't get to decide who is in your fathers life. I doubt you would ever be happy with him moving on, but he has a right to find happiness in his current life. \n\nI think you need therapy with and without your father and your sister, and maybe Nicole too. Your father needs to give you more quality one on one time as well. Also, I think you are really scapegoating Nicole because she is an outsider, when it's really your father who is responsible for the poor parenting.", "YTA.  Your father is allowed to move on.", "I'm so sorry, but your father is completely abandoning you. Tot he point he called his parents to remove you from the home. it sounds like your dad is compartmentalizing his existing kids. After he meets your step, he wants that life for himself and he leaves you and your sister i a box on a shelf with your deceased mother. It is disgusting behavior from a parent. You and sis probably remind him of your mother and there seems to be no place for that in his life. I hope you like your grandparents, you may be staying there for a while. NTA", "It sounds like you are the older sibling?  You\u2019ve also been put into a caregiver role at a young age.  Where did you and your sister stay when Dad and Nicole went to Florida?   Who watched you when he was out and about?  \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you are going through this. The loss of one parent is tragic and the slow disassociation from the living parent is heartbreaking.  I think the only thing that can really be \u201cdone\u201d is therapy and speaking to someone who can help you through the emotions.  The school should have resources available to point you in the right direction.", "NTA. Nicole isn't the problem. Your dad is the problem. Nicole is merely his willing accomplice. He decided his new family is more important than you and your sister. Based on a similar experience, I can tell you that that's unlikely to ever change. Your dad may love you very much, but he will always put Nicole's wants/needs first. To be honest, he did you a favor by having you move in with your grandpa so you can start to move on with your life. I wish my mother had sent me to live with my aunt instead of forcing me to live under the same roof as her asshole second husband. He died 25 years ago and my mom died 5 years ago. To the end, she refused to acknowledge that he was a total shit to me. As a child I was told that he was trying to be a good stepfather and I needed to give him a chance, that I exaggerated or misinterpreted or misunderstood his bad behavior. Tons of gaslighting from mom and everyone else to get me to shut up. 2 years after Mom died, I finally realized that I was actually angry at my mom but for decades I had misdirected my anger towards her husband. It was mom who put me in that situation and mom could have gotten me out of it. Instead, I had to deal with it by myself as a child and teenager without assistance from anyone. I'm telling you this because I think that as long as he lives, your dad will never see the damage he has done to his relationship with you and your sister. (Even if your dad and Nicole split up and he became a good dad again, he would emotionally abandon you as soon as the next girlfriend came along.) I strongly urge you to ask your dad or grandfather to get you and your sister into counseling. You can pretend that you suddenly realized your anger isn't healthy, you really want to put the past behind you, you want to get over your grief about your mother so you can get along with Nicole and you want to really be there for your new sibling, blah, blah, blah. In reality, it's to help you deal with you dad's emotional abandonment. Do not agree to family counseling where your dad and Nicole would be present unless that's something you want. If they won't agree to counseling for you, check with your school and in your community to see what free resources they have. I wish you all the best.", "YTA, you insulted her.", "NTA. i'm so sorry for your loss, i'm glad you and your sister still honor her and celebrate her birthday even though she isn't with you anymore. nicole is not a very good person, your sister could've gotten much more seriously hurt had you not asked for the neighbors help. youre 17, correct? hopefully, by the time you turn 18, you can move out and can support yourself financially. support your sister as much as you can, she'll do the same for you.", "NAH. I have the feeling, though, that even if Nicole was the nicest person on earth you'd still find reason to criticize her. But people move on after a death. I know who stopped visiting a spouse's grave for a variety of reasons. It doesn't mean the past is forgotten. But it can't run your life.\n\nWhat did your father say after being told Nicole hung up when you called about the injury?\n\nYou are an A H for what you said.

My father is well-off financially, and we can afford counseling. He just doesn't believe in therapy or any form of counseling. I've asked and begged the last 4-5 years for help, but he refuses to let me see a professional. So, what helped keep my feelings at bay was having the routine with my dad before Nicole met him. The routine was every other weekly hikes, visiting my mom's farm, watching football, or him attending my violin performances. This all came to a stop a year into their relationship.\n2. He leaves us home-alone a lot ever since I was 13 and my sister was 9. His trips are a few days long or sometimes even a week. Our grandparents would check on us once during the day, but that was it. We would order outside food for meals or my grandma would drop off some food. As for Nicole, she would plan majority of their trips. One time, my dad said he was flying to Oregon with Nicole for four days. My violin recital was during their trip, and my dad knew about it well before they planned the trip. I told my dad, but he said there was nothing he could do. So, I went to Nicole and asked her if she could delay their trip by two days for my recital, but she said \"that isn't her problem\". \n3. I called her and told her \"Something happened to my sister and I need to speak with dad\". I wasn't rude on the call or anything. It was urgent, so I didn't say hello. She just refused and disconnected. \n4. Nicole doesn't live with us. She does come over and stays with us a week at a time often, but she has her own place. There were other pictures she could've taken down, but she chose the picture of my mom. \n5. I don't want to hold hate for Nicole. In fact, I don't want to feel anything when it comes to her. It's hard to dissociate her from all the bad things in our lives because it started as she came in. I feel disgusted when I think like this because this isn't me and I don't want to live this way. It's just hard. \n6. The way my dad is living right now with Nicole is not suitable environment for a baby to come into.

Nicole has rose up to being more of an AH  if you told her something bad happened and she still hung up on you. Even though he is grieving he still needs to take care of you. It is not acceptable for him to up and leave you and your sister alone to go on trips anytime. If the recital was planned before the trip he was a major AH there too, and she would have been an AH for talking to a young one that way. It isn't her job as father's girlfriend to arrange childcare, but if she knew that he was leaving you alone on the trips then she should have known better and she would be an AH for not leaving him and telling him off for that.\n\nAs far as the picture, it would make sense that she would take your mother down to be comfortable at the house. However, if she doesn't even live there she shouldn't be messing with the pictures. So she is a full AH for that.\n\nIt's actually ok to dislike Nicole. Even if she was the sweetest person in the world, it would still be ok and probably very natural for you to feel heavy resentment towards her just for being there. The problem is resentment often builds up in you and makes you feel horrible inside and can lead to lashing out. She is very much in the wrong though for hanging up on you, and for going on trips with your father when he has kids at home that aren't being taken care of. \n\nShe does seem pretty terrible. Your dad is worse though. He is the one who is breaking his responsibilities to you.\n\nIt wouldn't really be surprising if they did stop travelling so much once the baby is born. I do hope that you don't resent the baby because if they do I can see that leading to a lot more resentment from you. Please try not to be upset with the baby as it is innocent in this. \n\nI think  you should stay with your grandfather. If he has enough money maybe he can get you some therapy to help you deal with your feelings. I think you should apologize to Nicole for calling her trash and ask that you be allowed to live with your grandpa. The reason I think you should apologize is because you did lash out,  and because  you want your college fund, so it would be best if you could try to be civil. It will be easier to do so if you live at you grandfather's. \n\nI also think it would be a good idea for you to work on your future adult independence. Work on getting your driver's license and maybe a job if you don't have too many activities and aren't having a hard time in school. . This way you are preparing yourself for your future adulthood and you won't be reliant on your father and Nicole. \n\nAlso please be fully honest with your guidance counsellor. They are only there to try to help kids like you. \n\nAs far as your sister goes, she can move to grandpas too or she will have to decide on how she handles her and your father's relationship on her time. Keep in touch with her, but you can't stay for her. You have to go make a life for yourself. She will go make a life for herself. Maybe she will choose to move into your grandfather's too eventually.

My grandpa mentioned that I should privately apologize to Nicole tomorrow.", "My dad was at Nicole's house with her when I called.", "My dear child, your counselor is supposed to be a mandated reporter for abuse.  What your dad and Nichol are doing is child abuse.  No food, no medical treatment, leaving you unattended.  Why did the hospital not call?  They should have reported that your father showed up later with basically no concern from what it sounds like.", "Maybe you can emancipate yourself and live with your maternal grandfather? Frankly, with as wrapped up as he is with Nicole, he may not give you any problems with it. Then you can petition for custody if your sister.", "I'm guessing you have a cellphone.  They are free online journals. Start a journal online and put everything down. Do not save your password on your phone or the web. Manually enter it each time so that your family can't break into you journals to read and/or  delete them. \n\nHave two journals. One of all the wonderful memories you have of your mom.  Write them down so you always have those memories. \n\nThe other journal everything that happens with your dad and nicole. Good and bad.  How you felt,  etc.", "You should always be civil. You'll run into tons of people and situations where you need to remain civil - like on the job. Even future mother in law. \n\nYour grandpa wants that for you so that in the far future you have no regrets about the past. Teens can be impulsive and he's concerned this might be impulse. \n\nNever apologize if you don't mean it.  Apologizing also doesn't have to be for everything said. \n\nYou can apologize privately for lashing out at her because you were hurt and angry,  that it wasn't fair to her (true). That you shouldn't have called her trash, that you were out of line (true). \n\nRemember no one is ever trash. They may act trashy, but are never trash. \n\nYou're apologing for striking out at her in anger. You should never strike out in anger. Some things you can't take back or undo. \n\nYou can say you miss your hikes with your dad and it hurts.   With a baby coming your dad will have less time for you.  It was wrong to take your hurt out on her.  (True)\n\nRemember your dad is guilty here. He decided to continue the relationship even though it was pushing you out. He's more concerned with having someone in his life, to be married. \n\nThis starts and ends with your dad. He is far from innocent. \n\nThere's no point yelling at your dad or saying how horrible dad he is.  You know how you feel and know that you no longer have one  on one time with your dad. He probably views himself as being a good dad - you won't change his mind. You have no control over this situation and others,  but you have control over how you react and behave.\n\nYour dad views you as heading to college and moving out. While his wife will be there with him forever.  He has different priorities from yours. \n\nKeep focused on your goals and the future you want.  Every time the anger, loneliness,  unfairness,  rage come,  focus on your goals and do something to move towards it.  Work through those emotions. Learn a language,  coding, building websites,  create an app, exercise....\n\nI know,  easier said than done. My method was exercising. I have a friend who learned on her own to draw manga style, she's really good and has gotten paid for some of her work through apps.\n\nHang in there, you will get through this and be stronger.", "It's going great for him. Nicole is enough for him, apparently.", "Thank you so much! I\u2019ll definitely post there in the near future.", "Is there someway you could reach out to him to let him know what's going on? Did your mom have any sisters or brothers you could reach out to?", "I plan on calling him tomorrow."]}
