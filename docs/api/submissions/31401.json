And, over time, my dad stopped taking us hiking even when we asked him. Nicole does pottery from time to time, and I've invited her to my art honor society events, but she always declined.

He has abandoned you when you have lost your mother, and would deserve special love and care.

I want to focus one moment on your dad here. He started giving up hikes, he let Nicole answer his phone, he allowed her to take down your mother picture and he spaced out the drive home from Florida allowing your mothers birthday to be missed. He is your father and he has let you down badly. For whatever reason he has allowed himself to move on from your mother and from you. \n\nI judge Nicole harshly for disconnecting that call. As a parent myself you NEVER EVER leave your kids and be uncontactable. It sounds like, in starting a life with your dad, she had no real intention of embarking on that journey with the two of you. Again though, for your father, this should have been a deal breaker. \n\nNow to whether you're an AH for what you said. I'm going with a hard no you are not. Fact is, he has neglected you. He has left you feeling, rightly, like your mothers memory has been ereased and that you are a hinderence for his moving on. The fact that he sees your pain, albeit as a cruel emotional outburst, and all he can do is kick you out says it all. I hope you get into therapy. I hope you heal. You could have articularted differently sure but underlying this there is no regret because since you were a little girl who lost her mum your dad has slowly forsaken you for Nicole. Your outburst was the culmination of how you've been left feeling since aged 11 and your dad is an idiot for not seeing this.", "She sounds like my stepmom I\u2019m so sorry.

At most your dad but I think any changes from starting a new relationship would cause negative feelings for you especially if you haven't had support from him or therapy to handle the changes. \n\nThe trips and nights out: my parents took plenty of trips especially once I was a teen and could look after myself. They had date nights. Your dad doing less stuff with you guys such as hikes is his choice and prioritization and he should listen and do stuff with you still though. It also can be a natural consequence of being a teen and developing your own friends and life and schedule. \n\nChanging the picture over the mantle: a lot of people in public areas make these changes once moved in with a new partner after a death. Your father and his fiance have been together for 6 years, that isn't unexpected to make changes in decor and what is up around the house especially in a very noticeable place like above a fire place. Besides, Nicole put it up but your Dad allowed it. \n\nMissing the birthday is both partly just circumstance and I do wonder if your dad wanted to change this tradition but not confronting directly? The not calling part was very not cool though. \n\nYou said some exceptionally hurtful things. You called her disgusting piece of trash. Besides the phone call (of that is an isolated example) none of her behavior sounds bad to me. She hasn't been mean or cruel to you, just a catalyst of change and rather than direct your negative feelings at your father who might deserve it, by directing them at her it probably won't lead to any outcome you will like.\n\nHopefully your father will be able to connect and actually listen. But I can't condemn someone from making natural changes and healing in their grief as they need.", "NTA What is with this evil stepmother syndrome? women in general are always very good with kids, like aunts neighbours etc are always very affectionate and caring towards kids that are not theirs, women sometimes even babysit the child of someone when they need help.

Can't your grandparents stand up for you and your sister? If this keeps up, both you and your sister would cut him off. Doesn't that bother him? You'll stop inviting him to anything in you life. No graduations, weddings, birthdays, when you have your own kids, etc. Are you keeping your mother's things safe so your dad and his gf can't throw them away? Can you have someone keep her stuff safe somewhere? NTA Send him this post and let him read the comments here. And tell everyone in your family about what's going on.", "You should note all those beautiful memories in a notepad or somewhere you can access them. I also lost my mom and sometimes its good to revisit memories, that's something your sister would love to have as well. Ask your grandparents about memories and anecdotes as well and write them down too !\nThis anecdote with your mom is adorable and sweet, she must have been a wonderful mother.", "Yes! I an glad OP and sister have each other,but it is heartbreaking for both.", "If OP was rude on the phone with zero explanation as to what was so urgent, I can see why the gf was like 'no he's busy you can call back later.' Like, I'm sorry but nothing in OP's post suggests Nicole is an 'inhumane parasite.' Her only crime is falling in love with a widower and getting car sick, what a monster.", "Not gonna say Nicole's an angel but from her perspective she's just trying to make her relationship work as best as she can. On the other hand the father is neglecting his relationship with his own kids. If she is being overreaching then it's the dad's job to stand up for his family and call her out.\n\nI never said they don't have a right to be mad. They do. It's possible for two people to be in conflict without either of them being a monster", "Nta both Nicole and your father are extremely dismissive of both your sister and you.", "NTA. But it sounds like you\u2019re living with your grandparents for the foreseeable future.", "The ADULTS (Nicole and dad) could have slowly intrigued the new person (gf) to the girls. \n\n\nAlso, OP never stated she want her dad celibate, don't put words in her mouth, she simply doesn't want to be abandoned and lose the only parent she has left (living). Which I'd completely normal....plus the neglect/ new pregnancy was clearly very triggering and she needed to get that off her chest!!!!\n\n\nDad is TA for ignoring/neglecting/abandoning his daughters.....and then sending OP away bc his gf feelings were hurt...horrible decision and doesn't help heal the pain he's cause(d).", ">You're the AH for telling all of that to **pregnant** woman's face.\n\nWhy does it matter if she's pregnant?? would your opinion change if she was not?", "Getting car sick during the early stages of pregnancy, when she\u2019s probably nauseated on a regular basis.", "Strong disagree here - it would be one thing if she were working on her relationship by boxing out needy siblings, parents, etc. but this man has CHILDREN. If you are \u2018making your relationship work\u2019 by boxing out children, you are absolutely the AH. It\u2019s the reason I don\u2019t date anyone with a child, because I know that their child(ren) always always ALWAYS comes first! \n\nI do agree with you that the dads an AH too - he\u2019s too willing to abandon his kids for her, and clearly refuses to put in any boundaries. Just don\u2019t think she should get ANY kind of pass for her behavior", "op is 17 and their sister is 13.", "The kids are still minors. \n\nThe moving on isn't the issue, the issue is that he has been neglecting his minor children. \n\nOP mentioned in a comment that she said something to the school counsellor, and that the school counsellor had to report it and it resulted in a police visit. Now she has to lie (like at that hospital visit she mentioned in her post) because she is scared of angering her dad if she gets him in trouble for his maltreatment. \n\nThere has been genuine and serious neglect here. Of course OP is angry. She's basically had to raise her little sister the last 4 years, when she was just a grieving kid herself. Dad is allowed to move on, it is healthy that he does but his children should always come first and it doesn't sound like they have been. He has completely neglected their needs in favour of his own happiness.", "She does understand that you two are part of his life. She was just never impressed upon by your father that the three of you are a package deal. As much as it sounds like she has made no effort with the two of you, for your father, this should have been an absolute deal breaker. \n\nI'm not a dissimilar age to Nicole, older, with younger kids but if my wife were to pass away anyone coming into my home would have to become a lioness for my little girls. Not their mother but a joint custodian of their safety and happieness. Watching them grow and supporting them is the most important, most central priviledge I have in my life. In comparison to them, nothing else matters. Your dad is the catalyst in a sad cascade of events leading up to your outburst. \n\nI wish I could speak to your father. I wish I could hear how he feels, how he justifies, how he responds. Did he ever get therapy after the loss of your mum? It sounds to me like he cannot deal with the memories and the past and so runs forward leaving you two and your mothers memory behind him.", "[deleted]", "Fr. Moving on isn't the problem as a lot of people are thinking it to be. Problem is neglect. \n\nSister got her forehead busted and Nicole didn't let daughters talk to dad but let the neighbour talk? \n\nAnd op and her sister are still minors at that and getting neglected. Wow, dad totally failed to raise them.", "Dad should put his kids first and not Nicole", "Nah, pregnant or not, an asshole is an asshole. Plus op didn't say something too highstress. Nicole isn't emotionally connected to op to feel betrayed or have her baby hurt over that. \n\nShe and the dad have been neglecting, and will probably neglect their future child as well.", ">Because high stress can hurt the baby?\n\nNot his problem."]}
