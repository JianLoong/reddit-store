I remember reading books, watching documentaries, and going on road trips with her. She baked my sister and I cookies whenever we were sick. Her and dad would take us hiking every other week. I still miss her even now.  When I was eleven years old, she passed away from a driving accident. It was the hardest year in my life, and it hasn\u2019t gotten easier.  \nTwo years after she passed, my father started dating a woman named Nicole, and four years later, they\u2019re getting married. Nicole is younger than my father. After dating Nicole, I saw my father come back into his shell, but it turned into something else. Nicole brought adventure back into his life, but they often went on elaborate trips and frequent night outs. During all of this, I felt neglected. My father slowly stopped taking my sister and I on our weekly hikes. He started speaking less and less over calls, and he even once forgot my mother\u2019s birthday. After she came into our lives, I started losing my father. He just wasn\u2019t there anymore.   \n One time, when my sister and I were home alone, she fell down the stairs and got a huge cut on her forehead. It was clear she needed stitches, so I called my father immediately. Nicole answered the phone, and I told her to give the phone to my father. She refused saying he was busy and before I could get another word in, she disconnected the call. I embarrassingly had to ask the neighbor to bring us to urgent care where my dad later met us. This woman at one point removed my mother\u2019s picture from the fire mantle to put up a picture of her and my dad from their trip to Washington.   \nThe thing that tipped me over was when she made my father forget about my mother\u2019s birthday. Every year, my sister and I go with our father to visit my mother on her birthday. It was an annual tradition even before Nicole entered our lives. Nicole and my father went on a trip to Florida and were supposed to be back three days before my mother\u2019s birthday. But, because this woman is motion sick, my father decided to break the drive back into small intervals to make it easier on her. Because of this, he ended up missing our annual trip. He didn\u2019t even call us.   \nNot even a week later, my father has the nerve to tell us about an \u201cexciting surprise\u201d...Nicole is pregnant. I get angry and tell my father \u201cyou need to knock her ass up when you can\u2019t even be here for us\u201d. I then look at Nicole and tell her she is a disgusting piece of trash and to get out of our lives. My father gets angry and yells at me to go up to my room. Later, my grandpa unexpectedly came over to pick me up. My father didn\u2019t text me shit. Even as I left, he wouldn\u2019t even look at me. It\u2019s been two days, and I\u2019m still at my grandparent's home.   \nI feel ashamed for saying what I said, yet I don\u2019t feel overwhelming regret.

I don\u2019t even know where to start.\n\nYou are categorically not the AH. Nicole is a huge one but your dad wins by a mile.

They only think of themselves and don't worry about your well-being or even try to keep in touch with you often.\n\nI understand your father might want to spend time with Nicole but he should also prioritize you since you are his daughters.

I\u2019m a 43 year old mom of 2 and my husband was killed in a car accident in 2021. Our kids were 6 & 7 at the time. I have struggled with losing him-we were together since 17-and even now can\u2019t imagine moving on. My children are the center of my world. We have cried, grieved, and talked about memories of him together. We got each other through.\n\nI wish I could give you and your sister a giant hug. You could tell me all about your mom, and I would share stories of my husband. Grief should be shared so you know you\u2019ve got support and you\u2019re not alone. I\u2019m so sorry and hope things will be better soon.", "NTA. You spoke the truth even if it was harsh. I don\u2019t know how you can improve this situation though, with a baby on the way you may see Nicole become more manipulative so tread carefully", "nta, op. your dad and nicole have clearly put their own needs above yours and your sister's. you had every right to express your feelings, especially after being neglected and mistreated. i hope things improve for you soon.", "NTA.

I'm 17, and I've spoken to school counselors too. No one is willing to help me.

It seems you never made the effort to get to know her and think your dad is only there for you - he is also a person, he deserves romantic love. \n\nFor Nicole it's hard, I don't have enought info to know if the phone call was a misunderstanding, the photo should've been discussed or maybe 2 photos, one for your mom and one for her.", "How old are the children?\n\nAre they 21? 25?\n\nOr are they still in HS?\n\nIt has been 6 years.", "I ran out of characters in the original post, but that's the thing; Nicole never made any effort to talk to us apart from when we go out for family dinners, or when we are at parties. Even then, the conversations are always about her. My dad invited her on our hikes early in their relationship, but she didn't like being outside. And, over time, my dad stopped taking us hiking even when we asked him. Nicole does pottery from time to time, and I've invited her to my art honor society events, but she always declined. We've made every effort to get to know her, but she only seems interested in talking with my dad. She doesn't understand we are a part of his life too.", "If you read the other comments op has said how old they are! Both are minors but does it even matter?? There dad is neglecting them for a piece of a** and now they will have to see this new kid get everything!", "Ok that does make her the AH"]}
