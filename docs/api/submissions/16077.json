An unfortunate feature of this small park is that it offers only one shaded area roughly 10ft by 10ft thanks to a lone tree.\n\nNo surprise, when we arrived at the park, someone was in the shaded area already. I have a small outdoor (ventilated, about 36\u201d in diameter) crate that I use to try to offer some protection, so rather than crowd the people there too much, I setup my own stuff a few feet away, but put the crate with the dog away from me, closer to the people that were there. I didn\u2019t want to encroach on their space myself, but in turn wanted to be clear that I was waiting to let the dog use the shade. As a small northern breed from Alaska, heat is something that I pay particular attention to.\n\nRoughly 45 minutes later, the people there get ready to leave. I take my earbuds out and start getting ready to move the dog crate over. As the people are about to leave, a woman  walks over with her baby and stands right next to them. I look at her a bit incredulously, but she\u2019s ignoring me. At this point, it becomes clear to me what she\u2019s trying to do.\n\nOnce the people leave, I proceed to move the crate over anyway, even though the woman is standing there. At that point, she finally acknowledges us, but all she says is \u201creally?\u201d with a very annoyed tone, as if to say \u201chow dare you?\u201d. I explain to her that I\u2019ve been waiting a long time. She cuts me off and says \u201cbut I have a baby!\u201d. I responded by offering to share, but she clearly isn\u2019t interested. At this point, she has waved her partner over as if to say come quickly. Her plan seems to involve me not being there at all. He comes over, they talk between each other again as if I don\u2019t exist. He turns around, gives me one of those \u201cyou\u2019re an asshole\u201d look, then they both walk away.\n\nAll in all, nothing incredibly serious, but it did make me wonder.

It\u2019s a large space (for him) where he can play with his toys, stand up, move around freely without being tied down and he can sleep if he wants to (which is what he tends to do anyway). He has a panoramic view of his surroundings. It\u2019s a bit like a pop up tent.\n\nI use it as well as a leash/harness because it gives him more freedom with less risk. There\u2019s a large number of dogs in close proximity to each other, some of which are not well behaved.", "OP staked a claim with a dog crate, but what was the mother supposed to use to stake a claim? It seems like the only difference here was that the mom lacked an object to use to make it clear that she'd hoped to get a bit of shade from the tree, but instead got it from OP.", "Nah", "He literally states he suggested they share.", "I think you need to re-read the post. How is the mom\u2019s lack of consideration not an issue?", "You know what works better?

You can let your dog run around on a leash, except you\u2019d rather your dog sit in a miserable hot crate.", "Did you bring him to the park to just sit in the shade?

Dogs are not allowed in all public parks, and even when they are, it is important to recognize that not everyone may feel comfortable around them or may have allergies. The woman may have been concerned about her baby's exposure to the dog or the dog's behavior around her child. Additionally, shade can be crucial for infants, as they are more susceptible to heatstroke than adults. The woman did not appear to be confrontational, but rather frustrated and concerned for her child's well-being.

Don\u2019t twist words for your own convenience lol. \n\nOp was stupid as hell crating their dog in the sun for 45 minutes that it needed shade that bad, over a baby. Honestly at that point what is the point of even being at a park? It\u2019s not running around playing, or even relaxing, it\u2019s stuck in a tiny cage. Meanwhile the baby can\u2019t run around but it does need to get sun so it doesn\u2019t get sick. Baby\u2019s parents probably acted like that because it\u2019s a brand new baby - OP acted like that out of sheer entitlement/stupidity. I hesitate to say the dog was being abused but stuck in a tiny cage for nearly an hour in the hot sun just bc the owner is stubborn?? Hell no", "For sure.

But why not use perfectly good livestock breeds that are meant for hotter climates? \n\n   I have an asshat of a Rhodesian but she came from a farm fam in Virginia that uses Rhodies as their livestock dogs.

Why is your opinion moral?", "Because people will claim whatever they want to so I\u2019m saying there\u2019s no right answer people will deem whatever answer they want as correct. Therefore there\u2019s no correct answer just because something is a baby doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s more important than an animal.
