An unfortunate feature of this small park is that it offers only one shaded area roughly 10ft by 10ft thanks to a lone tree.\n\nNo surprise, when we arrived at the park, someone was in the shaded area already. I have a small outdoor (ventilated, about 36\u201d in diameter) crate that I use to try to offer some protection, so rather than crowd the people there too much, I setup my own stuff a few feet away, but put the crate with the dog away from me, closer to the people that were there. I didn\u2019t want to encroach on their space myself, but in turn wanted to be clear that I was waiting to let the dog use the shade. As a small northern breed from Alaska, heat is something that I pay particular attention to.\n\nRoughly 45 minutes later, the people there get ready to leave. I take my earbuds out and start getting ready to move the dog crate over. As the people are about to leave, a woman  walks over with her baby and stands right next to them. I look at her a bit incredulously, but she\u2019s ignoring me. At this point, it becomes clear to me what she\u2019s trying to do.\n\nOnce the people leave, I proceed to move the crate over anyway, even though the woman is standing there. At that point, she finally acknowledges us, but all she says is \u201creally?\u201d with a very annoyed tone, as if to say \u201chow dare you?\u201d. I explain to her that I\u2019ve been waiting a long time. She cuts me off and says \u201cbut I have a baby!\u201d. I responded by offering to share, but she clearly isn\u2019t interested. At this point, she has waved her partner over as if to say come quickly. Her plan seems to involve me not being there at all. He comes over, they talk between each other again as if I don\u2019t exist. He turns around, gives me one of those \u201cyou\u2019re an asshole\u201d look, then they both walk away.\n\nAll in all, nothing incredibly serious, but it did make me wonder.
