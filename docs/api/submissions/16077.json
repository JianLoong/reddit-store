An unfortunate feature of this small park is that it offers only one shaded area roughly 10ft by 10ft thanks to a lone tree.\n\nNo surprise, when we arrived at the park, someone was in the shaded area already. I have a small outdoor (ventilated, about 36\u201d in diameter) crate that I use to try to offer some protection, so rather than crowd the people there too much, I setup my own stuff a few feet away, but put the crate with the dog away from me, closer to the people that were there. I didn\u2019t want to encroach on their space myself, but in turn wanted to be clear that I was waiting to let the dog use the shade. As a small northern breed from Alaska, heat is something that I pay particular attention to.\n\nRoughly 45 minutes later, the people there get ready to leave. I take my earbuds out and start getting ready to move the dog crate over. As the people are about to leave, a woman  walks over with her baby and stands right next to them. I look at her a bit incredulously, but she\u2019s ignoring me. At this point, it becomes clear to me what she\u2019s trying to do.\n\nOnce the people leave, I proceed to move the crate over anyway, even though the woman is standing there. At that point, she finally acknowledges us, but all she says is \u201creally?\u201d with a very annoyed tone, as if to say \u201chow dare you?\u201d. I explain to her that I\u2019ve been waiting a long time. She cuts me off and says \u201cbut I have a baby!\u201d. I responded by offering to share, but she clearly isn\u2019t interested. At this point, she has waved her partner over as if to say come quickly. Her plan seems to involve me not being there at all. He comes over, they talk between each other again as if I don\u2019t exist. He turns around, gives me one of those \u201cyou\u2019re an asshole\u201d look, then they both walk away.\n\nAll in all, nothing incredibly serious, but it did make me wonder. Am I really the asshole?\n\nEdit: added missing word\nEdit2: clarified hot as 77F", "created_utc": 1682879000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133z4fq/aita_for_prioritizing_my_dog_over_someone_elses/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t personally think it\u2019s worth arguing whether a human or dog is more important, but the principle is you waited there whilst they had some sense of entitlement to barge in front and act rude towards you.

It is made of a mesh fabric that helps, but I wouldn\u2019t have stayed much longer had the people not left. I do also monitor my dog and he has water. It was around 77F, so hot for a dog but not Arizona hot.", "I agree. I'm leaning towards Y T A for this alone. Why drag your poor dog outside just to leave them cooped up?", "Because the dog loves the park and being outside. Since hot is relative, it was 77F at peak temperature. The park is by a lake, with a cool breeze that also helps. It\u2019s why this park is so popular.", "An idiot", "People who use crates anywhere but in cars use the dogs only as accessories.

Or bring it home if you can\u2019t get shade nobody is entitled to do whatever they want to do just because they decided to pop out a kid. Lol", "It's not a baby park neither. It's a public park.

You didn\u2019t put your dog above the baby, you were exercising your right to exist in a public place and also were not preventing her from being there.", "It seems so pointless.
