Okay, fine, I'll go for that reason but I don't want to bring all our paperwork and talk about all the decisions we've made together. It's all just kind of weird and awkward in my opinion. She thinks I'm being unreasonable. \n\nAITA for not wanting to go? Or AITA for not wanting to share our own personal decisions with the whole family?\n\nEDIT: I believe her reasoning for the party is to encourage older family members (aunts and uncles) to get their affairs in order because she's afraid she or her mom will be having to do everything should something happen and they don't have anything put together yet.

No question. \n\nTo be fair: discussions about how to deal with end of life situations are uncomfortable for most people. I\u2019d say anything that makes that easier for people is a good thing, but it\u2019s going to be different for everybody. So I don\u2019t think the party itself is weird, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going work for everybody.", "INFO\n\nIs she asking people to come to the party to discuss HER stuff or for everyone to discuss theirs? I'm getting the read that it is the latter, which is awfully presumptive and cheeky, so I'm in the NTA camp unless I misunderstand.", "NAH. I've never heard of gathering everyone together like this. But it makes sense to talk with folks one on one once you've made plans (like who you picked to be guardians of the kids in case just to be sure they would be a go with that,)", "NAH. Honestly, your SIL's party sounds really potentially informative and helpful for a lot of people. And while I get the push might be for older family members, it's really relevant for any adult family member in the end. That being said, your not wanting to go isn't a huge deal. I think it's only a huge deal if you are negative about the general idea overall, just because you wouldn't do it that way.", "NAH. I don't know the book, but you don't have to be anywhere you are not confortable at. But I have heard of gathering of all the people potentially involved if the situation happens, for example, who is going to be the executor, who are going to take care of the kids, who are receiving what, if case someone is somewhat expecting to get something and they don't, so there is no hard feeling and explain reasons...it is not the most usual take, but she might want to have all the people involved in the explanation.

You are entitled to manage your estate, and how to discuss that with your loved ones. Your SIL gets to do the same for herself. \n\nHowever, you would be better off for the long-term relationship with your wife and SIL to go along with this, be polite and engaged (not civil or cool). You might talk to your wife about how you\u2019d discuss with your sister: avoid discussing your own plans, \u201cwe\u2019re here to support you\u201d, that kind of thing. You can be supportive without being negative.", "NTA.  You're right. This is something to be discussed with your spouse and/or executor. And it means nothing unless its written down. \n\nThis isn't something to be shared with everyone on the family unless you want. She wants, you don't.

I would never reveal my personal information to anyone.", "NAH, we make all this talk about death and what happens in end of life care be this big private thing and are uncomfortable about it. Everyone will die. You may as well make sure what you want to happen happens. \n\nThis sounds a bit unorthodox but I can totally understand it. You don\u2019t want your family arguing over what happens if you are brain dead or whatever. Yes your advanced directive covers this but you don\u2019t want your family to be surprised about it. Telling them directly what you are putting in your advanced directive probably makes a bigger impact so they understand. It also gives them a chance to ask for any clarifications or to understand why you want what you want. \n\nIf you\u2019re not comfortable talking about it that\u2019s fine but be open to what it accomplishes.", "NAH.  It is an important discussion to have, so I don't think there's anything wrong with having the event. Also, a lot of people aren't going to feel comfortable having a discussion like that in a group, so I don't think there's anything wrong with you not going. In other words nobody's the asshole here in my opinion.", "I went to one and it was great! Without spending money we were able to set up our wills, power of attorneys and got everything notarized as well.\n\nThe person hosting had a horrible experience with a family member who wasn\u2019t prepared and it made things for everyone around them involved complicated and hard and messy.\n\nI also learned a lot from the information at the party and we had a great time while doing it. Highly recommend it!", "NAH. I get why you want to keep this private but what happens if you and your partner are both hit by a bus? Sharing basic info with family members for example, where to find a health proxy, where you have accounts (just the institutions is all they need), where important documents are stored in your house (assuming they are trustworthy).

Maybe suggest you\u2019d like to read the book separately with your wife and think about it more privately and have time to really think about everything more thoroughly? \n\nI would frame it as \u201cSome of these decisions are very personal and I would really like to be able to discuss them alone with you so we can decide without the influence of people outside our family unit. Additionally, what works for us may look drastically different to others and I don\u2019t want to have to be put in a position to justify anything we decide for our family.\u201d \n\nAdditionally, if you did want to attend/support you could just go \u201cto listen and get ideas\u201d and say you aren\u2019t making any specific decisions now but you\u2019d love to hear the discussion and make sure to leave your paperwork/specifics out of it completely!\n\nSide note: right under this post was a post in Idiots in Cars called \u201cGetting hit by a bus\u201d and it was a vid of someone getting into an accident with a school bus \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "NTA.

The people who need to make decisions need to know not everyone", "NTA - your information, your choice\n\nHowever, being in the medical field I highly encourage you to share at least some information. Specifically, what you would want done should become incapacitated. No one thinks it could happen to them but accidents and illness happen.  Too often I see families divided over the care plan. This happens even when there is the legal paperwork and it adds a lot of stress in what will already be a stressful situation.

That's just weird.", "If you go you do not have to be specific on dollar amounts etc. but it is good for family to know if you have a living will and what you want done with your remains.  We put off doing our wills until just a couple years ago (we are in our early 60's) It is such a relief now that it is done.  Our children and other family members will have no question as to what are wishes are.  It is important for people to know if you want to be a donor and if you want to be cremated or buried.

One thing that the majority of anyone I\u2019ve talked to is that they don\u2019t think of having all their passwords written down somewhere.  This is one of the things that has caused my friend\u2019s family the most trouble - they had no way to stop auto payments or cancel subscriptions. \n\nI have a book called something like \u201cI\u2019m Dead, Now What\u201d and you fill in all your practical info - where you have banks, property, final wishes.

I think that is her major goal of it. I just wish conversations with those individuals would have been tried before having a party.", "I'm sorry about your grandpa, but I get it. I was kind of the same way before my wife talked me into making plans after our first child. Glad your mom has got a handle on a majority of it.\n\nI'm the youngest but it'll probably be me and my brother who does everything because we are the most responsible.", "Great suggestions! Thank you!", "Fair, although perhaps she has tried? I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be the asshole if you didn\u2019t go, especially if you\u2019ve already made your arrangements. But having seen my family go through this a few times with varying levels of preparedness, I can\u2019t fault her for wanting everyone to just get their shit done.", "You're welcome! The only other information that I could see being important to impart is who to contact if you and your wife die at the same time, if it's different than who prepared your will.  I know someone who did their will from Costco and picked one of their kids as the executor for example.", "True. She may have. I don't know. Good point.", "Smart! Someone else mentioned that as well. My wife and I need to have some talks with our primary people to let the know where everything is stored."]}
