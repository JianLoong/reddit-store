My family of 4 all have asthma of different types. It's not uncommon during an attack for one of us (usually me ,Mom) to whip out an inhaler and use it on someone else.

Most couples in a fight or argument will go after the other person to try to explain or talk about the fight.

He breathes easier and you don't have to worry about him DYING. I personally don't get the big deal. I've been on different steroids my entire life and all I got from it was chin hair!
