They\u2019re all lovely people I enjoy spending my time with. One of them is my fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister, who is a larger plus size woman, let\u2019s call her Mary.\n\nThings started to get slightly tense when Mary started mentioning that (despite us already having a wedding planner) she\u2019s always wanted to be a wedding planner and perhaps she could plan our wedding. Myself and her family politely laughed this off a couple of times mentioning we already have a planner. There were a couple of vendor suggestions on her part but nothing more pushy so I didn\u2019t think was a large red flag at the time, but then came the bridesmaid dress fiasco.\n\nI am paying for all my bridesmaids dresses and have picked the only shop in my city I live in that both specializes in bridesmaid dresses and does alterations in store. I\u2019ve picked it because I know some of my girls are a little insecure about their weight fluctuating over the holidays and the tailoring options will make them a lot more comfortable (although this comes at extra cost for myself). Based on the color scheme for my wedding I then chose from this store 7 differently styled dresses and posted them on our group chat and asked the bridesmaids to pick a favorite. In the end we had 3 potential dresses loved by the bridesmaids but I noticed Mary was the only one to not vote.\n\nMary messaged me privately to say none of the 7 would work for her as she \u2018has a large bust\u2019 I was confused at this as all the dresses came in the dress size she had given me and none were especially revealing, etc. She says she requires \u2018sleeves\u2019 because she doesn\u2019t like how her upper arms look so I found a dress with sleeves. Then she says the sleeves are not long enough so I found a dress with longer sleeves. Then she says now the sleeves are fine but she can\u2019t do a high neckline. So I pick a dress without a high neckline. She says she still doesn\u2019t like it as \u2018her twins will be caged.\u2019 I ask if it will work for her if we can get it tailored to her liking together and she says something to the affect of \u2018maybe.\u2019 At this point, I get a little frustrated mentioning I\u2019d like her to be more flexible and that I\u2019m hoping to pick a style that works for all the bridesmaids and also I of course like over something specific she would pick out but I would see what I can do. She responds that she no longer wants to be a bridesmaid and tells her family that my response was harsh and totally out of line. In the end I finagled a situation with her family where she would pay for a specific dress she wanted in our color scheme on the site and all the bridesmaids would where different dresses in the same color so it didn\u2019t come across as weird.\n\nI can tell her parents didn\u2019t appreciate my message to her however or making her upset.

It sounds like you\u2019ve bent over backwards trying to accommodate her. You can\u2019t fix her insecurities. I fear that she will dislike almost any dress option. If she is this insecure she should bow out of her bridesmaid title.", "NTA.\n\nIm a large girl and really do not like my arms. But I would never do what she did to a bride who is PAYING for the dress. She had no right to try and force you to do any of what you did. Plus, she is bigger chested she needs something that will COVER them not be to the point they are going to pop out. Because some lower necklines can not accommodate a bigger chest.\n\nYou do not need to let your in-laws push you around. It will NOT stop if you do. You need to sit your fiance down and talk to him about this, and then both of you come up with a game plan to talk to his parents. Because this is not right. You have been more than kind to practically bend over backwards and stand on your head for her.", "NTA and if you let your inlaws push you around now, it will not stop", "NTA but don't assume your inlaws know all the back and forth that went on.  Your FSIL may have given them a shortened version of things so they may not know all of your concessions", "NTA. You did your best to be as flexible as possible. It sounds a bit like she didn't take it well that you were using an established planner and is sulking. You're entitled to make your own choices for your wedding and you've tried to accommodate her!", "NTA.  It seems like she is being difficult on purpose.  At least she stepped down on her own.  You don\u2019t need additional headaches during wedding planning", "NTA. I don't know why you bent over for her; not having her as a bridesmaid would have been better, especially as bridesmaids are supposed to be there FOR the bride not causing them undue stress.\n\n>I can tell her parents didn\u2019t appreciate my message to her however or making her upset.\n\nShe made herself upset by making unreasonable demands. Good luck with your future in-laws.", "NTA\n\nI really like how more and more now, brides are choosing a color scheme and letting the bridesmaids choose a style/cut that is flattering for them rather than trying to stick everyone in the same dress. \n\nYou offered all sorts of options and none were acceptable to her. Kind of seems to me that she didn\u2019t want to be in the wedding to begin with\u2014especially if she wasn\u2019t planning it\u2014and was hoping you WOULD be a jerk about it so it would be on you and not her. \n\nAnd if her parents are upset? Then it\u2019s no wonder she is. She\u2019s probably used to getting her way in all things.", "NTA - it's your wedding and you've been more flexible than most would have been. as a plus size girl, it's my responsibility to find ways around hiding areas I may be insecure with. she could have always added lace sleeves to a dress or had it altered to suit her, or she could've simply sucked it up. I've had to wear dresses as a bridesmaid that I didn't feel super comfortable in but that's my issue, not the bride's and I'd never even think of ruining someone's day or making it more stressful than it already is. I usually grin and bear it, and throw on a shawl or a cardigan after pictures and the church ceremony!", "NTA.\n\nYou can only be so accommodating to one person.  She seemed like she didn't like any of the options from the beginning, so she just kept giving different reasons why something wouldn't work.", "NTA. \n\nI'm upsetting a few people by not having my fianc\u00e9s sister as a bridesmaid. Bottom line is if a situation like this comes up I don't want a bridesmaid to have an extra say because his family will get involved.  \n\nYou gave her a huge honour asking her to be part of the bridal party when (let's be honest) she might not entirely fit in with your friends as you only know her through your future husband.  Then she makes demand after demand about your wedding?\n\nYou're a lot nicer than me because I would have said \"that's a shame, but understandable. Less pressure as a guest anyway!\" And left it at that.\n\nUnless your fianc\u00e9s family are paying a significant amount towards the wedding they may need to be told to stop getting involved aswell.", "NTA", "NTA... you cannot please her.   The wedding is not about her.  I have personally been in weddings and never had a say in the dresses.  Some were good some were  hideous.  But, I wore them and enjoyed myself at THEIR wedding.", " NTA it sounds like you tried to be accommodating. Where she was TA was making so many demands one after another after you found individual alternatives to her specific individual concerns one after the other. It makes it seem like she was just putting you through it for the sake of being difficult. \n\nAlso her shit talking earns her TA status. \n\nWhen I got married, I took my bridesmaids to an upscale dept store. I gave them a price limit, and told them to pick what they wanted, provided they all matched color (black, so kinda simple-ish enough). Not many singular dresses look great on everyone.", "NTA\n\n\nMary is trying to make your wedding about herself. Don't let her hijack your wedding. When the next conflict occurs and she wants to quit ---let her.", "NTA. It sounds like your SIL is very insecure about her body and she\u2019s taking it out on you. I can relate to that. My sister is getting married this summer and I am not happy with my weight now. I think I carry my weight well and I choose outfits that flatter my figure. However I won\u2019t have that control when my sister and I have go shopping for my dress and the thought of wearing something that I feel exposes all of my insecurities makes me very anxious. However I would never make my sister bend over backwards to accommodate me. This is my problem, not hers.", "NTA. She sounds like a selfish bridesmaid-Zillow clearly trying to make your wedding about when I do  think that the choice to choose the color but let each of the girls pick the style of dress they feel most comfortable in was best in this situation, for everyone not just Mary. It\u2019s your wedding and if she doesn\u2019t like it she can back out", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The fact that your future in-laws are not respecting you and the fact that this is YOUR wedding is concerning and doesn't bode well for them respecting you and your boundaries in the future.

Who does this woman think she is? I couldn't even stay friends with a person like that. I'm guessing she isn't married, right?", "NTA\n\nShe made it as difficult as possible.", "NTA.

I wore whatever bridesmaid dresses I was assigned and just got a matching shawl to cover my arms. Easy peasy. This woman just wants to be difficult.", "Yes! I\u2019ve only been a bridesmaid a handful of times, but I\u2019ve always just worn whatever the bride picked out. Even if I paid for it and it looked weird/unflattering on me, oh well! It\u2019s not my day. If it was crazy expensive I might say something about my budget. Or if I was busting out of it due to the cut I\u2019d point out the issue and work with the bride on a solution, but it\u2019s still the bride\u2019s choice (and my choice to step down if necessary). OP is being very kind and generous to try to resolve any of the bridesmaid\u2019s concerns.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like the Mary doesn\u2019t want to be a bridesmaid, but instead of admitting it, she\u2019s causing drama until she has a \u201creason\u201d to tell everyone OP is the bad guy.", "You're exactly right it does sound like she wants to get out of being a bridesmaid and is throwing OP under the bus", "NTA. First of all, it's YOUR wedding. Second, well, it's YOUR wedding.", "I have never hated my relatives as much as when I was wedding planning. Everyone had demands. Everyone had complaints. Everyone thought the wedding should be done how, where, and when they wanted.", "NTA.  Are you sure she told them *everything* about your text exchange.  I'm willing to bet she didn't tell them that you bent over backwards for her, and she only responded with \"maybe.\"  Show your in-laws the messages and ask them if you were out of line.  I'm betting she lied to them, and they'll be upset with her.", "NTA But why would you keep her as a bridesmaid just let her leave. She's just gonna find something else to be difficult over.", "WOW does she want want her bridesmaids dress in white so she can be the star?!", "NTA, as a big busted person I was ready to say you were the A H because it can be really hard with some dresses but it sounds like you tried to accommodate her and she is being unreasonable.  I managed to make it work as a bridesmaid 5 times without stressing out the brides.  One possible compromise is she wears the dress with a shawl for her arms?  Another possibility that most of my friends did is to pick a designer and color and let everyone pick their own style this way she wouldn't be singled out, but might be too late for that idea.", "She's mad that she doesn't have 100% control of every aspect of YOUR wedding. Trying to appoint herself wedding planner when she has zero experience??? Laughable at best. Tell her it doesn't matter whether or not she likes any of the zillion dresses you picked because she's no longer invited. NTA", "It doesn't even sound like this is about the dress. She tried to commandeer the situation from the start and when OP put a stop to it she decided to be as difficult as possible."]}
