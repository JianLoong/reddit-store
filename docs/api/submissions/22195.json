Does he do self-destructive things that jeopardize your financial well-being to act out how mad at you he is?

I can understand being protective of your space (if for example my mother came over and tidied my space I'd be upset) but I (31f, married) don't mind if my husband tidies round my things and my nightstand has my medication and jewellery /precious things in. Never the less be understanding because it sounds like your husband has an underlying issue.", "NTA.

You're dating a feral child, tried to do something nice for him, and he went on and started drama because not living among trash is such an insult to him?! Come on, he's an adult. He should know better than letting trash pile up with bugs, broken stuff, and rotten food. You're NTA at all, but perhaps you should consider dating an actual adult and not a tantrum-prone child.", "INFO: Why didn\u2019t you ask him if he would like you to clean it if you were actually doing it because you thought it would make him happy, and not just because it was bothering you?

The rotting food in his nightstand is not cool but I don\u2019t understand why you would test this boundary when you knew he had a bad day. Rather than cleaning, and making an assumption that would make HIM feel better sounds to me like it was for you.

You should probably not have touched his stuff, but he should respect you and your home enough to not make a nasty mess of trash. Three bags of trash, that is quite a lot. \n\nBesides, if this was things of high sentimental value for him - he shouldn\u2019t let it drown in trash, rotten food and \u00absticky things\u00bb. He destroyed those things a lot more himself than OP did by *almost* throwing them out.\n\nHe totally overreacted. It was a mistake on your part, but not so severe that he can never trust you again, that he should need to run away or anything like that. Maybe there is other things bothering him and he took it out this situation?", "Well, you crossed some line when you went against your word and invaded his personal space, behind his back, instead of communicating with him about the problem first. Even if you had a good reason. He shouldn't be hoarding all this trash, but you shouldn't be acting like his mother, treating him like a kid and throwing his stuff away. If you saw spoiling food there, you were right to get rid of it. If there was stuff falling out of his nightstand, you were right to pack it and leave it for him to deal with it. But the rest? He should be handling it. Therefore, technically, ESH.\n\nBut, quite frankly, if he's seeing this as the last straw and is actively trying to run and find a space away from you, that nightstand is the least of your problems.

Divorce this mentally ill weirdo and get yourself a mature, healthy man! Hoarding is an incurable condition. This nut job wanted to abandon you over the plastic room key cards you get from hotels. WTF? There were literally rotting food and insects. Absolutely sickening. Let this baby go crying to mommy and divorce him. You\u2019re way too young to consign yourself to spending the rest of your life with a mentally ill, filthy toddler.", "Honestly I'm voting a soft YTA. Up to touching his nightstand everything I was agreeing with. But simply put, you had an agreement that his nightstand was his, and because you deemed it trash you almost tossed things he valued. While I believe his reaction was a bit much, a clear boundary you two established beforehand was crossed.", "Not sure. You shouldn't have cleaned his desk without him being in the same room and helping you. I know I would be so angry if someone went through my stuff. I understand where he is coming from but 7 hours away is a bit much. You were being reasonable when you said go to his sisters. \nMTA", "YTA. Don't touch his stuff especially if you have agreed on it. You said \"as long as it was not in sight\" and then you mentioned getting stuff from a drawer?\nHowever, to be honest, I don't think this would warrant such an extreme reaction from him. Mental health is a serious matter and this has all the looks of a burnout/depression situation. Please support him and seek help if needed, if that is the case.", "YTA, but only because he thought his area was fine and instead of talking to him about it first, asking if you could clean the area beforehand, you went ahead and did it without him knowing beforehand. To him it was a personal space that you previously agreed to leave alone, albeit he did let it get out of hand, but than you cleaned it and in the process threw away some items that he may have felt were mementos of your relationship, essentially telling him that you didn't care for how he viewed happy memories of your past. You didn't mean to send that message but that is what the message could have been. It's essentially him needing personal space and not feeling comfortable being touched, you agreeing to not touch him, than you notice him having tight shoulders to which you start messaging without warning him. It may have been needed to be done, you may have done it with good intentions, but you disregarded any point of view he may have had and did something without consulting him first when it had to do with him. Also, there may be a lot more going on at work than he is letting on, so he may need some time. Don't try to justify what you did just acknowledging that what you did was a violation of his trust and apologize. He may not immediately forgive you but he needs to at least hear you acknowledge that you did something without consulting him about something you should have consulted with him first. Just acknowledge and apologize, don't justify why you did it, because he may feel that you are laying blame on him. I know you had good intentions but the intentions aren't what matters here, it's acknowledgement of what happened that matters.", "ESH. I think he overreacted if the nightstand was as filthy as you say. I don\u2019t even think you really broke the agreement. But imo forcing him to stay by threatening to end the relationship if he takes the space he thought he needed, is kinda AH behaviour.", "NAH but only because your husband needs help with his mental health, otherwise he would be the A.H.", "YTA for breaking an established boundary with your husband. He has his personal belongings in a specific place, but you deliberately invaded that space, and then undermined his feelings when he was upset that his belongings were thrown away.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I gave him his space when he came home and decided to clean. Figured a clean space would be helpful. I started with dishes then moved to our closet. Once I was walking past his nightstand I saw it was piled with trash inside and out. I will admit we had the rule that his nightstand can be as messy as he wants as long as I cannot see it. In this case it was spewing with trash. I figured cleaning it might help his mood as I know cluttered space makes me feel bad. So I start cleaning it out. I end up filling 3 mini trash bags. He walks in and sees me. He then needs to go through each bag of trash because I threw away room keys from all of our trips. Mind you these keys are covered in dirt and sticky stuff. I even opened a piece of paper and a white bug crawled out. He was livid at me for throwing out the cards. Then He found out I accidentally threw out a piece of cultural glass that his parents bought us that broke 2 years ago. In my defense it was wrapped in masks in the pile of trash in his drawer. But my bad I should have opened the masks. Thankfully he found the stuff. Now he\u2019s saying I have completely broken his trust and is going to drive to his parents 7 hours away. Thing is they aren\u2019t even there. That would also mean he\u2019s blowing off work tomorrow and his company just did 2 rounds of lay offs. I respectfully said I would appreciate if he stayed here and if he needed space he can go stay at his sisters tonight as she lives 15 minutes away. He said no he\u2019s going now to his parents house. I said I am feeling upset by that decision and he informed me it is not about me. I let him know this will severely affect our relationship if he just leaves for 7 days and blows off work in a time he should be there. I told him I\u2019m not sure our relationship can last if he leaves like this (low key for abandonment issues #adopted kid problems). I did apologize for going through his stuff and assured him I had good intentions. My impact just was not great. He said that he doesn\u2019t care I\u2019m sorry he cannot trust me. I let him know I am happy to not clean his drawer as long as trash is not spilling out of it. Like I found food in there it was gross. I\u2019m now sitting on the couch and convinced him to sleep here tonight as he does still want to maintain this relationship. It be a dumb reason to divorce but it\u2019s dunno how id do if he left. I have had a lot of people leave in my life I felt like him going to his parents house was him giving up on me and us. He did say I was being manipulative for feeling that way.

In order to make sure you will always be treated well in a relationship, you have to be prepared to leave if you are not treated well, and the only way you can genuinely be prepared to leave is when you can trust yourself to be okay no matter what happens.\n\nIf you husband had left, I think you would be okay just based on this post. Your instinct when something isn't great - your husband came home with a dark cloud which was affecting you too - was to make things better by cleaning up a space which, you are right, often contributes to how people feel.
