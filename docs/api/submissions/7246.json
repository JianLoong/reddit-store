Dan's elderly grandmother had been wanting a cat for a while (and preferred a specific breed) and finally got \"Prince\" in October 2021, but she began to have significant health problems very soon after. She entrusted\u00a0us with cat-sitting at first but when it became clearer her health would not improve, she clearly stated we were Prince's parents and gave us the proof of purchase, vaccination record, etc. I love animals in general and we totally adore Prince - the whole family does! Dan's grandmother passed away last June - very tough for everyone, especially as Dan's maternal side is tight-knit.\n\nDan's parents (my in-laws) live close by and have always had a cat. Unfortunately, their cat of 15 years died in October. Obviously very sad as we all adored him, too. If they hadn't had a cat at the time Prince became \"available,\" MIL & FIL would've been the natural choice to take Prince. However, the old cat was territorial and aggressive toward Prince, hence why they couldn't take him and why we were the next logical choice.\n\nOnto the problem: MIL has asked us if they could have Prince because they don't have a cat now, Prince is a sweet reminder of her late mother (Dan's grandmother), it's what late mother would've originally wanted, we didn't even have to pay for a purebred cat (no freaking clue why this matters), their house is much bigger and better suited for Prince vs. our city apartment... I've told Dan I think her\u00a0request\u00a0is beyond ridiculous, in much more unkind words. The context shouldn't matter and Prince is very much ours, not to mention he is not a stuffed animal that can just be passed around. In my mind, this is a non-starter and something that shouldn't have even been asked. Dan agrees but also knows his mom will not be happy and this will sour relationships. He thinks we might be AHs if we don't give Prince to my ILs, given the emotional state of MIL.\n\nMy judgment is clouded because I've never liked MIL(not pertinent to this situation, but I find her very annoying and ignorant, and it completely drains me to put on a polite face when I'm with her).

Keep the cat. Take your in-laws to a cat cafe or some shit and let them pick one of those that need a home. Just like you have prince a home when he needed it. He\u2019s your cat.", "NTA. Keep the cat and do NOT give him away. Employ every emotional tactic you need to: say he's important to you and you would be lost without him, explain that he would be frightened and confused to be rehomed after all this time. This cat is not a stuffed animal to be moved around as a memento.", "NTA\n\nIt would be traumatic to the cat to rehome him after this long a second time. We received our cat by chance as someone dropped her off in front of her house, and even though it's been 13 years she still gets incredibly anxious and clingy when we leave for more than a day to the point where it affects her physical health.", "NTA. Prince is YOUR cat. MIL can adopt another cat. Prince isn\u2019t a toy that can just be passed around. It can be immensely stressful for cats to even move let alone be rehomed. He deserves to have his forever home.", "NTA.\n\nHere's your perfect response: \"GM very clearly made us her cat's guardians.  Doing otherwise would be dishonoring her memory and wishes.  Everything else is irrelevant.\"", "Nta. Pets aren't stuffed toys you can pass around", "NTA. Prince is a purebred, right? I suspect that's why your MIL wants him. But he's a living thing and does not need the stress of changing environments twice in a row.", "NTA I mean, despite the circumstances, he\u2019s your cat. And it\u2019s probably not very good for Prince to be jumping from home to home. If he\u2019s happy and healthy with you guys, than that\u2019s what matters.", "NTA\n\nA cat is a living, feeling being and should not be treated like an accessory or piece of furniture and handed around. Changes in circumstances are emotionally upsetting to cats. I think this one's already been through enough.", "NTA\n\nPoor Prince has already been rehomed once, due to unfortunate circumstances.\n\nRehoming him again, after few months, it's likely to cause the cat stress.", "NTA. I can see why you might have a negative opinion of your MIL. I would not be a fan of anyone who thought it was okay to demand that I give them my pet! \n\nThat cat is yours. There are plenty of other cats out there (in many places, shelters are begging people to please adopt their cats), and if she wants to see Prince it's not like he's living with a stranger.", "NTA completely. \"Prince\" has settled with you, and it can be very distressing for them to keep getting passed from carer to carer which can result in some significant behavioural issues (one of mine went through numerous different homes before coming to me and is the clingiest creature I have ever met, always sleeping in my bed and being very much a needy lap cat. This behaviour got worse after I moved us in with my partner, to the point where he now follows me around the house and even sits in the bathroom when I'm having my tub time. When I come home from work he has to have lots of cuddle time before he settles down and stops crying out. We moved out here three years ago now and he still has not improved)", "NTA although MIL's emotional stuff makes it a little tricky.\n\nThe important thing is: What is best for the cat?\n\nSounds like you have a healthy relationship with Prince (Info: what breed? curious!) and it is not sodden with emotional detritus involving both previous cats and MIL's mother's death.\n\nGive Prince that home he needs and enjoy Life With Cat!\n\nETA: Plus, he's been with you for the better part of the year. This goes under \"What is best for the cat,\" above.", "NTA\n\nPrince already had to leave one owner and home, he shouldn't have to do it again. It's stressful on him and putting that type of strain all because your inlaws just want him is insane. The inlaws can go get a cat that genuinely needs a home.", "NTA. Unless Grannie specifically said something about if her daughter's cat died then she should take Prince or said to you she would've given Prince to her daughter but for her territorial cat, then no, you're entirely in the right. MIL can do one and respect her mother's wishes that you have the cat.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
