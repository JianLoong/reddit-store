Like a lot of people, I don\u2019t much care for confrontation, so hyping myself up I may have come off aggressive, asking that events be held at either her or my brothers house. I mentioned how we\u2019re always left with the clean up, and a lot of the financial burden. She completely shut down and refused to talk to me about it, and tbh I feel like a huge asshole. I feel like it\u2019s a completely reasonable request at its heart even if my delivery wasn\u2019t amazing. (Which I addressed and apologized for if I was coming off aggressive) I even said that I wouldn\u2019t be opposed to having MOST events at my house, but I feel like the current status quo isn\u2019t fair at all.

Your mom shut you down because she knows the family is 1) taking advantage of you and 2) wants to keep taking advantange of you.\n\nThe next time a family event comes up, say \"I'm sorry, we're just not able to host this time around'.", "NTA.\n\nBut just when you got a backbone, seems like you are back-pedaling already.", "NTA. If they won't at least help with the cleanup, you really don't have to put up with it. Guests with any class at all help with the cleanup before leaving. Just flat refuse to have the next event at your house, since your mother is being passive aggressive and refusing to discuss the issue.", "You\u2019ve been in this codependent family for so long that you aren\u2019t seeing how unreasonable THEY are being, and the fact that you even wonder if you might be in the wrong is very sad.  Your mother has you trained to always put her feelings first and be terrified of upsetting her. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to disappoint people, especially when it\u2019s not a super important issue (like health or safety). If they can\u2019t handle \u201cNo\u201d gracefully then they are the assholes.  Learning how to handle confrontation and stand up for yourself is a skill that is long overdue for you.  \n\nSend a text to your family saying \u201cWe can\u2019t host all of the family gatherings. It\u2019s too much. We can do [list events you\u2019re willing to host], but anything else will have to be elsewhere\u201d\n\nYou need to read this essay on guilt which I found on Reddit. \n\n_________\n\nFor the feelings of doubt and guilt you are experiencing: \nGuilt can be a helpful feeling when you\u2019ve wronged someone, because it helps you hopefully make better choices in the future and grow to be a better person. However there are times when guilt is what my therapist called \u201cinappropriate guilt\u201d, and that\u2019s when you feel guilty over things you don\u2019t need to, don\u2019t deserve to, or shouldn\u2019t ever feel guilty for. Oftentimes we feel this inappropriate guilt when others get upset over or strongly disagree with our choices/boundaries, especially if they also guilt trip us about it.\n\nI\u2019ve dealt with inappropriate guilt many times in my life before. My therapist recommended me to go through these questions and phrases when I\u2019m wondering if my guilt is \u201cappropriate\u201d or \u201cinappropriate\u201d guilt:\n\n* Why are you feeling guilty?\n* Did you actually do something wrong or cause real harm to the other person? (And no, them being inconvenienced or upset that they didn\u2019t get their way is NOT harm!)\n* Or did you do something innocuous (not harmful) that the other person just doesn\u2019t want you to do?\n* Does the other person have an ulterior motive for making you feel guilty?\n* Is the other person a reasonable, trustworthy person? Or do they have a history of manipulation, mooching, selfishness, guilt tripping, and/or cruel behavior?\n\nIf you did do wrong then apologize and make things right with the person you wronged/harmed.\n\nHowever if you didn\u2019t do anything wrong and they\u2019re guilt tripping you then reminding yourself of these phrases might help:\n\n* You\u2019re not responsible for other people\u2019s emotions or how they choose to react to your decisions. If your actions aren\u2019t harming anyone, yet someone else chooses to be upset over it anyways, then that\u2019s their choice to make- let them be upset!\n* You are not responsible for other people\u2019s (or their children\u2019s) mental, emotional, financial, or physical well-being. It\u2019s on them to take care of themselves and their dependents, not you.\n* It\u2019s ok to disagree with other people over your choices.\n* It\u2019s ok for other people to be upset over your choices.\n* It\u2019s ok to say \u201cno\u201d to something that harms or inconveniences you, or even if you just plain don\u2019t want to do it.\n* Just because someone is upset it doesn\u2019t automatically mean you did anything wrong. Sometimes people get upset just because they\u2019re not getting their way.\n* It\u2019s not your job to fix the situation or their emotions. Their emotions are their responsibility to manage.\n* Being a good person does not equal being a doormat! You can be a kind, generous person and set healthy boundaries, refuse to tolerate disrespect towards you/your loved ones, and not allow others to take advantage of you.\n* You matter too! Prioritizing your mental, emotional, financial, and physical well-being is important.\n* Don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. If helping them hurts you, then say no!", "NTA. She refuses to discuss it? Makes it kinda hard to negotiate new terms/conditions of hosting. The only thing to do is to stop. Until it\u2019s discussed as a family how to spread the responsibility. You are not being unreasonable to ask for a break or some help. End the free ride.", "You request was reasonable, but there was a phrase I've read on this sub that applies to your mom's attitude. I'm not sure of the wording but it was something like this:\n\n\"If nothing satisfies her, then she will get nothing\"\n\nShe is not interested in discussing the subject? Humor her. The subject is no longer up for discussion. No more family events until an acceptable rotation is agreed between the members of the whole family. All events at your place, all the time, is off the table until further notice.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Stop hosting these gatherings. You might have your family over for your kid's birthday, but you should not be hosting all the other get-togethers. It's just too bad if your mother does not like it. Your spouse might be willing to try talking some sense into her, but I don't think it will help.", "NTA. Considering how it affects your home and your family this is a perfectly reasonable boundary to set. She might be shocked due to the fact that this has been going on for years without you saying anything like this, but it feels like from the very beginning people weren\u2019t taking you, your family, your possessions, etc. into account with this arrangement.", "If your Mom won't talk about it I would put everything on hold with family events until this is resolved. It's really unfair to put all that responsibility on your and your wifes shoulders. We stopped hosting family get-togethers for that reason it became to expensive paying for everything. It was convenient having them at our house so we didn't have to get the kids ready and drive to someone else's place but the financial costs were too much. Finally, my wife just laid it on the line and explained it and now we all chip in to cover the costs and help out at whoever's house we are at to help clean up before leaving.", "NTA. It seems absolutely reasonable that the hosting duties rotate, or that everyone stay to clean up before the evening ends. I wouldn\u2019t host anything until an actual conversation takes place.", "NTA. And don\u2019t allow her shutting down to change your stance. What your mom is doing is a common way to emotionally manipulate people and honestly people do it without even consciously knowing they are attempting to manipulate people but it\u2019s just second nature to them if they are used to people bowing down to whatever they want. By shutting down and giving you the silent treatment she thinks that you will feel bad and eventually give in. Just remember you have nothing to feel bad for. You don\u2019t have to be rude, but if it comes up again just politely and in a friendly way state \u201cLike i\u2019ve said, my wife and I aren\u2019t comfortable taking on the burden of being the only people hosting and cleaning.
