Seems reasonable. You asked for help, and let them know ahead of time what would happen. Hopefully this next round of scheduling will be better for you. Perhaps give the supervisor your availability ahead of the schedule as well to make it very clear.", "NTA. \n\nCheck the employment rights in your state/country. Some countries have a set \"break time\" between the shifts, like for example there has to be a minimum 12 hour rest period between the end of one shift and beginign of the next.", "NTA. Your boss is two faced. Imagine complaining that you have him notice, but not his staff. That's his freaking job lmao, how lazy is he?", "I wouldn\u2019t feel bad. You reserve the right to have work/life balance. If your workplace is scheduling you to where you get off of work and barely have any time to relax or sleep before you have to get up again for work to to go back to it, this isn\u2019t healthy. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re in America, but this country is a nightmare when it comes to trying to have a life outside of work with most jobs. There is no work/life balance with a lot of these employers. Here, the consensus is that you must work yourself to death and have no time for yourself because a lot of corporations believe that your work is your life and if you aren\u2019t 100% dedicated to your job and aren\u2019t slaving away for the rest of your life for the company, you must not be cut out for the job, and they will crank you in and spit you out for someone else who they can turn into a mindless, robotic drone.\n\nMany employers are like this. If you don\u2019t get any time to recuperate from an exhausting shift, that\u2019s okay with them as long as they have bodies to fill the spot instead of hiring more people to accommodate those shifts.\n\nWe live in a world where work takes priority over our health. We live in a world where taking time for yourself means you are not a good employee and you have no dedication to your job. We work so hard to function in a society that expects us to be robots who are willing to go take whatever task is thrown at us, even if we are overworked and even if it costs us years of our lives in the future.\n\nWe live in a society that prioritizes the job over the importance of our health and our well-being.\n\nIt needs to change.\n\nDo what you need to do to protect yourself and the balance in your life and do not feel one bit guilty about it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Hospitals are notoriously inconsiderate and do not care about their employees wellbeing. You are just a number to them\u2014no one\u2019s going to look out for yourself like you do. So do what\u2019s best for you, and hope they understand!", "NTA\n\nAsking that you are not given a Day shift immediately after a Mid shift is a very reasonable request. The fact they couldn't be bothered to follow this guideline means they don't care about your feelings much if at all. You have no obligation to care more about them than they care about you, so using whatever tools you have available to improve your situation is fair game.", "NTA. You've been reasonable and approached this as well as you could have from a professional standpoint. You are standing up for what is right and what works best for your life/well-being. Keep doing that.", "NTA.  Tell them you received the following feedback from a parent who raised someone who would have been in your unit often.  I don't want anyone, no matter who it is, to be exhausted in that unit or other areas of the hospital.  Even admin mistakes can cost lives and your supervisors have no business creating a schedule that makes someone so tired that it raises the possibility of such tremendous mistake anywhere in the chain of service.  This is dangerous and shouldn't be tolerated.  It is up to them to make the correction where patients aren't affected.  I also wouldn't be surprised if they are breaking some health and hospital regulations here as well as with the scheduling (just guessing here).  You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. What a massive marinara flag. When someone shows you who they are, believe them. He fucked around and found out, and then was all surprised Pikachu face. But you know what? Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA \n\nIs there a policy about the length of time you should have between shifts? Either legally or a hospital policy. Might be worth looking into. In the UK we have to have 11 hours between shifts", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Under the previous supervisors, were the schedules reasonable for everyone?  If so, why didn\u2019t they just keep it the way it was?\n\nAlso, the company you work for is not your \u201cfamily\u201d.

It even happened to my sister (librarian) recently.  They want to take a perfectly good system and \u201crevamp\u201d it, just to flex that they are the ones in power now.  The irony is that it only loses people\u2019s respect for them", "NTA\n\nStay on the night shift. They are going to keep doing it deliberately", "Do you have an HR department? Because their scheduling is dangerous. NTA.", "NTA. Never feel guilty about advocating for yourself at work.", "Hey dude! NTA. Your supervisor sucks for not letting you sleep. I work in health care and you folks are GOLD. GOLD. They need to treat you better. Those nursing units can\u2019t run without you folks. It\u2019s a tough job!", "Nta", "NTA\n\nYou need to check with HR if they're shift patterns are legal. In the UK you need a minimum of 11 hour gap between shifts.", "Whoever is scheduling should allow for an employee to have sufficient sleep between shifts, that means a break long enough to include, in addition to 8 hours sleep, transportation home, meals, showering/grooming/hygiene, changing clothes, and transportation back to work. That should be a mandatory criteria when drawing up an employee schedule to avoid legal liability on the part of the hospital should a mistake be made with a patient's care, especially if that mistake was caused due to tiredness of the staff.\n\nSo no, OP does not have to draw up a personal availability for this jerk of a supervisor who's either incompetent or getting a kick out of screwing up his schedule on purpose. OP should cover his own back by escalating, in writing, the scheduling issue to a higher authority, highlighting the potential danger this supervisor is creating for the hospital."]}
