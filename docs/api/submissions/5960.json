Seems reasonable. You asked for help, and let them know ahead of time what would happen. Hopefully this next round of scheduling will be better for you. Perhaps give the supervisor your availability ahead of the schedule as well to make it very clear.", "NTA. \n\nCheck the employment rights in your state/country. Some countries have a set \"break time\" between the shifts, like for example there has to be a minimum 12 hour rest period between the end of one shift and beginign of the next.", "NTA. Your boss is two faced. Imagine complaining that you have him notice, but not his staff. That's his freaking job lmao, how lazy is he?", "I wouldn\u2019t feel bad. You reserve the right to have work/life balance. If your workplace is scheduling you to where you get off of work and barely have any time to relax or sleep before you have to get up again for work to to go back to it, this isn\u2019t healthy. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re in America, but this country is a nightmare when it comes to trying to have a life outside of work with most jobs. There is no work/life balance with a lot of these employers. Here, the consensus is that you must work yourself to death and have no time for yourself because a lot of corporations believe that your work is your life and if you aren\u2019t 100% dedicated to your job and aren\u2019t slaving away for the rest of your life for the company, you must not be cut out for the job, and they will crank you in and spit you out for someone else who they can turn into a mindless, robotic drone.\n\nMany employers are like this. If you don\u2019t get any time to recuperate from an exhausting shift, that\u2019s okay with them as long as they have bodies to fill the spot instead of hiring more people to accommodate those shifts.\n\nWe live in a world where work takes priority over our health. We live in a world where taking time for yourself means you are not a good employee and you have no dedication to your job. We work so hard to function in a society that expects us to be robots who are willing to go take whatever task is thrown at us, even if we are overworked and even if it costs us years of our lives in the future.\n\nWe live in a society that prioritizes the job over the importance of our health and our well-being.\n\nIt needs to change.\n\nDo what you need to do to protect yourself and the balance in your life and do not feel one bit guilty about it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

So do what\u2019s best for you, and hope they understand!", "NTA\n\nAsking that you are not given a Day shift immediately after a Mid shift is a very reasonable request. The fact they couldn't be bothered to follow this guideline means they don't care about your feelings much if at all. You have no obligation to care more about them than they care about you, so using whatever tools you have available to improve your situation is fair game.", "NTA. You've been reasonable and approached this as well as you could have from a professional standpoint. You are standing up for what is right and what works best for your life/well-being. Keep doing that.", "NTA.  Tell them you received the following feedback from a parent who raised someone who would have been in your unit often.  I don't want anyone, no matter who it is, to be exhausted in that unit or other areas of the hospital.  Even admin mistakes can cost lives and your supervisors have no business creating a schedule that makes someone so tired that it raises the possibility of such tremendous mistake anywhere in the chain of service.  This is dangerous and shouldn't be tolerated.  It is up to them to make the correction where patients aren't affected.  I also wouldn't be surprised if they are breaking some health and hospital regulations here as well as with the scheduling (just guessing here).  You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. What a massive marinara flag. When someone shows you who they are, believe them. He fucked around and found out, and then was all surprised Pikachu face. But you know what? Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA \n\nIs there a policy about the length of time you should have between shifts? Either legally or a hospital policy. Might be worth looking into.

That should be a mandatory criteria when drawing up an employee schedule to avoid legal liability on the part of the hospital should a mistake be made with a patient's care, especially if that mistake was caused due to tiredness of the staff.\n\nSo no, OP does not have to draw up a personal availability for this jerk of a supervisor who's either incompetent or getting a kick out of screwing up his schedule on purpose. OP should cover his own back by escalating, in writing, the scheduling issue to a higher authority, highlighting the potential danger this supervisor is creating for the hospital.", "NTA in the UK that schedule would be illegal.", "NTA \n\nbut also not unusual in the medical community. Here\u2019s the deal. You have to look out for yourself first because no one else will. You can\u2019t take care of others if you don\u2019t take care of yourself first. It took me working in the health field for many years before I realized this. Now, I not only embrace this but when I orient people I try and really encourage them to do the same. I think one of the things that convinced me was when I went to work for a department that took care of their own. We took breaks including meal breaks. We did self scheduling and we traded for each other to support our needs including getting to kids things or just having an appt for hair cut! We were happy and our turnover was really low. It\u2019s not a surprise that the dept you work in is short staffed because of how the staff is treated. \n\nI would suggest to you that they probably aren\u2019t going to change things any time soon so if you like this type of work look for openings in another area. You will get push back so I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone you are applying until after you interview and you accept the job. There absolutely are \u201csweet spots\u201d at a hospital to work in.

You can do this!", "NTA, that's bad management not anything you've done wrong.", "Isn't it illegal for them to assign back to back shifts with only 4 hours in between?", "It sounds like you have shit schedulers making your schedule without consideration nor understanding the tolls bad management can have on everyone as an organization. If you can stick it out do, otherwise start looking for a place which can meet your natural, human, mental plus emotional needs. \nNTAH. \nAn employer that over works their work force is handling suicidal cases awaiting to happen. Unless the suicidal possible case walks out for their own good and abandons their shit employer suicidal ideations will manifest. I am glad you haven't gotten to the stage where you feel/ understand it's all worthless. \nI suggest you keep a journal, to understand yourself and the feelings you get day in and day out. Then go back and read it. You are asking for advice for what you shouldn't here. Putting yourself and your wellbeing will never make you an asshole, but your employer is trying to make you think just that from what you have shared. You work for a shit place.\nKnow when your naivety is being taken advantage of because you are naive, and believe in what you have to offer to help an over all organization. \nBe well and happy. Now I just want to know what makes you happy, and what helps you destress and keep you wholesome and full. If you can, cut back your work hours... you need it, and you need a vacation.

But I had 8/9 hours in between those shifts. I could only get 4 hours sleep at max during those shifts", "This. There are legal requirements that you must have at least 8 hours in between your shifts in most places, and at least for certain in Ontario. When i worked at my local hospital through the pandemic I could not work a 3-11 and then come in 5-1. I could not work 11PM-7AM and then work 1-9. I could not extend a night shift past a certain time if we were short and needed coverage because when you\u2019re tired you make mistakes and people can die. If you forget to put a note in a chart, or miss a visitor walking in who needs to prove their approved for entrance and sign the log book for contact tracing, you risk infecting a whole unit with the plague.

It\u2019s 8 hours usually", "When I was full time we always had a line of the same shift for a week. The shifts would rotate but you were always the same shift with two days off and then you could switch to another. The only time you short changed (what we called a break of less than 12 hours) was if you traded a shift with someone, or you got called in. So you could schedule yourself for a short change, but the manager could not schedule you for a short change.", "I did 12-hour shifts for 5 years. The best part of that workplace is that the schedule was organised so that you were always starting your week with the day shift, and ending on night shifts. And after your night shifts you'd have a few days off to get back to a normal schedule (unless you were called in for OT). It was a really good way to limit the negative impacts of rotating shifts.\n\nOnly exception was one monthly meeting where someone's night shift would be split: finish at midnight, get back in again for 9/10 for a 2-3 hr meeting.", "Yes, those who worked 12 hours (I\u2019ve extended my shifts before, but I mean primarily nurses) were on a rotation. You did so many days, had at least one if not two days off to switch yourself to night shift, you worked nights for so many days, and then you had two or more days to change yourself back to days. I always found it was easier to switch to nights than it was to days because the first night you get off you suck down caffiene before you leave, stay up until 3-5 scrolling reddit/binging tv, sleep, most of the day, and then get up for your night shift that night. Switching from nights to days was a biiiiiiitch though.", "Yeah, 4am alarms hit so badly on that first day shift. Particularly if you tried to get to bed for 9pm and your brain spun till 1am...", "If I was switching to 5-1s I would set an early alarm the day morning before I switched, smoke an inordinate amount of marijuana and be in bed by 6PM because then I\u2019d be tired enough to go to bed before the sun had set, lmao!", "Odd schedules like that cause sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation causes deaths.", "NTA. If they want to do insane scheduling with crap turnarounds, they need to be prepared for more folks to jump shifts.", "I also work in a hospital and the rules are you must have 8 hours in between shifts. Our shifts are 7a-7p and 7p-7a, with the mid shift being 10a-10p. I\u2019ve seen nurse leave at 10pm and come back at 7 am with no problem, as that\u2019s 9 hours.\n\nNTA OP, there are probably rules against what they\u2019re doing.", "I schedule people in my job, and we can't break the 8-hour-turnaround rule, but I don't even like to give people a turnaround of less than 10-12 hours if I can help it - and nearly everyone I schedule works from home!"]}
