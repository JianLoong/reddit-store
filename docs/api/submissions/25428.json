I included (not full fat, sorry that wasn't clear) sour cream inside so there was NO REASON WHAT SO FUCKING EVER to add more. EVERY SINGLE PERSON understood this without needing it spelled out. Except her.

She ended up getting sick and ruining the rest of the evening for everyone by laying on the couch and whining and moaning about her dumping syndrome or whatever it is. At that point, I just decided that I would never invite her over again.\n\nThis past weekend, I invited the family over. Except her. I didn\u2019t tell her, and asked no one else tell her.

I told her that my childhood obesity was HER doing, SHE was the reason I was 200lbs as an 8th grader, SHE was the reason I STILL need to weigh portions because my instinct is to overeat. SHE is the reason I was a fat teenager that EVERYONE made fun of and no boys EVER liked. That it wasn't until I MOVED OUT and got AWAY that I could learn how to take care of myself.\n\nShe did all the \u201chow could you say those things to me\u201d nonsense and got really emotional, blah blah why do you hate me. I told her I don\u2019t hate her, but I absolutely hate the fact that my ENTIRE LIFE has been all about having to take care of a fucking adult woman who has no fucking self control and undo all the damage she caused.\n\nShe left, we finished dinner, and she wrote me a long ass email telling me how insensitive and cruel I am to have aired that all around everyone in the family. Everyone who already knows exactly who she is. My husband supports me 100% but has told me that I might need to try to mend the fence with her or our relationship will never recover.
