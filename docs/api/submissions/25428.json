{"id": 25428, "submission_id": "160ab7n", "title": "AITA for not inviting my mom to family dinner and yelling at her in front of everyone when she showed up?", "selftext": "My mom had weight loss surgery in 2002 but she never dealt with the reasons for her obesity and overeating. There are a lot of foods she can\u2019t eat, including full fat dairy, because she will get sick. It\u2019s been 20 years and she KNOWS she can\u2019t eat these things, she KNOWS she can\u2019t eat a full meal at restaurants, and she still insists on ordering things she can\u2019t eat.\n\nA few months ago, I made enchiladas for dinner for the family. I included (not full fat, sorry that wasn't clear) sour cream inside so there was NO REASON WHAT SO FUCKING EVER to add more. EVERY SINGLE PERSON understood this without needing it spelled out. Except her. She INSISTED on pouring it all over DESPITE KNOWING IT WOULD MAKE HER SICK.\n\nI told her \u201cIf you do that, you will get sick.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just how I like to eat this\u201d\n\nSo she ate them. She ended up getting sick and ruining the rest of the evening for everyone by laying on the couch and whining and moaning about her dumping syndrome or whatever it is. At that point, I just decided that I would never invite her over again.\n\nThis past weekend, I invited the family over. Except her. I didn\u2019t tell her, and asked no one else tell her. Of course one of my nieces did. And so when we were all seated, enjoying a nice meal, mom pulls up and asks why I didn\u2019t invite her.\n\nI said that I am sick and tired of her ruining every single meal because she insists on eating things that she can\u2019t and that I am DONE. I pushed it further and told her that 20 years ago she had the ability to change her life with that surgery, but instead she didn\u2019t bother to actually address the reasons for her overeating, and she wasted everyone\u2019s time and effort on her by ballooning back up to morbid obesity because she was too fucking lazy to learn how to take care of herself. I told her that my childhood obesity was HER doing, SHE was the reason I was 200lbs as an 8th grader, SHE was the reason I STILL need to weigh portions because my instinct is to overeat. SHE is the reason I was a fat teenager that EVERYONE made fun of and no boys EVER liked. That it wasn't until I MOVED OUT and got AWAY that I could learn how to take care of myself.\n\nShe did all the \u201chow could you say those things to me\u201d nonsense and got really emotional, blah blah why do you hate me. I told her I don\u2019t hate her, but I absolutely hate the fact that my ENTIRE LIFE has been all about having to take care of a fucking adult woman who has no fucking self control and undo all the damage she caused.\n\nShe left, we finished dinner, and she wrote me a long ass email telling me how insensitive and cruel I am to have aired that all around everyone in the family. Everyone who already knows exactly who she is. My husband supports me 100% but has told me that I might need to try to mend the fence with her or our relationship will never recover.

She forced the issue by showing up and confronting you in front of everyone, who, like you wrote, understands exactly what is and has gone on.  \n\nThat said, if you have the energy and when you're ready, do what you can to mend fences.  You can be sorry that it embarrassed her, but NOT sorry that you spoke your truth.  She needs to understand her issues have bled over to others and it's not just about her.  She also needs to understand your frustration that she has refused to constructively help herself.", "NTA and good for you!", "god no...

I'm so sorry your mother did this to you growing up.  I hope you are healthier now and happy with yourself.  If you don't want to talk to your mother, then you're good. If you do want to still have your mom in your life, you may need to talk to her and explain your point of view calmly, and how it's very upsetting watching her harm herself with food.", "Important question to ask yourself here... Do you WANT to mend this relationship?", "So do you want to have a relationship with your mom going forward or not? Because if you do, your husband is right, this was not constructive. If you don't, fine. This was harsh but realistic.\n\nOverall I don't think you helped anything - whether that's your mom, her relationship with food, or your relationship with her. So I'm not sure what your goal was other than airing your grievances but NAH.", "NTA", "I'd slap that damn niece hard.", "ESH I suggest you get some counseling for that anger you're hanging on to.

Not dealing with issues.....", "Have you ever tried cooking a meal she can safely eat?", "NAH You are allowed to feel how you feel to your mom and invite whoever you want to a dinner party, and she is allowed to be hurt by your response.

Show her a little empathy and grace, too, it will feel good.", "INFO: Does your mom bring her own sour cream?

How would you feel if there was a secret family dinner and when you turned up a close family member unloaded 20 years of trauma on you? \n\nTalking with her beforehand and letting her know she isn\u2019t invited to future meals because of her behaviour would have been the honest way to address it.\n\nYTA for your behaviour I\u2019m afraid.

You don\u2019t have to feed her or include her in meals. The fact that she\u2019s intentionally eating trigger foods or overeating is a massive red flag. The good news?

I don't know about her upbringing or about her traumas, but I'm pretty sure she is not the way she is for fun.
