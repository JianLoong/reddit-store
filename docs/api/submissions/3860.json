Yesterday i made a post about my egg donor showing up after 7 years of radio silence demanding that i start college funds for ger 4 offsprings. (post got deleted by the mods if you haven't seen it i will send it to you)\n\nShe got a hold of my brother and i don't know how but she got him on her side and now he's pressing me to \"be rational\" and agree to start those college funds. He says that even if he's still mad at her for abandoning us he thinks she deserves a second chance and we should try to make amends with her.\n\nI told him there's no way in hell I'm going to do that and that she's only back because she thinks she can get some money. I showed him the messages were she said that if we want any relationship with her and the kids I have to pay.\n\nHe was understanding of my fear of being just an ATM but said it won't hurt me to help them out.\n\nI straight up told him if he brings this subject up one more time i will stop all financial support. This includes not just jus tuition but also living expenses since he lives with me for free.\n\nHe started complaining that he's school schedule doesn't allow him to get a job so if i stop helping him he'll hace to quit college. I told even even tho he is right if that happens it will only be his fault for pressing this issue.\n\nMy grandma said that even tho she agrees that I'm not obligated to financially provide for him and i am right to be mad at him for asking me to indulge my egg donor' request, i should have found another way of approaching the issue without bringing up his school. \n\nI know i can get pretty harsh when I'm mad and I'm sure i could've done better but AITA for involving his education?\n\nUPDATE:\nSomeone suggested seeking professional help wich i did, i talked with a therapist and she said that my brother most likely never got over the abandonment and is now seeing this as a second chance to have his mom back. I talked with him and i explain all the reasons why that woman and her kids will never receive anything from me. I again showed him the messages were she demanded money if we want to meet the kids. I also apologize for my behavior because i took my anger out on him and it wasn't fair however i also reminded him that i worked my ass off for what i have and no one has a right on my money. I'm helping him out because i want him to have the possibility of getting a degree that will get him a good job but that's only because of our relationship. A relationship that we've been building our entire lives. A relationship based on love, trust, memories, bonding, helping each other, being there when se need each other and this is not a relationship I'm going to have with those kids. He said he understands and apologized for trying to pressure me but he said that our relationship will never be the same because I'm the reason he can't have his mom. So the therapist was right but I'm not gonna lie it hurts. I told him he can have a relationship with her if he wants but he repeated that he can't because of me. I suggest he starts therapy but that back fired because I'm trying to take him away from his mom. Idk how to deal with this. I talked to grandma and she started crying. Now i feel like an bitch for upsetting her. \n\nThe thing is i can't force him to get help if he doesn't want to be helped and these issues will probably get worse. He left and is staying with a friend because he can't stand being around me. So I'm crying, grandma is crying and my brother refuses to speak with either of us.\n\nThis is just great. Tomorrow I'm meeting with a lawyer like many of the comments on my first post suggested to make sure in case something happens my egg donor will get nothing. I'm a mess.\nMy brother hates me and at 22 i need to right my will. I shouldn't have to deal with this shit. \n\nOn another note my boss told me to take a week of paid leave after i started crying hysterically in his office when he asked if i was ok. Bless his soul.

However, involving your brother's education in your argument is not an appropriate way to handle the situation. Threatening to cut off his financial support and potentially causing him to quit college is a form of emotional manipulation and is not fair to him. It may be helpful to have a calm and respectful conversation with your brother about your concerns and boundaries, without using his education as leverage. It may also be helpful to seek the advice of a therapist or mediator to help you navigate this difficult situation and find a resolution that is fair to all parties involved. In this situation, you are not the asshole for standing up for yourself and setting boundaries, but you are the asshole for using your brother's education as a means to manipulate him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The only people who can decide if he has a relationship with his mother is him and his mother. After everything you and your grandmother have done for him, I personally find it disgusting that he would demand so much more. Frankly, your mother did not care a single iota about either of you for two whole decades. She still doesn't. She wants money. That's it. That's the only reason she's here. Your brother is being very naive to think that once you start giving her money, she'll love him and care for him. Quite evidently, the both of you are nothing but a blank check. She wants college funds, and once she has that she'll want the vacation money, the grocery money, the clothes money, the house money, et cetera, et cetera, ad infinitum. And every time you try to draw the line, she can just say, pay it or we won't have a relationship. Every single time. And you're going to end up ruining your life for people you've now met, what, twice? Your brother is far, far too entitled to your money. You don't owe him a college fund either, or a place to stay, or anything like that. He doesn't need it.

You owe her (and technically your brother, either) nothing. You are supporting him out of the goodness of your heart. If he can't accept that, it's his loss.

A little back story. My mom had me at 14 and didn't know who my father was. She was partying, sleeping around and using illegal substances. My grandma took care of me because my mom never intended to be a mom. When i was 2 my mom got pregnant again and the guy she was seeing wanted nothing to do with the baby. Grandma had told my mom that she since she doesn't care about school (she was failed most of her classes) then she either starts taking care of her kids or gets a job . My mom promised she'll do better at school so grandma agreed to keep raising us only if my mom won't have any more kids. \n\nWhen i was 15 she got pregnant again and grandma kicked her out but let me and my brother stay. We never heard from her again.\n\nI studied very hard and got into college with a full scholarship wich got me good room in the dorms. I had about 12k saved wich i used for food and extras. After the first semester thanks to my grades i got a paid (about 5k) internship at my dream job. Since i graduated my paycheck doubled and after 4 months i got a promotion that added another 6k to my paycheck. \n\nMy mom is suddenly back. She found my Instagram and saw that i travel frequently and that i own a 45k. Last weekend i went home and mom was there with 4 kids. Apparently she got married and had 3 more kids in the last 4 years.\n\n To cut the story short my mom wants me to start college funds for the other 4 kids because there my siblings and it's not fair that I'm helping my brother with his college expensise but not them. \n\nI got really angry i told her that she's not my mom and they're not my siblings and that she's an idiot if she thinks i will give her a dollar after 7 years of radio silence.\n\nGrandma and my brother are on my side but some friends say I'm not fair because she is still my mom even if she's a bad mom and that my siblings are my siblings even tho I've never met them.
