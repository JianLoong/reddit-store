Okay so my (25f) best friend (25f) recently got married. We\u2019ve been friends since we were freshmen in high school and I genuinely consider her to be like a sister. With us being friends for so long, of course we planned our weddings out years in advance. We made an agreement to be each other\u2019s MOH at our weddings a long time ago. So when she got engaged, of course she asked me to be her MOH. I said yes. However, when she told me the dates for everything such as her wedding dress shopping, fitting, and food, I let her know I would not be able to make certain dates as I started a new job not too long ago and didn\u2019t have any PTO in order to be there. I knew ahead of time because I work overnight and my job has a schedule that shows everyday I\u2019m scheduled to work for the entire year. She was fine with that, as long as I could attend the bachelorette party and the wedding, which I could. However, when the night came for the bachelorette party, I found out that someone else was her MOH and she didn\u2019t even tell me herself. One of our other friends, who was a bridesmaid, just so happened to call the other girl (who I thought was a bridesmaid) the MOH and I realized that I had been booted out. By then it was too close to the wedding date for me to purchase a bridesmaid dress. So she asked me to be her ring bearer instead. The little boy she originally had on the program to do it was no longer able be the ring bearer and since she had a flower man, she thought a female ring bearer would be a great match. Because she\u2019s my best friend, and because I knew she was under stress and I didn\u2019t want to add to it, I said yes to make her happy. I don\u2019t know how many people have been apart of a wedding but you normally take a good portion of the pictures before the ceremony. So of course the photographer and videographer begin and when one of them sees me standing off to the side, he tells me to get in. I refused and said \u201coh no I\u2019m not a bridesmaid.\u201d Anytime the photographer asked for a picture of the bridesmaids, and told me to get in it, I was sure to correct him and let them know I wasn\u2019t a bridesmaid. Most of the guests at the wedding know that she and I and best friends so they were really surprised that I wasn\u2019t the MOH or even a bridesmaid for that matter. I could tell she didn\u2019t like that I kept saying I wasn\u2019t one but I wanted her to really see how she had cut me out of her wedding. I wanted her to get her pictures back and I barely wanted to be in any of them. Now that that wedding is over, I realized that our friendship just doesn\u2019t feel the same. We don\u2019t talk as much and things just feel awkward and I think it\u2019s because I haven\u2019t gotten over the feeling of betrayal. But I also think it\u2019s because she knows she did me wrong. I even let her know how I felt and we talked about it. But I still feel some type of way about it and was wondering if the asshole or if I even have the right to be upset since I missed key parts leading up to the wedding?\n\nEdit #1. I keep seeing this question about the dress. People keep thinking I didn\u2019t have a dress at all. I had a dress but it wasn\u2019t the same as all the other girls. She asked me to have a different one then everyone else because she wanted the MOH to have a different dress. So when I was no longer the maid of honor, I didn\u2019t have a bridesmaid dress because she told me not to get it.", "created_utc": 1674386907, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ihlwa/aita_for_repeatedly_letting_everyone_know_im_not/", "score": 392, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She decided you were no longer the MOH and didn't even tell you. You went from MOH to not even in the wedding party. And it's not because you couldn't attend certain events leading to the wedding, because you had told her that initially and she said it was fine. That was such a dick move on her part. Who does something like that to their supposed best friend? You have every right to be upset. SHE should have been the one to tell you, not someone else saying some random comment at one of the events that you overheard.   \n\n\nAnd, of course, if people are assuming you're in the bridal party and they are pushing you to take pictures and asking you about being in the bridal party, etc, it's perfectly okay to set the record straight. It probably cut you every time that someone mentioned it. And so what if part of your intention was for her to hear it? What she did was shady and if she feels upset hearing about her choices, then maybe she should have made different ones and been a better friend in the situation.", "NTA. You weren't a bridesmaid or MOH. She didn't even tell you till the last minute. You didn't need to be in photos that were for those titles. Sounds like you have both outgrown this friendship.

Your so call best friend would rather make sure everyone get their way rather then sticking up for you. Especially someone who she so called best friend.

The fact that she would let her actual best friend be booted out of the wedding, like she didn't even get you a gift, while someone else pushed herself up to maid of honor- either she is completely spineless and has some serious issues, or there is more going on that she didn't tell you the first time.

You two need to talk and clear the air instead of pretending that nothing has changed. My best friend. (more like a sister) which I have known since we were 16 (we are now 44) got married last year.

We did everything online (when she was trying dresses she took pictures and ask me what I thought), I helped her looking for things online, planned the entertainment... Flew a week early to help her with all the finishing touches... My point is that you could have found a way, certainly she should have told you, you were not her MOH anymore, and of course as soon as she knew you would not be, then you should have had enough time to get a matching dress. She could have also asked you to be her witness (which I was for my best friend). When the photographer asked the first time it was more than ok to say that you were not a bridesmaid, after that if you could have taken a photo, however I clearly get that you were feeling hurt. You need to clear the air, it might also be that you are also simply growing apart.", "Your friend should have told you as soon as she decided you were no longer MOH, and for that she\u2019s the AH here.

She is the reason you weren't MOH or a bridesmaid, so it's her own fault if she doesn't like you telling people you aren't. Seriously, what did she expect? For you to just act like you were?

She may have been yours but you were not hers.  At any time you can call a best friend and share your private thoughts - she didn\u2019t even tell you you had been replaced.

Any reasonable employer would understand being MOH in a wedding. You aren\u2019t taking time off to goof around, it\u2019s a major event. Did you even ask? Given enough notice your employer could have helped you rearrange your schedule, find a sub or delegate tasks. \n\nI think this started with the bride feeling that you didn\u2019t really try to be her MOH. It\u2019s not just wearing a dress and being at the head of the line on the day of. When your best friend wanted to talk or share her plans were you too busy with your new job? Did you reach out to her in your free time to ask how things were going? Did you consider going to spend time with her on your days off? Face time in if you couldn\u2019t be at the shower or dress fitting etc.? Had you already drifted apart prior to any of this? I think your bf felt that you didn\u2019t make her a priority during one of the most important events of her life. \n\nHow she handled it was 100% an AH move. You did not deserve to have your \u2018demotion\u2019 sprung on you like that at the same time it didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. Two things can be true at the same time. She was a bitch to you and humiliated you which you Did Not deserve and possibly you neglected your friendship.", "Yta.

You were not a MOH (because your friend decided so). It's not like you were lying.

In Ops words, first she accepted to be the ring bearer, to avoid adding stress on her friend and making her happy,  while on the day of the wedding purposely kept saying she wasn't a bridesmaid and avoided to be in the pictures, in order to create a permanent reminder to her friend for the affront perceived. And this after she was offered the part of the ring bearer, making her a part of the ceremony. No wonder the bride is keeping a distance from Op. \n\n\"I could tell she didn\u2019t like that I kept saying I wasn\u2019t one but I wanted her to really see how she had cut me out of her wedding.

Sorry this sounds pretty heartbreaking.", "Honestly, it\u2019s sounds like ESH. She\u2019s totally an AH for not telling you about the switch. She was a coward. No excuses. But, I\u2019ve been the MOH for 2 of my best friends\u2019 weddings. It\u2019s a lot of f*-ing work, *time*, and money. I would have been pissed if either of my best friends chose someone else to have the title\u2026but I was the one performing all of the activities that the MOH traditionally performs.

You are because your pettiness was uncalled for.", "ESH...

Years of friendship and you make her day about you.", "NAH It honestly sounds like a miscommunication to me. I can imagine that when you told her you couldn\u2019t do those dates, she took that as you saying you couldn\u2019t fulfil MOH/bridesmaid duties and were stepping down, even if that\u2019s not what you meant.", "INFO: who planned the bachelorette party?

If it's something like that, I would give her a pass, but yeah, any other job she should have tried more to get time off.", "My best friend let another friend be maid of honor for that reason too!

I'd also let her family know you are doing so.\n\nIts time to let this friendship go. Its not about the MOH position. Its about lying to you, embarrassing you, allowing you to spend a metric ton of money under false pretenses. Quite honestly, I'd tell her that since she never intended for you to be her MOH you expect full reimbursement for all expenses that should have been the job of her wedding party, including her bachelorette party and your dress.
