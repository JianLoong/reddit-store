Okay so my (25f) best friend (25f) recently got married. We\u2019ve been friends since we were freshmen in high school and I genuinely consider her to be like a sister. With us being friends for so long, of course we planned our weddings out years in advance. We made an agreement to be each other\u2019s MOH at our weddings a long time ago. So when she got engaged, of course she asked me to be her MOH. I said yes. However, when she told me the dates for everything such as her wedding dress shopping, fitting, and food, I let her know I would not be able to make certain dates as I started a new job not too long ago and didn\u2019t have any PTO in order to be there. I knew ahead of time because I work overnight and my job has a schedule that shows everyday I\u2019m scheduled to work for the entire year. She was fine with that, as long as I could attend the bachelorette party and the wedding, which I could. However, when the night came for the bachelorette party, I found out that someone else was her MOH and she didn\u2019t even tell me herself. One of our other friends, who was a bridesmaid, just so happened to call the other girl (who I thought was a bridesmaid) the MOH and I realized that I had been booted out. By then it was too close to the wedding date for me to purchase a bridesmaid dress. So she asked me to be her ring bearer instead. The little boy she originally had on the program to do it was no longer able be the ring bearer and since she had a flower man, she thought a female ring bearer would be a great match. Because she\u2019s my best friend, and because I knew she was under stress and I didn\u2019t want to add to it, I said yes to make her happy. I don\u2019t know how many people have been apart of a wedding but you normally take a good portion of the pictures before the ceremony. So of course the photographer and videographer begin and when one of them sees me standing off to the side, he tells me to get in. I refused and said \u201coh no I\u2019m not a bridesmaid.\u201d Anytime the photographer asked for a picture of the bridesmaids, and told me to get in it, I was sure to correct him and let them know I wasn\u2019t a bridesmaid. Most of the guests at the wedding know that she and I and best friends so they were really surprised that I wasn\u2019t the MOH or even a bridesmaid for that matter. I could tell she didn\u2019t like that I kept saying I wasn\u2019t one but I wanted her to really see how she had cut me out of her wedding. I wanted her to get her pictures back and I barely wanted to be in any of them. Now that that wedding is over, I realized that our friendship just doesn\u2019t feel the same. We don\u2019t talk as much and things just feel awkward and I think it\u2019s because I haven\u2019t gotten over the feeling of betrayal. But I also think it\u2019s because she knows she did me wrong. I even let her know how I felt and we talked about it. But I still feel some type of way about it and was wondering if the asshole or if I even have the right to be upset since I missed key parts leading up to the wedding?\n\nEdit #1. I keep seeing this question about the dress. People keep thinking I didn\u2019t have a dress at all. I had a dress but it wasn\u2019t the same as all the other girls. She asked me to have a different one then everyone else because she wanted the MOH to have a different dress. So when I was no longer the maid of honor, I didn\u2019t have a bridesmaid dress because she told me not to get it.", "created_utc": 1674386907, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ihlwa/aita_for_repeatedly_letting_everyone_know_im_not/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She decided you were no longer the MOH and didn't even tell you. You went from MOH to not even in the wedding party. And it's not because you couldn't attend certain events leading to the wedding, because you had told her that initially and she said it was fine. That was such a dick move on her part. Who does something like that to their supposed best friend? You have every right to be upset. SHE should have been the one to tell you, not someone else saying some random comment at one of the events that you overheard.   \n\n\nAnd, of course, if people are assuming you're in the bridal party and they are pushing you to take pictures and asking you about being in the bridal party, etc, it's perfectly okay to set the record straight. It probably cut you every time that someone mentioned it. And so what if part of your intention was for her to hear it? What she did was shady and if she feels upset hearing about her choices, then maybe she should have made different ones and been a better friend in the situation.", "NTA. You weren't a bridesmaid or MOH. She didn't even tell you till the last minute. You didn't need to be in photos that were for those titles. Sounds like you have both outgrown this friendship. That's okay. It'll hurt for a bit, but friends don't treat each other as afterthoughts.", "I mean what were you to do?\n\n\nYour 'friend' booted you out as MOH and gave you a token position of ring bearer, IMO I would have told her no and asked what had happened to being MOH.\n\nNTA", "NTA reading your other comment, just want to let you know, whatever happened it\u2019s not your fault. Your so call best friend would rather make sure everyone get their way rather then sticking up for you. Especially someone who she so called best friend. The disrespect.", "NTA, this is wild, you should have a repeat conversation with her even if it makes her feel uncomfortable. The fact that she would let her actual best friend be booted out of the wedding, like she didn't even get you a gift, while someone else pushed herself up to maid of honor- either she is completely spineless and has some serious issues, or there is more going on that she didn't tell you the first time.

You two need to talk and clear the air instead of pretending that nothing has changed. My best friend. (more like a sister) which I have known since we were 16 (we are now 44) got married last year. She lives in France and I live in England. I was still her made of honour. We did everything online (when she was trying dresses she took pictures and ask me what I thought), I helped her looking for things online, planned the entertainment... Flew a week early to help her with all the finishing touches... My point is that you could have found a way, certainly she should have told you, you were not her MOH anymore, and of course as soon as she knew you would not be, then you should have had enough time to get a matching dress. She could have also asked you to be her witness (which I was for my best friend). When the photographer asked the first time it was more than ok to say that you were not a bridesmaid, after that if you could have taken a photo, however I clearly get that you were feeling hurt. You need to clear the air, it might also be that you are also simply growing apart.", "Your friend should have told you as soon as she decided you were no longer MOH, and for that she\u2019s the AH here. The level of AH depends on whether she simply forgot to tell you in all the stress and busyness of planning her wedding, and how she handled it when the truth came out.\n\nWhat did she say to you when you finally found out at the bachelorette party? You talk about her deciding to make you ring bearer instead of bridesmaid; so you must have had a conversation then. How did she handle it? Was she apologetic at all? \n\nYou are NTA.

How do you move forward from this and do you still make her your MOH when it's your turn? She broke your pact so.", "NTA, but a little bit clueless.\n\nIf you and this girl are so close, why did she:\n\n1) Let you plan a Bachelorette party she never intended on going to\n\n2) Not tell you you had been replaced until it was too late and basically booted you from the bridal party\n\n3) Not get you the same gift the rest of the bridal party got\n\n4) Not even speak to you after the fact until you brought it up, after which as you said: \"things are different now\"\n\nYou clearly think a lot more of her than she does of you.
