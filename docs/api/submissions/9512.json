If you see that something is very important to the person you love or that it's something they're taking very seriously, don't add an unauthorized prank. This shouldn't have to be explained to a 31-year-old. Finally, if someone is doing the work of worrying about fire codes etc. so you don't have to, don't get bummed out because they're not being fun. Respect the work they're doing or jump in and help out with the tedious, stressful details that have to be taken care of even if they're not fun.

Get this man a medal, he is a homemaker. /s", "He\u2019s soooo full of beans \ud83e\uded8", "Come on, give him some peace, he would offer his shirt of his baked beans to her! /s\n\nSeriously, until he understand that relationships are not on a two sided scale, where you can balance things continously, the relationship is over.", "Yeah, we got a joke for him:\n\nYou got your help, OP! She isn't with you anymore.", "Hope we get to hear her side! I bet there is SO MUCH MORE she could tell us about the AH!", "Nice try, but a bunch of the women at a wedding would be wearing heels.", "Maybe he will have better luck with wife number 2", "As well as \"i just tell people always my honest opinion...\"", "In my experience it\u2019s just a pathetic boomer mentality where your wife is \u201cthe old ball and chain\u201d. She\u2019s seen as a nag and an annoyance. It\u2019s really sad", "They didn't have to do this. They could have let women work or be independent. \n\nBut no, they made women pretty much wholly dependent on men through freaking law, made it OK to fire women (if they did work) if they were married or pregnant.\n\nAnd then complained what a freaking burden it was to be married, while never actually changing things.", "And I'd also suspect that the people who do these kinds of confusing pranks don't identify as \"jokesters\".  My partner and I have a fake plastic poo we take turns leaving around the flat for the other to find, for example. That's just being a bit silly.", "\ud83d\ude02", "Oh no. Poor married men unable to have sex with other women. I feel so bad for them /s", "And the wives can\u2019t have sex with other men and support the husbands and kids so equally \u201ctrapped \u201c", "Actually, traditionally it was acceptable for men to go to prostitutes and even sponsor a mistress, while if the wife side glanced at another guy she'd be shamed.", "And traditionally, in exchange they have a perpetual housekeeper and emotional support who permit them to have a job and a comfortable place to come back to every day, and that have sex only with them. Or alternatively for rural families like mine, women did their big part in cultivation and farm life while also delivering children and (again) being the main housekeeper. There is also a big discourse we could do about the pregnancy risks and how big contribution has always been (and in fact, the economy has always been based on that and wasn't planned for women not wanting to have that many children anymore, our economy is essentially based on free women labour of various kinds). There is a reason why men have always enforced marriage, they wouldn't had done it if it wasn't convenient.", "And \"traditionally\" women aren't supposed to have a job or access to their own money and can't have sex with other men so....?", "Exactly.", "There's a certain joy to be had in allowing them to call and letting it ring out or declining to take the call.", "Yeah but women WANT that. Big difference\u2026\n\n/s", "Are you serious? Women had ZERO rights. ZERO. If a woman wasn't married she was NOTHING. Traditionally, women did what they had to in order to survive the crappy misogynistic patriarchal world men forced upon them. \n\nThese \"jokes\" are a whiney way of crying about your lost male privilege now that women have a choice.", "What? Are you fucking serious?", "FYI in reddit-land a /s denotes sarcasm.", "I'm new here... so I sincerely apologize and will henceforth know that. Thank you for explaining \ud83d\ude4f"]}
