If you see that something is very important to the person you love or that it's something they're taking very seriously, don't add an unauthorized prank. This shouldn't have to be explained to a 31-year-old. Finally, if someone is doing the work of worrying about fire codes etc. so you don't have to, don't get bummed out because they're not being fun. Respect the work they're doing or jump in and help out with the tedious, stressful details that have to be taken care of even if they're not fun.
