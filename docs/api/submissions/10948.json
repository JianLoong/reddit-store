She has been the central mother figure in my life. Since I\u2019ve known her, she has taken on the role of my mom & I even call her \u201cmom\u201d since my actual mother has made no real attempts to be my mom, I have seen N as my \u201cmom,\u201d until recently.\n\nRecently, N & I have been budding heads. I\u2019ve done everything I can to make her feel welcome. I buy her candy, I make conversation with her, I involve her in my life, & I talk & hang out with her kids (who I still see as my siblings). I do everything in my power to make sure she feels welcome, I am afraid of her, as every time I enter a room with her in it, I feel uncomfortable & afraid of her presence, despite that, I still do everything I can to make her feel comfortable. Today I found out that she is blaming my brother & me for her not feeling happy here & that she might leave my dad because of my brother & me.\n\nMy father when telling us this said he will drop my brother & me like \u201cbad habits\u201d if we are to cause his relationship to fail & N leave forever. I feel extremely guilty. As today I started to yell & raise my voice at her because she was blaming me for something I did not do. Which she has done in the past, including blaming me for \u201ccausing\u201d my father & her to fight because I answered my dad\u2019s question innocently & was dragged into their drama. I did not think all of this would cause her to punish my father & think of actually leaving. I love N, it\u2019s just been hard recently with her because she has 0 trusts in me & refuses to believe me on anything, she also admitted that she refuses to parent my brother & I. I feel like shit & honestly I'm terrified for the future. For one, my dad might kick me out or disown me if she says I am to blame for her leaving, & I might lose the one mother figure I have while also losing my relationship with my dad, with whom I\u2019ve only had a relationship for 5 years. I'm terrified. I have no idea if I'm actually to blame here. I\u2019ll take full responsibility if I am, I just would like clarification.

It doesn\u2019t matter what you do, N is just abusive. Your father needs to get his priorities straight, you are his dependent.", "NTA. Adults shouldn't punish children bc theyre relationships are failing", "NTA and I am sorry none of the adults in your life understand unconditional love. You deserve better parents.", "NTA. I have kids, and if I ever had to choose between my kids and a boyfriend, I would pack his crap up myself and give him the boot out the door.", "OP I think this is \u201cabove Reddit\u2019s pay grade\u201d, in other words your situation sounds complex and serious. Obviously you are not an AH (so NTA). My heart aches for you: you and your brother seem to have had no reliable adults in your life for a long time, maybe ever. If you have any adults in your life that you can talk to - a teacher or school counselor maybe? - please talk to them about getting you and your brother some help.", "NTA. The adults are behaving like teenagers (that's not kind to teenagers) and the teen is being made a scapegoat. So sorry for you, and please do not blame yourself. None of them are reasonable. Calling your child a \"bad habit\"?? Wow. Just wow!", "NTA.  This is abuse from both your father and N.  You need help.  Seek counseling now.  If they try to kick you out, you have got to get child protective services involved.  I'm so sorry you are going through this.  You deserve better and a stable family environment!", "NTA. You're way too young to be caught up in this situation. Your Dad's GF wants out of the relationship, but it is to chicken shit to just leave. She needs the faux drama of difficult step children to lay the responsibility at someone else's feet. Your Dad is not thinking straight. I know it can't change your situation, but you should hear this...it's not your fault.", "Your dad choosing her over you & your brother is sad\u2026 NTA", "NTA, what they are doing is not ok. OP you should consider calling child services for some help.", "NTA. What your dad and his gf are doing to you is emotional, mental, and verbal abuse. You've said yourself that you're afraid of her. If you call child protective services and frame it like that, they'll listen. Unfortunately, it seems like gf favors her own kids over you & your brother, and dad's on that bandwagon. I'd hate for you and your brother to go into foster care, but if you have no other adults to turn to it may have to be like that at least until you and he are 18-21. Definitely talk to your school counselor, and get some new friends whose parents aren't anti-LGBTQ+.", "NTA. You are not ruining anything. Being a teenager is typically a challenging time for both the teenager and their parents. Unfortunately, neither of your parental figures are showing you true parental love. You shouldn't have to try so hard with N. If there is any way you can get therapy or counseling, I highly encourage you to do so. (Maybe through school?) It would be helpful for you to have a person like that in your life to help teach you what appropriate parent/child relationships should look like, and to help you deal with the emotional fallout of the challenges in your life. As much as you want these two to be loving parents to you, it may not be something they are capable of, and you may have to let that dream go. I would look for other stable adults who are willing to give you emotional support. Maybe getting closer to a friend that has really awesome parents and will welcome you like a family member?", "NTA\nGenuine question, do you really love her or you just fear her? Why would she even date a single dad and refuse to be a mother to his children and why does your dad love her more than his children. They're a messed up couple, you shouldn't even be involved in their relationshit problem.", "I see no ages for dad or his friend. Maybe dad stopped steping up and stopped wooing her so she is looking to blame someone. NTA \n\nWon't comment where dad's brain is, we all know where he is thinking from.\n\nSorry for your life stress.", "NTA. You don't deserve to have all this thrown at you.", "1000000% NTA. I\u2019m so sorry dear heart. They don\u2019t deserve you. Someday you will find someone who does. You may want to develop an emergency plan. In case your dad goes insane and does something really stupid like kicking you out. He will come to regret it in the future\u2014hopefully the near future. But you may suddenly be in a situation where you have to find alternative housing. Have someone lined up where you can spend a few days at least. Ugh fuck these so called parents. Fuck them.", "Is your bio mom still around. Could you move in with her?", "NTA!\n\nYour story is sad. I can't believe your dad would choose his girlfriend over your brother and you. There is nothing wrong with you. There problems is not your fault. It's as if you are being dragged into their drama that more than like stems from something else and not you and your sibling. There no way you should be walking around your home on pens and needles scared of this woman. I hope you finish high school and can eventually get to a point where you can move out if this situation continues as you have described it. I'm hoping you can go to a college where you can just stay on campus. It would be better for your mental health. I hope you have other family or a close friend who would let you move in if your dad decides to do something stupid like putting you out anytime soon.", "NTA\n\nYour dad's girlfriend is upset at her relationship with your dad and it's not actually got anything to do with you or what you have done.\n\nIt may be that she didn't want older kids in the mix and wanted to play happy families with just her kids and your dad.  So didn't want his kids along with the ride, but she's stuck it out for 3 years.  You aren't butting heads with her.  She is butting heads with you.  She may not want to tell your dad the real reason she is unhappy (something to do with him) so she is protecting herself by blaming you.\n\nShe may also be a wicked witch.\n\nYou've only been with your dad since you were 12.  Why was that - who did you live with before that?  I'm guessing your mom left you with someone.  But why weren't you with your dad?  Did he not know about you or did he not want anything to do with you and your brother till forced to?\n\nNone of this is your fault.  You have been traumatised by what has happened in your short life and you haven't got an adult in your corner yet.  Your dad is not a good dad if he's saying what he's saying.\n\nIf his girlfriend leaves he will probably blame you and your brother but neither of you have done anything wrong but he won't want to acknowledge the real reason for the break up which is completely between him and his girlfriend.", "I feel like we are missing info here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Child services can do a lot more than just basic needs - they can help you with therapy and even get your dad and the gf in on some family counselling. There is nothing \"just\" about this - it's not ok and its not normal. You are being emotionally abused by both.", "Maybe they'll do something once you get kicked out which I hope wouldn't happen.", "Yeah. That sucks. Cps is overworked and understaffed and if they can find an excuse to write off a horrible situation as normal they will. \n\nBut you are being given a ton of abandonment issues and bei.g put in roles that you aren't prepared for so at very Least therapy might help you avoid too much bad coping.", "Definitely pursue the therapy option then, remembering that there are online options these days. You can't choose your family, and unfortunately they are teaching you (by their actions) really inaccurate lessons about how loving relationships are supposed to look. That is stuff you'd rather get therapy for sooner than later in life, because you will need to deal with it at some point to be able to learn to have healthy relationships. \n\nAlso, I would start making plans to be independent. Think hard about what this means as far as the choices you make in life and what steps you can take to reach independence successfully. Do you have a job now, can you get one? Are there ways you can make money on the side? Do you have or are you able to get a bank account without your father being on it? Do you have a way to hide money from him? Are there choices in regards to your schooling that you should be making with independence in mind? Do you know how much housing costs in your area, and where to find roommate listings? Etc. Are you hoping to go to college? Does your school have a designated person you can meet with about that? Is there a teen center in your area you can go to to hang out at/get assistance with various things/have other role models? Is there a LGBTQ teen support group in your area?\n\nJust some ideas...", "I'm so sorry honey. You don't deserve to live like this. You've done nothing wrong. The adults in your life have failed you.

As a you minor should feel safe and secure when in the care of your parents. Your father\u2019s relationship is his responsibility and it\u2019s not up to a child to keep things peaceful and harmonious. All I can say is love and support your brother as much as you can as it sounds like you need each other.", "Ummm, NO; you are not to blame. Your father is pretty shitty for 1) involving you in their issues. 2) for threatening you basically for existing and 3) blaming you that his girlfriend is leaving him.   NONE of this is your fault, or issue. Do you have an aunt, or family you and your brother can stay with???? I'd get as far away from them as possible, and go NC. I am so sorry you are in this situation, and you may not like to hear it, but you are a child; not some object to be tossed around.", "NTA.   You are not to blame. Your dad is a piece of work.  Do you have any relatives, aunts uncles grandparents etc to turn to?   Can you ask your dad to see a counselor or ask for one at your school?", "You are the kid, they are the adults, and they are blowing it. You deserve better.", "NTA. You're not responsible for anything that happens in their relationship. I'm sorry you haven't been shown more love and consideration.", "NTA. Have seen similar old dad young stepmother relationship where husband is so scared of young wife leaving that they abandon their own children", "NTA. Your father AND his girlfriend are completely insane. They're immature and petty, especially when they're both blaming you when you've been nothing but accommodating. Unfortunately this isn't an unheard story with a step mother. There's a reason why we usually see the step mother as a villain. Your father should be ashamed of himself for his actions too.", "NTA but your dad and his girlfriend are major AH... You are 17, you are now seen as competition and no longer a child and no matter what you do, she will not love you back. Im so sorry, this is not your fault at all, you have sh*tty parents.", "Sadly, I wish more adults knew this. It seems commonplace", "Start making plans for when you are 18 in case they kick you out then.  This doesn't look good.", "Good!!!  Remember that these asshole adults are being so immature putting this on you. You have so much more emotional intelligence and grace than they do. Those traits will serve you well in life. I\u2019m proud of you."]}
