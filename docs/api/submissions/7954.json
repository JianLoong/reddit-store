I finally had enough last weekend during my partners birthday party and snapped at her. I told her MY mom is a doula, so not only does she know me, but she knows how to help laboring people. My labor was so stressful, I had a Ferguson reflex (basically the body is forcefully pushing the baby out when it\u2019s not ready) and I told her having her there would have made it 100x worse. My partner and his sister are on my side, they\u2019re both tired of hearing her complain, but her and his dad are mad at me.

They will continue to do so, because they are getting paid, I bet.  Second, she is not entitled to be in your room.  Nor is she entitled to be given a reason as to your own mom being in the room with you.  It is what YOU wanted.  It is not about her, not about what she wants.  And the continued narrative of making herself a victim because you \"gasp\" decided you didn't want a stranger looking at your hooha!  As someone who had an ex-MIL that did something similar to what your MIL is doing to you, eff that lady.  I should warn you, that she may start trying to undermine you as a mother.  She may have a complex about being more entitled to your child than you are.  But I could be projecting that part as well, since my ex MIL did that to me.", "NTA\n\nChild birth is not a spectator sport.  Your MIL had no reason to be in the delivery room if you didn\u2019t want her there.  Since she keeps bringing it up, you needed to shut her down.", "NTA \n\nYour birth, your choice. Super simple. \nShe\u2019s being an entitled brat, frankly", "NTA.. She can be disappointed and she can mention her disappointment a couple of times, but if she keeps keying in on it. She is out of line. She was cutting bait and she got what she wanted. Next child make it clear she won't be anywhere near the delivery room.", "NTA.  I have a controlling and highly intrusive MIL (e.g., wanted to be there during conception of my kid, wanting the sheets that he was conceived on).  She (MIL) demanded to be in the room during labor and delivery,as well as, to stay with my wife an I after our son was born. My wife had a difficult pregnancy and I refused, vehemently, any kind of nonsense from MIL.

She overstepped boundaries then, and she continues to overstep boundaries now. My suggestion is the next time she brings it up, tell her you are done hearing about it and LEAVE. If she continues, consider finding a different babysitter for the weekends.", "NTA. This is obviously getting old, and she needs to grow up.  I'm a smart ass so I would just say how sorry you are she didn't get a good look at your \ud83d\udc08\u200d\u2b1b and she totally missed out. Hopefully, she will shut up forever.", "NTA. This may be hard for her to understand but it is your baby. Not hers. You are well within your rights to kick her out of the delivery room and completely out of your life if you want to. If she wants to spend time with her grandkids she needs to be nice to you. No the other way around.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She\u2019s definitely not quite that level, she mostly just complains and does a lot of the emotional blackmail bs. They are both just a lot. Thankfully they don\u2019t put energy into leaving their house, so once we move I don\u2019t have to worry about them around my daughter to much.", "Lucky for me, I\u2019m one and done lol. So I don\u2019t have to explain to her she doesn\u2019t get to be in the room the second time, just that she doesn\u2019t get a second grandchild from me.", "Unfortunately I doubt that would make her stop. She makes weird comments about my body already, mainly my chest. The longer I was in labor the more undressed I got, on top of all the other reasons i didn\u2019t want her in the room, she definitely would have been making weird comments about that too I\u2019m sure.", "Oh, please do move away.

I'm so sorry you have to deal with this person.", "NTA birth is disgusting and it\u2019s weird AF that she feels so entitled to watch yours.\n\ni can only imagine it would be even weirder for you if she had been there, she\u2019d probably make comments about your vagina regularly in front of people.", "The state pays your IL's for watching your daughter on the weekends? How and why does this happen? Not judging, just have never heard of anything like this before.", "NTA..\n\n\nTruth hurts.  MIL isn't a victim here.", "I think that is a very important point about her constantly repeating it.  Generally people can say anything to me once or twice, but some people go over and over the same thing, even when I tell them that it is my decision, or I'm not interested, or this is getting tedious, and I don't care to discuss it further.   I remember it from the first couple of times that it was said.   To keep repeating it is nagging or even harassment.", "Did the MIL offer to use a turkey baster so she could be considered the father?", "I would be careful with my kids around her, imo she sounds unhinged still talking about this. NTA.", "Nta. Being disappointed is one thing. HARPING on it is immature and manipulative. Them being pissy is a them problem. And like someone else said, they're getting paid, and it's their granddaughter, they won't stop sitting (imo)... ... but mil will probably make this her new harp topic... can you find another sitter?... that would be paid in the same manner?

Birth is not a spectator sport! But if she is soooo insistant she missed out, publicly and loudly invite her to your next Pap Smear. She can have a front row up close view.

I can\u2019t speak for any other states that do it, but at least that\u2019s what Oregon does.", "We live next door to them at the moment, so that\u2019s the main reason why they babysit. My family takes her sometimes too. Once we move away, I\u2019m definitely going LC. I know once we move, she will just start complaining about how she never sees her. I know this because she already makes comments about when we move away how she will never get to see her granddaughter.", "Have you asked her what her problem was ? People like love to test boundaries, a reality check should do the work", "Yey. You have an out! Had an aunt have to wait through a hostility stage before moving across the country. She had spent 20 yrs living blocks away from ALL of her inlaws. After the kids grew up, she wanted to live closer to her family for a bit... she was accused of \"taking their brother away\" for months... ---- deep breath. You have an out. You'll get there.", "NTA. I can never understand women who insist on watching their DILs give birth. Why??? I'd rather watch Netflix on my cellphone while in the waiting room. I'd still see the baby later after all.", "NTA. \n\nAsk her why she's so obsessed with watching a baby rocket out of your vag next time it's mentioned. Will not seeing your stretched and straining vulva impact her relationship with her grandchild? Is she going to love this kid less because she didn't get to force her presence on you in your most vulnerable moment? \n\nYou don\u2019t need a reason to refuse access to someone in the delivery room. It's a medical procedure. You owe her no explanation. No means no. The entitlement of her is unbelievable,  like, they can see it from space.", "NTA. If MIL kept quiet, so would you. She hlwas not entitled to attend the birth and every time she acts like that, she shows why you didn't want her there.", "Nta, what is it with MILs wanting to watch their grandkids be born? It's not exactly a spectator sport, it's a serious medical matter. Your confort is what counts, not her (frankly bizarre) desires", "NTA. I will never in a million years understand why so many people (particularly a lot of MILs) think they have a right to be in the delivery room. Only the birthing mother and her doctor/birthing team have the right to be there\u2014 everyone else is entirely at her discretion. The end.", "I\u2019m not a parent, but my BF and I now live across the country from his parents. There were a variety of reasons we moved, but one of the big ones was to give her less access to/attempted control of our personal lives."]}
