Fiancee is close with his nanna & mum,\nthey mostly raised him. Mum is disabled, it\u2019s progressive. She\u2019s reliant on nanna, including for decisions. Nanna has caused a few issues during planning but I\u2019ll focus on the main one. TL;DR at the end. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e\u2019s cousin got married last week. His mother and nanna had to travel and stay over night for the wedding. Fiancee went but I was unable. Nanna decided to bring mum\u2019s dog and leave him in the car for the wedding and overnight which upset us. She said that she will do this for our wedding too. \n\nFiancee and I discussed and agreed not to allow this. Especially since she wants to travel for our wedding over a few days and the dog would be left alone for at least 3 days as a result. \n\nFiancee called nanna and told her that we\u2019d prefer it if she made alternative arrangements for the dog. This was 2 days after cousin\u2019s wedding. She called 10mins later to say she was offended & we\u2019d need to find another way to get mum to the wedding because she wasn\u2019t coming. \n\nFianc\u00e9e was devastated. We left it for 2 days and tried again. Before fiancee could bring the dog up up, nanna went off saying she was \u2018ashamed of him that he would think she would be unkind to the dog\u2019 he \u2018chose to pick this fight close to the wedding\u2019 & she\u2019s had a \u2018rough year\u2019. We again left it. \n\nWe spoke with BIL (M22) & his wife (F23) who have also been talking to nanna. They agree that leaving the dog in the car is risky & cruel. Nanna spoke with BIL a few times & said that she won\u2019t change her mind. BIL plans to visit nanna to speak in person. \n\n2 days after Fiancee last spoke to nanna, Fiancee\u2019s uncle called, said we \u2018shouldn\u2019t have expressed our opinion\u2019 & nanna \u2018has been through a lot\u2019. Uncle said that he can transport mum but can\u2019t do her care. So if nanna doesn\u2019t come, mum probably won\u2019t be able to. \nFiancee is devastated. I still feel leaving the dog in the car is wrong. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m TA but the conflict is getting to me. \n\nTL;DR fianc\u00e9e\u2019s nanna wants to bring dog to wedding & leave him in the car. Fiancee & I said she needs to get the dog cared for properly. She is now saying that she won\u2019t come to wedding which may also prevent fiancee\u2019s mum from coming. His family are spilt on the issue. AITA for enforcing this boundary?\n\nETA: I\u2019m sorry this is so hard to read. I was emotional writing this and got super caught up with the character limit. I have edited for clarity.\n\nEdit: we have offered many solutions for the care of the dog. He was from a rescue who offered to care for him if they ever went away. We have suggested the rescue, boarding, pet sitters, pet friendly hotels and friends in the area. All suggestions are shot down and ignored because nanna insists that he was \u2018fine\u2019 when she left him in the car at the other wedding.", "created_utc": 1692424060, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15v7mbt/aita_for_enforcing_a_boundary_that_may_cause_my/", "score": 299, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

C has caused a few issues during planning.TL;DR at the end for main issue. \nFirstly F\u2019s cousin J (F26) hadn\u2019t seen K or C for 3 years. J wouldn\u2019t get vaccinated during pandemic, K\u2019s disability makes her vulnerable. They chose not to be around her. F\u2019s brother O (22) married in 2022. J was not invited and she hasn\u2019t seen us for years. We didn\u2019t invite J due to C and K. A few months after we sent out invitations, C sent us a passive aggressive message about not inviting J. F called J & invited her. \n6 weeks before wedding, C calls. Said J was getting married a few weeks before us & asked to invite her husband (who we didn\u2019t know about). She kept saying we may have \u2018a cancellation\u2019 if we didn\u2019t. We said final numbers were in, RSVPs were due months ago and this should\u2019ve been asked sooner. We were upset about how this was handled & the late notice so F messaged J to tell her that. J said that it was a question & C added the threat. She said she understood it was last minute & will still come.\nHer wedding was last week. I was unable to go but F went. K has had a dog Z for a few months. C decided to bring Z & leave him in the car for the wedding (they were away for 5.5 hours) & overnight (returned to car at 9:30). C said that she was doing this for our wedding too. It would be for 3+ nights & and she would leave Z in the car the whole time.

I don\u2019t know how I can make that any clearer. \n\nAnd no, I don\u2019t think crate training is cruel. It\u2019s great when done properly. What is cruel about the car is that it is not created to be a safe space (like a crate) and heats up to deadly temperatures very quickly. This causes heatstroke and death.

Ultimately it is going to be distracting and upsetting for you to have the dog in the car while you get married. (Also not kind or safe for the dog.) It's pretty reasonable to request that alternative arrangements are made.\n\nI think you need to sit down with your fiance and have a serious talk about how important it is for Nanna to be at your wedding. Obviously his mom is important- but surely there have been situations when others cared for her. Nanna is not the only option. I think this is the best plan. \n\n(Edit to add- if mom travels without Nanna, you should still consider the dog's welfare. Is he going to be left with Nanna?)\n\nIf it IS important to your fiance for Nanna to be there (if only to keep family peace), you need to be strategic. I recommend making a plan with family/friends to help you manage the situation. Don't expect Nanna to change her mind about the dog because she's not going to- this is a power move.\n\nHere is a potential scenario:\n\nSomeone (an obliging groomsman, perhaps) can create some pretext, kidnap the dog in the morning, and leave the dog with a kennel or dogsitter for the day of the wedding.

This is not about who SHOULD pay, it's about your day going smoothly. Don't give her ammo. \n\nIf you go this route I'd be prepared for more drama from Nanna, so you need to get someone to run interference. Assign some cousins or friends the task of wrangling Nanna so you don't have to deal with her on your wedding. If she does confront you, just be really nice and look puzzled and say something like, \"I have no idea what you are talking about! Anyway I'm so glad you made it to the wedding! Sorry I have to check in with my dad about the pictures\" and just walk away.\n\nI hope you find a good solution!
