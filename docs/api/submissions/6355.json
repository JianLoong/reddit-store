They are struggling but are doing nothing to better their situations. They want to leave our mothers house but have made no attempt to do it on their own terms. They are telling me I turned my back on them and the family because I won\u2019t help them and I know, deep down, that allowing them to move in with me would be the worst mistake I ever made because they won\u2019t change. I feel horrible for telling them no, but only because our mother is continuing to deal with them. Should I say yes and put myself into a horrible situation to save her?

It\u2019s not your responsibility to care for grown adults and children you didn\u2019t conceive. If you\u2019re able to efficiently take care of yourself, your older brother should be able to as well. You\u2019re not the 3rd parent of your moms 5 other children.", "NTA.  But you'd be very stupid if you let them move in.  They are not your children and not your responsibility.  I would do it if they were responsible and just fell on hard times but it doesn't sound at all like that applies here.", "OP you are NTA, it isn't your burden to bear to try to help your brothers who keep making the same mistake by not actively seeking out help for what is burdening them. As long as that remains the case, their situation is unlikely to change, all that would change by taking them in is their enabler changes", "NTA.\nYour brothers haven't managed to get on their feet in their parents house. What miracle is supposed to happen after they move in to your place? I don't see any predictable change in their behaviour just because it's your house.", "NTA\n\nOne of things I've heard a lot since quitting drinking was that an alcoholic typically has to reach rock bottom before recovery can begin.  Your brothers will never reach rock bottom if your Mom insists on swooping in to save them from the ramifications of their actions every time.", "NTA  They have sucked every bit of compassion and finances out of your mother, and now they are looking for someone else to ENABLE them to continue living  without any responsibilities.\n\nThey refuse to go to a program.  They don't want to get clean.\n\nThey want guaranteed meals and lodging.  And nobody to nag them about sobriety.  And they think YOU will provide it.\n\nIf they move in, they will drain your bank account, befoul your house, and make you sorry you ever let them in. If you say anything to them about their behavior, they'll tell you \"You're not my mom! You can't tell me what to do.\"\n\nThey won't move out when asked, either.  They probably know EXACTLY how many days they can stay before you need a lawyer to evict them.\n\nThis isn't people who NEED help. They REFUSED help.  Their own father had to back away from this train wreck.\n\nThey are adults, one of whom has children he should be parenting and providing support for. Not puking into a bucket on your couch.\n\nPeople try to pull the \"But familllyyyy\" card to get people to do what they want. Do not fall for it.  You do not need two stoned jobless men in your house, eating all your food.\n\nConsider attending a few Al-Anon family meetings to see how others have handled similar situations.\n\nTL; DR    OH HELL NO!", "NTA. I've been sober for six years and I have to say this: Your parents have to STOP enabling your brothers. This is serious. Sobriety will never happen without rock bottom. They will never actually *grow up* without facing the consequences of their actions and learning their lessons the hard way.\n\nThey can't just be foisted onto you to be provided with another safety net. Every addict I know who was enabled or coddled is either dead or still in active addiction. The ones, like myself, whose parents tossed them out (with tough love) are sober and thriving. They have to get better for themselves. They have to make the decision, you can't just convince them to, it doesn't work that way.\n\nI'm sorry you are dealing with this, but you have to stop buying them things and helping them. You're making it worse. I wish you the best of luck, this will be a tough thing for you to watch in the short term... But it does get better.", "NTA this will ruin your life if you let them live with you and you know it\n\nYou did not father these children and are not responsible for them\n\nDo not under any circumstance accept this responsibility- it isnt yours", "NTA. I'm in recovery, and sometimes the ONLY thing that works is the family putting their foot down. Stay strong. You are not responsible for them or their self-created problems.", "Thank you everyone for the comments. I suffer from clinical depression and it can be hard to make these types of decisions without feeling overwhelming dread that I could be being a horrible son / brother. I\u2019m glad that people here seem to agree", "NTA. Don't do it. You'll be in the same situation as her down the line. She needs to set her own boundaries, just as you are doing, to save her sanity, but that is not your responsibility to make her see that.", "A very strong NTA. Your mom, unfortunately, is not actually helping either of your brothers by enabling their behavior, and it will not help them for you to suddenly take on the role of enabler. Forcing someone to stand on their own is hard but sometimes necessary and it sounds like your mom has reached that point. It's time for your brothers to be responsible for themselves. If at all possible, mom could benefit from talking with a therapist about cutting the strings. It goes against all of your mothering instincts to think you're making your (grown) child suffer, but she can't take care of them forever and you are not the answer to their problems.", "NTA. Stick to your guns. Your parents made them who they are, they can continue to deal with them.", "NTA. If you can, look out for your niblings and three youngest brothers, but you don't owe your two adult brothers anything. They need to want to be helped to be better before they can get the help they need (rock bottom as others here put it), rather than somewhere to shift the status quo to. If you can help your three youngest brothers avoid the paths the other two went down, that's a win for everyone.", "NTA\n\nYou are in no way responsible to support and parent your adult siblings.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

(Joking) \n\nYou already know the answer. They need to learn to take care of themselves. The very best thing you could do for everyone is take your mother to some Al-Anon meetings. She can learn about how to support her sons without enabling them, and get support herself as she works her way through what has to be a miserable situation.", "NTA\n\nIt's not your job to look after your brothers. Never has been, never should be. You are already helping out by buying your younger brothers gifts so your mum doesn't have to. You don't need to do more.", "NTA The proper \"way out\" is for them to be forced to stand on their own two feet. Your mother may be stuck in the mindset that they are her children who need looking after, but her enabling of them has partially lead to where they are now.\n\nThe reality of the proposed \"way out\" is taking the load off your mother and putting it on you, with the actual result being them enabled in their current self-destructive lifestyles indefinitely so they don't hit rock bottom; but it is precisely hitting rock bottom (or fearing that) with no one acting as their cushion that will force them to stand on their own feet and start getting their lives together. They never will as long as they can live in a cushioned bubble that enables their current lifestyles.\n\nIf you let them move in you are not only creating your own Hell but keeping them in theirs indefinitely too. It's lose-lose. Your mother, even if she refuses to admit this, even to herself, wants to escape the Hell partially of her creation, swapping you in for her so the Hellish situation is maintained without her having to live in it.", "NTA. They are not your responsibility, and they are perfectly capable of being their own responsibility, which is how it should be at their ages. It would be one thing if they were trying to get clean and asked you help to be able to afford a program... you would still not have any inherent duty to fund them, but I could see why you might choose to. \n\nBut it's downright foolish to care more about anyone's welfare than they care about their own. And if these guys cared about their own welfare, they would get clean instead of looking for another enabler.", "Nah bro I'm sorry for your mom, she didn't get a girl, and where I live they abort girls ;-; \n\nalso NTA for standing your ground to leeches", "NTA. Keep those mooches out of your house. They are not your problem and your mother could kick them out and she won't. So they will remain her problem.", "No", "NTA your mom needs to give them the boot", "NTA 100%!! if something the AH is your parents for permitting this kind of behavior. they are grown adults for crying out loud!\n\na recommendation I have is to tell your parents that if your brothers won\u2019t check into a program and actively try to put their lives back together they won\u2019t be welcome to live at your parents house. hopefully this could possibly give them a reality check. \n\nbest of luck and i hope everything goes well!!", "NTA Your parents are asking you to be an enabler. You're right that your brothers need rehab programs, not free rent.", "NTA Your not responsible for your older and younger brother especially given that they are 31 and 25 respectively.\n\nIt\u2019s time for them to learn to stand on their own 2 feet without relying on your mother and her home as a backup, and time for your mother to step up and give them tough love, by giving them their 30 days notice to find both a job and a place to live in. \n\nYour mother also need to stop enabling them both and stand up and start holding them accountable for their behaviours, as your younger brothers don\u2019t need to witness their self destructive behaviours and think that it\u2019s acceptable.\n\nThey need to live on their own, financially support themselves and learn the harsh way that they need to pay their own bills, make their own food, clean up after themselves and learn to be held accountable for their own actions now that they are adults. \n\nGet your mother to go down to the court house and file formal eviction paperwork and have them both served. Once the 30 days are up then they can have the sheriff remove them, and change her locks.\n\nAs harsh as it may be, you may need to sit down both your parents and do include your father in this and tell them calmly and firmly that they are responsible for enabling your brothers. They\u2019ve chosen to allow it to continue for far too long. \n\nRemind them that you\u2019ve all had the same opportunities that they\u2019ve had, and you\u2019ve managed to graduate college, maintain a job, find a place of your own, and compared to both of your brothers adult successfully, and it\u2019s not fair on you to have to bail your brothers out, to help out your parents and that\u2019s not your job. \n\nIf your mother refuses to do something about them, then calmly and firmly tell her you no longer want to hear anything about either brother from her, and seeing as she may choose not to do something, it may be time for you to stop your financial support in buying things for your younger brothers, because of your mother decides to not do anything, then it\u2019s also time for you to stop enabling your mother and let her deal with lack of money moving forward.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA. They need to put on the big boy undies and live in the real world.", "NTA those are grown ass men who choose to not work.  Maybe a little homelessness will provide some much needed motivation.", "NTA", "NTA, but maybe let them in for a couple of weeks then kick them out, effectively prying them out of your mom\u2019s house.", "I think he meant he\u2019s buying his youngest brothers (the ones who aren\u2019t addicts and are still children) things like presents. So I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s an issue. \n\nOtherwise, I agree it sounds like the 25 year old and 31 year old have had plenty of coddling and any chance of getting better will happen after they\u2019ve been kicked out.", "depression can be tough, and its inspiring how you still try your best to help your younger siblings. but know in no way, shape, or form is this your problem at all in regards to your brothers that are grown ass adults. you will make it through the situation and i hope your parents will eventually understand your position as family drama can be so overwhelming.", "OP please god don\u2019t do this. Getting them out won\u2019t be easy and you will be stuck with them. They aren\u2019t teenagers. They are fully grown adults. Your mom has enabled them into this mess. If your dad and mom don\u2019t feel responsible for them why should you? Please just don\u2019t let them in. If you do they will never leave and you will be stuck with them forever.", "I feel like that would introduce a whole new set of problems even if it\u2019s just for a little. OP should not be taking any responsibility at all for his brothers cuz once he does they\u2019re going to think they can keep bothering him to take care of them. Best bet is to convince the mom to kick them out, which she may not agree to but that\u2019s really the most OP can reasonably do.", "Yes, if OP let's them in, he won't find it so easy to get them to leave. His own parents have realised this. NTA"]}
