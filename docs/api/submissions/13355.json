People won't change if they don't want to, and they clearly don't want to change. Also, neglect is a form of abuse.", "NTA and with how they behaved its much better to go no contact again, they clearly havent changed and to be honest its worrying me a little you even have to ask if you are the AH\n\nPlease dont undo any of the hard work you have done by allowing these people in your life\n\nBlood is not what makes a family", "Obviously not the asshole. Limits are limits and even your therapist suggested not seeing them.

You are setting a low bar and they aren't even attempting to hit it.", "NTA. They were abusive parents and unless they're prepared to work with you, you're probably better off cutting them off again. Well done getting to a place where you feel better able to deal with their crap, don't let them drag you back down again!", "NTA in any way. You are right not to trust them. They want everything on their terms and refuse to acknowledge your feelings or what you've been through. It's really not worth it. They're the ones who are playing games.", "NO, NO NO, NTA! \n\nThey're refusing to even take you seriously,, unless it's 2 on 1, and they can pressure you. If you've been doing better, reconnecting is only going to invite more instability, since they have little interest in anything you've said so far.\n\nYou're not setting them up for failure either. That is 100% on them. A parent has to fucking show up and be decent 30% of the time for a child to have a connection and bond. If they already failed, that means they already gave less than 30%.", "NTA they bring shovels everytime just continue to be happy where you are.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like, regardless of how ready you are, your parents aren't ready to take any responsibility or any interest in you as a person.", "NTA, you are simply just protecting yourself and your mental health. I think you're incredibly brave for even wanting to try to mend your relationship, it's only fair you want to do this your way and take it slow.", "NTA. They proved themselves as toxic.

You are not finished in therapy.", "NTA! Keep your peace and energy protected. Blood doesn\u2019t equal entitlement of access to you. I hate being bombarded when I fall for the \u201ctalking in person is easier\u201d crap. Good luck!", "I agree completely. OP, please continue therapy until you are more able to recognize the effects of that abuse, cut the parents off, and heal your trauma. You have to do that to avoid passing their crap on to your beautiful new family. You don't need these texts. Block block block.

Of course I wonder if I\u2019m the asshole.", "You 0hrased this perfectly! Hear, hear.", "NTA\n\nOP when people actually hated you, then they wouldn't want to be around you.\n\nThis means that your family actively abuses you to make themselves feel powerful.\n\nWhy would they want to fix their relationship with you, if you're not going to be their victim anymore?\n\nDon't expose your real family to their toxicity. \n\nThey may want your children to take your place.", "NTA. It's not your fault, but you are making a rookie mistake here. Your mental health is improved, you are feeling better, so you think your ready to dive back into the toxic situation you left because you think you can handle it now. Even this little bit of contact with your manipulative family has you doubting yourself and feeling bad.  Please talk to your therapist about this.", "NTA. You are right. You set a incredibly low bar and they failed to clear it. You might miss having a larger family, but do you really think that it is worth it? They clearly haven't changed and are unwilling to even send a few texts asking about you or your kids. Go back to NC like all the other commenters are saying.", "NTA.  If they're not willing to abide by your terms, then you should not trust them or have them in your life.", "NTA. They are proving why your request to start with text was necessary, and they are showing that they aren't planning to change. I'm so sorry you're going through this again.", "NTA and I can understand the guilt and pain you are feeling because I have similar issues. And something I have to keep reminding myself of is that its okay to miss them but its also okay for you to keep your distance. A negligent parent can only improve with help and therapy. If they are willing to try; you shouldn\u2019t have to beat yourself up.", "I came here to say the exact same thing.", "Lower your contact with those people then. You've already done so when it came to your parents, do the same again. Life is too short to deal with assholes. Especially if you're capable of protecting yourself from their constant guilt trips.", "It sounds like you have 25 family members who are being vocal about having the wrong opinion. They don't know your situation. It really doesn't matter what they think."]}
