Well done getting to a place where you feel better able to deal with their crap, don't let them drag you back down again!", "NTA in any way. You are right not to trust them. They want everything on their terms and refuse to acknowledge your feelings or what you've been through. It's really not worth it. They're the ones who are playing games.", "NO, NO NO, NTA! \n\nThey're refusing to even take you seriously,, unless it's 2 on 1, and they can pressure you. If you've been doing better, reconnecting is only going to invite more instability, since they have little interest in anything you've said so far.\n\nYou're not setting them up for failure either. That is 100% on them. A parent has to fucking show up and be decent 30% of the time for a child to have a connection and bond.
