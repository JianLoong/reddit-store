There are plenty of facts out there and it's not as if we just randomly mention them absent a context that makes them relevant.

They should just be happy their son found someone he loves instead of being shitty people.", "Definitely NTA\n\nI truly understand your feelings but I will say if I were your Mom I would be upset with your reaction. Your Mom\u2019s job was her job. She worked presumably to pay bills & care for her family. She clearly raised a lovely daughter that your husband fell in love with. None of your Mom\u2019s hard work should ever make you feel less than or \u201cremind you of your place\u201d.

His family used that as a weapon against you, and it sounds like they\u2019re still trying to keep you in your place, especially in this instance where it\u2019s how they introduce you to others.\n\nJust block your spouse\u2019s family members.", "NTA and good for your husband standing up for you against his family. Not something seen often on here.", "NTA. The only way you would be is if you took the bait and responded to his family after he said not to. Your husband\u2019s family is his battle. Sounds like you got a great one!!!", "NTA. Mostly because that's rude what she did. Then because you're allowed to have the feelings you did and also share them with your husband. And finally, I hate when families hold a person's spouse accountable for their behaviour. Your husband is an adult, he chooses how he acts. \n\nThey are just mad because they can't believe it themselves that they are judgemental.", "NTA!\n\nAnd hubby points to your OH!!

We all know it's not just what you say but also how you say it.\n\nThey know what they were doing but didn't expect to have to face the consequences. Now the consequences of their own actions are here and they want you to back down so your husband is also forced to back down. \n\nDie on this hill, otherwise it will never end.

You cried genuine tears when your husband asked you what was wrong. You did nothing wrong.\n\nYour husband stood up to his family for you because he loves you and believes you. He did nothing wrong, either. He presumably knows his aunt better than you do, so don't second guess his actions. If he was rude to her, he must have thought she had it coming.\n\nHis family is now trying to blame you so that they can avoid feeling responsible for being judgmental snobs. Listen to your husband. Avoid responding no matter how much they try to provoke you.\n\n>my mother having worked for the family was merely a fact\n\nIt's probably also a fact that the aunt wet her bed at least once at some point in her childhood, but that would be irrelevant to mention now, wouldn't it? What makes the aunt think that the story of how you and your husband met is an appropriate story for her to tell to your husband's new cousin-in-law? Your aunt has no good reason to be gossiping about how her nephew married \"one of the help.\" Even if it didn't bother you, it would be a rude and classist topic to bring up. Since it does hurt you, and she had reason to know that it would, her sharing the \"facts\" seems intentionally cruel.", "No, you are NTA and your husband did exactly the right thing. Let those people rot", "NTA.  Your background is what made you into the person that your husband loves.  There is no need to feel shame about what your mother did for employment.  The small minds of IL's will never grasp the truth of your being and should never be given the opportunity to address you in any way except as you are as a person and the wife of their son/nephew.  It's husband's job to make it so, and he seems willing.  IMO you should strictly cooperate with husband's request to not reply to any of IL's attempts to contact you.   It might be best if you just block them.  You and husband are enough for each other and don't need contact with IL's.  Be happy.  :-)", "NTA", "NTA - and your husband sounds like a keeper.\n\nUnless her son's fiance asked how you two met, there's no reason for your aunt to bring it up (and even if they or anyone were to ask, it's *your* story to tell - if you choose). That it has been a topic over the years as you describe shows that the intent is to be hurtful, mocking, or both. The simple fact that it makes you feel the way it does is enough reason for it to not be brought up - that she does shows that at the very least she does not care about how her words & actions impact you or make you feel.\n\nYou have nothing to feel ashamed of, by the way - but it's understandable that his family bringing it up would be upsetting for you.", "NTA. And please, having worked for someone, having had an honest job, how on earth can that be shameful or embarassing in any way? Your husbands aunt is an ass, and your husband is right: A block of ice would be good for them to sit on for a while. The 19th century called and wanted their questionable values back!", "Nta. They sound like horrible people. I\u2019m a fairly direct person, I appreciate that he said something. However, it\u2019s important to think about what you say when confronting people who think they\u2019re better than others and show that continually by making rude comments. Not going to help anyone realize their wrong ways if they\u2019re  focused more on how loud or mean he was.\n\nAnd people who find crying manipulative are an especially weird kind of screwed up. They\u2019re probably beyond repair / not worth it. They need deep therapy going back to childhood/formative years, and they clearly want to see their world through their own ducked up lens. Lost cause. \n\nKill \u2018em with kindness and know that they\u2019re horrible people. The truth will always come out. Hopefully you can compartmentalize. Maybe make a game out of it with your husband so when it happens. Next time you all get to get her, make \u2018bets\u2019 on who\u2019s saying something first and when they\u2019re going to do it or what they\u2019ll say. (Ex- MIL before dessert.

And context and intent matters here.\n\nIt is a statement of fact that your mom was their nanny.  That is nothing to be ashamed of.  That fact doesn\u2019t magically disappear.\n\nBut the context is weird (upon first introducing someone) and the intent seems clear.  Particularly to your spouse.  And there is a clear history of intent.\n\nManaging his family is on him.  If they want to apologize to you, they should have that opportunity (for the benefit of you and your husband).  And they can talk to your spouse about that (who can then see if you are comfortable with that idea).", "NTA. sounds like he probably has had his share of abuse about it.

She really was their everything . . . basically the mother and father they barely had! They were so blessed to have her.\"  \n\nLay it on thick. They're trying to make a good job sound shameful. And normally I would never shame working parents who need help, but in this case your in-laws deserve it.
