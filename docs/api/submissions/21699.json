As to the wasting the money, your parents knew nothing would be gained from taking the test and still paid for it, that's kind of on them. Getting 4th could potentially give you an edge for college admissions maybe? Not sure how it works in your country.\n\nYour parents are the ones acting childish by comparing you to your older brother and even when you did better than him on the test defending their overt bias towards him.", "The best revenge is to live well.  Slight YTA because you will never convince them of anything.  Go to college, succeed, and don\u2019t invite them to graduation.

This should not happen.", "If they didn't play favorites and put you down for not being 'as smart' as your brother, I doubt this would have happened.

You are justified.", "YTA. Hopefully you'll grow up before university", "YTA.\n\nThis is very childish.", "YTA and your parents are too for their favoritism.\n\nOk, so I guess I should have gone E S H except the brother.", "ESH\n\nYou need to learn that you don't need to prove anything to anyone. Taking a test and wasting money just to prove to them that you are better or that your brother isn't the best is incredibly petty. You didn't take the prize which makes you honorable but honestly, it's still petty as hell. Your parents also suck, playing favorites is toxic. You and your brother are individuals with different strengths and weaknesses. Both deserving of praise and the same amount of joy and pride. They are doing both of you a disservice and robbing you of a good relationship with your sibling by comparing you to him. \n\nDo things not to prove them wrong, but to prove to yourself that you can go the distance and that you are as great as you have always believed you are. I hope you have a great college experience and break free from your parent's unfair judgment of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You had a real shot at getting 1st.\n\nThere's a double standard here with your brother staying 2 hours being a sign of how smart he is, but you staying 2 hours showing that you weren't trying hard enough.", "TBH I think they are just pissed that I proved their precious boy is not as smart as me\n\nAnd because they are pissed that 3 people were better than me. I am the top student in my grade so everyone knew I'd get the scholarship lol. But I figured others probably need it more", "I think that is a bad take away instilled by your parents choosing favorites. Both you and your brother have strengths and weaknesses and its not a competition between you. There is no one way to be smart and you both preformed very well and your parents should be equally proud of both of you.\n\nIf you want to have a healthy relationship with your brother through the rest of your life, it will be important to ditch the sibling rivalry and see each other for who you are, not how you compare to the other.", "Your parents did this to YOU by always saying the older brother is smarter that you.  What do they expect?  They set up this rivalry.\n\nKids are individuals and have different strengths and talents.\n\nThey could have handled by saying he is smart, and then you are smart too.

Not about you 'wasting' their money, which I don't think you did, but I think you were an AH to yourself for not doing your best for your own future. If you'd gotten number one, which is sounds like you could have, you might have gotten a free ride to anywhere you wanted, whereas you did yourself a disservice to prove something to your parents that they'll never admit (because they're AHs). Now, I did much, much worse at about the same time and about the same kind of thing, which might be why this made me wince, but I think you need to just write off your parents and get on with showing them by way of your success.", "NTA.  \nI'm tne second child in my family.

I don\u2019t blame you for wanting to prove that your parents are wrong in thinking that your brother is smarter than you are.

I still don't think that's a great mindset, tho.", "Not wanting to screw over your fellow student isn\u2019t a good mindset?", "I don\u2019t think you are the AH but I do think you are arguing with a brick wall.

It was obviously a possibility that she could have won even at 2 hours, so not sure that was really primary in her considerations.  More that she wanted to outdo her brother, regardless of other considerations which, while I understand, no, I don't think that was a good mindset.

My parents are just like yours. I did get awards and recognition that my brother did not get. However, none of that mattered to them. What I eventually had to do was put some distance between us. I went low contact with all of them. I started to feel better about myself, and then nothing that they had said bothered me anymore. I realized I was enough no matter what they thought. Years later, my brother started making comparisons when I visited him. He was yucking it up and bragging about how much money he makes compared to me blah blah blah. I just looked at him, smiled, and just said, \"Yeah. Well. I'm still far happier and satisfied with my life.\" He laughed and said he was happy. I pointed out that happy people don't have the desire to make comparisons. Insecure people do. God he was pissed. But it also shut him the fuck up. Win, by just living better.

And she said she already knew where she was definitely going, and had a full ride. Let\u2019s say the person in 5th place gets $1k scholarship i stead of the $10k they would have gotten if she wasn\u2019t there - not because she needed money for college but to have something to lord over her brother - and now cannot attend college. And she never considered that. That makes her TA. Saying \u201cstudy more\u201d is a stupid response. This is a hypothetical person.
