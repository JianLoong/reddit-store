A car wasn\u2019t looking and hit me from the side breaking my right hand so im sorry for bad spelling and stuff because its tuff. Anyway my step sister has 4 kids who are demons spawn and they all live with me and our parents. 24/7 they just scream and throw temper tantrums, so yesterday im lying down trying to sleep in bed with my noise canceling headphones when i get violently shaken awake wich caused me to hit my hand. And all i see is my step sisters kids who range from 2 to 10 and she is 27. So i in pain tell them to leave, and they said that there mom left the house to drive 6 hours away to go to her friends house and she left them with me mind you our parents are in business trips so its just me and them. While she had left about 3 hours ago so i called her and told her if she isnt back in 4 hours im calling the cops and telling them that they are abandoned and she just hung up. So 4 hours later shes not back so i called my stepdad to ask him what to do and he said call his sister. While apparently in the stepdads side if the family group chat step sister told them to not pick up her kids so they all say no. While im in aton of pain as my while body is still sore and aches. So i called the cops and gave the kids to them. While next morning i get a calm of her furious because she has to pass a piss test and she had been doing drugs all night. So now all of stepdads family is nonstop calling. So AITA for calling the cops? Info to add it is my main hand that is broken the reason the cops didnt take me is because my neighbor was there and my aunt was on her way to pick me up as our parents had left the morning off. Also my stepdad is not against me and infact agreed with me MAJOR UPDATE im safe at my aunts house and the rung turns out a few cousins went and they stole the grom witch had minor damage so $3600 and my sur ron light bee $5200 cops are looking for them will update when found. Edit 2 the grom is home 2 out of the 3 cousins where arrested the 3rd has my sur ron and said he would end it so the cops are going at this at differently than they would normally, still getting aton of messages and calls but just keep ignoring step sis had cocaine on her. Also really sorry for all the typos hand hurts and the meds anyway. UPDATE  back home and aunts here who is ex military so im not worried about safety. Alot of family from stepdads side are coming forward kissing my ass saying there sorry and blah blah blah looks like the 2 cousins will be facing up to 10 years in prison for stealing my shit. Step dad gets home at 3:00am while update then or if anything else happens.", "created_utc": 1689881729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1550uax/aita_for_telling_the_cops_my_stepsisters_kids_are/", "score": 374, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Insane to me that not a single adult in this situation stepped in to say this isn't okay. I don't this its cool to get cops involved, but you did try a number of other avenues first so I don't see what else you could have done. Incredibly irresponsible of her.", "I'm going with nta. You were in an accident and need to recover. Also, she never asked you to watch them herself, so that's her fault. To tell her family not to pick them up is messed up, and you did warn her.", "NTA - she left a 14 year old in charge of 4 kids so she can hang out with friends and do drugs. You absolutely did the right thing!!!  Your family has no right to come at you like they are.  They are doing this to deflect from the fact that this is going to make THEM(not you, OP) look bad.

And they get paid for that and have the right to refuse. \nImposing you to do that even if you were in super good health is wrong, doing so without informing you while you are recovering from an accident is triply wrong. \n\nYou even had the decency to offer her four hours to come back and told her you would call the cops, which is super polite regarding how she treats you.\n\nShe fails as a mother and as a sister.\n\nWhat you did will guarantee you won\u2019t be put in that situation again, good for you!\n\nHave a great recovery and good luck for not taking any of her BS.", "NTA your stepsister is a terrible and negligent parent. At no time should a 14 year old with a broken hand be left in charge of four young kids without appropriate discussion and agreement. \n\nKeep calling the police on her. Use birth control.

You abandoned them\n Repeat\n\nGood luck", "NTA. You did the best you could, probably should have called sooner than 7 hours after she took off.

That was really a dick move your stepsister pulled. How, exactly were you supposed to care for a 2 y/old (who might still need diapers) or any other child with a broken hand?
