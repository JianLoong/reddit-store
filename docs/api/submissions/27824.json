Procuring new frames were a deal breaker. Insurance reimbursed $110 which can only be used one time per year (articulated to wife). Those lenses were 'transition glasses' and could convert to sunglasses. When she brought home the bill I explained she should have waited to make a decision since I knew of cheaper options through coworkers. Eyebuydirect and Zenni Optical, which I had used previously for blue light filtering glasses at around $30. It resulted in a small argument about how important vision is (she has extremely poor vision in one eye) and we just let it settle.\r  \n\r  \nFast forward to today (September). She brings home another bill for $350 for another pair of lenses to be inserted into a separate pair of frames. She mentioned they were scratched and she wanted the blue light filter option as well. I told her we had this discussion recently and we could have bought them for a fraction of the cost online. I had just bought my own (first) pair about a month ago for $90 which had blue light filtering, transitioning, and a small case with a cloth through Zenni. She said she knew this frame fit her face to which I replied Zenni has a feature that will create a 3D model of your face, scan it and determine pupil distance to ensure a good fit (having just gone through this myself). It resulted in an argument about expenses and how she should not have to come to me before making any large purchase. She also pointed out that I bought an Xbox Series X and PS5 around launch time 3 years ago and that she gets more daily use out of her glasses than I do with those consoles, which is a fair point I guess. \r  \n\r  \nThe only other consideration is that she hasn't been working for the past 1.5 years and we have a toddler. We are now reliant on my income which does not match our double-salary at a previous location. She also cited her friends that spend hundreds on makeup and bags without having to disclose the expenses to their husbands in advance. In the examples she provided, those families also earn more than us to be fair. This is a combined total of $780 for glasses over 4 months. If I met the same baseline requirement (blue light filter, transition, new lens) we could have obtained 9 or so for that same price.

To protect what is left of our sight, we MUST get very precise measurements and properly aligned and fitted glasses, or risk losing our sight completely. \n\nIt's more expensive because it is more labor intensive. There is no cheaper way to do lenses for those with significant or specific types of vision impairment.\n\nJust so you can compare, in Canada/U.S. $730 for two pairs of glasses is CHEAP.\nMy lenses alone are over $500... and that's without taxes, fees, or frames.", "Yeah... yta\n\n>She said she knew this frame fit her face to which I replied Zenni has a feature that will create a 3D model of your face,\n\nThese aren't always reliable and the thing with trying on the glasses in store is youcan get a better feel for the frames and whether or not they are likely to irritate the ever loving fudge out of you. Just because they fit doesn't mean they're actually comfortable. I hate glasses that have built in nose pieces, I like the ones with the little nose pads as I find they're more comfy. Doesn't matter that the other sort fit my face, I just find them incredibly uncomfortable. \n\n>She also pointed out that I bought an Xbox Series X and PS5 around launch\n\nYou \"guess\" this is a good point? Your wife is investing money in something that helps her out in every day life and you think she might have a point that it had more value than your toys?\n\n>I had just bought my own (first) pair about a month ago for $90 which had blue light filtering, transitioning, and a small case with a cloth through Zenni.\n\nThis really shows. Talk to me after you've been wearing glasses for over 20 years and how irritating it is to find something reasonably comfortable and how devastating it can be to have to get new glasses because you know these frames work for you. \n\nAlso the higher your prescription the more likely it'll come out wrong in an online store.", "YTA\n\nLook, you're new to glasses so you just don't know yet.  But you're not listening to *her,* when she is experienced in these things, and that's a problem.\n\nFor glasses which must be worn at all times, the correct fit is so important.  These aren't weak prescription readers.  No, those online tools are *not* a replacement for having an optician properly measure you and make adjustments once everything comes in.  At the level my prescription is at these days, I wouldn't trust an online store to get it right anyway.  In fact, they might even reject it.\n\nYou think because she doesn't work that it's just not important that she have up-to-date, non-scratched lenses and properly fitting frames?  Really?  The ones she got are not even terribly expensive as glasses go, not when you have a strong prescription.\n\nBut it's definitely important for you to get $500 consoles without any discussion.\n\nAt the end of the day, while there is some style involved, this is a medical expense, and one she's experienced with.  Trust that she knows her needs.  You shouldn't need strangers on the internet to tell you the same things she's been trying to.", "YTA dude, your wife is vision impaired. She probably cannot see without the aide of this medical device. To echo what others are saying, the stronger the script the harder it is to find affordable options, even when shopping for shitty knockoffs online. Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet to get a good quality pair of glasses. If money is so tight why don't you sell one of your consoles so she can have her fucking glasses. You sound insufferable and childish. Her examples are out of touch but she should not even have to justify getting a pair of prescription glasses, that should be a part of the budget.", "YTA. Ask yourself how many hours you want to cut from your job and lifestyle to care for your toddler. Once you start nitpicking at your wife for spending too much as its your money,  while she's doing all the childcare, it's fair to say she's either going to expect a more 50/50 split so she can work, or she's going to leave you. This is glasses! I imagine there are a lot of things in those glasses that you aren't aware or when you are comparing them. With a strong prescription I bet she's paying for thinning, anti scratch etc. \nNitpicking and telling your wife she needs to check with you before she spends money was OK in the 1950s, not so good now.", "Yta   430.00 is cheap.", "If she has a high prescription, her glasses will be expensive anywhere as she will need to pay for lens thinning. So her price for one set of lenses is probably reasonable. Her need for two pairs of glasses within four months seems less reasonable, though.", "YTA. Zenni frames are crap. I\u2019ve bought them before and they simply do not match the quality or hold up as well as more expensive frames. They also fit terribly, despite all their website features. Not only that, but they take WEEKS sometimes to arrive, since they\u2019re coming from China. Secondly, if your wife has bad vision, it\u2019s always going to be the lenses that cost the most. It was the same with my husband until he got LASIK. Even using Zenni, the lenses he needed would\u2019ve still been a pretty penny. If I\u2019m spending that much for glasses, you bet your ass I want to know that they\u2019ll fit right and be a quality that\u2019s going to hold up.", "YTA. Her vision is poor.

Getting the right fit and the right lenses and making sure you take care of them properly and ensuring you have a backup pair.... leave your wife alone. I get that your income is down a bit, but unless $700 is going to make you homeless, leave her alone to get glasses that make her feel good and, ya know, help her SEE!", "YTA \n\nas a OD TECH myself I can honestly tell you those websites are S#%* . We have so many people who come to us for the prescriptions and go online and it almost always is messed up& they don\u2019t have any policy to redo them, your just put on the money and mostly end up with me again to fix it. in the world of glasses, you get what you pay for. Those measurements for PD are very important and especially if it is progressive, it has to be ACCURATE or you\u2019ll be all messed up& can cause more issues later. Finding a frame that fits and looks good is important, most people don\u2019t like picking online because even if it looks good you won\u2019t know for sure until it\u2019s there& a lot of online websites they don\u2019t have a return policy and even if they do, if they prescription is off by even a little it can cause issues. It saves ALOT by just doing it in person& majority of the in-person locations offer returns / remaking if anything is off& if it breaks we offer warranty for both lens and frames. Not to mention if anything is off we will redo your whole exam & remake for free. \n\nALSO she\u2019s right about the expensive consoles you got compared to her glasses, which she NEEDS while your consoles is a WANT. Do you not care if your wife can SEE properly while caring for your very young child? While she\u2019s driving ( if she drives ) or feeding/ doing things with them that requires good vision which is idk.. basically everything ? Lol I think you honestly feel a type of way because you are the only one with income, so you feel you have a right to comment on whatever she buys because in your eyes it\u2019s YOUR money\u2026 but she also is working & doesn\u2019t get a \u201c paycheck\u201d but I\u2019d take a wife wanting good glasses over one who loves to buy new bags/ makeup just because she wants them on \u201c your \u201c card. Vision is important, focus on how well your wife takes care of everything.. does she not deserve them? ( the right answer is yes, because everyone deserves glasses when they need them) apologized to your wife for overreacting because you definitely did. Maybe come up with a limit for frames / look out for promotions / deals going on for certain times of the year and try to schedule her appts then is the best advice I can give.  Now if this was about contacts I\u2019d say it wasn\u2019t as important, because it\u2019s way more to buy monthly/ yearly contacts over a paid of good glasses especially on a budget.\n\nEdit* contacts are a want not a need to me ( because while wearing contacts your eyes get no oxygen, and people tend to over wear them all day& only take it off at night & when your sleeping your eyes also don\u2019t get oxygen) so to me glasses are more important& the fact everyone can wear glasses and not everyone can wear contacts. \n\nThank you for listening to my Ted talk :)", "YTA- unfortunately cheap glasses like this don't work well for people with poor vision, especially in cases like astigmatism where special measurements need to be taken by hand. I have a severe astigmatism $200-300 is about what I pay for mine, without transition lenses or blue light filtering. Just a special night driving coating, damn those ultra bright headlights. That's including the decent insurance discount and taking extremely gentle care of the frames so they only have to be replaced every other year.\n\nMy boyfriend has mild vision issues and can use the cheap ones. However, he's had to replace his 2 or 3 times in the past year, when all I've done is have a screw replaced (which my optometrist office did for free). You get what you pay for, and with how expensive my lenses can be, I think the extra money up front for a sturdier frame that will last is worth it.\n\nGlasses for people with extremely poor vision are expensive.  This is just an expense you're going to have to live with.", "YTA.\n\nShe spent $780 for \\*two\\* medical aids -- which are what glasses are -- that she needs for everyday use.\n\nHow much were your \\*two\\* entertainment consoles that are a want, not a need?\n\nYou've gotten lucky with online glasses.

We don\u2019t have much money at the moment but the one thing we always have to budget for is paying for the new glasses, it is unavoidable.

You would probably freely pay this to fix a car, why not this?", "INFO: Did you run your gaming console purchases by your wife first?  \n\nFYI: In my experience, by the time you have a prescription strong/complex enough to need to spend $400 in person, they aren't significantly cheaper online (maybe $50).

Plus I use an entirely different pair of glasses at the computer, with blue block.  My husband used to be a lens cutter for Lens Crafters and was very skeptical of Zenni, et al at, the beginning, especially for bifocals (lined or progressive).  Like OP our ins. only covers 1frame per year.  So the last time we had ins. I got my bifocals at the expensive optometrists office (progressive, transition, anti-glare, scratch coating.) Got the cheapest frames that didn't make me look like a 70s 5th grader.  Over $400 with ins.   Took the opportunity to order my simple computer glasses from Zenni.  Used the frame selection tool to find a great frame blue blocker, anti-glare, anti-scratch.  $45 and arrived a week before my bifocals were ready.\n\nWhen the time came this summer to get new glasses again I went to a local optometrist for an exam and got copies of both prescriptions.  Got both pair from Zenni (progressive bifocals and computer glasses). Progressives were anti glare, anti scratch, grease repellent, deluxe field (bigger field of vision), computer were anti glare, blue-block, anti scratch, and 2 sets of clip-on sunglasses, with a case for each pair. Paid about $160 for both pair.\n\nThere were a TON of frames to choose from, and the selection tools work really well.   Love the frames, get them adjusted where I got the prescription, and get a discount next time I order.\n\nAnother tip:  On the bow of the glasses you already have/love are some numbers, one is the frame size.  Usually  between 130 -155.  if you always look at glasses that have a number very close to that, the frames you are trying will at least be a good fit width wise when you are looking/trying.\n\nEdit typo", "NTA I also buy from Zenni.

But a lot depends on your prescription. I could gamble getting lenses online that meet my prescription but it usually takes a lot of going back and forwards. I get transtition lenses not because I want sunglasses but because I have retinal damage and dry eyes and the transitions has UV protection that stops more damage. Basically sun cream for your eyes. And I am sold on the blue filter which is actually same cost where I am as basic lenses, coated in protective covering and thinned. It makes night driving a lot safer if astigimatic. And if you are reliant on glasses, ordering online seems to have longer lead times than ordering offline. \n\nAnd I go overboard on the frames for my primary pair as usually they last me 5 years - tintanium, light, thin, bendy and close to unbreakable. This is something I am going to be wearing every day for 5 years I want to be comfortable, I want them to last and I don't want them breaking if I stand on them. I've used same frames now for 20 years replacing them about 4 times. And if your wife is going back into workplace and interviewing, she may want to be confident she looks good.\n\nThat said, your financial situation has changed dramatically recently and it is natural that you cut back a bit on expenses. The primary pair I'd say she was justified on for reasons above. I do think she could have given online a try for a secondary pair if backup to main glasses. I've been tempted to give a shot but my secondary pair are for work so work pays for them and 50% of with main pair so savings limited. \n\nI  can see why you want to cut costs but I can also see why she might want to be comfortable with something that is such a fundamental part of her life. There are things to save money on, glasses I'm not sure are one of them. The consoles are a red herring - you bought them before your finances changed.

Procuring new frames were a deal breaker. Insurance reimbursed $110 which can only be used one time per year (articulated to wife). Those lenses were 'transition glasses' and could convert to sunglasses. When she brought home the bill I explained she should have waited to make a decision since I knew of cheaper options through coworkers. Eyebuydirect and Zenni Optical, which I had used previously for blue light filtering glasses at around $30. It resulted in a small argument about how important vision is (she has extremely poor vision in one eye) and we just let it settle.\r  \n\r  \nFast forward to today (September). She brings home another bill for $350 for another pair of lenses to be inserted into a separate pair of frames. She mentioned they were scratched and she wanted the blue light filter option as well. I told her we had this discussion recently and we could have bought them for a fraction of the cost online. I had just bought my own (first) pair about a month ago for $90 which had blue light filtering, transitioning, and a small case with a cloth through Zenni. She said she knew this frame fit her face to which I replied Zenni has a feature that will create a 3D model of your face, scan it and determine pupil distance to ensure a good fit (having just gone through this myself). It resulted in an argument about expenses and how she should not have to come to me before making any large purchase. She also pointed out that I bought an Xbox Series X and PS5 around launch time 3 years ago and that she gets more daily use out of her glasses than I do with those consoles, which is a fair point I guess. \r  \n\r  \nThe only other consideration is that she hasn't been working for the past 1.5 years and we have a toddler. We are now reliant on my income which does not match our double-salary at a previous location. She also cited her friends that spend hundreds on makeup and bags without having to disclose the expenses to their husbands in advance. In the examples she provided, those families also earn more than us to be fair. This is a combined total of $780 for glasses over 4 months. If I met the same baseline requirement (blue light filter, transition, new lens) we could have obtained 9 or so for that same price. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Thankfully i got cataract surgery, didn\u2019t have cataracts, but something with the glare factor (Don\u2019t understand that either lol).  \n\nI don\u2019t know how it goes online but I would have to get my glasses adjusted at least once every 2 to 3 months because glasses get bumped, get bent a little (if wire frames), with strong prescriptions they have to be in exact alignment.
