We're both still single, and I get the kids every other weekend. My daughter unfortunately had to have her left arm amputated due to cancer as a toddler, so now she has a prosthetic. \n\nOur daughter recently got in trouble in school, she helped several of her friends cheat on what's essentially the elementary school equivalent of final exams. This knocked their final grade down a letter, and got all of them suspended for two days plus three days detention. \n\nMy ex was punishing her, and just asked me to follow the basic guidelines if nothing else (No electronics, no hanging out with friends, yada yada) which was fine. When I went to pick the kids up Friday, I noticed my daughter didn't have her prosthetic. While she doesn't always wear it, she always takes it with her when she comes over. That was odd so I asked her what was up, and she told me her mother had taken it for the week.\n\nI was enraged, but kept it together at first. I went inside and told her mother to give me her arm, and she said fine, probably because I looked like I was about to have a coronary. As I was leaving I told her I was going to talk to my lawyer about having custody changed, and she followed me to the car and said I was trying to spoil the kids and this is why she's misbehaving.\n\nI lost it. I called her a terrible mother, and went into a bit of a frenzy. I cussed her out in front of the kids, I said if I had my way she'd never see them again, and said some other very colorful insults. By the time I left both the kids were crying, and we all felt terrible. I don't regret what I said, but maybe it was wrong for the kids to see it. Either way I decided not to punish my daughter at all for cheating, detention and not having an arm for four days was enough.", "created_utc": 1684059484, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13h8icc/aita_for_calling_my_ex_a_horrible_mother_and/", "score": 693, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In that OP prioritised his feelings above his children's well being. He already had the arm, he was next to the car, there was no reason to do go crazy in front of the children making them cry. This shit is really damaging, it causes fear.\n\nAnd yes, violence is not just physical.", "Multiple things can be traumatic at the same time.

This man didn't even know that his daughter was without her arm all week before he picked her up. He either didn't have any contact with her at all that week or it didn't upset her enough to say something before he showed up to pick her up. He's a crappy father. He didn't even discuss with the daughter how she felt about the punishment but instead flew off the handle and said in front of the kids that they were never going to see their primary (read only)  caretaker ever again. \n\nThe mom did a shitty thing, but she's the one there for the kids, not the father.", "What mighty logic, saying one thing is bad is saying another thing is not bad.   \nBoth things are bad, hence why they said everyone sucks.", "Nobody's saying he shouldn't have those emotions, but exploding in front of your kids isn't the way to do it.\n\nI still remember my dad doing the same thing and that was over 20 years ago - it doesn't matter how righteous you are, it still doesn't make for a good parental relationship.", "Answer me this - would you have allowed your kid to be abused for 4 days straight with no knowledge from you? Either this man doesn't bother talking to his kids at all when he doesn't have them (so only talks to them every other weekend) or the kids aren't comfortable talking to him about things that upset them or the daughter wasn't upset with her punishment. I don't see any other option here. \n\nMy oldest has a crap relationship with her father and I know about when he does something to upset her essentially as soon as it happens. I've driven over to pick her up after he escalated an incident and taken her home with me despite the custody agreement. \n\nYelling at your ex in front of your kids is bad enough. Saying that they will never see the kids again is going to be traumatic for the kids. He's an every other weekend Disney dad and mom is their primary care giver. You don't think that would be traumatic for the kids to think that if they leave with dad they might never see her again?", "The fact of the matter is that the daughter was already traumatized by the Ex and then him saying mean things to his Ex in front of the kids just added MORE trauma.

Mistakes will be made. If you encourage children to stop respecting a parent who is trying their best in good faith to do what is right by the kids, then you open the door for serious harm to those kids' psyches. Children need the security of a parebt they can trust to guide them even when that means punishing them.\n\nIf a parent is abusive or neglectful, then the loss of respect will come naturally over time. But this seems more like oblivious and overzealous parenting than outright abusive.\n\nBear in mind that there is a context of a broken home and pretty serious discipline issues in school.

He's abusive because he told the kids they will never see their mom again. \n\nI'm sure he'll fall off his high horse soon enough and that makes him an AH as well. He needs to be pushing for more shared custody and parenting classes for both of them. If this was the first abusive thing mom has done, then it needs addressed and they need to move on from it, not go nuclear.

The daughter didn't seem upset about having her arm taken away, definitely not to the degree where it's acceptable to tell the kids they will never see their primary caregiver again. \n\nI never said it was a lapse of judgment, I said it's wrong and she needs parenting classes. Lots of parents have horrible parenting decisions but can learn to be and do better by taking parenting classes. \n\nHaving been essentially kidnapped and held hostage by my father as a young child to try to force my mom to reconcile with him, the terror from thinking you might never see your primary caregiver again is something that will stay with you. \n\nThis man didn't even talk to his daughter to find out how she felt about the arm situation.

Threatening to take kids away from their primary caregiver is abuse when you say it to/ in front of the children. It's emotional abuse. \n\nIf he had just yelled at the mom that what she did want okay and stood up for his daughter, he'd probably get a pass from me. He didn't, though, he said she'd never see the kids again if he had his way. In front of his kids. The man who sees (and apparently only talks to) his kids twice a month said he was never going to let them see their mom again. So you know how terrifying that would be for a kid? *He* was the only one making either kid cry. \n\nHe's not been their parent up to this point, didn't bother actually talking to the mom about the incident before picking the kids up. Didn't even bother talking to the daughter about it. It sounds like the kids were more upset at the thought of never seeing mom again than the daughter was upset about her arm. His telling of the story makes her sound very nonchalant about it. \n\nI don't think that what the mom did was okay, but she's been their only parent and care giver for a decent period of time. It was absolutely abusive of him to make those threats in front of the kids. They will probably have some lingering anxiety from that incident for a while, especially the 8 year old. If that's the only abusive thing the mom has ever done (which we have to assume because this awesome dad would never let his kids live in an abusive household, right?), it's nuclear to suggest never letting her see her kids again. She needs parenting classes any effective punishments and needs to apologize to her daughter for the punishment she chose, but she's been the only one there for these kids.", "More mighty logic.  Saying two things are bad is saying that they are exactly equal in how bad they are.  \n\nJust because something worse happened does not negate some other bad thing.  \n\nThe victim of both these bad things is the kid.  First the mum stole her arm, then her dad scared her with a furious berserk rage attack which made her cry.  \n\nIt was in OPs power to not scare the kid, by going back inside to rant at the mother,  but he didn't, he made both his kids cry cos he could not control his anger properly.", "Absolutely.
