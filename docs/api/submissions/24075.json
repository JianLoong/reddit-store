{"id": 24075, "submission_id": "15kffyq", "title": "AITA for not attending my sibling's wedding after the entire family cut me out for no real reason?", "selftext": "My (33M) parents divorced when I was 17, I'm the eldest. We were pretty much always a dysfunctional family. My siblings and I were just about geeky enough to not wonder the streets and get into too much trouble when my parents were either working long hours or just napping and not caring about us. My mom made domestic abuse accusations against my dad, and made me testify against him. He got community hours, and he cut ties with the family around the divorce. I haven't seen or spoken to him since.\n\nI got a severe depression, realizing later through many therapy sessions it was due to my guilt, and it took me a few years to get more balanced and cut the meds. The depression led to cutting ties with the few friends I already had, and to this day I'm pretty lonely. My mom also cut ties with her parents (which later passed away), her sister and many other family members due to many unsound reasonings, so we were pretty isolated.\n\nFollowing the divorce, we continued as even more dysfunctional. I won't spill out all the details, but it wasn't great. Luckily, I started college, met a girl, moved out, got married and tried to keep in touch with my family as much as I could, although it didn't feel right, and part of me always wanted to cut ties, but I fought to keep in touch.\n\nWhen we had our firstborn, I happily told its name to my mom, and she reacted hysterically, saying it's a bad name and will ruin its future and that we must change it. I got really offended, and she reacted by refusing to apologize (even though I didn't even ask her to), and later she just stopped talking to me, along with my siblings who stopped talking to me too. Mind you, she just had her first grandchild, who was less than a week old, and she cut all ties altogether. I tried to get in touch for months through calls and texts, but nothing.\n\nLater, when we had a one-time phone call, she blamed it all on my wife, accusing her of hating my family. When in reality, my wife always tried to make us come together, even when I didn't want to. My mom blamed me for siding with my wife, and said they stopped talking to me due to my \"decision of being my wife's bit\\*h\". Even after they cut ties, my wife wanted to try to make it right but I prevented her, realizing it was a lost cause.\n\nNow, a few years later, with resurfaced depression and emotional damages from feeling like an orphan with living parents or at least an unwanted child, after many therapy sessions and self work and many issues I had of my own, I worked extremely hard to have a happy family of my own. Now one of my siblings are engaged to be married, and their fianc\u00e9e invited me to their wedding. They haven't spoken to me since I became a parent a few years ago, along with the rest of the family.\n\nI'm fearing falling back into depression after I got it together, and I honestly don't want to see or talk to any of them. I suspect they invited me only to appear as a more normal family.

You built your life with the people who you want around. People who love and support you. You didn\u2019t get to choose your bio family but you did get to build your family and create the world you want to live in. They haven\u2019t spoken to you in years, why would they start now? And just keep things separate. \n\nYOU DO NOT OWE ABUSIVE PEOPLE ACCESS TO YOU WHEN THEY HARM YOU!!! \n\nNO ONE IS OWED ACCESS TO YOUR TIME EFFORT AND ENERGY IF THEY DONT EARN AND RESPECT IT.", "I'm all NTA, but you and your therapist should be tight on this one. A couple of visits in order to process your thinking with an objective listener seem appropriate.", "NTA they cut you off. Thank the fianc\u00e9 for the invitation, tell them they cut you off years ago and you are unwilling to undo all the mental health improvements at this time", "NTA\n\nCompletely understandable that you wouldn't want to be around your toxic family.  Just respond to the invitation that you won't be attending.\n\nCurious.  Why do you feel such guilt for testifying against your father?  Were you coerced into making false statements against your dad to support your mom's domestic violence allegations?", "NTA I would just politely decline and send well wishes. Sounds like your mum is toxic as. \n\nJust curious if you have ever tried to reconnect with your dad?", "Hmm that siblings was also toxic before? Or was it just mom. Well if you would go and rest of family will be there, be prepared for more BS.", "NTA. What the ever-loving eff. You\u2019ve worked so hard to be as emotionally stable and happy as you are, don\u2019t ruin it because of these people who cut you off over a name. It won\u2019t be a good time and just opens the door for your mother to draw you in to more drama. The only thing that ties you to this particular group of people is an accident of birth. Focus on the people that you have chosen to have in your life, instead.", "NTA. Your mother seems to be the root cause of a lot of the issues. She made you testify against your father with allegations of abuse, was he actually abusive? Is she doing to you what she did to him? She mocked your child's name and according to your story, hasn't made any effort to be a part of your child's life.\n\nIf I were you, I'd politely decline attendance at this wedding, and focus on yourself and your family. You seem to be a work in progress and attending the wedding may set your progress back a bit if you're not emotionally solid. \n\nDo what's best for you. Good luck", "NTA --- It's an invitation, not a summons and if it doesn't feel right for you to go then don't.", "NTA", "NTA. Don't go. They didn't treat you as family.\n\nOr if you want and feel stable enough, tell your sibling you want to meet him/her first in person to talk about what happened. MAybe it could be a change to reconect. Maybe it is a lost cause, but then you know before the wedding and you don't have to go.\n\nBut if you think, meeting them will trigger your depression. Or you just feel like it's not a good idea. Don't do it. You don't have to meet them, just because you are family. Sometime the family you choose is more important and better for you, than the one you were born into.", "I would also strongly suggest you listen to your gut instinct as it knows what your head is still processing. If your first instinct was no then dont go but I would sit down and write out all your reasons not to go and then reasons to go. Take this to your therapist and go through each one to clarify your feelings, emotions and anxieties. Good luck", "It's sad that OP has had to deal with so much trauma and too many toxic people in his life. NTAH if you don't attend your siblings' wedding. You do whatever you need to do for your own positive mental health needs. Keep the toxic family out. Also, your wife should respect and accept your decision to have no contact with your family.", "An invitation is not a demand for attendance.  Simply send your regrets with no explanation.   Just check the no box.   IF you want, send a token gift.   I\u2019ve found that when you anticipate negative reactions from people, like your family because you declined the demand of your presence, then a gift can be used as the \u201cWe couldn\u2019t attend the wedding, but wish the couple well and sent a gift\u201d.    You aren\u2019t ignoring them, aren\u2019t being rude, just have a conflict that day.  \n\nOr say no and don\u2019t send a gift.  Do what your conscious tells you.", "Oh, this is an easy one.  Wedding are 100% not the venue for a reconciliation.  There's a lot of work they have to do including a proper apology to get back into your life.  And that's assuming you want them to.\n\nProtecting your mental health is also not just about you but about protecting your family.  You have a wife and child to look after and they have you to look after.\n\nNTA. Don't go and don't think twice about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And I'm a bit worried that all the progress you've made will unravel if you go to the wedding. \n\nYou need to take the decision that's best for you, not for your \"family\".

I dont envy you. Maybe you could try it, i mean maybe she regret how she acted towards you.

Based on that you can attend to wedding or not.\n\nAnyway, you have your own family now, wife and kid. No matter what she will say will change that. You dont need therapy, you have support from your family now, so dont let her to get under your skin if she will bring up some BS again.", "I'm not sure I even want to make peace, or her apology. I just want to live in quiet without all their drama."]}
