We were pretty much always a dysfunctional family. My siblings and I were just about geeky enough to not wonder the streets and get into too much trouble when my parents were either working long hours or just napping and not caring about us. My mom made domestic abuse accusations against my dad, and made me testify against him. He got community hours, and he cut ties with the family around the divorce. I haven't seen or spoken to him since.\n\nI got a severe depression, realizing later through many therapy sessions it was due to my guilt, and it took me a few years to get more balanced and cut the meds. The depression led to cutting ties with the few friends I already had, and to this day I'm pretty lonely. My mom also cut ties with her parents (which later passed away), her sister and many other family members due to many unsound reasonings, so we were pretty isolated.\n\nFollowing the divorce, we continued as even more dysfunctional. I won't spill out all the details, but it wasn't great. Luckily, I started college, met a girl, moved out, got married and tried to keep in touch with my family as much as I could, although it didn't feel right, and part of me always wanted to cut ties, but I fought to keep in touch.\n\nWhen we had our firstborn, I happily told its name to my mom, and she reacted hysterically, saying it's a bad name and will ruin its future and that we must change it. I got really offended, and she reacted by refusing to apologize (even though I didn't even ask her to), and later she just stopped talking to me, along with my siblings who stopped talking to me too. Mind you, she just had her first grandchild, who was less than a week old, and she cut all ties altogether. I tried to get in touch for months through calls and texts, but nothing.\n\nLater, when we had a one-time phone call, she blamed it all on my wife, accusing her of hating my family. When in reality, my wife always tried to make us come together, even when I didn't want to. My mom blamed me for siding with my wife, and said they stopped talking to me due to my \"decision of being my wife's bit\\*h\". Even after they cut ties, my wife wanted to try to make it right but I prevented her, realizing it was a lost cause.\n\nNow, a few years later, with resurfaced depression and emotional damages from feeling like an orphan with living parents or at least an unwanted child, after many therapy sessions and self work and many issues I had of my own, I worked extremely hard to have a happy family of my own. Now one of my siblings are engaged to be married, and their fianc\u00e9e invited me to their wedding. They haven't spoken to me since I became a parent a few years ago, along with the rest of the family.\n\nI'm fearing falling back into depression after I got it together, and I honestly don't want to see or talk to any of them. I suspect they invited me only to appear as a more normal family.

And above all, realizing it wasn't my fault.", "I got no other explanation besides the one I mentioned, that my wife \"hates\" them.", "That\u2019s worth mentioning. \n\nBecause while obviously NTA, and your mother is insane, when I read the OP I was left wondering, what was the name?\n\n\u201cHi Mum! I\u2019d like to introduce you to you first beautiful, beloved granddaughter: Jane Holocaustdidnthappen Smith!\u201d", "Did you consider the fiancee is probably doing the same thing your wife did? People who don't grow up in dysfunctional families really don't understand how bad it can get and will often push people who know better, to try to get them to reconcile. Your sibling probably said not to bother but the fiancee is all sunshine and roses about \"family.\"", "That's understandable - though it might offer some closure or healing if you write him a heartfelt apology. Wishing you the best.", "Lol", "Didn't know they existed. Probably started dating after they cut me out.", "Sounds really reasonable as my wife comes from a great family.", "I think so too.", "that was my thought, women marrying into the family trying to mend fences. a wedding being a good time for it, but if op doesn't want to risk it, then it's ok. it's his life and the attempt is just too late.", "I'm kind of wondering if your sibling is re-thinking how the past happened, given they were younger than you and were likely subject to the same manipulation from your mom that you were. An invitation to a wedding could be their attempt at a peace offering. If you don't want to talk to your family, maybe reach out to the fiance and see why you were sent the invitation.", "I'd take this into consideration, buy a nice little gift and say, \n\nThanks I'm happy for you but I'll stay away because I'm happy where I am. Congrats!\n\nDead Silence is also a good option but personally I'd feel more guilt doing that then just politely saying I'm happy you are happy, leave me alone.", "NTA\n\nYour mom sounds so toxic it\u2019s not safe to even breathe the same air.  Just stay away. Send a card and a small gift if you want to leave some door open to your sibling but no you\u2019re better off keeping away. I wish you health and healing.  Your wife sounds lovely.  Enjoy your life with your new family.", "NTA  Do not go they will just do the same shit they always do.  YOU and your family need not be a part of that nightmare.  I am happy that you are where you want to be in life and wish you continued happiness", "They're just wedding gift farming. Set the invitation on fire, flush the ashes, and do you best to forget they ever existed. Put your time and energy into your current, non-toxic family (i.e. wife and kids). NTA.", "NTA. It sounds like you will be much happier if you just walk away from all of them!", "Nta. Do not go. You have no reason to want to be a part of these peoples lives. They're terribly toxic", ">their fianc\u00e9e invited me\n\nYour sibling didnt invite you - they might not know you are invited - this isn't a real invitation but the fiancee trying to be nice and get everyone together not knowing the background. If your sibling or family wanted you there truly they'd have reached out but didn't.\n\nDon't go - why do you need them - you don't do you - you have a partner, you have a child - they are your family. Add more people to your family via friends you choose. But you don't need more than what you have.

Prioritize yourself, unapologetically! :)", "Your mom is a narcissist. She excluded you from your family. She shows signs of abusing you mentally/psychologically. I understand it\u2019s painful and you may miss them but I believe your peace and wellbeing is more important than your relationship with toxic, abusive and dysfunctional people. I also would ask you would you ever allow your child to be a part of that because the answer should be no. NTA.

You can either ignore the invitation or if you want to be polite, decline with no explanation. Also no need for a present.", "No. My dad was a going out for cigarettes and milk and never came back. I did not have contact with him for 20 years. He ended up getting sober, (good for him), but I was one of his steps. I had done my therapy and worked through all the shit. I was at a good place in my life.  My sister begged me to go to dinner and hear him out and against my better judgment I went. \n\nI ended up right back at the beginning. He died last year. My sister again begged me to come and I said no this time. It was a good decision.", "NTA - Did you ever think that your Dad walked away because your mom is problematic ? She does sound a bit unbalanced from the little info you have provided. Kudos to you for fighting so hard to build a positive life!", "You do what is best for you.

You don\u2019t need them in your life. They will only make your life worse. They will never change. You fucked up by bearing false witness against your father and driving him away.

You better hope your own child doesn\u2019t pay you back in the same way you did your own father.", "NTA\n\nResist the gift grab and do not attend.

Until they take ownership of what they did to you I would have nothing to do with any of them.", "Eye roll. This post is all about you being the victim. I would love to know who your siblings feel. There is way more to this story. I would agree your mother sucks, but I'm not going to say you siblings suck. You talk about your life but never discuss what crap they went through it's all about you. I would not invite you to my wedding either. Maybe you need more therapy. Maybe to talk to your siblings instead of just enjoying being the victim.", "NTA. If (and only if) your sister's fiance invites you to a one-on-one (coffee, a beer, etc.) to get acquainted, and keeps it one-on-one, and makes it clear you are valued--and safe--to attend, then (and only then) you might reconsider. But watch out for ambushes!!", "NTA. \n\nThey obviously enjoy controlling and manipulating through emotion and you got out. As much as it hurts to cut family out - even the toxic members - it's for the better.

So they ask their fianc\u00e9 to reach out because they are to scared to. Now NTA for not going to the wedding.

If the rest of your family will be there i think it would only cause you stress and truma and most likely undo all the work you have done.", "NTA.  Your mom is evil. Coercing you to lie under oath is beyond the pale.  You have a duty as a parent to keep her the hell away from your kids.\n\nI do think you need to make amends to your father.

Writing a long letter or message would allow you to apologise while staying far enough away to lessen the fear of it all\n\nHonestly the entire thing is shite (and one of the main things is that you shouldn\u2019t go and you should prioritise yourself there). But it seems from what you said that your father, though not perfect, absolutely didn\u2019t deserve what happened. It appears that your mother manipulated you horribly and as a result he was arseholed into oblivion."]}
