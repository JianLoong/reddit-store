All this during my vacation with my kids.

Is it an urban or rural area?\n\nDepending on the answer (especially if you\u2019re a considerable time/distance away) it\u2019s probably worth sitting down with your son and asking him what arrangements he and/or his mother have made to get him to the airport.\n\nPublic transport will have reduced schedules. Taxis/ubers will be more expensive on the day and will probably need pre-booking.\n\nTreat him as an adult and tell him you understand if he does want to go, but explain that as you\u2019ll be busy with the rest of the family, it won\u2019t be your (or any other family members) responsibility to get him there, especially if it means driving a few hours to the airport and then a few hours back. The planning and expense is not for you to worry about.", "He absolutely will if his mother keeps poisoning him against his father by doing manipulative bullshit like this. This is her goal.", "Not to mention, and I'm sorry to Op for even mentioning this, if Grandma doesn't make it to next Christmas your ex has literally robbed your son of the chance to see his grandma one last time.\n\nAnd I'll speak from experience and regret, I worked through the last trip I could've taken to see both my great grandparents before they passed, I thought I'd have more time, at least one more trip down there.\n\nBut instead I had to say my last words to them at the casket.", "NTA, ex, is just trying to stir the pot and create problems between you and your son. If he pushes back on this, the best thing to do is tell him it's his decision, but he has to get himself to the airport and explain to everyone why he's bouncing early.

Petty, sneaky, underhanded and manipulative at zero risk to herself. Checks all the boxes!", "This!!", "Bro it\u2019s one Christmas. Can\u2019t he just visit his GF for new years?", "Situations have nuance.

I'm what world do children get to make the plans. There are negotiational plans and non-negotiaonal plans. This is the latter. The kid can visit the gf another time.

I had a LD bf at 17 and my parents would have LAUGHED in my FACE if I even joked about spending a major holiday with him instead of with my family.

That 18 year olds can't either,  and parenting is about respecting children's decisions and showing them in what form respect takes. \n\nRespecting an 8 year old's decision not to wear pants involves explaining the social and legal requirements and getting them a sarong if they truly insist.  \n\nRespecting a 26  year old who wants to change Christmas plans last minute involves laying out the cost involved, financial and social.  \n\nA 17 year old is somewhere between those. \n\nBut \"he is not yet 18\" makes it sound like he's raising an 8 year old at 17 who thinks they will have no repercussions once they are 18, and as if dad thinks so too.

This doesn't feel any different.\n\nThe difference to me in this situation is that A) any objection 17 had to the plans, he had nearly a whole year to voice them. B) albeit could be missing info, but as far as we are informed, 17 doesn't have a problem with the family that is trying to come together.  If there's issues, then yeah, kind of shitty to force him to see em, but if its just that he wants to see his girlfriend for the holiday season, there is always the day after to fly out.

When I was the same age I made a very similar decision in reference to my great grandmother and she passed before I saw her again. I regret it to this day and I'm 40 now. That's why as the parent, Dad gets this call until his son is 18. \n\nI have to guess you're also young to have such an opinion, but there's a reason legally the parents still have the say when they're under 18 and the parents have custody arrangements. In what world did you grow up where you got to dictate to your parents what your plans would be when they already had major family events or holidays going on? Are you intending to raise your kids in a way where you're a slave to their desires? Wish you the best but prepare for the worst m8."]}
