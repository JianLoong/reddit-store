She does not like me, and does not communicate with me.\n\nMy son is 17 and has a girlfriend he has seen multiple times through travel (visiting each other). They've been GF/BF (long distance) for a year. She's great. He's great. About 1200 miles of distance.\n\nThis Christmas, I had a planned vacation with my kids (3 boys, 17yo is the middle child) to visit his 84 year old grandmother (my mom) and extended family (uncle/aunt/cousins) who have all planned on being together on Christmas Day. These plans have been in the works for months upon months. His uncle is driving 12 hours just to be there on Christmas Day as a surprise for grandma. His cousins shuffled their plans so we could all see each other and spend time together. My mother is 84 and showing the age, and her only wish was to have everyone there on Christmas Day. She is dramatic, but also convinced she doesn't have many Christmases left. She has been begging to be with her grandkids on Christmas Day for the last year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere comes the fun part.\n\nMy ex talked with my son who revealed a typical 17 year-olds desire to see his girlfriend on Christmas, and the ex decided to call his girlfriend's mom and arrange for his girlfriend's grandmother to purchase plane tickets for him to fly out to see his GF early Christmas afternoon as a surprise.\n\nWe are driving 300 miles to see my family during a week-long vacation, Christmas is the only day where we can all be together. He'll have to bail for the airport at 2pm to catch his flight. \n\nChristmas. Day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy ex did not tell me she was doing this until AFTER the girlfriend's grandmother paid for the tickets. My son didn't inform me that they were talking about a flight on Christmas Day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen the ex sent me an email, saying this was the new plan, and I had to \"respect his decision.\" He is not yet 18.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo without saying a word to me, she helped him book a flight to see his girlfriend halfway across the country, on the one day everyone made plans to be together, and got the girlfriends grandmother to pay for it, because they wanted to surprise her on Christmas with her boyfriend (my son) showing up. All this during my vacation with my kids. I refused the idea, and told her to fix the mess that she created, and that this behind-the-back move was appalling, offensive, and grotesque and she should be ashamed of herself for interjecting into my time with my kids without communicating with me.\n\nI also told her to call the GFs mom, and fix this disaster by re-booking the flight.\n\nVerdict? \n\nAITA for putting my foot down and calling out her bad behavior but also denying my son a Christmas Day trip to see his GF (for the record, I told him that if he wanted to fly a day or two later, I'd happily take him to the airport, but Christmas was off limits and non-negotiable).  \n\n\nHelp me with your sanity, please, I feel like everyone has been taking crazy pills.", "created_utc": 1700660697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1819g4g/aita_for_calling_my_exs_behavior_offensive_and/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Explain why these plans are so important and why this last minute change doesn't work. If possible do it without throwing your EX under the bus but he's old enough to know the truth. What she did was really shitty and very underhanded. Hopefully your son lives his grandmother and will understand why this trip is important.

Of course he's going to want to see his gf every chance he gets. Duh. He's 17. That's what teenagers do. The ex is a bit of a cuntnugget because she obviously did this on purpose to fuck you over.

In what universe does a child get a veto or say as to what is happening during a holiday? All kids will get to make decisions about their life soon; doesn\u2019t mean the timeline needs to be accelerated. \n\nWhat lesson is your interpretation imparting to the 17-year old?

Kid acts like a kid - don\u2019t treat him like an adult (communication is really lacking here). And the OP is *not* the person failing to communicate. \n\nYes, the kid is growing up.
