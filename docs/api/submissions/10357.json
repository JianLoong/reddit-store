I know it doesn't sound great but please read and understand the whole thing.\n\nMy (46f) parents divorced when I was young and they both remarried. I also have two half sisters from dad's first marriage. Bottom line, I have a lot of siblings. While I do try and keep in touch, I'm not close to all of them.\n\nThis post is mainly about my half sister who I'll call Catherine (63f). As I mentioned me and Catherine talk, but we're not extremely close and never was growing up. She also lives in a different country now so don't get to see each other much.\n\nMy daughter Annie (23f) was engaged to her boyfriend of 6 years and the wedding meant to happen this summer, but she found out he was cheating with one of her close friends. Obviously she isn't doing so well and I hate to see her like this, so I suggested we take a girls trip to LA (where she was supposed to go on honeymoon). This trip is just me and my three daughters. This cheered Annie up a bit and she's really been looking forward to it. We've already booked everything.\n\nThere's been a family tragedy with Catherine's son and his partner. This is awful news and we're all hurting. The funeral is the week of our trip, and it's also not like I can just delay the trip a day because I'll be flying there and flying back. I also know Annie's really been looking forward to this and I don't want her to be even more upset.\n\nI did talk to Catherine and told her I'm really sorry, but I can't make it to the funeral, but I'll video call in. Catherine got very upset with me and hung up.\n\nSome of my other siblings are saying I should be going to the funeral and I'm not being supportive.", "created_utc": 1676810661, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1169fgy/aita_for_missing_my_nephews_funeral_to_go_on_a/", "score": 944, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're the asshole. Your sister lost a child and you won't go to the funeral? You said in a comment that you could push the vacation back but chose not to.\n\nHow mad would you be if Catherine didn't go to Annie's funeral?", "YTA OP\n\nSeriously I personally can't believe you would even think about this for a second?\n\nYour nephew is gone. He won't ever come back while you can postpone this trip.\n\nGo postpone this trip and get yourself to your sister and support her. You daughter won't die if the trip is postponed\n\nFor everyone saying N T A let me make a few things clear, Here are OP's comments:\n\n>**I know she would come to one of my children's funerals (God forbid), but I don't think that's a fair comparison. She's much older than me and always had the protective sister thing going on, where she would do things for her siblings whether she wanted to or not.**  \n>  \n>**And yes this isn't really about me, it's about Annie, and she doesn't want to postpone**\n\nHold on you expect her to come to your kid's funeral but you can't go to hers? I said it once I said it again Annie wont die just because her trip was delayed. Seriously there are more people who have gone though something like her and they are doing fine.\n\n>**I did know my nephew of course well enough, and we were all invited to his wedding next year. But my daughters weren't that close to him because he was significantly older than them**\n\nWhy does your daughters not being close to them even important? He's still your nephew. \n\n>**We technically can push it back a couple of weeks, but Annie doesn't want to do that. She's already been through a lot and I don't want to have to tell her we have to postpone the trip**\n\nI said it twice, I'll say it again Annie wont die if her trip is postponed.\n\nI hope your sister goes NC with you. The only reason I haven't said I hope something similar happens to you is because I know the pain and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.", "\"also not like I can just delay the trip a day \"\n\nExcuses, excuses.\n\nYTA OP.", "NTA. This may sound harsh but you're not oblige to attend and your daughter needs your support, as a mother you prioritized her and I don't see anything wrong. Your siblings must understand you for choosing your daughters over your nephew's funeral.", "Question: the funeral is on the trip to LA week and you cannot come, fine. Will it be possible for you go to visit your sis family before the funeral then and see your nephew for the last time? How hard is it for you to go from your location to your sis location and then to LA? Just would like to understand more.", "You understand that your relationship with you sister is over forever, right?  There will be no coming back from this.  Y\u2019all are done.", "YTA\n\nNo sorry, this is pathetic. I get Annie's hurting, having a partner cheat on you is definitely awful. But all these other comments acting like they *need* to go on a trip to LA right this moment and can't postpone it by a week? Her daughter's health will deteriorate that much if they slightly push a trip back? OP commented they could push it back, but don't want to:\n\n*We technically can push it back a couple of weeks, but Annie doesn't want to do that. She's already been through a lot and I don't want to have to tell her we have to postpone the trip*\n\nCatherine hasn't been through a lot OP? Losing her own damn son and her future daughter in law? This comment from OP:\n\n*I know she would come to one of my children's funerals (God forbid), but I don't think that's a fair comparison. She's much older than me and always had the protective sister thing going on, where she would do things for her siblings whether she wanted to or not.*\n\nRight, so Catherine would drop everything to come to one of your children's funerals but you don't think it's a fair comparison because \"she's much older than me\". Then this:\n\n*I did know my nephew of course well enough, and we were all invited to his wedding next year. But my daughters weren't that close to him because he was significantly older than them*\n\nIt honestly sounds like to me OP would go, but her daughter doesn't want to postpone by a week. If that's the case OP, please teach your daughter some empathy. She's 23. \n\nI'm not trying to downplay how difficult it is to break up with your fiance, but for fuck's sake, try to understand. \n\nYour nephew isn't having a wedding either because he and his partner are both fucking dead.", "YTA. You are not \u201cobligated\u201d to go to the funeral, however, what a lot of redditors don\u2019t understand is when you\u2019re part of a family you sometimes do things you might not want to in order to support them when tragedies happen. It sucks your daughter got cheated on, but your nephew and his partner DIED. Whether or not you\u2019re close to your half sister, you should support her in what is likely the hardest time in her life, losing her child. If you have zero feelings or empathy then go ahead and take your daughter on vacation, but expect consequences for your actions.", "YTA. If your daughter died and and a family member ditched the funeral to go on a trip how would you feel?", "YTA. \n\nIt's great, and sweet that you want to support your daughter through this shocking and painful time; that you want to do something to cheer her up. But, a trip can be postponed and rescheduled. And I get that you're not super close with your sister.\n\nBut someone died.\n\nA funeral only happens once. They can't reschedule the funeral around you. By her reaction, it sounds like your sister is in need of your love and support right now too. And that she was really hoping that you'd be there for the services, and for her during this soul-crushing grief-filled time. And that's where my vote comes in.", "YTA.  There are a lot of different factors in funerals.  There is a difference of a grandparent dies, or a grandchild.  Dipping out on the funeral of an elderly person whose died naturally after a long life is one thing.  But this is someone younger than you; the funeral would take precedence.\n\nIt's not a clear-cut case one way or the other, and I'm sure people will forgive you if you go on the trip anyway.  It's not the worst asshole thing ever, but it still counts as y t a.", "I have a feeling you know YTA! I hope you are ready to have the majority of your family treat you like crap for the next handful of years because that's what you just walked into. You've done nothing but make excuses in your comments which shows that you obviously did not care at all about your nephew. Your sister lost a child and needs the support of her family whereas your daughter's fiance stepped out on her with another person. There is no comparison there. Your daughter will get over that in time whereas your sister will never get over the loss of her child. You're a selfish asshole and so is your daughter. I hope you weren't planning on spending any holidays this year with your family cuz I have a feeling you're not going to be invited. \n\nYTA", "You can\u2019t rebook for your nephew\u2019s **funeral**? And was his partner also killed?\n\nYes, YTA.", "YTA because you admit that 1) you could push back the trip to LA but don't want to do it because your daughter doesn't want to, 2) your relationship with your sister is close enough that she would attend a funeral if the roles were reversed, 3) money does not seem to be a limiting factor in your ability to travel to the funeral. \n\nYour decision to not attend seems to boil down to the fact that it would inconvenient because your daughter doesn't want to change the date of your girls trip.\n\nMaybe it would help your daughter if she were to attend the funeral with you, put her breakup into perspective and reconnect with extended family.", "YTA. \n\nSometimes people are in a situation where it is absolutely impossible to be at two important family events simultaneously. This, is not that. What is the irreparable harm by delaying the trip a week to attend the funeral? Yes, Annie is justifiably sad and upset, but really what's the harm in rescheduling by a few days?\n\nThe harm of not going to your nephew's funeral is the death of your relationship with your sister on top of that loss. She just lost her son and his partner. She's devastated. Don't look for understanding there, she has her own grief to manage and killing your relationship with her at this moment by not going is another burden you're putting on her. Unkind, and you're justifying it because you are blessed with an overabundance of family and don't have a particularly close relationship with her. Other people in your family are going to be disgusted with you over this too, so anticipate a ripple effect beyond the relationship you're willing to sacrifice.\n\nThis doesn't have to be an either/or situation. Moving the trip might be a pain in the butt, however it's possible; you're not cancelling the trip and surely if Annie is reasonable she will understand a short delay for a death in the family - unforeseen circumstances causing a change in plans. You can actually split the baby here. Why aren't you?", "Did you get travel insurance? If so, rescheduling your trip should be quick and easy with a copy of the death certificate. Often just a picture of it will do. Even if you *didn't* get the insurance, most airlines will provide refunds or not charge change fees for a death in the family. The process is just more onerous.\n\nYTA because there was a relatively easy solution to this problem.", "YTA\n\nYour clearly not hurting that much by it or it would be a priority to attend. You\u2019ve said you could push the trip back so there is literally no excuse. \n\nPut your self in your sisters shoes, how would you feel if the roles were reversed?", "YTA. This really just seems as though you would rather enjoy a girls' trip, and has very little to do with Annie at all.\n\nThe woman lost her child. Annie broke off a relationship that obviously wasn't going to be a healthy one had it continued on. The situations are hardly comparable. Especially given the fact that Catherine moved away to a different country. I assume that also means she doesn't have an extended family network she can lean on close by.\n\nYou said the trip is for the four of you. The easiest solution seems to be just having your three daughters enjoy the trip, while you go to the funeral. \n\nYour daughter is old enough to know why a funeral is more important than a cheer-me-up trip, so I don't really see how she could make a fuss over it?", "I get that your daughter is devastated about her wedding being off because she was cheated on. I get that the trip was already paid for. That stinks. However, consider your sister\u2019s feelings. How devastated is she that her son is dead? Your daughter will date again and probably get married someday. Your sister won\u2019t get her son back. She needs you, and I\u2019m sorry to say it\u2019s more than your daughter does after a breakup. YTA. You can plan another trip to LA, and this would teach your daughter something. What it\u2019s teaching her now is that funerals don\u2019t matter, weddings are more important, and it\u2019s okay that your grieving sister might not talk to you anymore after this.", "I was on nah till you said you know him well and was going to attend his wedding next year. You can postpone the trip, annie will get over it.", "YTA: She's being spoiled, she doesn't want to postpone a girls trip for a FUNERAL? Someone is died and it's a heartless not to go.", "I'm not close to my siblings my siblings either.  They all communicate with each other more often than I do.  With that said, if they had a child pass away, I would go to the funeral, at the very least, out of responsibility.  Hard to say that you are the AH because I don't think anybody can judge another's relationship with their family, but I will have to go with a very soft YTA.  Also, if your daughter doesn't support postponing the trip for her cousin's funeral, I would question that as well.", "Yta bc you say the trip *can* be postponed.  It's not trip OR funeral. \n\nI mean, you can def not postpone the trip, but you need to understand you will 100% be damaging your relationships with the vast majority of your family.", "YTA\n\nNormally yes, the feelings of your daughters are more important. But you are an AH for having a great time with your daughters and your sister is grieving in pain and asks you to be at her side. How would you feel, when it would be the funeral of one of your kids and your family would be like \"Sorry, but we want to have some nice family trip instead\"\n\nYou do not attend the funeral for your nephew, you attend for the support of the living family members.\n\nI wonder if you checked all options: How long is the flight between your trip location and the funeral? Your daughters could fly without you, you could join later or maybe travel back and forth or postpone if possible. You could also NOW drive to your sister to lend her a shoulder. Just do anything but a unpersonal video call. \n\nAt least my 2 cents. You had the chance to improve the relationship with your sister and chose do destroy it instead.", "YTA", "YTA 10000% and you raised your daughter to be one too. How horrible to have a sister like you. I can\u2019t imagine my sister doing that to me. Go on your trip because she deserves better than you. Yours and your daughter\u2019s self righteous presence would only add to the trauma of losing a loved one.", "Yta", "OMG, YTA. this tragedy should put priorities into crystal clear clarity. You and your daughters actually have the luxury of being able to postpone a trip and experience it still, you just don\u2019t want to. Your daughter will move on and find someone else that\u2019s not a cheating bastard (I hope) bc she will have the chance to do so. If you were my sister and you did this, you would be dead to me. I would never talk to you, never forgive you and I would make it clear to everyone that you are a self centered person who cannot be counted on and you are clearly raising your children to be the same way. Funerals are not actually for the person who died, they are to help those that lost grieve and feel support around them.", "YTA. Nothing can justify this. If the roles were reversed and your sister called to tell you \u201cI\u2019m sorry your kid is dead, I\u2019m going on a trip that weekend so I won\u2019t be there\u201d you\u2019d probably do worse than what she did.

You can reschedule a trip, your nephew only has one funeral.", "I think it all depends on how close you are. If you're truly not that close, I would say it makes sense to choose your daughters well being over the funeral of a person you barely knew.", "Have Annie and your other daughters go on the trip and you meet up with them later.", "YTA.  Expect a lot of your family deciding to go no contact with you.  I would.", "Wow YTA. \nI really hope your daughter grows out of being a selfish Brat who's mother fights all of her battles. \nCheating isn't okay but he dodged a bullet.", "I get you're torn. If the situation were reversed, how would you feel if Catherine said she couldn't make it to your daughter's funeral due to a girls' trip? How do you think the rest of the family would view Catherine after that? You're also setting a pretty bad example for your daughters. I do believe YTA.

The extraneous details are clearly an attempt to distract and justify.", "YTA its not just about how close you are to someone, its supporting the family through the difficult time and letting them know you care. Im sure the trip could have been rearranged and your daughter wouldve understood. Shoe on the other foot, how would you feel in said situation..", "YTA and so is your daughter. \nIt\u2019s a funeral they can\u2019t be changed. Also you expect would have expected her to drop everything and come to your kids if the same thing happened. Just wow!", "Softly YTA - how I grew up family funerals trump everything else.  In this case your daughter will be OK to wait a week or more for her trip.\n\nEdit to add - I would go solo and not bring your family.", "Wow, you start off by trying to use the whole divorced parents bit to gather sympathy. You're 46 and parents divorced a long time ago. You're daughter was hurting but your sister was devastated and yeah losing a child is not the same as being cheated on. \n\nIt would be one thing maybe if you just flat out couldn't, you allude to being able to you're just not so hurting, maybe no so much.", "I get your reasoning but barring financial pressures related to re-booking the trip and attending the funeral i would say YTA.

Grief is hard and I do feel for Catherine but I honestly can\u2019t understand why it\u2019s such a huge deal to not go because you have something big planned.

I know it doesn't sound great but please read and understand the whole thing.\n\nMy (46f) parents divorced when I was young and they both remarried. I also have two half sisters from dad's first marriage. Bottom line, I have a lot of siblings. While I do try and keep in touch, I'm not close to all of them.\n\nThis post is mainly about my half sister who I'll call Catherine (63f). As I mentioned me and Catherine talk, but we're not extremely close and never was growing up. She also lives in a different country now so don't get to see each other much.\n\nMy daughter Annie (23f) was engaged to her boyfriend of 6 years and the wedding meant to happen this summer, but she found out he was cheating with one of her close friends. Obviously she isn't doing so well and I hate to see her like this, so I suggested we take a girls trip to LA (where she was supposed to go on honeymoon). This trip is just me and my three daughters. This cheered Annie up a bit and she's really been looking forward to it. We've already booked everything.\n\nThere's been a family tragedy with Catherine's son and his partner. This is awful news and we're all hurting. The funeral is the week of our trip, and it's also not like I can just delay the trip a day because I'll be flying there and flying back. I also know Annie's really been looking forward to this and I don't want her to be even more upset.\n\nI did talk to Catherine and told her I'm really sorry, but I can't make it to the funeral, but I'll video call in. Catherine got very upset with me and hung up.\n\nSome of my other siblings are saying I should be going to the funeral and I'm not being supportive.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "EDIT: Iread the comment saying the trip can be pushed back but they dont want too, nevermind definitly YTA\n\n\nNTA but please ask your daughters not to post pictures of the trip for a little while, as that would be insensitive to your sister and extended family.

Like, getting your heart ripped out and just living with a hole inside you. And finding out not everyone hurts as much and they can't put the grief for your child above everything else hurts too.\n\nThat said, the nephew can't be helped any more but the daughter can. The living have to come first. Especially since it sounds like the grieving mother has a lot more support than OP's daughter.\n\nThe best thing that can be done is sending something like flowers, a card, sending food (like an Uber eats type deal), and the most important part will come later.

Or you move in after education and realise you actually don\u2019t like this person.\n\nIt sucks that she got cheated on. A trip is a great idea. Postponing it for a week to attend the funeral might actually help ops daughter realise just how small of an issue she has. \n\nMaybe attending the funeral.

Your daughter is able to move on and find a new partner to one day marry and go on a honeymoon.\nYou know your sister would have dropped everything to be there for you but that\u2019s just her and you shouldn\u2019t be held to the same standard. Do you even comprehend how terrible you are! No compassion, sympathy or empathy. \nSorry I won\u2019t (because you absolutely can attend the funeral) attend your child\u2019s funeral because my daughter had her heart broken and I won\u2019t change the plans to be there for you and the rest of the family as you grieve so we will go to LA and party as you bury your child.

And yes this isn't really about me, it's about Annie, and she doesn't want to postpone\n\nYTA. Ending a relationship and being cheated on is horribly painful, I get it. And I think it\u2019s great you want to do something to cheer your daughter up, but two people died. I think supporting your sister during this unfortunate and very difficult time is higher priority than taking a girls trip to LA. Postponing it is the best thing to do here.\n\nETA: also this comment\n\n> We technically can push it back a couple of weeks, but Annie doesn't want to do that. She's already been through a lot and I don't want to have to tell her we have to postpone the trip\n\nWtf is wrong with you, OP?

We had a family member recently suddenly pass and some of my other family members were unable to attend due to pre planned international trips, my two brothers didn\u2019t even come in at this time either for the funeral due to cost of travel and some work obligations. We all plan on getting together for a celebration of life around our loved ones birthday.", "YTA. I can\u2019t believe you suggested CALLING IN from your girls trip to a funeral. Absolutely tasteless", "Everyone saying N T A is delusional. This is a family tragedy. I saw a comment saying \"the nephew can't be helped anymore and the daughter can\" and this legit made me want to vomit. Going to the funeral isn't supporting your nephew, it's supporting your SISTER. \n\nSeriously, if OPs daughter doesn't have the character to rally around her blood family who by all accounts are good to her, she's a crappy person.

I get that someone passing away is more intense than someone cheating but I\u2019m gonna be blunt here, the nephew is gone. There are so many people that don\u2019t go to the funeral of their loved ones and grieve in a different way and you aren\u2019t obligated to go. My parents always gave me the option to go or not when we had a funeral coming up. Your daughter is still alive and is hurting.

OPs sister DOES want her to come, from the comments OP has made they actually are close-or at least older sister who has done everything she could for OP her entire life did- and cost is a non issue by OPs own proclamation.

Given that you CAN, that you are close enough to be invited to each other\u2019s kids\u2019 weddings, and that she would be supporting you in an equivalent reserved situation, you would be an asshole to skip it.

That is a genius idea because those days (birthdays, holidays, etc.) without the loved one will be so hard. You can also be some real comfort by continuing to connect with her in the months to come. I\u2019ve often heard that\u2019s when it\u2019s most lonely. People swamp you at the funeral but then you\u2019re left alone and people forget. So maybe every month or so, make an effort to call and talk. That may mean more to her in the long run than just being another face in the crowd now.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m changing my mind after I saw comments about OP comment that she could push back trip by a week but daughter doesn\u2019t want to. Sorry but that\u2019s ridiculous. In original post, implication was it was one or the other, like she would lose all pre-paid travel expenses if she went to funeral.

It is sad for the OP's daughter to have her world completely changed. I've been cheated on but thankfully, I also didn't get betrayed by friend in the process. That is terrible.

If you miss a funeral to support a grown woman for a six-month old breakup with a fun trip, and later you try to offer support to the deceased's family on their birthday, you won't be \"a real comfort\" to them, you are going to get thrown put on your ear, very deservedly.", "Just to point out that the \u201cchild\u201d in question was a grown adult with a partner, not an actual child.

I was going solely off OP's comments in the post, and I should know better.  I \"assumed\" that since the daughter was engaged, it was probably a long-term relationship, so pretty serious, and I viewed the trip as more of a comfort trip for OP's daughters, not just a girls trip.  But you're right, at this point, it def sounds like if she doesn't cancel the trip, irreparable damage will be done to her larger family and she needs to tell her daughter the trip will be delayed.", "This exactly.

Also, sounds like she was close to her nephew. She said that. So if it is important to her sister, then maybe this is about being there for a family member who is going through a really hard time. Who would do the same for you. And you can\u2019t compare the loss of a child to your daughter going through a difficult time due to a failed wedding. It\u2019s also not like this is an either or.

This is not an either or situation. She can support her daughter and still go to funeral. It\u2019s just a decent thing to do. But sounds like the OP is more about taking than giving.

Didn't stop my aunty though, she decided she was now the matriach of the family even though nobody else see her like this. Me and my cousin both had small weddings and aunty (along with other aunties and uncles!) didn't make the guest list, she told any who would listen how we broke her heart even though we hadn't actually seen her in years!\n\nI tell you this because I see OPs family mirrored in my own. Just because 1 person sees a relationship as being one was, doesn't mean the other person is obliged to make it a reality if that's not how they feel.
