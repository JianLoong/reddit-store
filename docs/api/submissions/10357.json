I know it doesn't sound great but please read and understand the whole thing.\n\nMy (46f) parents divorced when I was young and they both remarried. I also have two half sisters from dad's first marriage. Bottom line, I have a lot of siblings. While I do try and keep in touch, I'm not close to all of them.\n\nThis post is mainly about my half sister who I'll call Catherine (63f). As I mentioned me and Catherine talk, but we're not extremely close and never was growing up. She also lives in a different country now so don't get to see each other much.\n\nMy daughter Annie (23f) was engaged to her boyfriend of 6 years and the wedding meant to happen this summer, but she found out he was cheating with one of her close friends. Obviously she isn't doing so well and I hate to see her like this, so I suggested we take a girls trip to LA (where she was supposed to go on honeymoon). This trip is just me and my three daughters. This cheered Annie up a bit and she's really been looking forward to it. We've already booked everything.\n\nThere's been a family tragedy with Catherine's son and his partner. This is awful news and we're all hurting. The funeral is the week of our trip, and it's also not like I can just delay the trip a day because I'll be flying there and flying back. I also know Annie's really been looking forward to this and I don't want her to be even more upset.\n\nI did talk to Catherine and told her I'm really sorry, but I can't make it to the funeral, but I'll video call in. Catherine got very upset with me and hung up.\n\nSome of my other siblings are saying I should be going to the funeral and I'm not being supportive.", "created_utc": 1676810661, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1169fgy/aita_for_missing_my_nephews_funeral_to_go_on_a/", "score": 1800, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're the asshole. Your sister lost a child and you won't go to the funeral? You said in a comment that you could push the vacation back but chose not to.\n\nHow mad would you be if Catherine didn't go to Annie's funeral?", "YTA OP\n\nSeriously I personally can't believe you would even think about this for a second?\n\nYour nephew is gone. He won't ever come back while you can postpone this trip.\n\nGo postpone this trip and get yourself to your sister and support her. You daughter won't die if the trip is postponed\n\nFor everyone saying N T A let me make a few things clear, Here are OP's comments:\n\n>**I know she would come to one of my children's funerals (God forbid), but I don't think that's a fair comparison. She's much older than me and always had the protective sister thing going on, where she would do things for her siblings whether she wanted to or not.**  \n>  \n>**And yes this isn't really about me, it's about Annie, and she doesn't want to postpone**\n\nHold on you expect her to come to your kid's funeral but you can't go to hers? I said it once I said it again Annie wont die just because her trip was delayed. Seriously there are more people who have gone though something like her and they are doing fine.\n\n>**I did know my nephew of course well enough, and we were all invited to his wedding next year. But my daughters weren't that close to him because he was significantly older than them**\n\nWhy does your daughters not being close to them even important? He's still your nephew. \n\n>**We technically can push it back a couple of weeks, but Annie doesn't want to do that. She's already been through a lot and I don't want to have to tell her we have to postpone the trip**\n\nI said it twice, I'll say it again Annie wont die if her trip is postponed.\n\nI hope your sister goes NC with you. The only reason I haven't said I hope something similar happens to you is because I know the pain and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.", "\"also not like I can just delay the trip a day \"\n\nExcuses, excuses.\n\nYTA OP.", "NTA. This may sound harsh but you're not oblige to attend and your daughter needs your support, as a mother you prioritized her and I don't see anything wrong. Your siblings must understand you for choosing your daughters over your nephew's funeral.", "Question: the funeral is on the trip to LA week and you cannot come, fine. Will it be possible for you go to visit your sis family before the funeral then and see your nephew for the last time? How hard is it for you to go from your location to your sis location and then to LA? Just would like to understand more.", "You understand that your relationship with you sister is over forever, right?  There will be no coming back from this.  Y\u2019all are done.", "YTA\n\nNo sorry, this is pathetic. I get Annie's hurting, having a partner cheat on you is definitely awful. But all these other comments acting like they *need* to go on a trip to LA right this moment and can't postpone it by a week? Her daughter's health will deteriorate that much if they slightly push a trip back? OP commented they could push it back, but don't want to:\n\n*We technically can push it back a couple of weeks, but Annie doesn't want to do that. She's already been through a lot and I don't want to have to tell her we have to postpone the trip*\n\nCatherine hasn't been through a lot OP? Losing her own damn son and her future daughter in law? This comment from OP:\n\n*I know she would come to one of my children's funerals (God forbid), but I don't think that's a fair comparison. She's much older than me and always had the protective sister thing going on, where she would do things for her siblings whether she wanted to or not.*\n\nRight, so Catherine would drop everything to come to one of your children's funerals but you don't think it's a fair comparison because \"she's much older than me\". Then this:\n\n*I did know my nephew of course well enough, and we were all invited to his wedding next year. But my daughters weren't that close to him because he was significantly older than them*\n\nIt honestly sounds like to me OP would go, but her daughter doesn't want to postpone by a week. If that's the case OP, please teach your daughter some empathy. She's 23. \n\nI'm not trying to downplay how difficult it is to break up with your fiance, but for fuck's sake, try to understand. \n\nYour nephew isn't having a wedding either because he and his partner are both fucking dead.", "YTA. You are not \u201cobligated\u201d to go to the funeral, however, what a lot of redditors don\u2019t understand is when you\u2019re part of a family you sometimes do things you might not want to in order to support them when tragedies happen. It sucks your daughter got cheated on, but your nephew and his partner DIED. Whether or not you\u2019re close to your half sister, you should support her in what is likely the hardest time in her life, losing her child. If you have zero feelings or empathy then go ahead and take your daughter on vacation, but expect consequences for your actions.", "YTA. If your daughter died and and a family member ditched the funeral to go on a trip how would you feel?", "YTA. \n\nIt's great, and sweet that you want to support your daughter through this shocking and painful time; that you want to do something to cheer her up. But, a trip can be postponed and rescheduled. And I get that you're not super close with your sister.\n\nBut someone died.\n\nA funeral only happens once. They can't reschedule the funeral around you. By her reaction, it sounds like your sister is in need of your love and support right now too. And that she was really hoping that you'd be there for the services, and for her during this soul-crushing grief-filled time. And that's where my vote comes in.", "YTA.  There are a lot of different factors in funerals.  There is a difference of a grandparent dies, or a grandchild.  Dipping out on the funeral of an elderly person whose died naturally after a long life is one thing.  But this is someone younger than you; the funeral would take precedence.\n\nIt's not a clear-cut case one way or the other, and I'm sure people will forgive you if you go on the trip anyway.  It's not the worst asshole thing ever, but it still counts as y t a.", "I have a feeling you know YTA! I hope you are ready to have the majority of your family treat you like crap for the next handful of years because that's what you just walked into. You've done nothing but make excuses in your comments which shows that you obviously did not care at all about your nephew. Your sister lost a child and needs the support of her family whereas your daughter's fiance stepped out on her with another person. There is no comparison there. Your daughter will get over that in time whereas your sister will never get over the loss of her child. You're a selfish asshole and so is your daughter. I hope you weren't planning on spending any holidays this year with your family cuz I have a feeling you're not going to be invited. \n\nYTA", "You can\u2019t rebook for your nephew\u2019s **funeral**? And was his partner also killed?\n\nYes, YTA.", "YTA because you admit that 1) you could push back the trip to LA but don't want to do it because your daughter doesn't want to, 2) your relationship with your sister is close enough that she would attend a funeral if the roles were reversed, 3) money does not seem to be a limiting factor in your ability to travel to the funeral. \n\nYour decision to not attend seems to boil down to the fact that it would inconvenient because your daughter doesn't want to change the date of your girls trip.\n\nMaybe it would help your daughter if she were to attend the funeral with you, put her breakup into perspective and reconnect with extended family.", "YTA. \n\nSometimes people are in a situation where it is absolutely impossible to be at two important family events simultaneously. This, is not that. What is the irreparable harm by delaying the trip a week to attend the funeral? Yes, Annie is justifiably sad and upset, but really what's the harm in rescheduling by a few days?\n\nThe harm of not going to your nephew's funeral is the death of your relationship with your sister on top of that loss. She just lost her son and his partner. She's devastated. Don't look for understanding there, she has her own grief to manage and killing your relationship with her at this moment by not going is another burden you're putting on her. Unkind, and you're justifying it because you are blessed with an overabundance of family and don't have a particularly close relationship with her. Other people in your family are going to be disgusted with you over this too, so anticipate a ripple effect beyond the relationship you're willing to sacrifice.\n\nThis doesn't have to be an either/or situation. Moving the trip might be a pain in the butt, however it's possible; you're not cancelling the trip and surely if Annie is reasonable she will understand a short delay for a death in the family - unforeseen circumstances causing a change in plans. You can actually split the baby here. Why aren't you?", "Did you get travel insurance? If so, rescheduling your trip should be quick and easy with a copy of the death certificate. Often just a picture of it will do. Even if you *didn't* get the insurance, most airlines will provide refunds or not charge change fees for a death in the family. The process is just more onerous.\n\nYTA because there was a relatively easy solution to this problem.", "YTA\n\nYour clearly not hurting that much by it or it would be a priority to attend. You\u2019ve said you could push the trip back so there is literally no excuse. \n\nPut your self in your sisters shoes, how would you feel if the roles were reversed?", "YTA. This really just seems as though you would rather enjoy a girls' trip, and has very little to do with Annie at all.\n\nThe woman lost her child. Annie broke off a relationship that obviously wasn't going to be a healthy one had it continued on. The situations are hardly comparable. Especially given the fact that Catherine moved away to a different country. I assume that also means she doesn't have an extended family network she can lean on close by.\n\nYou said the trip is for the four of you. The easiest solution seems to be just having your three daughters enjoy the trip, while you go to the funeral. \n\nYour daughter is old enough to know why a funeral is more important than a cheer-me-up trip, so I don't really see how she could make a fuss over it?", "I get that your daughter is devastated about her wedding being off because she was cheated on. I get that the trip was already paid for. That stinks. However, consider your sister\u2019s feelings. How devastated is she that her son is dead? Your daughter will date again and probably get married someday. Your sister won\u2019t get her son back. She needs you, and I\u2019m sorry to say it\u2019s more than your daughter does after a breakup. YTA. You can plan another trip to LA, and this would teach your daughter something. What it\u2019s teaching her now is that funerals don\u2019t matter, weddings are more important, and it\u2019s okay that your grieving sister might not talk to you anymore after this.", "I was on nah till you said you know him well and was going to attend his wedding next year. You can postpone the trip, annie will get over it.", "YTA: She's being spoiled, she doesn't want to postpone a girls trip for a FUNERAL? Someone is died and it's a heartless not to go.", "I'm not close to my siblings my siblings either.  They all communicate with each other more often than I do.  With that said, if they had a child pass away, I would go to the funeral, at the very least, out of responsibility.  Hard to say that you are the AH because I don't think anybody can judge another's relationship with their family, but I will have to go with a very soft YTA.  Also, if your daughter doesn't support postponing the trip for her cousin's funeral, I would question that as well.", "Yta bc you say the trip *can* be postponed.  It's not trip OR funeral. \n\nI mean, you can def not postpone the trip, but you need to understand you will 100% be damaging your relationships with the vast majority of your family.", "YTA\n\nNormally yes, the feelings of your daughters are more important. But you are an AH for having a great time with your daughters and your sister is grieving in pain and asks you to be at her side. How would you feel, when it would be the funeral of one of your kids and your family would be like \"Sorry, but we want to have some nice family trip instead\"\n\nYou do not attend the funeral for your nephew, you attend for the support of the living family members.\n\nI wonder if you checked all options: How long is the flight between your trip location and the funeral? Your daughters could fly without you, you could join later or maybe travel back and forth or postpone if possible. You could also NOW drive to your sister to lend her a shoulder. Just do anything but a unpersonal video call. \n\nAt least my 2 cents. You had the chance to improve the relationship with your sister and chose do destroy it instead.", "YTA", "YTA 10000% and you raised your daughter to be one too. How horrible to have a sister like you. I can\u2019t imagine my sister doing that to me. Go on your trip because she deserves better than you. Yours and your daughter\u2019s self righteous presence would only add to the trauma of losing a loved one.", "Yta", "OMG, YTA. this tragedy should put priorities into crystal clear clarity. You and your daughters actually have the luxury of being able to postpone a trip and experience it still, you just don\u2019t want to. Your daughter will move on and find someone else that\u2019s not a cheating bastard (I hope) bc she will have the chance to do so. If you were my sister and you did this, you would be dead to me. I would never talk to you, never forgive you and I would make it clear to everyone that you are a self centered person who cannot be counted on and you are clearly raising your children to be the same way. Funerals are not actually for the person who died, they are to help those that lost grieve and feel support around them.", "YTA. Nothing can justify this. If the roles were reversed and your sister called to tell you \u201cI\u2019m sorry your kid is dead, I\u2019m going on a trip that weekend so I won\u2019t be there\u201d you\u2019d probably do worse than what she did.

You can reschedule a trip, your nephew only has one funeral.", "I think it all depends on how close you are. If you're truly not that close, I would say it makes sense to choose your daughters well being over the funeral of a person you barely knew.", "Have Annie and your other daughters go on the trip and you meet up with them later.", "YTA.  Expect a lot of your family deciding to go no contact with you.  I would.", "Wow YTA. \nI really hope your daughter grows out of being a selfish Brat who's mother fights all of her battles. \nCheating isn't okay but he dodged a bullet.", "I get you're torn. If the situation were reversed, how would you feel if Catherine said she couldn't make it to your daughter's funeral due to a girls' trip? How do you think the rest of the family would view Catherine after that? You're also setting a pretty bad example for your daughters. I do believe YTA.

The extraneous details are clearly an attempt to distract and justify.", "YTA its not just about how close you are to someone, its supporting the family through the difficult time and letting them know you care. Im sure the trip could have been rearranged and your daughter wouldve understood. Shoe on the other foot, how would you feel in said situation..", "YTA and so is your daughter. \nIt\u2019s a funeral they can\u2019t be changed. Also you expect would have expected her to drop everything and come to your kids if the same thing happened. Just wow!", "Softly YTA - how I grew up family funerals trump everything else.  In this case your daughter will be OK to wait a week or more for her trip.\n\nEdit to add - I would go solo and not bring your family.", "Wow, you start off by trying to use the whole divorced parents bit to gather sympathy. You're 46 and parents divorced a long time ago. You're daughter was hurting but your sister was devastated and yeah losing a child is not the same as being cheated on. \n\nIt would be one thing maybe if you just flat out couldn't, you allude to being able to you're just not so hurting, maybe no so much.", "I get your reasoning but barring financial pressures related to re-booking the trip and attending the funeral i would say YTA.

Grief is hard and I do feel for Catherine but I honestly can\u2019t understand why it\u2019s such a huge deal to not go because you have something big planned.

I know it doesn't sound great but please read and understand the whole thing.\n\nMy (46f) parents divorced when I was young and they both remarried. I also have two half sisters from dad's first marriage. Bottom line, I have a lot of siblings. While I do try and keep in touch, I'm not close to all of them.\n\nThis post is mainly about my half sister who I'll call Catherine (63f). As I mentioned me and Catherine talk, but we're not extremely close and never was growing up. She also lives in a different country now so don't get to see each other much.\n\nMy daughter Annie (23f) was engaged to her boyfriend of 6 years and the wedding meant to happen this summer, but she found out he was cheating with one of her close friends. Obviously she isn't doing so well and I hate to see her like this, so I suggested we take a girls trip to LA (where she was supposed to go on honeymoon). This trip is just me and my three daughters. This cheered Annie up a bit and she's really been looking forward to it. We've already booked everything.\n\nThere's been a family tragedy with Catherine's son and his partner. This is awful news and we're all hurting. The funeral is the week of our trip, and it's also not like I can just delay the trip a day because I'll be flying there and flying back. I also know Annie's really been looking forward to this and I don't want her to be even more upset.\n\nI did talk to Catherine and told her I'm really sorry, but I can't make it to the funeral, but I'll video call in. Catherine got very upset with me and hung up.\n\nSome of my other siblings are saying I should be going to the funeral and I'm not being supportive.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "EDIT: Iread the comment saying the trip can be pushed back but they dont want too, nevermind definitly YTA\n\n\nNTA but please ask your daughters not to post pictures of the trip for a little while, as that would be insensitive to your sister and extended family.

Like, getting your heart ripped out and just living with a hole inside you. And finding out not everyone hurts as much and they can't put the grief for your child above everything else hurts too.\n\nThat said, the nephew can't be helped any more but the daughter can. The living have to come first. Especially since it sounds like the grieving mother has a lot more support than OP's daughter.\n\nThe best thing that can be done is sending something like flowers, a card, sending food (like an Uber eats type deal), and the most important part will come later.

Or you move in after education and realise you actually don\u2019t like this person.\n\nIt sucks that she got cheated on. A trip is a great idea. Postponing it for a week to attend the funeral might actually help ops daughter realise just how small of an issue she has. \n\nMaybe attending the funeral.

Your daughter is able to move on and find a new partner to one day marry and go on a honeymoon.\nYou know your sister would have dropped everything to be there for you but that\u2019s just her and you shouldn\u2019t be held to the same standard. Do you even comprehend how terrible you are! No compassion, sympathy or empathy. \nSorry I won\u2019t (because you absolutely can attend the funeral) attend your child\u2019s funeral because my daughter had her heart broken and I won\u2019t change the plans to be there for you and the rest of the family as you grieve so we will go to LA and party as you bury your child.

And yes this isn't really about me, it's about Annie, and she doesn't want to postpone\n\nYTA. Ending a relationship and being cheated on is horribly painful, I get it. And I think it\u2019s great you want to do something to cheer your daughter up, but two people died. I think supporting your sister during this unfortunate and very difficult time is higher priority than taking a girls trip to LA. Postponing it is the best thing to do here.\n\nETA: also this comment\n\n> We technically can push it back a couple of weeks, but Annie doesn't want to do that. She's already been through a lot and I don't want to have to tell her we have to postpone the trip\n\nWtf is wrong with you, OP?

We had a family member recently suddenly pass and some of my other family members were unable to attend due to pre planned international trips, my two brothers didn\u2019t even come in at this time either for the funeral due to cost of travel and some work obligations. We all plan on getting together for a celebration of life around our loved ones birthday.", "YTA. I can\u2019t believe you suggested CALLING IN from your girls trip to a funeral. Absolutely tasteless", "Everyone saying N T A is delusional. This is a family tragedy. I saw a comment saying \"the nephew can't be helped anymore and the daughter can\" and this legit made me want to vomit. Going to the funeral isn't supporting your nephew, it's supporting your SISTER. \n\nSeriously, if OPs daughter doesn't have the character to rally around her blood family who by all accounts are good to her, she's a crappy person.

I get that someone passing away is more intense than someone cheating but I\u2019m gonna be blunt here, the nephew is gone. There are so many people that don\u2019t go to the funeral of their loved ones and grieve in a different way and you aren\u2019t obligated to go. My parents always gave me the option to go or not when we had a funeral coming up. Your daughter is still alive and is hurting.

We decided to ask the funeral home to record the service so that family could watch it if they wished to. There was no drama, no berating and saying they were not being supportive.

I agree that you\u2019re prioritizing your daughter and need to put her needs first. However, I think the most important thing is to be there for your sister AFTER the funeral. The hardest part about death for me, is that everyone grieves and gives support the day of the funeral and maybe a few days after, but then that dies off. When that happens, people feel so alone and like they are the only one going through that process and that everyone has moved on. I think it\u2019s important to be there for her through that stage, as I\u2019d imagine she\u2019ll have plenty of support the day of and a few days after. I think she will eventually understand. She\u2019s grieving hard right now, and emotionally fragile. I know for me, when I\u2019m like that, the slightest thing can be perceived as a stab in the back.

Yes she'll probably go on and find someone else, but it's likely she can't see that, and there's absolutely no time limit on how long it takes to get over a break up, some people never get over it and never find someone else because they've lost the ability to trust. \n\nOP is between a rock and a hard place. I see both sides of it. But I know in my family that it would never be the case that the entire family would cut ties with someone for not attending a funeral, we'd never even ask someone to choose. But like I say, may be my family is weird.", "I'm not willing to judge Annie. Shes grieving, she's just lost the future she was planning. 70+ years of a life with a husband, the kids she thought they'd have together. Of course a break up isn't the same as someone dying, but so many people are willing to make grief a competition. Nobody knows how they'll deal with a situation until they're thrown into the middle of it. A friend of mine tried to take his own life after his long-term girlfriend split up with him (she wasn't cheating, she just didn't love him any more), so all the comments about how Annie is the AH breaks my heart, nobody knows where her head is right now, but so many people here are making the situations into a competition and declaring OPs sister the winner. I'll see the positive in it though, clearly you've all never had a life crisis, never been thrown into a situation where the dark cloud comes down and you just can't remember what it's like to be happy and can't imagine ever being happy again.", "> As I mentioned me and Catherine talk, but we're not extremely close and never was growing up. She also lives in a different country now so don't get to see each other much.\n\nplease explain your opinion.", ">the worst part after someone dies is about 6 months later.\n\nThis is why I send a little note six months after a loss to tell the bereaved I still think about the person who died. People feel so awkward and anxious about bringing up the loss later on that they usually say nothing, so it must seem like everyone's forgotten about the loved one, and that's a terrible feeling. (Of course, I send a card and note right after getting the news, too.)\n\nOh, and YTA to the OP.", "I need more info. You said your sister lives out of the country. Where? How far away? It\u2019s not feasible or logical to expect someone to go on an extended trip to a funeral for someone you barely knew, family or not. Within Europe, maybe but  I certainly wouldn\u2019t travel to a funeral if I needed a passport to do it.", "Your edit doesn't sway my vote here. NTA. Yeah they can move the trip, yeah the daughter doesn't WANT to but here is the thing OP is the mother who has a daughter who is alive and suffering in her own way. Daughter is going through some shit of her own and doesn't want to be surrounded by death and grieving people who will make her feel worse. Why does that make her such a bad guy in everyone's eyes? Because death?\n\nAs horrible as it is, the nephew is dead. The sister will be grieving the rest of her life because of it. OP's daughter needs her now. OP can come back when the support system that sister has now is no longer there. As some commenters, who have lost their own children already stated, when the initial shock dissipates, everyone goes back to their lives and that's when it gets hard again. That is when OP can be there. \n\nOh but fuck OP and her other daughters for being there for her own daughter/sister her time of need. \n\nDown vote to hell I don't give a damn. Death sucks all around but doesn't take precedent above the living.", "Sis will never forgive her.  She's going through the most horrific loss imaginable, and will never completely recover.  \n\nOP says she isn't really close with Sis, so I guess it all comes down to whether or not she can live with estrangement as opposed to her daughter being a little put out due to having to reschedule.  I'm assuming cousin meant little or nothing to daughter, or the death would be foremost in her mind and knock the admittedly terrible breakup off the front page.  This is an actual death!  It also might wreck OP's relationships with other relatives who she might in fact be close to.  It might already have done irreparable damage that the family knows her first instinct was not to show.", "Right. The living people being Catherine. She should be first.", "It\u2019s because of this \u2018you don\u2019t owe anyone anything\u2019 \u2018you arent obligated\u2019 attitude. I can\u2019t stand it", "You're right it's not a competition. Annie is grieving, and deserves to grieve her loss her own way. I don't judge her for this, I don't judge her for needing anything to work through her pain. I am judging her for being inconsiderate towards other people grieving however. She needs to get out, go on that trip, and that's fine, but when that trip can easily be pushed back a week or two, I find it incredibly selfish of her to say 'no I don't want that'. She is not the only one grieving, so is her aunt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>clearly you've all never had a life crisis\n\nThis however, is where you lost any credibillity and decency. Holy fuck what an incredibly invalidating thing to say to people. Because we consider all parties involved and not just Annie we must not have hardships in life? Check my account, check the subs I post and comment in besides this one and dare tell me that again.", "The thing here is that while her daughter is also grieving, and is alive, so is her sister. Her sister\u2019s grief is just as valid as her daughter\u2019s, and the loss is pretty fucking brutal. Heartbreak is terrible. I\u2019m not gonna say it isn\u2019t. But losing a child is like losing a vital limb. She has an obligation to both parties, and she has an opportunity here to support BOTH of them\u2014it\u2019s not a black-and-white  choice here. She can literally be a good mom and a good sister. She just doesn\u2019t want to.", "Honestly this. Could you judge OP for saying that her sister had the big sister thing going and that she\u2019d do it regardless of if she wanted to but since she\u2019s the younger sister she doesn\u2019t have the same expectation basically? Sure, but the fact remains that her daughter is going through her own shit and she deserves support too. It\u2019s no where near the same level of grief, but being cheated on is devastating too, and she can\u2019t be there for her family if she\u2019s being consumed by that still.", "Apparently you\u2019re not that sorry or you\u2019d move the trip or join your daughters later. You suck.", "Exactly this. People get so caught up in their poor choices that they think there's no way to make amends and then just leave it as is.\n\nPart of acknowledging poor choices is apologizing to those who were hurt as a result. This is the perfect opportunity to strengthen family ties and learn from mistakes.\n\nTime to put on your big girl pants, OP.", "Yep. If this was me? Don\u2019t bother showing up for the funeral, his birthday, or ever again. I\u2019ll be spending that time with people who want to support me while I try to get through the worst thing a parent can go through. Enjoy your trip, sis!", "I get that but it also seems like she is in a hard position. Her kid needs her and so does her sister. She is going to let someone down.", "I was all about to go N-T-A but these comments, ESPECIALLY the one where OP can change the date of the trip makes it suuuuch an ah move. YTA, change the date of the \u201cgirls trip\u201d to attend you nephews funeral.", "After seeing this. YTA\n\nIf it\u2019s something you can do then certainly support your family. Your daughter can wait a week if needed.", "Why doesn't the daughter want to?", "...now we why the wedding is off.... Annie seemed to be such a nice girl  /", "Yep, the apples didn\u2019t fall far from the tree.", ">Doing god\u2019s work\n\nNo you're not... you're looking for confirmation bias that you being a jerk (troll) on reddit is acceptable. None of these things matter - not wanting to go to a funeral needs no excuse, you just don't go. I don't care if the trip is movable, they were invited to a wedding, or if the older step would \"do it for her\" - not being there isn't going to make him any less dead, or her step any less sad. She would be the AH if she was mean about it, but declining to be present isn't being mean, it's just not being there in person. If the family ties are that fragile... probably best to find out now.", "Its amazing how often comments sell out the OP. So many times I'm like NtA then the comments make me change my answer.", "Why should the daughter change the trip? The whole point is to help her get out of her sad place.  She probably had almost no connection to the aunt or her now-deceased cousin.", "I mean personally, I find a FUNERAL takes precedence over a broken engagement. She\u2019ll get over the loss of her bf/fianc\u00e9e a lot easier than the mother losing her child.", "This is not a close relative. And for the daughter, it\u2019s a really traumatic thing to end a six year relationship and engagement, especially due to the betrayal of infidelity. \n\nThe sister still has plenty of other people to support her. The OP\u2018s attendance at the funeral is not going to help the sister get over it any sooner."]}
