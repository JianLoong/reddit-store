I know it doesn't sound great but please read and understand the whole thing.\n\nMy (46f) parents divorced when I was young and they both remarried. I also have two half sisters from dad's first marriage. Bottom line, I have a lot of siblings. While I do try and keep in touch, I'm not close to all of them.\n\nThis post is mainly about my half sister who I'll call Catherine (63f). As I mentioned me and Catherine talk, but we're not extremely close and never was growing up. She also lives in a different country now so don't get to see each other much.\n\nMy daughter Annie (23f) was engaged to her boyfriend of 6 years and the wedding meant to happen this summer, but she found out he was cheating with one of her close friends. Obviously she isn't doing so well and I hate to see her like this, so I suggested we take a girls trip to LA (where she was supposed to go on honeymoon). This trip is just me and my three daughters. This cheered Annie up a bit and she's really been looking forward to it. We've already booked everything.\n\nThere's been a family tragedy with Catherine's son and his partner. This is awful news and we're all hurting. The funeral is the week of our trip, and it's also not like I can just delay the trip a day because I'll be flying there and flying back. I also know Annie's really been looking forward to this and I don't want her to be even more upset.\n\nI did talk to Catherine and told her I'm really sorry, but I can't make it to the funeral, but I'll video call in. Catherine got very upset with me and hung up.\n\nSome of my other siblings are saying I should be going to the funeral and I'm not being supportive.", "created_utc": 1676810661, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1169fgy/aita_for_missing_my_nephews_funeral_to_go_on_a/", "score": 203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're the asshole. Your sister lost a child and you won't go to the funeral? You said in a comment that you could push the vacation back but chose not to.\n\nHow mad would you be if Catherine didn't go to Annie's funeral?", "YTA OP\n\nSeriously I personally can't believe you would even think about this for a second?\n\nYour nephew is gone. He won't ever come back while you can postpone this trip.\n\nGo postpone this trip and get yourself to your sister and support her. You daughter won't die if the trip is postponed\n\nFor everyone saying N T A let me make a few things clear, Here are OP's comments:\n\n>**I know she would come to one of my children's funerals (God forbid), but I don't think that's a fair comparison. She's much older than me and always had the protective sister thing going on, where she would do things for her siblings whether she wanted to or not.**  \n>  \n>**And yes this isn't really about me, it's about Annie, and she doesn't want to postpone**\n\nHold on you expect her to come to your kid's funeral but you can't go to hers? I said it once I said it again Annie wont die just because her trip was delayed. Seriously there are more people who have gone though something like her and they are doing fine.\n\n>**I did know my nephew of course well enough, and we were all invited to his wedding next year. But my daughters weren't that close to him because he was significantly older than them**\n\nWhy does your daughters not being close to them even important? He's still your nephew. \n\n>**We technically can push it back a couple of weeks, but Annie doesn't want to do that. She's already been through a lot and I don't want to have to tell her we have to postpone the trip**\n\nI said it twice, I'll say it again Annie wont die if her trip is postponed.\n\nI hope your sister goes NC with you. The only reason I haven't said I hope something similar happens to you is because I know the pain and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.", "\"also not like I can just delay the trip a day \"\n\nExcuses, excuses.\n\nYTA OP.", "NTA. This may sound harsh but you're not oblige to attend and your daughter needs your support, as a mother you prioritized her and I don't see anything wrong. Your siblings must understand you for choosing your daughters over your nephew's funeral.", "Question: the funeral is on the trip to LA week and you cannot come, fine. Will it be possible for you go to visit your sis family before the funeral then and see your nephew for the last time? How hard is it for you to go from your location to your sis location and then to LA? Just would like to understand more.", "You understand that your relationship with you sister is over forever, right?  There will be no coming back from this.  Y\u2019all are done.", "YTA\n\nNo sorry, this is pathetic. I get Annie's hurting, having a partner cheat on you is definitely awful. But all these other comments acting like they *need* to go on a trip to LA right this moment and can't postpone it by a week? Her daughter's health will deteriorate that much if they slightly push a trip back? OP commented they could push it back, but don't want to:\n\n*We technically can push it back a couple of weeks, but Annie doesn't want to do that. She's already been through a lot and I don't want to have to tell her we have to postpone the trip*\n\nCatherine hasn't been through a lot OP? Losing her own damn son and her future daughter in law? This comment from OP:\n\n*I know she would come to one of my children's funerals (God forbid), but I don't think that's a fair comparison. She's much older than me and always had the protective sister thing going on, where she would do things for her siblings whether she wanted to or not.*\n\nRight, so Catherine would drop everything to come to one of your children's funerals but you don't think it's a fair comparison because \"she's much older than me\". Then this:\n\n*I did know my nephew of course well enough, and we were all invited to his wedding next year. But my daughters weren't that close to him because he was significantly older than them*\n\nIt honestly sounds like to me OP would go, but her daughter doesn't want to postpone by a week. If that's the case OP, please teach your daughter some empathy. She's 23. \n\nI'm not trying to downplay how difficult it is to break up with your fiance, but for fuck's sake, try to understand. \n\nYour nephew isn't having a wedding either because he and his partner are both fucking dead.", "YTA. You are not \u201cobligated\u201d to go to the funeral, however, what a lot of redditors don\u2019t understand is when you\u2019re part of a family you sometimes do things you might not want to in order to support them when tragedies happen. It sucks your daughter got cheated on, but your nephew and his partner DIED. Whether or not you\u2019re close to your half sister, you should support her in what is likely the hardest time in her life, losing her child. If you have zero feelings or empathy then go ahead and take your daughter on vacation, but expect consequences for your actions.", "YTA. If your daughter died and and a family member ditched the funeral to go on a trip how would you feel?", "YTA. \n\nIt's great, and sweet that you want to support your daughter through this shocking and painful time; that you want to do something to cheer her up. But, a trip can be postponed and rescheduled. And I get that you're not super close with your sister.\n\nBut someone died.\n\nA funeral only happens once. They can't reschedule the funeral around you. By her reaction, it sounds like your sister is in need of your love and support right now too. And that she was really hoping that you'd be there for the services, and for her during this soul-crushing grief-filled time. And that's where my vote comes in.", "YTA.  There are a lot of different factors in funerals.  There is a difference of a grandparent dies, or a grandchild.  Dipping out on the funeral of an elderly person whose died naturally after a long life is one thing.  But this is someone younger than you; the funeral would take precedence.\n\nIt's not a clear-cut case one way or the other, and I'm sure people will forgive you if you go on the trip anyway.  It's not the worst asshole thing ever, but it still counts as y t a.", "I have a feeling you know YTA! I hope you are ready to have the majority of your family treat you like crap for the next handful of years because that's what you just walked into. You've done nothing but make excuses in your comments which shows that you obviously did not care at all about your nephew. Your sister lost a child and needs the support of her family whereas your daughter's fiance stepped out on her with another person. There is no comparison there. Your daughter will get over that in time whereas your sister will never get over the loss of her child. You're a selfish asshole and so is your daughter. I hope you weren't planning on spending any holidays this year with your family cuz I have a feeling you're not going to be invited. \n\nYTA", "You can\u2019t rebook for your nephew\u2019s **funeral**? And was his partner also killed?\n\nYes, YTA.", "YTA because you admit that 1) you could push back the trip to LA but don't want to do it because your daughter doesn't want to, 2) your relationship with your sister is close enough that she would attend a funeral if the roles were reversed, 3) money does not seem to be a limiting factor in your ability to travel to the funeral. \n\nYour decision to not attend seems to boil down to the fact that it would inconvenient because your daughter doesn't want to change the date of your girls trip.\n\nMaybe it would help your daughter if she were to attend the funeral with you, put her breakup into perspective and reconnect with extended family.", "YTA. \n\nSometimes people are in a situation where it is absolutely impossible to be at two important family events simultaneously. This, is not that. What is the irreparable harm by delaying the trip a week to attend the funeral? Yes, Annie is justifiably sad and upset, but really what's the harm in rescheduling by a few days?\n\nThe harm of not going to your nephew's funeral is the death of your relationship with your sister on top of that loss. She just lost her son and his partner. She's devastated. Don't look for understanding there, she has her own grief to manage and killing your relationship with her at this moment by not going is another burden you're putting on her. Unkind, and you're justifying it because you are blessed with an overabundance of family and don't have a particularly close relationship with her. Other people in your family are going to be disgusted with you over this too, so anticipate a ripple effect beyond the relationship you're willing to sacrifice.\n\nThis doesn't have to be an either/or situation. Moving the trip might be a pain in the butt, however it's possible; you're not cancelling the trip and surely if Annie is reasonable she will understand a short delay for a death in the family - unforeseen circumstances causing a change in plans. You can actually split the baby here. Why aren't you?", "Did you get travel insurance? If so, rescheduling your trip should be quick and easy with a copy of the death certificate. Often just a picture of it will do. Even if you *didn't* get the insurance, most airlines will provide refunds or not charge change fees for a death in the family. The process is just more onerous.\n\nYTA because there was a relatively easy solution to this problem.", "YTA\n\nYour clearly not hurting that much by it or it would be a priority to attend. You\u2019ve said you could push the trip back so there is literally no excuse. \n\nPut your self in your sisters shoes, how would you feel if the roles were reversed?", "YTA. This really just seems as though you would rather enjoy a girls' trip, and has very little to do with Annie at all.\n\nThe woman lost her child. Annie broke off a relationship that obviously wasn't going to be a healthy one had it continued on. The situations are hardly comparable. Especially given the fact that Catherine moved away to a different country. I assume that also means she doesn't have an extended family network she can lean on close by.\n\nYou said the trip is for the four of you. The easiest solution seems to be just having your three daughters enjoy the trip, while you go to the funeral. \n\nYour daughter is old enough to know why a funeral is more important than a cheer-me-up trip, so I don't really see how she could make a fuss over it?", "I get that your daughter is devastated about her wedding being off because she was cheated on. I get that the trip was already paid for. That stinks. However, consider your sister\u2019s feelings. How devastated is she that her son is dead? Your daughter will date again and probably get married someday. Your sister won\u2019t get her son back. She needs you, and I\u2019m sorry to say it\u2019s more than your daughter does after a breakup. YTA. You can plan another trip to LA, and this would teach your daughter something. What it\u2019s teaching her now is that funerals don\u2019t matter, weddings are more important, and it\u2019s okay that your grieving sister might not talk to you anymore after this.", "I was on nah till you said you know him well and was going to attend his wedding next year. You can postpone the trip, annie will get over it.", "YTA: She's being spoiled, she doesn't want to postpone a girls trip for a FUNERAL? Someone is died and it's a heartless not to go.", "I'm not close to my siblings my siblings either.  They all communicate with each other more often than I do.  With that said, if they had a child pass away, I would go to the funeral, at the very least, out of responsibility.  Hard to say that you are the AH because I don't think anybody can judge another's relationship with their family, but I will have to go with a very soft YTA.  Also, if your daughter doesn't support postponing the trip for her cousin's funeral, I would question that as well.", "Yta bc you say the trip *can* be postponed.  It's not trip OR funeral. \n\nI mean, you can def not postpone the trip, but you need to understand you will 100% be damaging your relationships with the vast majority of your family.", "YTA\n\nNormally yes, the feelings of your daughters are more important. But you are an AH for having a great time with your daughters and your sister is grieving in pain and asks you to be at her side. How would you feel, when it would be the funeral of one of your kids and your family would be like \"Sorry, but we want to have some nice family trip instead\"\n\nYou do not attend the funeral for your nephew, you attend for the support of the living family members.\n\nI wonder if you checked all options: How long is the flight between your trip location and the funeral? Your daughters could fly without you, you could join later or maybe travel back and forth or postpone if possible. You could also NOW drive to your sister to lend her a shoulder. Just do anything but a unpersonal video call. \n\nAt least my 2 cents. You had the chance to improve the relationship with your sister and chose do destroy it instead.", "YTA", "YTA 10000% and you raised your daughter to be one too. How horrible to have a sister like you. I can\u2019t imagine my sister doing that to me. Go on your trip because she deserves better than you. Yours and your daughter\u2019s self righteous presence would only add to the trauma of losing a loved one.", "Yta", "OMG, YTA. this tragedy should put priorities into crystal clear clarity. You and your daughters actually have the luxury of being able to postpone a trip and experience it still, you just don\u2019t want to. Your daughter will move on and find someone else that\u2019s not a cheating bastard (I hope) bc she will have the chance to do so. If you were my sister and you did this, you would be dead to me. I would never talk to you, never forgive you and I would make it clear to everyone that you are a self centered person who cannot be counted on and you are clearly raising your children to be the same way. Funerals are not actually for the person who died, they are to help those that lost grieve and feel support around them.", "YTA. Nothing can justify this. If the roles were reversed and your sister called to tell you \u201cI\u2019m sorry your kid is dead, I\u2019m going on a trip that weekend so I won\u2019t be there\u201d you\u2019d probably do worse than what she did.

You can reschedule a trip, your nephew only has one funeral.", "I think it all depends on how close you are. If you're truly not that close, I would say it makes sense to choose your daughters well being over the funeral of a person you barely knew.", "Have Annie and your other daughters go on the trip and you meet up with them later.", "YTA.  Expect a lot of your family deciding to go no contact with you.  I would.", "Wow YTA. \nI really hope your daughter grows out of being a selfish Brat who's mother fights all of her battles. \nCheating isn't okay but he dodged a bullet.", "I get you're torn. If the situation were reversed, how would you feel if Catherine said she couldn't make it to your daughter's funeral due to a girls' trip? How do you think the rest of the family would view Catherine after that? You're also setting a pretty bad example for your daughters. I do believe YTA.

The extraneous details are clearly an attempt to distract and justify.", "YTA its not just about how close you are to someone, its supporting the family through the difficult time and letting them know you care. Im sure the trip could have been rearranged and your daughter wouldve understood. Shoe on the other foot, how would you feel in said situation..", "YTA and so is your daughter. \nIt\u2019s a funeral they can\u2019t be changed. Also you expect would have expected her to drop everything and come to your kids if the same thing happened. Just wow!", "Softly YTA - how I grew up family funerals trump everything else.  In this case your daughter will be OK to wait a week or more for her trip.\n\nEdit to add - I would go solo and not bring your family.", "Wow, you start off by trying to use the whole divorced parents bit to gather sympathy. You're 46 and parents divorced a long time ago. You're daughter was hurting but your sister was devastated and yeah losing a child is not the same as being cheated on. \n\nIt would be one thing maybe if you just flat out couldn't, you allude to being able to you're just not so hurting, maybe no so much.", "I get your reasoning but barring financial pressures related to re-booking the trip and attending the funeral i would say YTA.

I know it doesn't sound great but please read and understand the whole thing.\n\nMy (46f) parents divorced when I was young and they both remarried. I also have two half sisters from dad's first marriage. Bottom line, I have a lot of siblings. While I do try and keep in touch, I'm not close to all of them.\n\nThis post is mainly about my half sister who I'll call Catherine (63f). As I mentioned me and Catherine talk, but we're not extremely close and never was growing up. She also lives in a different country now so don't get to see each other much.\n\nMy daughter Annie (23f) was engaged to her boyfriend of 6 years and the wedding meant to happen this summer, but she found out he was cheating with one of her close friends. Obviously she isn't doing so well and I hate to see her like this, so I suggested we take a girls trip to LA (where she was supposed to go on honeymoon). This trip is just me and my three daughters. This cheered Annie up a bit and she's really been looking forward to it. We've already booked everything.\n\nThere's been a family tragedy with Catherine's son and his partner. This is awful news and we're all hurting. The funeral is the week of our trip, and it's also not like I can just delay the trip a day because I'll be flying there and flying back. I also know Annie's really been looking forward to this and I don't want her to be even more upset.\n\nI did talk to Catherine and told her I'm really sorry, but I can't make it to the funeral, but I'll video call in. Catherine got very upset with me and hung up.\n\nSome of my other siblings are saying I should be going to the funeral and I'm not being supportive.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "EDIT: Iread the comment saying the trip can be pushed back but they dont want too, nevermind definitly YTA\n\n\nNTA but please ask your daughters not to post pictures of the trip for a little while, as that would be insensitive to your sister and extended family. Im not saying pretend that you were not going on a trip just dont flaunt it", "Wait so Annie doesn't want to postpone a VACATION so her mother can attend a funeral? She's the real asshole here. Hate to say it, but if is how she's acting to a family member's death than she probably deserved to be cheated on.", "So I'm coming to this as a parent who lost a child. It hurts. Like, getting your heart ripped out and just living with a hole inside you. And finding out not everyone hurts as much and they can't put the grief for your child above everything else hurts too.\n\nThat said, the nephew can't be helped any more but the daughter can. The living have to come first. Especially since it sounds like the grieving mother has a lot more support than OP's daughter.\n\nThe best thing that can be done is sending something like flowers, a card, sending food (like an Uber eats type deal), and the most important part will come later. Make sure on his birthday and the anniversary of his death his mom gets a card, just letting her know he's remembered.\n\nEdited to fix an autocorrect", "Of course she isn't obligated to attend the funeral but OP admits in her comments that she can change the date of the trip to do both. She could be there for the funeral and also go on the girl's trip. \n\nShe is choosing not to. Catherine did not even react harshly. She got upset and hung up the phone because her kid is dead and OP is like, \"But I have a girls trip to go to.\" OP is a huge asshole.", "If you see the additional context in OPs comment I think you will change your mind.\n\nThey could push the trip back by a week. But they just don\u2019t want too. 23 years old I think lots of us have had long term relationships end around that time of life. It\u2019s normal. People grow up and change. Or you move in after education and realise you actually don\u2019t like this person.\n\nIt sucks that she got cheated on. A trip is a great idea. Postponing it for a week to attend the funeral might actually help ops daughter realise just how small of an issue she has. \n\nMaybe attending the funeral. Which apparently involved an accident where two people died. Will help put the end of a relationship into perspective. At the end of the day her daughter will realise she is better off without this man and she\u2019s learned it before marrying him.", "I think redditors in this part of the thread may have missed OPs comment further down:\n\n>We technically can push it back a couple of weeks, but Annie doesn't want to do that.

Lying to make yourself sound good while you act dismissive about the tragic loss of your nephew is an incredibly self absorbed and tactless choice. \n\nAnnie will be fine taking this trip a couple weeks later.
