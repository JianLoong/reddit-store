When I asked her \u201cwhat happened to my car\u201d she initially played stupid and said she didn\u2019t know what I was talking about and then she finally told me she was backing out of a parking spot and scraped a pole. I got upset, called her a pos and voiced how wrong it was for her to damage my car and hide it behind my back. She said sorry and she was scared I would have flipped out and this is why she didn\u2019t tell me. Ive been in a similar situation with an ex but after I did the damage I felt so bad and made sure I took care of it. She has shown no effort or remorse when it comes to fixing it. I feel like I only got a sorry because I found the damages and confronted her myself, she would\u2019ve never told me. I\u2019ve voiced in the past how id like to keep my car in the best shape and she constantly shows me she doesn\u2019t care by leaving trash in it and staining my seats with coffee or soda, now this. I feel betrayed and so fed up at this point. Last week I had to change my front right tire after a \u201cmysterious\u201d bubble formed and was making my wheel shake. The tires I have aren\u2019t the newest but I know bubbles usually form after impact of some kind. Putting the puzzle together I think something else happened but she\u2019s not telling me the full story, making me even more upset.

Don't be surprised if your insurance wants nothing to do with a potential claim at a later date.", "REd flag my dude.  NTA.  She needs to pay for the damage.

Examine the relationship.", "Respect ???\n\nLike she respects him?\n\nHe should kick her to the curb.", "If you\u2019re in the US, you should know that standard auto insurance does not cover damage or accidents that happen when you are actively working for Uber, doordash, grubhub, etc. It requires a different type of policy so if your girlfriend hits someone else, gets into a wreck, anything that you would need insurance or someone else could file a claim against you more than likely you would not be covered if it\u2019s discovered it happened while she was doordashing and you will be held fully liable and can be sued since you are the owner of the car.

Additionally, if she isn't on your insurance anything she does in your car is on you and if your insurance isn't properly set up for business use you could also incur additional issues or expenses.", "ESH. She shouldn't have kept it from you but you proved her right by doing exactly what she fear you would do. I'm also curious, she already showed you in the past that she didn't care to live up to your standards of car care. Why did you even lend her the car to do DoorDash? I feel this should have been a predictable issue...", "NTA ,  she lied once, she will lie again.  Life is too short to be in a relationship with a liar.", "NTA. Why are you even letting her use it. Leaving trash in it repeatedly after being asked not to was already enough reason not to let her use it", "NTA. Remove the keys from her.", "She crashed your car and lied about it.

I definitely wouldn\u2019t lend her the car anymore and if she isn\u2019t honest about that she may not be honest with other things.", "ESH - she should have told you but I can see her side if she was fearful of your reaction. Your girlfriend (or any fiend for that matter) should not fear you. \n\nYour response was disrespectful and puts you in AH territory. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you two have a healthy relationship.", "Maybe she was afraid to tell you because you yell and call her names?", "ESH. Of course she's wrong for damaging your car and not immediately telling you, and for not offering to pay for damages. She needs to make this right. \n\nHowever, if she was too scared to tell you because of how you'd react, you may need to look at that. Considering you called her a POS instead of not degrading your gf that you're supposed to love, I wonder if you have a problem with anger and calling people names. You really need to examine your behavior.", "ESH. You don't seem to respect each other at all.", ">she was scared I would have flipped out and this is why she didn\u2019t tell me\n\nthis is the issue.  either she's had issues in the past with people treating her badly or you treat her badly.  no one should be scared to tell the truth.  but judging from the fact that you admit you called her a piece of shit, and that she admitted she was scared to tell you because she was scared you'd flip out, one can only assume you do treat her badly.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I know name calling is messed up in any situation but I was so upset and feel it was justified\n\nnot justified.  name calling is never justified.  no matter how upset you are.  maybe you have issues regulating your emotions.\n\nshe should have either told you or taken care of it, sure.  but she's scared of you for some reason.  ESH.", "ESH. She should have told you upfront, but you shouldn't have called her a piece of shit. Both of you are toxic and need to grow up.", "YTA for calling her a POS, not because you\u2019re upset and confronting her. A better response would have just been to express your frustration. It\u2019s okay to be angry with someone when something like this happens, but it\u2019s not okay to call the person you love a piece of shit. A piece of shit is someone who dumps a dog or steals from you, not someone who causes cosmetic damage to your car, as annoying as it may be. \n\nI would still hold her accountable to fixing it though, and also stop letting her borrow your car..", "INFO: dating for 4 years which is a pretty long time, are you guys college students by any chance. I'm going with ESH in regard to her keeping it from you and you blowing up in her face. I get it, I'll be upset too if it was my car. I feel like being with her for 4 years have you bottled up some emotions that finally came out and it just so happen to be your car that was the catalyst for it. FYI, I'm asking whether you guys are college students because of her using your car for DoorDash which there is nothing wrong with it and the fact you wanted to keep it in the best shape knowing you can't really fix it up because you are still a student.", "Yta, getting that upset about a car is dumb", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
