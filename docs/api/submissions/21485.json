I mean obviously it's nice to see clearly but they do feel weird at first. To be honest, I never really got used to mine. I switched over to contacts and eventually got laser eye surgery. I would defo recommend laser eye surgery if you can save up for it in the future.", "NAH. I hate the sensory distraction of glasses on my face and go out of my way not to wear them. That said, be aware that Mom likely has just spent a *ton* of money on your appointment, evaluation, frames, and lenses, and the last thing she probably wants to hear is how much you hate them. I'm sure she cares about your comfort and I agree she could have shown you more patience and compassion, but at that moment she was probably really hoping to hear some gratitude from you.   \n\n\nTLDR: save your complaints for your friends. Thank your mom for your glasses. <3", "NAH\n\nYou were allowed to give a honest response, I think it just threw your mom off. I'm assuming she didn't know you weren't really a huge fan of wearing them and was a bit surprised. Especially since she probably paid a lot for getting the prescription and buying the glasses as well. Her reaction definitely could have been toned down a little but she probably was worried you weren't going to actually wear them like you were supposed to. \n\nI hope you're able to get used to your glasses! I got mine when I was a freshman and struggled with wearing them for a while. Eventually you don't even notice they're on your face and your eyes shouldn't hurt as much.", "Your mother is right about saving your eyes from strain, but you had the right to give the answer you gave when she asked for it\n\nNAH, but you'll be grateful once you're used to them in a couple of months' time", "INFO \n\nHave you had a conversation with her about eventually getting contacts? They aren\u2019t cheap either, but they can help.", "NTA. But obviously wear them regardless.", "NAH. It\u2019s definitely a big adjustment to start wearing glasses and it\u2019s totally fine that you\u2019re not immediately in love with them. But your mom is also right that you need to wear them anyway. \n\nTrust me, if you need the glasses, you need to wear them. Give it a good faith effort to wear them and get used to them. If after a few months you still really hate the feeling, maybe you can talk to your mom and your optometrist about switching to contacts or something. But it\u2019s probably true that you *will* get used to the feeling after a little while of trying it. \n\nEyes are not something you want to mess around with. Follow your optometrist\u2019s instructions and make sure you\u2019re taking care of your eyes.", "NTA. I wear glasses all the time when I'm awake unless I'm swimming or bathing. I don't *like* wearing them. I just can't function without them. It's worth wearing them even though you don't like them, but you don't have to pretend to enjoy it if you don't.", "NTA she shouldn't have asked if she didn't want a true answer", "NAH", "NAH. Your response is reasonable, you've only had them for a day. Your mom is also right; you do need to get used to them.", "NTA. Your mother's reaction was unnecessary, assuming you didnt throw a fit and refuse to wear the glasses. Glasses can be weird and even unpleasant at first. You will get used to them. They probably are expensive (hot tip: Zenni Optical is incredibly affordable) and you should take good care of them, but you are allowed to find the transition period strange. The hardest part for me was getting used to the rear-view-mirror effect in my peripheral vision.", "NTA\n\nI was 13 when I got glasses and felt the same way at the time. The feeling of having something on my face was so foreign and different that I hated it. \n\nHowever after time I got used to it and now it's second nature. Trust me when I say the 2 weeks or so of discomfort while you adjust is so so so so so worth it to actually be able to see. You'll notice a significant improvement in your quality of life. The longer you fight it, the longer it's going to take to adapt, so just rip the band aid off and get used to them. You could also talk to your doctor about contacts, but I HATED those so I just got used to my glasses. Might be worth a discussion for you in follow up appointments\n\nIf after a few weeks you still hate them start stashing money away for laser corrective surgery. That's expensive as hell and your age it might take you years, but if you really hate the glasses it's your only option", "NTA. I have been wearing glasses for a long time. They felt weird in the beginning. I have gotten so used to them in over ten years that it now feels weird not wearing them. You just need to give it some time. And after a while, they still don't feel comfortable, you can look into contacts as an alternative", "You're NTA for telling the truth,  but YTA to yourself.  Your vision will get worse. You will have eye strain and your mom wants what's best for you.  You deserved a lecture TBH.  Wear your glasses.  Ask for contacts if your mom can afford those, too.", "Nah you're not an ahole for answering truthfully.\n\n But moms right. You just gotta give yourself time to adjust.", "cmon dude, usually its toddlers that wont wear their glasses.", "NTA", "YNTA They asked and the optometrist is a doctor who needs to know the truth so they can come up with options that work for you. They are expensive but contacts also exist and your personal preference is up to you. I have had terrible eye sight since elementary school and was genuinely depressed when i first got glasses because it changed how i saw myself so it is important that you are honest so that you don\u2019t hurt your eyes and instead find alternatives", "NTA and mom really overreacted.", "NTA. I've been having eye problems recently and know I'll probably need glasses. I got the Warby Parker 5 day home try on thing and wearing glasses is a big change and I don't like them. Your mom asked, you answered truthfully. What did she want you to do, lie? She is right but she has no reason to blow up on you about the fact you don't like them. I know I'm going to have to wear them soon and know I am not going to like them! That's perfectly acceptable!", "NTA\nIts normal to feel weird and not like your first glasses. I got my first pair at 15 and I hated it but you will get used to it eventually.\nYour mom is the AH in this tho. For her to get offended and berate you like this immediately is not normal or okay.", "NTA. I got my first pair of glasses when I was 2 months old and I still get irritated by them occasionally.", "This is not about the glasses. My guess is she\u2019s interpreting your response as you being ungrateful. Yes you can see. Yes you\u2019re probably glad you can. Doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t take some adjusting or that you can\u2019t feel uncomfortable in them. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. NTA.", "NTA  She asked a direct question and you gave a direct answer.\n\nJust be mindful that glasses are very expensive.  You don't know your parents' financial situation.", "Nta. That's how you feel. Besides, puts not like you said you wouldn't wear them, and broke them or abutting. You just did you didn't like to. I don't get what her issue is. \n\nSadly though, the part she's right about is that you have to wear them. At least for now. It sticks, they're no fun, but you need them. \n\nHere's what might help: \n\nYou could look into contacts. They're not cheap, but when you're older, you could get a job and buy them and then you don't have to wear glasses. \n\nFor now, check out zennioptical. They have tons of cool frames (i got mine from there and they're rainbow stripes!) And they're super cheap. I'm tagging like 30$ including shipping. All you need is to get your prescription and then you can get cheap glasses. And they have a ton of frames so you can find ones that look nice and are maybe lighter on your face, and they won't cost that much so your mom should be alright with it since you can get cheap ones.\n\nSorry that sounds like an ad. But people need to know about cheap glasses that are actually good, lol", "NTA . I was in your position at your age so completely understand. You answered truthfully which isn't wrong, but it will take time to get used to wearing glasses when you've never had them before. It just takes a little patience.", "NTA Tell mama not to ask you anything if you are going to be berated for your feelings.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019ve had glasses since I was in 3rd grade and I\u2019m now going into 11th, so, it\u2019s been a while. Glasses suck, it\u2019s just the truth. They get loose, laying on your side sucks because it digs into the side of your head. I\u2019ve just learnt to deal with it. We all just deal with it (I know that\u2019s not the issue with you.

Since then I wore them nearly every day, with a small gap somewhere arround 7. Grade, because I got made fun of, till I couldn't see the blackboard from my seat anymore and had to get stronger glasses. Not exactly my proudest moment^^' but I get it if you get them later in life and you aren't used to the feeling, its confusing and not so great. But now, I really don't feel them anymore, sometimes I even forget that I wear them, so just get used to them for a while. And what did your mom expect? That you jump with happiness? No, take your time but please don't stop wearing them, they help you^^", "NTA- it took me months to get used to wearing my glasses. You didn't say you won't wear them, you just said they feel weird. They'll feel weird for a while. \n\nJust so you know, the more you wear them the faster you'll get used to them. Now it's the first thing I want in the morning. Give it time.", "NTA for telling the truth.  But you should talk to the optometrist about what could happen if you don't use the glasses.  Will your vision get worse?  You could also ask about contact lenses.", "NTA\n\nI got my glasses fairly young though, but now I actually feel weird *without* them. Mostly because my lenses are so thick, making my glasses heavy, so not having that weight on my face is alien haha.\n\nMy last prescription from over a year ago I was at -11,-10 and not getting better. I\u2019m fully expecting to be blind in 20 or so years hahaha", "Nta I hated how glasses were at first but cause I need them as long as u wear them it\u2019s fine", "NTA.

Hopefully you\u2019ll get used to it! If not there are contacts or you may be able to get your glasses adjusted to be more comfortable.", "Obviously NAH. You're just being honest and your mom probably should have reacted a little differently but it's a pretty mild situation. She was probably caught off guard and expected a generic \"they're okay\" sort of answer regardless of whether you actually liked them or not.\n\nI've had to have glasses or contacts since I was probably 10 years old.\nI wore contacts through most of high-school until I was about 30 and if I ever wore glasses in that time it was usually because I was sick. I got weird bumps under my eyelids (unlikely from the contacts) and couldn't wear them anymore.\n   \nIt's been about 8 years of glasses and for 8 years I still wake up feeling frumpy and unmotivated because of them.\n   \nBTW my glasses recently broke and out of warranty and my insurance only covers a pair every 48 months and I was at like 45 months. I got a copy of my Rx from the optometrist and was able to get some that look good on me online for under $15 delivered. You should let your mum know that glasses don't have to be terribly expensive and maybe you can ask her if she has it in her budget so you could look for another pair or two to give you options for different outfits and maybe a style you feel more confident in. Maybe show her a few you found that you may like that aren't very expensive so she can see that they can be affordable. I found mine at Zenni Optical but there's plenty of websites that offer affordable eyeglasses. \n   \nYou really will get used to them and stop noticing them at all. I don't mind the way I look in them, I just associate them with feeling unmotivated because I spent 15 years only wearing them when I wasn't feeling well.\n   \nI'm not much of a fashion snob but I would spend outrageous amounts on designer sunglasses. I miss not getting to do that anymore but I guess it saves me thousands of dollars. I do have a few Rx ones that I like but it's not as fun as stopping in a Sunglass Hut and getting the latest trends.\n   \nAnyway, I hope you begin to feel more comfortable in them soon.", "NTA. I rarely wear my glasses. I started wearing them 50 years ago. Get contacts as soon as you can. You won\u2019t regret it.", "NTA. My son got his first pair of glasses at 8, he wasn\u2019t a fan either and could not wait to get contacts. He was always very athletic and played several sports so he had a hard time feeling that they got in the way, finding helmets that didn\u2019t smoosh his glasses, or fit okay with them in his face. We saw an optimist regularly, and they told him no contacts until he was 12 or 13. He told us plenty of times how much he hated wearing glasses, and I never thought he was an AH, that\u2019s yikes", "Nta. For the answer of not liking them. You are allowed that opinion. I don\u2019t like wearing mine either. In fact I didn\u2019t wear mine for the longest time. Made my eyes worse. Lots of headaches. Maybe you\u2019ll be able to eventually get contacts and be able to use those. Who knows. But a lot of people don\u2019t like glasses. Eventually you may get used to them but that takes time.

Don\u2019t worry about it.", "Get contacts. I still refuse to wear glasses unless im home. They fog up. They fall off. Etc", "Why did your mom ask so soon glasses take time to adjust to", "NAH. Mom feels like you\u2019re ungrateful because she just dropped a lot of money, you gave an honest answer.\n\nYou\u2019ll likely get used to them. I started wearing glasses as five (I probably needed them even earlier, but they weren\u2019t testing babies\u2019 eyes in the early 80s the way they do now), and have had them for 37 years now. They are a part of my face, and if I wear contacts, I still find myself trying to push my non-existent glasses up.", "NAH, im meant to wear glasses (can\u2019t currently afford a pair) and i hate how they feel on my face, but they will help your eyes, my vision has deteriorated due to not wearing them, wearing them will help you in the long run", "> get used to them\n\nWhat did they expect? You'd get used to it in 24 hours?\n\nIt felt weird for me for weeks before I got used to mine. NTA. You WILL get used to it, but in time. \n\nAlso, saying you're uncomfortable wearing them doesn't mean you are ungrateful for it (unless you put it in an ungrateful way maybe), so them saying you're lucky you got the glasses is just wrong here.\n\nNTA.", "No. I'm an older adult and I don't like wearing glasses even if the glasses are fashionable. Perhaps you can get contacts later OP.", "NTA, as long as you try to get use to them. First time glasses feel weird, but soon if you don\u2019t have your glasses on you feel naked. Video games work so much better when you can see.", "NTA I didn\u2019t start wearing mine until I was required to in order to drive. You have time. Just sit in the 2nd row in class so you can see notes.", "NTA I hated wearing glasses so much (they just slide down my nose and make it feel oily) my parents got me contacts in middle school and I haven\u2019t looked back since.", "NTA, it took me prolly about a year to get used to having the damn things on my face. It's an adjustment and it isn't always a good one for everyone.", "NTA. But your mom has a point.\nMy own prescription is wicked strong, and I\u2019ll be wearing glasses for life. (Contact lenses are not an option for me.) I\u2019d love to not wear them, even though I\u2019ve had them on my face since about age six.\nYeah, it will take getting used to, but be thankful that you now have corrected vision.", "NTA. You didn't say you weren't going to wear them; you said you weren't a big fan. It's going to take some time to get used to them. I speak from the perspective of someone who got her first pair of glasses at around that age. Stay with it. You'll get used to them or maybe you'll get contacts. There are so many things that require good vision, sports, driving, gaming, etc.", "Oh, no, you're so NTA.\nGlasses wearing is a tough adjustment. It changes your actual vision, it can cause dizziness and discomfort, and it changes the way your face looks which is hard to deal with at any time but especially when you are 14.\n\nIt's something you can ease into- wear a couple hours a day or as you need to to start. Work up to it, it doesn't need to be immediate.\n\nI hope you get to a place where you feel neutral about your glasses or even like them and the way they look and help you see. \n\nBut for now, be gentle with yourself as you adjust.", "You may want to look into contacts if your mom agrees. They can be a pain also but they are definitely more comfortable. I have been wearing glasses since I was 8 or so, I feel really weird when I'm not wearing them. LOL.", "NTA. It takes a while to get used to glasses, and while you\u2019ll have to get there eventually, it won\u2019t kill you to take a week or two to get used to wearing them all the time. Nothing wrong with being honest about that fact", "I\u2019m 28 this year and I\u2019ve been wearing glasses for the past 25 years. I fucking hate wearing em. You\u2019re NTA. No one enjoys wearing glasses", "NTA but you do need to wear them :) \n\nWhat about contacts?", "Honestly I've considered getting laser done because I've never gotten used to my glasses either, I can't help but get bothered by them on my face or moving around. \n\nBut sometimes I also like seeing the world in low graphics (I'm near sighted) it feels like less strain on my brain if that makes sense.", "Surprisingly I did like my glasses when I got them. I really love wearing mine now. \n\nOf course OP is absolutely allowed to not like them! I hope they can have the opportunity to try contacts", "What's important to remember is that laser eye surgery is not a long-term solution and needs to be repeated again later on. It's been recommended to me by every optometrist I've seen that you only consider it much later in life because it becomes less effective each time, and repeating any kind of medical procedure multiple times is risky.\n\nEdit: also, NTA, your mom asked for an answer, saying you're uncomfortable and still having to adjust to something that is literally SITTING ON YOUR FACE IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES most of the time you're awake, is a perfectly valid response. I wore my glasses only when I needed them in class, and my eyesight is now at a point where I need to wear them full time, and they still irritate the hell out of me. I wear contacts when I can, but they don't help me with eyestrain when I'm working on my laptop, so it's mostly only when I leave the house that I put my contacts in.", "[removed]", "Ha yes! I was the same, now if I don\u2019t have my glasses on I\u2019m always pushing up my invisible glasses up my nose. It\u2019s a habit I have and don\u2019t realise I\u2019m doing it.", "OP didn't say they're not going to wear them. Just answered how they responded. Being uncomfortable with something vs. not doing it because it's uncomfortable isn't the same thing.", "No where in their did OP say they didn\u2019t wear the glasses just that they didn\u2019t like wearing them which are two very different things. Not liking something and not doing something that you dislike that is good for you are two very different things", "i would never consider lasik eye surgery bc of some of the horror stories ive heard of it. ive heard of people getting migraines so severe/never going away after that they contemplated/attempted ending their live to get rid of the pain. it\u2019s a very very small percent of people it happens to but the risk still scares me", "I'm also near sighted. It was the best grand I ever spent. I had it done in 2009 and if I ever need it in the future, I'll definitely get it done again over wearing glasses. Just being able to swim in the ocean and see everything around me, to hike up a mountain and see the view, it's absolutely fantastic. I love it.", "I did like being able to see clearly but I love activities (swimming in the ocean, mountain hiking etc.) so it's nice to not have to either wear contacts or sacrifice my vision if I'm doing something that's not contact or glasses friendly.", "I'm the same way. I am also so used to my face with glasses on that when I do wear contacts, it's always jarring. OP is NTA and that's why these other options exist!", "I know.

You are well within your rights to think this is awkward, that you don't like them, and that you might not recognize yourself in the mirror for a while you get used to them. But you will get used to them.\n\nBut as an adult looking back, I can see your moms side of things too. She is trying to spin glasses to a positive for you and it will be, because you can see to your potential now.  And she also dropped an almost criminal amount of money on glasses.   You have the right to feel the way you do, and bitch away to friends.  But maybe with mom, we smile and nod this time around.", "NTA\n\nI don't like wearing glasses either.

I first got glasses when I was 13. Hated them...only wore them for half of my 8th grade year. I ended up struggling in high school getting eye strain headaches all the time because I didn't wear them. Now as an adult I have way thicker lenses and astigmatism. My lenses and frames cost as much as a nice SUV car payment. Looking back, I should have just worn them. Maybe some different frames will help you, or are your parents ok with you getting contacts? Please take care of your eyes. You do not want to have worse vision and migraines as you get older. Trust me. Also, take it easy on the screen time (that's advice I gotta take too).", "NTA. I was 8 when I got my first pair, and absolutely hated it. I insisted that I didn't *need* them for like 2 weeks and would only wear them to see the chalkboard at school.

You can dislike something but still do it for your health? My mom is very similar, they want honesty but if there's any inconvenience you're a disrespectful child. You didn't say you hate them and you never want to use them and blah blah blah. You said you didn't like them because they were uncomfortable.

Glasses can be inconvenient at times. \n\nShe might be afraid you won\u2019t wear them after she went through everything to get them for you, hence her reaction. Glasses are expensive.

Yeah, you can get used to them, but there can still be days/weeks it sucks.\n\n\nEven now, it takes sometimes a week or two max to adjust to a new pair of glasses, depending on the new prescription and the new frames.  A big change in the numbers on the prescription; or weight of the materials; or thickness of the materials can all cause me to have to go through a heavy adjustment period that I might be really grumbly.\n\n\nYou're just starting out, OP, which I think others can forget.  And I bet you didn't get much choice in the frames either.  Can imagine what your parents likely spent if they didn't go online with the script, too, since I know what mine run.  \n\n\nSee if you can get hold of your prescription and go to an online eyeglasses shop like ZenniOptical.com; there are several to choose from, I just happen to know and shop from Zenni.  I'd be willing to bet you could find a pair you'd like or love for $50 or less (my own runs an average of $80 as a progressive bifocal, oil resistant coating, AR coating, and tinting).  I typically order a regular pair and sports sunglasses for $150 at a go, which is probably less than what your parents spent on your one pair.  Worth a shot at least.\n\n\nAnywho, OP,  you're NTA at all.

You should see about getting laser surgery done or maybe switch to contacts. I'm 50+ and have been wearing contacts since I was about 18 or so. We could never afford them when I was your age.

You were just being honest! Yes glasses are expensive, but suddenly going from not wearing any to having them all the time is a big change and takes some time getting used to. My son took to it instantly but my daughter is struggling, I just remind her to wear them until she needs a break but to go back to wearing them after an hour. Maybe you should try that?", "I like being able to see far more than I like wearing correction. But they're two completely different sentiments. My myopia is really, really bad. Like glasses started as a toddler bad. Like not even cataract surgery would let me go without correction.\n\n\nI tolerate glasses/contacts for what they give me and I'm used to them because they've been part of my life since before I was fully cognizant. There's nought wrong with disliking them.The money is an investment for what they give you, not for how much you like them on your fact. Mom's being unfair and unempathtic, it's not cool when you will be the one dealing with it until something else can be done.", "NTA\n\nWOW.  She asked if you liked wearing them, you said no because it feels weird having them on your face, and she blew up.  That wasn't kind of her.\n\nPlease allow me to give you the PROPER mom response to that of, \"Yeah, it's weird getting used to something new but you will get used to them after you've worn them for a while.  In the meantime, try to focus on how much easier it is to see things now!  Want to go get some ice cream?\"", "NTA. You had your glasses for a day. It takes longer than that get use to them. \n\nI mean I've had glasses since I was six and, every time I get a new pair, I need a week or two to get used them.", "NTA, either of you. It's normal to not want to wear glasses, especially at your age. \n\nFwiw I really suggest you wear them as much as you can. I didn't know my vision wasn't 20/20 until I was in the army, I was near sighted. Although it was supposed to not get any worst, because I completely ignored the fact I should prob use them, I developed worst eyesight. I need stronger (but still pretty weak) glasses, I just put them on my sunglasses so at least I'll wear them when I'm outside. I have a twin brother, he wore his glasses and now my eyes are a little worst than his I believe. It used to be the other way around \n\nTl;Dr wear your glasses, it'll help reduce them getting worst. It's worth it in the long run, trust me", "NAH. It just takes time to adjust", "NTA. You answered honestly. I\u2019ve been wearing glasses for over 40 years and I still prefer to not have to wear them.", "NTA! It\u2019s totally understandable not to like your glasses at first. I had perfect vision for the first 20 years of my life, and it\u2019s still slowly declining. I got glasses and they gave me small headaches at first. Just remember to take them off when they start hurting you like that, it\u2019s okay to take breaks. And I honestly still only wear them when I need them. The fuzziness of my natural vision is somewhat comforting now.", "NTA, As someone who has been wearing glasses for a few years and was a weird kid who wanted glasses, I can day that they do get annoying. They are expensive as heck, too expensive in some cases", "Nta - I started to need glasses when I was in grade 5. Hated them. Always around my ears and nose was sensitive and got headaches. When I got into highschool, I started wearing contacts and have been for 20+ years. I have cousins that have done laser eye surgery and loved it but eventually needed glasses again. I always considered doing it but was too scared and have a great optometrist now. He was honest and mentioned that if you do get surgery, you won't be able to wear contact lenses later down the road. I'm happy with wearing contact lenses.", "No, but your mom is scared you're going to ruin your eyes, she's scared she's already ruined your eyes, and she's probably worried about the money.

Not everyone likes wearing glasses- thats why they make contact lenses", "NAH\n\nI had exquisite vision right up until I turned 40. Got readers. They helped, irriated the back of my ears and I broke out on the bridge of my nose. Didn\u2019t like it, but still needed them and got used to them. By the time i got to the optometrist, I needed progressives. The grand total was $700. I was so grateful to have vision insurance to pay for the lenses. You\u2019re mom is right, the cost of glasses are expensive. They also do reduce eye strain. It\u2019s normal not to be used to them or not feel like yourself with them on.

All you did was state a pretty common opinion for new wearers.", "i use glasses since i was 13 (now, 24) and still dont like them, its ok\n\nNTA", "NTA, but your Mom is right.  Listen to her.  You'll get used them.", "Your glasses will start to feel natural, but if they are uncomfortable ask to stop back at the store and have them adjusted.  You shouldn't have any slipping  or pressure points, etc", "Nope NTA. Glasses aren't fun or comfortable  and that's coming from someone who had them quite young. That being said you do need to wear them because it does reduce eye strain.\n\nAre you regular near/farsighted or do you have special requirements (i.e. astigmatism) ontop? At your age it should be fine to get contacts instead which won't feel as weird on the face.", "NTA.  You're allowed to dislike them, it's your face.\n\nThat said, your mom isn't \\*wrong\\* per se.  Hopefully you will get used to them.  In my opinion glasses are way better than contacts or surgery for a myriad of reasons.  It's a shame your mom didn't try and lay those out for you instead of laying into you.\n\nIt's the classic bit from The Big Liebowski- \"You're not \\*wrong\\*, Walter, you're just an asshole!\"", "NTA.  There is an adjustment period to glasses.", "NAH. Your mom is right though, even if she was short-tempered about it; glasses *are* expensive, and you\u2019ll be better off wearing them since you need them.", "It\u2019s absolutely normal not to like wearing glasses at first! I\u2019ve been wearing them for 30 years. It doesn\u2019t take long at all to get to the point where you no longer notice them. Just so you know, glasses are expensive, and if your mom\u2019s budget is tight, she may have been hurt by the idea that they would be a waste of money if you refuse to wear them. Wear them and get used to them. Your vision could deteriorate much faster if you don\u2019t see properly.

There will be long term effects of not wearing your glasses it could even make your eyes worse in the long run. it will impact some life milestone\u2026 like driving. For the love of all the other people driving 1 ton 100 kmph death machines wear your corrective lenses. Glasses take time to get use to, but your brain will start to filter out the frame, just like how you don\u2019t see the tip of your nose. Your brain goes not important don\u2019t need to register this information anymore. And if you really hate your glasses you could also get contacts, it\u2019s a question of what do you find it worse wearing glasses or touching your eyeball a few times a day.  But being blindish is a terrible option.", "NTA - you'll get used to it. The only thing she's right about is you have to wear them.

Please wear them so you see how beautiful you and the world is. Give yourself time to adjust. When you're older, contacts will be worth the cost. Always keep a pair of glasses handy, though, for emergencies. Right now, you're still growing, and your vision may alter as you grow. Try the lightest weight frames you can find. I prefer the smallest lens size with metal frames. My eyes are very bad, and these work best for me. I started wearing glasses when I was 12 and know the frustration you're going through (much older now).\n\nShop around when you next need frames for the right color, fit (around the nose, behind the ears, etc.), shape to fit your face as well as your likes.

Once you do you feel naked w/o them.", "I tried contacts a few times, but never got used to them, so I stuck with glasses.  I have astigmatism, so that might have something to do with it.
