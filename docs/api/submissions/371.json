I bused to dash too and sometimes you didn't know you had a tip until the order was completed, so there's a chance he didn't know. Then again he may have said that to see if he could get more money from you. That's why he sucks. Whether he was really in a pickle or just trying to hustle you.\n\nYour husband sucks and acted like a Ken for jis own giggles. He let's stuff get too exaggerated and doesn't care what can happen to others when he goes so far fetched. You need to talk to him about therapy to stop this. It may only get worse and possibly put you in a bad situation.  That's why he sucks.\n\nYou only suck because you didn't stand up to him when he tried pulling all the extra bull crap and called the police when the guy left.", "YTA for calling the police in the first place\u2026I don\u2019t care if your husband told you to.", "Esh.\nThe Door Dash driver had no right to try to guilt you into a larger tip. If he doesn't want to pick up the order he doesn't have to. Your husband was right to report him.\n\nYour husband was being ridiculous to want the police involved. Being a jerk is not a criminal offense. He was really really wrong to lie about what the driver did. If the driver got fired because of what he actually did  - that is fine. But to possibly get fired for things your husband made up is horrible.\n\nYou - you actually called the police when you knew it was unnecessary. You stood there and did nothing as your husband was lying. You are just as guility.", "YTA for calling the cops for something they could never solve", "YTA.

Door dashers And Uber workers are driven by tips.  \n\nHowever, I am less inclined to tip if you are giving me a unsolicited sob story.  I tip what I believe is fair.  Usually (15.00 / 60)x number of minutes it took the driver to fulfill food delivery for me. \n\nHowever, you have a voice to.  You failed to tell the truth. Allowed your husband to slander someone.

You don\u2019t call the police because someone is rude to you. Good grief. \n\nMany of the Door Dash drivers in my area are fairly recent immigrants, and the vast majority are POC - two populations that are often treated very poorly by the police. Calling the police and lying about someone threatening you, which potentially puts that person at risk of a negative encounter with law enforcement, is how entitlement becomes dangerous. You need to take a look at yourself and your husband and really question why you felt compelled to call the police.", "YTA for your role in the whole situation - you keep using the word \u201cexaggerating\u201d but what your husband did was straight up lying. He lied to this persons employer about them being aggressive and dangerous. That most likely cost them their job. You called the police and wasted their time because a contract delivery driver called you rude. All of that is HUGE AH territory. Next time someone says something to you that you or your husband don\u2019t like, either make an honest complaint to the appropriate people or let it go.", "YTA\u2026 and a felon.  You know it\u2019s illegal to file a false report with the police, and I know your husband told you to call, but since you filed the report you are the one that will be arrested if the police decide to prosecute this matter.  YOU NEVER CALL THE POLICE TO MAKE A FALSE REPORT.  Also if you make a habit of this the police will just consider you and your husband crazy people and while they won\u2019t ignore you if they have to make a judgement call on which emergency to respond to first, you will automatically go to the bottom of the list cause you are known to lie to the authorities.  That means if there is ever a real emergency you are now risking your life cause a door dasher was unprofessional.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Wastes police time and resources (which any child is taught never to do)\n2. Puts the Door Dasher in danger from a police confrontation. All the cops know about the situation is what you tell them -- that the dasher is waiting outside your house in a threatening manner and presumably leaves just before they arrive. They now know that you have someone threatening you who knows where you live, and they're going to act accordingly. \n\nYTA for calling the cops. Your husband is an AH for being over dramatic.

I would do the same with other delivery services, however if a driver did this the tip would be significantly smaller.", "My guess is to prevent drivers from only doing high tip orders", "Doordash does this to try and get more people to accept the cheapskate orders that most decline. This is not fair to the drivers or the customers tipping for better service. You end up with this guy delivering to you instead.", "Yes, it was >$5.

Until they have been convicted of a felony they are not in any way, shape, or form....a felon.", "I get that, I used to deliver pizzas in college and most people did that, and I will do that as well.  The difference is I (along with employees of the restaurant they are delivering for) still receive minimum wage and a tip is on top of that.  Door Dashers don't get an hourly wage, and from my understanding the set amount a dasher gets from Doordash per order is very small, so they literally rely on tips.  Having tip information will help a driver determine if the order is worth the gas and wear on their car.  If that information is inaccurate or incomplete it may cause an order to sit or create false promises.", "Alright we\u2019ll it sounds like the dasher may be dumb or just didn\u2019t understand, shouldn\u2019t have been freaking out regardless unless there\u2019s some kind of distance factor we\u2019re not being told about, but I stand by the original point of my comment:  OP needs to get away from her husband", "Good to know", "To give a little bit more when Doordash first came to my area they paid $6-$12 a dash, plus whatever you got in tips (which for me was nothing). I'd make around $60 after 5/6 hours, usually half would go to gas.\n\nWhen they started hiring more drivers it was no longer busy enough to support that level of pay so they reduced it to $2-$5 a dash, plus tips (which again was nothing). So you can start to see why people are acting desperately (even if it is still wrong)."]}
