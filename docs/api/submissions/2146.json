My mom has always worked in creative fields including as a professional writer, so I would not expect this from her. \n\nRecently we both (meaning my mom and her husband, and my wife and I) went to visit my grandfather for his birthday. We were all staying at his house. My wife got up to make some breakfast and came back in tears. She said she overheard my mom and her husband making fun of her and they have her fanfiction profile up, and were reading her work. She said she didn't confront them as she was too embarrassed, and they didn't see her as they were both laying in the hammock thing outside and neither were facing her.\n\nI went out and they were both leaned over my mom's phone giggling. I demanded to know what they were laughing at and my mom said nothing and told me to stop being weird. I told her I knew and she better not lie to me. She admitted she had been reading my wife's fanfiction but said it wasn't a big deal. I asked why they were laughing then. He said \"because it is fanfiction\" and my mom said because it was really poorly written and creepy.\n\nI was like you literally are a published author, and my mom said that is totally different as she is coming up with her own ideas and not stealing someone elses. She said the stuff was just objectively funny and after reading it she was worried about our marriage. \n\nI blew up and said she should worry about her own marriage as her husband married a bitch. I said her whole career was a joke and she thinks she is smart, but she is dumb enough to isolate the woman her son loves. My mom giggled and said I was literally crazy and why can't we just admit fanfiction is lame and weird.\n\nMy poor wife pretty much hid all day and shed some tears over it. I ended up getting my hands on a copy of one of her books as my grandpa's wife had it in her book shelf. I pulled it out at dinner in front of a couple other people and handed it to her husband and said that maybe he should worry about their marriage because apparently my mom wants to fuck her stepbrother because she wrote some erotica about it.\n\nNeedless to say that was an awkward dinner. I told her I'm not talking to her until she apologizes. she said she is sorry but I am crazy.", "created_utc": 1668285657, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ythrm2/aita_for_blowing_up_on_my_mom_after_i_found_her/", "score": 632, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes it does...\n\nIt wasnt nice for your wife to hear this but from your description your parents were outside having a quiet private moment that your wife wasnt meant to hear. They could have been more discrete - but they weren't - give them a soft AH score here.\n\nHowever\n\nYour initial reaction was way over the top and from your own description sounded quite aggressive - you could easily have defended your wife by quietly and rationally bringing this up to your mum and explaining - I'm sure she would have been mortified to have been overheard and an apology - which you write she did eventually make - would have been forthcoming. Instead you went on the attack, blowing it all out of proportion to which your mum became defensive and rightly called you out on your irrational behaviour.\n\nTHEN instead of letting things cool down and talking about it rationally later you instead doubled down on this by escalating the situation further later with your dinner stunt. This firmly places you in AH territory.\n\nI 100% agree with your mothers assessment of your behaviour. You made a mountain out of a molehill and never really gave her a chance to make an apology.\n\nYTA.", "YTA \n\nYour mother is right.
