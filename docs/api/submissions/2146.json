We were all staying at his house. My wife got up to make some breakfast and came back in tears. She said she overheard my mom and her husband making fun of her and they have her fanfiction profile up, and were reading her work. She said she didn't confront them as she was too embarrassed, and they didn't see her as they were both laying in the hammock thing outside and neither were facing her.\n\nI went out and they were both leaned over my mom's phone giggling. I demanded to know what they were laughing at and my mom said nothing and told me to stop being weird. I told her I knew and she better not lie to me. She admitted she had been reading my wife's fanfiction but said it wasn't a big deal. I asked why they were laughing then. He said \"because it is fanfiction\" and my mom said because it was really poorly written and creepy.\n\nI was like you literally are a published author, and my mom said that is totally different as she is coming up with her own ideas and not stealing someone elses. She said the stuff was just objectively funny and after reading it she was worried about our marriage. \n\nI blew up and said she should worry about her own marriage as her husband married a bitch. I said her whole career was a joke and she thinks she is smart, but she is dumb enough to isolate the woman her son loves. My mom giggled and said I was literally crazy and why can't we just admit fanfiction is lame and weird.\n\nMy poor wife pretty much hid all day and shed some tears over it. I ended up getting my hands on a copy of one of her books as my grandpa's wife had it in her book shelf. I pulled it out at dinner in front of a couple other people and handed it to her husband and said that maybe he should worry about their marriage because apparently my mom wants to fuck her stepbrother because she wrote some erotica about it.\n\nNeedless to say that was an awkward dinner. I told her I'm not talking to her until she apologizes. she said she is sorry but I am crazy.", "created_utc": 1668285657, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ythrm2/aita_for_blowing_up_on_my_mom_after_i_found_her/", "score": 1373, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes it does...\n\nIt wasnt nice for your wife to hear this but from your description your parents were outside having a quiet private moment that your wife wasnt meant to hear. They could have been more discrete - but they weren't - give them a soft AH score here.\n\nHowever\n\nYour initial reaction was way over the top and from your own description sounded quite aggressive - you could easily have defended your wife by quietly and rationally bringing this up to your mum and explaining - I'm sure she would have been mortified to have been overheard and an apology - which you write she did eventually make - would have been forthcoming. Instead you went on the attack, blowing it all out of proportion to which your mum became defensive and rightly called you out on your irrational behaviour.\n\nTHEN instead of letting things cool down and talking about it rationally later you instead doubled down on this by escalating the situation further later with your dinner stunt. This firmly places you in AH territory.\n\nI 100% agree with your mothers assessment of your behaviour. You made a mountain out of a molehill and never really gave her a chance to make an apology.\n\nYTA.", "YTA \n\nYour mother is right.

A popular novel at the time.\n\nAll I was saying that famous writer have been making fanfiction for centuries.", "I don't want to look it up either but I'm going to take a stab in the dark and guess it's Supernatural related?", "Actually, it was a Ron/Ginny fanfic. It gives me great pleasure to know that some people keep it alive out there even though CC's tried to have it wiped from the internet.\n\nEdit: actually, I should clarify. The *plot* of TMI was ripped from her Draco/Ginny 'The Draco Trilogy'. The title came from the Ron/Ginny fic.", "Wait what?! OMG", "Ahahaha nope, I just listened to the dramatic reading of this fanfic often with friends in highschool and now the narrator's voice pops up randomly in my head so I will never forget abt my immortal", "Did OP say that in the comment or did he just say that in general his mother is made fun of? (Which of course is sad... I feel for her)", "Wait, hold on now. What has your wife said to your mom? You can't just leave out context like this if you want a legitimate judgement.", "So your wife had no qualms about picking on your mom in the past but now she wants to cry over them giggling at her work? Did you get mad at your wife when she did it to your mom first?", "YTA for dropping this deep in the comments and not clarifying what exactly your wife said for over 2 hours.", "Yeah this is definitely ESH. She \u2018didn\u2019t do anything recently\u2019 doesn\u2019t matter unless she had sincerely apologized and they had made up. They both are being catty, sorry.", "See ao3 always seemed so much less intuitive to me. Like i could figure out ff.net instantly, but to this day I still don\u2019t know how to navigate ao3 successfully", "Hecks yeah.\n\nShe posts it on her Tumblr. Just gotta search \"Sailor Moon\".\n\nOne to get you started: https://at.tumblr.com/seananmcguire/119043147710/319k1nfurro4", "Same, I would read that.", "I was trying NOT to diss fanfiction or writers inspired by other writers.  \nI just feel as if this Reimagination of Jane Austen Genre is a form of theft.    \nExamples:   \n1) Lizzie Bennett is only child and heir of Longbourne.    \n2) Lizzie is pregnant by Darcy, so he has to marry her.\n\nI find the second one offensive, the first just annoying(admittedly only by blurbs).    \nNeither were Austen's story.  I don't care if authors write either of those plots--just don't take Austen's Lizzie to do it(They are trying to get a built-in audience by using her character--but aren't even TRYING to keep her character: Lizzie)  This of course is MY feelings.  Others obviously disagree.", "I've never watched Supernatural. But, I've seen memes and comments online before... oh, God. I figured it out.", "Yes it is, sadly.", "If I recall correctly, Alec was supposed to be Harry.", "He said it in a comment that his wife had done it but it wasn\u2019t \u2018recent\u2019", "I feel like my wife isn\u2019t as mean as my mom but she usually has support so obviously my mom doesn\u2019t like being ganged up on. It\u2019s just my wife gets along great with my step grandma and my moms half sisters and they all like to fuck with my mom", "Wincest was very popular in the early seasons of the show when there weren't any real recurring characters other then the Winchesters. It eventually kind of faded out when Castiel was introduced to the show. I remember those times fondly. The shipping wars were hilarious.", "Yeah, some fanfic pairings are just O-0 \n\nI remember watching The Last Jedi and realizing I could actually HEAR the Kylux BDSM fanfic being written lmao", "omg who's magnus, then??? I need to know immediately. lol", "I absolutely despise the ad system they\u2019ve been on and off with, although not enough to leave. Like, who tf puts a million and one ads in the middle of the text of the \u2018pages\u2019 of a book? Like what", "The implications of that frighten me.", "I vaguely remember the writers (or possibly kripke himself) had stumbled across some wincest and it lead to the occasional gag of Dean and Sam having to say \"we're brothers\" when checking into a motel", "Okay that's pretty funny tbh!!", "*MOAAR!*", "I don't know that he's based on anyone, the author was smart enough (after previous plagiarism scandals) to not do an entirely 1:1 parallel for all the characters \ud83d\ude05 \n\nAnd I'm not even criticizing basing original characters on other characters - whether it's just using an archetype or trope, or someyhing about the character you love. \n\nBut I do think there would have been trouble if she'd imported the entire HP cast in \ud83d\ude33", "Which is why it\u2019s ESH. They both were mean to each other about their work.", "Seriously! Also, it definitely feels like the newer fandoms are on AO3 and most authors have migrated over. Also the purges left a bad taste in my mouth", "ah, I'll make it up myself, then, and say Magnus is Neville. Unassuming, but powerful.", "OP says only that his wife has made fun of his mother in the past, which leaves an awful lot of room for interpretation.  (He also does not specify whether the teasing was about his mother's work.)\n\nThat could be anything from \"lighthearted teasing that went a bit too far\" to behavior that was just as vicious as what the mother did here. \n\nIf it's the latter, I agree with you, that would push this into E S H territory. I'm not yet sure if that's the case.", "Look so long as I occasionally get another flowerpot story, I ain\u2019t too upset lol"]}
