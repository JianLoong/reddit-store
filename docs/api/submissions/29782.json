{"id": 29782, "submission_id": "17hnk6g", "title": "AITA for telling my friend not to bring a child on our scavenger hunt?", "selftext": "Firstly, my friends and I are all around 23-25, with no kids, younger siblings or any future thoughts of kids. In fact, we have often joked about none of us wanting kids, saying things like \u201creason number so-and-so\u201d when we see kids being a bit obnoxious in the wild. I personally do not find kids to be fun to be around, I am an awkward person usually and that amplifies when I\u2019m around kids, find it very hard to talk to them.\n\nWe have had this activity planned out for a few weeks, I won\u2019t get into too much detail about what it is, but it\u2019s a scavenger type thing located all throughout our city. It\u2019s advertised towards adults and families, though all the promotional photos I saw were of adults.\n\nMy friend, I\u2019ll call her Mia, had agreed to let her friend\u2019s 10 year old son join us, without consulting us. I have not met the child, and neither have a couple of our other friends. She told us the night before. Her sister, also a friend, immediately told her not to bring him, as she didn\u2019t want us to be burdened with having to babysit him on what was supposed to be a fun day for us. Mia responded saying that she can\u2019t take it back now, it\u2019s too late and she won\u2019t now hurt him by changing her mind. I understand this, and realize that it would probably hurt him to say no, but we did not agree to have a child join us. The scavenger hunt includes clues to be solved that will lead us to our next location, I\u2019m not sure how difficult they are, but I can imagine that she won\u2019t want us to solve any of them before the kid does, completely ruining the fun around the game for the rest of us. If she had mentioned bringing him earlier, I would have reconsidered going altogether, but now it\u2019s too late as we have our names registered on our ticket.\n\nPersonally, I was hoping to make it into a bit of a pub crawl, by having a drink at each place we were sent to, though I hadn\u2019t brought this idea up to anyone yet. Obviously, we can\u2019t do this now as it\u2019s not really appropriate for us to do that around him. \n\nAfter Mia continually defended her decision to bring the boy in the group chat, I messaged her privately about the situation and explained that I wasn\u2019t interested in spending my weekend with a child, especially because my free time is limited and my weekends are spent doing the things that I enjoy doing. I felt the message was firm yet kind, I added \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f and made sure to explain that I appreciate that she is personally close with the boy, but I think his presence would put a damper on our day. She responded saying that she was sorry that I felt this way but she wasn\u2019t changing her mind, she also mentioned that we would be kind of paired up (others were bringing their partners and I had invited a friend that Mia was also friends with, though I am closer to) and implied that we would be excluding her and that\u2019s why she wanted to bring the kid. Now I feel bad about reaching out to her about this, and potentially making her feel like an outsider.

Instead of letting everyone know ahead of time that she feels \u2018iced out\u2019 when pairs are involved, or, finding a friend or companion to join the group that she can introduce that everyone can engage with, she decides to bring a minor and not discuss it ahead of time to make sure it would be appropriate? Her coping skills need a reset and probably have for a while. As you mention, they won\u2019t really enjoy what\u2019s going on, and worse still, everyone will feel like they need to modify or guard their behavior because a minor is amongst you all. \n\nThis time around, if she feels like everyone is moving along the scavenger hunt without her while stopping at a bar in between or afterwards but she doesn\u2019t feel like she can partake, it\u2019s on her.", "NTA. Mia should have asked everyone if it was ok before she invited the kid.", "NTA I love kids but it\u2019s completely not OK to turn your event into a kids event without getting everyone\u2019s enthusiastic agreement well beforehand. \n\nShe needs to find something else to do with her friend\u2019s kid instead, or do this event with him on her own.", "NTA. The big issue is Mia is trying to make changes and is getting upset that people arent interested in those changes. She gave consent to somebody joining without checking with the group for a group activity. Especially a change she should have known would not be popular. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the group does not want the child to join Mia either needs to make other arrangements for them or just drop out of the activity/do it separately. Expecting the group to just accept it is the AH move.", "NTA. Hang out with your other friends and just ignore her and the kid. Get drunk as hell. You\u2019re not responsible for her stupid choices.", "Is it possible to uninvited her..??", "NTA.  All of you in the friend group who is against Mia bringing the child should leave her and the kid behind and do this activity at your own pace.  If you want to drink at each bar/pub you're at, do it!  This is your time and you're under no obligation to this kid or Mia.  She is the rude, inconsiderate A H in this story.  She doesn't have to change her mind, but you don't have to do what her mind tells her to do.", "NTA. Your friend invited someone to a group activity without checking with other members of the group first. That is bad enough right there, although in some groups it would be just fine. The fact that it is a person in an age group that will negatively impact the enjoyment of the main group (it would be the same if they invited their 90 year old great grandfather) just makes it worse.\n\nMia needs to bow out of the hunt and take the kid to do something else.", "NTA for being annoyed, I certainly would be, but I also think you're over thinking it. It's really unnecessary to expect that the kid will have to guess everything before you're allowed to say anything...he's 10, he doesn't know every business in the area. \n\nIt's going to go one of two ways. Either he's going to be happy just tagging along and getting sodas at each stop while you guys drink (assuming they're not actual bars that he can't enter), or he's going to be bored silly and spend the whole time watching youtube on someone's phone. Either way he'll be relatively out of the way, and now that you've expressed your disappointment with the original invite, I don't think you should let his presence ruin your day.  I don't like kids either but my 9 year old niece can actually be quite fun to hang with now that she's developing real thoughts and a sense of humor.", "NTA. Her feelings are probably a little hurt, but it was her decision to bring a kid to an event that, at least among your group, was expected to be adult only without asking anyone, and it sounds like your message addressed it appropriately without being rude or harsh. Hopefully she\u2019ll learn from this and now that she\u2019s opened up about feeling left out sometimes you guys can talk about it and hopefully won\u2019t have this issue again.", "NTA. You're not the only one not wanting to entertain a kid you don't know. Go and have a good time. When it stops being a good time, leave and go to the pub. This is Mia's deal to manage. It might be fine, so just leave it alone, since you've already voiced your concern.", "NTA. Mia is TA. She bulldozed this kid into Y'alls ADULT get together. She didn't ask, she just told everybody what was happening. I would uninvite her from your group activity. Her & this kid can do things on their own. \n\n*Personally, I was hoping to make it into a bit of a pub crawl, by having a drink at each place we were sent to, though I hadn\u2019t brought this idea up to anyone yet. Obviously, we can\u2019t do this now as it\u2019s not really appropriate for us to do that around him.* Yes, you can. And if she tries to join your group, it'll only last until you hit the first bar :) (I'm assuming kids aren't allowed in bars/pubs) Be firm about this & don't let her guilt trip you.", "NTA.\n\nFor Mia to decide to bring someone else (child or otherwise) so last minute isn\u2019t kind to the group, since you made the plans without considering this. And since it was last minute, it seemed to guarantee the kid has to come because it wouldn\u2019t be fair to change the plans on him last minute.\n\nHaving said that, I appreciate where Mia is coming from. With how firmly you defended your dislike of children, I imagine Mia was afraid of asking the group ahead of time for permission because she knew the reaction she would get. I think it\u2019s a bit unusual to bring a child to not feel isolated during an event like this, so either what she said to you isn\u2019t totally true or she feels so disconnected with your group of friends that she needed ANYONE else to ensure she felt included. Either way, I think a conversation with Mia about how she feels about your friend group would be valuable for her.", "Dude, how expensive could these tickets be?  Eat the cost and just don't go if you despise being around kids so much.", ">as she didn\u2019t want us to be burdened with having to babysit him on what was supposed to be a fun day for us.\n\nHe's not a toddler.  A ten year old isn't likely to be a burden.  He's not going ot need a nap, or a diaper change.  He's unlikely to wander off into traffic.  He'll just be tagging along.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> but I can imagine that she won\u2019t want us to solve any of them before the kid does,\n\nThis seems like a rather unwarrented assumption.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Personally, I was hoping to make it into a bit of a pub crawl,\n\nThis is the real issue.  It's not like you'll be racing around, trying to solve clues as fast as possible, right?  You want to drink a lot.  But since you didn't tell anyone else, how would they know?", "ESH, but quite honestly it sounds like it's all basically resolved. She should have asked in advance, and raised her concern about being a 3rd wheel. You maybe could have been clearer about thoughts like the pub crawl element, but definitely making clear what kind of hunt it was going to be. Agree to communicate better next time, and that nobody needs feel bad.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Honestly go do something else and just east the lost money. Everyone else will have a miserable time since they'll have to keep it pg. So no NTA", "NTA.  If it'll make you feel better I have kids (older now), and I'm not a fan of kids.  I don't want to see 'em or hear 'em or go on a scavenger hunt with them.  I think 10 is young to be doing the kind of thing you're planning.  They will most likely complain at some point and your friend may need to leave and may suggest that the group do something else so the kid can have their way.  Seen it before.  Catering to kids during an adult event.  Nope.", "If Mia still plans on bringing him it is NOT resolved.\n\nIf Mia is of the same mindset as you that may also be an issue", "So she thinks she\u2019s being excluded because adults are bringing other adults so she decides Ms the bring a literal child\u2026.NTA", "NTA. But I feel there's something else going on with the dynamics here. Why did Mia invite this kid? It sounds like she feels a little outside the group in general - saying everyone else would be paired up excluding her (is that accurate about how other events go?), wanting to add a kid when the group as a whole is sort of anti-child (for now - common at that age). Bringing a kid wasn't the right way for her to address that, mind you. Did she get manipulated by the kid's parent to babysit and bring him?", "NTA. \nShe changed the plan without consulting the group. You should just do what you were planning on doing and suggest the pub crawl or whatever else you want to do. Those plans just don\u2019t involve Mia or the kid. She is making herself a third wheel and that\u2019s on her.", "NTA. \nIt seems like you and Mia have both doubled down. If Mia wants to hang out with a 10 year old during a friends scavenger hunt because she felt like she was going to be left out then the kid is her responsibility to deal with. \n\nHer unwillingness to change her mind after members of the group have expressed discomfort means she should know what she\u2019s walking into and she shouldn't have any expectations for y'all to help keep the kid entertained. (It would be great of yall did bit again not your responsibility.) \n\nAs for the pub crawl after, it sounds like there are multiple people in this group that arent the best at communicating, including yourself. If you are still planning to do the pub crawl, I recommend that you bring that up to the group now that way people do not have alternate plans, or they have time to consider what they want to do that day. this will also help Mia know if shell be able to hang out with you all after or if she needs to take the kid home. \n\nIn the future, hopefully everyone in the group will know that last minute additions arent always appreciated even when done with good intentions.", "NTA. Good news is, Mia is now paired up and can do the scavenger hunt with the 10 year-old and everyone else can do the scavenger hunt as originally planned. Springing an uninvited guest is bad manners and there is no rule stating that everyone has to go along with it. \n\nShe says she isn't changing her plans so will not be accommodating you. No one else needs to change their plans in order to accommodate her.", "NTA.\n\nAfter all, you put \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f after your message.", "NTA. Inviting anyone extra to a group event, let alone a child, makes someone an AH. The dynamic will completely change with a kid there. I think you approached it well -  Mia is clearly dealing with her own insecurities.", "NTA. Tell her she\u2019s no longer invited and therefore the kid can\u2019t join either", "This^^^\n\nI have a child and would still be p!ssed if someone unilaterally decided to change the group dynamic by bringing a kid, especially if they hadn't asked first.\n\nI would make it clear, without annoyance, that you aren't comfortable hanging with said kid so will be doing your own thing during the event including having those drinks. Maybe have a chat with one friend to see if they want to join you, although i suspect more than one friend will be contacting you to join in\ud83d\ude03", "Yes, absolutely. If that means Mia has to sit out, that\u2019s on her. Go and enjoy your day and do t make co cessions if you don\u2019t want to", "My thought too", "I would generally find the presence of a 9 or 10 year old added to an otherwise adult gathering a welcome addition, because that's a fun age."]}
