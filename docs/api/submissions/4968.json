A stranger starting at you while you're eating is creepy, period. Your friends don't have your back. He's a stranger, he's not entitled to you or your time therefore it's not rude to slam the door after he followed you and tried to shove himself into your room. You were being too nice, I would've drop kicked him the second he stepped within 10 inches of that doorway.", "NTA\n\nThis guy sounds creepy, and like he lacks any kind of social boundaries. What would make a guy think it's ok to follow a woman he doesn't know to her room?", "NTA. Your friends who think you have a duty to be polite to a stranger who was clearly following you are AHs of the highest order. That\u2019s how women get hurt, because they\u2019re socialized to think they have a duty to be nice to men, even men who are pushing their attention on them when it\u2019s not welcome or encouraged.", "NTA. You have absolutely NO obligation to hear any stranger out, ever. Your safety is your top concern. He gave off creepy vibes and you acted accordingly. Always trust your instincts", "NTA. Replying \"hi\" is no invitation to be stared at, followed, or 'complimented' by a stranger. It's disturbing how women get taught it's rude to leave that situation instead of going along with it for the sake of politeness. And you just know, if you had stopped to chat, you would later be accused of leading him on and being a cocktease.", "NTA \n\nYou put your own safety and comfort first. Being followed to any extent is terrifying, I think I would've reacted the same way", "NTA. Not enough people listen to their instincts. Good job of keeping yourself safe. It doesn't matter if anyone thought you were rude. They weren't there, but you were and your instincts told you to get away. Never doubt your instincts when you think you are in danger.", "Your friends who say you were rude are assholes.\nYou did nothing wrong, guy was a creep.", "Wow, that was creepy! I'm so sorry that happened to you! Can you complain to the hotel? \n\nNTA, by the way. I'd have done the same thing.", "NTA Those who think you were rude need to get some common sense. So many bad things could have happened!", "Nta hell no!  Some dude following you to where you're staying??", "NTA \n\nYou don't owe anyone your company or conversation. Stay safe.", "NTA.\n\nIf he wanted to talk to you, he could have while you were eating. Not be creepy and half stare at you, then follow you back to your room without saying anything. \n\nMaybe he was a creepy harmless guy- but why risk your safety? He could have had a gun, knife, anything. Then the same friends who are saying you should have let him talk would be saying how foolish you were not to listen to your instincts.", "I can\u2019t believe anyone would honestly respond with anything but NTA. The guys that think this is okay (and obviously they do exist) are likely disproportionately past or future harassers", "So so so NTA.\n\nYou felt, rightfully, threatened and you took that seriously. You don't owe him your time or energy. Giving someone a compliment doesn't entitle him to your attention.", "Nope, NTA.  He figured you were an easy target.", "NTA. You are not required to be polite to strangers at all or acknowledge their existence in any way, and especially not when you feel unsafe in a situation.", "Being polite gets women raped and killed - you did the right thing NTA", "NTA- at first from your lead sentence I was wondering but situation says NTA. You might want to mention it to the staff. You may not be the only one he\u2019s bothering. His following you and trying to corner you is not okay.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Perhaps his intentions were good, and maybe you should've tried telling him you're not interested, but he should've taken the hint", "NTA if you don't wish to interact with a stranger you are under no obligation to.", "You did what was right for you.", "NTA. That\u2019s creepy af. Imo if it had been \u2018innocent\u2019 then he\u2019d started talking to you in the breakfast room. Following you towards your room is just Nope.", "I mean. I would have maybe like asked some questions at breakfast so he didn't follow me. \n\nMaybe he just wanted to offer a compliment and then be mildly less creepy. \n\nNTA though.  Gut feels are important and you are just protecting yourself. You don't owe anyone a conversation", "NAH. Considering you're in a hotel good of you to be cautious but man was probably trying to just hit on you and didn't pick up that you were uncomfortable. You overreacted a Lil but can't blame you for it tbh. Maybe if you run into him again with people around see what's up and if he seems like a good guy maybe apologise for overreacting.", "I think you are the asshole for expecting us to believe that your friends called you rude.   That's ridiculous.", "Lets not victim blame.\n\nInteracting with these types of men is dangerous and can actually make the situation worse.\n\nNot sure where you live, but if you live in the city you've probably been warned about what can happen if you respond to street harassment. It only eggs these men on and encourages them more.", "Just curious, are you a man? \n\nIn a situation like that, woman are trained & taught from the time we are babies to ignore strange and possible predatory behavior. Her talking to him would have encouraged him, and he might have gotten bolder. Same reason as to why she didn\u2019t turn around when he was following her - he could have taken that opportunity to harm her.", "Wait. So a creepy guy followed her and you think SHE may need to apologize to HIM?", "LOL \"see if he seems like a nice guy\" like shoving his way into her room after she didn't talk to him isn't a clear sign. jesus h christ.", "Seriously?? What kind of good guy acts like a creeper, staring at someone while they eat and then follows them ?", "Nah, following her back like that after she left abruptly? I wouldn't engage with him at all. Maybe he was innocent, sure. But if he was innocent then all he would have seen is a woman act a little weird in a way that had no bearing on him.\n\nThink of it this way: if he was just minding his own business going back to his own room, what did he see? A woman rush into her own room and shut the door? Well, that's weird, but whatever. He would just be continuing down the hall minding his own business.\n\nThere's a greater risk approaching him, even in a public area with people around, will encourage him to stalk her. Someone that quick to turn a smile into an invitation and decide it's okay to both follow her and try to engage with her as she heads back to her room is far more likely to make a very broken mental connection that she has interest in him and see his twisted fantasy validated.\n\nIt's in her best interest for her to completely stay away from him. If he's truly a good person, he won't notice or care because she's a total stranger making it clear she has no interest in him and he'll move on.", "If you think this guy\u2019s behavior is okay, you need to seriously reanalyze your behavior and talk to some women about their experiences. Gain some empathy!", "1. He's an asshole\n2. She didn't over react\n3. on no planet in no timeline in no alternate universe should she ever intentionally engage with him again, let alone apologize\n4. He's not a 'good guy'\n5. you're an asshole", "I did not victim blame I just stated what I would likely do. Because I have more fear of someone following me /knowing where I am because of past events in my life.  \n\nAs such I tend to try to handle anything in a public situation. \n\nBut also stated a conversation isn't owed.  So not sure where you are getting victim blaming ?  If I am do such please feel free to educate me. I prefer knowing if what I am saying is not coming off how I intended", "I'm not. In a women who has been sexually assaulted before and harassed at my house", "You skipped a lot of words before that part", "He was saying excuse me. Maybe just wanted to ask her out or something? But before that i did say that it was good of her to be cautious because she can't possibly know. And then i said if she runs into him again with people around she could ask what was up during that event and if it was a legit good guy \"maybe\" apologise for the misunderstanding and overreaction.", "Some people do have the social skills of a monkey", "Yea i see your point", "I don't know if you were victim blaming or not. But engaging with him as you suggest just makes things more dangerous if he truly has ill intent.", "Saying I would have done x to prevent y comes across as victim blamey because it implies that y could be prevented. it cannot.\n\nIt's like if someone shared they were sexually assulted and you said\n\n\"I mean. I would have maybe like worn a shorter skirt so guys weren't interested in me\"\n\nWomen get sexually assulted, harassed and followed all the time regardless of how they interact with men. It was his choice to follow her and not her responsibility to prevent that.\n\nBut thank you for being open minded and not defensive.", "I\u2019m sorry for your experiences. Just please be careful of trying to confront. It can escalate behavior instead of de-escalate.", "I don't care what he wanted to do. you don't shove yourself into someones room. PERIOD.", "He didn't shove himself anywhere unless I'm reading it wrong. OP said she threw her breakfast in trash and rushed to her room.

That\u2019s deeply unsettling.", "NTA trust your gut.", "A random man followed you from the lobby of a hotel up to your room and your friends are calling you rude for being afraid!? If this were a horror movie, you\u2019d be the only woman to make it out alive. NTA at all.", "Those people saying you were rude, aren't your friends. This guy is predatory. Also it's stupid that you can't take breakfast to your own room if they're going to rent to creeps like this. NTA, glad you're OK.", "NTA no one is entitled to your attention. You don't have to \"be polite\" and engage with strangers.", "I really doubt that you would have wanted to hear him out. NTA.", "NTA Are your friends crazy? If they say \"hi\" to someone on the street and he follows them to their apartment, to their door and say \"hi beautiful\", they would surely offer him a coffee. Especially because it is a hotel and open for everyone this is so dangerous. It is so easy to get free breakfast at most hotels when you know how they work. Not that his goal was breakfast...", "Fuck being polite. Not cutting off men who are being creeps and trying to avoid being rude has landed too many women in the hospital or the morgue. NTA. Good on you for listening to your gut.", "NTA. Your gut told you to run. Always trust your gut!", "NTA. Your friends are idiots. A stranger with possibly bad intentions followed you to your room. You did not owe him politeness.", "NTA\nWhat a creep", "When he said \u201cHey beautiful,\u201d your reaction was unmistakeable. He knew at that point that his advances weren\u2019t welcome. For him to persist at that point was aggressive and makes me wonder if he\u2019d respect other kinds of clear boundaries. Or if he respects women in any way.\n\nAny decent man knows enough not to follow you like a creep. To desist immediately if you show any discomfort or try to disengage.\n\nYou never owed him any attention, but once he ignored your wishes, you owed him less than nothing. Your obligation was to your own safety. NTA.", "Read \u201cgift of fear\u201d. You listen to your gut. If all the NTA responses on here are aaaall mistaken and he wasn\u2019t a massive creep, then the worst you have done is ignored some one and that may have hurt their feelings\u2026. If they\u2019re all right, the worst thing that could have happened\u2026 well. NTA", "NTA. You weren't interested in dealing with this man. You never know someone's intentions,and staring at you made you uncomfortable,so you had a bad feeling. It's perfectly ok to want to protect yourself and not be interested in talking to him. I think your hotel is an asshole tho,for not letting you take your breakfast back.", "NTA and listen to your instincts! If you think he was being creepy, trust that!", "Have you ever heard of the phrase \"fuck politeness?\" You're absolutely NTA. Trust your gut. Being polite is never worth your safety, and your feelings are more than valid. \n\nThere have been more horrific incidents than can ever be transcribed that occured because someone took advantage of another's kindness. If he hadn't set off alarm bells, sure, if you feel comfortable, be polite. But the second something feels off, you get the hell out of there.", "I'm gonna go with NAH"]}
