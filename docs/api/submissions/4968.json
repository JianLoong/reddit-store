A stranger starting at you while you're eating is creepy, period. Your friends don't have your back. He's a stranger, he's not entitled to you or your time therefore it's not rude to slam the door after he followed you and tried to shove himself into your room. You were being too nice, I would've drop kicked him the second he stepped within 10 inches of that doorway.", "NTA\n\nThis guy sounds creepy, and like he lacks any kind of social boundaries. What would make a guy think it's ok to follow a woman he doesn't know to her room?", "NTA. Your friends who think you have a duty to be polite to a stranger who was clearly following you are AHs of the highest order. That\u2019s how women get hurt, because they\u2019re socialized to think they have a duty to be nice to men, even men who are pushing their attention on them when it\u2019s not welcome or encouraged.", "NTA. You have absolutely NO obligation to hear any stranger out, ever. Your safety is your top concern. He gave off creepy vibes and you acted accordingly. Always trust your instincts", "NTA. Replying \"hi\" is no invitation to be stared at, followed, or 'complimented' by a stranger. It's disturbing how women get taught it's rude to leave that situation instead of going along with it for the sake of politeness. And you just know, if you had stopped to chat, you would later be accused of leading him on and being a cocktease.", "NTA \n\nYou put your own safety and comfort first. Being followed to any extent is terrifying, I think I would've reacted the same way", "NTA. Not enough people listen to their instincts. Good job of keeping yourself safe. It doesn't matter if anyone thought you were rude. They weren't there, but you were and your instincts told you to get away. Never doubt your instincts when you think you are in danger.", "Your friends who say you were rude are assholes.\nYou did nothing wrong, guy was a creep.", "Wow, that was creepy!

A woman rush into her own room and shut the door? Well, that's weird, but whatever. He would just be continuing down the hall minding his own business.\n\nThere's a greater risk approaching him, even in a public area with people around, will encourage him to stalk her. Someone that quick to turn a smile into an invitation and decide it's okay to both follow her and try to engage with her as she heads back to her room is far more likely to make a very broken mental connection that she has interest in him and see his twisted fantasy validated.\n\nIt's in her best interest for her to completely stay away from him.
