No. They can't be generous with other people's money. The airline could reserve seating for cases such as that man's but they don't -- wonder why?\n\nIt's the same with taking payment for any kind of special seating arrangement.

Its an FAA approved harness that wraps around the back of the plane seat (under the tray so it doesn't disrupt the passenger behind you) and anchors the baby to the seat. It is MUCH safer for the baby then being belted to you or your wife and it would solve this problem again in the future.  We also bought a cheapie car seat that was FAA approved for flights and for arrival at our destination so we wouldn't have to rely upon car rental car seats since you really don't know what they've been through. That car seat was light weight and our kids were comfy in it. We'd usually put it next to the window so they could see out the window.", "NTA. You paid for the row of seats.

It might have also been one of the flights where I was in a boot on one leg for a broken foot.\n\nSo there everyone's pissed off at me and I'm having a panic attack because I *DID* plan ahead but it looks like I'm the asshole for trying to get someone to switch with me.

Etihad is completely different from any of those options lol.\n\nI\u2019ve only ever used BA for international travel of 6 hours plus and they were truly awful.
