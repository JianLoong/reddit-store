No. They can't be generous with other people's money. The airline could reserve seating for cases such as that man's but they don't -- wonder why?\n\nIt's the same with taking payment for any kind of special seating arrangement.

NTA.\n\nMy heart goes out to the gentleman with the cane but that does not mean that you bump someone from their paid for seat. And your baby is a someone.\n\nAlso, if you don't want to travel on the flight with a car seat, look into the CARES harness. Its an FAA approved harness that wraps around the back of the plane seat (under the tray so it doesn't disrupt the passenger behind you) and anchors the baby to the seat. It is MUCH safer for the baby then being belted to you or your wife and it would solve this problem again in the future.  We also bought a cheapie car seat that was FAA approved for flights and for arrival at our destination so we wouldn't have to rely upon car rental car seats since you really don't know what they've been through. That car seat was light weight and our kids were comfy in it. We'd usually put it next to the window so they could see out the window.", "NTA. You paid for the row of seats.
