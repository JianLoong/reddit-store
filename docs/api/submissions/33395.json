No. They can't be generous with other people's money. The airline could reserve seating for cases such as that man's but they don't -- wonder why?\n\nIt's the same with taking payment for any kind of special seating arrangement.

Its an FAA approved harness that wraps around the back of the plane seat (under the tray so it doesn't disrupt the passenger behind you) and anchors the baby to the seat. It is MUCH safer for the baby then being belted to you or your wife and it would solve this problem again in the future.  We also bought a cheapie car seat that was FAA approved for flights and for arrival at our destination so we wouldn't have to rely upon car rental car seats since you really don't know what they've been through. That car seat was light weight and our kids were comfy in it. We'd usually put it next to the window so they could see out the window.", "NTA. You paid for the row of seats.

Just because that passenger is under two doesn\u2019t mean you pay less or should have to give it up.", "People are so ridiculous about little kids on planes. We flew home from a trip when my now 15 yo was 15 months old. Paid for her own seat, had her in her car seat. Two leg flight, one about 90min, one 30 minutes. She watched Mickey Mouse with her headphones and made no noise except to say yes when I asked her if she wanted a Pediasure and some crackers. Didn\u2019t even make a mess, because she darn sure wasn\u2019t wasting a speck of her precious Goldfish. Dude in the seats in front of us kept looking back and glaring at us and her. \n\nWe ended up having to change planes at our stop between legs, some issue with the fuel pump at the airport so they had to move us to another flight headed to Reno. But, it took about 45 minutes for the airline to figure that out, so we let her stand and stretch while we were waiting. She then started giggling at her dad, who was making faces to entertain her. Not loud at all, but the guy kept glaring at us and even cursed at us to shut her up. Dude, she\u2019s a toddler, we\u2019re on the ground and she is just laughing quietly! When we transfered to the other flight, he went to the gate agent and started complaining about our existence. I\u2019m not sure exactly what happened, but he never made it on the second flight. \n\nBeen 14 years and I still wonder what was up with that guy, hating on a well behaved toddler.", "> The flight attendant is absolutely an asshole and needed to drop it after asking (politely and in a way that conveys that she knows she\u2019s asking for a favor) once.\n\nThis - that attended need to take NO for an answer and move on. Period. End of story.", "I actually got into it late in life- I was almost 50. I had a friend who had worked for an airline, and she encouraged me. I live in the northeast and am not far from 2 major airports (which are FA bases for certain airlines). \nI checked into who was hiring, created a resume that highlighted my customer service skills and attention to detail, and filled out the online form. \n\nI got an email asking to schedule a screening phone call, so I scheduled that. (One of the questions asked was if you are willing to relocate. This is an important question to really think about because you will be assigned a base that reflects the airlines staffing needs. We were able to pref, but I got my second choice and had to work there for a few months before being able to transfer.) \n\nAfter that phone screen, I got an email inviting me to an in-person interview. They flew me (and 100+ others) out to their headquarters for a day of interviews. When we got there, they checked ID and passport, and we were assigned numbers. There were rounds of group and panel interviews as well as visible tattoo checks (happens less frequently now) and sitting/strapping into a standard sized jump seat. Throughout the day, people were thanked for coming but were not chosen for a contingent job offer. \n\nBy the end of the day, they had a group of us that were offered CJOs (contingent job offers). The contingencies were passing a drug test (happened right after we were told we were getting a CJO), a background check, and inflight training (depending on the airline, it can be 4-6 weeks of training about the job, the aircraft, safety, aviation rules, de-escalation and  for my airline, it was in Florida, so I was away from home for a month). \n\nSo, after I passed the drug test and background check, I was given a date to start training. The airline covered transportation and housing. It's a busy month- lots of information to study, multiple tests (practical drills as well as written) each week and an overall final (had to score 80 or above). We had a graduation ceremony where we got our wings and then flew home. I had to report to my base three days later. I was on-call until I had enough seniority to \"hold a line\". Once that happens, you get to bid on trips and have more control over your schedule. \n\nHope that info helps. If you work 10+ years, you get lifetime flight benefits!", "Yes, that's when it is. It's usually part of the contract that even if you buy a bulkhead seat they can reassign you prior to boarding for a passenger that needs it more. If this dude needed the seat, he should have alerted the airline sooner so they could make arrangements then.", "Why are you so hostile? I just made a suggestion, op didn\u2019t take any offense, yet you\u2019re being rude, making assumptions about my life and calling me cheap", "I didn't say you should.\nI said there were other options, if you'd felt inclined to accommodate, but that if they are going to use the seats that way the AIRLINE needs to plan ahead for that.\n\n(Read it again. I didn't say you did anything wrong.)", "I have seen at least one video suggesting a travel \"hack\" where you book the two outside seats in a group of three (i.e. window/aisle, or aisle/aisle). Then you hope no one wants to sit between two strangers and you end up with a bonus seat to share with your travel partner.", "Again, how is a standby passenger your issue to fix? Hint - it's not!", "But the seat wasn't open, it had stuff on it for the child after takeoff, indicating that the seat clearly wasn't free. The FA tried to tell them that children under 2 don't have seats, and went on to escalate it to the head FA. If he absolutely needed a bulkhead seat and OP wasn't willing to give up the one they paid for for her child, the FA should have asked someone sitting in one of the others if they were willing to move.", "Yeah, this is true.  OP didn't even do it to ensure extra space, or create a more comfortable buffer between her and another passenger.  She literally did not want to have her little mini-me wedged in her lap for such a long flight, and I really don't blame her one bit.", "I will help that endeavor", "This is exactly it. When my oldest was a baby and we flew west coast to the UK a couple times - both trips we booked the bulkhead because that\u2019s where the bassinet goes.\n\nHe didn\u2019t have his own seat until he was 4. Well, this was October 2021 and the US travel ban was still in effect so he had his own three seat section.\n\n(Virgin Economy Delight - free upgrade - 12 of the 72 seats in this class were occupied on the way to the UK, 10 on the way back. I absolutely despised the travel ban that kept families apart but empty planes were nice)", "while i do agree with ur ruling, i don\u2019t think the fact that he wasn\u2019t old makes it any better. you can have chronic health issues and severe chronic pain at any age", "Such as?", "My husband is 6'4\" and not in chronic pain, but STILL makes it his business to be sure he has a seat on the plane that accomodates him comfortably. That's on him, not the flight attendants or other passengers.", "To be honest, anyone who doesn't want to rant when they think about flying probably has their own jet.", "And the airline shouldn't have told him they have a seat,.. when they didn't. I'd be pissed too if I get all the way to plane to then be told oh wait, never mind we tried to put two people into one seat to accommodate you so we could double dip into the wallets.", "It wouldn't have been good for the other passenger either, as he probably would have been kicked too. My son was/is the same. Also, you may have had to get up a lot for diaper changes and they guy with the cane would have too as well.", "Traveled to Germany 20 yrs ago and bought seat for toddler.\n\nNo problem with kiddo in car seat on way out but return flight via Lufthansa and FA said NO CARSEAT.\n\nTried a bit of logic = paid for the seat + physics but FA didn't care.\n\nI was pissed and scared for my kiddo so I thought what can I do to shut this stupid s*it down ASAP? So as the second FA walked up to enforce the policy, I burst into tears and started sobbing about 'my baby'\n\nIt worked. FAs said keep carseat, so I immediately stopped the outburst and we all enjoyed a pleasant uneventful flight.", "It doesn't indicate that at all. At best, it shows that they want to use the seat. But not that it's not free for another passenger if necessary.\n\nIt's like how couples will purposefully book separate seats in an attempt to secure a free third seat because they're hoping no one wants to risk sitting between them. Or when people put their purse on the seat next to them on the bus.\n\nIt's even paraded as a 'hack' on TikTok to get a free seat without paying the airline. Put your stuff there and hope people are too anxious or non-confrontational to ask you to move it. But the seat is still technically open. It's still available.\n\nWe're agreed on this completely. The FA absolutely shouldn't have escalated the situation, and listened to OP, and went around to others. And OP is absolutely NTA. The FA was completely wrong and should've stopped well before they actually did.\n\nBut they didn't specifically target them because they're parents and have a baby. They just saw an empty seat and figured OP & Husband were using it because it was empty.", "Saying the plane would be delayed is a bit dramatic imo\n\nThey could\u2019ve swapped seats after takeoff. Didn\u2019t op say that it was a 10 hr flight? \n\nLook I\u2019m not saying that what I suggested is the perfect solution, it was just an idea", "Oh man my bad. Hilarious you think that makes it better. You could have helped someone in pain, but chose not to. Pretty much definition of asshole.", "I feel like it's unnecessary to make assumptions about the other man in this story. We have no idea what accommodations he may have tried to make prior to this flight. But air travel sucks, passengers are continuously screwed over by the airlines, etc. \n\nTo be clear, I don't think OP is TA at all. And maybe this specific disabled man isn't either. Airlines are TA to everyone.", "Patellofemoral pain syndrome? \n\nI have had issues with this off and on. It sucks.", "I\u2019m very similar\u2026 being in a normal airplane seat without the ability to stretch my leg can easily lead to 2-3 months in a leg brace. That\u2019s why I plan ahead. I pay for aisle seats on the right side of the plane with extra leg room when it\u2019s available, and I don\u2019t ever accept changes to my seating. People with real challenges plan ahead\u2026 we don\u2019t rely on chance when there are serious consequences if it doesn\u2019t work out. This person is totally NTA.", "The worst is when my husband and I paid extra for exit row seats, because he's 6'4 and doesn't fit on planes. And then they changed our plane the day before the flight and shuffled all the seats around, and we didn't get exit row. Or a refund, for that matter.", "But given the nature of air travel and how airlines treat people, it seems very possible that no matter how much your husband plans ahead, there could be issues (like a flight cancellation and getting put on a new flight) that lead to a situation like this. It's unfair and unkind to just assume that the other party is an irresponsible asshole.", "I'm not in any chronic pain but I get very antsy on flights lasting for more than two hours (I just cannot sit still for that long), I get an aisle seat so I can move around and stretch out a bit when possible. \n\nFor a ten hour flight I'd probably have to go business class to be even somewhat comfortable. But that's on me and my wallet.", "Maybe it\u2019s changed as I haven\u2019t flown for a while but the used to force me so much crap about putting my book or magazine away because if the was turbulence I might not be able to hold on to it.  A 2lb book has to go in a seat back but a 15-20 lb baby is fine on your lap.  Isn\u2019t that why have 8 year olds in booster seats because they need to be belted in.  Kids should have a seat period.", "Hmmm, forward facing only? That wasn't our experience and doesn't seem to be correct according to the regulations. From the EASA brochure on flying with children: \"A rear-facing (also referred to as 'aft-facing') child seat is recommended for use in cars for infants and children up to the age of 4 years. A rear-facing child seat can be used on board but can only be installed on a forward-facing aircraft seat\".\n\n(Sidenote: TIL I learned that non forward facing aircraft  exist)", "OP said the plane left 15 minutes late because of the initial request. Asking several people to move would have taken at least that long and most likely longer. And shifting that many people in flight would be chaotic.", "I agree. No need to demonize the other passenger, especially bc it doesn't seem like he tried to fight or argue"]}
