This was completely unexpected but we\u2019re both so happy and excited for this baby to arrive. So are our families. \n\nFor some context, my parents divorced when I was around 2 years old and neither have remarried. My mom (50f) has been in many different relationships since the divorce where my dad (54m) hasn\u2019t been in more than maybe 2 relationships. Growing up, I predominantly stayed with my dad and visited my mom almost every week. I love both of my parents and they both tried their best to make sure I was happy and well taken care of. My dad always had a steady job where my mom bounced between jobs. So my dad paid her child support and helped her out as much as possible so I didn\u2019t go hungry or anything when I was with her. \n\nMy mom and I always butted heads, especially once I got older. We have a pretty good relationship now even though we do argue occasionally. She has always resented my dad though. Growing up she would try and get me to dislike my dad by telling me stories and saying how horrible of a man he is. I think this is a main reason why we fought so much. She hated that I would want to be with my dad or go on vacation with him. While my dad would only speak highly of her and was a great buffer between us when we would fight. \n\nNow to the reason for the post. I found out I\u2019m having a baby boy. When discussing names, my boyfriend suggested we name him the male equivalent of my name and have my dad\u2019s name as his middle name. It didn\u2019t flow right to me but switched around sounded perfect. We both fell in love with it immediately. So we decided to tell everyone the name after a few days. My dad was obviously shocked and beyond happy. My mom on the other hand said she would have preferred the middle name to be first. Understandable, but I thought that would be it. \n\nLast night I went to dinner with my mom. She said \u201cI was very upset when I heard the name.\u201d To which, again, I could understand. But then she said, \u201cIf you have another baby and it\u2019s a girl, she better be named after me or I\u2019m never speaking to you again.\u201d I was completely taken aback and extremely upset. She then followed this up with, \u201cI refuse to call my grandson my ex husbands name. So im going to call him Lex.\u201d Which would be a nickname for his middle name. I didn\u2019t know how to respond to her so I just stayed quiet until we left the restaurant. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot since last night. I talked to my boyfriend about it and he said that she never should have said that to me and I did nothing wrong. But I can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019m in the wrong for upsetting my mom so much. I really love the name and don\u2019t want to change it though. I just don\u2019t want my baby to grow up with his grandmother resenting him because he\u2019s named after his grandfather.

The divorce was 24 years ago. \n\nShe needs to STOP.", "This right here. OP\u2019s mom has been holding on to and projecting this anger and misery for OP\u2019s _whole life_!  People can name their kids w/e! \n\nNTA", "'Thanks for letting me know mom, but since my kid will have a name and that's what we want/expect people to call him, it's a huge shame that you won't be spending time with him'. End of.\n\nNTA", " ali\u2019s feelings, but not valid reactions. \nThreatening never to speak to her daughter again is not a valid response to this. \nTelling her daughter she will never call the child by his given name is not a valid response. \nThese are over the top emotional reactions. \n\u201cI feel like you should name your future daughter after me then.\u201d\n\u201cI feel like I wind be able to my call my grandson that name and would like to use this nickname instead.\u201d\n(Because I am reading this with no horse in the race and no decades long antagonism with exhusband.  So yeah, what she should have said v what she said is easy to compose on Reddit. I hope OP and mom can have a real conversation)", "There\u2019s a lot of things that happened between my mom and I that I didn\u2019t include in the post because it would have been too long. Let\u2019s just say she was very emotionally and mentally abusive to me growing up. One example is that we were arguing over something on the phone and she said \u201cI\u2019m just going to go drive off the side of a mountain because it\u2019s obvious I\u2019m worthless!\u201d Then shut her phone off and didn\u2019t reply to anyone for over 24hours. Meanwhile I was about 12 or 13 thinking I unintentionally killed my mom.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if they were true or not. It\u2019s not right or healthy for a mother to tell a child about their marriage grievances", "I\u2019m honestly unsure if they were true or not. Both sets of my grandparents said it was a complete shock when she left my dad. My mom\u2019s parents tried speaking to her about what happened but she just told them to leave her be, so they did. I never wanted to ask my dad about it because I know he was really broken up when she left. His parents and my mom\u2019s parents told me that he cried for days and begged her to come back but she refused. She had a new boyfriend about a month or two after they split.", "I expected her to be mature about the situation and just say something along the lines of her just hoping the baby is happy and healthy.", "Thank you. There is obvious favoritism and she keeps painting the mom soooo terrible on purpose without providing WHY the mom feels this way. Nor taking into account how her obvious favoritism has hurt her mom", "O yea 100% - thank you for that. I suggested Therapy as its needed to get the mom there", "The mom gets worse and worse to the point where i dont know why contact is maintained or why you would feel like an AH or why you are still trying to cater to her feelings. Thats why i feel there is more to the story. And idk what your dad did to make her resent other than you painting her as a crazy manipulative woman that you still maintain contact with and appease. \n\nNo need to justify the favoritism - you are NTA regardless. \n\nNot asking for more explanation- just feel like the mom is and will continue to be put down while the dad lifted up.", "Then I have to go with NAH. You don't know how valid your mom's side is or how acrimonious that split was.", "Why would you expect this mature reaction if elsewhere you mentioned she was emotionally and mentally abusive towards you?", "I just replied to someone that said I was favoring my dad. My mom was mentally and emotionally abusive to me growing up. I didn\u2019t include too much in the post because I didn\u2019t want it to be too long. One example is her saying she was going to drive off a mountain because she is \u201cworthless\u201d because we were arguing over the phone. Then turning her phone off for 24 hours and not responding to anyone. I was maybe 12 or 13.", "If mom gets therapy this baby is a blessing in another way. Living with all that hate, that you would give your pregnant daughter an ultimatum? Not a happy woman.", "I\u2019m not sure. I guess I\u2019ve always held out hope that things would be different with her one day.", "It was me you replied to. You are painting the mom to just be cray cray and manipulative. No other reasons for her feelings. She has always been crazy and you continue to appease her even thru all this manipulation. And she could be! Either way you are NTA. But just curious why you would even think you are the AH if she is this manipulative and always has been", "For sure not a happy woman. I 100% agree with everything u have said. Take these upvotes \ud83d\ude0a", "Sorry, I must have been reading your comments wrong. As for thinking I\u2019m the AH, a few friends have said I was the AH and should change the name to appease everyone. Even after everything my mom put me through, I still love her dearly. I hate seeing her hurt and knowing it was my fault makes me feel even worse. I\u2019ve always been a people pleaser but this is one thing I really don\u2019t want to change. I\u2019m already so in love with the name and really don\u2019t want to change anything about it.", "You are NTA. No matter what. Its your baby and your name.\n\nI do think Therapy would help your mom A TON. \n\nCongrats on the pregnancy!!!
