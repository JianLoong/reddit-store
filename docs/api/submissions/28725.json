{"id": 28725, "submission_id": "175m71m", "title": "AITA for using a lot of money from my child support?", "selftext": "My parents divorced when I was 8. The custody was split basically in a 70/30 arrangement, and my dad was ordered to pay child support. I recently turned 18, and we started a conversation about if it was necessary for it to carry on or not. My mom was very adamant that it should be continued, and my dad accepted, with the condition that the money was put into a bank account that I could have access to use any time I want. So, we opened an account in my name which both me and mom can have money from. \n\nI have been using it a lot. Mainly to buy courses, uber drives and ordering food. I know it's irresponsible and I probably should manage the money better, but it just feels nice to be able to pay for the things I want. \n\nToday, mom sat me down to have a chat about it. She said that she uses the money to pay for my things and that I can't use it that much. I said that I understood, but that dad said I could use it anytime I want. We argued a bit, and she said that if I didn't learn how to control my spending better, I should just go live with dad.\n\nMy defence is that it's not like I have spent all of the money. Dad is very annoying about saving and how we should always be prepared and etc, so I put a portion of it in a savings account. And even of the money that is left, I spent about half of it. But I do understand that, if mom wanted to do something with the money, she would have to reform her plans to fit my spending. \n\nDad says the money is technically mine to do whatever I want, but that I should be mindful of excessive spending and plan an arrangement with her on how much we each can take from the account. Mom says that I'm still too young to manage that much money and that I don't know what I'm doing. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697051528, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175m71m/aita_for_using_a_lot_of_money_from_my_child/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You literally do nothing and are then using the support your mom gets to house, feed and clothe you on Uber and takeout?\n\nI\u2019m assuming that\u2019s what the funds are for, it wouldn\u2019t be child support if it was just your dad giving you spending money.", "Child support isn't to buy snacks and toys. It's for actual food, roof, clothes... you know, essential stuff. \n\nYou're confusing child support with an allowance. \n\nIf your mom uses the money for the home you live in, the food you eat, and the clothes on your back, then she's using it exactly as it's supposed to be used. \n\nIf by \"courses\", you mean school courses, then yeah, you do you there, but ubers and fun money, just ask your dad for an allowance.", "YTA\nIt costs a lot of money to house, feed and cloth you, plus medical costs, travel, schooling or whatever else and you are then taking the money meant to do that and wasting it on things you don\u2019t need which means your mother is going to be forced to find more money to cover the costs.\n\nIt\u2019s a selfish view to waste the money meant to pay your expenses. You are old enough to start learning about budgets and what it costs to keep you living the lifestyle you are used to. Have a conversation with your mother about money and it might open your eyes.", "YTA\n\nIf your mom has to 'reform her plans to fit your spending',... What's being cut? Less money for clothes for you? For sports? For trips? With the reality being that you will probably go \"oh well, then I'll just take more money out of the account to pay for it myself so that I can still have it\", leaving your mother with even less money for your basics? From your point of view, which will hopefully change, your merely spending the money your father has given you. But reality is that you are taking away your mother's ability to provide for you. THAT is what child support is for. In truth, if she has to reform her plans, she's probably indirectly the person paying for your courses, the uber and ordered food, and that's not right unless she agreed to do so.\n\nYour defense of not having spent all the money is laughable. You're essentially saying \"Hey mom, I'm only stopping you from buying me clothes, shoes and whatnot, but I'm leaving you with enough money to buy me food, so what's the problem?\" I also find it rather telling that you didn't specify how much you put into the savings account and how much your are spending and are leaving your mother with.\n\nYou admitted that you are spending the money irresponsibly. So. Stop doing it. You've had your fun. You've felt the feeling of being able to spend money freely. Now it's time to grow up and to sit down with your mom and make a budget. Essentials come first. If your mom is currently spending money for you on sports and trips and other 'luxuries' you're not particularly interested in, then you need to communicate this clearly so that money can be freed up for your courses and maybe driving lessons and a car. Communication is key. How much money is there, how much should be set aside, and how much can be used for 'fun'? You can be a responsible spender and still have the money to take your courses. (Though the ubers and ordered food are probably a no-go.)", "Info: do you attend school?", "No one asked for it, but I'll update: talked with my mom, more calmly this time. We both apologized and she said that she might have reacted harshly because when she was my age, she had really bad spending habits and almost got herself in trouble because of it, and she was identifying the same pattern in me. We are working out a budget to see how much is going into savings, how much I can spend freely and how much we have to both agree before spending. \n\nAlso, I talked about the job thing. It's still a \"no\" from her haha she wants me to focus on my studies. Maybe next time. Happy ending, I guess!", "INFO:  Are you still living at home?  Do you pay rent, groceries, phone, insurance, car...etc etc?\n\nIf you are living at home and NOT paying rent, it is a bit of an AH move to just celebrate having an account with money in it and leaving your mom to pick up the slack.

Your mother is using that money to house and clothe you but you're making it very difficult for her to do that since you'd rather blow it on fast food. And then what happens if the money runs out? It's not like you'll be able to replenish it; you'll make her carry the financial burden.", "YTA... this money isnt your personal slush money. It's for clothing and education and other needs.

There should be rules and warnings in place before the money was even deposited.", "OP, take a deep breath, and stop spending for 1 week.

Maybe you need to take the money and get you own place. Maybe then you will not find it funny that all of these things cost money.", "ESH\n\nI feel like this system was set up for failure.\n\nGiving a teen unrestricted access to money like this had no chance of success.

If it was government issue the money will go directly to your mom and she can spend it however she wants. \n\nWhat's going on now isn't child support this is a father giving money to their adult child.

You didn\u2019t mention any of those obligations. You are lucky your father agreed to continue- he didn\u2019t have to, you know. It seems your Mom is trying to show you how to use money responsibly. Forgive me, but you are too young to truly understand how hard money is to come by, especially money you don\u2019t have to earn.

There are kids that get kicked out of the house at your age with very little support, even the fact that you are being allowed to stay at a parents home is something you should show appreciation for.", "Then you should pay your mother rent with that money and spend the rest as you see fit", "But without a child you could live in a one bedroom apartment or go flatting with a bunch of people and reduce your costs of living. Child support acknowledges the extra cost of another human being you are both responsible for. Providing shelter, food and electricity for this child is a cost shared by both parents via child support", "Are you 11 years old? Rent and utilities are going to be more expensive when you have a child, so of course child support is going to go to that.", "You really have no idea what you are talking about.", "Alimony is something ***completely*** different and something people can get with or without children. It is related to a marriage contract and usually given to women who did not work in order to support their husband\u2019s career in some way, generally calculated by taking into account how much her own career / earning potential was harmed by doing so. \n\nChild support is awarded to people who, uh, share children with another person. It is meant to alleviate the cost of all kinds of things, ***including*** the increased cost of shelter, utilities, food, and other living expenses (which are of course higher with children than they are as a single person). \n\nIn countries outside of the US, though, these terms are sometimes used differently \u2014 are you in the United States?", "I mean I'm literally a lawyer, teach family law as part of bar prep to students, and my best friend is a family law judge that used to own her own family law practice as a solo practitioner. But please tell me how I'm wrong again. \n\nIf you're maintaining the living standards or bettering the standards because of the child's presence in your home - that is also seen as being something that is to the direct benefit of the child. Paying for more space and the utilities used by another person , maybe a private residence instead of a roommate - all of those are absolutely responsible and appropriate ways to use child support. What universe are you living in that the cost of having a child in a home and all that goes with it is identical to the cost of living as a single person?\n\nAnd it is fully acceptable when you've used extra funds of your own such as to put a down payment on a private home that required a bigger upfront payment - to then utilize child support to help cover some of those extra expenses. The money was already used to benefit the child and making sure that child's parent is also fed, healthy, and using a safe vehicle - all of that is also a benefit to a child. Money that supports the child also supporting an ex spouse simultaneously is 100% appropriate and reasonable because it still benefits the child.\n\nAlimony is spousal support that is completely separate and absolutely a safeguard that protects a spouse's standard of living but that's different than maintaining a living situation that is in the best interest of the child.\n\nYour whole take is very disturbing and messed up.", "No child? Smaller, cheaper place to live, lower utility bills, lower food budget. Child absolutely add to basic living costs, not just extra expenses.", "And you\u2019re an adult you seem to follow what your mom wants a lot and it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s what\u2019s best for you tbh.", "if you\u2019re on a gap year you\u2019re not studying though", "Yeah, if she didn't want to she would probably let me get a job", "I'm 18, my birthday was in september. Plenty of people have suggested the budget thing, so I'll probably do it!", "Sorry, my mom doesn't pay for me on her own. I'm on my dad's health insurance, my dad bought me my phone, my dad used to pay for my school, when I get sick they split the cost of the medicine. When they first divorced, dad used to pay our rent and all our bills because mom couldn't afford it. You can have whatever opinion you want about the situation, but saying my mom pays for me on her own is false.", "Yes, I understand that they have no obligation to keep paying for me, but they want to and do so. It's terrible and completely wrong for these kids to get kicked out, and in my culture any parent that did so would be very much be seen as a monster. I can work on being more appreciative, but I like them because they have always been loving and done their best to raise me, not because they did the basic human thing of not kicking out a child the moment they turned an arbitrary age lol", "Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sheltered I think, I'm terrified to leave my mom's wings haha", "I don't know how else to phrase it. I took a gap year, but I need to get into university next year so I'm studying for the national exam that gets us into university.", "Yes YTA bc of your attitude. You\u2019re ungrateful to both parents. You should be more responsible with the money.", "At this rate, she'll probably encourage it.", "You're 18. You don't have to live there. She can't stop you from getting a job.", "You should get a job anyway. You clearly have no real value of money since your parents have raised you to waste it unapologetically. \n\nGo get some job skills and some life skills and quit acting like your parents should continue to pay for everything. You don\u2019t even give a shit that you\u2019re coming off as spoiled and privileged.", "I didn\u2019t say your mum pays for you on her own. I was referencing \n\n> suggesting that my mom needs my dad\u2019s support to pay for food or basic necessities is absolutely absurd \n\nShe doesn\u2019t _need_ your dad\u2019s support. Great. But you have two parents, one should not shoulder the cost of you alone, regardless of how well paying their job is. The money your dad gives you is to contribute towards what your mum pays for you to live. Not your mum pays for everything out of pocket and dad merely finances your fun money", "Insurance and phone is a tiny fraction of what it costs to house, feed and clothe you.", "Yeah. That\u2019s not healthy, you should probably work on that. Best of luck.", "Maybe some of that money then should be spent on the therapist. It seems like you might have an enmeshed/co-dependent relationship with your mom, which is not healthy.", "Username does not fit", "Okay, and I'm saying mom does not pay for everything out of her pocket, and that my dad does not only finance my fun money. I don't know how it is in other countries, but in Brazil child support is meant to guarantee the same social reality of the parents to the child. Since my basic needs are all taken care of, my child support ends up quite literally meant only for luxuries."]}
