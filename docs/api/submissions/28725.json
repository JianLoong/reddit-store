{"id": 28725, "submission_id": "175m71m", "title": "AITA for using a lot of money from my child support?", "selftext": "My parents divorced when I was 8. The custody was split basically in a 70/30 arrangement, and my dad was ordered to pay child support. I recently turned 18, and we started a conversation about if it was necessary for it to carry on or not. My mom was very adamant that it should be continued, and my dad accepted, with the condition that the money was put into a bank account that I could have access to use any time I want. So, we opened an account in my name which both me and mom can have money from. \n\nI have been using it a lot. Mainly to buy courses, uber drives and ordering food. I know it's irresponsible and I probably should manage the money better, but it just feels nice to be able to pay for the things I want. \n\nToday, mom sat me down to have a chat about it. She said that she uses the money to pay for my things and that I can't use it that much. I said that I understood, but that dad said I could use it anytime I want. We argued a bit, and she said that if I didn't learn how to control my spending better, I should just go live with dad.\n\nMy defence is that it's not like I have spent all of the money. Dad is very annoying about saving and how we should always be prepared and etc, so I put a portion of it in a savings account. And even of the money that is left, I spent about half of it. But I do understand that, if mom wanted to do something with the money, she would have to reform her plans to fit my spending. \n\nDad says the money is technically mine to do whatever I want, but that I should be mindful of excessive spending and plan an arrangement with her on how much we each can take from the account. Mom says that I'm still too young to manage that much money and that I don't know what I'm doing. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697051528, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175m71m/aita_for_using_a_lot_of_money_from_my_child/", "score": 477, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You literally do nothing and are then using the support your mom gets to house, feed and clothe you on Uber and takeout?\n\nI\u2019m assuming that\u2019s what the funds are for, it wouldn\u2019t be child support if it was just your dad giving you spending money.", "Child support isn't to buy snacks and toys. It's for actual food, roof, clothes... you know, essential stuff. \n\nYou're confusing child support with an allowance. \n\nIf your mom uses the money for the home you live in, the food you eat, and the clothes on your back, then she's using it exactly as it's supposed to be used. \n\nIf by \"courses\", you mean school courses, then yeah, you do you there, but ubers and fun money, just ask your dad for an allowance.", "YTA\nIt costs a lot of money to house, feed and cloth you, plus medical costs, travel, schooling or whatever else and you are then taking the money meant to do that and wasting it on things you don\u2019t need which means your mother is going to be forced to find more money to cover the costs.\n\nIt\u2019s a selfish view to waste the money meant to pay your expenses. You are old enough to start learning about budgets and what it costs to keep you living the lifestyle you are used to. Have a conversation with your mother about money and it might open your eyes.", "YTA\n\nIf your mom has to 'reform her plans to fit your spending',... What's being cut? Less money for clothes for you? For sports? For trips? With the reality being that you will probably go \"oh well, then I'll just take more money out of the account to pay for it myself so that I can still have it\", leaving your mother with even less money for your basics? From your point of view, which will hopefully change, your merely spending the money your father has given you. But reality is that you are taking away your mother's ability to provide for you. THAT is what child support is for. In truth, if she has to reform her plans, she's probably indirectly the person paying for your courses, the uber and ordered food, and that's not right unless she agreed to do so.\n\nYour defense of not having spent all the money is laughable. You're essentially saying \"Hey mom, I'm only stopping you from buying me clothes, shoes and whatnot, but I'm leaving you with enough money to buy me food, so what's the problem?\" I also find it rather telling that you didn't specify how much you put into the savings account and how much your are spending and are leaving your mother with.\n\nYou admitted that you are spending the money irresponsibly. So. Stop doing it. You've had your fun. You've felt the feeling of being able to spend money freely. Now it's time to grow up and to sit down with your mom and make a budget. Essentials come first. If your mom is currently spending money for you on sports and trips and other 'luxuries' you're not particularly interested in, then you need to communicate this clearly so that money can be freed up for your courses and maybe driving lessons and a car. Communication is key. How much money is there, how much should be set aside, and how much can be used for 'fun'? You can be a responsible spender and still have the money to take your courses. (Though the ubers and ordered food are probably a no-go.)", "Info: do you attend school?", "No one asked for it, but I'll update: talked with my mom, more calmly this time. We both apologized and she said that she might have reacted harshly because when she was my age, she had really bad spending habits and almost got herself in trouble because of it, and she was identifying the same pattern in me. We are working out a budget to see how much is going into savings, how much I can spend freely and how much we have to both agree before spending. \n\nAlso, I talked about the job thing. It's still a \"no\" from her haha she wants me to focus on my studies. Maybe next time. Happy ending, I guess!", "INFO:  Are you still living at home?  Do you pay rent, groceries, phone, insurance, car...etc etc?\n\nIf you are living at home and NOT paying rent, it is a bit of an AH move to just celebrate having an account with money in it and leaving your mom to pick up the slack.

Your mother is using that money to house and clothe you but you're making it very difficult for her to do that since you'd rather blow it on fast food. And then what happens if the money runs out? It's not like you'll be able to replenish it; you'll make her carry the financial burden.", "YTA... this money isnt your personal slush money. It's for clothing and education and other needs. Not eating out and playtime.  At 18 you should be able to use your brain better then this. At the very least keep a record on where it goes so that you can learn to budget. \n\nYour dad isnt helpful enabling you.

There should be rules and warnings in place before the money was even deposited.", "OP, take a deep breath, and stop spending for 1 week.  In that time, read some financial literacy articles, and ways to grow your money.\n\nMake a long-term goal list, and decide if you need to save up for things like college, a car, a Roth IRA, whatever.\n\nGood luck!", "YTA, reading your responses you think it is a joke that your mom is fully supporting you with a roof over your head, clothes and food.  Maybe you need to take the money and get you own place. Maybe then you will not find it funny that all of these things cost money.", "ESH\n\nI feel like this system was set up for failure.\n\nGiving a teen unrestricted access to money like this had no chance of success.

If it was government issue the money will go directly to your mom and she can spend it however she wants. \n\nWhat's going on now isn't child support this is a father giving money to their adult child.

Having said that - you are 18. Is your Mom charging you rent, making you split groceries or other household bills, what about your phone or transportation?  You didn\u2019t mention any of those obligations. You are lucky your father agreed to continue- he didn\u2019t have to, you know. It seems your Mom is trying to show you how to use money responsibly. Forgive me, but you are too young to truly understand how hard money is to come by, especially money you don\u2019t have to earn. Instead of fighting your Mom, maybe work with her so she can help you develop that understanding.

Can you make it to the next one and have money left over to save? Can you build up a good amount in your savings account? Set goals for yourself. Try to see if you can do it.

You'll start realizing how much things cost and how much of your time those things are worth. \n\nI was selling candy when I was in high school to make money. My mom was a single mother and my dad didn't give child support. It was her struggling on her own. \n\nWhen I was in Middle School and high school, I used to work at a fish market and take the bus home. People would loudly talk about how the bus stunk like fish. I did it and took my pay home to give to my mom and she used it to help buy food, provide a roof over my head and clothes etc. \n\nWhen I was 17, I graduated from HS and went to college. I got 2 jobs, 1 at McDonalds and one at some shady company selling knives. I paid for whatever my financial aid didn't cover. I knew I had to save up for books (super expensive) and for bus fare and if I wanted minutes on a phone...\n\nWhen I moved back home at 18 to go to a more local college, I helped with utilities while I went to school. I took the train to Manhattan and got off and just walked down to each and every store and applied to jobs. I got interviews and took the first one that hired me. I had to pay for what my financial aid didn't pay for to go to school. I would nanny and do that job while in college. I later got a job at a pharmacy and nannied. I took busses, trains etc to get everywhere. I was lucky to be in a big city and didn't need to know how to drive... but even my job at the pharmacy... it was split in 3 locations in 2 different towns. I rode my bike the 45 minutes it took to get to the far away one, the 20 minutes to get to the other one, or the 15 minutes to get to the closer one. I had a change of clothes because that train/bus fare was something I was trying to save on to afford stuff. I learned how to stretch a dollar and how to make food last by not eating out. \n\nI think once you are able to get a job and start contributing to bills, food, etc, you'll understand that you use a certain amount of electricity, you use a certain amount of water, you use a certain amount of gas (or they do to cook your food). Your food and drinks cost money, just having an extra room over not having that extra room costs more money. \n\nHaving a child is not free. They cost money. You cost money. Your dad paid child support to support your mom, because it took 2 people to make you, and he doesn't get to leave all the costs of raising a child on your mom just because he bounced. That is what child support is for, to support your mom in paying for your living expenses. \n\nHonestly, there are some parents who say that if you aren't in school, you can either move out or get a job and start paying rent. You're really lucky you even get to still get access to any of that money. You are an adult now. You are 18 and not in school. You need to learn how to be an adult so that when it's time for you to move out on your own, you won't fall face first, crash and burn. You will need to start learning how to budget, the value of a dollar etc before you move out. And you spending half of the money is way more than you should. You don't need to be eating out or doing uber eats with money meant to support you. You are literally not doing anything to support yourself and you're making it harder on your mom by spending as you do. You need to get a job and make your own money, and after you pay for some bills, then you budget your money and see how many times you can order uber eats or whatever. But you first need to make your own money and start supporting yourself. You are 18 now, and there are children younger than you who are working. Heck, at hospitals, I see little 16 year olds working as CNAs. If you want a job badly enough, you will find one, even if it's a cashier, a shelf stock person etc at your closest grocery store.
