You answered. I see no problem.", "Yea, you were in the wrong. Next time just grow a spine and be clear.

That makes me think that is a sticking point or has validity somehow.  I agree the person is harassing him, but to me there were so many more insults that could have been used instead of race unless there was a reason for it.", "Maybe fair enough. I think its on the line.\n\nIf the post was flipped and it was \"YOU'RE BLACK\" I think most people would shift to the other side a bit. \n\nAlso I think saying \"You're X\" can have *more connotations than just an ethnic preference in dating*.", "Idk I think \"YOU'RE WHITE\" sounds like there's more there to me. \n\nBut its not like I know OP so who really knows.", "In general, yes. But the definition of racism is to discriminate on the basis of race. If you are being discriminatory towards white people on the basis of their race, that is racism, by the definition of racism.", "Really?  In my experience bigotry is usually applied towards race or religion so would still be applicable but I don't see why it would be a better term. For instance, Cambridge Dictionary:  \n\u00a0  \n*the fact of having and expressing strong, unreasonable beliefs and*  \n*disliking other people who have different beliefs or a different way of life \u00a0/ strong, unreasonable ideas, esp. about race or religion:*  \n*religious/racial bigotry*", "also : behavior or attitudes that reflect and foster this belief : racial discrimination or prejudice\n\nYou conveniently left out the rest of the Miriam Webster definition. It\u2019s literally right under what you put. \u201cRacial discrimination or prejudice\u201d. So yea you can in fact be racist to white people. System racism and racism are not the same.", "Your definition proves my damned point.\n\nIt's not purely the dominant race--it can be any race (and in different situations the dominant race changes--the streets of harlem have a different dominant race than some random tiny town in Louisiana)", "\ud83d\udcaf", "Why you getting so vexed for? You don't actually think everyone who isn't attracted to all races is racist do you?", "Ehh it kinda does because the skin colour is the most noticeable thing out of everything you just listed. You\u2019re either dumb or ignorant. Or both. It\u2019s not racist to not be sexually attracted to someone based on skin colour. It is racist to treat those of different skin colours unequally in terms of simply being a civil human being. Being sexually attracted to isn\u2019t the same as treating someone equally and being civil. Get that through your head.", "I get what your trying to say but it's not that simple, saying \"I don't find a certain race attractive\" is a subjective sentence said subjectively which is the main reason its not racist. While it does exclude the people within the race that they would find attractive cause there's always exceptions to the rule kinda logic, the fact it's a subjective view means its obviously a general view. And everyone has their own preferences for all kinds of traits not just race. So saying \"This certain race is unattractive\" is a subjective sentence said objectively and it's the objective nature of the sentence that makes it racist... cause that's what racism is, a subjective (fucked up) view viewed/talked about objectively.", "I don\u2019t know what his thought process was, I\u2019m responding to the rest of your comments. His reaction sucked, but I\u2019m unsure how it\u2019s bigoted to not be attracted different types of people. Preference is preference, but it does become bigoted when it\u2019s rooted in fetishisation, which reduces different races to stereotypes instead of treating them like people. We don\u2019t know about any of that here in the OP. Is everyone supposed to be attracted to all people?", "It's normal, I'm not sexually attracted to Asian women doesn't mean I hate them. You don't have to want to fuck someone to treat them with respect.", "You really don\u2019t see the difference between wanting to be with someone sexually and being friends with someone? I have gay friends, but I wouldn\u2019t have sex with them. You know why? BECAUSE I\u2019M NOT ATTRACTED TO THEM. But with your logic, you probably think that\u2019s homophobia\u2026", "Because context is always relevant?\n\nShe was harassing him after he repeatedly told her no. At that point, he said the most extreme thing he could think of, to shut her up and get her off his back. Then she played the victim.", "Yeah I think maybe he's an AH for snapping like that and the way he said it doesn't look good. It could be construed as racism as you're correct there's other connotations. But to me with the context I don't think it is. \n\nAnother way to flip it is what if a white man prefers to date black women, is in OPs shoes and does the same thing. In that situation i don't think anyone would call him racist. \n\nUltimately flipping the situation and talking about something that didn't happen rather than what actually happened seems a little pointless though.", "From the post it just sounds OP said that to get her to back off, since this girl has pulled this stunt multiple times.", "No racism is also based on power and oppression even at an individual level, which is why if you\u2019re discriminated against as a white person it\u2019s simply discrimination and prejudice. \n\nMade a quick search and found these two articles that explains it more in dept:\n\nhttps://www.verywellmind.com/the-psychology-of-racism-5070459\n\nhttps://www.thoughtco.com/racism-vs-prejudice-3026086", "Do you actually know any BIPOC or LGBTQI folks? \n\nRacism is not practiced against whites, including the Irish, at this point in time in the US.

In the Western world as a whole, this would be white people.", "I don\u2019t feel vexed.  I\u2019m just discussing my perspective.  Yes, I think it\u2019s racist to exclude any race from dating.  \n\nIf you say \u201cI refuse to date blank race,\u201d you\u2019re a racist.", "Ehh, it kinda doesn\u2019t.  From a sexual standpoint, tits and ass are way more noticeable than skin color.  Anyone who bases their dating decisions on race has a really narrow view of life. \n\nCall me some more names lol.", "Because it defies biology to exclude certain races from your pool of attractiveness. \n\nNo one race is confined by a single feature. In other words, you can find all different body types and features in every race.  \n\nSo, even if you\u2019re only attracted to certain body types, those body types transcend race.", "I never said you hate them.  Excluding an entire race from your dating pool is illogical, nonsensical and bigoted.", "Context is always relevant; but not all information is context And he certainly did not say the \u201cmost extreme\u201d thing to serve as a deterrent.

Systemic racism is just racism in institutions with power. Systemic racism is built on normal racism (i.e prejudice against specific race) but has an additional power factor that can oppress people. Normal racism is just simply racial prejudice or discrimination. Such as racial stereotypes. Normal racism can occur for white people because, as the definition says it\u2019s literally racial discrimination. White people however don\u2019t experience systemic racism.\nNormal racism doesn\u2019t require some form of power and doesn\u2019t require said person to be oppressed, system racism does.", "So everyone who isn't sexually attracted to black people is racist you've got to be joking.

I get that you have your preferences and perhaps for you skin colour doesn\u2019t matter. Good for you. But it\u2019s not like that for everyone. You still don\u2019t understand that being attracted to someone isn\u2019t the same as simply being civil and kind to someone. You think being kind to somebody means you\u2019re sexually attracted to them? Everyone has the right to be treated equally and fairly. But not everyone can expect everybody in the world is sexually attracted to them lol", "Yes, of course there are different body types across all ethnicities. However, you are also defining attraction by nothing else but physical attributes. I don\u2019t know how you roll, but generally personality, attitude, values, etc. play a part.
