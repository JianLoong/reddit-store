Not because it isn't serious, but because our society also teaches men that they can be lustful or angry and nothing in between.\n\nSo, you can raise your concern, but you will need to be able to prove ongoing harrassment from this woman to genuinely make it stop. Any text messages, dm's, spamming your instagram posts, compile them. If you have friends you can talk to, clue them in about what's going on. Ask them if they can make sure you're not left alone for the time being so that she can't corner you again. Make it very clear that this is unwanted attention that is making you uncomfortable. Because the deck is stacked against you. Unfair, but true.\n\nI don't envy the position you're in. My guess is you've been trying to be polite about it for years because she's white and because that puts you in a precarious situation. Hell, she's already trying to play the victim here.\n\nYou're not racist, OP. You're the target of sexual harrassment and you don't need to justify \"no\" to anyone. I hope this situation gets resolved quickly and in your favor.", "NTA, rejecting someone cause they aren't your type isn't bullying. Harassing someone consistently because they won't date you and trying to get them in trouble *is.*", "NTA, I don\u2019t like most white women either for this exact reason. Lots of white women don\u2019t seem to understand boundaries with POC men and it\u2019s annoying, and for her to go on social media to say you\u2019re racist just shows her views, watch your back and make sure people know you\u2019re not suicidal.", "NTA \n\nWhen it comes to sexual attraction for most people yes skin tone does play a part just like gender. Nothing about that is racist. If the girl wants to play that way then take it a step further and report her for sexual harassment.", "ESH/YTA You didn\u2019t need to make this about her race. Imagine if the tables were turned, how would you feel?", "first off NTA people here are too focused on the \"you're  white\" line which was a valid answer to her question why you don't like her\n\nbut i will fully support you to go full blown AH and replied to all her social.media attempts to slander you, and yes its slander. \n\nlike imagine pulling a reverse uno and clarifying that she hounded you for 4 years even after your first \"no, im not into you\" then following up with the continuous unwanted attention, (especially if you have evidence of said repeated attempts).. then saying if this was reversed you be tried for sexual harassment already.. and also pointed out (again) that she wasnt your type and you said this to her as explanation in the nth time she pursued you...\n\nyou are 18 bro...taking a hit in your socmed/reputation to clarify something like this is waaaay better in the long run and cancel her pity party campaign against you early.\n\noh and clear everything up with the authorites at school too...\n\nlmao at the entitlement:\n\n>she reported me for bullying)", "Yta for being a racist not for being harassed.  But I don't believe this story", "I'd say that \"historical context\" is one of the few reasons not to date someone based on their race that ISN'T acceptable. People aren't their ancestors. Preferences are fine, you aren't attracted to white people? No problem. But to base your dating preferences on how someone's ancestor treated yours is just insane to me.", "So let's just lump everyone into categories based on skin color? Idiotic comment. Leave race out of it", "Idk why you're being downvoted. There are people who purposely hit on married people because of the thrill of getting them to cheat. It's super common to not gaf if someone is in a relationship.", "It's a massive double standard popping up recently.", "Why?", "That's not even what racism means???", "But it still sounds crazy both ways. Nobody deserves to be a slave so it still works?", "\u2026 you do realise that plenty of white people were slaves and absolutely experienced oppression and trauma?", "Here's the Google definition:\nprejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, *typically one that is a minority\n\n*Not always.\n\nNone of that says white people can't be discriminated against because of race", "None of which has anything to do with dating preferences lol", "This is just blatantly false. People of different races have different physical characteristics even outside of the skin color.\n\nIt's why Polish people don't look like amaericans even though we're both white.\n\nI don't find most black women attractive BUT the ones I do find attractive, are easy 10/10s. It has nothing to do with skin color or \"social norms\".", "NTA - You are allowed to have your preferences. Hopefully you can report her harassment of you.", "not only YTH but also racist \ud83e\udd22", "YTA, 1 - for being racist, 2 - for not letting her know you are already committed.", "I'm a white female and with you 100%. If you're not attracted to white girls then you're not, it's nothing to be ashamed of. The white girl sounds like an absolute bum hole and in reality, her vile behavior and ego did you good because if you had of got together with her then her tantrum is a red flag, you'd have been far better...and safer...off without her. Best of luck to you.", "NTA, she was sexually harassing you.", "NTA, but it's time to escalate this to the adults. She needs to leave you alone. Tell the principal or school counselor your side of the story, and see if they can help you navigate this.", "ESH. You are not really an AH, you are a racist. The other is a harasser.", "NTA. But, you could have just yelled \u201cyou\u2019re not my type\u201d again, instead of making it about her race. Now you\u2019ve turned her into the \u201cvictim\u201d. Try not to let your emotions get the best of you.", "NTA, she was sexually harassing you and should have just left you alone once you made it clear you weren't interested. You're still young, learning to navigate these types of situations is hard, turning people down is always awkward and it's easy to get flustered", "NTA, it was deserved!", "NTA, it was deserved! and screaming \u201cyou\u2019re white\u201d is funny as hell idc the only people mad about it are the white people that\u2019s how u know ur fine \ud83e\udef6", "NTA, her trying to call u racist is so infuriating bc you cant even be racist to white people. she\u2019s mad u called her white but SHE IS WHITE so what now \ud83d\ude10", "NTA, but you don\u2019t ever have to explain yourself. She was looking for a reason to attack you for rejecting her.", "Everyone saying AH or ESH would say different if the gender roles were reversed. \n\nNo means no and she didn't take no for an answer. She kept persisting and you reacted. \n\nShe was badgering you to explain why she wasn't 'good enough'.. and you picked something she can't change..\n\nWas it nice... no.... but she kept badgering you. \n\nNow if she says anything, does anything, comes at you in any way.. report it", "I think the race issue has gotten out of hand and has become an overwhelming sensitive subject. NTA, a person should be able to play the race card in some situations and be respected for their choice.", "He\u2019s not asking about it turning into an \u201cuproar\u201d, he told us the scenario, he should have been kinder in his rejection to her, but her blasting him on social media and calling him a bully is going to far. This type of behavior happens far too often with white women. We all need therapy, clearly, to get to the root causes of this.", "Yeah, seriously. Him creaming is fine. \n\nIf it were a boy sexually harassing a girl over an extended period of time before escalating to the point of cornering her and demanding romantic attention, would you seriously tone police her response? Or would you agree that she does not owe it to him to be nice? Good for the goose, good for the gander.", "Honestly, if that black girl had been sexually harassing the white boy and had now cornered him? I see that exactly the same way. Doesn't matter which way around skin colour or gender are, someone was harassed and trapped, they're allowed to raise their voice to protect themselves. When 'no', 'I'm not interested', 'please leave me alone', and 'I said no', don't work, all you can do is try something else.", "He said four years in another comment!! Ugh I would have broken down long ago and said much worse.", "Genuine question here:\n\nWhat does WOC mean?", "Anybody not wanting to date a certain race is ok. People can fuck who they like and you can\u2019t police their sexual preferences", "No. This is deeper than that. If it was a casual asking out and turn down, they probably would have been more tactful. Like they would.have just said they weren't attracted without mentioning race. But this chick sounds annoying as fuck...so the OP needed something jarring to get them to back off.", "As a Mexican women I can assure you it's the exact same thing whether you want to admit it or not.", "This. I seriously doubt he would have said what he did if she wasn't harassing him.", "As a Black woman, I wouldn't in this specific instance. That lady sounds horrible. She should have taken the first thousand no's at face value.", "I (white girl, at the time 20) got called racist by a black man (looked like 40) because he asked me 15 times in the span of maybe not even 10 minutes if we wanted to be friends and I told him no every time. And I'm not exaggerating. I was standing at the bus stop when he approached me, bus came in 5 minutes, he followed me on the bus and went off the next stop in the same city (so couple hundred meters further) after a intimidating looking guy overheard us and gave him a look like he's not gonna survive if he doesn't leave immediately. So thanks to that guy.", "Woman of colour", "WOC stands for woman of colour", "woman of color i believe", "Nope. You want equality you treat people equally.", "There\u2019s different forms of racism that only people from minority groups experience.\n\nI genuinely suggest you look more into this. Try looking into institutionalised or systemic racism for a greater understanding of the discussions about how race interact with power.", "I am confused. Why is it different?", "I would normally agree if this lady wasn't a harasser. \n\nYou see, under normal circumstances, a simple \"I'm not attracted to you\" works. Op got pushed to the edge.", "Ah, thank you.", "Thank you.", "Two others confirmed. Thank you. :)", "It is often just a case of being attracted or not to someone physically to start with. \nPeople are allowed to have a type.\nAnd that type can include skin colour and gender.\nAnd if you're allowed to have a type, you are allowed to have an anti type.", "Since when has what MLK says been the definition of what racism means? \n\nWe have dictionaries. Suggest you look up the word racism in one. You can also look up institutionalised or systemic racism if you want to understand how hierarchies of power interact with racism.", "So what is prejudice based on race against white people to you then?", "If a black person doesn't want to date white people it's generally because they want to date someone who can relate more to the experiences and struggles that are unique to being black. If a white person doesn't want to date black people they don't have that kind of issue, it's more a matter of thinking less of black people whether it's consciously or subconsciously.", "No problem :)", "First part of your comment, fine. Second part, no. I have dated white, black and latino men (Im Latina). The same way there are some white people I am not  attracted to, there are Hispanics Im not attracted to, and there are African Americans I\u2019m not attracted to. It\u2019s not about the race - it\u2019s about so much more. Personality, body type, intellect. You clearly have your own bias and your own prejudice. You are the one being racist here.", "No, they are the same thing just different terms. Both are used.", "Anyone who says racism experienced by white people is as bad as that experienced by minority ethnic groups is obviously wrong.\n\nThat\u2019s not what the person you\u2019re replying to said though. They said white people can experience individual racism, not that it\u2019s as harmful or destructive as that experienced by black people or other minority groups. \n\nWhich is just a fact based on the definition that racism is just prejudice based on race.", "Of course there are some you aren't attracted to. But if you were universally not attracted to black people then that's racism and you'd need to take a look at yourself to figure out why that is.\n\nYou literally made the exact point supporting what I've said and can't see that because you're determined that you think I'm wrong.", "same logic applies. if your preferences is dating black people, it doesn't make you racist just as having a  preference to date men/women exclusively doesn't mean you're sexist\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f"]}
