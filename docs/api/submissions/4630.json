He admitted to it after she told him that she was pregnant though it ended in a miscarriage. Until recently I had no idea who she was as he wouldn\u2019t say who she was. I\u2019ve been working with Spencer (41M) for nearly 17 years, and we are best friends. There are no secrets between us, or at least that\u2019s what I thought. He\u2019s married to Elinor (33F), they have been together for 9 years, married for 8.  \n\nIt has recently come out that Elinor is the woman Will slept with. It came out because I had wrongly thought that Will was cheating again and he countered with that it was possible for him for him to be friends with women and not sleep with them, as he was friends with Elinor and hadn\u2019t slept with her again. He then admitted that Elinor had been the one that he slept with. I was hurt that he hadn\u2019t said anything before we had become good friends with her and allowing Spencer to get involved with a woman who was happy to sleep with married men.\n\nWhen I saw Spencer at lunch the following week, I told him about Elinor and Will. Spencer wasn\u2019t shocked at what I told him, he already knew. He had known for 9 years. Elinor had told him after the first time we had a double date, she was single at the time and she no idea Will was married. As far as Spencer was concerned it was more Will that was at fault that Elinor but I see them as equally being at fault. Spencer said that he hadn\u2019t told me because he didn\u2019t see the point in opening up old wounds, as we had worked past Will cheating. Elinor hadn\u2019t said anything for the same reason.  \n\nI sent Elinor an angry text telling her that I knew about her cheating with my husband and that I didn\u2019t want her coming around anymore. I told her that I didn\u2019t trust her and that she should have told me that she slept with my husband. Elinor just replied with \u201cI understand and I\u2019m sorry that for any hurt I\u2019ve caused you and your family.\u201d She\u2019s not responded to any other message I\u2019ve sent her about wanting to know more about her cheating with my husband.\n\nWe were meant to be having Spencer, Elinor and their kids around for Christmas as its our turn to host. Today, I\u2019ve told Spencer that I don\u2019t want Elinor to come and have uninvited her. Spencer and the kids are still invited. He has said that if Elinor is not welcome then they will not be coming and thinks I am being unreasonable. He also said he knows I\u2019m upset but hopes that I can move past it. Will is upset that I\u2019ve uninvited them, as he thinks it will ruin Christmas for our kids not getting to see their friends as planned, plus we have far too much food in for a family of 4. Will thinks I am overreacting as I was fine with Elinor before I found out.\n\nAITA for not wanting to have Elinor at our Christmas? I just don\u2019t think I can see her anymore, knowing she is the one my husband cheated with.", "created_utc": 1670953166, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zl1ny4/aita_for_uninviting_my_friend_and_his_wife_from/", "score": 316, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Spencer and Elinor have had 9 years to process this. You have not. You have just been sideswiped and betrayed again by knowing that the woman you trusted and befriended - and trusted your husband with - is also the woman he cheated on you with. All three of them have failed you by keeping this information from you 9 years ago when she first realized. I'm not going to blame her for the affair if she didn't know he was married when it happened, but she did know he was married when she met you, and she and Spencer together decided not to tell you and to build a friendship.\n\nI don't see a come back from this for you, Spencer and Elinor unfortunately. My comments on your marriage are also pretty negative. Spencer is obviously not going to keep coming around and bringing his kids around whilst his wife is banned, and I don't know why you're blaming her more than him or your husband anyway as all three betrayed you in their omission.", "I'm really not understanding all the Y T A judgements.  The fact that all 3 of them have \"moved past\" the cheating is irrelevant- this is brand new information for you. And the fact remains that chances are, if you had known it was Elinor your husband slept with, you wouldn't have pursued a friendship with either her or her husband in the first place.\n\nYour husband is absolutely the one at fault for cheating- Elinor didn't even know he was married, after all- but all 3 have deceived you by not telling you the truth. Only you can make the decision as to whether you can continue your friendship with either of them- and imo Christmas is going to be too soon to make that decision. NTA", "NTA and I'd divorce. \nEveryone knew but you... They are not trustworthy and not what I'd call friends. \nAs for your husband? I'm lost for words and-trust me-that barely happen. \n\nPs. If she didn't know at the time, she's not the one to blame. She didn't marry you-he did. He should be faithful, not her.\nBut this going on for years now? I'd out them all of my life. Sorry", "NTA what's wrong with the sub today /every day?\n\nFor the dense people. Yes, she has chosen to forgive him that's the reason she can't uninvite him.\n\nBut there is no reason she has to sit through Christmas with the ex affair partner of her husband. And all people knew except her. So it's not like they were angels.\n\nFfs these people here.", "I would've dumped the cheater at first confession. I have a zero tolerance for that sh--", "NTA in my opinion but seriously? Your husband was ok with this woman being around like this and continuing to lie? Omitting truth is lying. I\u2019d move on with your life leaving all of them and all of this nonsense in your dust.", "NTA at all. It\u2019s not fair that everyone else knew and not you. To find out you\u2019ve been friends and formed a close bond with someone that slept with your husband and none of them tell is just awful. I don\u2019t blame you to be fair. Husband is to blame for cheating but all 3 of them are to blame for keeping it from you.", "NTA. Quite frankly, your husband had no right to not tell you who he had an affair with way back then. Obviously you wouldn't have become friends with this couple had you known. He allowed this friendship to grow and develop, knowing the truth the whole time.\n\nYou're not overreacting and the kids will get over not seeing their friends just this once. Don't ban your kids from being friends with her kids but definitely have nothing further to do with her. Obviously her husband and kids aren't going to come to a get together without her. Consider donating excess food (before you cook it) to a local food bank if possible.", "Your husband is the AH here. Elinor told her partner from the start. It was up to your husband to tell you. He was unfaithful, and then when he had the chance to do what was right the SECOND time, he decided not to tell you.", "I\u2019m not going to pass judgement on you, but if I were in your shoes, I\u2019d be upset with all 3 of them and would cut ties with all of them. I\u2019d feel like the 3 of them had this cruel inside joke behind my back for all of these years. I don\u2019t understand why you aren\u2019t the most angry with your husband, though. He\u2019s the one who is vowed to be loyal and truthful to you. He\u2019s the one who betrayed you the most.", "NTA that's some malicious and sneaky shit. I would cut them all off and divorce the husband. He literally flaunted his affair partner in your face for YEARS and she just went along with it.  Neither one of them has remorse. I highly doubt she didn't know he was married, she just wants to seem like less of a bad guy. Fuck them.", "NTA.\n\nThose people were collectively gaslighting you for YEARS by lies of omission.", "NTA.  Astonishng that your husband, Spencer and Elinor all kept you in the dark for a decade.  Allowed you to build friendships you never would have accepted.  I am not sure how you can trust or love any of them again.  Your husband is of course the worst offender.  As I don't know your familial or financial or emotional situation with your husband,  I can't say what you should do in relation to him.  But cutting off Elinor and Spence seems obvious.", "\u201cI can be friends with a woman and not sleep with them look at E! Oh wait\u2026 I did sleep with E.\u201d Funniest way for that to come out cuz he not only told on himself but proved himself wrong. NTA but I will say it\u2019s not the girl you need to be taking it out on.", "NTA.  Why do you have to get passed it again with your husband, Elinor, and Spencer have all lied to you by omission for a minimum of 9 years ?   Answer is at some point but it's up to you. All three showed dedication to that lie and broke your trust in the process.    Also, Spencer isn't a friend of yours and was only looking after for what is best for himself.  Time to have serious conversations with your husband and make new friends.", "NTA but this is why you divorce cheaters.", "Huge NTA. That\u2019s huge news, of course you don\u2019t want to spend Christmas with her. You deserve some time to think, and your husband should be fully supporting this. He fucked up completely. You have no responsibility to a friendship with someone your husband cheated on you with, regardless of your relationship with him. Those are two separate relationships. Also, your kids will be fine. They\u2019ll find other friends. Using them as an excuse to minimize your feelings is gross.", "INFO: Why are women so quick to forgive their husbands but always want to take it out on the other women? (Would love the specifics for you and your situation).", "NTA - but everyone else in this story is, most especially your husband! How could he let this go on for all these years without telling you. And Spencer, your alleged best friend is also an AH. Elinor is probably the least of the AHs in this story, but even she bears some blame for befriending you under a lie of omission. You deserve better. Kick your husband out and kick the rest of them to the curb.", "NTA because I understand the hurt considering how fresh this is and how uncomfortable the gathering would be. However, your husband should be the focus of your hurt and anger, not Elinor. I can certainly understand not wanting Elinor around, but if she legit didn\u2019t know Will was married then that\u2019s not her fault. That is your husband\u2019s fault - he purposely let someone believe he was available when he was not, and he made a conscious decision to engage in infidelity. I understand being upset with Spencer, but again, it is your husband\u2019s responsibility to say something. I\u2019m sure it feels like everyone deceived you, but it\u2019s really all your husband\u2019s doing. He is the one that betrayed you - he should\u2019ve been forthcoming about who Elinor was. He is the one that has culpability here. \n\nI do think the friendship development and dynamic between your husband, Spencer, and Elinor is very weird considering: 1. Your husband let Elinor believe he\u2019s single and cheated on you with her 2. Elinor miscarried his baby 3. Elinor found out at some point that he was married and decided that despite being lied to, or misled, and going through a terrible ordeal (miscarriage) that she\u2019s ok being really good friends with him, and 4. Spencer knows all this and is also ok with the situation. \n\nAgain I think you\u2019re NTA, but YWBTA if Elinor bears the brunt of this when it 100% should be your husband.", "NTA for not wanting Elinor at Christmas. I wouldn\u2019t either. But she and Spencer are a package deal so you will have to cut ties with both of them. Your husband is hugely TA for cheating, not telling you who it was then allowing a such a friendship to form with his affair partner. Elinor isn\u2019t TA for sleeping with him as she didn\u2019t know but she should have told you or not have pursued a friendship with your family.", "Seriously?\n\nNTA, and maybe you should uninvite your cheating husband. So terribly sad that his literal FUCKING around should lead to the family's finding out.\n\nAnd if her husband knew and was fine with lying to your face for the last 9 YEARS, then he's also a giant AH.\n\nClearly it wasn't \"worked out\" when everyone else involved waa busy still lying and covering up from YOU.", "NTA: For the last 11 years you\u2019ve had one single person to be angry at for the affair; you\u2019re husband. YOU were the one who decided to work through it and forgive your husband. That was a choice you made and decided upon as is you\u2019re right. He is definitely the AH for allowing this women into your life knowing who she was and not giving you that choice to make on your own.\n\nFor the affair it\u2019s self, Elinor is not to blame. She was lied to and deceived as well. What you can blame her for however is coming into your life under false pretenses and also making a decision for you that she had no right to make. Then pretending to be your friend? Yeah no. \n\nYour \u201cbest friend\u201d is also messed up. He is correct that the affair was your husband faults, but to start how could he your supposed best friend date and later marry the women who was the AP knowingly. While he had obviously make that choice he as well took the choice from you to decide what you were okay with and continued the lie. \n\nAll these people took away your choice once again 11 years later. How could anyone blame you for your hurt feelings now? Your husband betraying your marriage again. Your best friend allowing you to be made the fool. And the women who you trusted, how could she hide this from another women? \n\nSome AHs are bigger then others but without a doubt they all deserve the title.", "NTA, but I'll suggest that Elinor is not \"equally at fault\" as Will. If she was single and didn't know that he was married, then the affair is 100% on him. Not being told about this secret that all of them knew for nine years is really crappy on all of their parts. It's still fresh right now, so I don't blame you a bit, but maybe over time, you can learn to forgive them all. It really would be best for your own peace of mind, IMO, but it's your call.", "NTA. Your husband is the major A in this situation though, not just your \"friend\". What a fucked up situation", "Your husband made his vows to you. Not the affair partner. You're angry at the wrong person, and you should be directing it all to your husband. You should tell him you uninviting the couple didn't ruin Christmas, his cheating did. You're angry because you found out a new piece of information, and it's as if it's happened all over again. He's at fault for not coming completely clean.\n\nI think you have the right to write the affair partner out of your life as she did sleep with your husband, whether she knew or not only you can decide how you feel about that... It does come at the cost of losing your best friend. But you should give your husband more grief. He's the most in the wrong, and I think you know that. He is supposed to be loyal to the one he married. Not a 22 year old that old man approached.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Regardless of when it happened, the wound is fresh for you once again since you just learned who the AP of your husband was. For 11 years you didn't have a person aside from your husband to be angry with. Your husband is the AH for misleading Elinor that he was single and for cheating on you then. \n\nI wouldn't be too angry with Elinor and Spencer though - Spencer is right that your husband was more to blame that time for his lie of omission. Is he obliged to tell you? It is tricky - it's not his place, even if he's your friend. He does have an obligation to protect his wife. Should he be angry at his wife? No, because it happened before they were an item. Again, your husband should have told you about the details. Don't ask it from Elinor, you're only wanting fuel for your anger. She's not obliged to tell you. She has her own family to take care of. YWBTA if you keep insisting she tells you what happened. If you have already forgiven your husband for that transgression, after you've done some thinking, you may want to start the same process for your friends. But explain to everybody how much learning about that detail hurt you, and you need the time and space to heal once more. You are within your rights to uninvite them for Christmas.", "NTA\n\nThis is two separate issues.\n\n1) betrayal of husband for allowing you to become close friends with his AP.\n\n2) Betrayal of close friends who knew this information and opted not to tell you and then built  close friendships making you belive you can trust them. Your whole friendship with Elinor is based on a lie and Spencer has hurt you.\n\nYou need to question your marriage. What man knocks up someone, admits it and then keeps a relationship of any shape or form. He kepted his relationship with Elinor and that's a new betrayal. Why are you with him still? Why are you allowing him to call you a AH in this? You moved pasted the cheating, this is a brand new breach of trust and one I definitely wouldn't move on from.\n\nI think you need to question your self worth. Why are you married to this AH and why are you still best friends with Spencer when he also betrayed you badly. You have boundaries with the one woman in this situation, but them men can do whatever they want and you accept it.", "NTA. And I would lay a modest bet that Will is in fact cheating again, probably with another 22 year old.", "NTA tbh I would get rid of all 3 of them! How dare not one of them tell u years ago. How can u trust ur friend again after keeping this secret for so long, 1st thing u did was tell him when u found out. Also i don't understand how you let ur husband back after him refusing to tell u who it was. Even if the women who slept with ur husband didn't know he was married she should still have told u. U are surrounded by sneaks and lies.", "NTA- people you trusted all withheld the truth from you. They intentionally deceived you. I can understand you feeling like the scab was ripped off your wound, but this shows you\u2019ve never healed or really forgave your husband. Additionally, you seem to be excusing your husband and having more anger at the woman- who didn\u2019t even know at the time that he was married. \nYou\u2019re punishing her when she didn\u2019t really do anything wrong by sleeping with him- she thought she was sleeping with a single man. And yes she\u2019s wrong for withholding the truth, but that\u2019s it. Your husband is guilty of much more", "NTA\n\nI can't believe they *all*  hid what happened for a decade. \n\nThat is an absolute betrayal...by everyone.\n\nYour husband is the worst though, you can be mad at your ex friend, but your rage should be directed at your husband the most.\n\nWhy he isn't becoming an ex is beyond me.", "Omg they are all terrible people! The only ones being unreasonable are them. Absolutely disgusting. NTA idk if I could forgive any of them\n\nEdit: typos", "NTA\n\nThey were all hiding a secret from you. A secret about an ordeal that surrounds a betrayal of trust. \nObviously you are angry at all of them. Your husband for obvious reasons but it makes perfect sense to also be angry at your \u201cfriends\u201d for not revealing this to you. It is the minimum expected of them.\n\nYour feelings are totally valid.", "NTA; these three people lied to you for years. They all \u201cgot over\u201d the affair because 1) they had known all the details and 2) could decide for themselves to look past it and 3) be friends anyway. You knew nothing. It\u2019s sickening.", "NTA, but the person you should really be upset with is Will. Elinor was just as much a victim of Will's deception as you - she had no idea he was married at the time.", "NTA. Dump your husband and dump Spencer.", "\n\n>Will thinks I am overreacting as I was fine with Elinor before I found out.\n\nWould your husband still be fine if he found out his best friend for example was a murderer?\nI dont think so.\nNta", "NTA I personally wouldn\u2019t want any of these people around me, including my husband. No one seemed to think you deserved the truth.", "ESH.\n\nYou seem more mad at your friends than your husband for actually cheating and for actively hiding from you who it was.\n\nElinor may not have known at the time, but she sucks for pursuing a friendship after she found out. Spencer should have informed you, or again, not pursued a deep friendship when it was apparent you didn't know, but Will is definitely the biggest AH for encouraging all of this and acting like because you didn't know before and you were \"fine\" with it that everything should continue as-is.\n\nYou need to take a break from your \"friends\" and have an honest conversation with yourself (and your husband) about what you're actually mad about, and figure out your next steps.", "ESH. I think you should be focusing your blame on your husband, Will, first and foremost. Laying the entire fault on Elinor is unreasonable \u2014 she didn\u2019t know that he was married, let alone married to you at the time of their affair. He\u2019s the one who\u2019s bound legally and morally to you, so he is the one who\u2019s really wronged you with his affair. \n\nYour friends, Spencer and Elinor, aren\u2019t completely innocent either because they withheld important, potentially life changing  information from you \u2014 someone who thought they were friends. But that kind of betrayal isn\u2019t anywhere close to what your husband has done to you, apparently repeatedly. \n\nI would consider marriage counseling if you would really like to salvage your relationship with your husband. I have sympathy for you to finding out about these various levels of betrayal, but I think you\u2019re also an AH for knowingly staying in this situation \u2014 it seems like you knew Will has a propensity for cheating.", "NTA. I cannot fathom the rage I would feel if my partner allowed me to become close friends with someone they cheated on me with, allowed our children to become close to their children, without disclosing this to me. I would lose my shit. I'm struggling with Spenser's role as well. After his new girlfriend told him she had sex with his best friend's partner, he doesn't tell his his best friend?!?!? Elinor seems the most reasonable out of the 3- of them. \n\nSpenser and Will are supreme AHs. Elinor was in a tough spot, and is not equally at fault. At some point as your relationship deepened, she should have told you, but when? She's almost certainly been getting pressure and coaching from the 2- AHs not to discuss this with you.", "NTA - No contact with affair partners is the basic requirement for reconciliation, chuck her ass to the road and don\u2019t allow her around again.  This is basically another betrayal by your husband.\n\n\nYou and your husband should both read a book called Not Just friends, I also suggest joining r/AsOneAfterInfidelity as the people there are far more knowledgeable and understanding of how to reconcile properly after an affair.", "NTA. How anyone expects you to host these people in your home is beyond belief. Your husband should be very grateful he's still got a wife.", "Honestly I see Elinor at fault for not saying anything. Who becomes friends with a man they had an affair with (yes she did not know in the beginning but she found out eventually) without ever telling the wife who was hurt in the affair. OP I understand if you feel like everyone around you has been lying for years. You created a friendship without the full picture and had no idea Elinor and your husband already knew each other so intimately. \n\nYour husband is equally at fault here. It sounds like you don\u2019t trust him and that\u2019s no way to spend your life constantly paranoid.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He admitted to it after she told him that she was pregnant though it ended in a miscarriage. Until recently I had no idea who she was as he wouldn\u2019t say who she was. I\u2019ve been working with Spencer (41M) for nearly 17 years, and we are best friends. There are no secrets between us, or at least that\u2019s what I thought. He\u2019s married to Elinor (33F), they have been together for 9 years, married for 8.  \n\nIt has recently come out that Elinor is the woman Will slept with. It came out because I had wrongly thought that Will was cheating again and he countered with that it was possible for him for him to be friends with women and not sleep with them, as he was friends with Elinor and hadn\u2019t slept with her again. He then admitted that Elinor had been the one that he slept with. I was hurt that he hadn\u2019t said anything before we had become good friends with her and allowing Spencer to get involved with a woman who was happy to sleep with married men.\n\nWhen I saw Spencer at lunch the following week, I told him about Elinor and Will.

Elinor hadn\u2019t said anything for the same reason.  \n\nI sent Elinor an angry text telling her that I knew about her cheating with my husband and that I didn\u2019t want her coming around anymore. I told her that I didn\u2019t trust her and that she should have told me that she slept with my husband.

He has said that if Elinor is not welcome then they will not be coming and thinks I am being unreasonable. He also said he knows I\u2019m upset but hopes that I can move past it. Will is upset that I\u2019ve uninvited them, as he thinks it will ruin Christmas for our kids not getting to see their friends as planned, plus we have far too much food in for a family of 4. Will thinks I am overreacting as I was fine with Elinor before I found out.\n\nAITA for not wanting to have Elinor at our Christmas?

How TF is that *her* fault? He then lied to you by not telling you that she was the AP. Again, that is on *him*. Yes, I can understand why you wouldn't want her over after just finding out it was her but honestly, *this is on your husband*. Why did he let you form a relationship with his affair partner (who he also lied to). Your husband is not a good person.", "ESH. \n\nEspecially your husband and you. While Spencer and Elinor should\u2019ve been more honest they are not the one married to you. Your husband is an asshole for cheating and not telling you the truth. You are an asshole because you blaming Elinor for cheating, when the one in the relationship is your husband. And she did not know he was married when the affair happened, he hid that fact from her. This dissolve Elinor from any blame and guilt, except when not telling you. But even then is not her job, but your husband.", "Nta", "Ok I\u2019m probably gonna get downvoted but Nta.

Keep her, her family,  all of them far away forever.   Cancel all future plans immediately. Block them all, expect your cheater husband to do it too. Friendship over.  Treat her like the potential homewrecker she is.  Don't look back and don't feel bad about nothing.  A big con has been pulled on you, by atleast 3 adults.

Your husband hid who this woman was from you for 11 years, and allowed you to cultivate a friendship with her. That alone would have me questioning EVERYTHING. That\u2019s a huge violation of trust on his part, and the fact this woman insinuated herself into your life and neither she, nor your husband, ever even planned on telling you she was the affair partner is despicable. \n\nYou have every right to cut this woman, and her partner who also hid this information from you for 9 years, off, and I wouldn\u2019t blame you for it one bit. These people all lied to you remorselessly for years. They don\u2019t deserve your forgiveness, nor are you overreacting or ruining the holiday.

But your husband kind of **lied** for all these years by not saying she was his affair partner. I would feel betrayed and cheated all over again. You both need to go to counseling. He actively lied by omitting for **YEARS** and he sees no wrong. You were in the dark for so long, they knew, it's like they were joking in your face without you being none the wiser. Personally, this would be another fucking level of **disrespect** and I couldn't tolerate it.

If you fucked  his best friend and then brought him to spend Christmas would he be okay? I'm guessing not. He disrespects you over and over and over again. He belittles your emotions and **his** wrongdoings. He wants everything to be sunshine and rainbows, but it can't, he cheated before, he disrespected you for 9 years by not telling you who she was, he let her get close to you and be ingrained in your life and your kid's life not saying anything **KNOWING** it would hurt you and you wouldn't accept it. He wants it all and everyone to act like he didn't cheat. But he did. And he needed to accept the consequences like an adult and tell you everything.

And for what??? He's disloyal,disrespectful, sad excuse of a human. To allow you to develop love, respect and loyalty for a woman he cheated with, just no.

You need to either get your affairs in order and divorce him, or decide to forgive him. But I would suggest seriously considering the former.

Really overwhelming your husband is a man of profoundly low character. That he we subject you to the humiliation of playing happy families with the woman he had an affair with for 9 years is an unfathomable betrayal that is equal to, if not worse, than his affair in my opinion. \n\nYou\u2019re TA because you are trying to scapegoat the AP for your husband\u2019s betrayal because you are not willing to face a deeper truth about your husband and your marriage. There is no \u201cequally responsible\u201d here. Only your husband made a vow to you. That he broke and then broke again everyday for 9 years until he threw it in your face to win an argument. Think about the fact that he chose to tell you, after all this time, to win an argument. Clearly part of him relished keeping this from you. Clearly part of him enjoyed throwing it in your face. He got one over on you yet again. And now he has the gall to say you need to suck it up and have Christmas with him. Why are you married to him? \n\nElinor and Spencer are distractions. My god she was 22 years old and apparently didn\u2019t even know he was married. He was a decade older than her and knew exactly what he was doing. Elinor and Spencer understandably made the decision not to blow up your marriage and probably didn\u2019t know what to do so they did nothing. Probably not the right move, but they were in an impossible situation and it sounds like they were going to take it to the grave.  They weren\u2019t trying to hurt you. Unlike your husband who decided to throw it in your face to savor one more humiliation at his hands. \n\nI\u2019m very sorry this has happened to you. And I realize the above sounds pretty cold, but you need to look at this situation with clear eyes and stop trying to blame everyone except your husband. You need to see him for what he is.

Did he think you knew??\n\nNormally, I would say Elinor is NTA except that she formed a friendship with you both without putting things out in the open, that is so messed up!! People saying she doesn't owe you anything like YEAH she didn't know about the marriage initially but she sure does now and she really didn't need to intertwine her life with Will's/yours. That's pretty messed up, too. If she was so into Spencer it would've been worth saying this out loud and letting you make your own decision 9 years ago. After this much time and interaction she's not some helpless woman caught up in all of this. If she was still a stranger to y'all my interpretation would be totally different.\n\nYour husband...I mean 1) you think he's cheating again so he sounds untrustworthy OR you haven't learned to trust him again for whatever reason, 2) he cites his ongoing friendship with his AP (who he got pregnant when she was 22 and he was 33) as evidence he can be friends with women, and 3) he tells you who is AP was like flippantly/accidentally. I would not be able to trust anything he says ever again. \n\nWhat a mess, OP. You need to put more blame on Will and Spencer, tbh, for keeping this from you all these years.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA. But your husband sure is. He should have told you exactly who it was, and certainly shouldn\u2019t have allowed you to form a strong friendship with the woman he cheated on you with. That\u2019s beyond fucked up. Almost psychotic.\n\nBut you also need to go easy on Elinor. If she didn\u2019t know he was married then she is not at fault whatsoever.\n\nETA: that\u2019s not to say I think you should invite her.

You deserve better, whether you believe it or not.", "She actually didn't wrong you back then. She didn't know he was married. In a lot of ways it's still only your husband that wronged you. He should have owned up to his actions and told you when your friend started dating Elinor.", "Why? Why forgive him for doing that? Leave. He's shown you again that he's not trustworthy and he's allowed a friendship to form between you and the woman he cheated on you with, and has kept her in his life, for a reason. he clearly has not moved on from Elinor.", "Because she had the chance to work it through with with for years. And is just now finding out what Elinor did, and she could've work this through with her also, but the three of them robbed her of the opportunity. I would kick out the husband too, If it was me, but I can see how all the hurt is focused on her best friend who didn't say anything.", "Exactly my thoughts. OP is out of line insisting her friend Elinor spill the tea. The person she should be holding accountable is TA she sleeps with.", "She lied by omission. She is not the biggest asshole, but she is still an asshole.", "And OP\u2019s husband spent the last 9 years pretending he didn\u2019t fuck Elinor\u2026", "Husband spent the last 9 years pretending he didn\u2019t fuck Elinor as well, and OP is fine with that. That\u2019s the hypocrisy", "So? Husband wasn't forthcoming with that information for the same 9 years either, and he's the one in the actual relationship.", "You got that wrong. You mean OP\u2019s husband spent those years pretending. If she wants to be mad at anyone, it should be her husband. Tbh, she should have ended the relationship when he hid who he cheated with.", "Sure but who cares about her. In this situation I'd rather focus on my partner betaying me", "It wasn\u2019t Elinor\u2019s place to tell OP. It was her husband\u2019s responsibility. Elinor didn\u2019t know OP when she slept with her husband and she didn\u2019t know he was married. By the time Elinor met OP, the affair had been dealt with and her and her husband had moved on. Why should she be the one to disrupt that when she didn\u2019t do anything wrong?", "Yes, but Elinor was told by Spencer (the person who knew OP so well) that she shouldn\u2019t tell OP. \n\nElinor may also have thought Will told her who she was and that OP was accepting of it (not necessarily ok with it, but also understanding that it was a long time ago and Elinor did not know Will was married and would never knowingly done that to anyone).", "But Elinor didn\u2019t know Will was married. Hence, she doesn\u2019t need to be forgiven as she did nothing wrong.", "Still doesn't make sense to forgive the one who was in the marrige and not forgive the one who had no clue that they were an affaire?!?", "So the only person you are willing to forgive is the one who actually cheated. He cheated and she did not even know that he was married. Your husband being a cheater is nobody's fault but his. Even if it is easier for you to put the blame elsewhere. \n\nETA: YTA (but obviously, Will is the biggest asshole even though he is off the hook for some reasons)", "Yeah gentle ESH. Your anger in Eleanor is misplaced somewhat, she certainly isn\u2019t \u201cequally at fault\u201d as your husband as she was single and didn\u2019t know Will was married to you. She also seems understanding that you\u2019re angry with her, she comes off sort of okay here tbh, all things considered. She\u2019s guilty of omitting the details of the affair from you and so is Spencer, and I can understand you being angry at her for that, but not the affair itself as frankly she was the secondary victim of that situation after you.\n\nI have nothing positive to say about your husband. If I\u2019ve got it straight he 1)cheated 2) omitted details of the affair partner 3) continue to build a (albeit platonic) relationship with this woman for a decade 4) have the audacity to be upset with you for being understandably angry about the situation which is frankly, fucked. \n\nYour anger is justified but it should be almost exclusively directed towards your husband. I think you need to decide on wether or not to work through this again, or consider other options.", ">How is she the asshole for feeling betrayed that her husband and his affair partner and friend kept this secret from her? \n\nShe's the asshole for being mad at the wrong person. ALL of this is on her husband, it is his responsibility to tell her yet she takes all her anger out on everyone but him", "Here is the thing. She is not angry at her husband, the one who cheated. She insists on blaming everyone BUT him.", "Because Will lied to Elinor and said he was single. She actually was single and thought she was just dating him. She didn\u2019t know OP and then go after her man, yet OP is mad as if that\u2019s how this all happened.\n\nOP keeps saying Elinor \u201ccheated with my husband.\u201d That\u2019s ass backwards. Her husband is the cheater. Elinor is the woman with whom he cheated, yet OP can\u2019t bring herself to even name it properly.\n\nThe husband was the original AH here because he\u2019s the one who broke his vows and deceived at least one woman, likely two. He\u2019s again the AH for \u201cbefriending\u201d this woman and bringing her into their home without disclosing who she is.  Elinor and Spencer are lesser AHs for even allowing this to unfold but I place 80% of the blame squarely on the husband\u2019s shoulders.", "But obviously, Mr Nice guy, her great husband who is 100% off the hook even though he is the only cheater in the story, couldn't have tell her that. Why is he still included in the Holiday dinner - or any event whatsoever really?", "Yes. But at the time the person who was married in question was Will and her. She has the right to know, but not to be mad to someone that didn't even know that slept with someone married. I see no sense in being mad with Eliot (sorry if spelled wrong) now, but Will who SHOULD have said who was the person years ago and probably go to couples therapy work on the marriage as she \"forgive\" him.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Maybe we have different perceptions of what friends should be - okay. She\u2019s probably angrier at Elinor because Elinor was the one who slept with Will and covered it up.
