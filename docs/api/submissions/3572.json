Think strategically about the timing of setting boundaries.", "NTA - When one side of a question is so bad that other family members literally leave the country to avoid her when she comes--that really says something.  It sounds like she's been really stomping on things so far.  You're not refusing to visit with her at all, just giving your parents, with their limited time to visit, the priority during that window and MIL gets time before and after.  Sounds like her time is pretty much her own--that's a fair compromise.", "NTA\n\nSoooo, you say family members plan trips to avoid your MIL?  Wow....to be so intolerable that folk spend money too escape!\n\nDo whatever needs to be done so your parents have a pleasant visit.", "You said in a comment that MIL stays at her own mother's house, not yours. So why is there a need to announce that you won't see her at all while your parents are visiting?

Maybe do one dinner with everyone to appease. \nI\u2019m hesitant to go this route because he\u2019s tried it before and someone always breaks down and just gives in to her (she\u2019s very persistent). Also want to avoid her popping in. That\u2019s not happened before, but if we are successful in stonewalling her for the first couple weeks she might get desperate.", "MIL doesn\u2019t stay with us. She stays with her mother.", "This is a good point. I want to tell her ASAP, but it\u2019s probably better to wait until a couple days before my parents arrive.", "Yeah, I feel like she doesn\u2019t realize (or doesn\u2019t care) that she can visit literally any time she wants. My parents only have this time. We\u2019ll see her before and after they\u2019re here, but we\u2019re not interested in making her part of all our plans. MIL likes to invite herself along to things, and would definitely ask my parents knowing they would feel awkward saying no.", "Haha, I know right?

Maybe not intentionally, but MIL is very self-centered.\n\nThe only \u201calone\u201d time my parents have had with their only grandchild was under sad circumstances (a family member died, so we went over) and MIL tried to elbow her way in to that visit. MIL was out in June for 4+ weeks and we spent more time than we normally would with her then so our kid could get to know her. MIL also has several other grandkids and a could great-grandkids. She hardly saw them.\n\nNow my parents are coming and she\u2019s got to come out too? Oh, and change her flight so her trip is longer than their\u2019s and completely overlaps it? It feels deliberate at worst, and inconsiderate at best.", "She\u2019s not above bad-mouthing us to her friends (family wouldn\u2019t listen to her). If we don\u2019t see her, she\u2019ll bug his sister more. SIL is very sensitive and MIL\u2019s shenanigans really get to her, so he\u2019s looking out for his sister there. \nI also think he\u2019s worried that she\u2019ll start popping in if we play hardball.", "Ugh you are probably right then. Especially if he is known for giving in. But he should tell her, not you. \u201cMother, while wife\u2019s family is in town we aren\u2019t going to be available.

Do you not want her to not even be in the same country while your family visits?", "You weren't an ah until this comment. You said she's coming here for another family member's engagement party. She didn't just plan this because your parents will be there. Why is everyone keeping her in the loop on what YOUR parents are planning? And it's fine if YOU don't want to see her during that time, whatever, but you're dictating that your husband can't see her either? She's not staying with you, why do you think you need to tell her everything that's going on? Do you seriously think you might not want one evening this entire trip where you spend a few hours alone with your parents, and maybe your husband and kid have dinner with MIL? YTA if you make a big deal out of it and try to say what your husband can and can't do while your parents are in town. He's a big boy, if he wants to give in and see his mom, that's his deal.", "...why do you care if she bad mouths you to her friends?", "She has a bad habit of inviting herself to events, outings, etc. My main concern is that she\u2019ll ask my parents if she can come along everywhere knowing they\u2019ll feel too awkward to say no. It would be fine if she\u2019d have a good time, but she\u2019s not into the stuff my parents like and always finds something to complain about even when she\u2019s chosen the activity.", "Husband doesn\u2019t want to see her either.

He only sees her to keep the peace, but never initiates plans with her.\n\nThe engagement party is Jan 10 She arrives on the 6 and was originally leaving on 6 Feb. my parents are here 24 Jan-10 Feb. Then MIL extended her trip to leave after Valentines Day. How else are we supposed to interpret that (husband agrees here)?\n\nWe didn\u2019t give her their exact travel dates. She just keeps asking every phone call if/when they\u2019ll be out. One of us (honestly can\u2019t remember who) gave her a vague arrival date. Then she probably just guessed the length of their stay based on other convos with us or maybe my SIL?", "We don\u2019t, other than the headache of hearing from some of her busybody friends. She\u2019s also friended random members of my family, and I\u2019d definitely be asked to explain.

Then be ready to say no.", "NTA - MIL sounds like a nightmare", "Even if you do tell her you don\u2019t want to see her she will still ask your parents to go with them"]}
