Body shaming is not acceptable and he participated in it by not dating her b/c of what his friends would think and say. Good job for calling him out for it.", "NTA, I don't know that I'd use the word cowardly but his actions are AH. Sounds like he's more in love with Jeff and Chris than either of you anyway.", "NTA. Clearly you lost some respect for him when you learned that and it's completely fair that you called it out.

She needs you and better friends! Fuck Alex, Jeff, & Chris! I am trying to understand why your best friends are calling you ah on this situation?! Reconsider your friendship with them.\n\nAs for Alex, why he is still friends with them if they gonna make fun of him for dating a \"fat girl\"?  If I were you, I'd break up with your boyfriend since he thinks his friends' judgemental opinions are more important than anything. Like, he barely speaks up for himself to protect his interests, and you're ok with that? \n\nI personally wouldn't date a guy like your boyfriend because he is scared of people's opinions about whatever he likes or loves. It's really sad because he should have known that his personal likes/preferences are not people's (especially Chris's and Jeff's) businesses. I'd be concerned about his trust, what if you guys argue or whatever happens in your relationship or life, then he runs to his friends to talk shit about you?", "Those are my thoughts too. I have guy friends too but, even though we tease and give each other shit, no one is outright cruel to each other or tries to pressure each other.", "I agree. It's the caliber of a friend, not the standard of men. I'm a bit overweight and my husband is more fit. When we got together all his/our friends had nothing but kind and encouraging things to say about it. What is ideal for one is not ideal for another. Keep on being a better caliber, sir!", "It\u2019s entirely possible this was something that took place in their teens. It\u2019s a common time to be less independent than approaching 30 and would make sense. I hope he would t be so thin skinned now as to take OPs comment to heart, but I also don\u2019t think we know enough to judge", "I think it applies. He was attracted to her and would have dated her, but for what his friends said.", "What makes Carrie not decent?", "This was about 5 years ago, so he was early 20s. And I believe him when he says he liked her, because there was no real reason to lie about it.", ">But, bearing that in mind, it's really none of your business what he did or didn't do and why, especially since it was before your time together.\n\nI mean, if he still has the mentality of \"I won't do something if it will make my friends mock me,\" then yeah, that could influence their current relationship. Hell, maybe it already has. Now that Alex revealed he's the kind of person who will let others influence his behavior, OP has to take a moment to consider how that will affect them. If they moved in together, will Alex refusr to do housework bc his friends would make fun of him if they knew? If they had kids together, would Alex fial back his affection for them bc his friends would make fun of him for that?\n\nEdit: Also, just bc his actions then may not have any bearing on OP's relationship now doesn't mean OP isn't allowed to tell her bf what she felt about this reveal, especially when he's the one who asked. You even admitted yourself it was cowardly, so how is OP an AH for telling him how she felt about that situation, which is what their discussion was about?\n\n>I also think it's just as likely that he's just using his friends as scapegoats here. It'd be much less surprised to find that it's just easier to say \"my friends would have mocked me\" than telling you that he was personally too shallow to ever date a fat girl. \n\nIsn't that worse though?", "As far as I know, he has never had a bad attitude toward weight. I've never heard him say anything cruel or judgmental about overweight people, which is why I'm so surprised and disappointed to hear that he'd let his friends talk like that around him.", "And what's going to happen if you gain weight? Is he going to leave you because of what those assholes might say? I would be reconsidering the relationship hard right now.", "I'm not trying to say he didn't like her, just that it may not have been the thought of his friend's making fun of him that kept him from acting on it. He could have certainly still been into her AND not made a move because he thought she was fat.\n\nAnd again, early 20's a person's brain isn't even fully developed. Maybe the real reason IS that he didn't want to deal with his friend's hounding him (I still find it weird, though, if they were all already friends why would they bust his balls about dating someone in their own friend group) but it doesn't change the fact that it was before your time, a personal decision, and none of your business.\n\nIt's not your place to belittle him, regardless of if it was cowardly or not, just because he DIDNT ask out a girl in his early 20s.", "As for that last bit - it is worse. I think her bf is an AH, whether what he said was true or if my idea was true. \n\nAnd for the first bit - the OP doesn't make ANY mention of her boyfriend treating HER poorly. She also doesn't make ANY mention of his friend's opinions causing issues in their relationship, so we have to assume that their relationship is fine. \n\nWith that in mind, it's ridiculous to then cause a whole big issue out of a dumb decision he made in his early 20s that has, literally, no bearing on his current gf or relationship. \n\n\"Now that Alex revealed he's the kind of person who will let others influence his behavior, OP has to take a moment to consider how that will affect them.\"'\n\nHe WAS the kind of person that let his FRIENDS influence him exactly ONE verifiable time, FIVE years ago.  People grow. Everyone has made dumb choices. You've certainly made dumb choices YEARS AGO in your past that you wouldn't want a current or future SO to belittle you over.", ">the OP doesn't make ANY mention of her boyfriend treating HER poorly. She also doesn't make ANY mention of his friend's opinions causing issues in their relationship, so we have to assume that their relationship is fine. \n\nWell what if she doesn't know? He doesn't have to treat her poorly for it to be a sign that he's still letting his friends influence him. What if he's the type of guy who would normally give his gf flowers and choclatw and things like that but doesn't bc of his friends? What if he's the type of guy who would plan cheesy romantic dates but doesn't bc of his friends?\n\nAnd as soon as you know someone not do something just bc of fear of mocking, the self-doubt atarts creeping in. What other aspects of his life are affected by this? Does he let their opinions decide what style of clothes he buys? If they ever made fun of his relationship with OP, how would he react? Would he start bashing her to them? Start distancing himself from her? \n\n>With that in mind, it's ridiculous to then cause a whole big issue out of a dumb decision he made in his early 20s that has, literally, no bearing on his current gf or relationship. \n\nOP didn't cause an issue. She got reasonably upset upon learning something negative about her boyfriend. It's not like she started yelling and screaming, or going on a tirade or anything like that. She got quiet as she processed what she just learned and then expressed her feelings to him when he asked her to. \n\nIt sounds more like he caused a big issue. His attitude about it is also really suspicious, and doesn't bode well about it just being a past issue. It's a display of emotional maturity to be able to look at your past actions and acknowledge that they were wrong. And I say this as someone who also used to be like Alex: when I was younger, I would let my mom influence my behavior more than I should have. But if I were to tell someone an example and they called me out on it, I would like to think I have the grace and growth to say \"yeah, it was cowardly. I *should* have been more infependent. I'm glad I'm not like that now, but what happened happened and all I can do is learn from it and move on.\" Getting defensive is not an indication of groqth and emotional maturity.", "Getting defensive is often a clear indication that the person knows they were in the wrong - even if they don't have the growth or maturity to be able to talk about it. \n\nYou're comment here is chock full of 'what ifs' and that's the problem. WHAT IF it happens again? WHAT IF this? WHAT IF that? \n\nWell, WHAT IF he learned his lesson, feels bad about it but isn't in the position to have 'gotten over it', so to speak. Yes, he asked her, but SHE responded to the issue like it's something fresh an called him a coward. Not that he was acting like one, 5 years ago, but that HE IS a coward. Right now. For something in his past that NOW he can't change. \n\nSo, in your own example, you'd be totally fine with someone you care about saying that they're upset with you NOW because you ARE (not WERE) a coward and that you're that you're just an unkind, follower because you USED to let your mom influence you more than you should have?", ">Getting defensive is often a clear indication that the person knows they were in the wrong - even if they don't have the growth or maturity to be able to talk about it. \n\nBut it doesn't matter if you know you're in the wrong if you're not willing/able to admit it and work on bettering yourself. If a narcissistic parent gets defensive when called out on their behavior by their children but don't apologize for their actions, acknowledge their wrongdoings, and make an effort to stop that behavior, they're still kind of awful. They can get defensive all they want-it doesn't mean they've changed. \n\n>Well, WHAT IF he learned his lesson, feels bad about it but isn't in the position to have 'gotten over it', so to speak.\n\nThen OP probably has to decide if she's willing to be with a partner who hasn't reached that emotional maturity yet. Most ppl want a partner who is capable of learning and geowing from their past-it's a good indicator of what they'll do in a relationship. You wouldn't want to be with someone who still can't get over their behavior from five years ago, would you? Do you have faith that someone like that could handle issues in your relationship of they can't in their friendships/personal life?\n\n>So, in your own example, you'd be totally fine with someone you care about saying that they're upset with you NOW because you ARE (not WERE) a coward and that you're that you're just an unkind, follower because you USED to let your mom influence you more than you should have?\n\nIt depends. If they were just agreeing with me that it was wrong, I'd be fine with it, bc they'd be right. If they decided to believe that I hadn't learned from it despite saying I had, then that's on them-I can't control what other ppl think and I'm not going to go out of my way to prove myself to soemone else when it's more important that *I* know I've changed. It'd be annoying, for sure, but at that point I would have done what I could to let them know I was aware I was wrong in the past but have moved on. \n\nBut it also depends on how I tell ppl about it. If I were to give an example of a time I let soemone else influence me, I would also add that I acknowledge it was wrong of me at the time and that I don't do that anymore. But Alex didn't do that. Alex didn't say \"I regret letting my friends influence my behavior,\" he didn't say \"I learned from it and have stopped letting my friends' words bother me.\" He didn't say anything to indicate he was upset with himself about his behavior."]}
