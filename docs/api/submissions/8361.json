There\u2019s a reason certain areas are off limits to non-employees.", "NTA, it's literally the simplest thing in the world. It's an employees only area and she is a customer. There is no amount of regularity that transforms a customer into an employee.\n\nShe sounds incredibly entitled to the point of delusion and like she's breaking a lot of rules and possibly laws.

I work in a charity bookshop and the number one rule is that no one sets foot in the back room unless they work there. It's an absolute golden rule and is because of the security of staff possessions and also the donations themselves.  Some may be valuable and haven't yet be sorted.  If this lady is as rude as you say then I think you're fine to absolutely stonewall her on this one.  Don't leave her any room for interpretation. Just 'No' is fine.", "NTA. If she cannot follow very simple rules then she should be warned of additional consequences. \"You can explain to the police why you think it's ok for __you__ to trespass\"", "NTA.

She's entitled, you're NTA.\n\nOr she can just get a job there and be an employee.", "NTA\n\nNext time she threatens to call corporate, give her their phone number.

She reeks of entitlement and also quite frankly, she sounds lonely and possibly driven away others once close to her due to her entitlement attitude.", "NTA. She was trespassing and you would be in the right to call the cops on her and have her removed.  You / your employer would also berl well in the right to ban her from the store altogether.", "Definitely NTA. I'd threaten to call the police.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nNow with a new manager, this is the perfect time to set up and start regulating your business policies. Having non-employees in employee areas opens up the business for insurance liabilities as well as the suspected losses you're aware of. By having hard and fast rules in place protects you and your business from any \"call to corporate\" this person may have.", "NTA. Call corporate yourself - or better yet have the manager do it - and ask them to deal with her.", "NTA. I could imagine if she tripped on something back there and decided to sue for it, your management would step up. I'd put up one of those \"Caution! Wet Floor!\" signs near the entrance to the back room. You're employees there, and should have a place to put your personal items that won't be breached by customers.", "NTA\n\nShe isn't an employee", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext time, call a manager, or directly the police to trespass her.", "NTA - Doesn't this reporting thing go both ways.   A customer wants to be treated a particular way but doesn't \"corporate\" have to protect you guys from this kind of stuff?", "NTA you said items are going missing? they need to protect y\u2019all", "NTA this reminds me of when I worked at Goodwill in Florida.  THIS is exactly why I only lasted 2 months until I found a better opportunity. Good luck OP", "NTA Ban her!! Corporate and HR even your manager has to put their foot down and not allow this! Tresspassing is illegal", "NTA. I can\u2019t even imagine what other reasons previous managers let them into the backroom for in the first place.", "NTA. And if she really thinks complaining to corporate about the fact that you won\u2019t let a customer (or an ex \u201cemployee\u201d/manager)come in the back, which is employees only, will work, she would be crazy LMAO", "NTA, time to get a lock on the door", "I am thinking that  the only reason that  she's gotten away with this  for  so long is that  when she does actually  shop WITHOUT  trying to get items marked down  further  is she does spend more than other customers.", "NTA\n\nBut your management needs to back up their employees and warn corporate about her. She's harassing employees and invading your much needed break space.", "NTA. V needs professional help. Which she will not find in the back room.", "Call the police and have her trespassed. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nPeople like V don't magically change or get better; their sense of entitlement is too strong. The only way you're going to be rid of her as a problem is to have her legally trespassed and banned from the property. The business can survive without her.", "Yep.  You were well within your rights to call the police on her for trespassing.\n\nNTA", "Honestly, I'm wondering why they haven't trespassed her and banned her from the store. Even if she spends hundreds of dollars a week it can't be worth the hassle.", "NTA. V needs to be banned from the store. Let her call corporate. Dial the number for her and explain the situation, then hand her the phone.", "Why hasn't her butt been banned all ready?!", "NTA. her entitlement is out the yang. Just because she's shopped there for years doesn't mean a thing. She's a customer, that's it. She has no right to demand or go as she pleases. After the first reminder I would've called the police on her for trespass and attempted theft. She's like the woman that pulled a fire alarm during black friday so everyone would have to leave the store so she could get the items she wanted. If management isn't going to do anything about her and won't let you stand your ground defending the company, then it's probably better to find somewhere else to work.", ">People have had personal items go missing after V has been in the store in the past.\n\nWhy hasn't she been banned? NTA.", "NTA.\n\nPlease shoot down entitlement at any and all opportunities.", "NTA. Your store needs real doors, and your manager needs to police the \"employee only\" area better when she's in the store.", "Like when I worked for a while as a door greeter. Learning the ropes, I would be told whose faces to remember because they're thieves and to watch them closely. I never understood why do they let them keep coming back in knowing their history and low and behold they get caught trying to steal again every time they came back. It makes no sense.", "NTA. You should have called the cops for trespass.", "I could never work retail.  Your amazing.  I'd have told her she had to leave the back area or the police would be called to remove her.  Maybe suggest to the manager to get a locking door.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Managment needs to step and ban her from the store. If she can't follow rules than she doesn't need to be there.", "NTA\nEmployees should be entitled to a space where they don't have to worry about customers stealing from them.", "NTA. I\u2019d have called security, and if they were not around the police, after the 2nd warning.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019m sorry to have to do this but this area is for employees only. I\u2019m going to have to ask you to please return to the customer area.\u201d\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, again, this area is for employees only.
