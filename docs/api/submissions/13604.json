{"id": 13604, "submission_id": "1276mrt", "title": "AITA for not reinviting my sister and her family to my wedding after we changed it?", "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9 and I planned to have a large wedding in July at a venue in the country. I guess that was too out of the way for most people because only 14 people rsvp-ed that they were coming. We had already set aside money for our wedding and since there was no longer going to be a lot of people coming we decided to splurge. \n\nSo, we asked everyone who rsvp-ed that they were coming if they could take a few extra days off for a longer trip to Hawaii all expenses paid by us. Everyone said yes, so we started booking tickets and suites at this nice resort. We also planned some fun things to do while we're there. Everyone is very excited for the trip.\n\nNow my sister, who rsvp-ed that she and her family weren't coming, is upset that I didn't reinvite her when we changed plans. She thinks that since it's basically a different trip they should have been told. Originally she said she couldn't come to our wedding because that time of the year is very difficult for her and her husband because the summer is the busiest time for their business. They have a landscaping business. Also she said traveling that far with all her kids would be difficult because of the long car ride. It would have been around a 3 hour drive from where she lives. So it doesn't make any sense to me for her to say she can go on a longer trip even farther away. The plane trip is almost 9 hours long. Also she says it's unfair because our brother and his family gets to go while hers doesn't. That's making her kids feel left out because their cousins are going and my sister says it's like playing favorites.\n\nMy sister and her family would be five more people so even if we wanted to reinvite them they would cause us to go way over budget. The only other option would be to drastically downgrade the trip we already promised everyone. it just seems totally unfair to everyone else, but my sister also thinks I'm being unfair and says we pulled a \"reverse bait and switch\".", "created_utc": 1680228157, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1276mrt/aita_for_not_reinviting_my_sister_and_her_family/", "score": 588, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hawaii is, apparently. \n\nShe just wants the free trip. **NTA.**", "NTA- just reinvite her, but explain you're going back to the original plan because you can't afford it with all the people that can now come.  I betcha she changes her story again.", "NTA, if a 3 hour drive trip during her busy season is too much for her then a longer trip to Hawaii certainly should be a well.   She RSVPed as No and doesn't get to change that because the destination is suddenly more interesting for her. \n\nShe doesn't want to support you at your wedding,  she just wants a paid beach vacation.", "NTA. Your sister is basically saying that she didn\u2019t prioritize your wedding when it was in the original location, because it wasn\u2019t fun enough for her, but now wants to go on a fun, free, holiday.  And yes, fair enough, we all want a free holiday, but she showed you her priorities clearly.", "NTA. You can reinvite her sure. But she has to pay for herself.", "NTA. She doesn't care about your wedding. She couldn't even make the effort to come to your original wedding. She's just upset she's missing out on a free vacation to Hawaii. Do not feel bad and do not re-invite her. Enjoy your beautiful day!", "NTA. Your sister wasn't interested in going to the original wedding, but now that the event is something she actually wants to do, somehow all those excuses she made don't apply any more. It's obvious she just wants a free trip to Hawaii, I don't think she cares about your wedding at all", "You acknowledged those who responded they could come. Now your sister sees a trip on your dime, not hers. Don\u2019t punish the others by downsizing your plans to fit her and all she wants. If she wants to pay her way and get tickets etc then fine. NTA.  Still all her reasons for not saying she would go to with the initial invite, all those reasons didn\u2019t disappear. I just think she wasn\u2019t keen on going until Hawaii and free was in the picture. Maybe if all adults going on this trip, say it\u2019s all adults only. I doubt she wants to pay a sitter. But still the trip needs to be on her dime and effort. Caught it. Kids will be there. Still. You stick to your plans. Sorry sister, you made it clear it\u2019s the busiest time of the year and 3 hours is too long to travel w your kids, as this trip will be even longer.", "NTA.\n\nShe wants Hawaii, not your wedding.", "Let me rephrase this for you.\nI organize a wedding few hours away by car drive. For this reason only few people RSVP. Ok.\nSo I decided to reward myself and my bone fide friends with an even more logistically challenging wedding. The destination wedding! and foot the bill. But now that the wedding is basically a paid vacation, suddenly it\u2019s not anymore inconvenient for super busy \u2018I can\u2019t drive more then 30 minutes I am super busy\u2019 sister.\nYeah NTA \nI m sure if she doesn\u2019t want to miss it she can book her own room where you are.", "I would tell her you didn't think she would want to be reinvited to a longer trip that's further away than the original 3 hour drive since it's still the busy season for her business and that kids who have difficulty on a 3 hour drive would have 3 times as much difficulty on a 9 hour plane ride.\n\nYou are NTA, but your sister is TAH for trying to get a free Hawaiian vacation from you when she couldn't be bothered to attend your wedding.", "This fires me up! If she was my sister I will tell her right to her mooching face:\n\nYour greed for a free Hawaiian vacation for you and your family is gross. This is a celebration for our wedding. If you didn\u2019t want to drive 3 hours for it, it\u2019s obviously not an event that is that important to you - location doesn\u2019t change that. Tell your kids that your disinterest in family screwed them out of a trip, not me.\n\nGreedy people piss me off.\n\nSo, so, so much NTA\n\nEDIT - or if I was feeling more charitable and snarky: you an you family are welcome to coordinate a family vacation to Hawaii with us while we\u2019re there for my wedding, since you really seem interested.

She just wants a free trip. If you we\u2019re important to her she would have made the time to come to the original planned wedding.", "NTA\n\nThis is a wedding, not an online game loot box to lure in whales.

She's clearly a selfish person who has no interest in being there for you. Don't let her taint a special day. You've got a lovely trip booked with people you know care about you, just enjoy that and appreciate the good people in your life", "NTA. Her reasons (or excuses) for not attending apply even more to the new trip, so she is obviously unable to attend, and you do not need to re-invite her. It was very rude of her to decline the invitation, then insist on it when she realized it would be a much cooler, all expenses paid trip, and by doing so, she basically admitted she lied to you and did not want to attend your wedding in the first place.", "Nta", "Nta. Oh so she didn\u2019t have time for the wedding in the original location but they have the time to go to Hawaii? lol", "NTA You changing it to Hawaii changed none of her \\*original\\* reasons for not being able to attend your wedding changed. They're still going to be in the busiest part of their season. It's an even LONGER trip than before. The only difference is the location and she's not having to pay for it. She didn't care enough to attend your wedding when it was inconvenient for her. Don't let her guilt you in to this.", "NTA. She wants an all-expense paid trip to hawaii. She\u2019s TA and selfish for not going to your original wedding plan but wanting a free trip. \nMaybe re-invite them, but make them pay for their own flights and hotel. Yeah, you\u2019ll have to pay a little extra for food/drinks at the reception, but that wouldn\u2019t be as expensive as paying for their suite and flights too. I\u2019m guessing suddenly she won\u2019t want to come\u2026 since it isn\u2019t a free vacation. But that would be a compromise.", "Wow! That\u2019s baller!! Good for you and def NTA. Don\u2019t fall for the guilt trip, if she wants to go so bad then your parents can pay for it.", "NTA", "NAH/NTA\n\nFrom your explanation of your sisters RSVP it makes total sense why you felt it was pointless to invite her again and why you assumed she couldn\u2019t go. You\u2019re NTA for not inviting her.\n\nI see two possibilities here. Either way you didn\u2019t do anything wrong and aren\u2019t TA, but the way I\u2019d approach each situation differs.\n\n1) It is possible she may just be sad she wasn\u2019t invited to the new wedding - even if she knows she cant go. Some people just like to know they are wanted/welcome and want invites to everything regardless of their actual intention to attend. Is she like that? Do you think she actually plans to attend? If this describes her, she\u2019s being kinda petty but overall her being upset would be understandable and I\u2019d say she\u2019s NTA either so NAH overall. In this scenario I don\u2019t think sending an invite is a toss up. You\u2019re not obligated to send her one by any means, but it would be a nice thing to do.\n\n2) Or your sister may not have cared about going to your wedding enough to outweigh the \u201cinconvenience\u201d attending would bring her when your wedding was in the country. But now that it\u2019s somewhere exotic like Hawaii (and all expenses paid) she wants in. That would make her a jerk who cares more about getting a free trip to Hawaii than being there for you on your wedding day. If you feel that this is the case - she\u2019s TA and I wouldn\u2019t feel any obligation to invite her. If it was me-  I would also probably tell her to go kick rocks.\n\nCongrats on your wedding!", "INFO: is it still at the same time of year?", "You did pull a reverse bait and switch. Something smells funny to me in your post - almost..like you wanted to punish those folks who RSVP'd no?\n\nYou change the dates and venue and don't even tell your own sister?\n\nWeird af.

She was unwilling to go to any bother for your original wedding but all of a sudden now that you are going to Hawaii she feels entitled to an all expense vacay on your dime!\n\nNOPE!!! NTA.....she is!", "NTA You found out who really cared enough to come to your wedding, and it wasn\u2019t her.  Now she\u2019s playing the victim.  Boofuckinghoo.", "NTA", "NTA, she lied about the real reason for not being able to attend, and that lie has backfired on her. She doesn't have the time to go for a 3 hour drive and maybe go back home the next day, but when she heard you changed your wedding plans, she magically has the time for an even longer trip. Now you know where her priorities are, hers and anyone else who might be b**hurt about not being reinvited (not including her kids and maybe her husband).", "NTA - you can certainly re-invite her, but let her know that you budgeted based on her original rsvp. She can come, she just has to pay for it herself.", "Nope, she found out about the free trip and now she\u2019s pissed she and all her kids aren\u2019t getting bankrolled. NTA.", "No it called \"you snooze you lose\". Since a few people chose to go the budget was enough to upgrade (for them). Now that the trip is bigger and funny now they want to celebrate with you? Sorry... If trips are hard with kids bigger trips are even harder. Not your fault that they didn't want to make the extra effort for your wedding (but willing to do so for the free tropical vacations) NTA", "Lol, there is an A H in this story and it isn\u2019t you. It\u2019s that person that now wants a free trip to Hawaii. NTA. Enjoy your wedding!", "NTA but your sister sure is. She already RSVP'd so why would you call her again. I agree with everyone else, she just wanted a free trip to Hawaii. Well, she should have been a better sister and showed some appreciation for the original plan. I hope you have the most FABULOUS wedding!!!! \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA.\n\nPlease re-invite her!!!! She deserves it!!\n\nBut tell her that since she RSVP\u2019d \u201cno\u201d, all plans and the budget have already been finalized say\u2026 the day before she asked :). She\u2019s welcome to join you guys, but had to pay her own way.", "NTA your sister is greedy", "NTA.  She wants the free trip.  The ones who originally said yes, those are your people!", "I can't see anything wrong with what you've done. NTA", "A reverse bait and switch is just... straightforward honesty.\n\nHave a fun trip!\n\nNTA", "NTA,\n\nOf course you shouldn't re-invite anyone who didn't RSVP yes to the original invitation.  All the reasons your sister gave for not going to your wedding as you originally planned it still apply to this plan\n\nThough I really must applaud and commend you and your fianc\u00e9 for the way you handled what must have been huge disappointment when you only received 14 positive RSVP's for your original wedding destination when you had planned a large wedding - I'm thinking a minimum 100.  You had a setback, and you went straight ahead and came up with a brilliant new plan", "NTA. Clearly if a couple of days away from work and a 3 hour drive are an inconvenience, then five days and a 9 hour flight (plus all the hassle of going through the airport) would be even more of an inconvenience. Her arguments hold no water, and you shouldn't indulge her.", "NTA the trip is different (not in any fundamentally meaningful way for people who couldn't make it: it's the same time except longer and more travel so even more restrictions regarding schedules) because people like your sister didn't want to show in the first place. If your sister is indicative of the rest of your family's attitude, I understand why so few people RSVP'd: they're selfish, self-centered, and you deserve better. \n\nCongrats and have a great trip!", "Darlin, have a wonderful wedding in HI and tell your selfish sister what everyone in the above thread has said. Enjoy!", "NTA she just wants a free trip and is using the \"not fair on my kids\" line as an excuse.\n\nWhen we were organising our wedding we picked a Friday in June and a venue that didn't have accommodation, I was worried that it would put off people who needed to travel. My Gran gave me some very wise words, \"if people really want to be there to celebrate your marriage, they will find a way to make it work\"\n\nI get your sisters business is busy in the summer but you gave them notice and it's not too far to travel. She chose her business as a priority and she explained it to you, all of which is fine as it is her choice. If she really feels her kids are missing out then she can pay for the trip herself to see you get married.", "NTA \n\nTell her that she will have to pay for half her trip, then charge her double, and you will only accept the money at least 1 month in advance. LOL\n\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious what she is about. Don\u2019t be a sucker. Congrats on your wedding.", "NTA. She wants a free vacation for her and her family, she doesn\u2019t care about your wedding. Don\u2019t bulge", "NTA. Sorry, Sis. If she wants to pay her way, you'd be willing to let her join you, but there is just no budget available for her family, since she declined the invitation.", "NTA\n\nYou already have the guests attending that care for you. Everybody else can stay at home like planned.", "NTA. You saw who really cared and who didn\u2019t and you\u2019re taking care of the ones who gave a damn.", "Agreed. NTA.  If they have suddenly found time IS available at this time of year, they should join you--at thier expense.\n\nCongratulations!", "Happy cake day! This is exactly the right answer. Declining 3 hours of drive for 9 hours on the plane.\nAND SHE'S THE SISTER. I'd cross the other side of the world for my sister's wedding.\n\nNTA.", "Oh this idea is the BEST. I\u2019d love to be a fly on the wall for that conversation!", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 omg this, please", "Sadly, the sister will never tell her family the truth about it, but you would hope that they find out eventually that Mom said no to her sister, and that is why they didn't get to go see their aunt get married.", "THATS what she should be teaching her kids. Rather than using them as pawns to manipulate and being willing to actually let them believe they were excluded maliciously.", "LOL selfish sister alert \ud83d\udea8", "This is such backwards thinking. \n\nYou can assume malice all you want, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s anywhere close to reality.\n\n OP said they wanted to do something nice for who was present. It is quite self centered to make that about people who aren\u2019t present and aren\u2019t receiving the benefit of being present. \n\nNo one is responsible for someone else\u2019s hurt feelings. Only accountable to their behavior. OP\u2019a behavior was reasonable, and with respect for the adult decisions her adult invitees made. And clearly, the sister is behaving with manipulation, willing to use her kids as pawns to incite guilt, and is doing so with no self awareness for how toxic the behavior she\u2019s displaying is. That shouldn\u2019t be enabled.\n\nIf anyone is doing a reverse bait and switch, it\u2019s the sister.", "Look a little further back.\n\nSister previously caused the problem she's having **now** when she decided that OP's wedding wasn't worth prioritizing.", "[removed]", "i'd make sure to password protect the reservations so the sis doesn't try to ruin it all and go behind her back and try to cancel everything.", "NTA she just wants a free vacation.", "Tell her that of course she and her family are welcome to come, it's not in the budget to pay for people who aren't originally coming to the wedding.", "All of this!! Turn it back on her, where it should be!", "[removed]", " Your sister and her family are welcome to join you of course,", "why even offer meals? she rsvpd NO", "> him at his word when he said\n\nAren\u2019t we talking about a sister?", "Someone planning a wedding is already doing an incredible amount of consideration of other people, balancing with their own self. \n\nShe didn\u2019t disinvite nor forget to invite her sister to her wedding. SHE invited her and her entire branch - who declined. \n\nOP LITERALLY EVOLVED THE PLANS SHE HAD WITH CONSIDERATION FOR THE RSVP\u2019s she could count on. There is nothing unreasonable about that. There is nothing inconsiderate or rude or malicious about that. Only someone with similar skewed thinking/behavior would assign those qualities to those steps in planning ones wedding. \n\nNo one should allow themself to be treated that way (manipulation on top of being a low priority) and then be encouraged to accept and enable it \u201cbecause family\u201d. That\u2019s unhealthy. Reciprocity of effort Is respect. For yourself when another person doesn\u2019t prioritize you, and for another person if they do prioritize you.", "A good sibling would have checked, simple as. And as far as this situation is concerned the sister is definitely the bigger asshole, which I conveyed above.\n\nI'm all the way with your last paragraph. How her sister acted and what she demanded was some BS. I only think the OP was an AH in not checking beforehand. In all other aspects her sister is the one that's tripping.\n\nI really do think OP's (and anybody's) behavior should be judged on their own terms. It's cliche but two wrongs don't make a right. OP shoulda check in with sis, that's all."]}
