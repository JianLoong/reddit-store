I guess that was too out of the way for most people because only 14 people rsvp-ed that they were coming. We had already set aside money for our wedding and since there was no longer going to be a lot of people coming we decided to splurge.\n\nSo, we asked everyone who rsvp-ed that they were coming if they could take a few extra days off for a longer trip to Hawaii all expenses paid by us. Everyone said yes, so we started booking tickets and suites at this nice resort. We also planned some fun things to do while we're there. Everyone is very excited for the trip.\n\nNow my sister, who rsvp-ed that she and her family weren't coming, is upset that I didn't reinvite her when we changed plans. She thinks that since it's basically a different trip they should have been told. Originally she said she couldn't come to our wedding because that time of the year is very difficult for her and her husband because the summer is the busiest time for their business. They have a landscaping business. Also she said traveling that far with all her kids would be difficult because of the long car ride. It would have been around a 3 hour drive from where she lives. So it doesn't make any sense to me for her to say she can go on a longer trip even farther away. The plane trip is almost 9 hours long. Also she says it's unfair because our brother and his family gets to go while hers doesn't. That's making her kids feel left out because their cousins are going and my sister says it's like playing favorites.\n\nMy sister and her family would be five more people so even if we wanted to reinvite them they would cause us to go way over budget. The only other option would be to drastically downgrade the trip we already promised everyone. it just seems totally unfair to everyone else, but my sister also thinks I'm being unfair and says we pulled a \"reverse bait and switch\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit.

Hawaii is, apparently. \n\nShe just wants the free trip. **NTA.**", "NTA- just reinvite her, but explain you're going back to the original plan because you can't afford it with all the people that can now come.  I betcha she changes her story again.", "NTA, if a 3 hour drive trip during her busy season is too much for her then a longer trip to Hawaii certainly should be a well.   She RSVPed as No and doesn't get to change that because the destination is suddenly more interesting for her. \n\nShe doesn't want to support you at your wedding,  she just wants a paid beach vacation.", "NTA. Your sister is basically saying that she didn\u2019t prioritize your wedding when it was in the original location, because it wasn\u2019t fun enough for her, but now wants to go on a fun, free, holiday.  And yes, fair enough, we all want a free holiday, but she showed you her priorities clearly.", "NTA. You can reinvite her sure. But she has to pay for herself.", "NTA. She doesn't care about your wedding. She couldn't even make the effort to come to your original wedding. She's just upset she's missing out on a free vacation to Hawaii. Do not feel bad and do not re-invite her. Enjoy your beautiful day!", "NTA. Your sister wasn't interested in going to the original wedding, but now that the event is something she actually wants to do, somehow all those excuses she made don't apply any more. It's obvious she just wants a free trip to Hawaii, I don't think she cares about your wedding at all", "You acknowledged those who responded they could come. Now your sister sees a trip on your dime, not hers. Don\u2019t punish the others by downsizing your plans to fit her and all she wants. If she wants to pay her way and get tickets etc then fine. NTA.  Still all her reasons for not saying she would go to with the initial invite, all those reasons didn\u2019t disappear. I just think she wasn\u2019t keen on going until Hawaii and free was in the picture. Maybe if all adults going on this trip, say it\u2019s all adults only. I doubt she wants to pay a sitter. But still the trip needs to be on her dime and effort. Caught it. Kids will be there. Still. You stick to your plans. Sorry sister, you made it clear it\u2019s the busiest time of the year and 3 hours is too long to travel w your kids, as this trip will be even longer.", "NTA.\n\nShe wants Hawaii, not your wedding.", "Let me rephrase this for you.\nI organize a wedding few hours away by car drive. For this reason only few people RSVP. Ok.\nSo I decided to reward myself and my bone fide friends with an even more logistically challenging wedding. The destination wedding! and foot the bill.

If she was my sister I will tell her right to her mooching face:\n\nYour greed for a free Hawaiian vacation for you and your family is gross. This is a celebration for our wedding. If you didn\u2019t want to drive 3 hours for it, it\u2019s obviously not an event that is that important to you - location doesn\u2019t change that. Tell your kids that your disinterest in family screwed them out of a trip, not me.\n\nGreedy people piss me off.\n\nSo, so, so much NTA\n\nEDIT - or if I was feeling more charitable and snarky: you an you family are welcome to coordinate a family vacation to Hawaii with us while we\u2019re there for my wedding, since you really seem interested.

You've got a lovely trip booked with people you know care about you, just enjoy that and appreciate the good people in your life", "NTA. Her reasons (or excuses) for not attending apply even more to the new trip, so she is obviously unable to attend, and you do not need to re-invite her.

Oh so she didn\u2019t have time for the wedding in the original location but they have the time to go to Hawaii? lol", "NTA You changing it to Hawaii changed none of her \\*original\\* reasons for not being able to attend your wedding changed. They're still going to be in the busiest part of their season. It's an even LONGER trip than before. The only difference is the location and she's not having to pay for it. She didn't care enough to attend your wedding when it was inconvenient for her. Don't let her guilt you in to this.", "NTA. She wants an all-expense paid trip to hawaii. She\u2019s TA and selfish for not going to your original wedding plan but wanting a free trip. \nMaybe re-invite them, but make them pay for their own flights and hotel. Yeah, you\u2019ll have to pay a little extra for food/drinks at the reception, but that wouldn\u2019t be as expensive as paying for their suite and flights too. I\u2019m guessing suddenly she won\u2019t want to come\u2026 since it isn\u2019t a free vacation. But that would be a compromise.", "Wow! That\u2019s baller!! Good for you and def NTA. Don\u2019t fall for the guilt trip, if she wants to go so bad then your parents can pay for it.", "NTA", "NAH/NTA\n\nFrom your explanation of your sisters RSVP it makes total sense why you felt it was pointless to invite her again and why you assumed she couldn\u2019t go. You\u2019re NTA for not inviting her.\n\nI see two possibilities here. Either way you didn\u2019t do anything wrong and aren\u2019t TA, but the way I\u2019d approach each situation differs.\n\n1) It is possible she may just be sad she wasn\u2019t invited to the new wedding - even if she knows she cant go. Some people just like to know they are wanted/welcome and want invites to everything regardless of their actual intention to attend. Is she like that? Do you think she actually plans to attend? If this describes her, she\u2019s being kinda petty but overall her being upset would be understandable and I\u2019d say she\u2019s NTA either so NAH overall. In this scenario I don\u2019t think sending an invite is a toss up. You\u2019re not obligated to send her one by any means, but it would be a nice thing to do.\n\n2) Or your sister may not have cared about going to your wedding enough to outweigh the \u201cinconvenience\u201d attending would bring her when your wedding was in the country. But now that it\u2019s somewhere exotic like Hawaii (and all expenses paid) she wants in. That would make her a jerk who cares more about getting a free trip to Hawaii than being there for you on your wedding day. If you feel that this is the case - she\u2019s TA and I wouldn\u2019t feel any obligation to invite her. If it was me-  I would also probably tell her to go kick rocks.\n\nCongrats on your wedding!", "INFO: is it still at the same time of year?", "You did pull a reverse bait and switch. Something smells funny to me in your post - almost..like you wanted to punish those folks who RSVP'd no?\n\nYou change the dates and venue and don't even tell your own sister?\n\nWeird af.

I would not call those the ride-or-die people in their lives, but the people with more flexible schedules.  A weekday wedding 3 hours away is either a very tiring, long day off of work or two days off of work.  It would have made more sense to make it a medium-sized wedding on a weekend when immediate family could attend without taking 2 days off, or a weekday wedding closer.  \nNow, the sister's \"too busy\" and \"kids hate travel\" reasons are still bullshit since she was okay with Hawaii over the same dates, and if I were her I would offer to pay and not be whiny about it.  She's being an AH as clearly she lied/exaggerated instead of saying she was annoyed it was a weekday 3-hour away wedding and wasn't attending out of protest.  But I can see how if you have limited vacation, you would scrap a different intended family vacation in favor of attending a destination wedding.  The same person might not take two days off to attend a wedding that seems set up to make it difficult for guests.  \n\nPersonally, I'm going to my sister-in-law's wedding on a Friday night but not helping with or attending anything rehearsal on Thurs. because they live 6 hours away and it was their choice to have it a fancier place on a Friday night to \"save money\" when they could have gone with somewhere cheaper on a Saturday.  Then we would have come up  Friday and been more a part of things before the wedding.  But when it's all about the \"perfect venue,\" sometimes you lose commitment from people because you communicate that they're not the priority.

It's not a race where the person who calls the insurance company first gets the money. Your father named a beneficiary when he took out the policy, and the insurance company will only issue the benefit to the named beneficiary. If the primary beneficiary is no longer alive, it goes to the secondary beneficiary, and if the secondary beneficiary is no longer alive, it goes to his estate and gets distributed according to his will or to a probate court decision.\n\nIf your mother is not named as his beneficiary, it doesn't matter that she's the one who asked the insurance company to process it, she's not going to get the money no matter what she does. I'm thinking she's hoping that he didn't get around to taking her off the policy and naming a new beneficiary after their divorce. If that's the case, it still wouldn't matter whether she's the one to get it processed or you are, legally, she would have a right to the money, and there would be nothing you could do about that.

Just something as simple as they can't actually get the time, no PTO and can't afford the day.", "What she said is that they had to change the wedding to midweek because at the reduced guest count they couldn't do a weekend wedding at their venue", "She can try, but insurance companies have been around the block, they've seen shenanigans like this and many others your evil mother hasn't even thought of, and planned for them in the process of filing and processing the claim . My great-uncle who had no children of his own made me the beneficiary of his life insurance, and to claim the benefit I had to take a certified copy of the death certificate, a government issued photo ID and my social security card, the original insurance policy, and the completed claim forms down to a notary public to be notarized, then send the death certificate, original policy, notarized claim forms, and copies of the ID and SSN card to the insurance company. And getting the death certificate was a whole other rigamarole because I was not immediate family and was out of state, could only get the copy because I was listed as the beneficiary and had to do some decent paperwork to get that.\n\nThen, the insurance company gave me two choices of payout, lump sum or annuity. If I chose a lump sum, they would only direct deposit it into an account that I was a primary account holder on. If I chose an annuity, an investment account would be set up in my name.\n\nOh, and even though I previously said if your father forgot to take your mother off the policy the money would go to her, I fact checked that, and depending on whether the insurance policy is a federal one or not and the state your father lived in, your mother may have automatically lost her designation as a beneficiary when she and your father divorced. Insurance companies do vital records checks before paying out benefits, and your parents' divorce would pop up. That would also be a backstop against her trying to claim the benefit as you, her name and last known address would come up in that result. When you file a life insurance claim, the insurance company sends you paperwork and notices by mail, so they need a current address. Obviously she wouldn't put her address on claim forms, because then you'd receive all those notices, and the jig would be up. But if she puts her address to receive the notices, chances are her name will come up as a resident there which would red flag the claim. Insurance companies have whole armies full of people whose sole job is scrutinize life insurance claims looking for any possible way they might be able to get out of paying out...and also to catch fraud.\n\nSo the point is, I believe you that your mother is villainous enough to try to get your father's insurance money, even with the high risk of being caught and going to jail for identity theft and insurance fraud, I highly doubt she would successfully jump all the hurdles without getting caught. That's not to say it wouldn't be a good idea to inform the insurance company in writing that your mother and father were divorced, and that she is trying to claim the benefit, possibly by acting in your name, and that you do not authorize her to do so, and they should only discuss the claim with you through your address and phone number.\n\nAnd the other point is, while the potential payout of insurance fraud is high enough to entice someone like your mother to try, the potential payoff OP's sister would get for cancelling hotel reservations (no way she'd be able to cancel airline tickets) would be so small, and the risk of alienating the entire family by doing so would be so great, she'd have to be an especially vindictive and especially stupid person to bother.
