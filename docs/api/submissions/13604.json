{"id": 13604, "submission_id": "1276mrt", "title": "AITA for not reinviting my sister and her family to my wedding after we changed it?", "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9 and I planned to have a large wedding in July at a venue in the country. I guess that was too out of the way for most people because only 14 people rsvp-ed that they were coming. We had already set aside money for our wedding and since there was no longer going to be a lot of people coming we decided to splurge. \n\nSo, we asked everyone who rsvp-ed that they were coming if they could take a few extra days off for a longer trip to Hawaii all expenses paid by us. Everyone said yes, so we started booking tickets and suites at this nice resort. We also planned some fun things to do while we're there. Everyone is very excited for the trip.\n\nNow my sister, who rsvp-ed that she and her family weren't coming, is upset that I didn't reinvite her when we changed plans. She thinks that since it's basically a different trip they should have been told. Originally she said she couldn't come to our wedding because that time of the year is very difficult for her and her husband because the summer is the busiest time for their business. They have a landscaping business. Also she said traveling that far with all her kids would be difficult because of the long car ride. It would have been around a 3 hour drive from where she lives. So it doesn't make any sense to me for her to say she can go on a longer trip even farther away. The plane trip is almost 9 hours long. Also she says it's unfair because our brother and his family gets to go while hers doesn't. That's making her kids feel left out because their cousins are going and my sister says it's like playing favorites.\n\nMy sister and her family would be five more people so even if we wanted to reinvite them they would cause us to go way over budget. The only other option would be to drastically downgrade the trip we already promised everyone. it just seems totally unfair to everyone else, but my sister also thinks I'm being unfair and says we pulled a \"reverse bait and switch\".", "created_utc": 1680228157, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1276mrt/aita_for_not_reinviting_my_sister_and_her_family/", "score": 3658, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hawaii is, apparently. \n\nShe just wants the free trip. **NTA.**", "NTA- just reinvite her, but explain you're going back to the original plan because you can't afford it with all the people that can now come.  I betcha she changes her story again.", "NTA, if a 3 hour drive trip during her busy season is too much for her then a longer trip to Hawaii certainly should be a well.   She RSVPed as No and doesn't get to change that because the destination is suddenly more interesting for her. \n\nShe doesn't want to support you at your wedding,  she just wants a paid beach vacation.", "NTA. Your sister is basically saying that she didn\u2019t prioritize your wedding when it was in the original location, because it wasn\u2019t fun enough for her, but now wants to go on a fun, free, holiday.  And yes, fair enough, we all want a free holiday, but she showed you her priorities clearly.", "NTA. You can reinvite her sure. But she has to pay for herself.", "NTA. She doesn't care about your wedding. She couldn't even make the effort to come to your original wedding. She's just upset she's missing out on a free vacation to Hawaii. Do not feel bad and do not re-invite her. Enjoy your beautiful day!", "NTA. Your sister wasn't interested in going to the original wedding, but now that the event is something she actually wants to do, somehow all those excuses she made don't apply any more. It's obvious she just wants a free trip to Hawaii, I don't think she cares about your wedding at all", "You acknowledged those who responded they could come. Now your sister sees a trip on your dime, not hers. Don\u2019t punish the others by downsizing your plans to fit her and all she wants. If she wants to pay her way and get tickets etc then fine. NTA.  Still all her reasons for not saying she would go to with the initial invite, all those reasons didn\u2019t disappear. I just think she wasn\u2019t keen on going until Hawaii and free was in the picture. Maybe if all adults going on this trip, say it\u2019s all adults only. I doubt she wants to pay a sitter. But still the trip needs to be on her dime and effort. Caught it. Kids will be there. Still. You stick to your plans. Sorry sister, you made it clear it\u2019s the busiest time of the year and 3 hours is too long to travel w your kids, as this trip will be even longer.", "NTA.\n\nShe wants Hawaii, not your wedding.", "Let me rephrase this for you.\nI organize a wedding few hours away by car drive. For this reason only few people RSVP. Ok.\nSo I decided to reward myself and my bone fide friends with an even more logistically challenging wedding. The destination wedding! and foot the bill.

If she was my sister I will tell her right to her mooching face:\n\nYour greed for a free Hawaiian vacation for you and your family is gross. This is a celebration for our wedding. If you didn\u2019t want to drive 3 hours for it, it\u2019s obviously not an event that is that important to you - location doesn\u2019t change that. Tell your kids that your disinterest in family screwed them out of a trip, not me.\n\nGreedy people piss me off.\n\nSo, so, so much NTA\n\nEDIT - or if I was feeling more charitable and snarky: you an you family are welcome to coordinate a family vacation to Hawaii with us while we\u2019re there for my wedding, since you really seem interested.

You've got a lovely trip booked with people you know care about you, just enjoy that and appreciate the good people in your life", "NTA. Her reasons (or excuses) for not attending apply even more to the new trip, so she is obviously unable to attend, and you do not need to re-invite her.

Oh so she didn\u2019t have time for the wedding in the original location but they have the time to go to Hawaii? lol", "NTA You changing it to Hawaii changed none of her \\*original\\* reasons for not being able to attend your wedding changed. They're still going to be in the busiest part of their season. It's an even LONGER trip than before. The only difference is the location and she's not having to pay for it. She didn't care enough to attend your wedding when it was inconvenient for her. Don't let her guilt you in to this.", "NTA. She wants an all-expense paid trip to hawaii. She\u2019s TA and selfish for not going to your original wedding plan but wanting a free trip. \nMaybe re-invite them, but make them pay for their own flights and hotel. Yeah, you\u2019ll have to pay a little extra for food/drinks at the reception, but that wouldn\u2019t be as expensive as paying for their suite and flights too. I\u2019m guessing suddenly she won\u2019t want to come\u2026 since it isn\u2019t a free vacation. But that would be a compromise.", "Wow! That\u2019s baller!! Good for you and def NTA. Don\u2019t fall for the guilt trip, if she wants to go so bad then your parents can pay for it.", "NTA", "NAH/NTA\n\nFrom your explanation of your sisters RSVP it makes total sense why you felt it was pointless to invite her again and why you assumed she couldn\u2019t go. You\u2019re NTA for not inviting her.\n\nI see two possibilities here. Either way you didn\u2019t do anything wrong and aren\u2019t TA, but the way I\u2019d approach each situation differs.\n\n1) It is possible she may just be sad she wasn\u2019t invited to the new wedding - even if she knows she cant go. Some people just like to know they are wanted/welcome and want invites to everything regardless of their actual intention to attend. Is she like that? Do you think she actually plans to attend? If this describes her, she\u2019s being kinda petty but overall her being upset would be understandable and I\u2019d say she\u2019s NTA either so NAH overall. In this scenario I don\u2019t think sending an invite is a toss up. You\u2019re not obligated to send her one by any means, but it would be a nice thing to do.\n\n2) Or your sister may not have cared about going to your wedding enough to outweigh the \u201cinconvenience\u201d attending would bring her when your wedding was in the country. But now that it\u2019s somewhere exotic like Hawaii (and all expenses paid) she wants in. That would make her a jerk who cares more about getting a free trip to Hawaii than being there for you on your wedding day. If you feel that this is the case - she\u2019s TA and I wouldn\u2019t feel any obligation to invite her. If it was me-  I would also probably tell her to go kick rocks.\n\nCongrats on your wedding!", "INFO: is it still at the same time of year?", "You did pull a reverse bait and switch. Something smells funny to me in your post - almost..like you wanted to punish those folks who RSVP'd no?\n\nYou change the dates and venue and don't even tell your own sister?\n\nWeird af.

If by some cosmic alignment she actually does decide to go, let her show up at the empty venue.", "I just wanted to say I'm so sorry your sister has done this to you.  Enjoy your wedding!", "Info: What do you mean you could only get a weekday wedding?", "I think this is a really important point. You were already NTA, but the fact that she could suddenly find way more time at the same busy time of year makes her unwillingness to drive 3 hours in the first place so much worse.", "I would love to witness a shake down like this but the tension triggers my cackle. I have to step away fast.", "Just don\u2019t tell the sister or she\u2019ll ask you to buy one for her and her family as well.", "You know I\u2019d normally take this comment as just being paranoid. But with my dad having just died, he left me no paper trails, I\u2019ve been sorting every piece of mail trying to find something. I finally found his life insurance policy. I call to make a claim just to find out my mom (his ex wife) had been calling multiple times a day for days trying to get them to process it.", "Good luck planning a wedding / location that works perfect for all the family is nearly impossible", "The wedding was planned for the summer, which is when the largest portion of the population is avaliable. Is the bride and groom really supposed to consider everyone elses jobs when they plan? That's why they send invites early and you usually have months to plan for time off. \n\nHow far up your own anus is your head if you believe the OP is an asshole for not considering a sister who only wants to attend a free family vacation but not a free family wedding? You want her to consider a sister who didn't didn't want to come to the wedding?", "No, it's AH move only if you get mad when people can't make it.", "Anyone who planned their wedding this way would have to have ten separate weddings at ten different locations to accommodate everyone. The sister has already made it clear that neither the time nor the location is actually a problem for her as she\u2019s willing to go even farther away at the same time of year for a \u201cbetter\u201d destination, so the point you think you\u2019re making is irrelevant.", "There is no way this sister goes on her own dime and is pleasant. But we know the sister will never pay for herself.", "Im pretty sure one brother, SIL, and kids RSVP'ed and a different sister and BIL declined", "Exactly. If the date changed dramatically, it would be different story as the timing could have been a legitimate reason. But the dates being the same, definitely makes OP NTA.", "Bruh are you for real that's nothing, for my brother's wedding I woke up at the crack of dawn after working a 72hr shift and then traversed my living room carpet and stepped on a lego and I didn't go to the wedding. He understood.", "Yeah, but did you do it with KIDS in the car?", "This is the worst. My dad recently died as well, and this stuff truly brings out the worst in people.", "You can win billions, but if the other party has doesn\u2019t have it, you don\u2019t get it.", "I work at a courthouse and I would absolutely splooge my pants if my judge had this case!", "There is a difference between \u201call the family\u201d and \u201cliterally the couple\u2019s siblings\u201d lol", "If the other party is a luxury wedding venue in Hawaii, if they say they don\u2019t have the billions you take their fucking hotel.", "I would specify flights and hotels/accommodations just to be super clear, and this is a great way to put it!", "It wouldn't be the hotel on the hook. It would be the sister. A court would throw it out unless you added protections and the hotel ignored it.", "I honestly think it\u2019s still not clear enough.  I would say something like \u201cUnfortunately our budget has already been reached for our wedding and sadly we cannot pay for the trip for any additional guests.\u201d\n\n\u201ccannot accommodate\u201d is just too vague for me"]}
