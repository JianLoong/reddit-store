Stepping down might make her think you don't really want to be in her wedding, not just the dancing. And remember, a lot of the bridal party was uncomfortable with the idea. I'm guessing they are all breathing a sigh of relief right now.", "I would (and do) feel the same. Baby sister made us dance a circle around her at her wedding and I hated it. So I put my hands up and clapped to the beat of the music like I was clapping for the people in front of me. Made me part of the vibe without feeling like a spectacle. \n\nSo do that: be the last one in and just be clapping.", "She should get it choreographed so you know what to do. Everyone \"dancing\" without any choreography is gonna look dumb.", "Depending on keen-ness of the wedding party, has she considered a crescendo of dancing. Send the least keen in as walkers, then have subsequent 'waves' of the bridal party be more and more dancey.  \nWalkers \nJivers\nDancers", "NTA. It's fine not to want to go along with this. You aren't an asshole or any less of a person for not being comfortable with it. For some people, this kind of exhibitionism is their bag, but for you it isn't.

Frankly, the trend is probably something she\u2019ll regret but if it\u2019s important to her then, well, it\u2019s her wedding day. She shouldn\u2019t have to scrap something she really wants, but you\u2019re not obligated at all to do something that makes you uncomfortable. So either take a step back or just walk while the groomsman dances. There might be a way he can incorporate you walking into his dance, or you could just walk beside him and watch and cheer him on like everyone else will be doing, except you\u2019ll be doing it from right beside him. That would make it less awkward, and she is your sister and this is her special day, so stepping out of your comfort zone for her just a little wouldn\u2019t hurt. But if you\u2019re just absolutely against that, that\u2019s fine, talk to her about you attending as a guest instead.", "INFO \n\nIs it like cherographed stuff or just like jumping around to music like the bridal party intros can be at the reception?", "NTA dancing wedding parties are an introvert nightmare.", "NTA. There is no way that I would do it, I understand how you feel. You aren't the entertainment, you are a real person.", "NTA. I went to a co-workers wedding. It was extravagant. Everyone danced down the aisle except one of her sisters. No one cared. She just clapped for her partner who was dancing down the aisle.", "My SIL wanted this at her wedding but one of her bridesmaids said no. She offered to step down. So SIL negotiated and had them enter the reception (after the ceremony, photos and a bunch of champagne) dancing. It was still a bit stressful for the bridesmaid but she was much happier with that and agreed. As another commenter suggested she just came in clapping with her hands above her head and a bouncy walk.", "I mean there is a simple solution, be drunk before you have to dance down the aisle! In my culture there is no walking the bride, she generally just walks slow and shy surrounded by the ladies of the house but I wanted to dance to my groom and I was hesitant if my bridal party would go with that! But, lo and behold they were choreographing the dance steps and my steps and it was brilliant! I was so happy and so glad they went with it. I know for a fact that I will always have those few moments that were just mine and even if it might have looked unclassy or whatever, it was mine!", "Not really an answer to your question but have you considered choreographing your isle dance and practicing regularly to minimize anxiety? I don\u2019t think anyone expects it to be good, but it could help you feel better. \n\nI do think stepping down at this point may come across as petty, and that she obviously wants you in the wedding party which is why she changed it. It does really stink that she had to modify her day, but anxiety is a real issue as well. So it\u2019s hard, but I would talk to her about it if her anger continues and see if she thinks she will ever move past it and if the answer is an honest no then offer the option of stepping down and see what her response is", "NTA The wedding party isn\u2019t a bunch of puppets.

Fine for her to run it up the flagpole; \u2018zilla-ish to get pissy when the idea flops.", "NTA, it sounds like a stupid idea anyway, you did get and everyone else at the wedding a favour!", "NTA I think this is a big ask - I wonder if you can just arrive early and sit up at the front and then join them as they get to the front? Like you don\u2019t need to back out of the entire wedding but it\u2019s ok to not want to dance down the isle or walk while everyone else dances.\n\nThe point of the dance is to make it fun\u2026an expression of excitement? but it\u2019s not fun \ud83d\ude02 it\u2019s just pretend if you do it.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to do it.

Lol.\n I'm the same as you I have to be very drunk to do anything more than squaddy two step.", "NTA, but you missed a nice chance of getting drunk. The wedding would have been much more hilarious \ud83d\ude02, and obviously your sister is going for the funny wipe with a dance down the aisle.", "NTA.  What about if you don't walk in pairs, and if you were the first or last to walk in before the bride, or were already at the front of the church?  I feel like there's a compromise here somewhere that would work just fine.  Have everyone walk/dance as they wish, not even necessarily in order, but just take their correct spot once they're up front?  Or perhaps have them dance out after the ceremony?  Have you accompany the parents in and sit with them until it's time for you to approach the front?  Have you accompany another non-dancer guest of honor?", "NTA\nDid she just discover the internet? This shitty \u201ctrend\u201d is at least ten years old, so pass\u00e9, and absolutely the worst.

You live every day and die once!", "What has happened in this world that so many people can't put themselves aside for just a bit  for someone else.. It's exhausting....it's a minute out of your life for someone you supposedly love. Good grief, just walk and raise your arms to the beat... YTA", "Honestly, the only way they joy and fun would be expressed like the vision in your sisters mind is if everyone was on board. I think she will be disappointed to force people who aren't into it. But there are other options than what you stated. People will be watching the entrances, you could go to the front from the side, or discuss with your sister all of the options so you can have it both ways. Think of the venue and how you can work it out. The best weddings are ones that are thoughtful and unique. You can walk down the aisle to a traditional song, and when you take your place, they can start the dance entrance. People will not care. You could walk down the aisle to \"All By Myself\" instrumental, which I think would be hilarious and playful without making you step out of your comfort zone and give your sis the fun vibe... and then they can start the dance entrance.", "YTA.  I get that anxiety isnt your fault, but if its something that could be cured with a drink, then its something you can get over and do for her.  You obviously mean alot to her if shes willing to scrap the idea to maintain your participation.", "I cannot second guess how bad your anxiety is.  Personally I would hope that you are getting medication and/or treatment for this.  I wonder if you live in a sheltered world where you are not challenged to deal with situations that can make you anxious, e.g. workplace, public places, etc.\n\nFrankly, this is a small ask IMHO.  You could have done many things to alleviate this anxiety.  I mentioned therapy, medication plus you can practice the dance (immersion therapy) .  Plus I am sure that there a multitude of other ways to help you deal with your anxiety.\n\nAgain I wonder if you are willing to make the effort to work on your anxiety for your sister who loves you enough to include you in for her special day.", "YTA.

So when they inevitably do, J&P don't care and just enjoy it. It was also very Jim and Pam to have a shared secret separating them from the nonsense around them.
