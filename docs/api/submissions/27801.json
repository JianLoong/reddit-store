The young adult with autism came back with out on so naturally I asked what was wrong and if she needed any help. All of a sudden she is yelling at me. After putting up with it for a minute I got too mad and decided to yell back at her telling her she had no right to yell at people. This was not the first time she had gone of on one at me or one of my friends. It was though the first time of me reacting to her. After u finished yelling she burst into tears and ran and told a tutor who decided to tell me off and not her. AITA.

You have omitted all context surrounding what was going on here.", "If she can have a meltdown so can you. She might have had other things going on to trigger it that you don't know about, but so did you. Everyone has a breaking point & loose their shit sometimes, everyone talks from a script, everyone stims, it's just magnified with auties. If she can meltdown in class without getting in trouble, everyone can. NTA", "INFO: what exactly did you say to her before she started yelling?", "INFO: there's nowhere near enough context here for someone to give an answer. But as an autistic person, i have a feeling there's something else going on here. \n\nmay i ask, is it a frequent occurrence that you offer this girl help? did she seem in distress or concerned at all? what, other than the lack of laptop, prompted you to ask if she needed help?\n\nfollow-up to that, what exactly was she yelling at you? why has she yelled at you in the past?", "NTA just because she has autism it doesn't give her the right to just shout at you for no reason. She's not incapable of understanding why that's wrong. Just sounds like she's good at manipulating others to make it that everyone else is the bad guy when she acts like an ass.", "Info: does she get treated differently (like an idiot or babied) because of her autism?", "INFO: All of a sudden she is yelling at me. \n\nDoes this happen to you a lot? People yell at you and you just don't know why?", "NAH. She has a medical condition and you weren't in a emotional state to deal with it, but I believe that someone who has experience to deal with people like her should be handling her in the future not you.", "Autism is not an excuse for bad behavior.  Neither are tragic events in your life, though I am sorry to hear it.  There was nothing wrong with your initial question and she had no business yelling at you.  While yelling back isn't the nicest thing to do, I can see why you did it and could have understood if you had gone off on the tutor as well.  NTA, but she is.", "NTA: you are in no obligation to accommodate for someone else\u2019s disability", "As an Autistic Adult NTA but it's not your job to help her even if she was struggling. \n\nAlso you aren't exactly a paragon of kindness and understanding in this thread which leaves me suspecting there's a lot more you're leaving out the way Allistics like to do when they're very aware it makes them look bad.", "She thinks that she was going to get told off by a tutor I think.", "YTA. you knew she was autistic and had seen this happen before. screaming back at her will not fix the problem, it just makes you a bully and a jerk. Go get security. Get an admin. Tell people to back off and give her a chance to get herself together.  anything but making things worse.  Some autistic people are like toddlers or children, you screaming back was childish on your part.  You did nothing but cause her more distress.  dont be surprised if her response to seeing you from now on is screaming - and eventually you will have to answer as to why", "NTA but also E S H.\n\nYou shouldn't have yelled back but at the same time she started it by yelling at you.  Even if you weren't emotional from the day before... many people would've yelled back if they were screamed at for what seems to be no reason.\n\nSounds like like the tutor lets her use her ASD as a bit of an excuse with some of her behaviours.\n\nDon't overthink this.  No one wants to be yelled at no matter what.  What happened would not be tolerated by many.  This classmate of yours may find that people don't want much to do with her.  She may not understand why but someone should be helping her understand - that doesn't have to be you.  No one wants to be abused.", "Let's just forget about the autism, let's pretend for ease that it's not a factor. It's still as likely that you would have got told off and not her if she was the one running to the tutor as it would have been her side heard first and you would have started on the back foot. We can't assume that she was let off because of her autism, it could just have been the way it was told to the tutor. You cannot control the behaviour of others but you can control your own. Let's say there was no real trigger for her outburst like you said (not sure I believe that but we'll go with it). Your port of call when she started yelling would have been to a) walk away b) try to reason but you chose c and yelled back. I understand that you were grieving and this is relevant. I'm not sure YTA but you made poor choices, most likely based on your grief. \n\nI dont think there is an AH in this situation. \n\nIf it happens again, walk away and explain to your tutor that she has been yelling, let them decide if this is mitigated by her condition or not.", "YTA. . . but not too much of one.\n\nDifficulty with emotion regulation is a core feature of autism. So, while yelling at you is not ok and you have every right to feel upset about it no matter who is doing it or why, unlike you, she did not have a linear process of feeling angry then deciding to yell at you. It was entirely likely not a choice at all, and it is even possible that she did not know she was yelling and her first alert that this was happening was you telling her she didn't have a right to yell at people.\n\nYou are not on the same playing field when it comes to your ability in real time to understand your emotions and use them to communicate with someone else, so more is expected of you, the person who \"decided\" to yell, rather than the person who, because of a disability, was (probably) not able to decide not to. That doesn't mean you have to take being yelled at; it just means that how you deal with it should be informed by the other person's capabilities and intent.\n\nThat said, it sounds like you were a bit at the end of your emotional rope and lost it more than you ordinarily would have, so I wouldn't beat yourself up about it too much; just maybe handle it differently next time. You can stay calm and still stand up for yourself or let her know you don't want to be yelled at without yelling yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is a conflict resolution issue though.  And you dont go running to security or admin or 'mommy and daddy' every time you get in an argument with someone. Sure she could have handled it better without yelling back, but this was a heat of the moment situation.
