I was left in my home state with no car no job & no money, I had reached out to my mother & my sister(24f) but my sister was closer & she was cool with me staying until I got back on my feet. I was employed within 2 weeks of moving in, fast forward 3 months, her boyfriend(25m) said they didn't mind if I stayed \"long term\" because I'm not a bad roommate (we agreed I would pay the electric bill to make it easier for them). I used this to my advantage to pay off my debt & raise my credit score because I want to get an apartment on my own & buy a car. Fast forward to Sept of 2023, I get a text saying they want me out, a few days go by, sisters BF loses his job, sisters hours are not dependable, we come to agreement that I would pay half the rent to pay my way through (making it harder to save but idc). \n\nHere we are all caught up. BF has a union job now, he's still in his first few weeks but it's a job he can bring home $1,000 weekly if he worked the hours, but he chooses to leave shifts early because \"it's too much work\". BF & I would share his car because of my situation, I would always fill up the tank & the only place I go is to work & the gym. Now that he has this job where he has the option to work 3 hours a day everyday, he leaves the keys in his bedroom & said he doesn't want me taking the car to work or to the gym because it's \"acting funny\". This morning I overheard my sister & her BF talking about - now that he's making this much money, he only has to pay the electric & they'll be able to leave here much sooner. She made it clear a long time ago they'll only be looking for a 1 bedroom. So, essentially, I'm busting my ass to pay half of her rent(at the expense of my savings) until they tell me they found somewhere to move to. While he hogs the car keys & plays computer games every hour of the day, I am losing my mind 10 miles away from the gym / skatepark with nothing to do every day but go to work. He has said \"you could get your own fucking car you know\" to which i responded \"maybe if i was in a position to save more money i would have had one.\" \n\nYes I am petty, no it is not my car. Anyways, if I just up and leave (i'm not on the lease) forcing BF to actually work & pay his way through life again, WIBTA? Sister claims they are \"struggling\" but he is in a position where if he busted his ass working, he would bring home rent & electric in 1 check, he chooses not to because \"half the rent is already paid it's not like i need to work 40 hours\" ...... i love my sister but i want to bodyslam this kid", "created_utc": 1696771206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/172yzbw/aita_for_moving_out_of_my_sisters_apartment_while/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
