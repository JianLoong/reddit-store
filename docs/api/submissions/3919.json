By this time my sister had told my mum that I knew about D so I specifically told my mum it's a girls night we're not bringing partners. She was super excited and was like yep definitely just girls. So we go to our first cocktail bar and we're having a good time singing kareoke and I notice this guy hanging out by my mum but walking away when I would come back to the table and one of my friends even mention like \"hey I think that guy is flirting with your mum' and we have  a laugh and carry on then we go to the next bar and 15mins later that same guy is there with my mum again so mum and I are in the bathroom together at one point and I'm like 'hey, is that D?' And she was like yeah I told him where we were. I was like mum it's a girls night!! We didn't argue or anything she just giggled and walked back out to him and I carried on kareoking with my friends and mum.

She asked why and I said well I know very little about him considering you're keeping him a secret from us this whole time and the only thing I do know about him is that he crashed our girls night.

Your mother has had time to arrange a meeting with her boyfriend, but has not.

Never mentioned he was dating after my mom died and then one day wanted to bring his serious gf to a party at my house. Nope. She may have been lovely (she wasn\u2019t) but I would be stressed enough hosting and cooking, and I didn\u2019t want to be trapped in my house if things went wrong. So instead he had her drop by while I was packing some of my dead mom\u2019s things he planned to throw away. Just a total lack of understanding about how it might make me feel and - more importantly - only focused on what he wanted such that he\u2019d shoehorn her into a situation where I\u2019d be nearby. \n\nAnyhow, boundaries, boundaries, boundaries. If she breaks one, set a more restrictive boundary until she learns. I haven\u2019t seen his gf in 4 years because when I did finally meet her, she said racist shit and I made her cry. More boundaries. I MAY see her over the holidays this year because, well, I\u2019m a sucker. But you can bet if things go awry, straight to boundaries.", "This is also problematic\n\n> She then said she wouldn't come to christmas cause he's not invited and I'm an asshole cause now she's missing out on Christmas with her kids and grandkids because I won't let him come too.\n\nShe's CHOOSING to not come because he's not invited, so she is the one causing herself to miss out, however, put together with other things, I wonder how much influence he has on her decision...", "If she's still a racist make her cry again please. Please \ud83d\ude4f", "The behavior at the girls night is super weird though. Like if he had just stopped by to meet op and drop her mom off/pick her up, that would be normal and a polite(ish) way to introduce himself. The walking away and avoiding op makes it seem like he knew he wasn't invited but insisted on not letting ops mom go out without him. Depends a lot on if he insisted or if ops mom asked him to come along and lurk creepily. Either way, he knew he wasn't welcome at girls night and should have declined if ops mom asked. This reasoning gives me the big red flag vibes too.", "If she was excited, she wouldn't have hidden the fact it was her boyfriend. \n\nI'm sure one evening without your partner by your side wouldn't kill you. She couldn't even manage that. But, did he turn up by himself or was it planned between mum and boyfriend to just both go anyway?", "That\u2019s how I took it. Moms probably just excited about a new relationship which inherently isn\u2019t bad or unusual. Honestly I think it\u2019s a little odd her adult children are completely unwilling to meet the guy\u2026 is one holiday meal with moms man gonna kill them?", "It\u2019s not even a question. I\u2019m not sorry and I\u2019ll do it again.", "Not even just an evening, but an evening you promised your DAUGHTER would just be a girls night. Seems priorities might be a little mixed up.", "Exactly. You hide a bf when you don\u2019t think it is going to last or it\u2019s a married man/boss something that needs keeping quiet relationship. \n\nNow it\u2019s a couple months so perhaps they have moved to the yes we really like each other and it may last phase so let\u2019s meet family.  But the meeting should not be during a holiday where there is gifts and you don\u2019t know what dynamic the new person will bring. I agree with OP. the meeting should be neutral.", "especially bc it\u2019s not like he\u2019s meeting his new gf\u2019s young kids- op and their siblings are grown adults!", "NTA - either your mother is attempting to emotionally blackmail you or this man is manipulating her (but why would he care so much about having a meal at your home?)\n\ndon't give in to this child like behavour.", "NTA and you aren\u2019t keeping her from spending Christmas with her kids and grandkids, she is. She is choosing a new man over her family.", "NTA.   2 months is nothing. I think you did the right thing\u2026..and as a middle aged American white woman who falls asleep to crime shows. A very smart thing\n\nOne last question though..  to anyone out there,  what is steam pudding?", "You\u2019re mom definitely should have asked and not assumed she could bring D. That makes her the AH to start. Seems like you could do better about communicating back. Focus on your I statements and not on what she did.", "NTA. There is a reason she was hiding her relationship with him from all of you and it\u2019s probably something bad.", "NTA If she cannot do you the courtesy of telling you about his existence and introducing you, then letting you get to know him, then she doesn't deserve an invitation for him into your home. Your sister's opinion doesn't matter here as she got to know him, you haven't.", "NTA buuuuut beware of major red flags for this dude. He\u2019s isolating your mom from you and it\u2019s working.", "It's true - your house your rules. But admit it, you're using Xmas as an excuse to punish your mother for not clearing her bf with you. An Xmas gathering is a perfect opportunity to introduce a new friend to the family.", "Yeah, the whole \"I told him where I was going for a girl's only night and he came here and followed me to the next place\" screams control issues! Unfortunately, as 50 year old woman I've seen lots of my friends tolerate this stuff that they would never have put up with 25 years earlier! The fact that she won't go to Xmas with her own grandchildren without him makes me think he's made it clear that's unacceptable.", "Why can\u2019t the mom choose not to come ?", "No. It\u2019s not. I couldn\u2019t think of a worse time to introduce someone new into a family than at a large family gathering like Christmas or thanksgiving.", "Holidays are never a good time to first introduce your partner to your family. There\u2019s way too many expectations and the potential to ruin the whole holiday. I think suggesting they host a get together where everyone can meet the bf is the right move. \n\nAt this point has she told anyone besides you and your sister about her bf? Was she planning on springing him on you all on Christmas? NTA.", "Seems obvious to me. He's a mob hitman. Also, what the hell is a steam pudding?", "She can, should\u2019ve been more clear the mom is the AH for blaming her choice on OP. Poor wording on my part", "MOM knows who he is.", "Or the Mom WANTED him there. Why the immediate jump to he's controlling?", "It\u2019s a British dessert using sponge cake.", "He\u2019s not coming", "It's a crap rationale though. OP has put the most negative of connotations on this man for no reason.", "OP gets to decide who goes around her kids and the fact that she doesn\u2019t know anything about him and he was kept a secret goes a long way. It\u2019s OP\u2019s party, OP gets to decide who goes full stop. It\u2019s like anything, there will be consequences to making this decision but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an asshole\n\n\nMy mom dates and she always has me meet her boyfriends on neutral ground like a restaurant or her house even though I\u2019m 25 and live on my own. She also doesn\u2019t push meeting the guy on me or use time we were previously going to use for bonding between the two of us. Her mom wants to use their family Christmas to introduce him. That\u2019s kind of crappy. OP knows her mom best and should listen to her gut.", "Yeah, I wouldn't risk Christmas on this guy. He sounds weird. Maybe next year, D, once you come out of the shadows.", "NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA \n\nMy family had a rule when we were younger that we couldn't invite boyfriends/girlfriends to holidays or family events unless we had been dating for a year or more.\n\nSeemed weird at the time but I am happy our family photos do not have random strangers we no longer talk to in them.", "NTA.\n\nMum's shady behaviors and lying led to her consequence.", "NTA", "NTA she is the one who had made the choice to be sneaky, crash something she already agreed to not bring partners to ( and did it like a complete weirdo and treated him like some shameful secret  but still asked him to come ) and now is trying to insert him likes he's been there all along,, yet you're the asshole to her?\n\nSomeone needs a reality check that she isn't the sun, moon and stars and the world will continue to turn whether she and \"D\" came or not.", "Nta\n2 months is too soon to meet the family, ESPECIALLY on a holiday.", "Nta", "Can we have the steam pudding recipe?", "NTA. Does your sister ACTUALLY think that, or is mom leaning on her to sway your opinion? It seems pretty telling that everyone who hasn't met D and who isn't in daily contact with mom is on your side.", "Xmas isn't. Theres sound kids and no one knows who this man is. The mom doesnt even talk about him. He also stalked their girls night. There's been plenty of other times they could have met. A large gathering that is meant to be intimate and comfortable isnt the place for this. Especially if everyone isnt comfortable with the idea. If everyone is clearly perturbed by this, there is a reason. \n\nNo one is isolating her lol the guy stalked them to multiple places and no one said she cant date, that he is banned. Just one single event they dont want him at. You're reaching. Massively.", "She can keep things to herself for whatever reason. but then can't turn around and be mad that a complete stranger that no one knows a thing about isnt wanted at a intimate family gathering especially with children. A meeting during lunch or dinner is typically how people meet the first time before bringing them to their homes with kids.", "Well technically she met him at the girls night and if we are making expectations based on that night, then well he was a creep and a flirter that night who was constantly hitting and following them. So yeah his first impression was not the best.", "Um...because as a parent, the responsible thing to do is screen adults that will be around your kids. It would be very irresponsible to do otherwise. \n\nI met the parents of my kids' friends, even as teens, and I expect them to want to meet me. That's how you parent. \n\nWhy? GMAFB.", "What a miserable way to look at the world. \n\nOf course a family member should be entitled to bring her partner to the Christmas party.", "No room at the inn for strangers at Xmas? Maybe space in the barn, then? Really living that Xmas spirit.", "OP should absolutely do a background check,  this sounds so sketch.", "Yeah. Mom does. No one else. so theres everyone else to consider, including small kids. Majority rules. Everyone is uncomfortable. And theres a reason that all of them have an odd feeling about this.", "Either you've never been around or dated, had friendships etc with certain behaviors, however a person who knew there was a strict only girls to an outing and the guy shows up, followes to multiple locations and then slinks back whenever other people approach is a red flag. Boundary crossing at the minimum. \n\nA mother refusing to come to Christmas because her boyfriend of only a few short months that no one knows about is also a red flag. The whole \"well they arent inviting me are you going to let your family do that to US???\"  Is typically the response. \n\nNot to mention there's young kids going to be there. No one knows if he has a bad past or track record. Bringing a mysterious (which he is. No one knows a SINGLE thing about it him except for one sister and even that info is limited) no one knows anything about him and it's not only bad practice but irresponsible to allow someone into a gathering where no one knows a single thing about him. \n\nThere's red flags based on the info we have. There's info that suggests there's potential control issues at play. No previously super involved mother will choose to abandon her family for a man she has known for 2 months. it's odd and when something is all the sudden out of normal character / behavior there's a reason behind it and the only new variable is this new guy. \n\nHe could be a wonderful man. But no one knows cuz he literally slinks around in the shadows and no other attempt has been made for introductions, mom hasn't told ANYONE a single thing about him, and when multiple people are uncomfortable about the first meeting being at a gathering it should be respected and its odd that the mom seems to be clouded with her judgment on it.", "That\u2019s not true. Maybe she didn\u2019t want to introduce her family until she felt comfortable with him that it was going somewhere. I can\u2019t help but think this is a little ageist. Like if it were OPs 23 year old sister wanting to bring her college boyfriend to dinner and mom said no everyone would be saying moms the AH.", "Yeah, it\u2019s because they\u2019re infantilising their mother. \n\nPerhaps daughter feels mother wasn\u2019t accepting enough of a teenage boyfriend. And now it\u2019s payback time.\n\nMother is entitled to choose her partner, and daughter should accept him.", "Just like mother is entitled to choose her partner, the same way daughter is entitled to not choose mom's partner and invite him to her house.

I\u2019d hope mom would have allowed you to bring a uni BF to Christmas dinner in years gone by!?", "YTA - you should have acted like an adult and go meet him if he came to your girls night, not pretend he wasn't there. And why would you not meet him during Christmas? Why NYE and not Christmas? The important thing is to meet and that your mom is happy during Christmas, would you accept going to her house by yourself and leaving you BF alone on Christmas because she wouldn't allow him in her house? For no reason other than she hasn't met him?", "NTA - this is a family event, he isn't family and hasn't even been introduced. Your mom is acting like a naughty teen.", "NTA but have you considered your mom is in an abusive relationship? It\u2019s super suspicious that he insisted on coming to girls night AND attempted to keep it secret/had your mom keep it secret the entire time. You may need to get her help.", "NTA, but you both are going to have to choose your battles and be okay with those decisions and the outcome it produces. Your forcing her to choose, but if she choose to spend it with her guy, your feelings are going to be hurt, mom is not cool with not having her guy there so either way somebody's gonna be unhappy, and she is still going to be your mom after the holidays so what is your battle worth?", "YTA. Just because it's your house your rules doesn't mean you're not an A.\n\nWhat's the big deal? Really? No...REALLY? Are you saying no just to say no? What's the real reason? It's Christmas...you know, time to come together and enjoy each other. Pretty sure Jesus, Mary, and Joseph didn't know the three wisemen before they showed up. Of course, it wasn't technically their house, but still.", "Nta", "Nta. This is someone you don't know coming into your home. Someone who is a secret and has shown they can't respect boundaries. However if your mom doesn't want to go that's her choice and no one can force her to do anything. I hope she really thinks if she wants this man as a long term partner as this is a very very poor first impression.", " **She then said she wouldn't come to christmas cause he's not invited and I'm an asshole cause now she's missing out on Christmas with her kids and grandkids because I won't let him come too.** Supreme passive aggressive move from your \"mum\" (just like the stint with having the BF come to the girls night out)..It's HER CHOICE for missing out on Christmas with her grands and children, not yours. Don't lose sight of that. NTA", "We had to create a strict \"No randos\" policy for holidays. Nothing like looking at family photos and trying to figure out who the hell these people are", "Yea, agree.\n\nStill being AH to OP and the family by picking him over them at Christmas. I\u2019d totally understand not inviting a dude to meet my kid for Christmas, and have planned for that in past. Mom needs to do better. \n\nnta", "Jesus, why isn't anybody trusting Mum's judgement? \n\nNo wonder she kept him a secret", "Mom is also GRANDMA.  She should wait.", "Sure daughter can choose not to invite her mother\u2019s partner to Christmas. \n\nBut that makes her the asshole.", "Why, tho? If your mother was to ask you to invite a stranger to YOUR house (which has kids) just because your mother, who has a bad history, knew her for only two months, would you do that. And hell he is not even a stranger, if OP didn't ask her mother on the girls night if he was the same guy, he was more like a creep to OP.\nEdit: grammer mistakes", "You need to put your foot down immediately, how dare she have a private life at her age, next thing they\u2019ll be holding hands in public.", "YTA\n\nHave you never introduced a date at Christmas? I see that the relationship is annoying and possibly problematic. Honestly you probably should meet him before things get more serious since there seems a possibility for him being weird.", "For now, I am going to go with NAH, but that could change. If one of your siblings wanted to bring a new BF/GF with them, would you tell them no the same way? If not, then I would have to ask why. \n\nYour mom could bring him and introduce him as a friend and keep things between them tame for the kids but it sounds like she may not have the self-control right now. Quite frankly, kids don't need to see any couple going at it at a holiday party.\n\nThere is more going on here than meets the eye. I have a feeling no matter how your Mom broached the subject, you would find an issue.", "NTA- but here\u2019s the thing, let\u2019s go back to the start. She\u2019s trying to date. It\u2019s hard when you want to casually date and  get to know and assess someone when your whole family are being nosey and having attitude and opinions about it. Your mum is allowed to date, she\u2019s allowed to get to know someone without questions and attitude, and the whole process being stressful and ruined. She\u2019s allowed to be happy. At the start you\u2019re speaking about her as though shows doing something wrong. She\u2019s not. \n  She obviously is nervous about your reaction, she believes it will be less than supportive, and she\u2019s trying to introduce him to you without you being mad. You seem to be almost sneering at her in the way you speak about her. . \n  Is she a good mum? Does she love you? Is she supportive? Could you maybe be supportive in return? \n She wants to show you off, you\u2019re special to her, shes proud of you, she\u2019s happy and she wants to share it. What is your end goal here? A good close relationship with your mum? You are two adult women, both of you are entitled to a private life and a love life, so what type of relationships are you building? \n Life is short, it\u2019s hard, and it\u2019s painful. If you have good people around you be kind to them, and treat them the way you want to be treated. When we love someone we want them to be happy, we go out our way for them. \n  It sounds as though you\u2019re missing your mum and want to spend time with her. Why don\u2019t you speak to her and tell her that, (if that\u2019s the case.) Organise some time with her, make plans just you guys, tell her how important it is to you, but meet the boyfriend and be nice. There are a lot of shady characters out there, don\u2019t let her become isolated from her family. \n  I know she\u2019s your mum and you probably aren\u2019t thrilled at the idea of her dating, but she\u2019s a person too. We\u2019ve all just survived a very lonely and sad few years, a lot of people really struggled with it and are desperate for connection. \n Whatever you decide have a lovely Xmas.", "NTA\n\nIt's your house and you have the right to only invite people you know and are comfortable with. \n\nUsually if I'm hosting a holiday party, family or friends, and I know someone has a SO I always extend the invitation to include the significant other. Do what feels comfortable for you.", "Christmas is not the time to introduce the family to a bf of 2 months.

Red flag! \n\nNTA", "Nta, it's kinda sad this guy was bar hopping on your girls night to spend a couple of minutes chatting to your mum before having to scurry away when one of you came over to her.", "I keep my dating life completely separate from my kids and grandkids. I don\u2019t consider them family because I don\u2019t intend to ever marry again. I\u2019m not insecure or dependent enough to need a partner at a family event.", "NTA - as someone who has had to get used to a parent dating again, lemme just say I feel for you. You are totally allowed to set those boundaries and I believe the BBQ idea you offered was fair enough. She's the one choosing to miss out on Christmas because she can't bring her boyfriend that she was secretive about to begin with.", "Nta it\u2019s your house and I don\u2019t think Christmas dinner is the most appropriate time to meet her maybe if she introduces him ahead of time to all your siblings and you guys can get to know him so your Christmas doesn\u2019t end up revolving around your mom\u2018s new relationship", "NTA but I think your mom has gotten ahold of a huge controlling\ud83d\udea9 of a man!", "Why doesn\u2019t he have family/friends/people to see on Christmas?

This situation sounds really strange to me, is Mom mentally ill?", "Or D is controlling", "I dunno about you, but to me Christmas is about spending time with loved ones. My mum's bf that I've never met (and wouldn't have known about unless someone broke a promise) isn't family or a loved one.", "Bringing your bf to dinner and having him meet your family then is very different than bringing your bf to your family Christmas party and having him meet your family.", "How is what I said not true?  You basically said the same thing I said in your second sentence.", "Uhm if you say so\u2026 seems pretty normal to me like plenty of people meet at family get together that happen around the holidays\u2026had plenty of friends who brought boyfriends from college home to meet their family on thanksgiving or Christmas or something again ageist but whatever."]}
