By this time my sister had told my mum that I knew about D so I specifically told my mum it's a girls night we're not bringing partners. She was super excited and was like yep definitely just girls. So we go to our first cocktail bar and we're having a good time singing kareoke and I notice this guy hanging out by my mum but walking away when I would come back to the table and one of my friends even mention like \"hey I think that guy is flirting with your mum' and we have  a laugh and carry on then we go to the next bar and 15mins later that same guy is there with my mum again so mum and I are in the bathroom together at one point and I'm like 'hey, is that D?' And she was like yeah I told him where we were. I was like mum it's a girls night!! We didn't argue or anything she just giggled and walked back out to him and I carried on kareoking with my friends and mum. I was getting drunk and having a good time and didn't think it a good time for introductions with D so we didn't meet that night.\nAnyway fast forward 2 weeks to lastnight and I rang mum to ask if she could make a steam pudding for Christmas (I'm hosting Christmas this year so all my siblings families and mum are coming and all though I will be providing the whole main courses I have asked each family to bring a dessert) anyway I call her up and she says oh yeah D and I will bring a steam pudding. I was like hold on a second D is not coming. She asked why and I said well I know very little about him considering you're keeping him a secret from us this whole time and the only thing I do know about him is that he crashed our girls night. I just don't think Christmas is the time to meet this guy you've been seeing for only 2 months. Maybe you guys could host a BBQ  in the new year and we'll come to that and meet him. She then said she wouldn't come to christmas cause he's not invited and I'm an asshole cause now she's missing out on Christmas with her kids and grandkids because I won't let him come too.\n\n3 of my siblings agree with me but my sister who has met him and knows more than we do because mum lives with her said I should let him come too.

In that time, she couldn't have decided if he was a guy worth coming out about? But, the whole girls' night out thing is just a next level weirdness. It's only after you found out that she now wants him to meet everyone? And, no, using a family Christmas gathering to do it isn't the time or place for it. As you state in the OP, have a bbq after the holidays where she can trot the guy out for a mass meeting.", "Because no one knows how he will act around kids and it is not the best idea to force them to be around and interact with strange adults, especially during holidays.", "It's not a party though, it's family Christmas... with children present.

You should ask her what her intentions were when she showed up with him at your house. Was he supposed to be a surprise or something? It's totally weird that she wanted him to be kept a secret, but expect him to be invited to Christmas.", "NTA I wonder why all the secrecy? My first thought is maybe he\u2019s married?

It feels like there\u2019s a specific reason that mom doesn\u2019t want the kids to meet him one on one, like having him over for dinner, maybe to avoid kids asking him too many questions? Like are you divorced or do you have kids and what do you do for a living. \n\nI just really feel like there is something mom is trying to keep under wraps here.

Op and her siblings are all adults. But the Grandkids are off limits.", "It\u2019s family only and you don\u2019t have strangers around young kids. Plus this man seems controlling. Stalking the girls night.", "Yeah, especially if it\u2019s only been two months I think mom is just excited", "Because as a parent it is the responsible thing to KNOW what kind of people/behaviors you are bringing into your home where your kids are. If this was a single mom who was dating and she after only two months tried to into to her kids, she would be being called irresponsible. \n\nThe mom should understand that since she chose not to be open with her adult children about her partner, who he is or setting up a way for them to meet him to meet her adult children before being welcomed to meet the kids. If she isn\u2019t willing/ready for that, then she needs to understand that Xmas is then not the time to be meeting this person for the first time. \n\nAlso sure Op\u2019s mom acting all secretive and sketchy about it, doesn\u2019t give the warm fuzzies towards this guy. Also mom is sounding a bit like a mean girl! Or as though the sibling mom told us moms golden child bc why can one of the adult kids know but not the others?", "Sure, older people are more likely to know what they want blah blah blah. None of that excuses the fact that they both deemed it appropriate to crash a girls night.\n\nThe fella should have said \"babe, it's your night, enjoy yourself\" rather than \"I'll be inconspicuous at the bar like some weirdo\".\n\nLikewise, he should be more socially aware that Xmas isn't the best time for introductions to the entire family.", "I think you should add this additional rationale to the post."]}
