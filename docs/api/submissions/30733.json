It wasn't a particularly big area and took at most a couple of minutes; the usual technique was to swipe left and right whilst walking backwards, with an occasional squeeze and dip in the bucket.\n\nAnyway, we once had a student come in on a (paid) trial shift for a part time job, and she was so nice, and really good with the customers--a proper people person. However, she just couldn't get her head around simple tasks and kept messing up orders all evening. Not a big deal, I'm not arsed about wasting my boss' money, and it wasn't a very busy night.\n\nThen when it came to closing time we asked her to do the mopping, and she said she'd never mopped before, but was happy to try. I wouldn't in a million years have envisaged how she tried to mop. It was like watching a an avant garde dance routine. She was spinning round, pumping her arms like pistons, going backwards and forwards. Using so much energy and covering so much ground, yet still missing most of the surface area. \n\nIf it was weaponised incompetence then she must've been a method actor because she kept up the persona for a good six hours straight.

I'm offering an explanation as to why somebody might do this that doesn't point to any malicious intent and relates to something I personally struggle with!

The point isn't that he has autism, the point is that if he did it'd kinda make all of these \"throw the whole man away\" and \"he's stupid and incompetent\" and \"weaponized incompetence\" replies seem REALLY insensitive and cruel.", "I didn't diagnose anyone with anything.
