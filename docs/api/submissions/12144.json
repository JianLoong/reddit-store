Before I came here I never did night shifts at my work (medical). They are a big responsibility, so when I started, my boss said that I should wait a while. I attempted to start at the beginning of the second month, but boss said I wasn\u2019t ready yet so I only begun at the end of the second month.\n\nWell, all the night shifts are divided between the juniors. We are 8 in total. The day after a night shift is usually off, and weekend shifts are only during the day (no night) and double pay, so everybody avoided Fridays (since there is no day off afterwards and you spend your whole Saturday sleeping) and wanted to do weekends (for the double pay and no sleep lost).\n\nWhen we divided the night shifts the second time (the last three moths of the exchange) my colleagues insisted in dividing them when I was away on my vacation - so they chose for me, I just said yes/no. I have less night shifts than my colleagues. However, I have the correct number of Fridays and only have half the number of weekend days I was supposed to have. I said nothing since I didn\u2019t do any night shifts for the first two months so I figured it\u2019s fair. \n\n\nTHE PROBLEM: One of my coworkers - 27F (the only one who I can\u2019t stand, but we didn\u2019t have any conflict until now) decided that she wants to leave for vacation in a particular week and needed to get rid of her night shift. \n* I told her that I couldn\u2019t do it for her since that would be 3 night shifts in 5 days which is too much for me. \n* She then attempted to have me switch one of those 3 with another colleague so I could take her shift, which I agreed to, but the only colleague who wanted to switch with me had shifts that I couldn\u2019t do (during vacation). So I had to decline.\n* Her last attempt was to ask me to switch my Sunday night shift with her Friday one. I agreed, under the condition that I get to keep the Sunday pay (this is where I might be an asshole - but I felt that if I do her a favour and take the worse shift she might as well let me keep the money)\n\nShe the started throwing a fit over text, saying that she has been more than accommodating to me (?) and that I should help her since I have less shifts than everybody else, and that she won\u2019t be there that week and that I should just figure out what to do with the shift. I told her it\u2019s not my shift so not my problem and gave her my arguments why I think she\u2019s unfair (I did the Christmas-which I took over from her - and Easter shift, the fact that I have enough Fridays, the two months I didn\u2019t do - which she said should be still taken into account, etc). She would not have any of my arguments and said she won\u2019t be there for her shift and to figure it out. \n\nAITA here? I feel she was way out of line, especially since I made two attempts to accommodate her, but on the other hand I could have helped her without expecting anything in return.", "created_utc": 1678646269, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pm1ms/aita_for_not_taking_a_coworkers_night_shift_so/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You aren't required to change shifts with anyone.  Sounds like you're usually accommodating but it's just not working this time. You made reasonable counter offers.  Why should you give up pay?", "NTA. You have already made a couple of attempts to accommodate your coworker, which shows that you were willing to help her out despite not being obligated to do so. It's understandable that you couldn't switch your Sunday night shift without any compensation, as it would be an inconvenience for you.\n\nYour coworker's reaction to your refusal was immature and inappropriate. She cannot expect you to solve her problem just because you have fewer night shifts than her. It's not your responsibility to figure out her scheduling conflicts, especially when you have already made an effort to help her.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the shift in question wasn't even yours to begin with. You're not responsible for covering someone else's shifts, especially when you have your own work schedule to manage.\n\nOverall, your coworker's behavior seems unreasonable and entitled, and you shouldn't feel guilty for standing your ground. You have already made a fair attempt to help her out, and it's not your fault that it didn't work out.", "NTA - Stop explaining yourself! It just comes across as justification and makes her feel she can argue.\n\nIt doesn't fit, so it is.\n\nShe planned it badly and that's not how anyone who asks for a favour behaves.", ">She would not have any of my arguments and said she won\u2019t be there for her shift and to figure it out. \n\nUm no, this is not your problem. You're not the manager or in charge of scheduling so there's nothing for you to figure out. \n\nYou do need to get ahead of this though. I would tell your manager that you have been more than accommodating to everyone and have tried to help out this coworker with compromises but none of them have worked so you are not switching your shift. This person is telling you they won't show up for their shift and is trying to blame it on you. NTA", "NTA. Night shifts are not for the feint of heart. I go to school during the day and work 30/35 hours a week overnights. I constantly have to swap my sleep schedule by either staying awake for 24 hours or only taking a small nap after a shift to fall asleep at night. \n\nPlus her attitude about it is unacceptable. You\u2019re not being unreasonable in not wanting the shift. You know you\u2019re limits, and even if it wasn\u2019t a big deal for you to take, I\u2019d still be spiteful and not take it since she\u2019s being disrespectful.", "NTA Overall\n\nYour co-worker was aware of the shifts and shouldn't have made plans for a vacation knowing she was expected to be at work or before confirming that someone else was definitely available to take the shift.\n\nYou should make it clear to everyone that you have prior commitments, that were made based on the rota'd shifts you were given, and that you feel it is unfair for you to have to change them due to your co-worker's failure to be organised. You should also ensure that everyone is aware that you will only be attending the shifts you have on your rota and will not accept any responsibility should your co-worker not be in attendance for hers.\n\nIt would appear that your co-worker is trying to shift blame and responsibility onto you. Send a clear text stating you will not be available to cover any of her shifts and that she should make alternative arrangements, and that you will not be be available to discuss the subject any further. If she doesn't turn up then there is no question of there being any miscommunication when more senior members wonder where she is, and later tries to blame you.\n\nExpecting to be paid for a shift you wouldn't be working, regardless of circumstances of it paying double, was an AH move.\n\nI don't think that the shifts covered/not covered for the first 2 months have any bearing on this shift change request. The choice to do Night Shifts was taken out of your hands by your Boss and NOT a choice made by you.", "ESH, Honestly you have no obligation to help her but one extra shift is not the end of the world in my opinion. I would personally suck it up and help her out, this is a great opportunity to show your ability to accommodate your coworkers and possibly build this relationship since she's the only coworker \"you can't stand.\" I think you should ask yourself as well, if a different coworker asked this of you, would you do it?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's bargaining. Trading away a daytime double time shift for a shitty overnight shift to accommodate someone else? Fine, I'll take the shitty shift for you, but I'm not going to lose the extra money. Agree to that or pound sand.", "Yeah, I would help another colleague. \n\nHer, I don\u2019t know\u2026 it\u2019s the general attitude but also small things. She asked me a couple times to cover her shifts (which were bad deals) and I sucked it up, but I kinda feel like she takes advantage at this point so I started refusing. \nAlso, when I asked her to help me with a similar issue to hers (nigh shift during planned vacation) she made no effort to help me at all.", "No, the scheduling  issue is that she plans to miss that shift.when coworkers  asked me to switch,  my answer is either  yes or no....no explanation. \n\nNot your problem.", "See in that case if it's all give and you get absolutely no accommodation in return that's completely different. If she's not willing to reciprocate and she's shown that previously, then yeah I wouldn't help her either", "NTA. Thet insisted on scheduling when you were on vacation so she should've gotten what she wanted without relying on you changing shifts.", "NTA\n\nIf I was her I\u2019d of been delighted to pay the extra money from the Sunday shift to you for working the Friday for me\n\nIs there any real consequences to her for not showing up, like if she calls in sick is it a big deal?\n\nIf it would be an all hell breaks loose situation with mega consequences I\u2019d maybe have made sure my other colleagues knew I refused the shift swap cause she will try and blame you", "Listen, while yes it is always nice to help people, you tried to be accommodating the best you could. Her getting an attitude while asking you to do her a favor is her first mistake. At that point I would have said no. Then her telling you it\u2019s your problem when it\u2019s her shift - now she can just fall flat on her face when it comes to the shift.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are fine to say NO.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: STOP discussing or defending it. NO is a complete statement.", "NTA - If there is additional pay for working a Sunday, and you are working it to accommodate her you should absolutely get that pay. It\u2019s not like she is doing you a favor.", "NTA. Seriously not your responsibility. Let her just hang herself by being absent. If they call you in regardless they'll have to pay you more to be there. Also requesting the higher pay rate is perfectly reasonable.", "OP - make sure you talk to whoever is in charge to note that so far as you are concerned, your colleague has abandoned the shift.\n\nYour colleague's language suggests that she is dumping it on you without your agreement. She may have told the powers that be that you are responsible for it, which could lead them to blame you if you do not make the situation clear to them up front.", "Good point \ud83d\udc4d"]}
