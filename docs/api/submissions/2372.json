She moved to the west coast and went NC for awhile from all of us until about 3 years ago. She moved back into our lives but we\u2019re not close. About 2 years ago, she asked my parents for money to put down on a house because she\u2019s tired of renting but they refused. They said their offer to pay for a 4 year degree and grad school still stands but they\u2019re not paying for anything else.

However, it\u2019s an expensive trip and it\u2019ll cost about $20,000 for my family (me, wife, 2 kids). Sarah is married with no kids but she can\u2019t afford to go so she asked our parents to pay for her and the husband to go. They again refused and said they\u2019ll still pay for her college at which point she blew up at them. \n\nShe called me to complain about how they\u2019re living in a crappy apartment, driving barely working cars, and have no savings and our parents refuse to help. I told her she made choices in her life and she\u2019s responsible for it. I said our parents are incredibly generous to still offer to pay for her college and it\u2019s still not too late. She hung up and I think we\u2019re about to go back to NC.\n\nAITA for taking this stance?\n\nUpdate: \n\nThank you for reading my post and commenting. I\u2019m going to answer some common questions. Growing up we were not upper class, we were middle class. My dad worked 7 days a week and 12 hrs a day at his business. They always bought used cars and would drive them until it got too expensive to fix. A couple of years ago my dad bought my mom their first brand new car as an anniversary gift and it was a Toyota Camry.\n\nMy sister has no learning disability that we know of and growing up she was a solid B student. I haven\u2019t heard any talks about trade school so I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re willing to pay for it or she\u2019s willing to go. However, since my dad was a business owner, he values \u201cmaking your own way\u201d so he has offered her money to start her own business. He told her to come up with a business plan and go pitch it at the banks. If they\u2019re willing to loan her money, he\u2019ll give her the same amount interest free. She never did it.\n\nMy sister is not a bad person, in fact she\u2019s normal as anyone in the room. She just doesn\u2019t like to be told what to do and will usually do the opposite just to get a rise. It was cute when she was a teen but now that she\u2019s in her 30s, it hasn\u2019t gotten her far.\n\nOur home country is on the other side of the world and the date is during the summer because of all of the kids being out of school. Because of it being the height of tourist season, the plane tickets cost about $2500 each. Then we have to factor in hotel cost during tourist season and other cost such as food and car rentals.\n\nWe\u2019re not 1%. My wife is a great attorney but she\u2019s not the type you see on TV flying to work in a helicopter and having a corner office on top of the Empire State Building. She also drives a Camry.\n\nI\u2019ll update more if there are any developments or other common questions.", "created_utc": 1668515522, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvvus5/aita_for_telling_my_sister_shes_responsible_for/", "score": 3963, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The issue here, is that as an adult who has seen first hand that other people's lives are much different/harder, your sister still doesn't appreciate the head start she had or the fact that she is where she is by choice.\n\nThe one concern I have about your parents' stance is that it doesn't seem to allow for the possibility that she is not academically inclined or may have some sort of learning disability.    Has she ever expressed any interest in a trade?", "NTA. She made her choice fully aware of not being financially supported by your parents.

I do think that college shouldn't be seen as the only possible path to success, but maybe the parents would be open to funding something different if it were a realistic plan, say for learning a skill that could become a job? That would be different than asking money for things she wants to buy or funds for trips.\n\nNevertheless, if the parents aren't open to that it is still their choice. If they only want to fund what they consider to be the surest road that is their prerogative, as it's their life savings and thus a decline in their standard of living in their remaining years that would pay for it.", "Her other paths haven't gotten her success.

(They had given equal amounts to my younger sisters, for the same reason, already).  For various reasons, I dragged my heels actually getting a place.  One day, my car went kaput.  so, I asked for some of the house money to replace it.  No dice.  It was meant for a house, and nothing else.\n\nI managed to replace the car, and finally bought the condo.  Replacement car is long gone, but I still have my condo, which I own outright.  It's been a lifesaver, because I'm immune to the crazy rent costs happening, while being very low income.\n\nI guess my point is - your parents were thinking long term benefits, not short term fun, when they put aside that money.  You aren't wrong.\n\nAs an aside - I don't think it's harsh for your parents to use their savings to enjoy life.", "Life is not linear and not everyone wants or needs to go to college to succeed.

Problem with trade school professions (if you can call it a problem) is they typically also have a maximum income ceiling. In my area you might start well above the 55k household median in a trade profession, such as 60-75k a year if you are working competitively, but might cap at 80-90k max because at that point your employer or clients will find you too expensive unless you are highly specialized (such as being an accredited welder).\n\n***In theory***, traditional college education fields have a wider/non existent ceiling. So even if you start at 40k you might be able to grow to the 200ks in my area, even with a humanities degree. ***In practice***, this is highly limited to only a few local professions tied to whatever your local industries are, plus the big ones of business, medicine, and law. But the perk is typically that you don't have much physical labor attached to achieving your income (unless you go into certain engineering and biomed professions requiring field work).\n\nThe real problem with both paths here is that the sister has no desire to apply herself.

Yes.\n\ntf?  They offered to pay for extensive higher education and that's harsh?  I got a garbage bag full of clothes and that's all I got when I left home at 17.  I would have been incredibly grateful for the offer of an education.  Instead, I worked two jobs and took out loans.  It's just amazing to me what some people consider 'harsh'.\n\nWhen did people become so entitled?  No one is obligated to pay for your college, not even your parents.  If they do, it's an incredibly generous gift.  Your parents are very generous and kind for making that offer.

The absurd rigidity of their rules clearly indicates to me that they have some deep issues with their basic values, and I suspect with the age gap OP probably wasn't present to see the way she was probably being derided by her parents for a lack of school smarts and ambition her whole life. It's possible, perhaps even probable, that she's unsuccessful because her parents have a single definition of success, and she was unable to meet it, so she had no support of any kind to find another way.", "Assuming she is capable of going to nursing school and has the right grades...", "Agreed.

Mortgage is usually cheaper than rent, but overall home ownership ends up being even if not more expensive, depending on how old a house you get. \n\nI'm sure parents would fund any form of job improvement - if they refused to pay for trade school or vocational training programs I'd have a different angle.

Colleges (mostly) are not designed to help students thrive. \n\nWhile asking her parents to fund her travels was kind of crappy, the sister was basically still a child. \n\nAsking for assistance with a downpayment on a house is definitely not an unreasonable request compared to how much the parents would have spent on OPs education and in today's housing market it is next to impossible to save for a house while paying sky high rent.\n\nI also don't think that asking parents for help for a once in a lifetime trip to celebrate an important milestone in their grandparents lives, and possibly one of the only times the vast majority of their family will be able to gather at the same time, is that unreasonable of a request either. \n\nThe parents are maybe slight a-holes for being so stuck in their idea that children need to go to college that they are unwilling to help their daughter when she needs it.", ">Did no one ever asked OPs sister why she didn't want to go to college? Sure it might be for pure, selfish, spoiled reasons but it could be for other things to.

She did the associates and they immediately eliminated the job, making her a patient care technician in the hospital. She had to go back for a second associates to get back into the lab as a lab tech because she was never capable of doing things like lifting patients. All the while, she was being called all around the hospital to draw blood from people that others couldn't get, because she was really, really good at it! There is a place for phlebotomists in healthcare, IMO, but knowing one, it's not a specialty that is respected or employed much, anymore, unfortunately.", "I agree.  I used to be a community college librarian and was impressed by the quality of the trade programs they offered and felt they didn't get enough respect.  \n\nOne thing I really like about my older son's school district is that they are working to offer programs that will allow students who don't want to go to college the opportunity to tlearn skills and get certificates that will allow them to get good jobs when they graduate from high school.  They built a state-of-the-art building that looks like the corporate HQ for a tech company.  There are programs in everything from engineering to prepare for a 4-year degree to culinary arts with a full-service professional kitchen. \n\nThey also have separate signing days for student-athletes, college-bound, and military/trade bound.

The one doing the medical assistant would\u2019ve spent less to become a nurse at a four year state college. But she didn\u2019t want to wait that long to start working. The other wanted to be a firefighter and really the only way to realistically be a firefighter is to become a paramedic first and also work in the forestry department fighting wild fires.", "Hey now, I went to Art school and make more than most of the people I know with engineering and law degrees.

No money for travel after high school? Fine, I'll go NC for 12 years. When they finally open lines of communication it's to ask for money for a house.

Besides, as entitled as OP makes her sound, I wouldn't be surprised if she tried getting a refund on the tickets for the cash. (I'm not sure if she could or if the card used would be refunded.
