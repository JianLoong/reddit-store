Growing up, our dad had his own small business and mom was an office manager. We lived a comfortable life but was not rich by any means. \n\nOur parents told us that they will pay for our 4 year degree and grad school should we decide to go. They made it clear that the money is for school only and not just free money. They stressed that if we decide not to go to school, they\u2019re not giving us the money for a house or anything. They said they worked hard for their money so they\u2019re going to retire early and enjoy their lives together. Once they pass, we\u2019ll get whatever is left but we should expect nothing because they\u2019re really going to enjoy their lives.\n\nDoes it sound harsh? Yes.\n\nIs it reasonable and fair? I think so.\n\nThey were setting us up for life as adults and growing up, I saw how much they sacrificed for us. I truly believe they deserve to enjoy the last half of their lives as they see fit. I\u2019m okay with receiving nothing. That is because I make a decent living as an electrical engineer with an MBA and my wife is an attorney. We\u2019re doing well.\n\nSarah, on the other hand, is not doing so well. She didn\u2019t listen to my parents and decided she wanted to travel after HS and not go to college. She asked our parents to fund her traveling but they refused and told her she\u2019s 18 and can earn her own traveling money. She moved to the west coast and went NC for awhile from all of us until about 3 years ago. She moved back into our lives but we\u2019re not close. About 2 years ago, she asked my parents for money to put down on a house because she\u2019s tired of renting but they refused. They said their offer to pay for a 4 year degree and grad school still stands but they\u2019re not paying for anything else. She complained to me but I agreed with my parents and told her it\u2019s not too late to get a degree and a better paying job. She didn\u2019t like my answer and went LC. \n\nThis brings us up to our current situation. Next year is a major anniversary for my grandparents who live in another country. My family and my parents are going there to celebrate along with family members from all over the world. This will be a huge family gathering with people from all over the world flying in and we\u2019re all excited to go. However, it\u2019s an expensive trip and it\u2019ll cost about $20,000 for my family (me, wife, 2 kids). Sarah is married with no kids but she can\u2019t afford to go so she asked our parents to pay for her and the husband to go. They again refused and said they\u2019ll still pay for her college at which point she blew up at them. \n\nShe called me to complain about how they\u2019re living in a crappy apartment, driving barely working cars, and have no savings and our parents refuse to help. I told her she made choices in her life and she\u2019s responsible for it. I said our parents are incredibly generous to still offer to pay for her college and it\u2019s still not too late.

Also warn her that when your parents pass, you won't be giving her any money.", "NTA but question - if your sister asked your parents to pay for technical schooling (culinary, cosmetology, trucking, etc), would they do that?

Your parents are not obligated to pay for anything for your sister, however, there's no need to mention college every time money comes up.

Fine, it\u2019s your parents\u2019 money.  They can spend or not spend it however they like.

You watched your parents struggle to make sure you had the life that your sister took for granted.   That's not at all unusual.   The issue here, is that as an adult who has seen first hand that other people's lives are much different/harder, your sister still doesn't appreciate the head start she had or the fact that she is where she is by choice.\n\nThe one concern I have about your parents' stance is that it doesn't seem to allow for the possibility that she is not academically inclined or may have some sort of learning disability.    Has she ever expressed any interest in a trade?", "NTA. She made her choice fully aware of not being financially supported by your parents. Now, if they refused to pay for a trade school (not everyone is cut out for college), I\u2019d think they were TA in that respect.\n\nBottom line, it is their money that they earned and they can do as the please since both of you are adults.\n\nWhy can\u2019t your sister put money to the side or get a side hustle/second job to afford traveling to see your grandparents?", "NTA. She fucked around and found out (my new favorite phrase, thanks, Reddit!)", "NTA. Your sister is and a very entitled one at that.", "NTA - It was her choice", "NTA. Well that family is pretty on brand with their shitty behavior", "NTA. We did the same thing for our daughters. They had four years to get a marketable degree at a private college. One daughter wanted to take off a year to snowboard. I told hr that is her choice, but all tuition and college expenses were her responsibility if that happened. \n\nYour sister made her choices and continues to make poor choices. Your parents are extremely generous to still offer to pay for her college.", "NTA\n\nParents rules are fair and clear.  As your sister is an adult, she (and her husband) are responsible for their lives - neither you nor your/her parents owe her anything at this point.\n\nAs you say, she could still take up your parents offer to get a degree and a better job/life.  \nIs your sister's husband just as feckless?", "NTA\n\nThey were clear about expectations and paying for college and grad school is a generous offer she could have used to set herself up with a career in a field she found interesting - I would suggest your parents could have offered to fund vocational training if the issue was solely that academics are not your sister\u2019s thing but frankly it sounds like what she wants is a free ride off your parents money as opposed to utilising their offer to make her own", "NTA - she has made her choices but still expects someone to take care of her.\n\nDoesn\u2019t want the responsibility to improve herself but more than willing to take what other people have earned.", "NTA. Sister has made her own choices. Just because she regrets them doesn't mean they're anyone else's fault. She's blaming everyone except the real person here to blame- the person in the mirror.", "NTA. Its kind of mind blowing that despite your parents being very clear and upfront about what they would pay for and what they wouldnt from the beginning; she keeps asking for shit theyve said no to before. Does she think they are going to get dementia and be like sure honey we'll buy you a house!? lol. If someone offered to pay for 4plus years of college Id jump on that shit quick fast and in a hurry! No college loans?!?! SHIDDD! Sister is not very bright. I would just go ahead and go NC with her cause you know what shes about and it doesnt seem like it'll change anytime soon. Have an awesome family reunion!", "My guess is that if your sister actually put together a plan to set herself up for a career, your parents would help.

I would advise you to help your sister come up with an actual plan on how to turn her situation around before asking for help.", "NTA. She\u2019s not entitled to their money. You are right, paying for college and grad school is very generous. Most parents can\u2019t do that. As a parent I feel that it\u2019s a logical choice. Making sure your child can get an education is good parenting. Learning them to be independent and responsible is good parenting too.", "NTA\nYour sister is an adult and she made her own choices. Those have consequences. \nShe is not entitled to your parents' money. It's generous enough they'd still be willing to pay for her going back to school.", "NTA-Parents have always been transparent with their terms.  It's their money.  \n\nAlso-there is nothing harsh about what they said, you and your sibling are fortunate that there was anything, and will be fortunate if there is anything left, you are owed nothing.", "NTA, and I don't think your parents reasoning sounds harsh at all.  They worked hard, offered to pay for college and grad school, which is more than a lot of parents are able to do. Now they want to spend their hard earned money on themselves. Your sisters poor choices are not their fault or problem.", "NAH. i know i\u2019ll get downvoted for this but I don\u2019t care. \n\nIt\u2019s reasonable for your parents to have expectations, but at this point they\u2019re intentionally rubbing a wound with salt and being incredibly manipulative imo. your sister has made it clear that she does not want to go to college, and it\u2019s not unreasonable for her to request some support from her own parents.", "NTA", "NTA. She\u2019s an adult. She made her choices and has no one to blame for her crappy situation but herself.", "NTA - but I do disagree with your parents a bit. Degrees aren\u2019t the guarantee of good employment they used to be. It\u2019s fair for them to set whatever boundaries about their money they like, but your sis could go study for four years and end up no better off than where she started. It\u2019s a little sad they won\u2019t consider any other measure of support except sending her to a classroom.", "INFO: What did your sister decide to do with her life? You don't need a college degree to have a fulfilling or valuable career, nor is money the most important thing in the world. Does she have a career that just pays badly (EMT?) or is she a SAHM? \n\nI agree that your parents can do whatever they like with their money, but it it seems like you and your parents wouldn't consider sister valuable at all without a high paying career.", "Is she just not cut out for college? Would they help her start a business or go to trade school? What\u2019s her reason for not going?", "Like, they are ***still*** offering to help her in a tremendous and meaningful way. A full ride through grad school would radically change her life.\n\nNTA", "I like that analogy", "It seems to me that the sister is involving him but going to him to complain", "It seems to me that if they have said they won't help he to buy a house, asking for money for an international trip would definitely be a no go.\n\nSis has had 15 years to make some kind of move toward stability.  If he wasn't inclined toward college, she could have enrolled in a trade program and put herself on an actual career path, one in which she could earn than most people with 4-year degrees.  She didn't apparently didn't do that, she just drifted.\n\nShe wants the house, the big trip, and whatever else, without doing the work.", ">Sometimes you have to bite the bullet for the greater good\n\nAnd there are cases where you see the thin end of the wedge for what it is and say no. Some precedents should never be set with certain people and the guard never lowered, as with those people the entirely predictable result will be them demanding a mile after you've given the inch, with exactly the wrong lesson learned.", "Yeah, the parents are being a bit petty now. You\u2019re going to let your daughter miss out on an anniversary for your parents? It\u2019s a big family gathering and she\u2019ll be the only one not there. I would be heartbroken if I was the daughter. I agree on everything else but this.", "OP clearly said she called and complained to him, he didn\u2019t reach out to her. If you\u2019re going to call someone, you might hear things you won\u2019t like.", "She is a grown woman. If she wants to do grown woman things, then she needs to fund them herself like a grown woman. Why should her parents pay for her poor life choices?", "The OP\u2019s sister is 33, not 13. How many parents still pay for their 33 year old and the SO to go on vacation?", "I think they are doing that because if she goes to school and get a degree, she won't have to struggle financially.", "This is apparently a $5,000 per person trip.  My husband and I have four degrees between us, and I don\u2019t know that we could swing that without a fair bit of planning.  Maybe Sarah hasn\u2019t been particularly strategic, but why is everyone here so hyperfixated on college as the only, 100% guaranteed path to life success?", "If they don't want to pay, they don't pay but I don't see how offering to pay for her to go to college is helping the sister. \n\nIf everytime she \"complains\" about money, they talk about her going back to college, I get that she is annoyed and tired about it.\n\nAnd if OP has to pay 20,000 dollars to travel with his family, nothing says that the sister wouldn't need help to pay for the travel expenses even if she had gone to college and had gotten a better job.", "Well, I agree with this point. I do think that college shouldn't be seen as the only possible path to success, but maybe the parents would be open to funding something different if it were a realistic plan, say for learning a skill that could become a job? That would be different than asking money for things she wants to buy or funds for trips.\n\nNevertheless, if the parents aren't open to that it is still their choice. If they only want to fund what they consider to be the surest road that is their prerogative, as it's their life savings and thus a decline in their standard of living in their remaining years that would pay for it.", "Her other paths haven't gotten her success. Some jobs, even entry level crap jobs, require at least a 2 year degree. Work experience should count, but only if you get work experience in the field you want, which most people don't get... and she doesn't seem particularly motivated to do anything for herself.", "Right. You are not guaranteed a well paying job just because you went to college. There\u2019s people I know who have a masters and its just collecting dust.", "Doesn't sound like the OP's sister has approached the parents with an alternative plan to college though.", "Oh, I know. I was just talking hypothetically."]}
