Growing up, our dad had his own small business and mom was an office manager. We lived a comfortable life but was not rich by any means. \n\nOur parents told us that they will pay for our 4 year degree and grad school should we decide to go. They made it clear that the money is for school only and not just free money. They stressed that if we decide not to go to school, they\u2019re not giving us the money for a house or anything. They said they worked hard for their money so they\u2019re going to retire early and enjoy their lives together. Once they pass, we\u2019ll get whatever is left but we should expect nothing because they\u2019re really going to enjoy their lives.\n\nDoes it sound harsh? Yes.\n\nIs it reasonable and fair? I think so.\n\nThey were setting us up for life as adults and growing up, I saw how much they sacrificed for us. I truly believe they deserve to enjoy the last half of their lives as they see fit. I\u2019m okay with receiving nothing. That is because I make a decent living as an electrical engineer with an MBA and my wife is an attorney. We\u2019re doing well.\n\nSarah, on the other hand, is not doing so well. She didn\u2019t listen to my parents and decided she wanted to travel after HS and not go to college. She asked our parents to fund her traveling but they refused and told her she\u2019s 18 and can earn her own traveling money. She moved to the west coast and went NC for awhile from all of us until about 3 years ago. She moved back into our lives but we\u2019re not close. About 2 years ago, she asked my parents for money to put down on a house because she\u2019s tired of renting but they refused. They said their offer to pay for a 4 year degree and grad school still stands but they\u2019re not paying for anything else. She complained to me but I agreed with my parents and told her it\u2019s not too late to get a degree and a better paying job. She didn\u2019t like my answer and went LC. \n\nThis brings us up to our current situation. Next year is a major anniversary for my grandparents who live in another country. My family and my parents are going there to celebrate along with family members from all over the world. This will be a huge family gathering with people from all over the world flying in and we\u2019re all excited to go. However, it\u2019s an expensive trip and it\u2019ll cost about $20,000 for my family (me, wife, 2 kids). Sarah is married with no kids but she can\u2019t afford to go so she asked our parents to pay for her and the husband to go. They again refused and said they\u2019ll still pay for her college at which point she blew up at them. \n\nShe called me to complain about how they\u2019re living in a crappy apartment, driving barely working cars, and have no savings and our parents refuse to help. I told her she made choices in her life and she\u2019s responsible for it. I said our parents are incredibly generous to still offer to pay for her college and it\u2019s still not too late.

You watched your parents struggle to make sure you had the life that your sister took for granted.   That's not at all unusual.   The issue here, is that as an adult who has seen first hand that other people's lives are much different/harder, your sister still doesn't appreciate the head start she had or the fact that she is where she is by choice.\n\nThe one concern I have about your parents' stance is that it doesn't seem to allow for the possibility that she is not academically inclined or may have some sort of learning disability.    Has she ever expressed any interest in a trade?", "NTA. She made her choice fully aware of not being financially supported by your parents. Now, if they refused to pay for a trade school (not everyone is cut out for college), I\u2019d think they were TA in that respect.\n\nBottom line, it is their money that they earned and they can do as the please since both of you are adults.\n\nWhy can\u2019t your sister put money to the side or get a side hustle/second job to afford traveling to see your grandparents?", "NTA.

She\u2019s an adult. She made her choices and has no one to blame for her crappy situation but herself.", "NTA - but I do disagree with your parents a bit. Degrees aren\u2019t the guarantee of good employment they used to be.

You don't need a college degree to have a fulfilling or valuable career, nor is money the most important thing in the world.

My husband and I have four degrees between us, and I don\u2019t know that we could swing that without a fair bit of planning.

I do think that college shouldn't be seen as the only possible path to success, but maybe the parents would be open to funding something different if it were a realistic plan, say for learning a skill that could become a job? That would be different than asking money for things she wants to buy or funds for trips.\n\nNevertheless, if the parents aren't open to that it is still their choice. If they only want to fund what they consider to be the surest road that is their prerogative, as it's their life savings and thus a decline in their standard of living in their remaining years that would pay for it.", "Her other paths haven't gotten her success. Some jobs, even entry level crap jobs, require at least a 2 year degree. Work experience should count, but only if you get work experience in the field you want, which most people don't get... and she doesn't seem particularly motivated to do anything for herself.", "Right. You are not guaranteed a well paying job just because you went to college. There\u2019s people I know who have a masters and its just collecting dust.", "Doesn't sound like the OP's sister has approached the parents with an alternative plan to college though.", "Oh, I know. I was just talking hypothetically.", "Absolutely NTA and neither are your parents! I applaud them for setting the boundaries they did and for sticking to them. Your sister had several chances and still does to better her life and get a college decree paid for by your parents, but she doesn\u2019t want to put the work in. That\u2019s absolutely her choice, but it\u2019s absolutely her consequence as well.", "NTA She is a grown adult who has been given solid chances in life, she made her own decisions now she has to live with them", "NTA\n\nThe money was put aside for a specific reason, and if she isn't going to use it for an education, she can't expect to get it.\n\nMy parents told me they had money put aside for me to buy a home, when I was in my late 30's.  (They had given equal amounts to my younger sisters, for the same reason, already).  For various reasons, I dragged my heels actually getting a place.  One day, my car went kaput.  so, I asked for some of the house money to replace it.  No dice.  It was meant for a house, and nothing else.\n\nI managed to replace the car, and finally bought the condo.  Replacement car is long gone, but I still have my condo, which I own outright.  It's been a lifesaver, because I'm immune to the crazy rent costs happening, while being very low income.\n\nI guess my point is - your parents were thinking long term benefits, not short term fun, when they put aside that money.  You aren't wrong.\n\nAs an aside - I don't think it's harsh for your parents to use their savings to enjoy life.", "Life is not linear and not everyone wants or needs to go to college to succeed. On the other hand, it doesn't seem like she's trying. I'm not sure making your sister fit into a mould made of your parents will solve anything. But then again what is her ambition beyond her parents? I think you could be more compassionate than judgemental.", "NTA. Your parents made it perfectly clear that the only financial help they will provide is for college. It\u2019s their money and their right to place conditions on it. It\u2019s her right to decide not to go, but it\u2019s ridiculous to expect something from them.", "NTA.  Your parents offer to help her over and over, but she does not want help.  Help means she still has to work, she just wants free money.", "NTA. But, quick question, would your parents offer to pay for a trade school or similar? College isn't for everyone but perhaps there is an alternate path that would fit her better.", "NTA, she was literally given a free ride but chose to get off it and go find a pay ride. now shes butthurt you didnt do the same", "NTA at all: your sister is a woman grown who believes she is still 19 and acts like it.

She figured she'd do what she wanted and eventually get her way. Geez the cost of the trip. That is wild. That is a hard one because it's likely last time anything like that will happen in the family with the grandparents and she will miss out on that. But she's also LC with the family and that's a lot. You're right she made her bed and got herself to where she is.", "NTA", "NTA. They gave her what they'd pay for, she called their bluff, found out it wasn't a bluff and got mad.

They had always told you there is college assistance but no other assistance, which included that if a child doesn't go to college that money would not be  put toward anything else in the future. You sister had a choice to make and she made it. Your parents are generous enough that they still have the offer standing that they will still pay for her college if she wishes to attend. Your not the AH here. You sister needs to take responsibility for her choices, and she should quit being lazy and go to school if she doesn't like her lifestyle.", "NTA. Your sister is having a hissy fit every time she is told \u201cno\u201d. Your parents set clear expectations of what their money will be used for. If she doesn\u2019t want to go to college, that\u2019s on her, but she can\u2019t complain that her life is harder because she doesn\u2019t make as much. She has options she is choosing not to exercise.", "NTA. Your parents set the boundaries with ***their money*** very clearly and what it boils down to is - you respected that and don't need their help, you did it yourself but are grateful for the offer.

Problem with trade school professions (if you can call it a problem) is they typically also have a maximum income ceiling. In my area you might start well above the 55k household median in a trade profession, such as 60-75k a year if you are working competitively, but might cap at 80-90k max because at that point your employer or clients will find you too expensive unless you are highly specialized (such as being an accredited welder).\n\n***In theory***, traditional college education fields have a wider/non existent ceiling. So even if you start at 40k you might be able to grow to the 200ks in my area, even with a humanities degree. ***In practice***, this is highly limited to only a few local professions tied to whatever your local industries are, plus the big ones of business, medicine, and law. But the perk is typically that you don't have much physical labor attached to achieving your income (unless you go into certain engineering and biomed professions requiring field work).\n\nThe real problem with both paths here is that the sister has no desire to apply herself.
