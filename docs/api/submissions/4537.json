The thing that struck me as really weird was wanting to continue traditions she had with other people in other cities with me where she lives now. I understand enjoying traditions but it was odd that she wanted to replicate them with me when they were things I had no interest in.\n\nShe had somehow offered to transport an elderly man on Thanksgiving, whose family was 30 mi away, so of course they included her for dinner and this went on for several years. She was surprised not to be included after his death. She thought she was a guest and they thought she was the help. Pretty sure she wasn't eating in the staff dining room only because they didn't have one. But this is what I mean by aspirational, she wanted to be with wealthy people, not realizing she provided a service and it was a transaction.", "NTA. This person is using you. They\u2019re testing the waters to see just how much they can bleed you dry.", "NTA. Familiarity breeds contempt. When someone does something nice for them, most people are appreciative of it; if someone does something nice over and over for an extended time the recipient can soon come to view it as an entitlement - that\u2019s what\u2019s happened here.", "NTA but you enabled her behavior for so long, it's partially on you. \n  You should of refused to pay for her a long time ago and the problem would of been nipped and maybe you could of stayed friends.", "NTA - sounds like it's time to stop covering her tab, since she's taking absolute advantage.", "My son had a couple of \u201cfriends\u201d like the OPs. They referred to him as ATM behind his back. He finally wised up and cut them off. Surprise surprise they drifted away and he\u2019s no longer the ATM.", "This is not uncommon when friends end up with very different salaries. If the girl making more wants to maintain the friendship, then yes she may have to literally help her friend afford other things. They are being split into two different classes.", "Yes people who have to support their adult families should just shut up while people who acknowledge they were born with a silver spoon should whine about it on reddit", "What do you get out of this friendship? What makes it worth to hold on to it?", "Guess why you are the friend she stuck with\u2026 cause you pay her way! The moment you stop paying, you wont hear from her again. She is using you", "It's not a friendship though. You're holding onto something that no longer exists. This person is using you to live outside their means and afford things they otherwise couldn't experience. You're being used as a credit card, except they don't have to pay you back.\n\nTheir reaction shows who they are, and that they don't like their ATM talking back or saying no. It absolutely sucks, but better this be done now then years and thousands upon thousands of dollars down the road."]}
