We are all come from the same background and when she first introduced him to me, I was dating my ex boyfriend who is from a different cultural background. Daniel told me I would burn in hell for dating him and that I am a whore for it. Jessi did stand up for me but told me Daniel is just joking. \n\nThat obviously left a bad taste in my mouth but I tried to see the good in him whilst also keeping my distance. The other day I was talking to Jessi and she told me that Daniel told her that after marriage, once Jessi is \u201cold, wrinkly, and ugly, he\u2019s going to start seeking out 18 year old girls.\u201d That turned into an argument between them which resulted in Daniel apologizing for what he said but then justified it by saying that \u201call men think this way.\u201d I immediately told her that Daniel is a disgusting and shallow person for even thinking this and that not all men think the way he thinks. I also told her that if I were in her place I would break up with him. Jessi snapped at me and said that as sad as it sounds, it\u2019s the truth and statistically, older men seek for younger girls. She told me that she will never open up to me because all I do is critique their relationship. \n\nAITA for calling Daniel a disgusting and shallow person?", "created_utc": 1695901959, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16udxlm/aita_for_calling_my_friends_boyfriend_a/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Given that this guy does seem to hold some, worrying beliefs, I'm sure if you force her to defend his beliefs herself, on their own merits, she'll probably realise that a man who has these kind of patriarcal, possibly racist views isn't going to be good for her relationship in the long term.      \n  \nOtherwise if she does defend these ideas and seems to legitimatly believe them, then at least you know that maybe you'll need to find a friend who is more compatible with you politically.", "ESH \n\nWhat a fun little friend group you all have there.", "YTA.

I understand where your hostility towards him comes from, but it\u2019s not your place to say these things, unless she opens that kind of dialogue. She just wanted to seek comfort, instead she got this. It\u2019s not nice to hear someone belittle a person you care about (even if you think your opinion about that person is valid).
