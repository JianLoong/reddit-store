At first I knew only one person in the group, but most of them are very friendly and it was easy to feel included, and despite not knowing everyone for long I just feel like part of the group. \n\nHowever, I recently started feeling uncomfortable with the behavior of one of my friends, who ill call B (20? F). B is probably the one I've talked to the least, I don't dislike her but I believe that she prefers to talk with people she knows for longer. This is not the part that bothers me: it bothers me how she acts around A. \n\nA (21F) is very extroverted and is the person that made me feel the most welcome in the group. It sometimes feels like the entire friend circle revolves around her, which is fair because she gets along with literally everyone. \n\nNow to the problem: B is very attached to A. I mean, way too attached. If they are both in the same room, 9 out of 10 times B will be right beside A. If A is for example laying on the couch, when B enters the room she sometimes will literally ignore everyone else and beeline to A, and sometimes just lay on top of her. No matter what the context is, she's always hugging or touching A in some way, and it's not even subtle. \n\nObviously I don't have anything against them being close, but I think A is just obliging B for the sake of peace. B doesn't act like this with anyone else nor anyone is as attached to A as B. Also, my other friends are more respectful of personal space so often A and B are the only two who are close together when we are all hanging out, and it's just awkward as fuck. \n\nFinally, one day I was talking with A (my other friends were around, but doing something else in the same room) when B just interrupts our conversation to hug A. A just laughed and continued talking but I found B's behavior very rude. \n\nSince im not as close to B, I decided to speak to A about the situation. A few days later I brought it up when we were alone. I told her that she should speak with B and establish some boundaries. She just kinda shrugged and changed topics, but I insisted saying that B's behavior was uncomfortable to see, especially when it's all of us hanging out. I specifically mentioned the incident of the other night. To my surprise she just laughed, and said if it really bothered me I should just \"close my eyes\". I warned her that if she kept letting B act like this people could get wrong ideas. Finally, she told me to keep to myself, and pretty rudely told me to shut up. \n\nI was surprised since A had never talked to me like this. I was only expressing how uncomfortable I was and I don't know why A was defensive since B is the one in the wrong here. Maybe I should have talked to B directly, but either way I wanted to know if really I'm the asshole here.\n\n-\n\nEDIT: many people here seem to believe A and B are dating, maybe I made it sound that way. If it's any relevant, they are not. If they were I would at least understand why B is so attached.\n\n-\n\nEDIT2: it seems people seem to believe I have romantic feelings towards A. I would have said so if I did, but I don't.\n\n-\n\nEDIT3: I guess by this point it's relevant to clarify that I agree that I approached the issue in a very bad way, and that ill apologize to A as soon as possible.", "created_utc": 1674042919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10f5l57/aita_for_finding_my_friends_behavior_uncomfortable/", "score": 2526, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her reaction set a clear boundary that you should mind your own beeswax.  However, If it bothers you that she interrupts you, for example, you could say something like \u201cexcuse me\u201d and let her know you felt that was rude.", "YTA. Look, lots of people don\u2019t like witnessing PDA, but the way to handle that is NOT to disparage one member of the couple to the other, with a side of homophobia.

Continue friendship with all the group members. \n\n2) Continue to kick up a fuss and risk losing the friendship group. \n\n3) Leave the friendship group. \n\nEdited to add: 4) Don\u2019t hang out when A and B will be there if you\u2019re so uncomfortable with their interactions.

You were fine up until this point:\n\n> She just kinda shrugged and changed topics, but I insisted saying that B's behavior was uncomfortable to see, especially when it's all of us hanging out.\n\nIt sounds like up until this point you did the right thing. You mentioned to A in private that B's behavior makes you slightly uncomfortable, you are allowed to voice this concern, even though it's not really your place. But doing so doesn't make you an asshole. When she says it's fine with her, you should have dropped it and backed off. It's up to her and B to manage the boundaries of their relationship, you don't get a say in that. You insisting is what makes you an AH.", "Yes YTA because you didn\u2019t leave it be. Obviously A doesn\u2019t care about both what other people think and that B is clingy, it\u2019s their business and you wouldn\u2019t drop the subject when A kept trying to change the subject. She had every right to tell you to shut up and you owe her an apology.\n\nAt the same time, I don\u2019t exactly blame you for being uncomfortable. A lot of people don\u2019t like witnessing touchy feeling things right in front of them and what B did while you and A were talking was in fact rude since she interrupted. You do have valid feelings and you had a right to bring it up with A privately, but you took it too far.", "YTA. A and B's friendship is none of your business. A does not need to establish a boundary if they are comfortable with B's actions. B isn't doing anything wrong. Butt out.", "YTA.

Different folks have different levels of tactile/interpersonal rapport they're comfortable with. A and B are fine with how they are. A has told you this by not showing any signs of having an issue with it, by politely brushing past your \"observation\" and finally telling you to mind your own business. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf that's not enough of a hint that it's not up to you to police how they interact around others I don't know what is.

You don\u2019t know her well, don\u2019t particularly like her and she\u2019s hanging all over someone you like.  And don\u2019t say you don\u2019t like A.  You do somewhat.  With that much observation of A you have some degree of feelings for her.  Because I bet if B was hanging all over someone else in the group you wouldn\u2019t care.

I would honestly suggest you speak to someone because it sounds like you might have a legitimate problem with reading and understanding social cues. \n\nYour best bet here would be to message A something like \" I apologize for repeatedly telling you that I thought B was being rude. I am sometimes uncomfortable in social situations and have trouble with boundaries and thought you might be the same. I understand now it's not my place to put boundaries up for you or to decide what you are comfortable with.

YOU are the one making something out of nothing.  Therefore, YOU are the one who has to change.  YOU.  The problem is YOU.  A or B do not have to change their behavior to suit YOUR comfort.  What YOU have done is likely alienated new friends and made them uncomfortable to be around YOU.  Good job.  YOU are the asshole here.", "Sounds like you have a crush on A my good dude. YTA for policing how people interact.", "YTA it\u2019s not all about you", "You *told* her to establish those boundaries? YTA. Instead, you ought to have asked A if she was okay with B's behaviour.

They respect that we have known eachother longer and have our own boundaries set down since high-school that they can't change. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast time a guy did what you did and pulled me aside to complain we were affectionate I told them to drop it.

They are Not doing anything wrong. B is not wrong. A is not wrong. Even if you see it as awkward, that does not mean that they have to change their ways to appease you.\nObviously if they were making out and having sex in front of you, you would have a say. But all they are doing is being kind, touching, and affectionate with each other (especially B to A of course,) and A would say something if they were upset about this. This is between THEM, not you, not anyone else in the group. If you feel awkward and uncomfortable, just don\u2019t be around them.

Do you understand how boundaries work? Boundaries are about deciding between TWO people where one ends and the other begins.  A and B are both comfortable with their relationship, A has told you so, so for them they have healthy boundaries.  You might not feel like YOU would be comfortable with someone being that close to you, but this is between A and B so you should C your way out of this\u2026", "My working theory is that B is being used as a shield by A who wants party C to take a hint and fuck off.", "She tried to deflect, and you insisted on continuing to push your opinions, which were clearly not wanted or needed by A.

And maybe you're totally fine with that, but it's also okay to set boundaries if you're uncomfortable\".  \n\n\nSometimes people are afraid setting boundaries will make them look bad so I think it's okay to supportively give them reassurance. However, you were way out of line to keep pushing and insisting that B was doing something wrong when A has not indicated that to you.  \n\n\nThere could be a lot of reasons B is very physically affectionate and none of them are your business. As long as A is fine with it, there should not be a problem.", "INFO: You start off by sounding like you are concerned that A is simply putting up with this behaviour to keep the peace and you feel her personal space is being invaded against her will, but end it by saying the behaviour is making YOU uncomfortable, in other comments you say it is making the group feel awkward... which one is it? \n\nBecause it sounds to me like you were trying to be the hero, rescuing poor A from B (because you obviously have a crush on A) but when A told you to stay out of it you took the \"it makes me uncomfortable\" route.

I repeat: none of your business.\n\nNow, if you were truly worried that this is bothering A in some way, the best course of action is to let her know you are there for her if she needs someone to talk to about this (but again, you are brand-spankin' new to this group, so it's a bit pushy). If you don't like seeing PDA between friends (or even lovers), that's your prerogative, but again, none of your business.", "YTA.

No, we're not dating! But we immediately felt a sense of ease and comfort around each other and it was nice to express that. It's not like we isolated each other from the rest of our friend group \u2013 we both spent one on one time with plenty of our mutual friends.

You trying to say that you\u2019d want them to police you, is both laughable - since you internalize none of their input when it\u2019s given - and indicative of more you problems: healthy, assured people - seemingly like A - do what A did in this case, and they hold their own reasonable boundaries - even if that causes discomfort in others. I am going to assume that you\u2019ve missed a few things in deciding to lead with \u201cjust tell me if mis-socialed\u201d: that requires others to constantly be responsible for your behavior, given your reactions I don\u2019t think you\u2019d respond well to that correction IRL, this is peak ASD (and admittedly might work better in long established relationships with other ND folks), and unfortunately social cues that direct aren\u2019t typically considered socially appropriate - you, in this post alone, call out any such direct behavior as \u201crude\u201d. The concept is flawed, the execution is worse. \n\nYou need to address why seemingly any kind of physical affection - in spite of it being consensual and quite normal - makes you so deeply uncomfortable. This would be fine on the street: it doesn\u2019t need to be relegated to behind closed doors. That\u2019s an utterly absurd mandate from you, OP. You think hugs are inappropriate for public consumption (and not even really public, since it sounds like you\u2019re hanging out in a closed group). Adult sex education might be beneficial for you. Certainly this response is both severe and abnormal enough to warrant parsing with a clinician or other therapeutic structure. \n\nIt seems like the fact that not all interpersonal relationships are uniform in their depth and expression makes you insecure and uncomfortable: why? This easily could be an ASD thing. It could be a self esteem and feeling of security issue. It could be jealousy. It could be a lot of things: you need to do that work to unpack it. \n\nYes, YTAH, and you need to do some serious work on how to interact socially with others!", "INFO - what is your cultural background?", "Info: how does this impact you at all?", "Also I can\u2019t believe you acted surprised when she snapped at you, you should remove yourself from that friend group because you\u2019re going to do nothing but bring them down.
