At first I knew only one person in the group, but most of them are very friendly and it was easy to feel included, and despite not knowing everyone for long I just feel like part of the group. \n\nHowever, I recently started feeling uncomfortable with the behavior of one of my friends, who ill call B (20? F). B is probably the one I've talked to the least, I don't dislike her but I believe that she prefers to talk with people she knows for longer. This is not the part that bothers me: it bothers me how she acts around A. \n\nA (21F) is very extroverted and is the person that made me feel the most welcome in the group. It sometimes feels like the entire friend circle revolves around her, which is fair because she gets along with literally everyone. \n\nNow to the problem: B is very attached to A. I mean, way too attached. If they are both in the same room, 9 out of 10 times B will be right beside A. If A is for example laying on the couch, when B enters the room she sometimes will literally ignore everyone else and beeline to A, and sometimes just lay on top of her. No matter what the context is, she's always hugging or touching A in some way, and it's not even subtle. \n\nObviously I don't have anything against them being close, but I think A is just obliging B for the sake of peace. B doesn't act like this with anyone else nor anyone is as attached to A as B. Also, my other friends are more respectful of personal space so often A and B are the only two who are close together when we are all hanging out, and it's just awkward as fuck. \n\nFinally, one day I was talking with A (my other friends were around, but doing something else in the same room) when B just interrupts our conversation to hug A. A just laughed and continued talking but I found B's behavior very rude. \n\nSince im not as close to B, I decided to speak to A about the situation. A few days later I brought it up when we were alone. I told her that she should speak with B and establish some boundaries. She just kinda shrugged and changed topics, but I insisted saying that B's behavior was uncomfortable to see, especially when it's all of us hanging out. I specifically mentioned the incident of the other night. To my surprise she just laughed, and said if it really bothered me I should just \"close my eyes\". I warned her that if she kept letting B act like this people could get wrong ideas. Finally, she told me to keep to myself, and pretty rudely told me to shut up. \n\nI was surprised since A had never talked to me like this. I was only expressing how uncomfortable I was and I don't know why A was defensive since B is the one in the wrong here. Maybe I should have talked to B directly, but either way I wanted to know if really I'm the asshole here.\n\n\nEDIT: many people here seem to believe A and B are dating, maybe I made it sound that way. If it's any relevant, they are not. If they where I would at least understand why B is so attached.", "created_utc": 1674042919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10f5l57/aita_for_finding_my_friends_behavior_uncomfortable/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I recommend trying to figure that outb", "YTA. This is where you should mind your business lol.\n\nEveryone has different boundaries. If A is okay with it, why do you care so much? This has nothing to do with you. It is between B and A.\n\nYou are the one stressing over it. They are fine lol", "YTA - A and B have been interacting with each other for longer than you've been in the picture. You don't know what history  you missed, and you gave your input to your friend, which is important. At this point it would've been 100% N-A-H. \n\nBut then you kept going and pushing (edit on a re-read: _twice_ after A changed the topic). Which put you into A-H territory. Maybe they are FWB. Maybe B walked in when A was about to commit suicide and literally saved her life. _You don't know and it's not your business._", "I'm not sure why it even bothers you, they aren't affecting you at all.  Plus, there could be a dynamic you're missing, it certainly seems way.\n\nStay in your lane, or you'll be finding a new friend group.", "YTA\n\nIf A and B are both happy with this behaviour it's none of your business.

Then f-cking do that. If you tell B, you will be the AH. As long as A has no issues, why do you? \n\nI was in the exact same situation in HS - i was B of our friend group, and as the B, kindly and respectfully you can fuck right off :)", "YTA and let this be a lesson to mind your own business. It's not your place to decide how A and B interact. A tried to let you know, politely, that B's behavior wasn't a problem but you couldn't let it go, so you got put in your place. \n\nIt's not up to you to decide other people's boundaries.", "A and B as well as the rest of this friend group had established ways of interacting that worked for them long before you showed up.

It bothered you that B hugged A and how clingy they are to each other? I wish i had a friend that i could be clingy with. it is THEIR RELATIONSHIP with THEIR BOUNDARIES.

Some are closer to others, and it doesn't mean they're in the wrong. I'm struggling to understand why their relationship is such an issue for you.\nIt sounds like your feelings and judgements are the problem, and it will alienate your new group of friends", "Sounds like you like A and are just jealous lol", "YTA- but you can back down now.   Her reaction set a clear boundary that you should mind your own beeswax.  However, If it bothers you that she interrupts you, for example, you could say something like \u201cexcuse me\u201d and let her know you felt that was rude.", "YTA. Look, lots of people don\u2019t like witnessing PDA, but the way to handle that is NOT to disparage one member of the couple to the other, with a side of homophobia.

Just means that maybe this preexisting friend group isn\u2019t for you.", "YTA it's not You business how their relationship to each other is. In fact, it sounds like you are jealous or afraid that they are more than friends for whatever reason.", "YTA. A and B\u2019s friendship style is none of your business.

Thank you\u201d). Continue friendship with all the group members. \n\n2) Continue to kick up a fuss and risk losing the friendship group. \n\n3) Leave the friendship group. \n\nEdited to add: 4) Don\u2019t hang out when A and B will be there if you\u2019re so uncomfortable with their interactions.

Your behaviour is creepy and overreaching. \n\nA has changed the topic, laughed and told you to close your eyes. She's obviously fine with this.

You were fine up until this point:\n\n> She just kinda shrugged and changed topics, but I insisted saying that B's behavior was uncomfortable to see, especially when it's all of us hanging out.\n\nIt sounds like up until this point you did the right thing. You mentioned to A in private that B's behavior makes you slightly uncomfortable, you are allowed to voice this concern, even though it's not really your place. But doing so doesn't make you an asshole. When she says it's fine with her, you should have dropped it and backed off. It's up to her and B to manage the boundaries of their relationship, you don't get a say in that. You insisting is what makes you an AH.", "Yes YTA because you didn\u2019t leave it be. Obviously A doesn\u2019t care about both what other people think and that B is clingy, it\u2019s their business and you wouldn\u2019t drop the subject when A kept trying to change the subject. She had every right to tell you to shut up and you owe her an apology.\n\nAt the same time, I don\u2019t exactly blame you for being uncomfortable. A lot of people don\u2019t like witnessing touchy feeling things right in front of them and what B did while you and A were talking was in fact rude since she interrupted. You do have valid feelings and you had a right to bring it up with A privately, but you took it too far.", "YTA. A and B's friendship is none of your business. A does not need to establish a boundary if they are comfortable with B's actions. B isn't doing anything wrong. Butt out.", "YTA. It\u2019s a pre-existing relationship, leave it alone or you\u2019ll be looking for another friend circle.", "YTA for your behavior, you were way out of line when you said \"people could get wrong ideas\" and 100% deserved to be told to shut the fuck up\n\nfinding it uncomfortable doesn't make you an asshole, your behavior does", "lol this is like none of your business?! If A has no problem with how B acts then I dont see any issues. Well except you trying to force A to make b stop - for your sake not A's\n \nYTA.\n\nLeave both of them alone about this.", "INFO: Are you romantically/sexually interested in A? Are you uncomfortable with B being physically affectionate with A because you're jealous? Because it DOES just sound like a you problem if A has no issue with it and even participates. And if nobody else has an issue, it may be something you need to figure out on your end since the issue isn't on theirs.", "Y kinda TA. Different folks have different levels of tactile/interpersonal rapport they're comfortable with. A and B are fine with how they are. A has told you this by not showing any signs of having an issue with it, by politely brushing past your \"observation\" and finally telling you to mind your own business. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf that's not enough of a hint that it's not up to you to police how they interact around others I don't know what is. Whatever the reason YOU find it an issue, THEY don't. Are you into A an jealous? Are you just annoyed by B overall and using this as a reason to vent? Are you on the spectrum an all tactile interations irk you? \n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou're the issue. Not them. Shut up or you'll be needing to find another friend circle to hang out with.", "YTA.  If A does not feel uncomfortable with B getting into her personal space why should you? \n\nTruthfully OP it\u2019s sounds like your jealous of B.  You don\u2019t know her well, don\u2019t particularly like her and she\u2019s hanging all over someone you like.  And don\u2019t say you don\u2019t like A.  You do somewhat.  With that much observation of A you have some degree of feelings for her.  Because I bet if B was hanging all over someone else in the group you wouldn\u2019t care.  Or it\u2019s the two girl thing, and you\u2019re thinking that they maybe more then friends.  And that\u2019s a whole different TA situation.  \n\nA doesn\u2019t show signs of discomfort, she likes B and doesn\u2019t give a crap.  They aren\u2019t doing anything that would be considered highly inappropriate in public, no groping no nudity, hell they aren\u2019t even doing anything that would cause eyebrows to raise with most people.

I specifically mentioned the incident of the other night. To my surprise she just laughed, and said if it really bothered me I should just \"close my eyes\". I ***warned her*** that if she kept letting B act like this people could get wrong ideas. Finally, she told me to keep to myself, and pretty rudely told me to shut up.", "Then why do you care when it doesn't concern you? And it does not concern you, regardless if it's being done in a group setting or not. A is telling you directly that she has no issues and you're still making it an issue. What, do you suddenly know how she thinks and feels, despite her telling you otherwise?", "What did you mean by saying people could get the wrong idea? What is the wrong idea?", "> And? Is B sitting on you? I still don't see how it is your business. Some people are just more openly affectionate than others, there is nothing wrong with that \n\nI am not saying it's wrong to show affection. If B acted like this when she's alone with A obviously I wouldn't have anything against it. Is the fact that it blatantly clashes with the group dynamic and makes things awkward overall. \n\nI do agree that A might not have a problem, but my previous point still stands. And I definitely messed up talking with A too.", "Shit you are right, I definitely should have asked her", "I wasn't trying to control anything, I only wanted to express my thoughts. I stopped after A told me to shut up and I would have stopped sooner had she told me from the get-go", "Nobody explicitly said anything, but I cannot read minds. Besides, talking about others people backs is not anyone style in the group. That's why I talked with A directly", "I don't think it really matters, I was just clarifying that they are in fact not dating. If they were I would know, since there's no reason to keep it secret and A would have probably told me", "Because nobody else in the group acts like this, and it gets awkward when we are all hanging out together.", "... Why?", "Maybe my wording was wrong. I wasn't rude to A or anything. I do think I should apologize to her tho", "How? When you are the only one that complained? If they were a couple, do you think you would think the same?", "Your point stands, on its head.\n\nAs A said, if you. have a problem seeing this affection, close your eyes, and shut up. You're not the hug police.\n\n\"Blatantly clashing with the group dynamic\" is about as bogus a reason to press this as can be.\n\nYTA - Could it be that you wish it was you that was hugging on A?", "I bet if you acknowledge this to her, and apologize for your approach, she'll appreciate that and maybe even be open to a conversation about your discomfort with B. \nAt the end of the day, though, you might just have to accept your own dislike of B and decide whether you can politely tolerate her for the sake of the broader group. That's just how big friend groups are a lot of the time. And for what it's worth, I agree that B sounds annoying.", "She very clearly didn't want to speak about this from the moment you brought it up to her. When she changed the subject that was your cue to shut your mouth. You're an adult, she shouldn't have to spell it out for you.\n\nTelling you to close your eyes was even more explicit but you still kept going. \n\n  \nYou keep talking about how it makes the group dynamic awkward but you have admitted that nobody else in the group has said anything. You are making assumptions about a group of people you hardly know and it's a surefire way to get yourself kicked out of this friend group. \n\nThe fact that you're doubling down on this and arguing with everyone in the comments is crazy. You are so clearly the asshole in this situation.", "> wasn't trying to control anything\n\nDude, of course you were.", "So it did NOT make the group dynamic awkward, just you personally don\u2019t like it.", "Not dating doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not more than friends. Also, why are you so confident A would have told you? You are new to the group.", "It is only awkward for you. \n\nRead that again: it is ONLY awkward for YOU. \n\nEveryone else is quite comfortable. \n\nThe only person making things awkward in the group is you - and there\u2019s an easy fix for that: the group can remove you from it.\n\nThis will happen if you don\u2019t stop being a Rude Idiot.", "Maybe you should let the group decide how to handle how they feel about this. And it\u2019s perfectly fine that they act like this when others don\u2019t. If it\u2019s really an issue for a lot more people other than you, then have the group ask that they don\u2019t do it while the group is together", "Because none of this has ANYTHING to do with you!  You don't get to decide what boundaries other people need.  You are not the main character, no one asked you, and your opinion is clearly unwelcome.  So butt out.  It's creepy how invested in this you are, even to complete strangers on the internet.  Imagine how creepy it is to people who actually have to deal with you.", "Because A made it clear it's not your business when you pressed this issue and you made clear that B is shyer!!! LEAVE THEM ALONE!", "You were EXCEEDINGLY rude, even if you didn\u2019t cuss and yell.\n\nSeems like you have some feelings about A you need to process (get tf over). YTA.", "I don't see how that's relevant, they are not a couple. But if they were, I still think they should probably keep it in the bedroom", "I'll keep this in mind, thank you so much", "I admit I approached the issue wrong and I'm the asshole for that. But I don't think I'm making assumptions, I'm just  explaining what I see. Also I wasn't trying to argue with anyone, just felt that I should explain things further and give more context when necessary", "I believe it made things awkward because it's blatant how B is much more attached to A than to anyone else. It creates a weird dynamic", "Well A is just very extroverted, I find it hard to believe she would keep it a secret", "I'm confused as to why you believe I was being creepy, when I just talked with A directly and did literally nothing else.", "I really wasn't being rude, and I don't have any feelings towards A (we are just friends)", "Keep what in the bedroom? They're hugging not dry humping eachother infront of everyone \n\nI wonder if you'd be fine with it if it was a man and woman. No one else seems uncomfortable with it so you really need to learn to mind your own business", "It is relevant, cause couples act like that a lot in public. It's common. What I am trying to say is that there is nothing wrong with the act in itself. You seem to be the only one uncomfortable with it, doesn't that say more about it being a you problem?", "But you clearly are making assumptions. You are assuming that A isn't ok with B's behaviour. She has very clearly shut you down in that regard but you are still so adamant that A is just humouring B. You have absolutely no idea of their relationshup as you have known them for a very short amount of time and they have been friends for years.\n\nYou are also assuming that the entire group feels awkward about B's behaviour towards A but you have admitted yourself that nobody has mentioned it.\n\nYou then had the nerve to say in another comment that you were going to approach B about this after A very clealry told you to mind your own business.\n\nYou seem completely incapable of seeing beyond yourself and accepting that not everyone will have the same opinion as you. You really, really need to leave this alone if you want any chance of remaining friends with these people.", "Dude this group sounds like it was functioning well with them and their attachment before you came along. YOU are the awkward one.", "How does it create a weird dynamic? I\u2019m still not clear on what discomfort their affection causes the group.", "And yet you think she\u2019d put up with contact she dislikes? You have a low opinion of her, for calling her a friend.", "The main word we're looking for here is \"Private\" not a \"Secret\"\n\nEven the most extroverted people have things they want to keep private and unless you're in their inner circle, it's going to continue being private.", "It\u2019s creepy when a guy decides he gets to tell a woman what boundaries she can have with her body. (You going to B after A told you she\u2019s fine).  It\u2019s creepy that you think you know better then A does on what her boundaries are.  \nIt\u2019s the fact that you\u2019ve been told to drop this and you won\u2019t that make it even creepier. Your instance on stopping B makes you sound like a jealous obsessed person.", "if I was A and you talked to B about it now I would permanently block you on everything, don't be an idiot and leave B alone", "You really can't see that it isn't about you?  You were creepy the moment you inserted yourself into the situation and told A what she needed to do.  It is controlling, toxic, creepy, and unnecessary.  There is nothing about it that isn't creepy, frankly.", "YOU WERE RUDE, you may think you weren't but you're 100% wrong", "Do you understand that \u201crude\u201d covers more than swearing & bad language & raised voices. \n\n\u201cRude\u201d also covers saying things that you have no place saying - which is what you did. \n\nYour friend A tried to change the subject and you would not let her. That was rude of you!\n\nYou then continued to make a fuss about something she told you was not a problem for her. She tried to laugh it off, yet you continued to nag her on the subject. This was Very Rude of you!\n\nOnly then, after putting up with you making 3 attempts to \u201cwarn\u201d her about something she is not worried about, did she (quite rightly) shut you down. \n\nBut she was not rude. \n\nShe was frustrated at your continual rudeness. \n\nHonestly, you sound like you have a crush on her and are very jealous. She sounds quite happy with her friend\u2019s behaviour. The only person upset here is you. No one else. \n\nYou are new to the group. But you might not be part of this group for much longer if you don\u2019t stop being so rude.", "Stop saying you weren\u2019t being rude. You were, what you did was like the definition of rude. Denying won\u2019t make what you did any better. Mind your own business or find new people to be around. YTA.", "Methinks OP is interested in A and jealous of B. Clear AH tendencies from OP here.", "Obviously I do not know how it worked before I came along, I can only speak about what I see.", "I never said she dislikes B. They had known each other since very young and they are friends. But A doesnt seem as attached, and I believe she just humors B.", "Yeah it's such a weird thing to obsess over if he really only sees A as a friend.", "Right. And by your own admission, you read the situation between A and B totally wrong as, when you approached A to commiserate with what you perceived as her discomfort, she told you to MYOB. She is clearly cool with B\u2019s behavior and you completely misinterpreted how she feels about it.\n\n\nSo, your barometer on this situation is off. You should probably be careful about your assumptions as to the emotional state of others, because you\u2019re likely to keep running into situations where you are projecting your feelings onto others.\n\n\nAnd you may want to examine why their platonic PDA irks you so much. It\u2019d be one thing if it were sexual and made you feel taken advantage of as a result. But hugs and snuggles? C\u2019mon, dude. It hurts no one, yet it\u2019s triggering you. Best take some time to figure that one out.", "She has attempted to correct your belief, but you refuse to accept the information.", "Even if she is just humouring B, that\u2019s her business! It has nothing to do with you and isn\u2019t your place to police.", "A told you she isn\u2019t humoring B, yet you insist that A is \u2026. What? Lying? Unaware of her own internal thoughts? Too nice to tell B to stop? What exactly do you think is going on here? What do you think you\u2019re saving A from?", "Do you have a crush on A? Is that why you are uncomfortable?", "Well to clarify, A didn't say she isn't humoring her"]}
