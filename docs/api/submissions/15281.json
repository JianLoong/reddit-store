And currently I (23m) am responsible to look after my nephew (13m) since my sis (48) doesn't care about him.\n\n\n\n\nTonight, at dinner, we ordered our meals from outside since everyone was tired a lot. I ordered 8 portions of some sort of a burrito. None but 2 of them had parsley in them. The restaurant forgot to mark which ones had parsley in them. So everyone got their burritos and my nephew got the one with the parsley in it. He doesn't like parsley. So he started taking out every piece of parsley he could find.\n\n\n\nThen out of nowhere my mom's friend called out my nephew for taking them out. She said \"Are you stupid? You are wasting those juicy vitamins! Eat them!\" my nephew then said \"But I don't like them.\" Now, I'm most of the times a very chill person. I don't get offended or angry even if someone calls me an SOB, or something worse. But when it comes to my nephew, there's nothing I won't do. I said with an unusual anger \"You ain't no-one to him. You are not the one who decides what he can eat, ffs! If you are not happy, the f*cking door is there. Leave if you don't like.\" Everyone got quiet and finished their meal.\n\n\n\n\nAfter dinner my mom called me an AH for talking like that and said I should've stayed quiet.\n\n\n\n\nAITA?\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: I forgot to include this in the first place, but she nudged him 3 times on his shoulder pointing out the parsley on the table. Since this is an unacceptable behavior, I made my unacceptable behavior.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT 2: What I ordered was not actual burritos. They just look exactly the same but we call them something different.", "created_utc": 1682017793, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12tbuq9/aita_for_saying_to_my_moms_friend_you_cant_decide/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not only is she not even part of your family, but she started the namecalling. Obviously you could\u2019ve worded it differently, but I think a lot of people who have said that probably wouldn\u2019t have.", "NTA.

Your reaction went too far in the other direction.", "There is definitely a point where being a picky eater is grating, but Boomers are the fucking *worst* in their \"starving kids in Africa\" approach to it.

Such people live to pile drive a kid into puddles of fear and insecurity.  Your really strong response to her outrageous meanness and her overreach wasn\u2019t gentile but I\u2019m with you.  She was going after the kid you are protective of and she was a mean one.  It is also possible her behavior had an outlet because she knows her friend thinks little of your nephew.  He is the dog to be kicked and you are saying \u201cNot on my watch!\u201d  You were responding on s level of crudeness she recognizes.  \n\nGood for you!", "ESH. She shouldn't be calling a kid stupid and she sounds insufferable, but a simple \"you can't decide what my nephew can eat\" would suffice. Instead you immediately threw down, to me that makes you an asshole as well.", "ESH. Pal you definitely overreacted here, there was no need for the swearing and aggressiveness of your tone (I can sense it from here).

I would have just told to her to immediately GTFO. You did better than I would have.", "NTA. She had 0 right to worry about your nephew's food and if she wanted to inquire asking him if he was stupid was the least acceptable way to do so, especially because it sounds like nephew has enough other stuff on his plate without Grandma's friends essentially calling him stupid.

You could have used different words to get your point across.", "ESH - everyone is stupid here. Burritos don't have parsley, they have cilantro. Your mom's friend is awful for calling a kid stupid over their eating habits or any other reason really. You're stupid for turning the dial up to 69 on this argument.\n\nTake a deep breath dawg.", "YTA Because you were unnecessarily rude and mean and angry. You were right but you know what would have been the best response that didn't make you an asshole? \"Hey friend, nephew gets plenty of vitamins and he doesn't like parsley. As I'm currently his caregiver I say that it is okay for him to remove the part he doesn't want to eat, please respect that\"\n\nFriend is not TA for trying to make sure a kid eats well and learns manners (as picking apart food with your hands is generally considered gross and rude when you are an adult), she would only be an A if she forced him or pushed the issue with you after you said no. But it sounds like you got sassy and made dinner uncomfortable for everyone involved.\n\nEDIT: I'm not changing my judgement even after the edits bc that means she watched the parsley nudging THREE times before telling friend that kid was allowed to pick his food apart. If she wasn't okay with friend telling kid to eat the parsley, she needed to step in the FIRST time she saw her ask the kid. Because from the friend's perspective, the kid is ignoring her and being rude at the table, so she says it outloud, and then OP blows up on her after saying nothing the THREE other times she tried. OP handled this poorly.", "YTA for waaaaayyyy over-reacting in what you said. You could have said the same thing without \"unusual anger\" and telling her where the f\\*cking door was.

You were not right in how you said it.", "You should have  stayed  quiet or been respectful. You think  you're  some kind of guardian  because  you  \"protected \" your nephew  from....eating  Parsley.  This is what  we get for calling  every trivial stupid  thing  an accomplishment.

Hating cilantro is one of those things with has a real, scientific reason and isn't something to push on people because even close family members can have different genetic outcomes on this. Its pretty wild.\n\nAll of that aside, you are 100% correct in that this friend has no place telling your ward what to do.

And she can stfu. You were defending someone who is essentially your kid. Would I have worded it differently? Yes. But I wouldn\u2019t have been any more polite lol.

They started off extremely rude and earned the response, so NTA", "Maybe OP thinks cilantro is parsely?", "Yeah, sounds like a big overreaction to me", "she wasn\u2019t encouraging him at all she was telling him to like it wasn\u2019t a choice", "My guess is it was cilantro. Looks kind of similar to parsley, and some people really hate the taste. Parsley doesn't really taste like anything, and I've never heard of it going in a burrito.", "Well, she did force him. I forgot to include it in the post (sorry) but she nudged him 3 times on his shoulder pointing out the parsley on the table. As I said, I'm 95% of the times a very chill person.

I'm going to hope that's it. Because parsley in a burrito is verging on sacrilege.", "Cilantro has specific genetic markers which can cause people to have tremendously negative reactions to its flavor. It makes it essentially taste like soap. A lot of people have different genes and it doesn't have much flavor. A number of people taste both cilantro and parsley both strongly and positively. It's a wild scientific quirk about our genetics.", "But the way you handled it was so incorrect and put her on the defensive, belittling any true point you had. No need for it, all you had to say was \u2018my nephew is not stupid, leave him alone\u2019.", "So you are saying you watched her nudge him three separate times and didn't step in and then when she said something out loud you went nuclear? Y T A for letting her paster the kid that many times without stepping in. By seeing it happen and not correcting her the first time you saw, you allowed her to think the child was simply not listening and that she needed to say it outloud to be understood when in reality you weren't okay with her behavior at all. Then you blew up on her with from her perspective, no warning. Yeah, still TA.", "No, you call someone's kid stupid, you are going to get cussed out?", "I don't know how to explain this to you. She nudged him 3 times in a row when she was ending her sentence. My goal is not to change your opinion, just understand what I'm trying to say even if it takes 20 comments.\n\n\n\nI felt my body boiling the moment she said \"stupid\", I wasn't going to respond this much rude. Her nudging him was the killing blow for me. Yeah, I might be the AH in your, or everyone else's eyes, but I don't think most people would've reacted differently."]}
