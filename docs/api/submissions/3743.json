About 5-7 years ago, I had a pretty bad alcohol problem. It didn't harm my life that much other than having damaged a few interpersonal relationships, but I decided that I needed to address it. \n\nI've been going to multiple counselors for about a couple years now and have been significantly better, but a week before Thanksgiving, I had a bad relapse. I was supposed to go to a Thanksgiving dinner with my girlfriend at her parent's house. They're aware that I've struggled with alcohol in the past, yet they still would have served it and would have been drinking during the dinner, which is fine in principle, but it was a situation I personally wanted to avoid. \n\nI told my girlfriend and she was supportive of us just not going and staying in together. Her dad is pretty upset at me for it though and called me giving me an earful about how disrespectful it was to have cancelled such last minute, especially since he paid for us to fly out. I offered to repay him for the lost airfare, but he wasn't having it.   \n\n\nI don't have a traditional alcohol problem in that I'm always drinking and am unable to fulfill my obligations; in fact, I've done very well in my career so far. My problem is binge drinking when I do drink. Most of the time, I am able to control it, but this recent incident was just a really bad episode. Such things are very infrequent now, but they don't never happen. \n\nI feel bad about missing now because I think I probably would have been fine. I was just not mentally in a good place to want to have had to deal with it last week during Thanksgiving. Does this make me an asshole? Is her father right in that I should have gone? My girlfriend herself is very supportive of my decision to skip, which is what's making me very conflicted. I think I probably would have been fine; I was just super anxious about it which made me want to play it safe and skip.", "created_utc": 1669958266, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zachpw/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_girlfriends_familys/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sobriety trumps thanksgiving", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA.i think u approached the situation as best possible.you felt that u weren\u2019t well enough to be around alcohol again after u relapse so u remove urself from the situation instead of trying to make everyone around u not have alcohol and make them remove it from the house like I\u2019ve seen other people on here and you offered to repay him for the lane tickets so you did everything right to me.you might wanna do something nice for your girlfriend for staying to show u appreciate her staying with u instead of going to her family for thanksgiving", "How is it disrespectful to manage an legitimate disease? (And that's what we're talking about - crisis management.) No one should get a vote in that who isn't dealing with your crisis, after all. I admire that you gave yourself a boundary and respected it. Good on you. Its no repudiation or rejection of what they offered. It was just you managing a medical issue.\n\nNTA. Not at all. People who harass others about not drinking or being around alcohol have got some real unaddressed issues, IMO.", "NTA.  Sometimes you just have to prioritize your own well-being.  Maybe next year you\u2019ll be in a better, more confident place, but they\u2019re wrong to try to make you feel bad about this year.", "NTA!!\nAlso I want to add that there is no single \"traditional\" drinking type, I am sure you have learned about that in counseling. I would strongly suggest to go to some meetings. They are not only for cases where you have an urge to drink but you will talk to very nice and understanding people who might help you view the issues you are struggling with (in this case probably guilt) from another point of view.\nFIL is a dick. Ask yourself this: if you had broken your leg right before the trip would you have felt as guilty as you do now? Sure, you can feel a little bad but this is not on you. Rooting for you, OP, you can kick this!", "NTA your sobriety is the priority. I know her dad isn\u2019t having it but I don\u2019t care, you should repay the airfare. If he says he doesn\u2019t want it, send a gift card or something.", "NTA*\n\nIt's never a good thing to get between your SO and their family, but at the end of the day, you need to be the best version of yourself, not only for you but those around you. If that means missing a dinner? So be it. If your girlfriend supports you instead of her father, that's a good sign\n\n*Don't waste it. You've put tension between you and her family, and if you repeatedly do so, it will only cause more stress. You should do your best to get sober and make it up to them by being there next time, whether that's Christmas or some holiday next year.", "NTA.  Your girlfriend cares about you and your wellbeing.  Her dad is talking about \"disrespect\" and about the price of the airplane ticket; he's not thinking about you.\n\nThe person who knows best how you are feeling, is you.  Trust that.  Not wanting to go when you are in a vulnerable state, is just being smart.", "INFO: Did her family know you were cancelling because you relapsed? If not, what did you tell them?", "NTA", "NTA. You did the responsible thing and removed yourself from a situation that wasn\u2019t healthy for your resolve to abstain. I hope, with time to reconsider, her father realizes he grossly overreacted and accepts that you know better than him what you can tolerate.", "NAH. You do have a traditional alcohol problem. You did the right thing for yourself in this situation. It's understandable that your girlfriend's father was upset. That's a side effect of this disease. If he won't accept reimbursement then you might want to do whatever it takes to make sure you are in a good head space when your next opportunity arises to honor a commitment you have made to their family. Be it meetings, therapy or whatever it takes to prepare yourself in the weeks and days leading up to that commitment.", "NTA\n\nPay the man back for both tickets and apologize.\n\nAnd this statement isn't entirely accurate, 'I don't have a traditional alcohol problem in that I'm always drinking and am unable to fulfill my obligations'. You weren't able to meet your family obligations. It would have been nice for your gf to meet her obligation, but she got roped into cancelling with you, a very co-dependent behavior. \n\nIt was good to trust your gut about whether or not you should have attended. \n\nTake responsibility and make amends.", " It's understandable that you didn't want to go. It is ok to put yourself first. NTA. GF is TA though, she had no excuse to not go and she definitely had no reason to BLAME YOU to her family.", "\"It didn't harm my life that much other than...\"\n\n\"I don't have a traditional alcohol problem in that...\"\n\n\"Most of the time, I am able...\"\n\n**Dude. You're a drunk.** And you're a drunk who just happens to think he's not **that** drunk\u2014you know, the one who is a stereotype. \n\nYou're in denial\u2014and until you address that issue, you will keep having this problem. It will not go away on its own.", "If you\u2019re open with her family about your alcohol problem, it would\u2019ve been nice to tell them that you could only come if there wasn\u2019t alcohol.  That would have let them choose between having a dry evening (/weekend?) or you staying home.  Not that you have to be open with them - you get to choose who you tell about personal things like that, and when and how you deal with them.", "Honestly, I don't think that YTA, but I also don't think you're not a little bit of one. Your mentioned that you're problem is when you binge. You mention that it screwed up some relationships. Well, now I think you're screwing with other good relationships. \n\nYou should come first, but if you're family knows you have a problem, you can ask for their support instead of alienating everyone and wasting their resources to get you out there. \n\nI think it's lousy how it went down and I think that her parents are understandably upset. \n\nI am not an alcoholic, but I'm around plenty of them. So I can't say I fully relate. \n\nUnrelated to that, I have paid for plenty of trips that people didn't end up coming, and that's annoying. \n\nI'm all for looking out for your own health, but you've gotta take into consideration that your relationships and the health of those relationships is actually part of your overall health. Sometimes, you just gotta do shit you don't wanna do. If you've got peanut allergies, you say no to peanuts, even if they're delicious, you know there's a consequence to having even \"just one\". Well, you have consequences, even if you have \"just one\". I dunno, many that helps, maybe it doesn't. Like I said, I'm not an addict so I don't fully get it. I do understand consequences though. \n\nI guess another thought is that you're going to be an alcoholic for all of your life, if you avoid every social situation that's gonna be a rough life. \n\nIf you know you have a problem, you can own that problem instead of having it own you. \n\nI hope it all works out for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe he feels like you're taking her away from the family and is angry about that or maybe he is just one of those adults who never grew up and continues to react like a spoiled child every time he doesn't get his way.

Holy shit NTA. Sobriety is fucking tough in the beginning and you NEED to take care of yourself during this time. I\u2019ve been there. I was the same drinker as you. Not everyday, but 1 out of 4 times I would black out and get way too drunk and regret every fucking thing. It will get easy. Don\u2019t think youre missing out by not drinking. You build a life that doesnt NEED alcohol. It\u2019s actually a beautiful place to be and I can\u2019t believe I ever thought  alcohol made things more fun.\n\nIts a behavior to unlearn in social events, so of course you feel uneasy during a HOLIDAY after a RELAPSE. Shame on her family for knowing and still being upset. God fucking what is wrong with people.\n\nSorry for the tangent but if no one has said this lately: I\u2019m proud of you.

Being near something as tempting as Alcohol can be an issue, but an ultimatum is also wrong, and it seems the OP\u2019s GF\u2019s family isn\u2019t very nice and understanding about problems like that.

If I heard that my alcoholic brother had a relapse and Thanksgiving was coming up, my family wouldn\u2019t be drinking at Thanksgiving.

I\u2019m happy to come if it can be a dry event/weekend/etc, but I really can\u2019t come if there would be alcohol present.\n\nI\u2019m disabled with a condition that varies in terms of how it affects me, and sometimes I can\u2019t manage without my scooter.  When it\u2019s flared up, I check with my family to make sure that any plans take that into account.  If they\u2019ve planned to eat or stay somewhere that isn\u2019t accessible, I tell them that right now, I can\u2019t go unless we can change the plans to accommodate my wheels.\n\nLetting people who theoretically care about you have a choice to accommodate your needs rather than automatically staying away is perfectly normal and polite.", "Exactly. My parents removed alcohol for an entire year because my brother had alcohol problems and was moving back home", "I\u2019m glad you have that, and I hope if I ever suffer from that I will have that support too, and the same goes to everyone else on Reddit (the good ones) \n\nBut I said the GF\u2019s family wasn\u2019t supportive, which they obviously aren\u2019t, so I wonder if OP could have dinner with his own family?", "GF should have gone.

You got to face it some time.", "Nta staying sober is tough and instead off putting yourself in a position where u wasn't comfortable u avoided it people who never had an issue with alcohol don't understand the struggles of it sometimes. Your gf is a keeper thou for supporting your decision and sticking by u", "NTA! Addiction is a long battle, and you did what\u2019s best to continue winning that fight. I\u2019m sorry your gfs parents don\u2019t see it that way. I wish you luck on your journey!", "You are NTA. So many people believe that a little will power and elbow grease can get people through addiction, and mental health issues, and chronic pain, etc. There's no reasoning with them. They're like a baby who thinks you've disappeared when you cover your face. They can't see it, so it must not exist. \n\nYour girlfriend sounds like a wonderful partner. The reason she is unwavering on your side is because she gets it. Your health and recovery are the most important thing. No family event is worth a potential relapse. Addiction is tough. I wish you all the best.", "NTA but if you were my guest I would\u2019ve compromised and had no alcohol served (coming from a family of alcoholics)", "Yep. The family could have bought something festive but non alcoholic to drink and not made a big deal about it.", "Wtf are you talking about? OP was in a bad mental state and his girlfriend is supporting him by staying with him, instead of flying out and staying away for probably multiple days. And where the hell did you read that she turned her family against him?", "is putting your partner in a situation where they are dealing with your alcoholism that and then not allowing them to talk about it to family/friends not\u2026abusive? im the one failing to see how she \u201cturned her family against him\u201d by telling them the real reason they couldn\u2019t come.", "Oh, How you said makes sense, and is extremely polite but pushes that your boundaries are correct, and I agree with you, as I\u2019ve had to do stuff like that myself. I understand having to set boundaries, I was in a wheelchair-to-scooter for five years myself. \n\nHow the commenter made it seem was how I stated \u201ctake it away or I don\u2019t go\u201d. Impolite and unfair to those who want to see you but can\u2019t for their own circumstances. Thank you for helping me understand. Second language English person here, and tho I\u2019ve spoke it for a also five years (my injury was why we moved to America) some things still fly over my head."]}
