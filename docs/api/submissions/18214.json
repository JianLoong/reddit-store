{"id": 18214, "submission_id": "13scfym", "title": "AITA for dropping out of my cousin\u2019s wedding party after a prank?", "selftext": "throwaway \n\nMy (F26) cousin (F29) got engaged a few months ago and asked me to be a bridesmaid. I was so excited to accept! Her sister (F32) is the MOH and there are 3 other bridesmaids. The date is set for April 2024. \n\nOn April 1st of this year, she sent a PDF to the bridesmaid group chat that really made me angry. It was a list of wedding party responsibilities, rules, and regulations. It included a picture of the bridesmaid dresses that we\u2019d be wearing. They were hideous! And she told us that we\u2019d have to pay $800 for them and that they only went up to a size 8 so anyone bigger than that would need to lose weight before the wedding. That made me so angry because I wear a size 10 but also she\u2019s like a size 12 so even fatter than me!\n\nOther ridiculous things she added:\n* None of us were allowed to be tanner than her for the wedding so she told us that none of us could spend significant time in the sun for the next year. \n* She wanted to have longer hair than all of her BMs so she said that we\u2019d all have to cut our hair to our shoulders or shorter. \n* She wanted to do a choreographed dance with all of us and insisted that we go to 3-hour dance classes with her every Sunday until the wedding, a year away. \n* She said that she wanted her bachelorette party to be in Paris and that we would all need to chip in $3k. \n\nThere was more but I was so angry I stopped reading and muted the group chat for a few hours. I was so livid and hurt that I decided to drop out of the wedding party, but I didn\u2019t say anything right away. The next day I checked the group chat again and everyone else had been chatting about how funny the bride\u2019s \u201cprank\u201d was. Apparently at the bottom of the PDF it said \u201cApril Fools\u201d but I hadn\u2019t read that far because I was so mad. \n\nEveryone else thought it was hilarious but it still really rubbed me the wrong way. I reached out to the bride to tell her how much this hurt my feelings and she did apologize. But even though it\u2019s been almost two months I\u2019m still really angry. I decided this week that I no longer want to be a bridesmaid because of the mean-spirited prank and told my cousin. \n\nNow she\u2019s really hurt and angry, and the MOH, other BMs, and some of my family members are blowing up my phone saying that I\u2019m overreacting to an \u201cinnocent prank.\u201d But I believe that pranks are only funny if the recipient finds them funny, and I definitely didn\u2019t. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1685105594, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13scfym/aita_for_dropping_out_of_my_cousins_wedding_party/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't read it properly and leapt to righteous anger. A prank requires a trick is played on someone or it's not a prank. You didn't read to the end and therefore missed the part making it clear it was a prank.\n\nI would suggest you're pissed at yourself for falling for something with April Fools written on it...\n\nPerhaps speak to someone about your anger issues? Something so ridiculous is something to laugh at, not get angry at.", "YTA\n\nEven if it wasn't the best prank in the world, it still was an harmless prank: done on April's Fool, with a mention this is a prank in the document itself, no one specifically targeted, it was a group prank, etc., etc.\n\nYou didn't like the prank, that happens and it is fine by itself. But to hold two months after a grudge big enough you are dropping out of the wedding out of spite? That is some serious overeaction here. Especially for a group prank where you were not specifically targeted.", "YTA, ok I get initially you were angry, maybe you didn't realize the date.  You muted the conversation and still months later your still hanging on to it.  Your choice to drop out but a friendly suggestion... let it go, it was a relatively harmless prank.", "I could see taking this level of offense if you were the only one she sent this to and you felt targeted or singled out, but it sounds like she sent it to everyone.  I imagine you are harboring such hard feelings because you are ashamed you \"fell for it\" while everyone else was clearly more able to see it for the joke it was.  Talk these feelings out with a therapist who can help you understand and control your reactions to external stimuli.  You may have an issue decoding social cues.\n\nNot saying you're any sort of an AH, but your overreaction IS excessive in this case.", "I am sure the bride did not intend to hurt anyone and she even apologised for the prank. She cannot undo the prank now, so I am not sure what else you want from her? Do not make big decisions while you are angry it is a recipe for regrets.", "Let's see.  It's April 1st.  No property damage.  No money lost.  No public humiliation.  And you're still upset?  \n\nYTA", "Info: what made you so angry before you even finished reading?", "YTA all day.\nYou didn't even finish reading it... And you refuse to let it go after MONTHS??? \nI wouldn't want such a wet blanket in my wedding party fucking up my entire day, you were right to drop out.", "YTA. It was so outrageous that it was obviously a joke.", "YTA. You\u2019re butthurt because you didn\u2019t get the joke. Get over it. Your cousin would have a right to be hurt that you actually thought she would be this ludicrous and over the top as a bride, especially since there were clear signals like that she\u2019s literally a bigger dress size than an 8. . .and that it was April 1. It was pretty obvious and you\u2019re the only one who didn\u2019t get it. It was in good fun, not mean spirited, and you\u2019re just being a wet blanket.", "I was twitching when I read the word \u201cprank,\u201d bc usually on here \u201cpranks\u201d are code for \u201cbullying,\u201d but this one? Honestly, that\u2019s pretty good. I was actually chucking. And it said \u201cApril Fools\u201d right on the PDF?? She didn\u2019t let it go on for awhile? Cmon. You are ridiculous. YTA.", "YTA\n\nIt's an April Fools' Joke. It wasn't meant to hurt your feelings; however, it did and you told the bride and she apologized right away. Unless you think that her apology was fake, you are just holding a grudge for no reason.", "Yta she clearly made fun of her self as well, she wasn\u2019t signaling you out. Get a grip", "YTA. You definitely need some anger control and reactivity issues addressed with a professional. To have such anger and resentment for two months is not normal.\n\nWhen I read some of those \"rules\" I laughed - clearly they were jokes. I think what is going on is some deep jealously toward the wedding, maybe you are lonely, can't keep a partner, have substance abuse issues, etc. I don't know what, but I truly hope your reaction wasn't your personality - if so, you are going to have a long and hard road ahead of you.\n\nYou are definitely out of that wedding -- or at least I hope so. The embarrassment will soon sit in, and that will make you very aware of your actions. Even if you go back, it will be tainted. You're trying to justify your actions on reddit, clearly some part of you knows this was inappropriate and just mean. Either way, get help.", "YTA I\u2019m not into pranks, but this sounds very very innocent and actually is pretty funny in my opinion. It\u2019s also very clearly a joke. Why did this offend you? Even after knowing it was a joke? I think you\u2019re overreacting. You have the right to resign, but your response was over the top.", "YTA. \n\nThis was hardly even a prank. It was an innocent April fools joke. You are absolutely way over reacting. No harm was done. It was a silly over the top letter. It even stated at the bottom \"April Fool's Day\"", "Probably gonna be unpopular but YTA. When you said April 1rst I knew it was going to be a joke. When I saw the list of crazier than any crazy demands even seen here I knew it was a joke. To your own aval, you did not read it all, you just decided to be upset. Everybody else noticed it was a joke, the bride to be apologized because you took it the wrong way and yet you still are not happy. \n\n\nIf there is one day of the year where people make jokes, it's this day. But it makes me wonder: how well do you actually know her?", "There is nothing to be \u201churt\u201d about here. It may not be that funny but it\u2019s not mean spirited. You\u2019re overreacting, just step down and get over yourself.\n\nWhat specifically is she apologizing for?", "YTA. \n\nThe letter explained at the bottom it was an obvious prank and the bride to be apologized for it. All the other members of the bridal party picked up it was a prank and got over it; you're still angry over it  two months later? With all the ridiculous requests you should've been able to pick up it was all BS. \n\nStop being a AH, tell her you dropping out was a prank in response to her prank, hug and get over it. If she responds that she doesn't want you in it anymore you're right back to where you started anyways.", "YTA.  Most people are careful about Strange requests on April fools.    Everyone else caught on but you were slow on the uptake.    I think you are so angry because you are the only one that didn't even clue in that it was April fools day", "YTA. That was hilarious. Even if it wasn\u2019t for you, making yourself and your feelings the center of attention for her wedding, when she clearly indicated those requirements were a prank and even apologized to you for the misunderstanding, and you were a brides maid, is bad form to say the least.\n\nI think you need a few more years of life to become more mature about this sort of stuff and should just drop out of the wedding for the Bride\u2019s own good.", "YTA. Pranks aren\u2019t always funny but it wasn\u2019t personal and you also didn\u2019t read to the end so that\u2019s on you. You\u2019re obviously offended and it doesn\u2019t seem as though you\u2019re one to let things go (based on your outrage over this) so it\u2019s probably better for everyone if you drop out. I\u2019m saying YTA because in my view there are things to get upset about and things to shrug off. Yes the \u201cprank\u201d was outlandish but it was a prank. I\u2019d be more offended if the bride was serious.", "YTA. This isn\u2019t a prank that insulted or injured you in any way. Had you read to the bottom you could have laughed it off but your clearly one of those people that loves the drama and wants to make it bigger than it was. She apologized which is more than I would do it\u2019s not her fault you lack a sense of humour and are so sensitive. Way to piss off your family and cause a fracture over nothing", "YTA\n\nI mean, of course you can do whatever you wish, but it was so obvious it was a prank that I see no point in all this rage", "YTA You are behaving like a petulant child. Get over it.", "YTA.  Complete overreaction on your part.  Since it was a pdf in a group chat, it wasn\u2019t a direct prank on you.  So why take is so personally?  \n\nAnd you didn\u2019t even bother to read the whole thing.   You don\u2019t have to find it funny but can still recognize it was a joke.  So just let it go. The bride apologized. Why you\u2019re still bothered about it is beyond me.", "YTAF (You are the April Fool) and YTA\n\nThis was obviously a prank and an April Fools Day prank at that. Your cousin even apologized when you expressed that the joke upset you. The fact you're still holding on to anger about this situation for more than a few days let alone a few months indicates to me you either have some insecurities you really need to address or that you have a habit of making situations like this about yourself.", "YTA. I could understand initially getting upset but the bride was upfront enough with her prank and didn't try to keep the illusion going by giving it up at the end. (You just chose not to finish reading.) Then the bride realized you didn't find the prank funny, so she did the right thing and apologized, but you still decided to stay mad *months* after? Nah, you had enough chances for this situation to be smoothed over and both parties satisfied. At this point you're just holding an unnecessary grudge.", "YTA\n\nDear Lord, learn to take a joke. The fact it was sent on April 1st should have been your first clue. There was nothing in that that should have \u201churt your feelings\u201d, let alone enough for you to feel the need to drop out months later. \n\nAt least you dropped out now so your cousin can be surrounded by people who actually care about her and support her on her big day.", "Sorry, YTA. Response could of been \u201ceh,not that funny\u201d but should of not dropped out. Weddings are special, she picked you for a reason.", "YTA You should ask yourself why this pissed you off so much. I guess you had a problem with either being in the wedding party or the moh before, you even believed this right away.", "YTA.  It\u2019s a prank, you totally overreacted even going as far as calling the bride fatter than you ! You have anger issues and you should try and address that for your own benefit. You were excited to be part of your cousins wedding, can you get back that excitement or is your anger too great. It\u2019s such a shame to break a family relationship over the misreading of an April fools joke", "YTA. It was over the top, not directed to one person making them feel bad, funny and it was revealed quickly.", "Ehhh, I will go with YTA. The document even said its a joke.", "Yta, it was a prank that hurt no one, and she even apologized since you got your feelers in a twist about it so the least you could have done is drop out two months ago instead of holding a childish grudge for so long just to bring it up again.", "YTA.   That is funny.  You should probably drop out tho. Sounds like you are looking for any reason and will find another excuse anyway.", "Haha no that's funny YTA", "YTA for getting this upset over an April Fools day joke.  Do you not have a calendar?", "YTA. If you actually knew her well you probably wouldn\u2019t have needed to read the \u201cApril fools\u201d part to know it was a joke. Muting the chat as your first response is weird and kinda a red flag. If I were her, I wouldn\u2019t want you as my BM anymore.", "I was expecting a really horrible prank, but this one seems harmless. YTA for overreacting and not reading all the way.", "I\u2019m leaning towards Y T A but first INFO:\n\nWas your cousin\u2019s apology genuine? Or was it one of those \u201cI\u2019m sorry if you can\u2019t take a joke\u201d type of apologies?", "NAH\n\nThe prank was pretty cringe, but at least it wasn't the typical aith prank, which is just thinly veiled bullying.\n\nThe thing is, you're entitled to your feelings. If this prank and the subsequent fallout from it has made you no longer wish to be involved in this wedding, that's fine as far as I'm concerned.\n\nThe wedding isn't until next year, so any concerns about leaving them on the lurch aren't valid.\n\nI don't personally see what was so awful about this prank to warrant it myself. \n\nUltimately, I think a lot of people here are guilty of the same thing they're accusing OP of; responding emotionally and childishly. OP is allowed to change her mind for any reason. That should be respected.", "In the end, you can decide to do whatever you want. The wedding is 1 year away, you not participating shouldn't annoy anyone. It's your life, and you can do what you think is best. You're not ruining her wedding by not being a bridesmaid.\n\nFor them, it was a stupid prank, but you were annoyed enough. People are different. She should've thought that something could have happened. Not everyone likes pranks, and not everyone is ok to be made the butt of a joke even if it's April's 1. \n\nNTA", "I tend to react the same\u2026 I see a certain amount of bullshit, and I stop reading. I totally understand your reaction. Having to eat humble pie later is not easy. But if you really feel offended, no one has the right to belittle your feelings. Just do what feels right for you. Good luck", "ESH. You obviously and your cousin because she actually apologized for that lol", "[deleted]", "NTA. there's nothing funny about a joke like that and I would've dropped out too.", "NTA being a bridesmaid is not a contractual obligation. You can drop out whenever you want and the fact you are still angry says to me it\u2019s time to cut out. You might have taken the prank harder because it targeted things that you are insecure about. The costs and demands of being a bridesmaid can be a huge stress so I don\u2019t think joking about that is funny, and apparently neither do you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not even anything drawn out\u2026 it literally said it was a joke at the bottom of the list! It\u2019s probably best you step down anyway because this group will find you to be a buzzkill.", "Honestly YTA. It was april fools day. That was a harmless prank and i dont know what mean spirit you see in it. And it seems like it WAS a funny prank since everyone found it funny except you. The fact that you didnt know it was a prank is your own fault for not reading it. \nThese rules are so stupid that you either a) immeadietly know its a prank because its so ridicilous or b) you drop out because it is ridicilous. I seriously dont know how you could think she is serious. But getting mad to your extend is not normal. Espeically since you even get mad now by complaing about the dresses and the bride being \"fatter than you\". I also dont know why you are HURT. It was not a prank only directed to you, she didnt insult you, it wasnt personal and you were not kept in the dark. The fact that you are so mad months after if happend is so bizzare. You should drop out of the wedding since you cant seem to take the slightest bit of a joke or joy and weddings are usually a happy place.", "YTA\n\nI was ready for the typical AITA Carrie & pig\u2019s blood type of prank. Whether it\u2019s funny or not (which is both debatable and subjective), it was harmless and poking fun at bridezillas.

I wish I had thought of this when I was getting married. Why do you think it\u2019s \u201cmean spirited?\u201d It\u2019s a harmless joke, and kind of a stretch to even call it a prank tbh.", "YTA AND IMMATURE", "YTA. she was making fun of bridezillas not you. You silly sausage", "Judging if you\u2019re an A seems like the wrong thing to judge here.\n\nI hate pranks. I don\u2019t understand them or find them funny. I find them to be laughing *at* someone instead of *with* someone.\n\nComing from that mindset, the mindset of never enjoying pranks, this prank was clearly meant to be a mild prank. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d even call it a prank.\n\n- The date was April 1\n- The demands continued to escalate to an obviously extreme level, especially if they are atypical for the bride\n- The email ended by clearly stating this was a joke and that it was April Fool\u2019s Day\n\nThis sounds like a version of those \u201cfunny\u201d Facebook posts. It\u2019s meant for an immediate laugh or reaction. \n\nIt also sounds like this was meant to poke fun of bridezillas. The target wasn\u2019t the bridesmaids, it was the bride herself and how ridiculous/mean brides can be wielding their power.\n\nYour reaction doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s actually about this prank. You weren\u2019t specifically targeted. Your cousin apologized.\n\nAre you currently struggling with something? You mention weight and called both you and your cousin fat. Is weight a more sensitive topic than usual for you? \n\nPerhaps something else? Are you upset or embarrassed that you didn\u2019t catch on it was a joke or read the end? Is this part of a pattern of having a hard time understanding jokes or humor?\n\nWhether or not to be in the wedding is your call. There is plenty of time to drop out. However, I would strongly recommend taking a step back and thinking over your choice and why you want to make it. \n\nI don\u2019t think your reaction is actually about your cousin. Making it about her by dropping out of the wedding will permanently change your family dynamic. Be sure that\u2019s really necessary.\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t think who\u2019s the A is the real question here, but I will gently point out that YTA to yourself if you don\u2019t explore why this hit you so hard.", "YTA. It's a joke, get over it", "I struggled on this one. The thing that pushed it over the edge was that it included the fact that it was an April Fool's thing right in the doc itself.

Only assholes prank.", "I\u2019m saying NAH\n\ni dont think that what your cousin did was mean spirited, but that doesn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t hurt. i think you can accept an apology and understand it wasn\u2019t purposefully mean, but it still afffected you\n\na lot of other folks are jumping on the fact it was obviously a joke but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re hurt by it.\n\nyou have no obligation to be a bridesmaid, and they should respect that you want to pull out even if they think the reason is silly", "So angry to keep it up months later!!", "I dunno... I mean, I agree with YTA, but if this sub has proven anything to me, it's that there's no behavior that's so outrageous it's clearly a joke.", "That\u2019s my thing\u2014how well do you actually know her (and do you even like her????) if while reading that list of demands you couldn\u2019t tell it was a joke??

The bride made one asking OP to be in the bridal party but it rectified itself, thankfully.", "I think she should drop out. OP was part of a completely harmless april fools prank and is fuming over it months later.

Sure you don't need to find a prank funny, but why are you still mad at it 56 days later? (Assuming it was on April 1st) It was so non consequential why are you doing this to yourself and ruminating about it still?", "The cousin didnt have to apologize. OP shouldve read. People dont always have to apologize When they anger someone because sometimes, the angry person is the one in the wrong. Such anger and rage for literal months is not normal in any way.", "Agreed the wedding is a year away - the bride has lots of time to fill the spot or adjust as needed. \n\nI understand OP - pranks are only funny if the pranked doesn\u2019t mind, which is not the case here.  There maybe more pranks down the road and OP is making the right decision to guard her mental health.", "Why exactly is the bride TA for apologizing???", "It said April Fools' on the document. That should have clued OP in...", "This isn't an \"over the top\" prank. No one got injured, there was no property damage, and the bride was poking fun at herself and \"wedding culture\", not trying to scare or humiliate OP. Plus, she apologized, even though she hadn't done anything wrong.\n\nAn \"over the top\" \"prank\" would be like that horrible boyfriend who got into a full bathtub with red food dye so his girlfriend who had severe trauma around this issue, could find him.", "I would still go to the wedding btw! Have a chat before and hash it out. Bet she won\u2019t play any more pranks on you \ud83e\udee2", "wow you must be fun at parties\n\nno one was injured, no one sent any money, nothing happened at all. lighten up.", "She's pissed she's the only one who was too slow to realize it was a joke and made a fool of herself in the process.", "Yeah, I get it, might be pissed initially. Might dang, months later?\n\nYTA for sure.", "Especially related to a wedding.", "yeah, this was a rude and unnecessary comment on OPs part, she sounds like she's fun at parties.", "RIGHT! this is the source of the rage here,  not, not getting the joke.\n\nOP hates themselves and is bleeding all over her cousin.", "The bride isn\u2019t actually TA. I just lost brain cells reading that post and was astounded the bride actually apologized for a clearly innocent joke", "[deleted]", "She likely won't because OP will be rightfully ostracized for her pathetic nonsense.", "Be fair, that doesn't mean the prank was over the top, it means that you and OP have issues where you are quick to react to things without thinking it through.\n\nCognitive behavioural therapy is great for combating that, I really recommend it.", "...you should work on that. Such strong reactions for something like that arent normal."]}
