I aspire to your level of pettiness. I mean, if you are taking the job and can do the work (hell, maybe if even don\u2019t take the job), I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH - Oliver is an AH and the family was apparently fine with him treating you that way, so kudos. Seriously, well played.", "NTA his logic is so strange. \"You wouldnt be able to do this\" \\*you doing it\\* \"HEY, THATS NOT ALLOWED\"", "NTA, some people need real time demonstrations to show them how stupid they are.

Sounds like he was jealous of you to begin with putting you down all the time. Good for you for not taking it lying down. Your family is in the wrong to not back you", "Nta, he was a dick n no one said anything until u wanted to prove ur worth. I go NC with anyone on his side cause they r toxic, too.

Make sure you circle the compensation with your brightest high lighter when you rub it in his face. Hope you take the job and lord it over him for ages, leveling up again and again while he cries about how incompetent you are.", "NTA. Cousin needs to suck it up. He seems to be a little prickly pear that has been spoiled all his life. My question is, are you going to take the job?", "NTA. Your cousin deserved to get knocked down a few pegs. You should accept the job (if you want it of course).", "ESH. You're both acting petty and poking each other for the sole purpose of pissing the other one off. Why? Lay off each other for a while. You may also find that if you put all this competitive prodding behavior aside, you could *help* each other succeed since you're both in the same field.", "NTA and I\u2019m confused by all the ESH responses. The cousin sounds like he was being a dick with all the \u201cthis company would NEVER hire someone without a master\u2019s\u201d nonsense.\n\nI admire your ambition! And the cousin got served a nice slice of humble pie as well, which is always nice in these kinds of situations.", "NTA He went to great lengths to put you down and you proved him wrong. That he puts you down in front of family and they do not stop it, shows that you are the scape goat. When you prove to everyone that you have evidence that what he says is B.S, but they still put you down and make you the bad guy again shows you are well and truly the punching bag in that family. It maybe time to go N.C and amputate the toxic. You may have been driven to be petty, yes, but jealous, inferior and a bully? No.", "NTA but honestly, I hope to never hire people like you in the future, that demonstrates bad values and the will to impress people you don\u2019t even like for the wrong reason. That\u2019s not exactly stellar employee material. I just hope you actually enjoy the position. You could have accomplished way better in your own unique way but decided to copy cat him with a bonus to peacock.", "ESH- yep it\u2019s pretty petty and immature to make a big life decision based on proving a point to your cousin. Oliver should also keep his opinions to himself. If you let it be, time would of proven Oliver wrong but instead people are focusing on your petty move", "ESH. Oliver shouldn\u2019t be demeaning you and you shouldn\u2019t apply for a job you don\u2019t want just to prove a point. \n\nBoth of you, grow up!", "ESH your cousins a dick and you are one too especially if you never intended on taking the job that\u2019s super petty and you shouldn\u2019t let people get to you", "ESH, you are both beyond petty when you could actually be working together to advance yourselves \n\nAnd obviously he is worried you are going to fire him for the fun of it", "Jesus Christ, you all are in need of a break from each other.

He screwed around and found out.\n\nBut I\u2019d take the high road after this. Tell him him your are cousins not business rivals and you trust this will be the end of this. \n\nAnyone who gives you flak over this remind them they have not been around for every conversation and Oliver has done and put you down enough over the years.
