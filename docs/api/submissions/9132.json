I do software engineering management for a living and have been hiring for the past 16 years. To me, a masters degree in the same field as your bachelors is meaningless. I sat through enough dual listed bachelors/masters courses as a student to know what the difference was and it wasn\u2019t anything of value to me as a hiring manager or a coworker. A bachelors shows me that you made the commitment to complete a 4 year project successfully and will at least have some rounded edges. A PhD shows me that you extended that commitment to a program that expects a level of rigor that translates well into jobs that require analysis. A masters in the same field as your bachelors shows me that you were nervous about starting your career and weren\u2019t ready to leave school yet. A masters in a different field shows me you fulfilled the commitment to succeed but then decided at some point you wanted to take your life in a different direction \u2014 that\u2019s a choice and a will to grow.\n\nAgain, it varies by field. Some certifications, like teaching in many states, require it. Some might be safety critical and learning on the job doesn\u2019t fly so well. But in my experience, outside of those exceptions, you\u2019ll learn more practical knowledge of the field working with experienced people 8 hours a day than you will in a classroom a few hours a day.
