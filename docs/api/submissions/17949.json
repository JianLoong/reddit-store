Immediately after getting home from the hospital, my gf told me that he would be my responsibility when I was home since she would have to put up with him all day. I was pretty shocked but reluctantly agreed after she told me she wouldn't be doing it if I was home, so I didn't have a choice. \n\nHe's very fussy. He often needs to be held or rocked, and he rarely sleeps for more than an hour or two. I've been dealing with this for the last three months. I'd get off my job (I work construction), come home, and have to hold him so he doesn't cry. Often while trying to deal with dinner. Then I wouldn't get to sleep till about midnight, since that's when he has to be fed to minimize him waking up in the night. \n\nMeanwhile, my gf would sit back and watch a show or make herself something. She started going to bed by 10 and sleeping in the guest room since the baby sleeps in our room. For the last few months, I've been getting maybe 2 or 3 hours of sleep a night, then going to work and doing a physically demanding job. I was pretty much living off of coffee, snacks and energy drinks. Then coming home and dealing with the baby all night. I'll admit, I wasn't taking very good care of myself. I started forgetting stuff, even eating, my job performance was slipping. My gf just told me that that's what she deals with all day, so I guess i just felt bad and needed to keep stepping up.\n\nI collapsed at work on Thursday and woke up on the way to the hospital. The doctor told me I was basically exhausted and mildly dehydrated and told me to rest, stay home, and drink fluids for a week. Now, my gf is pissed and saying I don't do anything. I'm not even working. I feel bad still since the baby is a lot of work, but at the same time, I was literally told to take it easy. I don't do nothing, but nowhere near as much as I was. Like I'll sit and hold the baby, or feed him during the day, but I've started going to bed earlier and leaving her up with him. Or making her get up in the night. She keeps saying I'm not doing enough, and calling me lazy. I'm pretty lost at this point. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684791378, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13p476t/aita_for_refusing_to_help_while_on_bedrest/", "score": 207, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What kind of shit is that?\n\nThe way I see it, from 8-5, you're both working. You at your day job, her with the baby. When you're home, you split that time evenly between the both of you since you're both available. That way you both get a break and nobody collapses from exhaustion at work", "NTA wow! Listen I had a baby and I get it, but what your gf is doing is wrong. You can't be expected to work a physical demanding job then come home and keep going all night. No wonder you passed out!! \n\nWhen I had my son, my husband would help me when he got home from work so I could relax. But I got up at night since he had to work. And on weekends we split it so we could both rest. You're both going to be tired, that's life with a baby but no way should either one of you be exhausted to the point of being hospitalized.

In this time I would have a shower or cook dinner for us both as I needed a break from holding a baby, most of all I needed sleep so that I could take over from my husband and do the night shift alone as he had work the next day (and his is more a mentally demanding nor physically demanding job). If he had a job like yours, I would have been telling him to do less.\n\nDo you know whether your partner has gone to speak to someone? As it sounds like she potentially is dealing with a bit of post natal depression and it's getting on top of her. Not that her behaviour is acceptable, but I just wonder if there is more going on. I remember with my first I had to hold them 24/7 and I just felt so overwhelmed and out of my depth, I didn't feel like I was my own person anymore and I sometimes questioned whether I was doing a good enough job as a parent, I needed that reset every night my husband came home to be able to face the next day without crying.", "NTA.

She's killing you, and she doesnt give a fuck. If she wants this arrangement then she should also be working while you're home with the baby. She isn't.  You know how hard it is with taking care of the baby. If you did that all day while she was busting her ass with a physically demanding job, would you be making her do that when she got home? She's a stay at home mother.  If she doesn't like that arrangement then maybe it's time for the roles to be flipped. You stay home with the kid while she goes out to financially support the household. If I were you I would give her ass an allowance and go stay at a friend's or families house until she's willing to either talk about this bullshit, or you leave her ass.

She would be stuck doing it all on her own if something happened to you at work..  if you can afford a nanny at night so you both can sleep that would be good too. Sounds like she doesn't work so why she can't get up in the middle of the night I will never know. My husband and I took turns with our kids but when I worked more then he did house duties more and vice versa.

She's just handing the baby over at 5? Did she want the baby in the first place? Has she bonded with her baby? These are real questions that need to be talked about. I can't imagine what would happen if she'd had twins. \n\nI mean yes, a baby is hard but let's face it, we all do it. All the time. He's working a hard job, doing his part and to expect him to take over immediately is crazy. Share in duties is one thing but he's doing more than his part plus hers.", "Edit to add NTA.  Did your gf not want this baby? The following wording is concerning: \"she would have to put up with him all day\"...  So, your gf takes care of the baby while you are working, but not once you get home. If you work an 8-hour day, plus commute time, she is working maybe 10 out of 24 hours. You are working 24 out of 24 since you are responsible for the baby whenever you are not working, including during the night, by the way this reads. You should be splitting this 50/50 at most. Since she is caring for him while you are working, that time equals out. The part that needs to be split is the time that you are not at work. She should be taking care of him half of the remaining time after you get home from work and before you leave for work the next day.  Whether you split by days, hours, or specific duties, she needs to be doing 50% of the childcare when you are off of work. Who does the household chores? Are you splitting them or is she leaving them to you also?  How ever the regular household chores are being split, the childcare needs to be rearranged to make it more equitable for both of you. Your gf is not coming close to pulling her weight in the previous arrangement. The two of you need to redistribute the workload, or you might as well be a single parent. You, dear dad, are being used. This comes from a mother of four, not a man, so I am not being unfair due to gender.", "Jfc. People need to stop having babies if they don\u2019t have any intention of taking care of them. NTA", "NTA... wow she went to the other extreme. Yes you should be helping when you get home, but you need some sleep in order to be safe on the job. Maybe your shift should end at midnight.  Not sure what time you get up for work, but if you plan for 7 hours befor you leave the house for work. That's a minimum", "Nta. Time for the ol' swaperoo! Ask her to get a FT job, so you can stay home and take care of the baby all day, and she can come home and take care of the baby the rest of her day.

She will object of course, because she's incredibly selfish, and will think that's a horrible trade, and you can have a conversation on a more equal tradeoff from then on hopefully.", "It's time for them to figure out when she's going back to work and get the baby into daycare.

No, she hasn't. If this could be a sign of it though, I'll talk to her and see if she'll look into getting an appointment.", "Yeah, PPD was my immediate thought as well. It's a very bad sign for her to pretty much instantly say she doesn't care about this human being she just created, or for her to not care about *you* at all during this, either.\n\nFair warning: she will likely get pissed at the mere suggestion of getting help. Some people know they need it but need another person to give them the push; most people get defensive at the idea that there's something \"wrong\" with them. Be prepared for her to lash out and refuse, and please don't give up trying. Even if it's not PPD, this is not normal behavior.", "Anger and resentment can be a symptom."]}
