Immediately after getting home from the hospital, my gf told me that he would be my responsibility when I was home since she would have to put up with him all day. I was pretty shocked but reluctantly agreed after she told me she wouldn't be doing it if I was home, so I didn't have a choice. \n\nHe's very fussy. He often needs to be held or rocked, and he rarely sleeps for more than an hour or two. I've been dealing with this for the last three months. I'd get off my job (I work construction), come home, and have to hold him so he doesn't cry. Often while trying to deal with dinner. Then I wouldn't get to sleep till about midnight, since that's when he has to be fed to minimize him waking up in the night. \n\nMeanwhile, my gf would sit back and watch a show or make herself something. She started going to bed by 10 and sleeping in the guest room since the baby sleeps in our room. For the last few months, I've been getting maybe 2 or 3 hours of sleep a night, then going to work and doing a physically demanding job. I was pretty much living off of coffee, snacks and energy drinks. Then coming home and dealing with the baby all night. I'll admit, I wasn't taking very good care of myself. I started forgetting stuff, even eating, my job performance was slipping. My gf just told me that that's what she deals with all day, so I guess i just felt bad and needed to keep stepping up.\n\nI collapsed at work on Thursday and woke up on the way to the hospital. The doctor told me I was basically exhausted and mildly dehydrated and told me to rest, stay home, and drink fluids for a week. Now, my gf is pissed and saying I don't do anything. I'm not even working. I feel bad still since the baby is a lot of work, but at the same time, I was literally told to take it easy. I don't do nothing, but nowhere near as much as I was. Like I'll sit and hold the baby, or feed him during the day, but I've started going to bed earlier and leaving her up with him. Or making her get up in the night. She keeps saying I'm not doing enough, and calling me lazy. I'm pretty lost at this point. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684791378, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13p476t/aita_for_refusing_to_help_while_on_bedrest/", "score": 1798, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did your gf not want this baby? The following wording is concerning: \"she would have to put up with him all day\"...  So, your gf takes care of the baby while you are working, but not once you get home. If you work an 8-hour day, plus commute time, she is working maybe 10 out of 24 hours. You are working 24 out of 24 since you are responsible for the baby whenever you are not working, including during the night, by the way this reads. You should be splitting this 50/50 at most. Since she is caring for him while you are working, that time equals out. The part that needs to be split is the time that you are not at work. She should be taking care of him half of the remaining time after you get home from work and before you leave for work the next day.  Whether you split by days, hours, or specific duties, she needs to be doing 50% of the childcare when you are off of work. Who does the household chores? Are you splitting them or is she leaving them to you also?  How ever the regular household chores are being split, the childcare needs to be rearranged to make it more equitable for both of you. Your gf is not coming close to pulling her weight in the previous arrangement. The two of you need to redistribute the workload, or you might as well be a single parent. You, dear dad, are being used. This comes from a mother of four, not a man, so I am not being unfair due to gender.", "Jfc.

I think if she's off work she should be the one waking up with baby at night for the most part. This is a team effort. I get her wanting you to take baby in the evening after work so she can have a break every evening but sleeping in a different room and leaving all the night time care up to you when you have to work the next day is ridiculous. Your girlfriend is literally taking the baby for about 9 hours a day and you do everything else and go to work. The fact you had to go to the hospital because of this situation speaks volumes. I'm also concerned she doesn't even seem to care about your health..Honestly she sounds awfully mean ....", "NTA.

Your girlfriend seems to have unreasonable expectations of your duties.", "Okay, so you both work full time jobs, and she can't even be bothered to take care of HALF the care while you're home?\n\nBruh, I'm a SAHM and my husband works 12 hours a day. I handle all nights, and he handles at least an hour in the evening so I can decompress. Then we share time on his days off. There have been times where I've taken care of her for an entire week because my husband was extremely sick.\n\nWhat your girlfriend has asked is UNREASONABLE and SELFISH. Yes, postpartum sucks beyond hell, taking care of a baby is hard work, but working a physically demanding job like construction on little to no sleep is not only rough at best,  but DANGEROUS. She needs a reality check, and you need to consider if this is a relationship worth keeping, child or not. Having a child is the ultimate test of your relationship, and it sounds like this test has failed.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Wow your gf is selfish, yes a newborn is a lot of work but what she's doing is unacceptable.  You are working in construction, you need to be rested enough that you are cognizant of your surroundings, if not something even worse than your collapse could happen to you.  Does she not care if you are killed in a workplace accident, or even by falling asleep travelling to and from work.  The arrangement you have is not working and needs to be changed to take your safety into consideration. You need to listen to the Dr and look after yourself, what good will you be to your baby if you are no longer here.", "Jesus man.\n\nYou and your girlfriend need to learn to do maths.\n\nYeah, its not fair for her to do all the work for the newborn, but its also not fair for you to work a fulltime job AND do all the work for the child when you get home. Honestly you're not the first Dad who's been told to do it though.\n\nIts maths based on \"work effort\". Lets say looking after your newborn takes 16 hours per day. That doesn't mean 8 for you, and 8 for her, because it ignores you job. Instead, theres 16 hours of \"looking after newborn\" and for the sake of maths, call it 8 hours of \"job\". Thats 24 hours per day, you should be doing 12 hours each. So after your 8 hours at work, you should be doing another 4 hours of looking after the baby, and she should be doing 12 hours per day of looking after the baby. You've both put in 12 hours of \"work effort\" per day. \n\nCome the weekend (or whenever your days off are), that can look like 8 hours for her, and 8 for you. Or maybe its 12 and 4 again, but you switch it up, so one day you only do 4 hours and get a break, and the next she only does 4 and you do 12 so she can have a break. At this point its just a negotiation between you to figure out what works for both of you.", "Completely NTA. I was absolutely repulsed reading this post.

That\u2019s just to address the general situation. Right now while you\u2019re on bed rest, per DOCTORS ORDERS I\u2019d let her know that if she can\u2019t handle the household while you\u2019re down you\u2019ll unfortunately have to stay away for a few days.

Baby may be just as exhausted as you! I know when my youngest was that age, the little butthead would not sleep unless he was either in the swing or being held. When he was 2, we found out he is Hard of Hearing and all the things that normally soothed a baby to sleep- low music, hushed voices, dark room, etc- just served to freak him the heck out. We obviously hadn't known that but might have if we had pressed for additional testing when he was an infant. Our outcome is a way less common one, but they may find baby is struggling with reflux, not getting enough at meals, or any number of other issues. \n\nI would also STRONGLY encourage dragging your Gf in for a well-visit and letting the doc know in advance that you suspect she may be struggling with PPD. That is, unless her being this callous is normal for her, in which case I suggest a quality attorney. \n\nTl;dr- You deserve to be able to sleep. So: \n\n1. Call in your support network.

I breastfed or pumped, he'd do the bottle if the baby wasn't on the boob. My 2018 baby was very fussy and sensitive because he was colic. There's over the counter drops for this that help. Also, if he's drinking from a bottle, it could be giving him too much air. They make bottles specifically for colic, so less air bubbles get in. They helped our son so much!  I would check with his pediatrician to see if that's why he's so fussy. Or if he's on formula, it could be the wrong one.\n\n You need to take care of yourself, op. You can't do 100%, and you are. I'm sorry your girlfriend isn't handling being a mom the best right now. It definitely sounds a lot like PDD. When my kids were born, I was over the moon and kept them next to my bed in a bassinet, and i struggled with brutal PDD all 3 times... I was still waking up constantly to ensure they were breathing because I didn't trust the sids monitor to do its job. Her sleeping in another room wanting to be away from him during this crucial time is kind of a huge red flag. Her attitude is quite worrisome. She could also be traumatized from the birth experience. I've seen it happen with some moms. The birth goes so badly and traumatic that they don't even want to hold the baby. I really hope that's not the case and it went beautifully for her. If it is PDD, please know it's not her fault. The moment that baby comes out, women's serotonin levels and hormones drop super fast. We don't just get depressed because we don't like the baby. It's literally a chemical imbalance caused by giving birth, and it's really awful to go through. It takes a while to even out, or sometimes, medication helps it faster. \n\nI truly wish you both the best of luck. It's not easy, but it seriously goes so fast. I so wish mine were still that small.

See if you can afford a cleaning service to come in periodically to thoroughly clean the house, though that one is expensive. My point is to look at your duties, and see what can be put off or hired out for a little while. Anything that won't impact the safety of baby, or sanitary living conditions, let it go.
