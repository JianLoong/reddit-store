Your daughter only knows you are 'bothered by this' because you said something, otherwise she wouldnt know. There was no need for your wife to mention the abortion.

It sounds like theres a lot to your family dynamics here.", "Nah, they wanted the truth and didn't like what they heard, thats on them", "YTA. her life is not your life.   Her choices are not your choices.   A parents job is to love, teach and support.  As long as she's not harming herself or putting herself into a harmful position your opinion doesn't matter.   I know you had a vision and path for your children.  But she made her own path and now you're long for the ride.   You're a passenger and no longer the driver.   Accept that and move on.  By continuing this attitude you'll loose your daughter and grandson.", "NTA\n\nIf you actually said she was a disappointment, then you would be. \n\nA person shouldn\u2019t be upset for getting what they asked for and if you said it the way you say you did, that you were disappointed in her decision, that\u2019s a fair answer.\n\nAt the end of the day through, she\u2019s an adult and has to live her life how she wants, regardless of what you think. That doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t get an opinion though. \n\nI\u2019d be more concerned that your wife thinks you should have sugar coated it and expected you to lie or at least be dishonest about your feelings.", "Question:  Is your daughter *happy* being a wife and mother?\n\nI\u2019m going to say YTA, even though I can understand being disappointed. \n\nThat said, please keep in mind, that being a successful parent isn\u2019t about raising child to be who *you* want them to be, but raising them to be confident in who *they* want to be. If your daughter is happy, then that\u2019s all that matters.", "YTA it was an asshole thing to say in her presence.  As the diamond commercial says, \"Embrace the silence.\"  Yeah getting married 8 months into a relationship and having a kid at 18 while having no job is generally a recipe for disaster, but she didn't need to hear it.  You need to apologize to maintain the relationship and be there for her and your grandson when this explodes. \n\nI am sure someone will chime in with their story of how something similar happened and worked out fine.  To that person, you are the exception not the rule.", " While I agree that her having a child at 18 and depending on a man wasn\u2019t the smartest move, I must say you sound insufferable.\nFirst of all, referring to your grown daughters as \u201cso beautiful\u201d as their FATHER is SO weird and inappropriate. I don\u2019t even know what to say to that.\nSecond, your daughter made her bed a long time ago so now she has to lie in it, whether you like it or not. Your resentment is obsolete.

You have tunnel vision. People like you need to learn to stop demeaning the contributions stay at home parents make to society. Your daughter and her husband had to grow up fast and have taken responsibility for themselves and their family. A lot of families have to make the hard decision for one parent to stay home because of the exorbitant cost of full time day care. You really need to get a grasp of the realities young people, couples and families face these days. Most of them wonder if, not when, they will be able to afford to purchase a home. You are fixated on what what you wanted not what your daughter has achieved.", "YTA. \nYou know those words will stay with her forever don\u2019t you.", "YTA - Your answer comes off as \"I love my grandson but will never get over how he was conceived.\" You are entitled to your feelings but she is also entitled to react negatively to your feelings. Your inability to get over this is damaging your relationship with your daughter her family.", "YTA. She didn't ask any of that, you just had to blurt it out anyway.", "YTA. It sounds like you\u2019ve been very vocal about what your daughter has done that has disappointed you, but what\u2019s done is done. You could have used this question to highlight things about her that impress you, maybe how she\u2019s a caring mother. What\u2019s the point of her knowing you will always be disappointed with her?\n\nIf you feel compelled to voice this, maybe you should soften it. \u201cI worry about you because you weren\u2019t able to start a career or attend school\u201d shows caring and concern, without using guilt to make her feel like garbage.\n\nGet over it and love your daughter, or let her know you\u2019ll always be disappointed (so she can decide how much she wants to be around you).", "NTA. It\u2019s very understandable that you feel the way you do. And you have a point.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly dangerous for women to be dependant on men. The path your daughter has chosen leaves her in a vulnerable position where she won\u2019t be a fully autonomous human being. Her husband will always have a say over her, even if it\u2019s unconscious for all involved.\n\nYou wanted what\u2019s best for your daughter: her being able to live a safe life. That life isn\u2019t possible if she is financially dependent on her husband.\n\nYou also didn\u2019t call her a disappointment, you called the circumstances surrounding her situation disappointing. While making it explicitly clear that you love your grandson and don\u2019t resent him or her.\n\nThe only thing you can do is be there for her if things go south. And hope she has the ability to leave if she ever needs to. Many women won\u2019t be able to take that step.

Be excited about your growing family and a better father.", "YTA - it\u2019s her life not yours and you\u2019re awful for placing your disappointment on her. \n\nShe got pregnant and you know what, she took those consequences of her actions and handled it how she wanted to. She\u2019s making a life for herself. Just because it\u2019s not the life you wanted her to have if she is happy that is ALL that matters. Her overall happiness be it as a mother, a lawyer or a stripper is all which should matter to you. \n\nWe raise our kids to make their own choices and to live a life which hopefully is happy.

Maybe you didn\u2019t word for word tell her you love her less or that you don\u2019t love her child, but everything else you\u2019ve said and done has made her believe that.\n\nAnd when you had an opportunity to prove to her that you love her child, you drag out your disappointment all over again.\n\nHow long do you plan on punishing her?", "YTA\n\nYou never tell your wean you're disappointed in them.\n\nYou could easily have said you were sad about her situation because it's not what you wanted for her, you still care about her and love your grandson but you just hope as the wean gets older she goes back to school or gets a job so she's not totally reliant on her husband.", "YTA on every level. Seriously, why would you say that to your daughter? The only disappointment here is you\n\nYou sucked for trying to pressure an adult to get an abortion and you really need to move on from her not doing what you told her to. Her body, her choice", "NTA\n\nBut you could have phrased some of it that better. \n\nAll of my kids knew from when they were teens that I\u2019d be disappointed in them if they ever got or got someone pregnant. I think most parents would. And I think most teens know this also. \nSo that really shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise to your d. \n\nNow, about her staying home-\n\nThere can be diff reasons for this, have you asked her why she decided to stay home? \n\nIs it that her h makes enough money that she can? Maybe she feels that she wants to be the one to raise her child, maybe she\u2019s just paranoid about leaving the baby with anyone, maybe she thinks because she doesn\u2019t have a degree she feels like her paycheck would either fully or not even cover the cost of daycare, so why bother being away from her child all day for really no net monetary gain. \n\nAll of those are legitimate reasons for her to stay home, or she doesn\u2019t even need to justify it. It is what works for her family. \n\nYou say you didn\u2019t want your d financially dependent on a man, but what\u2019s her alternative? Have a job while also raising the kids? Yea of course she has her h to split the childcare with, but let\u2019s not kid ourselves, it\u2019s still hard, on both parents. Daycare schedules, then school, then after school activities, and who takes off when the child is sick,  what to do with them all summer and holidays?  \nWhy would you want your d to have to deal with all of that? \n\nWere you going to quit your job to watch that child every day for 10 hours? \n\nI stayed home with my kids. I didn\u2019t feel dependent on a man, we as a couple were building our life and our family as we saw fit- together as a team. \n\nMaybe your d and her h see it the same way.", "NTA: I'll be the odd one out. You Qantas what's best for your daughter and I can't blame you especially with divorce rates are now a days. You gave her the answer she would want to hear and then when asked for the honest truth you gave it to her. Don't ask if you don't want the real answers.", "There is NOTHING wrong with her choices, especially if she\u2019s happy. Plus, she\u2019s still young she has all the time to change her mind and get a degree or start working if she wants to. YTA.", "NTA\nIts not like you gave your opinions unsolicited. She asked for an honest answer and I think it's important that you maintained your integrity because even though she may not have liked your answer, she knows she will get honesty from you (again, I want to emphasize that I hate the \"brutally honest\" type people but what makes you different is that you didn't spout your opinions unasked). And you're right. It's not ideal for her to be completely dependent on a man like that.", "YTA because your \"honest\" answer wasn't even what she asked.

She is a young mother, and good for her. Do you think she will be a young mother with a young child forever? That she cannot -- if she wants -- pursue additional interests now or later? Did you think of the advantages of young motherhood? She has the energy to be an engaged mom now, and in 15 or 20 years will still be. young enough to finish university, if she wants, and have a career, if she wants.

She's 23 not 7, don't ask a question you don't want an answer to.\n\nI'm sorry but I thought you answer was honest, realistic and kind. You admitted to being happy with you grandson and loving him, but you can't lie and say you're necessarily happy with all your kid's decisions. \n\nI'm sorry but not being ecstatic that your child, has no education or job experience and is completely dependent on their spouse isn't a terrible thing, it's not a dig at SAHM or motherhood,  it's just worry/fear that if anything happens his kid/his grandkid will have massive financial issues. \n\nYou didn't say she herself was a disappointment, if you had I would be reeming you out in the comments myself.  When she committed to this new life plan, You put you thoughts aside and supported you kid despite your own feelings, which is what parenting his, parents don't have to be necesarily happy with their kids choices they do have to support them though, and you did. \n\nMy mom a teen parent and she's amazing, my parents made it work and everything worked out, but that doesn't mean they wouldn't be disappointed if after all their sacrifices I had followed the same path, and again this isn't a dig at teen moms, it's just acknowledging that being a teen parent is a huge struggle and realistically no parent is going to be ecstatic about their kids having children so young.  I fully support anyone's decisions but if my little brother came up to me and said he was dropping out if school and his high school girlfriend was pregnant, disappointed wouldn't even cover my feelings. \n\nWe all know our parent and their beliefs/wants and we know if we deviate if might disappoint them, the question is how our parents handle that/treat us. Parents are allowed to having thoughts and feelings, as long as they don't push them on thir kids that's fine. OP doesn't like certain things but didn't voice it, didn't push it on his kid. he just quietly accepted her choices once they were made and supported her. As his daughter she knew his feelings but she can't be upset because at no point did he push them on.\n\nNTA", "YTA.

She remains dependent on people.  If she gave birth and remained in school, then she would be gaining skills necessary to be independent and have options.  She can remain a homemaker if that is her choice at that point, but right now she likely cannot get a job that pays more than daycare leading to a lack of choices.
