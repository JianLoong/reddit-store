They are both so beautiful and smart and I really love them both.

My younger is still playing in a team and also studying at a good university. She is really hardworking and even if she does not succeed in playing professional volleyball, she will definitely have a good job.\n\nMy older daughter quit both sports and school when she got pregnant at the age of 18. When she first told us that she was pregnant, I was very upset and advised her to have an abortion because having a child at such a young age would disrupt her life. She did not want to have an abortion and my wife supported her decision. To be honest, I was very insistent on her having an abortion at that time, but when I saw that she remained determined, I dropped the issue and supported her fully, even though I didn't want to.\n\nShe got married quickly with the baby's father. Then she decided to stay at home and take care of her child and her husband started to work. I never wanted my daughter to be financially dependent on her husband, but I never voiced it either. But of course, my daughter know that I'm bothered by this.\n\nYesterday we were having dinner with my daughters and my wife. My wife and daughter started talking about being a mother. My wife told her that even though I wanted her to have an abortion, I love my grandson very much now. My daughter asked me if that was so, and I said, \"Of course I love him.\" I really love my grandson, but my daughter knew that I was bothered by her situation, so it didn't sound sincere at all.\n\nMy daughter said I could give an honest answer. I told her that I really love my grandson but that I was disappointed that she had become a mother at an early age, had left school and her job and was now dependent on a man. She didn't argue with me but the rest of the night was a bit tense.\n\nAt the end of the night she went home and my wife started a fight over what I said. I told her that she was the one who wanted an honest answer, but my wife is sure that I'm an AH. My younger one agrees with me but says I was rude to say it out loud.\n\nEdit:\n\nI'm not sorry that my daughter doesn't live the life I want, I'm sorry that she lives dependent on another person, and I can't say that their marriage is going very well.\n\nThey chose the sport they wanted to be interested in, the university they wanted to go or their hobbies etc. I didn't force anything on them. All I want is for them to be self-sufficient.\n\nI also told my daughter that I would pay for a babysitter if she wanted to go back to school or get a job.

Your daughter only knows you are 'bothered by this' because you said something, otherwise she wouldnt know. There was no need for your wife to mention the abortion.

Her choices are not your choices.   A parents job is to love, teach and support.  As long as she's not harming herself or putting herself into a harmful position your opinion doesn't matter.   I know you had a vision and path for your children.  But she made her own path and now you're long for the ride.   You're a passenger and no longer the driver.   Accept that and move on.

That doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t get an opinion though. \n\nI\u2019d be more concerned that your wife thinks you should have sugar coated it and expected you to lie or at least be dishonest about your feelings.", "Question:  Is your daughter *happy* being a wife and mother?\n\nI\u2019m going to say YTA, even though I can understand being disappointed. \n\nThat said, please keep in mind, that being a successful parent isn\u2019t about raising child to be who *you* want them to be, but raising them to be confident in who *they* want to be.

As the diamond commercial says, \"Embrace the silence.\"  Yeah getting married 8 months into a relationship and having a kid at 18 while having no job is generally a recipe for disaster, but she didn't need to hear it.  You need to apologize to maintain the relationship and be there for her and your grandson when this explodes. \n\nI am sure someone will chime in with their story of how something similar happened and worked out fine.  To that person, you are the exception not the rule.", " While I agree that her having a child at 18 and depending on a man wasn\u2019t the smartest move, I must say you sound insufferable.\nFirst of all, referring to your grown daughters as \u201cso beautiful\u201d as their FATHER is SO weird and inappropriate. I don\u2019t even know what to say to that.\nSecond, your daughter made her bed a long time ago so now she has to lie in it, whether you like it or not. Your resentment is obsolete.

You have tunnel vision. People like you need to learn to stop demeaning the contributions stay at home parents make to society. Your daughter and her husband had to grow up fast and have taken responsibility for themselves and their family. A lot of families have to make the hard decision for one parent to stay home because of the exorbitant cost of full time day care. You really need to get a grasp of the realities young people, couples and families face these days. Most of them wonder if, not when, they will be able to afford to purchase a home.

Your inability to get over this is damaging your relationship with your daughter her family.", "YTA. She didn't ask any of that, you just had to blurt it out anyway.", "YTA. It sounds like you\u2019ve been very vocal about what your daughter has done that has disappointed you, but what\u2019s done is done. You could have used this question to highlight things about her that impress you, maybe how she\u2019s a caring mother. What\u2019s the point of her knowing you will always be disappointed with her?\n\nIf you feel compelled to voice this, maybe you should soften it. \u201cI worry about you because you weren\u2019t able to start a career or attend school\u201d shows caring and concern, without using guilt to make her feel like garbage.\n\nGet over it and love your daughter, or let her know you\u2019ll always be disappointed (so she can decide how much she wants to be around you).", "NTA. It\u2019s very understandable that you feel the way you do. And you have a point.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly dangerous for women to be dependant on men. The path your daughter has chosen leaves her in a vulnerable position where she won\u2019t be a fully autonomous human being. Her husband will always have a say over her, even if it\u2019s unconscious for all involved.\n\nYou wanted what\u2019s best for your daughter: her being able to live a safe life. That life isn\u2019t possible if she is financially dependent on her husband.\n\nYou also didn\u2019t call her a disappointment, you called the circumstances surrounding her situation disappointing. While making it explicitly clear that you love your grandson and don\u2019t resent him or her.\n\nThe only thing you can do is be there for her if things go south. And hope she has the ability to leave if she ever needs to. Many women won\u2019t be able to take that step.

Be excited about your growing family and a better father.", "YTA - it\u2019s her life not yours and you\u2019re awful for placing your disappointment on her. \n\nShe got pregnant and you know what, she took those consequences of her actions and handled it how she wanted to. She\u2019s making a life for herself. Just because it\u2019s not the life you wanted her to have if she is happy that is ALL that matters. Her overall happiness be it as a mother, a lawyer or a stripper is all which should matter to you. \n\nWe raise our kids to make their own choices and to live a life which hopefully is happy.

Maybe you didn\u2019t word for word tell her you love her less or that you don\u2019t love her child, but everything else you\u2019ve said and done has made her believe that.\n\nAnd when you had an opportunity to prove to her that you love her child, you drag out your disappointment all over again.\n\nHow long do you plan on punishing her?", "YTA\n\nYou never tell your wean you're disappointed in them.\n\nYou could easily have said you were sad about her situation because it's not what you wanted for her, you still care about her and love your grandson but you just hope as the wean gets older she goes back to school or gets a job so she's not totally reliant on her husband.", "YTA on every level. Seriously, why would you say that to your daughter? The only disappointment here is you\n\nYou sucked for trying to pressure an adult to get an abortion and you really need to move on from her not doing what you told her to. Her body, her choice", "NTA\n\nBut you could have phrased some of it that better. \n\nAll of my kids knew from when they were teens that I\u2019d be disappointed in them if they ever got or got someone pregnant. I think most parents would. And I think most teens know this also. \nSo that really shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise to your d. \n\nNow, about her staying home-\n\nThere can be diff reasons for this, have you asked her why she decided to stay home? \n\nIs it that her h makes enough money that she can? Maybe she feels that she wants to be the one to raise her child, maybe she\u2019s just paranoid about leaving the baby with anyone, maybe she thinks because she doesn\u2019t have a degree she feels like her paycheck would either fully or not even cover the cost of daycare, so why bother being away from her child all day for really no net monetary gain. \n\nAll of those are legitimate reasons for her to stay home, or she doesn\u2019t even need to justify it. It is what works for her family. \n\nYou say you didn\u2019t want your d financially dependent on a man, but what\u2019s her alternative? Have a job while also raising the kids? Yea of course she has her h to split the childcare with, but let\u2019s not kid ourselves, it\u2019s still hard, on both parents. Daycare schedules, then school, then after school activities, and who takes off when the child is sick,  what to do with them all summer and holidays?  \nWhy would you want your d to have to deal with all of that? \n\nWere you going to quit your job to watch that child every day for 10 hours? \n\nI stayed home with my kids. I didn\u2019t feel dependent on a man, we as a couple were building our life and our family as we saw fit- together as a team. \n\nMaybe your d and her h see it the same way.", "NTA: I'll be the odd one out. You Qantas what's best for your daughter and I can't blame you especially with divorce rates are now a days.

Don't ask if you don't want the real answers.", "There is NOTHING wrong with her choices, especially if she\u2019s happy.

She is a young mother, and good for her. Do you think she will be a young mother with a young child forever? That she cannot -- if she wants -- pursue additional interests now or later? Did you think of the advantages of young motherhood? She has the energy to be an engaged mom now, and in 15 or 20 years will still be. young enough to finish university, if she wants, and have a career, if she wants.

Families where two parents have the skills/education to bring in a good income are much more financially secure even if one parent stays home.\n\nSecond, it's much easier for a 18 year old girl to get through college or university than it is for a SAHM juggling one or more kids.

Being disappointed in the situation is natural as a parent. Still harping on it FIVE YEARS later is why YTA.", "Can you say more about how you supported her? Did you tell her you were proud of her for the life she\u2019s building? That you would always love her and her child? That you recognize that she\u2019s an adult who can make her own decisions, and that you respect her right to do so? That you understand that what you might have envisioned for her life doesn\u2019t matter compared to what she actually wants?", "Yes it is honesty because he explains where reservation came from in the first place. The way your framing it makes it impossible to ever be honest and having multiple layers to it.", "she questioned his honesty because of his demeanor, so he explained the reason for his demeanor. She wasn't just putting in question his feelings towards his grandson, she was also questioning his motives to sound insincere.", "Bullshit examples, be honest but not really because I can't take honesty.", "Your examples are goddamn bullshit and you know it. Theres a world of difference between you're too fat for that dress and I'm here to support you and care for you but can also be disappointed. \n\nNot only was OP honest he was, indeed, incredibly tactful about it. Literally accepted her choices and accepts her as she is while giving her all the support he can financially and emotionally. \n\nAnd besides that, shouldn't a good and honest relationship between adults be mature enough to understand that maybe, just maybe, you are too fat for that dress? That's also touted around here. \n\nSo which is it? Do we be honest and tactful, honest and brutal, or lie? Because based on these comments it's damned if you do regardless of which option you pick.\n\nAnd the ones spouting off abuse can get fucked even more.", "She asked and he replied. I cannot find any fault in OP for saying what he said. If I gave up my education and career and become dependent on someone else for money my parents would be mad disappointed in me. They spent a lot of money on my schooling and I could never insult them by throwing it all away.", "Clearly he's really not. Mom/wife must be since she brought it up. Like what was the need for Mom to make that comment, especially given baby is 4.", "I told her I would always love her and her child. - That was truth.\n\nI said I respected her decisions. - That was a lie.\n\nI said that what I envisioned for her life was less important than what she wanted. - That was a lie, also the only thing I envisioned for her life was to be an independent woman.\n\n1 - I lied because I didn't want her to be upset.\n\n2 - I think the opposite of my lies because I care about her.\n\nI was also with her at every hospital check-up, I often visited her, called her, asked her how she was doing, talked to her, calmed her down in times of stress."]}
