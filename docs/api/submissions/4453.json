She made arrangements and booked flights a few months ago and we discussed it in passing over video call. \n\nDuring a recent visit, the day before she returned home, she mentioned that she was staying for three weeks. I was taken aback by this, I thought it would only be 1.5-2 weeks. I don't doubt that she had told me the dates, but I'm sure I would've remembered if she had said three weeks. That's a long time to expect to stay with someone.\n\nI discussed this with my partner and we both concluded three weeks is too long. Christmas is a stressful time, we have family visiting from another city and overseas, and Kate and Chris have no transport so therefore rely on us to drive them places. We also have a very skittish and anxious cat who is usually allowed outside, but the vet advised us to keep him inside in case he runs away. Three weeks is a long time for him to be hiding under the bed.\n\nI decided to send Kate a message (17th Nov) asking if she was going to stay with her family at all over Christmas. I explained that three weeks is a long time, I'm totally happy if she stays for part of the time, and I hoped we could figure something out. I apologised and said that there must've been some sort of miscommunication.\n\nWhat followed was messages back and forth about how I fucked her over, ruined her plans, don't care about her, and wouldn't do the same for her as she would for me. She called me an asshole, a piece of shit, and said I had the flight details and that she wasn't going to hold my hand and explain it to me like a child. She said I was acting oblivious and was well aware of how long they were staying, and that we talked about the dates multiple times. She'll have to spend her first Christmas back in her home country alone.\n\nProblem is, looking back, I did have a screenshot of the flight details and she was here for exactly 14 days. Except, she said she was telling people three weeks because it was \"easier than saying two weeks and a few days\". But it was 14 days. Why would she tell me three weeks and also not correct me after the first message? \n\nTwo weeks would've been perfectly fine, I only brought it up because I thought she was staying for three weeks, and now it has ruined a 16 year long friendship.\n\nI feel awful about this whole thing. When she said three weeks, I panicked and didn't think to double check the dates. Now I have to grieve the loss of a friend who thinks I'm selfish and careless.", "created_utc": 1670751894, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zimei1/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_and_her_fianc\u00e9/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m failing to see what you\u2019ve done wrong.", "NTA\n\nYour friend sounds so exhausting...\n\nCancel any plans and think about this friendship", "I\u2019m not sure I understand completely. Was the initial and OFFICIAL plan, and the flight details she sent you, 14 days? \n\nThen NTA. She changed it without telling you and that\u2019s completely out of line. \n\nIf you had the dates, and they were for three weeks, then you were careless and that wouldn\u2019t be cool. Then again, you\u2019re allowed to change your mind and she would just have to accept that. \n\nWhatever the situation was, she overreacted. Insanely. Is there something else going on with her maybe?", "NTA:\n\nYou had her flight details. Details said 2 weeks. 14 days. Not three weeks. You're entitled to having your home and you actually gently probed on whether or not she was staying else where when you questioned it. Where did the other week come into factor?\n\nTo me, and my personal opinion, is she's using you as a free vacation resort and when you didnt just lie down and allow her to do it, she showed her true colors, yes even after 16 years. You didn't ruin anything, she ruined it by feeling entitled to your time and your home during a busy season generally for everyone. \n\nYou're not selfish and careless. Selfish and careless would have told her that she had to find a hotel room during her 14 day visit, instead you offered her your home. You did nothing wrong. She imploded your friendship on her own terms.", "NTA.  Your friend became totally unhinged due to an innocent miscommunication.  She mistakenly said 3 weeks when it was only 2 - which should have been easy to correct.  But rather than just clarify the length of her visit, she went nuclear with personal attacks.  She was downright abusive.  I would never be comfortable hosting her after such a viscous attack.\n\nClaiming that she would do more for you than you do for her is so hypocritical since she couldn\u2019t even be bothered to iron out a small misunderstanding.  Her rant makes me wonder if she planned to ask for a REALLY big favor during her visit.\n\nHas she ever flown off the handle like that before?  Sudden and drastic personality changes can be a symptom of a medical problem.", "NTA you have proof that it was 2 weeks and your BF is so disrespectful to you by calling you names and swearing at you. Throw it back at her with the screenshot and get rid of this awful person from your life.", "NTA. 14 days IS two weeks. It is not two weeks and a few days? Can she not count or what- I really don\u2019t get it.", "NTA- you were willing to compromise and she flew off the handle for not correcting you? \n\nYou have a memory problem but she has an over dramatic AH issue.\n\nEdit: I wasn\u2019t trying to be rude about the memory problem. I have ADHD so I was giving you credit because it\u2019s not our fault lol", "NTA she sounds exhausting\u2026", "Three weeks?! Seriously, was she planning to ever leave, or was the idea to claim tenancy? Even two weeks seems excessive. You are absolutely nta.", "NTA. She tried to change plans last minute, during the holidays. You weren\u2019t a doormat, and she didn\u2019t like that. She can reflect on why she\u2019s spending Christmas alone (maybe entitlement & lack of empathy).", "Send a message to her outlining everything.

As I stated it is not feasible for us to host you for that length of time. \n\nThe attached screenshot of your flights show you staying for exactly 14 days. Which is the length of time we all agreed on. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why there is a 7 day discrepancy in your stated plans vs flights, but we look forward to seeing you from X-Y date.

To stay with someone 3 weeks at christmas time is lot to ask, even two weeks. Please, don't let them come at all after this reaction. Instead looking for their own mistake they insulted you and treated you like shit. I bet just so that you give in for their three weeks. And then it will be four... and oh, the flight is canceled, we stay another week...", "Not sure if I've misunderstood but 14 days is two weeks.", "Agree with the soft YTA...it hinges on communication. Rather than texting give her a call and see if you can't patch this up. That's a lot of friendship to throw away over a misunderstanding.

I would never expect my friend to keep me for 3 weeks when home for a visit. It\u2019s too much. She\u2019s also been really rude by saying you\u2019ve fucked her over. Sounds like a bit of a drama queen.", "NTA. She could have easily corrected herself and said \"the ticket says 2 weeks, my mistake\", crisis averted. She must have changed her ticket. \n\nOnce the insults started flying, the hosting offer should have gone from 2 weeks to 0 weeks.\n\nThere's something very sketchy going on, and it makes me wonder if she was planning on staying even longer than 3 weeks. If you have the trip id, can you check if the details of the original ticket have been changed?", "NTA. You can just say OK so of course I though it was originally two weeks per your screen shot and our discussions then when you started saying three weeks I thought it got extended without informing me\u2026etc.   she went way overboard with her response", "YTA for not looking at the dates when she set it up AND when you asked her to change them.", "YTA, even if it had been three weeks, you should not have tried to rescind once the flights were booked to the dates you agreed. At that point, it\u2019s time to suck it up, be a good host, and remind yourself to check the dates more closely next time. \n\nAlso , never try to have a tricky conversation like this over text, you\u2019re just asking for a miscommunication and hurt feelings. Apologize, take responsibility, and show them a good time and you might be able to salvage the friendship.", "Nta,\n\n14 days is 2 weeks exactly and not 2 weeks and some days or 3 weeks. It is your friend's fault for being so ignorant and obtuse. And looking at her reaction I would act you to rethink your relationship with this friend after removing your rose-colored glasses and think back on your relationship has she always treated you this badly when things didn't go her way or you didn't do what she wanted ?", "You're NTA. This is absolutely her crummy communication. 14 days is 2 weeks, not sure how that became 3 weeks suddenly. And frankly, 2 weeks is already a pretty long time to have houseguests.\n\nIt's really a good thing this blow up happened now. Imagine if she were in your home, a couple days into her visit, and something upset her. You'd have an adult tantruming in your home, followed by angry and tense silences for the remainder of her visit.", "Is she's acting like that, why is it a loss of a friend.  16 days 16 years, who cares and move on", "NTA! Ummm this isn\u2019t how she should treat a friend OP. I know you think this is a \u201c16 year long friendship\u201d but how long as she been treating you like shit and walking all over you? She expected free lodging and free taxi service over Christmas for 3/4 of a month?!???? My god. She sounds exhausting", "NTA\n\nUh, no.  You're grieving the loss of a friend who, herself, has become selfish and careless.  And who shit talked you when  you politely pushed back.\n\nGood riddance.", "Why did you send her a message about it instead of giving her a call?  The whole misunderstanding about her length of stay could've been avoided. Also, why did you not question it when she told you in person 3 weeks? Why did you wait?\n\nIf she's your best friend, you handled it poorly. YTA", "She flat out refuses to see my point of view and believes it's ignorance on my part, not a miscommunication. The whole situation was blown out of proportion, I agree. Thanks for your input.", "My original post was way over the word limit, so sorry if this one is a little hazy!\n\nShe told me she was going to come for Christmas and then booked flights for two weeks. I'm sure we discussed this but I didn't take note of exact dates. She would've said it was two weeks, that's cool, I wouldn't have thought anything of it. \n\nWhile she was visiting, she told mentioned that she was staying for three weeks. This is why I messaged her.\n\nI looked back through our messages and couldn't find any evidence of dates, but a few days later found a screenshot. Her flights were booked for the 23/12/22 and 5/1/22. \n\nIt was never three weeks. I don't understand why she'd say three weeks and then also not mention it after I asked her about it via message.\n\nShe had made these plans around October. She was also visiting for a week in November, so the Christmas visit wasn't at the front of my mind.\n\nHope this clears things up a little.", "Well said \ud83d\udc4f", "She has never treated me like this before. Although, there was some drama when she was flatting with a mutual friend. In this context, this friend and my partner both agree that they're not surprised at her behaviour.", "She knows it's two weeks not three, but she kinda refuses to admit that she confused things by telling me it was three. \n\nBut yes, I agree, completely disrespectful. That'd been the kicker in this whole situation.", "Totally agree with you on the memory problem front hahaha. I think because she initially said two weeks, I was just chill with it and didn't think much of it. Turns out I should use a calendar more.", "This gave me a good laugh because she has said that I'm \"too empathetic\", so much so that I \"could be indoctrinated into a cult\".\n\nYou're right though.", "Unfortunately this is exactly where most of the outburst stemmed from. She's totally unwilling to acknowledge my perspective.\n\nInstead of the miscommunication (from my POV), she's turned it into \"regardless of how long it was, I'd do anything for you but you wouldn't do the same for me\".\n\nI really tried my best to explain.\n\nShe has told me that she's definitely not staying anymore.", "Totally valid. There was definitely a communication breakdown. If I do decide to call her, I'll let things cool off for a while. Although, after the things she said to me, I've got a bit of thinking to do.", "Fair call, I accept that.\n\nI didn't say anything initially because 1. it was the day before she left and I wanted to discuss it with my partner and 2. we were interrupted when I was about to bring it up. \n\nHonestly I didn't even think to call - I thought a casual message would suffice. In hindsight, a phone call would have been more appropriate.\n\nHaving said that, it also could've been avoided via message if she had corrected me at the beginning of the conversation.\n\nAll in all, I do agree with you that I could've handled it better.", "I agree with babymargaret. OP you did nothing wrong. You asked her about it and she derailed the conversation. To me it sounds like she did something shady and knew you were going to find out so she was putting it back on you. \n\nIf she said 14 days you could\u2019ve relied on what she said. \n\nBut instead she shoots with a nuclear weapon at a tiny fly. She is putting your friendship in danger. Not you.", "It does, thank you for clarifying. I stand by my original judgement, of course. Because as I said: in either scenario you would not be the ahole. You\u2019re allowed to change your mind as it\u2019s your house. \n\nBut as to why she suddenly changed it to three weeks? It\u2019s a mystery. I can\u2019t fathom why some one would so that and how some one would have the guts to do that without discussing with the host. Very strange behavior", "I\u2019m sorry there\u2019s no need to think about this too deeply.\n\nNo person should reasonably just assume they can impose on another person for a whole extra week without notice. I mean..having company over that long gets tiring.", "I think the \"gently probed\" is well put. I asked if she was planning on staying with us for a whole three weeks (again, turns out it was never three weeks), but I never said she couldn't stay with us at all.\n\nThe other week came into play purely because she told me she was staying for three weeks during her last visit. That's it.", "Please just remove her from your life.", "Ya I\u2019ve learned to just set reminders for everything. The problem is if she was really your friend she would understand that about you and not yell at you and degrade you for it.", "*You have compassion and understand people have emotions, you cultist!* She\u2019s a strange one lol", "She clearly isn\u2019t willing to do anything for you, by not being willing to listen or give you a benefit of the doubt. So saying so is pure guilt trip and manipulation. \n\nYou say in another comment that your partner and a mutual friend who lives with her are not surprised at her behavior. If this is typical as seen by others and only surprises you, I wonder if this is perhaps the first time you have told her \u201cno\u201d to anything, and this made her usual mask to you slip.", "Trip is off then? That's really too bad. For both of you. Unfortunately, things said in anger stick even if she didn't mean it. They still came out with the intention to hurt and once that's been done the damage can be irreparable. \n\nDoesn't *have* to be that way ofc...hopefully you're able to salvage what was a long and good relationship. Good luck!", "Her reasoning behind saying three weeks was that it was \"easier than saying two weeks and a couple days\", which I just don't understand because it was always booked for two weeks. Just weird.", "Just to clarify, she never expected to stay for three weeks, only two.", "Memory lapse or not, her flying off the handle was unacceptable even for a 16 year friendship. If she was really a friend to you, she would have known that you had trouble remembering things and originally would have gently reminded you at some point it was more than 14 days in any capacity not \"three weeks\" all of the sudden when it was clear the original plans were for 14 days!\n\nAgain, she imploded your friendship. You have nothing to be sorry for and you did nothing wrong <3", "Thanks for your positivity, super appreciated.\n\nThis whole situation has really affected me, if I do come back from it, I think it'll take a while. There is a little more context in terms of her feelings about my partner. \n\nIn my last message to her I decided to confront it. Kate is pretty dismissive of my partner and doesn't make much of an effort.\n\nWhen Kate had coffee with a mutual friend, she admitted that during her stay, she was blatantly rude to my partner. She denied this to me, however.\n\nBut yeah, that definitely complicates things even more.", "To be honest I'd send her a screenshot of the dates she sent you, and say something like \"I'm sorry there have been crossed wires here, but as you can see from this message you sent on \\[date\\], your trip was originally for 14 days. That's 2 weeks. I understand your plans may have changed but that should have been communicated with me without assuming we could fit our plans around a longer break.\"\n\nShe seems to be having a fit around \"you saw the dates\", and you did. You saw the dates that covered 2 weeks. I doubt pointing that out with evidence will calm her down, but it at least you can say that she's mistaken when she insists that she told you something different.", "It's not 2 weeks and a couple of days though....\n\n14 days is two weeks. Her explanation makes no sense.", "You also never expected her to go nuclear on a 16y relationship, but here we are. NTA op. \n\nMore info please: what\u2019s the relationship like before this? Has she expected you to do things for her or has it been equal?", "I think at the end of the day, that's my issue. Her behaviour was completely uncalled for. When I confronted her about it she said of course she'd be upset and asked me what I'd expected.\n\nIt's just a big miscommunication turned ugly.\n\nThank you for your kind words <3", "Ah, yeah, that's gonna be hard to overlook. Beginning to sound as though this is a blessing in disguise, especially if her being rude is unwarranted or just for the sake of being rude. Even with long-term friendship it is hard to know who a person really is. I've lost good friends who I'd been close to for years only to have their true colors shown after a difficult situation. \n\nEither way, her behavior is not a reflection of you or your partner. Hopefully this doesn't darken the season for you too much and you're able to find the resolution that suits you best. Again, good luck!", "I think an important note is that from 2011 until the beginning of this year she lived overseas. I saw her twice over this period, although we did have regular contact via video call and message.\n\nAs an only child, she's the closest thing I have to a sibling. She's always been my older sister that's a bit blunt and protective of me. Sometimes this bluntness is a little abrasive to me, but I think that's just my personality.\n\nAs I mentioned in a separate thread, I think she takes issue with my partner. When I confronted this, she denied it and gave her reasoning. Although after she admitted to a mutual friend that she was rude to my partner, I'm inclined to not believe her."]}
