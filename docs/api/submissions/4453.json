She made arrangements and booked flights a few months ago and we discussed it in passing over video call. \n\nDuring a recent visit, the day before she returned home, she mentioned that she was staying for three weeks. I was taken aback by this, I thought it would only be 1.5-2 weeks. I don't doubt that she had told me the dates, but I'm sure I would've remembered if she had said three weeks. That's a long time to expect to stay with someone.\n\nI discussed this with my partner and we both concluded three weeks is too long. Christmas is a stressful time, we have family visiting from another city and overseas, and Kate and Chris have no transport so therefore rely on us to drive them places. We also have a very skittish and anxious cat who is usually allowed outside, but the vet advised us to keep him inside in case he runs away. Three weeks is a long time for him to be hiding under the bed.\n\nI decided to send Kate a message (17th Nov) asking if she was going to stay with her family at all over Christmas. I explained that three weeks is a long time, I'm totally happy if she stays for part of the time, and I hoped we could figure something out. I apologised and said that there must've been some sort of miscommunication.\n\nWhat followed was messages back and forth about how I fucked her over, ruined her plans, don't care about her, and wouldn't do the same for her as she would for me. She called me an asshole, a piece of shit, and said I had the flight details and that she wasn't going to hold my hand and explain it to me like a child. She said I was acting oblivious and was well aware of how long they were staying, and that we talked about the dates multiple times. She'll have to spend her first Christmas back in her home country alone.\n\nProblem is, looking back, I did have a screenshot of the flight details and she was here for exactly 14 days. Except, she said she was telling people three weeks because it was \"easier than saying two weeks and a few days\". But it was 14 days. Why would she tell me three weeks and also not correct me after the first message? \n\nTwo weeks would've been perfectly fine, I only brought it up because I thought she was staying for three weeks, and now it has ruined a 16 year long friendship.\n\nI feel awful about this whole thing. When she said three weeks, I panicked and didn't think to double check the dates. Now I have to grieve the loss of a friend who thinks I'm selfish and careless.", "created_utc": 1670751894, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zimei1/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_and_her_fianc\u00e9/", "score": 258, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She changed it without telling you and that\u2019s completely out of line. \n\nIf you had the dates, and they were for three weeks, then you were careless and that wouldn\u2019t be cool.

You're entitled to having your home and you actually gently probed on whether or not she was staying else where when you questioned it. Where did the other week come into factor?\n\nTo me, and my personal opinion, is she's using you as a free vacation resort and when you didnt just lie down and allow her to do it, she showed her true colors, yes even after 16 years. You didn't ruin anything, she ruined it by feeling entitled to your time and your home during a busy season generally for everyone. \n\nYou're not selfish and careless. Selfish and careless would have told her that she had to find a hotel room during her 14 day visit, instead you offered her your home. You did nothing wrong.

She mistakenly said 3 weeks when it was only 2 - which should have been easy to correct.  But rather than just clarify the length of her visit, she went nuclear with personal attacks.  She was downright abusive.  I would never be comfortable hosting her after such a viscous attack.\n\nClaiming that she would do more for you than you do for her is so hypocritical since she couldn\u2019t even be bothered to iron out a small misunderstanding.

I would never expect my friend to keep me for 3 weeks when home for a visit. It\u2019s too much. She\u2019s also been really rude by saying you\u2019ve fucked her over.

You can just say OK so of course I though it was originally two weeks per your screen shot and our discussions then when you started saying three weeks I thought it got extended without informing me\u2026etc.   she went way overboard with her response", "YTA for not looking at the dates when she set it up AND when you asked her to change them.", "YTA, even if it had been three weeks, you should not have tried to rescind once the flights were booked to the dates you agreed. At that point, it\u2019s time to suck it up, be a good host, and remind yourself to check the dates more closely next time. \n\nAlso , never try to have a tricky conversation like this over text, you\u2019re just asking for a miscommunication and hurt feelings.

It is your friend's fault for being so ignorant and obtuse. And looking at her reaction I would act you to rethink your relationship with this friend after removing your rose-colored glasses and think back on your relationship has she always treated you this badly when things didn't go her way or you didn't do what she wanted ?", "You're NTA. This is absolutely her crummy communication. 14 days is 2 weeks, not sure how that became 3 weeks suddenly. And frankly, 2 weeks is already a pretty long time to have houseguests.\n\nIt's really a good thing this blow up happened now. Imagine if she were in your home, a couple days into her visit, and something upset her. You'd have an adult tantruming in your home, followed by angry and tense silences for the remainder of her visit.", "Is she's acting like that, why is it a loss of a friend.  16 days 16 years, who cares and move on", "NTA! Ummm this isn\u2019t how she should treat a friend OP. I know you think this is a \u201c16 year long friendship\u201d but how long as she been treating you like shit and walking all over you? She expected free lodging and free taxi service over Christmas for 3/4 of a month?!???? My god. She sounds exhausting", "NTA\n\nUh, no.  You're grieving the loss of a friend who, herself, has become selfish and careless.  And who shit talked you when  you politely pushed back.\n\nGood riddance.", "Why did you send her a message about it instead of giving her a call?  The whole misunderstanding about her length of stay could've been avoided. Also, why did you not question it when she told you in person 3 weeks? Why did you wait?\n\nIf she's your best friend, you handled it poorly. YTA", "She flat out refuses to see my point of view and believes it's ignorance on my part, not a miscommunication. The whole situation was blown out of proportion, I agree. Thanks for your input.", "My original post was way over the word limit, so sorry if this one is a little hazy!\n\nShe told me she was going to come for Christmas and then booked flights for two weeks. I'm sure we discussed this but I didn't take note of exact dates. She would've said it was two weeks, that's cool, I wouldn't have thought anything of it. \n\nWhile she was visiting, she told mentioned that she was staying for three weeks. This is why I messaged her.\n\nI looked back through our messages and couldn't find any evidence of dates, but a few days later found a screenshot. Her flights were booked for the 23/12/22 and 5/1/22. \n\nIt was never three weeks. I don't understand why she'd say three weeks and then also not mention it after I asked her about it via message.\n\nShe had made these plans around October. She was also visiting for a week in November, so the Christmas visit wasn't at the front of my mind.\n\nHope this clears things up a little.", "Well said \ud83d\udc4f", "She has never treated me like this before. Although, there was some drama when she was flatting with a mutual friend. In this context, this friend and my partner both agree that they're not surprised at her behaviour.", "She knows it's two weeks not three, but she kinda refuses to admit that she confused things by telling me it was three. \n\nBut yes, I agree, completely disrespectful. That'd been the kicker in this whole situation.", "Totally agree with you on the memory problem front hahaha. I think because she initially said two weeks, I was just chill with it and didn't think much of it. Turns out I should use a calendar more.", "This gave me a good laugh because she has said that I'm \"too empathetic\", so much so that I \"could be indoctrinated into a cult\".\n\nYou're right though.", "Unfortunately this is exactly where most of the outburst stemmed from. She's totally unwilling to acknowledge my perspective.\n\nInstead of the miscommunication (from my POV), she's turned it into \"regardless of how long it was, I'd do anything for you but you wouldn't do the same for me\".\n\nI really tried my best to explain.\n\nShe has told me that she's definitely not staying anymore.", "Totally valid. There was definitely a communication breakdown. If I do decide to call her, I'll let things cool off for a while. Although, after the things she said to me, I've got a bit of thinking to do.", "Fair call, I accept that.\n\nI didn't say anything initially because 1. it was the day before she left and I wanted to discuss it with my partner and 2. we were interrupted when I was about to bring it up. \n\nHonestly I didn't even think to call - I thought a casual message would suffice. In hindsight, a phone call would have been more appropriate.\n\nHaving said that, it also could've been avoided via message if she had corrected me at the beginning of the conversation.\n\nAll in all, I do agree with you that I could've handled it better.", "I agree with babymargaret. OP you did nothing wrong. You asked her about it and she derailed the conversation. To me it sounds like she did something shady and knew you were going to find out so she was putting it back on you. \n\nIf she said 14 days you could\u2019ve relied on what she said. \n\nBut instead she shoots with a nuclear weapon at a tiny fly. She is putting your friendship in danger. Not you.", "It does, thank you for clarifying. I stand by my original judgement, of course. Because as I said: in either scenario you would not be the ahole. You\u2019re allowed to change your mind as it\u2019s your house. \n\nBut as to why she suddenly changed it to three weeks? It\u2019s a mystery. I can\u2019t fathom why some one would so that and how some one would have the guts to do that without discussing with the host. Very strange behavior", "I\u2019m sorry there\u2019s no need to think about this too deeply.\n\nNo person should reasonably just assume they can impose on another person for a whole extra week without notice. I mean..having company over that long gets tiring.", "I think the \"gently probed\" is well put. I asked if she was planning on staying with us for a whole three weeks (again, turns out it was never three weeks), but I never said she couldn't stay with us at all.\n\nThe other week came into play purely because she told me she was staying for three weeks during her last visit. That's it.", "Please just remove her from your life.", "Ya I\u2019ve learned to just set reminders for everything. The problem is if she was really your friend she would understand that about you and not yell at you and degrade you for it.", "*You have compassion and understand people have emotions, you cultist!* She\u2019s a strange one lol", "She clearly isn\u2019t willing to do anything for you, by not being willing to listen or give you a benefit of the doubt. So saying so is pure guilt trip and manipulation. \n\nYou say in another comment that your partner and a mutual friend who lives with her are not surprised at her behavior. If this is typical as seen by others and only surprises you, I wonder if this is perhaps the first time you have told her \u201cno\u201d to anything, and this made her usual mask to you slip.", "Trip is off then? That's really too bad. For both of you. Unfortunately, things said in anger stick even if she didn't mean it. They still came out with the intention to hurt and once that's been done the damage can be irreparable. \n\nDoesn't *have* to be that way ofc...hopefully you're able to salvage what was a long and good relationship. Good luck!", "Her reasoning behind saying three weeks was that it was \"easier than saying two weeks and a couple days\", which I just don't understand because it was always booked for two weeks. Just weird.", "Just to clarify, she never expected to stay for three weeks, only two.", "Memory lapse or not, her flying off the handle was unacceptable even for a 16 year friendship. If she was really a friend to you, she would have known that you had trouble remembering things and originally would have gently reminded you at some point it was more than 14 days in any capacity not \"three weeks\" all of the sudden when it was clear the original plans were for 14 days!\n\nAgain, she imploded your friendship. You have nothing to be sorry for and you did nothing wrong <3", "Thanks for your positivity, super appreciated.\n\nThis whole situation has really affected me, if I do come back from it, I think it'll take a while. There is a little more context in terms of her feelings about my partner. \n\nIn my last message to her I decided to confront it. Kate is pretty dismissive of my partner and doesn't make much of an effort.\n\nWhen Kate had coffee with a mutual friend, she admitted that during her stay, she was blatantly rude to my partner. She denied this to me, however.\n\nBut yeah, that definitely complicates things even more.", "To be honest I'd send her a screenshot of the dates she sent you, and say something like \"I'm sorry there have been crossed wires here, but as you can see from this message you sent on \\[date\\], your trip was originally for 14 days. That's 2 weeks. I understand your plans may have changed but that should have been communicated with me without assuming we could fit our plans around a longer break.\"\n\nShe seems to be having a fit around \"you saw the dates\", and you did. You saw the dates that covered 2 weeks. I doubt pointing that out with evidence will calm her down, but it at least you can say that she's mistaken when she insists that she told you something different.", "It's not 2 weeks and a couple of days though....\n\n14 days is two weeks. Her explanation makes no sense.", "You also never expected her to go nuclear on a 16y relationship, but here we are. NTA op. \n\nMore info please: what\u2019s the relationship like before this? Has she expected you to do things for her or has it been equal?", "I think at the end of the day, that's my issue. Her behaviour was completely uncalled for. When I confronted her about it she said of course she'd be upset and asked me what I'd expected.\n\nIt's just a big miscommunication turned ugly.\n\nThank you for your kind words <3", "Ah, yeah, that's gonna be hard to overlook. Beginning to sound as though this is a blessing in disguise, especially if her being rude is unwarranted or just for the sake of being rude. Even with long-term friendship it is hard to know who a person really is. I've lost good friends who I'd been close to for years only to have their true colors shown after a difficult situation. \n\nEither way, her behavior is not a reflection of you or your partner. Hopefully this doesn't darken the season for you too much and you're able to find the resolution that suits you best. Again, good luck!", "I think an important note is that from 2011 until the beginning of this year she lived overseas. I saw her twice over this period, although we did have regular contact via video call and message.\n\nAs an only child, she's the closest thing I have to a sibling. She's always been my older sister that's a bit blunt and protective of me. Sometimes this bluntness is a little abrasive to me, but I think that's just my personality.\n\nAs I mentioned in a separate thread, I think she takes issue with my partner. When I confronted this, she denied it and gave her reasoning. Although after she admitted to a mutual friend that she was rude to my partner, I'm inclined to not believe her.", "I mean if she\u2019s willing to throw away a 16 year friendship over something so stupid I think it\u2019s for the better the relationship is ending.", "NTA .. an the way she responded and calling you the things she did - I would tell her she i no longer welcome", "Info: how many days does your friend think are in a week?", "Sounds like a free escape from Kate! Nta", "NTA, send the original picture back and tell Kate her reaction is not ok.", "This reminds me of when I was in my early 20s and had a cousin that lived 8 hours away that would come to visit me.\nShe'd always just tell me her arrival date,  but not the end date. I'd always be too shy to ask how long she was staying. I'm an introvert and really needed the time to mentally prepare ahead of time, lol.\nOne year, when she arrived, I got the courage to ask how long she'd be with us (me and my bf). A week. Oh God a whole week. She had another friend in the same city that she said she'd stay with a couple nights. When the day arrived for her to go to her friends place, I had to \"gently probe\" asking what time she was going, was she getting picked up, etc. She said oh my friend said she's breaking up with her boyfriend tonight so I can't stay there. \ud83d\ude1f\nThe friend didn't break up with her bf, it was obviously an excuse to avoid a house guest.\nBut I always found it so weird that my cousin would keep me in the dark about her plans and put me in the position to have to ask. It was like her weird way of controlling the situation.\nI wouldn't be too shy to ask now. It would be the first thing out of my mouth. \nSo far off topic of OP's post, I just felt like ranting haha", "NTA. What a weird and overblown misunderstanding. Maybe it would have been better if you would have put her flight details in your calendar, but I don\u2019t think this would have prevented the miscommunication about the three weeks / 14 days.", "NTA. Maybe she\u2019s your best friend, but you\u2019re definitely not her best friend. She\u2019s just using you. The way she replied and talk down to you is not how anyone talks to their best friends or even people in the inner circle. \n\nIt\u2019s not a situation that\u2019s blown out of proportion. It\u2019s how it is.", "NTA. Even if you were simply letting her know 3 weeks is too long and you can\u2019t accommodate her for the entirety of her trip, you wouldn\u2019t be. Her reaction makes her one, tho. Imagine having a friend who\u2019s willing to let you and your fianc\u00e9 stay with them during such a busy time and reacting like that when the friend expresses any concern! OP, unless she\u2019s going through some really intense personal stuff and acting out of character, you do not need someone like that as a friend. I hope she realizes her reaction was unacceptable and apologizes to you.", "NTA. I'd just tell her \"oh it really is booked for 2 weeks as originally planned!. Perfect. Looking forward to seeing you\". If she's still going on about it, let her stay somewhere else and re-evaluate your friendship.  \nI could picture something like this happening to me by not reviewing the flight schedule closely enough. But you were relying on the info she was telling you first hand \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. It's not a huge deal and there's no reason she should make it be.", "It's ok i would not want dependent and needy frns, i had my fair share of helping friends with accomodation and making my husband uncomfortable. They treat us like housekeepers. I stopped welcoming all. NTA", "NTA but you need to apologize and accept what comes. As you said, the holidays are tough, so while I doubt a friendship that long leaves anything to the imagination, there may be something else at play here you're not seeing. \n\nI'm hoping she either comes to you with the whole story about why she's so upset or you get a call after the holiday stress is over with an acknowledgement of your apology and another one in return.", "NTA. I know what it's like to lose a longtime friend, but I feel it's best you saw how unreasonable she is instead of waiting another sixteen years to find out. Who knows, maybe over Christmas you might have forgotten how she takes her coffee and she would have killed you in your sleep.", "Honestly her reaction is so overboard i wonder if she was looking for a reason to get out of it. \n\nNTA at all", "I live in a one bedroom apartment, before I met my husband I let my friend and her then 1 y/o child stay with me, they stayed for 8 weeks. If she was as good a friend as you say then 3 weeks is not that long. YTA", "Nta.... sounds like somethings up on your friends end. Screen shot where she says 2 weeks (months ago). Remind her that she now said 3 weeks. And that communication is very important. And then tell her it's her choice to either follow thru or not. Put it on her, she's ussing righteous indignation on you to feeling better about her shi**y behavior. If she was a good friend, y'all would be able to talk it out and clear the air with little to no issues. She sounds like a headache you wouldn't want anyway.... specially around the holidays.", "I'm not sure it's going over the top if someone who offered to let you stay with them over a span of dates suddenly changes that offer simply because they never looked at a calendar. Who knows what OP's flightiness may have cost the friend monetarily. \n\nBut OP isn't wrong, 3 weeks is a VERY long time to have guests. No one wants guests that long, even if it is your best friend. \n\nI feel like this is swinging somewhere between ESH and NAH", "This. Op. Read. This.", "Yeah. I get the impression that the friend asked & *told* OP the dates she would be staying. All the arrangements have initially come from that 'friend' and OP agreed to them.\n\nInviting yourself the day before Christmas eve into *another* household and planning to stay into the new year was one hell of a cheeky ask to start with. Especially when you're also expecting your hosts to act as your unpaid chauffeur.  *Who* invites themselves into another household's christmas plans without being invited?", "Also someone who calls me a piece of s** wouldn't be allowed to put a foot in my door", "It sounds like she is doubling down and being petty.", "I\u2019m sorry this ruined your 16 year long friendship, but this friend is either totally unstable or wasn\u2019t a very nice person to begin with. The name calling and attacks when you went to set up a reasonable boundary are big red flags. I\u2019d let her find somewhere else to stay, unless she offers a groveling apology for being foul and entitled. NTA.", "I think the responses of your other friend and partner speak volumes.\n\nI'd suggest that it's time to be simply civil and factual with your friend, show the original text regarding the dates, and reiterate that you're fine with a 1.5 to 2 week stay, but cannot host her beyond (date).  If she had problems with that, then suggest she should stay with her relatives or other friends and it is impossible for her to stay beyond Jan 1.  Don't give reasons why - she'll just argue with reasons.  Just say \"sorry, we can't have you as a guest after Jan 1\".\n\nHaving a friend stay for two weeks, and you supplying all the transportation is already bending over backwards.  Based on her bad response, I think she's showing indications that she'd be an unpleasant guest.  Maybe one of those guests that expect you to be a concierge/housewife - to provide food, cook, clean, and plan/pay for outings every day.", "So she\u2019s ready to blow up a 16 years old friendship AND her holiday plans just because she\u2019s too proud to be accountable for causing confusion and blowing things out of proportions? This sounds like a ego issue to me more than anything. \nWhy people are more willing to lose friendship and love rather than simply say sorry is wild to me.\nSo sorry for you OP. Loosing a long time friendship over one\u2019s ego is just sad\u2026 but I guess now you saw the real nature of your friendship: no matter how good of a friend you are, how selfless and supportive, your relationship was never as important as preserving HER ego and meeting HER needs, aka it was a one way friendship. \ud83d\ude3f\n\nNTA", "Talk to her about how you feel. Something else might be going on in her life. She's not allowed to take it out on you, sure, but in a 16 year friendship these times WILL come. Nobody is perfect all the time. Tell her she's welcome and you believe you will get over that fight, let her tell you if something else's going on. I am sorry you are going through this.", "If OP *did* know the days and after booking the flights changed her mind, she would be a bit of YTA. Of course technically she can do whatever she wants since it\u2019s her house, but it would make that TA for imposing additional expenses on her friend for changing the flights, just because she did not make up her mind before - again: just if she was informed of the correct dates, and if nothing else was going on.", "NTA - this whole issue is because your friend seemingly can't count. Maybe she's confused because weeks are counted in 7 days but her reaction is totally unnecessary with the name calling and honestly, you don't need someone like that in life. Sounds like you have enough to deal with over this holiday season with your cat and visiting family. Just count this as a blessing!", "Everything she provided to you indicated she would stay 14 days, which is exactly 2-weeks.  Contrary to all of the information you had been provided, she began for some unknown reason telling you she was staying for 3-weeks.  You told her that was too long and she blew up at you.  \n\nNTA.  She screwed up by telling you she wound be staying for three weeks.  She needs to apologize for how she treated you.", "I don't want to go to the \"gaslighting\" term, but telling someone that your perception of reality is wrong(that she \"wasn't\" rude to your partner) and then confirming to your mutual friend that she was--is a very low key version of it.\n\nShe could also be ashamed of her behavior so couldn't admit it to you.", "Travel time might make it 16 days from the traveller\u2019s perspective (I.e., have to leave for the airport on the 22nd, not get all the way home until the 6th).  And they probably booked 3 weeks holiday from work.   So I can kind of see it turning into a \u201c3 week holiday\u201d.\n\nBut still, when talking to your host, you\u2019re only staying with them for 14 days.  Was on the guest to realise how it could sound and then apologise and correct the miscommunication.", "Her plans haven\u2019t changed.  It was 14 days and is still 14 days.   \n\nThe problem is the guest suddenly started describing 23/12 to 5/1 as 3 weeks, scaring OP, leading to a big argument that was completely unnecessary, because it\u2019s really 2 weeks (as agreed)."]}
