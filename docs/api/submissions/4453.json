She made arrangements and booked flights a few months ago and we discussed it in passing over video call. \n\nDuring a recent visit, the day before she returned home, she mentioned that she was staying for three weeks. I was taken aback by this, I thought it would only be 1.5-2 weeks. I don't doubt that she had told me the dates, but I'm sure I would've remembered if she had said three weeks. That's a long time to expect to stay with someone.\n\nI discussed this with my partner and we both concluded three weeks is too long. Christmas is a stressful time, we have family visiting from another city and overseas, and Kate and Chris have no transport so therefore rely on us to drive them places. We also have a very skittish and anxious cat who is usually allowed outside, but the vet advised us to keep him inside in case he runs away. Three weeks is a long time for him to be hiding under the bed.\n\nI decided to send Kate a message (17th Nov) asking if she was going to stay with her family at all over Christmas. I explained that three weeks is a long time, I'm totally happy if she stays for part of the time, and I hoped we could figure something out. I apologised and said that there must've been some sort of miscommunication.\n\nWhat followed was messages back and forth about how I fucked her over, ruined her plans, don't care about her, and wouldn't do the same for her as she would for me. She called me an asshole, a piece of shit, and said I had the flight details and that she wasn't going to hold my hand and explain it to me like a child. She said I was acting oblivious and was well aware of how long they were staying, and that we talked about the dates multiple times. She'll have to spend her first Christmas back in her home country alone.\n\nProblem is, looking back, I did have a screenshot of the flight details and she was here for exactly 14 days. Except, she said she was telling people three weeks because it was \"easier than saying two weeks and a few days\". But it was 14 days. Why would she tell me three weeks and also not correct me after the first message? \n\nTwo weeks would've been perfectly fine, I only brought it up because I thought she was staying for three weeks, and now it has ruined a 16 year long friendship.\n\nI feel awful about this whole thing. When she said three weeks, I panicked and didn't think to double check the dates. Now I have to grieve the loss of a friend who thinks I'm selfish and careless.", "created_utc": 1670751894, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zimei1/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_and_her_fianc\u00e9/", "score": 2241, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She changed it without telling you and that\u2019s completely out of line. \n\nIf you had the dates, and they were for three weeks, then you were careless and that wouldn\u2019t be cool.

You're entitled to having your home and you actually gently probed on whether or not she was staying else where when you questioned it. Where did the other week come into factor?\n\nTo me, and my personal opinion, is she's using you as a free vacation resort and when you didnt just lie down and allow her to do it, she showed her true colors, yes even after 16 years. You didn't ruin anything, she ruined it by feeling entitled to your time and your home during a busy season generally for everyone. \n\nYou're not selfish and careless. Selfish and careless would have told her that she had to find a hotel room during her 14 day visit, instead you offered her your home. You did nothing wrong.

She mistakenly said 3 weeks when it was only 2 - which should have been easy to correct.  But rather than just clarify the length of her visit, she went nuclear with personal attacks.  She was downright abusive.  I would never be comfortable hosting her after such a viscous attack.\n\nClaiming that she would do more for you than you do for her is so hypocritical since she couldn\u2019t even be bothered to iron out a small misunderstanding.

I would never expect my friend to keep me for 3 weeks when home for a visit. It\u2019s too much. She\u2019s also been really rude by saying you\u2019ve fucked her over. Sounds like a bit of a drama queen.", "NTA. She could have easily corrected herself and said \"the ticket says 2 weeks, my mistake\", crisis averted. She must have changed her ticket. \n\nOnce the insults started flying, the hosting offer should have gone from 2 weeks to 0 weeks.\n\nThere's something very sketchy going on, and it makes me wonder if she was planning on staying even longer than 3 weeks. If you have the trip id, can you check if the details of the original ticket have been changed?", "NTA. You can just say OK so of course I though it was originally two weeks per your screen shot and our discussions then when you started saying three weeks I thought it got extended without informing me\u2026etc.   she went way overboard with her response", "YTA for not looking at the dates when she set it up AND when you asked her to change them.", "YTA, even if it had been three weeks, you should not have tried to rescind once the flights were booked to the dates you agreed. At that point, it\u2019s time to suck it up, be a good host, and remind yourself to check the dates more closely next time. \n\nAlso , never try to have a tricky conversation like this over text, you\u2019re just asking for a miscommunication and hurt feelings.

It is your friend's fault for being so ignorant and obtuse. And looking at her reaction I would act you to rethink your relationship with this friend after removing your rose-colored glasses and think back on your relationship has she always treated you this badly when things didn't go her way or you didn't do what she wanted ?", "You're NTA. This is absolutely her crummy communication. 14 days is 2 weeks, not sure how that became 3 weeks suddenly. And frankly, 2 weeks is already a pretty long time to have houseguests.\n\nIt's really a good thing this blow up happened now. Imagine if she were in your home, a couple days into her visit, and something upset her. You'd have an adult tantruming in your home, followed by angry and tense silences for the remainder of her visit.", "Is she's acting like that, why is it a loss of a friend.  16 days 16 years, who cares and move on", "NTA! Ummm this isn\u2019t how she should treat a friend OP. I know you think this is a \u201c16 year long friendship\u201d but how long as she been treating you like shit and walking all over you? She expected free lodging and free taxi service over Christmas for 3/4 of a month?!???? My god. She sounds exhausting", "NTA\n\nUh, no.  You're grieving the loss of a friend who, herself, has become selfish and careless.  And who shit talked you when  you politely pushed back.\n\nGood riddance.", "Why did you send her a message about it instead of giving her a call?  The whole misunderstanding about her length of stay could've been avoided. Also, why did you not question it when she told you in person 3 weeks? Why did you wait?\n\nIf she's your best friend, you handled it poorly. YTA", "She flat out refuses to see my point of view and believes it's ignorance on my part, not a miscommunication. The whole situation was blown out of proportion, I agree. Thanks for your input.", "My original post was way over the word limit, so sorry if this one is a little hazy!\n\nShe told me she was going to come for Christmas and then booked flights for two weeks. I'm sure we discussed this but I didn't take note of exact dates. She would've said it was two weeks, that's cool, I wouldn't have thought anything of it. \n\nWhile she was visiting, she told mentioned that she was staying for three weeks. This is why I messaged her.\n\nI looked back through our messages and couldn't find any evidence of dates, but a few days later found a screenshot. Her flights were booked for the 23/12/22 and 5/1/22. \n\nIt was never three weeks. I don't understand why she'd say three weeks and then also not mention it after I asked her about it via message.\n\nShe had made these plans around October. She was also visiting for a week in November, so the Christmas visit wasn't at the front of my mind.\n\nHope this clears things up a little.", "Well said \ud83d\udc4f", "She has never treated me like this before. Although, there was some drama when she was flatting with a mutual friend. In this context, this friend and my partner both agree that they're not surprised at her behaviour.", "She knows it's two weeks not three, but she kinda refuses to admit that she confused things by telling me it was three. \n\nBut yes, I agree, completely disrespectful. That'd been the kicker in this whole situation.", "Totally agree with you on the memory problem front hahaha. I think because she initially said two weeks, I was just chill with it and didn't think much of it. Turns out I should use a calendar more.", "This gave me a good laugh because she has said that I'm \"too empathetic\", so much so that I \"could be indoctrinated into a cult\".\n\nYou're right though.", "Unfortunately this is exactly where most of the outburst stemmed from. She's totally unwilling to acknowledge my perspective.\n\nInstead of the miscommunication (from my POV), she's turned it into \"regardless of how long it was, I'd do anything for you but you wouldn't do the same for me\".\n\nI really tried my best to explain.\n\nShe has told me that she's definitely not staying anymore.", "Totally valid. There was definitely a communication breakdown. If I do decide to call her, I'll let things cool off for a while. Although, after the things she said to me, I've got a bit of thinking to do.", "Fair call, I accept that.\n\nI didn't say anything initially because 1. it was the day before she left and I wanted to discuss it with my partner and 2. we were interrupted when I was about to bring it up. \n\nHonestly I didn't even think to call - I thought a casual message would suffice. In hindsight, a phone call would have been more appropriate.\n\nHaving said that, it also could've been avoided via message if she had corrected me at the beginning of the conversation.\n\nAll in all, I do agree with you that I could've handled it better.", "I agree with babymargaret. OP you did nothing wrong. You asked her about it and she derailed the conversation. To me it sounds like she did something shady and knew you were going to find out so she was putting it back on you. \n\nIf she said 14 days you could\u2019ve relied on what she said. \n\nBut instead she shoots with a nuclear weapon at a tiny fly. She is putting your friendship in danger. Not you.", "It does, thank you for clarifying. I stand by my original judgement, of course. Because as I said: in either scenario you would not be the ahole. You\u2019re allowed to change your mind as it\u2019s your house. \n\nBut as to why she suddenly changed it to three weeks? It\u2019s a mystery. I can\u2019t fathom why some one would so that and how some one would have the guts to do that without discussing with the host. Very strange behavior", "I\u2019m sorry there\u2019s no need to think about this too deeply.\n\nNo person should reasonably just assume they can impose on another person for a whole extra week without notice. I mean..having company over that long gets tiring.", "I think the \"gently probed\" is well put. I asked if she was planning on staying with us for a whole three weeks (again, turns out it was never three weeks), but I never said she couldn't stay with us at all.\n\nThe other week came into play purely because she told me she was staying for three weeks during her last visit. That's it.", "Please just remove her from your life.", "Ya I\u2019ve learned to just set reminders for everything. The problem is if she was really your friend she would understand that about you and not yell at you and degrade you for it.", "*You have compassion and understand people have emotions, you cultist!* She\u2019s a strange one lol", "She clearly isn\u2019t willing to do anything for you, by not being willing to listen or give you a benefit of the doubt. So saying so is pure guilt trip and manipulation. \n\nYou say in another comment that your partner and a mutual friend who lives with her are not surprised at her behavior. If this is typical as seen by others and only surprises you, I wonder if this is perhaps the first time you have told her \u201cno\u201d to anything, and this made her usual mask to you slip.", "Trip is off then? That's really too bad. For both of you. Unfortunately, things said in anger stick even if she didn't mean it. They still came out with the intention to hurt and once that's been done the damage can be irreparable. \n\nDoesn't *have* to be that way ofc...hopefully you're able to salvage what was a long and good relationship. Good luck!", "Her reasoning behind saying three weeks was that it was \"easier than saying two weeks and a couple days\", which I just don't understand because it was always booked for two weeks. Just weird.", "Just to clarify, she never expected to stay for three weeks, only two.", "Memory lapse or not, her flying off the handle was unacceptable even for a 16 year friendship. If she was really a friend to you, she would have known that you had trouble remembering things and originally would have gently reminded you at some point it was more than 14 days in any capacity not \"three weeks\" all of the sudden when it was clear the original plans were for 14 days!\n\nAgain, she imploded your friendship. You have nothing to be sorry for and you did nothing wrong <3", "Thanks for your positivity, super appreciated.\n\nThis whole situation has really affected me, if I do come back from it, I think it'll take a while. There is a little more context in terms of her feelings about my partner. \n\nIn my last message to her I decided to confront it. Kate is pretty dismissive of my partner and doesn't make much of an effort.\n\nWhen Kate had coffee with a mutual friend, she admitted that during her stay, she was blatantly rude to my partner. She denied this to me, however.\n\nBut yeah, that definitely complicates things even more.", "To be honest I'd send her a screenshot of the dates she sent you, and say something like \"I'm sorry there have been crossed wires here, but as you can see from this message you sent on \\[date\\], your trip was originally for 14 days. That's 2 weeks. I understand your plans may have changed but that should have been communicated with me without assuming we could fit our plans around a longer break.\"\n\nShe seems to be having a fit around \"you saw the dates\", and you did. You saw the dates that covered 2 weeks. I doubt pointing that out with evidence will calm her down, but it at least you can say that she's mistaken when she insists that she told you something different.", "It's not 2 weeks and a couple of days though....\n\n14 days is two weeks. Her explanation makes no sense.", "You also never expected her to go nuclear on a 16y relationship, but here we are. NTA op. \n\nMore info please: what\u2019s the relationship like before this? Has she expected you to do things for her or has it been equal?", "I think at the end of the day, that's my issue. Her behaviour was completely uncalled for. When I confronted her about it she said of course she'd be upset and asked me what I'd expected.\n\nIt's just a big miscommunication turned ugly.\n\nThank you for your kind words <3", "Ah, yeah, that's gonna be hard to overlook. Beginning to sound as though this is a blessing in disguise, especially if her being rude is unwarranted or just for the sake of being rude. Even with long-term friendship it is hard to know who a person really is. I've lost good friends who I'd been close to for years only to have their true colors shown after a difficult situation. \n\nEither way, her behavior is not a reflection of you or your partner. Hopefully this doesn't darken the season for you too much and you're able to find the resolution that suits you best. Again, good luck!", "I think an important note is that from 2011 until the beginning of this year she lived overseas. I saw her twice over this period, although we did have regular contact via video call and message.\n\nAs an only child, she's the closest thing I have to a sibling. She's always been my older sister that's a bit blunt and protective of me. Sometimes this bluntness is a little abrasive to me, but I think that's just my personality.\n\nAs I mentioned in a separate thread, I think she takes issue with my partner. When I confronted this, she denied it and gave her reasoning. Although after she admitted to a mutual friend that she was rude to my partner, I'm inclined to not believe her.", "I mean if she\u2019s willing to throw away a 16 year friendship over something so stupid I think it\u2019s for the better the relationship is ending.", "NTA .. an the way she responded and calling you the things she did - I would tell her she i no longer welcome", "Info: how many days does your friend think are in a week?", "Sounds like a free escape from Kate! Nta", "NTA, send the original picture back and tell Kate her reaction is not ok.", "This reminds me of when I was in my early 20s and had a cousin that lived 8 hours away that would come to visit me.\nShe'd always just tell me her arrival date,  but not the end date. I'd always be too shy to ask how long she was staying. I'm an introvert and really needed the time to mentally prepare ahead of time, lol.\nOne year, when she arrived, I got the courage to ask how long she'd be with us (me and my bf). A week. Oh God a whole week. She had another friend in the same city that she said she'd stay with a couple nights. When the day arrived for her to go to her friends place, I had to \"gently probe\" asking what time she was going, was she getting picked up, etc. She said oh my friend said she's breaking up with her boyfriend tonight so I can't stay there. \ud83d\ude1f\nThe friend didn't break up with her bf, it was obviously an excuse to avoid a house guest.\nBut I always found it so weird that my cousin would keep me in the dark about her plans and put me in the position to have to ask. It was like her weird way of controlling the situation.\nI wouldn't be too shy to ask now. It would be the first thing out of my mouth. \nSo far off topic of OP's post, I just felt like ranting haha", "NTA. What a weird and overblown misunderstanding. Maybe it would have been better if you would have put her flight details in your calendar, but I don\u2019t think this would have prevented the miscommunication about the three weeks / 14 days.", "NTA. Maybe she\u2019s your best friend, but you\u2019re definitely not her best friend. She\u2019s just using you. The way she replied and talk down to you is not how anyone talks to their best friends or even people in the inner circle. \n\nIt\u2019s not a situation that\u2019s blown out of proportion. It\u2019s how it is.", "NTA. Even if you were simply letting her know 3 weeks is too long and you can\u2019t accommodate her for the entirety of her trip, you wouldn\u2019t be. Her reaction makes her one, tho. Imagine having a friend who\u2019s willing to let you and your fianc\u00e9 stay with them during such a busy time and reacting like that when the friend expresses any concern! OP, unless she\u2019s going through some really intense personal stuff and acting out of character, you do not need someone like that as a friend. I hope she realizes her reaction was unacceptable and apologizes to you.", "NTA. I'd just tell her \"oh it really is booked for 2 weeks as originally planned!. Perfect. Looking forward to seeing you\". If she's still going on about it, let her stay somewhere else and re-evaluate your friendship.  \nI could picture something like this happening to me by not reviewing the flight schedule closely enough. But you were relying on the info she was telling you first hand \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. It's not a huge deal and there's no reason she should make it be.", "It's ok i would not want dependent and needy frns, i had my fair share of helping friends with accomodation and making my husband uncomfortable. They treat us like housekeepers. I stopped welcoming all. NTA", "NTA but you need to apologize and accept what comes. As you said, the holidays are tough, so while I doubt a friendship that long leaves anything to the imagination, there may be something else at play here you're not seeing. \n\nI'm hoping she either comes to you with the whole story about why she's so upset or you get a call after the holiday stress is over with an acknowledgement of your apology and another one in return.", "NTA. I know what it's like to lose a longtime friend, but I feel it's best you saw how unreasonable she is instead of waiting another sixteen years to find out. Who knows, maybe over Christmas you might have forgotten how she takes her coffee and she would have killed you in your sleep.", "Honestly her reaction is so overboard i wonder if she was looking for a reason to get out of it. \n\nNTA at all", "I live in a one bedroom apartment, before I met my husband I let my friend and her then 1 y/o child stay with me, they stayed for 8 weeks. If she was as good a friend as you say then 3 weeks is not that long. YTA", "Nta.... sounds like somethings up on your friends end. Screen shot where she says 2 weeks (months ago). Remind her that she now said 3 weeks. And that communication is very important. And then tell her it's her choice to either follow thru or not. Put it on her, she's ussing righteous indignation on you to feeling better about her shi**y behavior. If she was a good friend, y'all would be able to talk it out and clear the air with little to no issues. She sounds like a headache you wouldn't want anyway.... specially around the holidays.", "I'm not sure it's going over the top if someone who offered to let you stay with them over a span of dates suddenly changes that offer simply because they never looked at a calendar.

My mother is exactly like your friend - tells everyone else in her life her plans - but NEVER tells the people whom those plans relate to.\n\nLast year she came for a visit for the holiday season (roughly 10 days with me). Was then to spend Xmas with my stepsister before heading up north with a friend. Boxing day she turns up on my doorstep to stay another week that I was never aware of.

Her supposed best friend is happy to host her for dates that were sent and agreed to and after tickets are bought and paid for she suddenly doesn't have a place to stay.  Yes it was a misunderstanding on your part but put yourself in her shoes for a minute and see how bad your actions were.\n\nYou should have asked for clarification when you were first taken aback.  Instead your silence was taken as further confirmation especially since you already had the flight details and to her nothing had changed.  Wanting to talk things over with your partner is always good but you not doing the basics of double checking dates either through asking or looking at what she had already sent you before telling her she was there too long was careless.\n\nHer reaction wasn't great but intentionally or not you hurt her first and I don't see you acknowledge that.  Some things can't be fixed by saying oops sorry.  I get the feeling that this isn't the first time she has had to keep repeating herself to you, it may be best for her if you just let this friendship go.\n\nAnd before the echo chamber starts screaming 3 weeks... She is there over 3 separate weeks, not 3 weeks time.  She shows up the first, stays the second and leaves on the third.  While I personally would say 2 weeks, I can easily see how she said/saw it as 3.

She can still stay with you, and you'd like to put this behind you, but the ball is in her court. \n\nHowever... I'm of the mindset that when someone is doing you a favor, you DO need to hold their hand through it. People are busy and it's helpful to remind them of dates.

Christmas stay).", "I'm wondering if OP lives in a tourist destination, eg NYC, Oahu, London, etc, and the friend is used to using OP as a free hotel and free taxi service.", "Cats kill about million native birds a year in NZ, as well as a significant number of small mammals and insects. They are incredibly effective hunters and while bells minimise hunting, they don't completely stop it. They also don't always bring home or eat their kills, so your cats may still be hunting even if you aren't aware of it.", "domestic cats are actually considered to be an invasive species in multiple countries, not just the US. New Zealand, where OP is from, also has a huge issue with cats killing wildlife.\n\nand to be clear: cats being allowed outside is still widely accepted in the US, **and** they\u2019re considered to be an invasive species here.", "Sorry, Christchurch specifically.", "I was trying to figure out why she could've exploded like that, over seemingly nothing. I'm so sorry, OP. It doesn't make sense. You absolutely didn't do anything wrong, though. It's up to the guest to confirm the dates and let the host know that the travel plans are still going ahead on *x* date and *y* date, so you didn't even do anything wrong there with confirming. And hosting over the holidays is a really kind thing to do!\n\nI just can't figure out why, if she was coming solely to visit you, that she would just go off like this. Makes no sense.", "As far as I remember, it was a \"we're going to come down for Christmas\" or \"we thought we'd come down for Christmas\".", "During her last week-long stay, she didn't wash a single dish, we cooked together once, and admitted to a mutual friend that she was outwardly rude to my partner.", "Her friend def was NOT using as a term of endearment.", "I wonder if she was looking at a calendar instead of counting days. Like, 23rd & 24th were the extra days, and she counted the 25th-31st as a week and the 1st-5th as a week? Like this: [LINK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HnUutat8ZhmPglSqwrXcshez-VLnVz5l/view?usp=drivesdk)", "And your response to that?\n\n\"It would be lovely to see you. Where are you planning to stay?\"\n\nWhy does she expect that she can invite herself to stay in your house for a two week stay? I think she's the AH for her reaction but I think you need to reflect on your communication and the boundaries in this friendship.", "You can tell they're from the US because literally anywhere else you would just call this a fortnight.", "I\u2019m so sorry that she\u2019s doing this to you. It\u2019s not fair of her and it looks like respect isnt what she intends to offer for the friendship.", "NTA - I think your friend has changed more than you realize. She did borderline gaslighting to you and exploded on you instead of talking things through calmly.", "NTA. I had a friend like this. She only ever saw her point of view and was just the worst trying to communicate with because she took everything as a personal attack and was so fucking entitled. I ended our 11 year friendship last year and haven\u2019t looked back. I know 16 years is a long time, but when someone treats you like that, it\u2019s time to walk away. She needs to understand the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her, especially when you\u2019d be the one hosting them in your home, over the holidays, and when they\u2019d be relying on you for transportation. That\u2019s a lot to ask of someone. You deserve a better friend who is more understanding.", "If she was an actual real friend, she would not have treated you like complete shit just because you weren't available to be a free hotel for her for 3 weeks. She would have worked with you to make a plan that everyone was good with. She's not a true friend. You're better off know that.", "NTA", "Send back the screen shot and say I thought it was 14 days. NTA", "Actually, who confuses 14 days for 2 weeks and a few days? 14 days is 2 weeks, period. Where did the \u201cand a few days\u201d even come from? Also, if it were 2 weeks and 5-6 days, they\u2019d have been totally justified in calling it 3 weeks.", "NTA. In all her carrying on, it seems she didn't check her own emails. I dunno; this is a weird story.\n\nI'm not sure I'd want to kiss and make up with someone who behaved that way. People do change, and you're lucky if friendships last forever. Her rotten attitude suggests to me that bad stuff was unspoken, at least by her. You never knows what's in someone else's mind. I'm sorry this happened to you.", "NTA - I would send her a screenshot of the dates and say, \"I was under the impression you'd be here exactly 2 weeks, which is fine by me. When you said 3 weeks, I figured plans had somehow changed without me knowing. But now that I see it's still only 2 weeks, there's no issue. The issue was in the miscommunication of 2 weeks vs. 3 weeks. But these dates have settled that issue. It's 2 weeks and I'm good with that.\"", "NTA and a true friend would not have reacted the way she did. She sounds horrible, and why is she telling everyone it's three weeks if it is really two weeks?", "Totally agree, thanks Thong_ripper_ \ud83d\ude02\n\nI even told her she was quick to believe my actions were a personal attack. She is acting entitled, you're right.\n\nIt's been really helpful to hear others' experiences, so thank for sharing.", "Unfortunately I already did and this is where most of what she said stemmed from.", "You don\u2019t speak to someone like this period. Jfc \n\nCan you freak out a little? Sure. But name calling is absolutely unnecessary", "OO, correct the date.", "My understanding of what happened is more like \n\nOP : \u201chey, I think you\u2019re planning to stay for longer than we\u2019re actually comfortable with, I think you should find somewhere else to stay\u201d \n\nFriend : \u201cWhat do you mean? We confirmed these plans months ago\u201c\n\nOP : \u201cyeah, I guess is misunderstood something, sorry, it just doesn\u2019t work\u201d \n\nFriend : \u201cwhat the fuck do you mean you misunderstood, we sent the dates and everything\u201d \n\nAlso, op mentioned something about her friend visiting her \u201chome country\u201d so I get the sense that this trip is international, not something you can just change around at the last minute, hence why plans were confirmed so far in advance.", "Well then she has decided that she is done. Maybe when she is not so angry she might be able to talk about it. My guess is that she was really hurt and thought you just didn't want her there at all. Send her something she likes , eatable fruit basket, cheese basket with a heart felt note and then wait to see what happens. If she doesn't contact you then you have to let it go.", "And it isn't even like OP was the one who made a mistake. There's evidence that it was supposed to be a 14 day trip. 14 days is not 3 weeks. She's throwing the entire friendship under the bus because she isn't willing to admit that she's wrong. Agreed, OP is better off without someone who would turn on them this viciously when they did absolutely nothing wrong.", "this is EXACTLY what happened. thank you for simplifying, a lot of people seem to be confused.", "also to add, she moved back to new zealand in january. the trip is between cities here.", "Fyi that says you need to request access to view it's not open to anyone with a link you can fix it in settings", "\u201cShe\u2019d do anything for me\u201d\nYou know how many times I\u2019ve heard that from a best friend and they actually step up when I need something? ZERO\n\nIt\u2019s the ones who don\u2019t feel the need to advertise the fact that they would do anything for you (especially when they are asking you for something) who would actually do anything for you. \n\nDrop her. I know it sucks and it hurts, but she\u2019s trying to manipulate you, while gaslighting you. That\u2019s abusive and you\u2019re hurting yourself by staying friends with someone who abuses you.", "NTA. This is 100% on your friend. Instead of blowing up, insulting you, and acting like and all-around lunatic over you having the dates, she should have clarified that she was in fact miscommunicating the dates to not just you, but everyone, for no reason. If someone says 3 weeks, rational people would assume they mean 3 weeks. It would not have taken her any extra effort to calmly tell you it's 14 days when you said 3 weeks was too long. Because it's not 3 weeks. I'm going in circles with this and it's dumb, sorry.", "Was she telling everyone it\u2019s 3 weeks because the time she wasn\u2019t with you she\u2019s staying with an affair partner? I mean her reaction screams affair or psychological stress/disorder. Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into it, but NTA for stating boundaries.", "> she said she was telling people three weeks because it was \"easier than saying two weeks and a few days\". But it was 14 days. \n\nHey OP, is there any chance your friend is an idiot who thinks a week is 5 days? Like she\u2019s counting business days for some stupid reason? Because 5 + 5 + 4 would be 14.", "You knew her dates. You complained that she was going to stay too long and told her she needed to stay elsewhere. Even though she wasn't staying too long, but it is up to her to tell you that it isn't actually too long because you still have no idea what is going on despite agreeing to it. And so  it is her fault that you told her to stay somewhere else after letting her book tickets  because you have no idea what is going on in your own life and panicked without checking. YTA and I can't believe that Reddit is letting you off for this. Your ex-friend is not likely to agree with the opinion here so I guess you will be suffering the consequences regardless.", "It\u2019s hard for me to imagine Kate changing her flights without confirming the new dates with OP. I mean it certainly could have happened, but it doesn\u2019t really sound like she did? I still don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s been saying 3 weeks though.", "I agree! If Kate weren't being shady, she would have just repeated the ticket dates and asked OP to verify the dates. She'd have said something along the lines of, \"You were okay with the ticket dates when I sent them to you, what changed?\" Jumping straight to \"how could you fuck me over like this!\" is very DARVO.", "Well for her sake, I really hope not.", "I mean, it would be pretty shitty to tell someone they could stay for X amount of time, and then shorten it a few weeks before their flights.", "We don\u2019t know that Kate changed the dates though. We just know she was saying 3 weeks because\u2026 reasons?", "Yep, agreed. Makes no sense. You have at least one very stupid person, as many as three, and at least two people who suck at communication.", "I was thinking the opposite. It seems like such an extreme reaction that I wonder if OP is leaving something out.", "This whole thing is weird though, because she was still only planning on staying for 2 weeks, she just said 3 weeks instead of 2 for whatever reason. And OP also told her she couldn\u2019t stay the whole time without even double checking or confirming the dates? Seems weird to me.", "The other possibility is that because those 14 days technically fall on 3 weeks on a calendar that she thought it was 3 weeks. It wouldn\u2019t excuse her behavior though.", "Yea, and she didn\u2019t check the details until after confronting the friend?", "Okay but what HAS she done for you? Because that \"i would do aNyThInG for you\" sounds like a lot of big talk for someone that doesn't know 2 weeks is exactly 14 days. Yikes.", "Lmao, I feel like this has to be it. I can\u2019t think of any other rational explanation."]}
