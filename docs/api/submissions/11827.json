A couple of days ago we got into argument because I told him that he wouldn\u2019t be the person I called if I had an emergency. \n\n   A little background on why I said this. He used to be the person I called if I had an emergency but every single time I have called him he has let me down. I called him when I found out I needed surgery on my knee and asked if he could take me and pick me up. He told me that work was more important.  When I went into anaphylactic shock I called him and again work was more important and my boss and one of my coworkers left work to take me to the hospital and stayed with me the whole time. When my brother passed away I called him for emotional support and all he said was that sucks. Lastly this summer by back window on my car literally exploded when I was driving with my daughter, I called him and he said he didn\u2019t know what I expected him to do and hung up the phone. I called my boss again who came and helped me. \n\n   When I told him this he said it was mean and hurtful and asked me how he isn\u2019t there for me. I told him all the things I mentioned above. He then asked me how I\u2019ve ever helped him when he had an emergency.  I brought up giving him a place to live when he almost became homeless, dropping everything when he got into a car accident and driving around to get him the parts he needed to fix his car, giving him my old car to drive after another car accident ( he also got into an accident in my old car), giving him my old iPhone when he dropped his into a lake and couldn\u2019t afford to get a new one and giving him money when he doesn\u2019t have enough to cover his bills. I\u2019m also the one who pays for all the house hold needs like bills, food and anything else that\u2019s needed. I also do 95% of the cleaning and all of the cooking. \n\n   After telling him all this he said that me not texting him in the morning is the same thing as him not showing up for me in emergency situations and that his job is more important that I am to him. We\u2019ve barely talked since the fight and are sleeping in different beds. \nSo AITA for telling him that he\u2019s not the person I would call anymore if I need help?\n\nEdit or add: so this got more comments than I thought it would in a short amount of time. I thought I would maybe get like 10 max. I do have a skewed view on what a \u201cgood\u201d relationship should be since my only other serious relationships where extremely abusive. So my view point for a long time was well if he\u2019s not screaming at me and hitting me it\u2019s not a bad relationship. \n   Im leaving the country in about a week for a vacation and my plan is to have him full move out while I\u2019m gone.  I don\u2019t think after this I will try to be in another relationship for a while and work on building up my view of myself and being kinder to myself.", "created_utc": 1678318807, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mc623/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_that_he_wouldnt_be/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's pretty customary to call your partner  or other loved ones when emergencies happen, both to let them know what's happening and for emotional support. Even if she didn't call professionals first, that can be attributed to many things while it's not perfectly rational.

To me that's not how someone who's having an allergic reaction react.....they call 911. You know to make sure they don't die", "Not that I\u2019ve seen from him. I have people that work on the property I live on that I can have supervise him moving out", "We have no shared bank accounts or anything like that. Everything is in my name and he\u2019s never had access to any of my important accounts.", "Medical assistance and emotional support aren't mutually exclusive. You can need both at once. It's not really your place to say what someone needs in response to emergencies, nor is it possible to categorically determine what someone needs. In that same vein of thought, while it seems that you would not *personally* need emotional support following a serious medical issue, it doesn't seem charitable to call \"bullshit\" using your personal needs as a universal. Clearly, because OP called her boyfriend, she needed his support.", "Might be a good idea to ask them to \"help\" him move out? Hard to say how messy breakups are going to get ahead of time.", "Please secure any valuables you have because people who may not usually be vindictive may become so, and i anticipate he will not take you telling him to move out well.", "Think you missed why I called bullshit. \n\nIf I get shot I'm calling 911 and than my partner,  you know to make sure I don't die.  I won't call my partner and seek their help unless they have medical training.  That's why I called b.s. hey could be wrong but I'm sticking to it", "I'm really not trying to be difficult, but I genuinely don't understand how this comment is different than your other comments. The way I'm interpreting this is that you used another personal, hypothetical anecdote to describe what you would've done differently, and because OP did not act how you would've acted, her entire post is \"bullshit\". \n\nAlso, getting shot and having anaphylaxis are not the same thing. Most people who have allergic reactions at this level of severity are prescribed auto-injectable devices like EpiPens which *is* the emergency treatment (though you still have to go to the hospital after)."]}
