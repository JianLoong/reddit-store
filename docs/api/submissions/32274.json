You stated that you would be responsible for tidying up the office. As long as you\u2019re not leaving things in there that could attract vermin, and it doesn\u2019t sound like you are, and it isn\u2019t a fire hazard, she should just leave it alone. \n\n\nMy husband\u2019s den/man cave whatever you want to call it is so disorganized and cluttered that it makes me genuinely wonder how he can find or do anything in there. Because he does basic upkeep or allows me to do what he cannot, he physically cannot run a vacuum. I leave the clutter and him alone.  It\u2019s his space. If it ever truly bothered me I can shut the door.", "NTA Office space is personal. As a messy worker, I can say that someone else rearranging my things would make me so disorganized I wouldn't know where anything was. I leave things in very specific locations based on what needs to be done when.\n\nThat said, as long as there's no food, dirty dishes, or garbage to attract unwelcome guests, bacteria, or sickness, this space is yours and should be cleaned the way you (and only you) want it done.", "NTA, you can close the door so she never has to look at it. Would it be appropriate for someone to go to their SO\u2019s office to tidy their desk? Absolutely not. Same applies here. It might be more of a situation to compromise if the office was part of a common space, but it\u2019s not.", "NTA my partners garage and office/room are his where he is free to leave things all over. My room/antiques room and all the common areas our bedroom included are tidy to my standards. It\u2019s a great compromise.", "NTA.  Each of us has a very specific way we work and handle physical papers.  During the week day, the desk in my home office is a bit of a mess - or would appear that way to someone else.  I know where everything is and am using everything that is out.  On Fridays, I put things away that are done and organize for Monday, close the door, and don't open it again until Monday morning.  I need my stacks out.", "I have a workout room where I also do my makeup and have a closet of clothes\u2026. And 90% of the time it looks like a tornado has gone through. And that\u2019s how I like it. It\u2019s rude to leave clothes on the floor of a shared bedroom, it\u2019s untidy and messy to leave makeup on the counter in the bathroom. This room is my sanctuary where I don\u2019t have to think about it. It\u2019s like my 15 yr old bedroom lol. My partner pokes his head in every now and then and asks why I don\u2019t clean it up and I just say I prefer it this way. The freedom to try on an outfit and not like it and grab the next thing without picking the other thing up, turning it back from inside out, hanging it on a hanger. Tired and want to put on pj pants? Whip off those jeans! On the floor unbothered and blissfully forgotten about. A small detail I don\u2019t have to adult over. \nMy makeup is spread out on a Mat on the floor in front of a big mirror. I can see everything, I can grab anything, I can get real close to the mirror and do my makeup. It\u2019s exactly how I did my makeup when i was in jr high and high school. It\u2019s pure comfort. And then of course my actual workouts- my weights I keep generally tidy in a line up simply so I don\u2019t trip on them but I know where they are, and sometimes I place them down exactly how I picked them up and then they are ready for the next time I do that same move. \n\nIt\u2019s YOUR room.

I work from home, and my desk area is almost always less tidy than the rest of my home for exactly the reason you said - because I like my stuff to be where I can get at it.

Why is it my girlfriends standards that matter? Should I get on say at all?", "Then split it by square footage.", "It would still end up equal considering she has a desk and makeup etc in the other spare room", "It wouldn't, though, because you call your room \"your\" office and the room she has her makeup in, \"the spare room.\" She's also not the one who required the space. You did."]}
