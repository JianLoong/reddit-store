It went really well and I think I\u2019ve made some potentially really great friends. My husband has my location, knew where I was and who I was with but became very upset when I called him after to tell him how it went. Before I could tell him about my day he went in on how the last few times he didn\u2019t get texts back from people they died. This immediately made me cry and feel guilty. But at the same time he had all this prior info, he knew how excited I was and I had told him I\u2019d be putting my phone on vibrate to not be rude around new people. He hasn\u2019t even asked me how it went or about the women I met.

Demanding that you always respond immediately is extremely controlling.", "NTA - You told him where you were going to be, and a rough idea of who you were with PLUS he could see your location (if I read the text correctly) Your husband needs therapy for his PTSD. There is zero reason for him to guilt you.", "Edit: I am not a therapist, so I\u2019m guessing as to why he acted the way he did. \n\nNAH. Your actions were those  of a lonely person who had just made connections. His reaction was one of deep trauma. I can\u2019t blame either of you for how you did things.\n\nThat said, he needs help. Whether he admits it or not, ANYONE who loses two people to self deletion in a year needs help. He is absolutely controlling not out of abuse, but out of the need for stability and an acute fear of loss. \n\nEncourage him to get into therapy. Go with him if need be. Run, don\u2019t walk.", "NTA\n\nyou let you\u2019re husband know that you\u2019d be busy with you\u2019re book club. you provided you\u2019re  location and did everything you could do. i get that he gets nervous when people don\u2019t respond right away, but you were busy so it\u2019s not your fault you couldn\u2019t respond", "NAH. You're not the asshole. And nor is he, he's traumatised. Maybe be more clear next time, and say that you will be unavailable to reply between set times. You had told him your phone would be on vibrate, but that doesn't necessarily mean you won't respond. Hopefully total clarity will help him accept your unavailability during certain times without too much worry. You need to be allowed to be busy sometimes!", "NTA in spite of the fact his trauma is real and needs attention.", "NTA, have a conversation where you express that you had a specific amount of time for your book club, and that he can take deep breaths and use coping skills, and then at that time, say it starts at 3 and ends at like 4:30, he can check in and be like, hey. I've been worried I know it's my fear and PTSD, could you contact me soon, I will start worrying in the next 30 minutes.\n\nAlso, ask him to get counseling, and possibly couples therapy cause the control aspect of this is extremely inappropriate.  As other redditors said, the isolation is dangerous and if you let him take control of you he's just going to keep doing it.", "You are not obligated to keep your phone on 24/7 and respond immediately to incoming calls and texts. You just aren't. When you are at work, attending an appointment, at the movies, having dinner, or in some other kind of a meeting - any situation where you are expected to be \"present\" - it is perfectly acceptable to put your phone away until the designated time for that activity has ended. \n\nHe knew, and his attitude is just being petty and controling. He needs to get over that. \n\nDon't let him play a guilt card.  And here's a counter to that - Whenever you leave him, or talk to him on the phone, let the last words you say to him be \"I love you.\" And always say it with meaning. Then it won't matter if you don't text him back. The last words you will ever have spoken to him will be \"I Love You.\" That beats the hell out of any unanswered text.", "NTA. It sounds like he's isolating you. He knows how much you're struggling with making friends and the one time he has a social event he was aware of, he goes crazy when you don't reply to a text? \u26f3\u26f3\u26f3", "NTA\n\nTrauma may not be your husband's fault, but how he responds to it is. You did nothing wrong. He knew where you were and that you would be occupied. You responded as soon as the event was over.\n\nHis trauma dumping on you when you don't cater to his preferences is not ok. You need to sit down and explain while you understand, you can't be on eggshells in case a message comes in when you guys are apart. That is not healthy, and, whether he intends it to be or not, controlling. It is reasonable to be upset if you are well past when you said you would be home and not responding. It is not reasonable to be upset when you aren't responding when he knows you are busy. If this upsets him that much, he really needs to consider hashing this out with a therapist instead of lashing out at you", "NAH. \n\nOP, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong at all. Don\u2019t feel guilty.\n\nYour husband has some issues to deal with and responded in a way that is pretty understandable, IMO. Hopefully after he\u2019s calmed down, you can discuss this with him and it could be a small piece to him re-building his psyche. I\u2019m not usually one to say this (unlike lots of people on reddit) but the dude might actually need a therapist. Two suicides in a short time span if immediate family members is\u2026too many. \n\nSide note: kinda shocked (but not really) some people, after reading the information here, would say this is just another manipulative guy. His reaction was wrong but what do you expect new and (I assume) untreated PTSD to look like? No, OP can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t just capitulate to appeasing that side of him, but JFC.", "NAH\n\nYou weren\u2019t wrong and he can\u2019t help his condition being triggered. It\u2019s going to take him time to recover.", "NTA. His problem is legitimate, his solution is not. There's a wide range of \"solutions\" he could demand, like you never leaving his sight, staying on a call with him at all times, etc etc. None of them would be ok, and neither is demanding you reply to him any time he decides to do a pulse check on you. \n\nControl is not the answer. Therapy is. Just because something appeases him, doesn't mean it's right. You have a right to live your life without causing him to panic.\n\nAlso, beyond the initial panic, the fact that AFTER he's calmed down and seen you are fine, and he STILL hasn't asked how it went or apologized at all means that part of his attitude isn't panic-induced, it's just him acting selfish.\n\nHe needs to get therapy before his controlling behavior escalates and you are wrapped up in doing 1000 \"little\" toxic things to keep the peace.", "NTA. My dad died very suddenly while I was pregnant and it caused some serious separation anxiety. I started to panic everytime someone didn't answer their phone but that's not on them, it's on me. \nI can't make everyone pick up asap just because I called. I had to work that out.", "NAH. This is gonna be a process. I wish you both the best of luck.", "NTA. He knew where you were - and that you would be participating in a social activity where being on your phone would be an issue. Why did he text AT ALL? You say he had PTSD... what treatment is he seeking? It was unreasonable for him to text you at a time he knew you wouldn't be able to respond and then get upset with you for not responding.", "NTA.  Your husband needs therapy because this guilt trip/trauma dump he put on you is not healthy for either of you.", "NAH", "Sorry, but YTA. You knew about his trauma and his anxious response to not receiving a response beforehand. It was not a good move to put your phone on vibrate in order to \u201cnot be rude\u201d and if you felt you had to leave it on vibrate you should have been extra sensitive to feel when it went off. Nobody is going to say anything about you taking literally one second to reassure your traumatized husband. Yes his anxiety doesn\u2019t make sense, people who suffer from anxiety know that it doesn\u2019t. No amount of logic or explaining is going to get rid of that reaction right now. Hopefully he is getting help, and with that help he will be able to work through his issues. As for him not asking about how you he had already been driven into a state of panic where he probably was literally unable to think straight enough to ask those questions. I highly doubt he is being controlling or trying to isolate you like some others are saying. He does want you to go out, but you need to understand that for the time being you should respond with a quick message letting him know you\u2019re ok when he texts.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was so anxious and leading up to today and even right before I left he was telling me how fun it would be and how excited he was for me but it all went out the window when I didn\u2019t text him back. He only texted me twice: once telling me to have fun and not be nervous and then another an hour later asking to call when I finished. Which I did the moment I finished. I didn\u2019t have any missed calls or anything else that would\u2019ve led me to think I was making him worry or be upset.
