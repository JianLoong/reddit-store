Again, it was just stocking shelves for minimum wage. Assuming he's working 8 hour shifts for around 10 bucks an hour he's choosing 80 bucks a shift over his promise to her multiple times in a row. If they REALLY need that 80 bucks then that's a conversation they should sit down and have as partners who need to be responsible about finances. But if he's doing it on a whim it is kind of shitty. \n\nI can absolutely see how yall took it the way you did and it's possible you're entirely right. I'm just adding my own perspective on how I read it as it does change the meaning behind it.

That ship has passed and he missed getting onboard 3 times now.  The thing here is that on any of these occasions he could have said no to his boss as he was not required to go in just because he was asked.  He should have said no the first time.  The fact that he then bailed on you 2 more times shows that he does really place much priority on you or what you want. You really didn't ask for much and him trying to \"make it up to you\" by picking you up fast food and sticking a candle on the table 3 weeks after your Birthday is extremely lame, and kinda insulting.   Now he's pouting about it weeks later because you weren't grateful enough for the almost no effort he put into your Bday.

What\u2019s wrong here is that he\u2019s simultaneously behaving like his job is so important that it\u2019s more important than his relationship with you, while also having zero real ambition to do better than Walmart. \n\nIf he really gave a fuck about you (or even about his career tbh), there are FAR better ways he could be spending his time than taking extra shifts. Especially true considering you\u2019re a nurse and the breadwinner here. And especially on your bday of all things\u2026\n\nAlso the way he tried to make it up to you was pathetic.

However, calling his job one a monkey could do and something with no prospects, then saying that a job like first responder or EMT (a similar job to your own, nurse) are the only ones important enough to justify his behavior, is unkind. You're implying that his job and income are worthless compared to yours. (I also want to point out that aside from making extra money, he might be worried about being laid off, or perhaps his job is badly understaffed and really does need extra help.)\n\nI would suggest this: talk to Rick and apologize for what you said about his job and acknowledge that it was wrong. Tell him that you value him as a person, and appreciate that he contributes to the household. Then explain to him that you felt undervalued by his actions, as though he thought more of his job than of you. Also explain how hurt you felt when he got mad at you for celebrating on your own -- you couldn't have known he would be able to get the night off, and it's not wrong for you to treat yourself. Then say that him spending time with you and making you feel loved are of great value to you, and you would like it if he could cut back on work some in order to spend more time with you.
