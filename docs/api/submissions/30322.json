The night of, Rick (BF, 23M) got called in to work to cover a shift.\n\nOkay, disappointing but that's his work and it happens a lot.\n\nWe tried to reschedule for the following weekend. Again, he got called in to work. Rick tried to make up for it by giving me a necklace from his work but I didn't take it. It felt like a half-assed attempt at an excuse.\n\nThird time this happened, Rick gets called in to work again. I begged him to not take the shift but he did it anyway. Rick said that his manager really needed coverage that night.\n\nSo by now, I haven't been able to celebrate my birthday. We live in a more rural area, away from my family and friends. I'm not close to his family. So I went, \"fuck it\". I went into town, watched the Taylor Swift movie and had dinner at the tapas place. I didn't want to go back home so I rented a hotel room for the night.\n\nWhen I go back, Rick was pissed. He managed to talk his manager into letting him leave early! He tried to make up for missing tapas and bowling by getting fucking Whataburger and making a candlelit dinner out of it to surprise me.\n\nI told him that this isn't what I wanted and that if he really cared about my birthday, he wouldn't have taken those shifts on the weekends that we had planned my birthday on!!!\n\nHe called me ungrateful and that I need to deal with it. I told hm that if he was an EMT or police or a first responder, then I would be more understanding because those jobs actually help the community. But he's makes minimum wage stocking shelves at Walmart and doesn't have any other plans going for him. Even a monkey can do his job.\n\nI told him that I didn't want to celebrate my birthday with him anymore and to just drop it. It's been a couple of weeks and he's still pouting about it.

And even then it wasn't what you asked, and what you did ask for really wasn't much (bowling and a meal!)\n\nI wouldn't say to break up over this or anything so dramatic, but I think him being unreliable and having the audacity to sulk for weeks on end are two big red flags. Keep an eye on it.", "ESH. Him for not prioritizing your bday, and calling you ungrateful and telling you to deal with it. \n\n\u2026but you for looking down at his job. You would have been fine with this had he been an EMT, but because he\u2019s a stocker, and \u2018has nothing else going for him\u2019, and his job is so easy that \u2018a monkey could do it\u2019, it\u2019s not ok? \n\nI smell doom for you two.", "I\u2019ve worked in several food stores, and no one gets called in that many times.

Dont feel bad about celebrating on your own.", "I was with you until you decided to demean his job.  I don't have any warm fuzzy feelings for the walton family either, but that was a low blow IMO.  \n\nESH \n\nEncourage him to look for better work, but don't be an AH going about it.", "You are not asking for much.  He should have told his boss the first call...sorry...no....I have something important. \n\nWhataburger by candlelight is not acceptable. \n\nWhy don't you find a man who comes through for you.\n\nI would call this situation. And his sulking. A RED fjag.", "ESH.\n\nHe could have made more of an effort to prioritize you and your birthday, but at the same time, that doesn't give you the right to denigrate him about his job. You make it sound like it's something shameful, and something to be embarrassed about. Customer service is actually hella difficult, having to deal with people day in and day out who treat them like absolute shit.", "INFO: What is yalls budget like atm? Good on bills and everything caught up or is he taking all the hours he can to tread water?", "NTA.  Rick seems to have a problem with setting boundaries.  I don't think you should tell him that his job is worthless.  But he needs to also understand that the job is not his life and he needs to set his priorities straight.  He should not feel obliged to work every extra shift he's asked, especially when it's at your expense.  How committed is he to this relationship?  Makes me wonder.", "NTA, I celebrate my birthday without my husband because he never makes an effort for my birthday and I have a brilliant time now (apart from his sulking when I go out for the day without him).", "Your BF's a loser. Move on.", "That's insulting to the monkey. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nHe needs to grow a back bone and stand up to his boss. To cancel plans for one short notice shift is understandable but several times I can understand why you gave up waiting for him.", "ESH \n\nGee, I wonder why he doesn\u2019t prioritize you\u2026.. you are callous and mean as hell. He shouldn\u2019t avoid you tho, he should dump you. Wtf?", "Edited because I made too many judgements.\n\nESH for being mean spirited to each other.\n\nI get that he was upset you weren't around to receive his gift. It probably feels to him like you don't appreciate the efforts he does make?\n\nBut, its not like *I'm* waiting three weeks to celebrate my own birthday with no plan having been discussed or committed to, either.\n\nI can't argue about him taking the shifts. I've had jobs where it really wasn't my option or in my best interest to not respond when they called me in. It sucked. But, I needed the job and the benefits associated with the job and I put up with a lot of crap because of my needs - not because I wasn't aware of a life outside of work.\n\nBut, about you treating yourself? Who can blame you for that? It was deserved and you get to show yourself you matter at least some of the time. Its was not OK to denigrate his job and say its without value. That was unnecessary and just mean spirited.\n\n(I would not spend the night away from home without telling my husband in advance, though because it would frighten him - not piss him off.)", "He makes minimum wage stocking shelves at Walmart and doesn't have any other plans going for him.

Don\u2019t care if I get downvoted but come on your not a child", "ESH. He didn't prioritize you for over a month and then didn't bither to tell you hen he arranged to be home. He just expected you to sit around and wait for him to fit you in. You had every reason to go out and celebrate on your own. What he planned was lazy and too little, too late. However, insulting his job was really low of you. This isn't about your birthday anymore. You told him he's worthless and you don't respect him. It seems like you should end this relationship now. You can't unsay what you said and you obviously meant it. He is not the guy for you.", "ESH.

Even a monkey can do his job.\n\nYTA, what a disgusting comment to make. The way you said it makes me think he\u2019s working his ass off to afford things while ur jobless ass sits at home whining about everything. He probably takes those extra shift offers because he fucking needs the money. If you want him there so bad while he needs money go work an extra shift urself so he won\u2019t have to, isn\u2019t that an idea?", "YTA.  \"...he's makes minimum wage stocking shelves at Walmart and doesn't have any other plans going for him.

I would follow my schedule and kept my promise to my other half. \n\nThis dude needs to go into a trade or something. There's no climbing respectably in walmart. NTA to the chick. He could have taken time off. He just didn't care. Also, fuxking What a burger!? I'm a low maintenance chick but fuck him for thinking that is equal to tapas. I could tell she would have even paid for it, she just wanted his company.", "Seriously, why is OP with this guy. He doesn't prioritize her, she doesn't respect him.", "Yeeeap. So 100% on her side, and even understandable when she started in on his job, because the pressure to cover an EMT job is different to retail... and then we get to \"a monkey could do his job.\" WTF. \n\nESH and mostly her. \u2010_-", "If what he does pays *my* bills, all I have for that is gratitude and good wishes.

I mean, cold whataburger.....those fries do NOT travel well.", "Even the store manager's priority is customer service and the return sale that comes from good customer service.", "YOU ARE NOT UNGRATEFUL, THOUGH. THAT PART IS BS IMO.", "Agree.", "He got that for himself, not OP.", "I took that comment more to mean \"They didn't need you, anyone could have filled that role. It's not like you're the only neurosurgeon on call and was required to come in or risk a life. Worst case scenario a few shelves at Walmart go unfilled\"\n\nGranted DEFINITELY not how you want to phrase it with someone you care about but this is to say it didn't feel so much as looking down on them and more \"they didn't need you there. You could have skipped *one shift* to keep your plans with me. Especially the third time this happened\" \n\nAs for the \"Nothing else going for you\" bit again, AWFUL phrasing but when I initially read it, it felt like pointing out this wasn't working as many shifts as possible gunning for a promotion (a stereotype we often hear for workaholics). Again, it was just stocking shelves for minimum wage. Assuming he's working 8 hour shifts for around 10 bucks an hour he's choosing 80 bucks a shift over his promise to her multiple times in a row. If they REALLY need that 80 bucks then that's a conversation they should sit down and have as partners who need to be responsible about finances. But if he's doing it on a whim it is kind of shitty. \n\nI can absolutely see how yall took it the way you did and it's possible you're entirely right. I'm just adding my own perspective on how I read it as it does change the meaning behind it. From \"you're pathetic and lesser than\" to \"why are you prioritizing this shift over me multiple times in a row?\"", "It must be hard to have a partner who can tear down your efforts so easily.\n\nOn one hand, he\u2019s working every shift possible. On the other hand, he\u2019s pretty worthless and a monkey could do it. \n\nI do feel badly for him, not her.", "<<he does pays my bills,>>  \nPlease tell me where in POST or later comments you got the information that HE pays all her bills?\n\nClearly she has her own money or she wouldn't have been able to go to movie, eat at Tapas and rent a hotel room.\n\nAnd then to be called ungrateful for not sitting at HOME for a THIRD time after he cancelled?  I'd be steamed and I'd likely express my displeasure in a less than nice way.  He had no problem dissing her for somehow not reading his mind that THIS time he'd make the most minimal effort possible for her.", "Exactly. He\u2019s full of shit, she needs to run", "She apparently works as a nurse at that according to her one comment, she's probably more likely to be paying his bills."]}
