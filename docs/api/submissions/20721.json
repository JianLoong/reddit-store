He said no, she tried grabbing the baby anyways. I flipped out and told her to leave and she says \"I just need my baby fix since I can't have babies\".

For that reason you're NTA for flipping out imo. And you're definitely NTA for wanting to be comfortable with who's around your baby.\n\nYour SIL clearly has a lot of issues (both mentally and physically). Your husband really need to make clear boundaries with her and make sure you're comfortable with the wellbeing of your baby. He should have done that a long time ago, so this situation is partly his fault. If SIL cant accept those boundaries then she's not welcome.", "NTA for not wanting her to take care of your kid based on her past actions, but definitely TA for telling her it wasn't your fault she can't have kids. Yes, she's pushy, but there's no need to be unkind.", "YTA for what you said.  100%. Total AH. \nSomething traumatic happened to a 14 year old girl. She was taken advantage of. She got an STD. Now she\u2019s sterile. That is horrific. I guarantee her weight problems are directly tied to being SAed as a young teen. What a tragic, awful burden to carry through life. \n\nYou are not required to allow her to watch your child. You don\u2019t owe her a baby fix. You can even be concerned that she has boundary issues and may no know best practices when it comes to holding and caring for infants. \n\nYou do need to treat her with civility and humanity. You owe her an apology for spitting her personal tragedy in her face.", "NTA-Your daughter is not her emotional support animal nor her fix. You need to do what you deem best for your daughter.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a real shame that she cannot have children nor can she foster or adopt. I\u2019ve been in her shoes since I was sixteen but that doesn\u2019t mean the family have to give up their children to her upon demand or do something that makes them feel unsafe when it comes to their kids. \n\n\nYou could have phrased it more delicately but you weren\u2019t wrong for denying her.", "NTA. That lady needs help.

And at only 4 weeks postpartum your husband should be shielding you from any unwanted family or guests.. and for that reason I don\u2019t believe you\u2019re the AH despite your harsh words.\n\nBut Jackie doesn\u2019t seem to be a real problem here. So maybe your husband can smooth things over with her and you\u2018ll want to revisit the outright ban on her visits and assistance in the future.\n\nGet some rest mama!", "NTA.", "NTA take no for an answer the first time. Yes you had a harsh reaction but tension are high. Speak to your husband how she should have stopped and no mother likes others calling their child.", "I'm offended that you are using her weight as a reason she can't hold your newborn.\n\nYou are NTA foe not allowing her to hold your child, but you were kind of harsh.", "NTA. Your sister needs professional help and you are right for setting your boundaries.", "I'm going with NAH.\n\nYour SIL sounds like her behavior towards your child isn't because she's an asshole, but because of her mental health.\n\nAt the same time you have no reason to let her care for your daughter.

Yes, BUT you she deserve.\nThese is your baby, not hers.\nShe have no rigth to him, and she need to respect your boundaries with your baby. \nShe only is putins stress on you, and now you need to rest, recovery and createt a bond your your child. \nShe is triyn to put herself in the way and pretend your baby is hers.", "NTA\n\nMultiple NOs didn't work, so she needed a wake up call.", "saying that stuff was out of line, for sure. she wants to be a mom and she can't. you're right that it isn't your fault and you had a right to be angry. she can't use it as a reason to act against your wishes. but rubbing it in her face is never going to be okay. \n\nshe's your husband's sister. she loves your daughter and wants to be a hands-on aunt, which is great. i assume you want them to have a good relationship, especially if she lives close by. but she needs to learn some serious boundaries, and it sounds like she has a habit of not listening. maybe since this happened you or your husband can sit down with her or call her and have a real talk about what's okay and what's not, if she wants to be able to see your daughter. you get to make the rules and she needs to know that and respect them.", "NTA\n\nTrying to grab an infant against the parents' wishes is a red flag parade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"I just need my baby fix since I can't have babies\"\n\nThis woman looks seriously disturbed.\n\nNewborns are not a medicine for her to \"cure\" her need to have children. Yes, it's tragic that she can't have babies, but she doesn't have to be your newborn to pay the price.\n\nSit your husband down and explain why you spoke to his sister like that.

This sounds like it may be more than just your SIL. You are healing, the baby is very young, and you need your space. That's really at the core of things. Your husband needs to manage your SIL and establish boundaries. It would benefit everyone if you can establish boundaries, get through the new born stage and get out on the other side without family drama. You shouldn't be put in a position where you are taking a defensive posture and being pushed around by your SIL. But when she gets pushy, you need to communicate what's really at hand. You are a new mother, the baby is very fragile, you aren't sleeping, and it's not a great time to be taking other people's opinions and problems into account. \n\nNow beyond banning your SIL and taking a cheap shot at her infertility. Your husband and SIL both suck. Make sure you are are communicating your position, establishing what you what, and seeking a resolution. Such as: I'm not welcome to most visitors right now, being a new mother is stressful, I need to feel safe in my home, and I need to feel heard. I want to wait until we are further along before we open up our home. Once the baby is stronger, and has some neck strength you will be more open to your SIL and finding a way to include her. You need to voice your position and try not to be rude or hurtful. You can communicate clearly and firmly without attacking your SIL.", "NTA - Some people don't LISTEN unless you explain it CLEARLY to them.

While you provided examples of why her attempting to take care of your child bothers you, the fact of the matter is you don't have to justify your decision to anyone. \"No\" is a complete sentence.  SIL sounds like she needs major help, in more ways than no, and it is not you, your husband or your newborns responsibility to help her work through her issues. I think you snapping, while harsh, yes, is understandable.

What's worse is that she is trying to be overbearing about your newborn. That's the parents' job. I'd say given your situation your reaction was appropriate because telling her \"no\" wasn't enough.

She openly tells the story. I've heard it several times and the story never changes.\n\nAs for her weight, no, wrong again. She loves her weight. She said it gives her more character and she would rather be fat and happy than skinny and miserable \"like me\". She has always judged me for being on the skinner end and has tried multiple times to push food on me because she thinks I'm only worried about being skinny because IM mentally ill and care only about impressing people. She skinny shames everyone. She has been given multiple opportunities for weight loss surgery and she refuses to take them because she's happy.", "She wasn't taken advantage of. She slept around, got an STD and refused to treat it, spreading it to others.", "Uh, SIL was the one who brought but not being able to have babies in the first place, as a justification for her overbearing behavior and overstepping of boundaries, even when she was told no multiple times. It\u2019s not like OP brought it up out of nowhere or said \u201cit\u2019s your fault you can\u2019t have babies\u201d.

If SIL had more accountability maybe she wouldn't feel the need to say things like \" I just need my baby fix\". SIL should not be looking at other people to fix herself.

Idk where they belong from but there's close in age exemption.

Tough Love is necessary sometimes and the truth can hurt.", "why are you so hell bent on supporting the SIL.\nFirst you made a story about how she was sexually assaulted. Now you're making a story about her trauma.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, the SIL didn't listen to the OP or her husband when told nicely, she crossed boundaries many times, even when she was warned. Anyone would lose their patience. The SIL is self centred and making lives miserable for others.", "Her parents are dead. And even if they weren't, you can't fix someone who doesn't think they have a problem. As I said, she happily admits that her weight is perfect. She happily admits to pushing that STD around as a young girl. Her parents got her the medications. Her parents are the only reason she knew she even had Chlamydia. She would take the medications and continued to refuse medications until well after the point of being sterilized. She was a troubled teen who was pissed off at daddy for remarrying and rebelled. The only thing she regrets is letting that STD go on for long enough to sterilize her.", "Tough love is \u201cI told you no.

That make zero sense. You deserve a metal for these mental gymnastics."]}
