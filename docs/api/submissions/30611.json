We did everything together. We owned a smoothie shop together. We have closed it down, I wanted to be a stay at home mother and my ex went to become a electrician. \n\nI have a really good relationship with his family and his family consist of two sisters, Ollie (34F) Riley (30F) one brother Kane (27M), grandmother (75F) and the siblings partners Ollie\u2019s partner Mason (35M), Riley\u2019s partner Samson (30M) and Kane\u2019s partner Hazel (23F). They all have kids as well. Ollie and Manson\u2019s they both have daughters from a previous relationship both 10F and have a 7 month old daughter. Riley and Samson have a 7F and 3M and Kane and Hazel have 2M. \n\nNow I was always close to everyone except for Hazel. She\u2019s very quiet and usually keeps to herself. She\u2019s good with the kids. She and I don\u2019t really talk that much. She\u2019s a very attractive girl and always have people looking at her. She\u2019s very close to everyone, and is very nice to me. The reason we are divorcing is because I saw Jack\u2019s phone. He was messaging other women and sexting with them and sending nudes. \n\nHe didn\u2019t physically cheated but still cheated and I saw him sending text messages to his group chat with his friends. And he texted that if \u201che wasn\u2019t married and would try to pursue Hazel\u201d how she is super curvy, that he considered that his favorite thing about her.\u201d \u201cShe has natural breast\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s the prettiest girl ever\u201d he proceeds to text very graphic things he would do to her and never wanted to do with me. \n\nI confronted him and he tried to denied and say he was drunk. He was very apologetic and wanted to do couple counseling. I rejected that and went for a divorce. I posted on FB that I was going through a divorce. Many of my friends contacted me and was there for me. Ollie and Riley sent me comforting messages. Mason and Samson soon followed as well. \n\nI also received one from Kane and Hazel. I got upset when Hazel sent me one and I blew up on her. Telling her to mind her business and she was the reason Jack and I were divorcing. I told her I hated her and never to be near my children again and to not flirt with Jack. She didn\u2019t respond but left me on read. I got a message from Kane telling me to fuck off and that I was out of line and that Hazel has never flirted or have any desire to sleep with Jack. Nor is she a cheating pervert like Jack and that I need to keep Jack on a hook and leave both of them the fuck alone. He did blocked me after I sent the screenshot and so did Hazel. \n\nEveryone in the family have been very strict with me now. Riley messaged me that I was cold hearted and that it was Jack who caused the divorce for being a pervert and a creep. \n\nI would have thought they be on my side, as I was in the family much longer than Hazel.

Besides, if he hadn\u2019t been lusting after her, there always would\u2019ve been someone else. I also sincerely hope these are all fake names because jeez that\u2019s a lot of unnecessary info.\n\nETA Hazel is also a victim here.

I'm sure she was asking for it, just like all women always are...right?  By that same flawed logic though you got what you deserved...but that's not true and neither is she anything but another victim. I get you're hurt and not thinking entirely rational; your feelings are getting ahead of you...take some time, realize the ONLY bad guy in this was your husband.

Suppose your husband instead fixated on Taylor Swift. Substitute \"Taylor Swift\" for \"Hazel\" in his messages.

You felt really hurt and upset, and that's completely normal. But it seems that the way things went with Hazel might have been a bit tough for her. Maybe she wasn't a part of what went wrong in your marriage. She reached out to you with a message, and while your reaction was understandable because you were feeling really hurt, it might have made things harder.\r It could be good to reach out and say sorry for what you said, explain why you were so upset, and let her know that your feelings were not because of her.

No, you just lashed out at her when she was trying to comfort you. I get you're dealing with a lot and it's easier to blame someone you don't know well than face the fact that someone you cared so deeply for was willing to be so callous with your trust and your feelings. But that doesn't mean you get to lash out at a woman who as far as you know, has done nothing to you.\n\nHazel didn't ruin your marriage. Your husband did. She's not a secret siren out to destroy you and lure your poor unsuspecting hubby who had no free will of his own into her pants. You currently have no actual reason to think she had anything whatsoever to do with the fact that he cheated. She wasn't even the other woman!! He chose to be a creep and perv on a totally separate woman who as far as we know, had no knowledge of this. And honestly, even if you had been lashing out at the woman he cheated with, that still wouldn't absolve him of responsibility. He's a grown adult, he can control himself. And that means facing that what he did to you was a choice, and he is not the person you thought he was.\n\nAnd I know that that's what you don't want to face and why it's easier, especially in the moment to make someone else you're not attached to the problem. But that doesn't excuse it. Kane was right, you need to keep the blame where it belongs, your husband. Riley was also right. It's not about who's in the family longer. Its about how in the heat of the moment you lashed out at someone who didn't deserve it, pure and simple, and your family can see that even if you can't. You fucked up.\n\nJust take some time to cool down, then apologize and try to swallow your pride and reach out to the rest of the family while you still have them. You may be hurting and it may be hard, but please don't burn these bridges, you'll regret it later.", "YTA how dare you blame a woman who did nothing for your shitty husband's behavior, that's disgusting and you owe her an apology.", "YTA.

She deserved a medal for not replying to your horrid message.", "Soft YTA\n\nhow could you be mad at hazel when Jack wrote all the Stuff about her.
