We did everything together. We owned a smoothie shop together. We have closed it down, I wanted to be a stay at home mother and my ex went to become a electrician. \n\nI have a really good relationship with his family and his family consist of two sisters, Ollie (34F) Riley (30F) one brother Kane (27M), grandmother (75F) and the siblings partners Ollie\u2019s partner Mason (35M), Riley\u2019s partner Samson (30M) and Kane\u2019s partner Hazel (23F). They all have kids as well. Ollie and Manson\u2019s they both have daughters from a previous relationship both 10F and have a 7 month old daughter. Riley and Samson have a 7F and 3M and Kane and Hazel have 2M. \n\nNow I was always close to everyone except for Hazel. She\u2019s very quiet and usually keeps to herself. She\u2019s good with the kids. She and I don\u2019t really talk that much. She\u2019s a very attractive girl and always have people looking at her. She\u2019s very close to everyone, and is very nice to me. The reason we are divorcing is because I saw Jack\u2019s phone. He was messaging other women and sexting with them and sending nudes. \n\nHe didn\u2019t physically cheated but still cheated and I saw him sending text messages to his group chat with his friends. And he texted that if \u201che wasn\u2019t married and would try to pursue Hazel\u201d how she is super curvy, that he considered that his favorite thing about her.\u201d \u201cShe has natural breast\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s the prettiest girl ever\u201d he proceeds to text very graphic things he would do to her and never wanted to do with me. \n\nI confronted him and he tried to denied and say he was drunk. He was very apologetic and wanted to do couple counseling. I rejected that and went for a divorce. I posted on FB that I was going through a divorce. Many of my friends contacted me and was there for me. Ollie and Riley sent me comforting messages. Mason and Samson soon followed as well. \n\nI also received one from Kane and Hazel. I got upset when Hazel sent me one and I blew up on her. Telling her to mind her business and she was the reason Jack and I were divorcing. I told her I hated her and never to be near my children again and to not flirt with Jack. She didn\u2019t respond but left me on read. I got a message from Kane telling me to fuck off and that I was out of line and that Hazel has never flirted or have any desire to sleep with Jack. Nor is she a cheating pervert like Jack and that I need to keep Jack on a hook and leave both of them the fuck alone. He did blocked me after I sent the screenshot and so did Hazel. \n\nEveryone in the family have been very strict with me now. Riley messaged me that I was cold hearted and that it was Jack who caused the divorce for being a pervert and a creep. \n\nI would have thought they be on my side, as I was in the family much longer than Hazel.

Besides, if he hadn\u2019t been lusting after her, there always would\u2019ve been someone else. I also sincerely hope these are all fake names because jeez that\u2019s a lot of unnecessary info.\n\nETA Hazel is also a victim here.

I'm sure she was asking for it, just like all women always are...right?  By that same flawed logic though you got what you deserved...but that's not true and neither is she anything but another victim. I get you're hurt and not thinking entirely rational; your feelings are getting ahead of you...take some time, realize the ONLY bad guy in this was your husband.

Suppose your husband instead fixated on Taylor Swift. Substitute \"Taylor Swift\" for \"Hazel\" in his messages.

She\u2019s very close to everyone, and is very nice to me. The reason we are divorcing is because I saw Jack\u2019s phone.

No, you just lashed out at her when she was trying to comfort you. I get you're dealing with a lot and it's easier to blame someone you don't know well than face the fact that someone you cared so deeply for was willing to be so callous with your trust and your feelings. But that doesn't mean you get to lash out at a woman who as far as you know, has done nothing to you.\n\nHazel didn't ruin your marriage. Your husband did. She's not a secret siren out to destroy you and lure your poor unsuspecting hubby who had no free will of his own into her pants. You currently have no actual reason to think she had anything whatsoever to do with the fact that he cheated. She wasn't even the other woman!! He chose to be a creep and perv on a totally separate woman who as far as we know, had no knowledge of this. And honestly, even if you had been lashing out at the woman he cheated with, that still wouldn't absolve him of responsibility. He's a grown adult, he can control himself. And that means facing that what he did to you was a choice, and he is not the person you thought he was.\n\nAnd I know that that's what you don't want to face and why it's easier, especially in the moment to make someone else you're not attached to the problem. But that doesn't excuse it. Kane was right, you need to keep the blame where it belongs, your husband. Riley was also right. It's not about who's in the family longer. Its about how in the heat of the moment you lashed out at someone who didn't deserve it, pure and simple, and your family can see that even if you can't. You fucked up.\n\nJust take some time to cool down, then apologize and try to swallow your pride and reach out to the rest of the family while you still have them.

I think it's projection here. \n\nI commend you though that you divorced Jack because of that. I would consider Emotional cheating to be worse than physical cheating. I mean every time hazel and Jack would be together at a family outing or else, I would always have a weird feeling about it and look for Jack if he is looking at Hazel and watch how he behaves around her.\n\nSoft YTA because I think you are currently in a distressed state and lashed out because your emotions about Jack and the divorce are troubled.\n\nTake your time, stay away from his family for a while and after you cleared your thoughts reach out and apologize to everyone for it.\n\nJack is the bad guy here.", "YTA Hazel did nothing how is she to blame? She is pretty and your ex husband is a perv none of that is Hazel\u2019s fault. You can\u2019t blame her the only person to blame is your husband", "YTA\n\nJack alone is to blame for his actions. He chose to message other women. He not only betrayed you by speaking about Hazel in this manner, but he also betrayed his brother and Hazel. She did nothing to encourage Jack. Your insecurities and his sexual attraction are not her fault. The only person to blame is Jack. \n\nYou owe Hazel and Kane a massive apology.", "Big fat YTA. Also I see no response from OP. Seems like she did not like the response from everyone.", "Exactly what did she wrong? She sent out a message of support? \n\nNothing was her fault, it was all your husband's fault and you took it out on her. I fail to understand how you could think you are not TA here. \n\nAbsolutely YTA", "YTA", "YTA, you sound like you are insanely insecure and unjustly jealous of Hazel. You said shes nice and good with the kids, that you never had any reason to not get along with her other than she is quiet. You would be less TAH if you lashed out at a poodle, at least then you would have the pass of being crazy. Apologize to Hazel, publicly. Then apologize to her and her husband PRIVATELY. \n\nYOUR HUSBAND DID THIS. \n\nDid you also go through his phone and text all the other women he was sexting that they ruined your marriage?\n\nDid you publicly Put his friends and their partners on blast?\n\nBecause by your logic they are all equally to blame as well.", "YTA", "YTA. I can't believe you wrote that post and still need to ask this. Your husband writes gross things about his SIL and you attack her for existing. Wtf! Your husband broke your marriage because he was a perv and a creep and you've just destroyed what was a support network. They most likely will stay in touch with your children but you've burnt your bridges, I suggest you start to apologise starting with your SIL", "YTA - your husband cheated. Emotionally, physically - it doesn't matter. \n\nNot Hazel, not anyone else. \n\nThe only person you can pin this on is him and it is entirely unreasonable to try to blame it on a girl who is *completely* uninvolved. You are literally burning bridges with people who were trying to be kind and empathetic.", "YTA. Hazel didn't do anything. Your husband did things. You are being irrational.", "YTA  HE is the one who cheated.  Not Hazel.  You are way out of line and owe each and everyone one of them an apology\u2026especially Hazel.", "Of course YTA. She had nothing to do with your ex's cheating. I feel very sorry for her, having to deal with you. Put the blame squarely where it belongs - on Jack.", "YTA. Hazel has nothing to do with this, and if anything is a victim herself for being grossly objectified by her own brother-in-law.\nStop projecting your anger, focus on your divorce, and work on yourself.", "YTA\n\nI don\u2019t know how you could write that and think you were in the right here. Your ex is the problem. Hazel had nothing to do with it. Grow up, you\u2019re acting like an insecure teenager with her first boyfriend.", "Unanimously YTA.", "YTA Hazel did nothing other than exist. Please say sorry.", "Yta! She did nothing but be objectified unbeknownst to her by her brother in law, you need to lay the blame where it belongs with your soon to be ex husband.", "YTA, I get that yourbhurt but Hazel didntndeserve that and when you find some humility, you should apologize to her.", "Oh girl, you screwed up. Eeek.", "YTA\n\nYou blame Hazel for no fault of hers.\n\nAlthough your husband is a prick for having affection for other women whilst married, he was ready to change and do counselling.\n\nThe whole post makes it seem like you were just waiting for a scene to get out of the marriage and create drama.\n\nYTA and the only one in this scenario.", "YTA\n\nThey were on your side until you blew up at someone who didn\u2019t do anything. You admitted she kept to herself mostly so when exactly did she have time to flirt with your husband? Also, don\u2019t you know your husband has been in the family longer than both of you and they were willing to go against him. If they went against the brother they\u2019ve known all their life to support you, why would you think time in the family mattered when it came to you and Hazel. Apologize and hope they forgive you.", "YTA Hazel didn\u2019t do anything and it\u2019s not her fault your husband is a dog.", "Yta for how you treated her AND for refusing therapy. I really don\u2019t care the story, I firmly believe the person who refuses therapy is the problem.", "How is this Hazel\u2019s fault? For existing\u2026? YTA, sorry what\u2019s happening but projecting on to someone reaching out in support is ugly", "Yup you are the A/H. You owe them an apology. Your husband is an A/H too. You know Hazel are just upset because your husband wishes to be with his SIL. You could have possibly ruined Mason and Hazel's relationship too with your jealousy. You could have put a wedge between your husband and his family because of your jealous behavior. You could have left it at his sexting other women. You should have never dragged Hazel in on your anger. She more than likely never knew about her BIL lusting after her... You now made the family dynamic weird for them. Shame on you. You are a HUGE GIANT AH. No question about it.", "YTA, Hazel is guilty of existing and being a decent human being, even to people that don\u2019t deserve it, like you and your husband. Blame the dude that owes you loyalty, not an innocent bystander.", "Hazel has no control over what people think about her attractiveness. Why blame her for what your soon to be ex-husband did? YTA. You might need to work on your insecurities, and I'm not saying this as a jab at you.", "Unless Jack was texting *with* Hazel and not just *about* Hazel, YtA. She did nothing wrong.", "YTA\nThat was a major asshole move on your part. This is similar to victim blaming. How is it Hazel's fault that your husband is a perv?", "Right?  Poor Hazel.  Her BIL is a gross creepo and she\u2019s catching heat for it.", "In the op she said he tried for marriage counseling and she refused."]}
