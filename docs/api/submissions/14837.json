(If no, why not?)", "I'm gonna buck the trend and say YTA. Your sister is 100% right. In the absence of any prior issues between you two (you don't mention any), it is rather heartless for you to leave your own sister helpless in this situation. Yes, it will require sacrifices on your end and yes, the living situation is gonna be a bit unbearable. But she's your sister, it is her time of darkest need, and she's asking you as a brother to show some compassion. If the roles were reversed and you needed the help, you would be extremely grateful to have such a safety net.\n\nPut yourself in her shoes for a minute. Really really think about it. She's being thrown out of her house pregnant, and needs to find shelter asap. What are her choices? How desperate is her need? What can you be doing to ease her suffering?\n\nI know Reddit has this fetish about everyone being independent and responsible for their own consequences in life (and autonomy on whether to help others or not). And somehow seems very much anti-family. But, there's a time and a place when you need to put your own needs aside and help others for the greater good. This is one of those times, and you have the power to make a meaningful and lasting difference in your sister's life right now, and choosing not to for the sake of your convenience.\n\nI welcome the downvotes.", "NTA\n\nAlthough she is family, you ultimately have to look out for yourself and take your own well being into account. There are many ways that you can help her, without allowing her to move in with you. Try to come up with ways that you can offer support without putting yourself under undue amounts of stress.", "Not enough info, but I am leaning towards YTA.\n\nIf my sister was pregnant, and going through a messy divorce, I'd fucking make room for her, AND her two teenagers. Her smelly cats though, would have to go somewhere else as my cat would never accept them. Yes my house is already full, my partner and I already have 3 existing kids. But y'know, sofas exist, and so do blow up beds, furniture can be re arranged and moved to optimise places to sleep.\n\nAll that matters is knowing she is SAFE. We're not even that close, but fuck if something happened to her because I refused to help her whilst she was really vulnerable, I'd never forgive myself.", "INFO\nWhy do they break up? In case of violence/abuse: Then I would help her. Otherwise she is an adult and have to find any other longterm solution.", "NTA\n\nNo parents available to assist? She moves in, she will nest and not move out. Will also expect free baby sitting from you.\n\nSorry just the way I have seen things in the past.", "YTA. Yes, you should help your sister.", "NTA. She should seek help from her ex given tt she is pregnant with his child.\n\nBut you can try to help her as much financially as you can, if you wish to help. But you dont have to invite her into your home. Home is our sanctuary.", "She's trying to guilt you and insult you into helping her. I really wouldn't want to share an apartment with someone with those entitled character traits.\n\nNTA\n\nDon't you have any other family members who do have the space to help her out?", "NTA, you can help her out with some money and probably try to help find her some accommodation if you can, but you dont have to necessarily lose your personal space and privacy. \nIts sad what she is going through,  but you are not the one who put her in that position.", "Info: do you have a spare room?  If so then YTA.\n\nIf not then NAH.\n\nWhen my brother broke up with his long term partner the first thing we did was offer him AND his son a place to live until he could get things sorted.\n\nThere's nothing stopping you imposing boundaries.  House rules/time limit for the stay etc.  But not being there for your sister unless there's prior history of her being a dick is just an asshole move.", "YTA. Even just offering her to stay a few weeks/months until she finds her own place is too much for you? She wants somewhere to get on to her feet, that does not mean she wants to live with you permanently and raise a child in your apartment.  \n\nShe is your sister, yes you should have boundaries and limitations but not helping her out for even a little bit is selfish. This will probably ruin your relationship with her and she won't help you when you need it.", "\ud83d\ude44 Oh, the classic \"family should always help each other out\" guilt trip. Let me guess, she conveniently forgot about all the times you helped her out in the past or just took you for granted?\r  \n\r  \nYou're not the asshole here. It's not like you're refusing to help her altogether, you just can't accommodate her in your small apartment. It's perfectly reasonable for you to prioritize your own needs and limitations. And let's be real, having a pregnant woman and a new baby in a small apartment can be a logistical nightmare, even if you wanted to help her out.\r  \n\r  \nYour sister needs to take responsibility for her own problems and find other solutions. It's not your job to fix everything for her. Don't let her guilt-trip you into feeling like you're the bad guy. Stand your ground and set your boundaries. It's better to be honest upfront than to create a bigger mess down the line.\r  \n\r  \nGood luck with everything! \ud83d\ude12", "NTA\n\nYou already said you have a small apartment. Can you imagine how much smaller it will be with an extra woman and baby?\n\nAnd it is never, never, NEVER wrong to take care of yourself.", "NTA\nYes, family should help family but within reason. You should not sabotage your own wellbeing to help others. Anyone demanding help for the sake of family fully knowing they will burden others is just selfish. Asking is okay but she can't get mad if you say no.", "NTA. You know very well that she won't be \"back on her feet\" for 20 years and she will never move out and you will be expected to co-parent with her.", "Info: will you be willing to put up with them for say five years? Or able to ask her AND a small child to leave at some point? If the answer to any of those is no, then stick to your guns now before it becomes an even bigger burden for you.", "NTA. Tell her you\u2019ll help her in any way you reasonably can, but this just isn\u2019t reasonable. You don\u2019t have the space to accommodate her. That is a fact that you don\u2019t have the means to change at this time.", "NTA", "Can you provide  aid for her to live in a hotel  for a bit?

It's a substantial inconvenience, but sister's situation seems quite desperate.", "Agree. Although OP doesn\u2019t have the room for her, this is likely to be a temporary situation until she is able to get back on her feet and not a permanent living situation. OP could even help his sister out for a very short period of time by giving her a place to stay for a few weeks until she can find someone who can help her figure out a longer term solution.

There are no legal requirements for you to house your sister. Morally though, how could you not? Providing you have a decent relationship and love her, you would be a big AH to watch your pregnant sister become homeless and do nothing when you have the ability to help. \n\nIt will suck, be overcrowded, uncomfortable and you\u2019ll drive each other mad, but any decent person would find all that preferable to allowing their pregnant sister to become homeless. \n\nReddit sometimes makes me worry for the world. Whilst people have no obligation to abusers, family or not, it can be shocking how people react to helping those they supposedly care about. \n\nIn this case, OP should find the idea of her pregnant sister (who she loves and cares about), being homeless so abhorrent that it would be unthinkable to NOT offer up her house. Instead, OP goes online and asks strangers if she\u2019d look bad if she didn\u2019t.
