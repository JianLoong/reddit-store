Yes, it will require sacrifices on your end and yes, the living situation is gonna be a bit unbearable.

If the roles were reversed and you needed the help, you would be extremely grateful to have such a safety net.\n\nPut yourself in her shoes for a minute. Really really think about it. She's being thrown out of her house pregnant, and needs to find shelter asap. What are her choices? How desperate is her need? What can you be doing to ease her suffering?\n\nI know Reddit has this fetish about everyone being independent and responsible for their own consequences in life (and autonomy on whether to help others or not). And somehow seems very much anti-family. But, there's a time and a place when you need to put your own needs aside and help others for the greater good.
