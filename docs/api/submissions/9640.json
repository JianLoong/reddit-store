My wife would never want anyone to see her breastfeeding so we never had to have this conversation, but I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with her sitting next to a large window that neighbors or folks passing by could see. The main reason for that would be my worry (I guess it's unrational?) about her and the babies safety. I don't pretend to know what kind of crazy length's perverts will go to but I hear and read all the horror stories in the news and that would be enough to make me take every precaution.\n\nThe other part I don't get is the argument about it being a biological purpose. While I agree that breast feeding is the biological purpose of the body part, a naked breast is still something that society, as a whole, sexualizes. There are other parts that have certain biological purposes that we would not walk around in public without covering because they are also sexualized.\n\nIs feeding time not a beautiful moment between mother and child? I don't understand the desire to open that moment to others who may have very devious intentions.\n\nIt sounds to me like OP is just tired of worrying about everyone else and I wouldn't blame her one bit for that.

It is the sexualisation of breasts that\u2019s the problem.", "NTA OP but if it was me, I would tell him \"Close those blinds one mo' agin' and I will pull those b\\*\\*ches down\" and I would follow through if he close them.  Sometimes a woman have to let out the Amazon warrior w/ little Ghetto thrown in to advocate for herself and the agency of her body.", "There\u2019s to be ashamed of at all. But it is true that there are people who creepily sexualize and fetishize breast feeding. You should be free to breast feed comfortably but I do understand your husband being protective. I personally don\u2019t like feeling that anyone can look into my windows at any time and am a little obsessive about my privacy though. I am going to say that NAH.", "I may be jaded from my work in the medical field but \u2026boobs aren\u2019t all that interesting after a while.  Don\u2019t get me wrong!  I enjoy my access to that which is provided to me without reserve\u2026but watching mothers nurse?  Really?  Is that even a thing?  \n\nI thought this was a beautiful and amazing thing when my wife was feeding our child.  I was mesmerized by the love that it took for her to be mother, feeding station, maid, cleaner, nurse, emotional support counselor, nap time coordinator etc\u2026 my wife constantly has amazed me over our 40 years together\u2026but \u2018protecting her\u2019 while safely indoors nursing seems a bit too far over the line for most guys.  \n\nTell him that medically you need the sunlight while nursing for emotional and physical well being.  That it \u2018just feels dark\u2019 when the curtains are drawn. (No BS\u2026this is a thing).  Explain to him that it is essential for the baby to adapt and be kept awake while feeding in the daylight so that he/she acquires proper nutrition and doesn\u2019t drop off before getting sufficient \u2019milk\u2019.  These are real things. Daylight is an essential thing to stimulate the production of vitamin D3 which helps keep us from depression and anxiety and stress.  By closing the blinds he is creating a stressful environment for you and the child.\n\nOn the other hand have a little patience.  Young husbands are protective to a fault.  They have unreasonable expectations of how the world should work to entertain, protect and revolve around them.  i did it\u2026he\u2019s doing it\u2026it\u2019s a young husband thing.  We\u2019re a bunch of helpless fools and only some of us are able to not be helpless fools as time goes by and we realize that our wife and child is the center of our universe\u2026NOT US!  This is not about HIS comfort\u2026it\u2019s about your comfort and that of the child.  Ask him to go make tea while you are nursing\u2026just keep doing it to get him off his worry cycle.  Maybe throw a load of laundry into the drier 40 minutes before you start nursing so that he has to go empty the drier and fold stuff before they wrinkle (whether they will wrinkle or not).  Have small tasks that are reasonable and that he knows need to be done when you ask, at the ready to send him from the room a couple times to interrupt his worry obsession.  He\u2019s not being weird\u2026it\u2019s actually pretty normal.  It\u2019s not even prudish\u2026it\u2019s just that you and the child are the center of his universe right now and that\u2019s a pretty taxing thing (ON YOU).\n\nYNTA-just adjust his expectations by keeping him busy when you are nursing.", "NAH - If there is even a 1% chance of something bad happening and you can prevent it with minimal or reasonable effort you should.", "NTA.  I'd be inclined to rip the blinds down!  When he goes for the blinds use your meanest voice and tell him not to touch the blinds and you're not kidding about it.  You are not doing something vulgar and even if you were you are indoors in your own living room.  \nYou need to let him know that you are serious about this.  Tell him to go outside and look to see if he can see anything so he understands that there's nothing to see!", "From my understanding the current scientific consensus is that mammals developed permanently enlarged breasts to encourage males to have sex from the front rather than the back, which more often led to anal sex.  \n\nIn many other mammals breasts are only prominent after giving birth.

Anyone who looks in can only see her back.  Husband is crazy.", "1.  She spends *much* more time breastfeeding the baby every day than you do drying off after your shower.\n\n2.  Given that she spends so much time breastfeeding the baby, she's entitled to enjoy the sunlight while she does so, if that's what she wants.\n\n3.  In OP's case, it's impossible for anyone to see her boobs anyway since her back faces the window when she's breastfeeding, so husband is being completely irrational.\n\n4.

The C word is not allowed here!!!", "The husband does not have a valid point!", "Most people in the US don't sexualize feeding a child.  Very, very, very few would be so weird as to close the blinds of a window that's *behind* a breastfeeding woman, in her own home.  Even if someone did look in, they would only see her back.", "Can we just tell OP to tell her husband that there's way easier ways to see boobs than the way she described. Like the effort to try and snipe a glance at some possible boob. What person with fucking access to the internet would bother with it, go on instagram, lots of varying amounts of boob on there. Hell just watch a bunch of trap rap songs by anyone not named Lil Nas X and you'll get to see some scantily clad women dancing and twerking. The list of: Ways to see Boobs could continue for like 1000 bullet points before \"Looking down into your neighbors window from the second story of your house when she's breastfeeding, with her back to the window.\" It'd be right above, \"Purchasing a trampoline to steal a glance at your topless tanning neighbor over a fence\" Maybe it's just me but I feel like this would be the easiest way to turn off the \"Less Logical\" part of his brain.", ">No one is allowed to see his wife's breasts but him and the kiddo.\n\nThat sounds so weird to me.. I wouldn't want anyone else seeing my tits, either.  Breastfeeding is normal and healthy, but I'd be closing the blinds, too.  Personal isn't the same thing as shameful.", ">He can go run laps and patrol the perimeter of the lot.

I can see why it might make you uncomfortable.", "I actually kind of understand being uncomfortable, because it\u2019s so uncommon to see (in the U.S. at least). I was very taken aback the first time I saw someone latch her baby on in front of me (not in public but a large extended family gathering). I was like, \u201cwhoa, didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be seeing my cousin\u2019s wife\u2019s nipple today!\u201d And you know what I did? Nothing. I sat there and continued talking to her and got the hell over it. Then years later, when I was breastfeeding, I appreciated that she had made it more normal to me. \n\nIf you cannot get over being uncomfortable seeing a baby eat in public, you are very welcome to put a cover over your head.\n\nAlso: \u201cyoung kids\u201d are probably the least likely group to be made uncomfortable by this, so please don\u2019t use them as an excuse for your own discomfort.", "Because vilifying him is so satisfying.", "There's no way in hell id believe he wasn't a part of it.", "Tell yourself that", "Especially in the summer it was no cover, who needs that.

It's amazing I survived such titillation.", "I actually dry off before I leave the bathroom.  Walkin' around nekked is, if I had to put a label on it, a form of procrastination.\n\nPoint 4 is the one that makes the most sense, but doesnt help me understand why he/she cares so much, unless they're both just trying to flex on the other.  Seems like an exhausting relationship to me.  But I guess that's why I gotta come here to get my drama.", "Care to explain that conclusion?", "Lol yeah.  Hubby needs to move into this century!  His calling it primitive is absolutely ridiculous... I'm pretty sure \"primitive\" women or their men didn't give two fucks about hiding/covering up when it was time to nurse a baby.", "this", "The point of (most) relationships is exclusivity, with each partner agreeing to not go around dating/fucking/flirting/whatever they aren't comfortable with other people; those are actions that are only to be performed with your SO. \n\n\nA large part of that exclusivity is intimacy, and how much of that intimacy the couple is comfortable sharing with others. Breasts are a very intimate part of a woman's body in most cultures, including our own. As such, a woman in a relationship letting other people seeing her breasts absolutely erodes the exculsivity of the relationship by displaying a certain level of intimacy with other men, and if the other partner is not with lowering the relationship's level of exclusivity, that becomes a large issue for the couple.\n\n\nOP, despite her being allegedly modest/shy, clearly is ok with (potentially) sharing a level of intimacy that her partner is clearly uncomfortable with, and from his point of view, somewhat devalues the exclusivity of their marriage.", "I completely agree with this! The probability of anyone wanting to go through this to see a small bit of boob from a distance seems extremely low to begin with.

You WANT to put the blinds down, so you don\u2019t feel shamed in doing so. OP doesn\u2019t. OP is having a choice made FOR her, and it makes her uncomfortable.", "Ok but finding out someone has been looking at you and getting off while you sleep/live/exist is (in my opinion) more demoralizing than closing the windows. \n\nI had a reoccurring peeping Tom and it was horrifying. \n\nI don't know when it started! I don't know what he saw! I don't know who he even is!\n\nI had to change my behavior because catching a sneaky perv is not as easy as you make it out to be. Catching him on grainy video ONCE scared him off (hopefully) and the video I got didn't catch his face or anything identifiable. I had to draw my curtains after that, any time it got dark, they were up. I had to change my behavior because the reality is, there are creepy disgusting men out there. \n\nIt wasn't my fault it happened, but I sure as hell learned the hard way that creepy men will take any chance they can to get off. I hate that I had to learn this way! I hate that some guy is just existing out there who knows me that intimately without my consent. \n\nOp shouldn't be ashamed of breastfeeding, op shouldn't have to cover herself up, op shouldn't even have to think about the fact that there are peeping toms who will sexualize her feeding her child.

It\u2019s not about my body or my privacy. My wife is uncomfortably with it, and it\u2019s not worth pretending like some sort of egregious act is being forced upon me. The way you\u2019re trying to justify this is absurd.", "You\u2019ve shown your bias here. Why isn\u2019t it THEIR home? Also, my dude, you do realize that the one breastfeeding a child for hours a day has a MUCH harder time going to a different room to open her blinds, yes? He can go hang out in their bedroom with the blinds closed if it bothers him. (His lack of control over her body is what bothers him though\u2026)"]}
