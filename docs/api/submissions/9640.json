I guess I'm just an awful human being because this makes me really uncomfortable and concerned. My wife would never want anyone to see her breastfeeding so we never had to have this conversation, but I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with her sitting next to a large window that neighbors or folks passing by could see. The main reason for that would be my worry (I guess it's unrational?) about her and the babies safety. I don't pretend to know what kind of crazy length's perverts will go to but I hear and read all the horror stories in the news and that would be enough to make me take every precaution.\n\nThe other part I don't get is the argument about it being a biological purpose. While I agree that breast feeding is the biological purpose of the body part, a naked breast is still something that society, as a whole, sexualizes. There are other parts that have certain biological purposes that we would not walk around in public without covering because they are also sexualized.\n\nIs feeding time not a beautiful moment between mother and child? I don't understand the desire to open that moment to others who may have very devious intentions.\n\nIt sounds to me like OP is just tired of worrying about everyone else and I wouldn't blame her one bit for that.

I\u2019m a breastfeeding mom, and my husband and I would both be considered conservative. It was an adjustment for my husband to get used to the fact that my breasts were being used to feed out kids. (He shouldn\u2019t have to, but I suppose I can understand if you\u2019ve never even been around a breastfeeding mom before.) But in my own damn house?? These boobies are gonna be out.

NTA in any case.", "NTA\n\n> His brother and his brother\u2019s friend when growing up would sneak around to a neighbor\u2019s to get a view of her showering, and this was brought up as an example of how male behavior can be problematic and it\u2019s something that needs to be safeguarded against.\n\nNo, the person with the offending behavior should be corrected.\n\nHe\u2019s not safeguarding you, he\u2019s making other people\u2019s choices your responsibility and that\u2019s not okay.

I think your husband needs to just listen to you more.", "I think you\u2019re still dealing with some hormones there (I\u2019m a mother), I don\u2019t think he was doing it to hurt your feelings, more to be thoughtful and help in the ways he can. My husband would do the same thing and I honestly appreciated it. You don\u2019t need to be ashamed of breastfeeding, but him giving you privacy in your own home isn\u2019t bad either. What would make a difference if the blinds were open anyways, you can\u2019t see out of the window behind you. He\u2019s a new dad, figuring out his place and feeding your baby is considered a vulnerable spot to be in.

But I come from a family where my mom's breasts were always out, feeding one kid or another. (I'm the oldest of 14.) The thought of there being any shame attached to breast feeding is very foreign to me.", "NTA\n\n\nI would publicly breastfeed without a cover because my son would rip it off. \n\nTell your husband to eat under a blanket \ud83d\ude44", "NAH. He\u2019s being protective over you, when you become a father it happens.", "NTA and your husband's behavior is really gross. He doesn't own you or your breasts.

It\u2019s your home. It\u2019s your safe space. \n\nBreasts will be exposed while nursing. I refused a cover, it was too annoying and cumbersome and that shocked me because I expected to be more self conscious. But I wasn\u2019t.

From now on start turning off the lights and closing the curtains \u201cI\u2019m sorry honey, I\u2019m just trying to protect you - you never know what perv is lurking\u201d and take his food away\u2026 because that\u2019s what you have to do to your baby every time he closes the curtains and you have to readjust the lighting! \n\nJust because he and his brother are Perverts and went to peep on the neighbours doesn\u2019t mean ALL men/boys do. \n\nYou are in the privacy of home - You\u2019re free to do whatever you want.", "NTA.

You all have lots of lurking perverts up in your hood??", "You know with the sick assed people in the world there might just be some perv who knows when you're feeding and stand and watch and not for nothing I'd rather be safe then sorry. I guess that's just my way of thinking I'm a little bit paranoid..NTA", "If it\u2019s the kind of blinds that go horizontally, just pull them all the way down and then rotate/open them so they face up?

All the lots are two or more acres and most houses are surrounded by trees.  Our neighbor got in the habit of walking out on the deck off their master bedroom nude to spray tan.  There is a house far behind theirs but of course there's a driveway next to her house leading back to that house.  So one day she is doing her thing and got a round of applause.  She flattened down and crawled into the house lol. The neighbor was walking down his driveway.  She can't look him in the eye anymore!\n\nSo do what you want, but if you find a windowful of teenage boys eating popcorn at the house behind you don't blame your husband!", "Nobody is an asshole here, imo.

I mean, NAH I suppose. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s being an, \u201casshole\u201d by closing the blinds.

Cover up fully in public or get arrested for lewd behavior. Don\u2019t care if the baby is hungry. I\u2019m drinking coffee? Let me worry about how much milk is in it instead of breast milk.

That\u2019s just such an odd argument", "I get that he's coming from a protective place but the fact that he calls it primitive and illogical himself shows that he knows it's not a good thing on some level. He's basically exerting possession over your body which is really something you have to nip in the bud hard, not only for yourself, but because you have a child who shouldn't learn that.

I did something like that at a public pool shower, and I\u2019m female and straight. Kids are curious, and boys want to see boobies and sometimes need to have a little sense knocked into them. It\u2019s inappropriate, yes; problematic, perhaps; something I need someone protecting me from? Not really.
