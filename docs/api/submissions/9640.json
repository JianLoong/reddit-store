I\u2019d let it go and let your husband close the blinds, but that\u2019s way easier to say when I\u2019m not newly postpartum and sleep deprived. I", "Your man sucks.", "YTA", "Goodness. I guess I'm just an awful human being because this makes me really uncomfortable and concerned. My wife would never want anyone to see her breastfeeding so we never had to have this conversation, but I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with her sitting next to a large window that neighbors or folks passing by could see. The main reason for that would be my worry (I guess it's unrational?) about her and the babies safety. I don't pretend to know what kind of crazy length's perverts will go to but I hear and read all the horror stories in the news and that would be enough to make me take every precaution.\n\nThe other part I don't get is the argument about it being a biological purpose. While I agree that breast feeding is the biological purpose of the body part, a naked breast is still something that society, as a whole, sexualizes. There are other parts that have certain biological purposes that we would not walk around in public without covering because they are also sexualized.\n\nIs feeding time not a beautiful moment between mother and child? I don't understand the desire to open that moment to others who may have very devious intentions.\n\nIt sounds to me like OP is just tired of worrying about everyone else and I wouldn't blame her one bit for that. It can be exhausting. I also think the Husband is just trying to do a little bit of the worrying for her which I don't see as a problem either. \n\nCongrats OP on the baby!", "NTA, almost N A H.

OP can do whatever she wishes, but the husband also isn\u2019t wrong either.", "I completely disagree, there are creeps out there that can put OP and her family in danger. Giving them access to that directly puts the risk of stalkers or attackers a thousand times higher", "Exactly.  He can go run laps and patrol the perimeter of the lot.  Maybe pee in a few corners to alert the lurkers that there is a man there to protect his wife's breasts at all costs - especially to her freedom and dignity.\n\nThis deeply-ingrained toxic masculinity is WILD.", ">So... he gets sole jurisdiction over the blinds?\n\nRight?

She was an old-school, rather conservative woman so before I fed him I asked if it was OK I do it in the living room or if I should move to the bedroom. She said \"That's why God gave you those things -- you feed that baby whenever and wherever you want!\" From that day on, I did. No cover. I fed that kid on beaches, in restaurants, on stores, and once in the bed of a pickup truck in a Home Depot parking lot (my husband was still shopping, I forgot to get the keys from him, and baby was NOT going to wait). I figured if anyone gave me any crap I would give them my grandmother's phone number and they could take it up with her.", "> > He disagreed that I should have jurisdiction over the blinds staying up.\n\n> As long as he's not dictating your actions\n\nHe seems to be dictating OP's actions.", "It absolutely does impact her though?

Why is his masculinity more important than op\u2019s comfort? He can close the blinds when he\u2019s exposed", "It's not an opinion. He's sexualising breastfeeding. \nShe's at home feeding her child in peace and he's shutting her in in case some man walks by the window and stops to stare???\nHe's projecting what his brother did.", "He is doing something to her though. By shutting the blinds everytime she goes to breastfeed especially after she asked him to stop, he's sending a strong message that her performing a completely natural act must be hidden away from everyone else, and that she doesn't have the autonomy over her own body.", "I agree, except my judgement is either ESH or NAH. Probably in his mind he's giving her privacy because he knows how important it is given how he grew up, but OP is understanding that as \"he's saying I should be ashamed of my body! That I should be embarrassed!\" I understand where OP is coming from but I don't see how she doesn't care what her husband is saying. I do think the husband should let her do what she wants, but to say he's being \"creepy\" or \"prudish\" or \"sexualizing a non-sexual action\" is so far-fetched and stupid imo.", "[deleted]", "Your own living room is NOT in public.", "It\u2019s her own home, and he\u2019s not doing it out of care because op has expressed that she doesn\u2019t like how it makes her feel.
