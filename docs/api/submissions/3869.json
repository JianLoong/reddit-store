Never thought you\u2019d need to announce the rule of the only nipples in your babies mouth are yours", "NTA. Permission should be required for anyone but the mother to breastfeed", "NTA\n\nOH HELL TO THE FUCK NO.\n\nIf LO (little one) was fussy THEN YOU BRING THEM TO THE PARENTS. You don't whip out a titty and try to feed a basically strangers child! That is CSA! Keep causing trouble cause that's beyond unacceptable. Just NO.", "NTA. I\u2026 I\u2019m at a loss to put into words how inappropriate her actions were. The fact that she didn\u2019t even try to hide what she did speaks volumes about her judgement. \n\nLook after your little family, OP - don\u2019t give into the flying monkeys. And if they continue to harass you on her behalf, simply tell them to go suck a random nipple then come talk to you again.", "NTA - Her actions are unacceptable. It is not your problem to fix the '...major stress on the family by creating this rule.\"  Her actions created crazy stress. She was completely wrong no matter the rational.", "NTA\n\nI am pretty sure I\u2019d never speak to either your dad or step mom ever again. \n\nNot to go nuclear but this feels like SA.", "No, i think I\u2019d be quite disturbed as well. But i have to ask, is she currently breast feeding or has she stopped recently and she knows you breast feed? Or was she pulling out milkless nipples and popping them into mouths?", "NTA. Yo WTF. I've watched kids before and never even thought of letting them suck on my nipples when they get fussy. WTF", "NTA.  In your shoes, I would report this to the police.", "NTA. That is so far beyond not ok. She is disgusting for thinking that would ever be okay. Never ever let this woman alone with your child or your father if he thinks for even a moment this is okay.", "What the fffff.\n\nThis is beyond weird. There are so many other options if she wanted to sooth her herself, does your daughter have a dummy? I dont understand why offering her own  nipple would ever, ever be a consideration.\n\nNTA at all.", "Nta when my daughter was fussy and MY MUM didn\u2019t have a dummy or bottle handy she used her finger! Wtf wrong with crazy lady!", "NTA. This post made me physically jolt when I read what she did. Holy hell. That\u2019s fucking insane.  Insane.", "NTA. Eeeewwwwwww what kind of weirdo does that? I would be worried too. Babies get fussy. How are you supposed to predict what this lady is going to do next?  It\u2019s easier just to say no thanks I\u2019ll watch my own baby.", "NTA. She's really lucky you didn't report her to the police. I would never ever let my child be around her unsupervised, and frankly I wouldn't want to be around her either because she sounds seriously unhinged.", "NTA and she crossed a major line. Sounds like she has no concept of boundaries.", "Hell no! Holy shit, never in my wildest imagination could I ever conceive of this being an issue anyone ever needed to address, let alone defend themselves to their family about! No it\u2019s not normal, it\u2019s not normal at any point in their reproductive lives forget about the post-menopause aspect of it. I can see it in the instance it was a dire emergency with a child needing milk, and a woman who happened to be nursing stepping in but short of that consent is a must, and lactating a requirement to even offer. You\u2019re more forgiving than me because I would make sure she never saw my child again, and probably called the police. NTA", "NTA, but wow I would have serious issues with my husband too if I were OP. Imagine your husband keeping that information from you. A stranger put her nipples in your infants mouth and he didn\u2019t think to tell OP? I would have have lost my shit at that tbh.", "NTA. What a weirdo. I'm sure it's not a sexual thing but it is weird as hell.", "Nta she pretty much s**ually assaulted your kid. I'd cut all contact.", "Oof. That's wrong on so many levels. Not her child and she's not even producing milk, she has nooo business pretending to breastfeed your baby. I wouldn't let that women touch my child ever again even with supervision for that stunt. That is beyond wrong to do to someone else's child.\n\nThat women is lucky you didn't file a police report against her for SA to your baby. No women should breastfeed another women's child unless it is an emergency and permission is granted.", "NTA - why on earth did she think that was an ok thing to do? You have every right to not want your child around them unsupervised after that. Also, why on earth would your fiance not have told you about that immediately after finding it out?", "A normal person watching a baby that\u2019s being fussy will cradle and rock them gently, give them a bottle, maybe read to them or sing them a lullaby, not just whip out a nip for the kid. Genuinely, what the hell is wrong with her? NTA", "NTA. That\u2019s beyond the pale of unacceptable behavior. \n\nEven if she were a lactating mom herself and thought your baby was hungry, she should have spoken with you first before putting her nipple into your child\u2019s mouth. I get that babies nurse for comfort, not always just milk, but that\u2019s\u2026 not something somebody who\u2019s not their mom should be offering. This is very bizarre and shows at BEST, a lack of reason and judgement on her part. She shouldn\u2019t ever be alone with small children.", "NTA. She's not equipped for and did not have permission to pretend-nurse your baby. Has she never heard of a pacifier or bottle? You don't just stick your milkless tit into someone else's baby's mouth! Geez!", "NTA.  That sounds odd.  Why not a pacifier?", "NTA. Highly inappropriate and disturbing.", "NTA\n\nI will say that you didn\u2019t need to inform them of your decision. You could just do it, telling them just opens the door for needless discussion.", "Major violation and I can\u2019t imagine any sane person doing that (although this is not the first time I\u2019m reading a story like this, unfortunately). If anything, everyone around you is under reacting. That would be a no from me, dawg.\n\nNTA, obviously.", "Good lawd Almighty, this is NASTY \u2757\u2757\u2757\u2757", "NTA. She sexually assaulted your child.", "I would call police", "NTA and that\u2019s extremely disturbing.", "INFO  This feels like - possibly - there could be a cultural issue/cultural barrier at play here.  Is there?  Did this woman breastfeed her own children? \n\nI've certainly heard of cultures where older women \"re-lactate\" when they become grandmothers, which, if that's really the case, would make sense as a type of evolutionary insurance policy ensuring the survival of the infant.  Not saying that this would make everything fine, but it would place it in context if that's the case.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
