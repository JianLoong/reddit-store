I was just sleeping a little bit longer\u2026\n\n-Messages me in the morning and at night\n\n-said she won\u2019t feel safe about me until I marry \n\n-Asks me to say goodnight to her everyday \n\n-If I don\u2019t call at the usual time, she calls me or messages me freaking out that something is wrong. \n\n-Lately she\u2019s been checking my location on Find My Friend if I don\u2019t answer her messages.\n\nThe other day I slept through my alarm, she and my dad freaked out calling me. When I didn\u2019t pick up she found my boyfriend on Instagram and tried to follow him. \n\n-Same thing happened earlier. I left work early, she was checking my location and saw I wasn\u2019t at work. Wanted me to call her ASAP. \n\n\nI\u2019m going insane.\nI\u2019m THIRTY YEARS OLD. \nI feel trapped. I can\u2019t do anything without letting my mum know so she doesn\u2019t pass out from her stupid anxiety. \nIve wanted to take spontaneous trips or go somewhere by myself but I can\u2019t\u2026 cos she will be crying, hyperventilating and freaking out. \nI feel like I can\u2019t even make my own decisions sometimes without asking my mum if it\u2019s ok?! I ask her if I should take time off work or not?! It\u2019s ridiculous \n\n\nI turned off Find my friend, called her crazy and told her to leave me alone.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEDIT:\nTo add. She\u2019s add no past trauma that would have caused this - at least not that I know of.\nI don\u2019t do drugs, I barely drink, I don\u2019t sleep around.\nI moved to a country by myself, have two degrees and working on the third one.", "created_utc": 1675409690, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10seg0w/aita_for_turning_off_find_my_friend_and_calling/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think your efforts are a reasonable start, and you're going to have to go much further than this.\n\nPeople who can't mind their own business need to be put on very strict information diets, and every time they overstep then you ratchet up the controls. You may have to remember as a follower from social media, or simply stop using as much social media, or create a second account. You certainly need to stop talking to her on a daily basis. You'll also need to explain to your close friends that your mom is not allowed to get information about you through them.", "NTA. I\u2019m going to tell you the same thing my MOM\u2019S therapist told me - the second you refuse to let her control your feelings (guilt, shame, etc. - all the fun ones) or your thoughts or your actions, that\u2019s when you\u2019ll finally be able to breathe. I think turning off Find My Friend is extremely healthy. Your mom needs to realize that you are a human being completely separate from her, and you are capable of functioning independently in the world. She will *never* realize this on her own. So you\u2019re going to have to make the changes yourself. And it sucks. I\u2019m sorry. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA - you are 30 years old and she's haranguing you from across the world if you are not doing the things she thinks you should be. I can see why you moved so far away.\n\nShe's still trying to control you even though you are well into adulthood and halfway across the world. In this situation she only has the power that you let her have. Leave her cut off. Take some time to breathe and live for yourself.\n\nOh, one more thing. Can you talk to local police in case she tries to call a wellness check on you? I doubt she'll rock up on your doorstep, but do you have cameras just in case she does?\n\n((hugs)) and good luck!", "NTA\n\nFor some reason your mum hasn't accepted that you are a fully functioning human independent of her. And it is now ruining your quality of life. So it's okay to take her off find my friends.\n\nI think you need to figure out what your boundaries are in terms of keeping communication with her\n\n* How often are you happy to call her? Once a week? Once a month?\n* How often are you happy to text her?\n* What things are you willing to discuss with her and what parts of your life are private to you?\n* Do you want to be connected to her on social media?\n\nDecide for yourself what you want your relationship with her (and your dad) to look like then call them and communicate that to them. Tell them you love them but need to live your life. Let her cry and wail and react as she will. Then stick to your guns. Tell all the people she could send to follow up with you what your boundaries are. Ignore her if she tries to push your boundaries (and she will) but since it sounds like you want to continue to be in touch with her, honour your commitment for the weekly text/phone call/ whatever you decide. That will give her time to get used to the new relationship boundaries and know that you will stick to your word. \n\nI don't know if any of this sounds like it will work for you but I wish you all the best. I'm sorry that you are going through this.", "Treat her like you would a toddler.  The sooner you stop giving in to her tantrums the sooner she\u2019ll give up throwing them.  You should\u2019ve started 12 years ago but here we are.  Remember you have all the power and if you choose not to use it the fault is yours.  NTA unless you keep rewarding tantrums.", "NTA! You\u2019re 30! There\u2019s no reason she needs your location information unless it\u2019s a net positive for you. Ultimately your mother needs to accept you\u2019re an adult and can manage your own life (it sounds like quite well!). Her emotional reaction to these boundaries are her responsibility to manage", "NTA.  Next time your mum has freak out, ask her what she did at 30,  ask her how much her mum called her and  why she cant see you are an adult and tell her to get therapy.", "Sorry if it\u2019s hard to read.\nI\u2019m shaking, trying not to cry while at the doctors office (reason why I left work early)", "NTA.  Your mother needs to let go. Perhaps a few months of no contact would help you focus on your life and not on her. You are grown up and deserve to cut the apron strings.", "NTA -and your parents need to learn boundaries.", "NTA at all! Your mother is unhinged and delusional!", "NTA. You need to tell her to leave you the fuck alone.", "NTA. This is way beyond being concerned: it's intrusive and controlling. You are right to try to stop this.", "NTA. This is unhealthy behavior for the both of you. \n\nYou can't control what she does. You can only control what you do. Set boundaries in place with both mom and dad. Enforce those boundaries.\n\n Go low or NC you have the ability to choose what is healthy for you. You have the right to be happy and live a full life on YOUR TERMS. \n\nYour friend(s) and BF will also needs to set boundaries with her when she calls. They can also block her all together. Her going through them to get to you is ridiculous.", "When I started this, I assumed you were <18 based on her behavior. There's absolutely no reason she should still be this up in your business at 30 years old. NTA and I would also block + remove her as a follower on Instagram as well.", "NTA and remove yourself from your mothers family account. You'll loose access to all of the purchased content and services but she won't have a way to check for your devices or location.\n\nCut the cord since she won't.", "Nta. You hit a breaking point.  She needs therapy.  Tell her contact can resume (with boundaries set by you) once she proves she's seemed professional help.  Force her to take the initiative.  I've seen a lot of parents that use anxiety as an excuse for being a helicopter when in reality they are obsessive controlling people.", "NTA. I'm not a professional, but it sounds like she has BPD, though, with abandonment issues. She does need help because this is not normal and it's ruining her relationship with you.", "NTA !!! Oh god I stopped reading when I reached the part where you say you're 30 YEARS OLD. \n\nYour mom need to chill the hell out. \n\nNTA for turning off find my friend, maybe a little bit A H calling her crazy but well, she is acting a bit crazy... this is going to take time, but you have to make her accept that you're a grown up and she has to start dealing with her fears ASAP. Having to control you this much is not normal, there are some deep feelings to work out there, maybe even with a therapist? \n\nBut she'll have to understand that if she doesn't stop acting like this, she'll lose her daughter. \n\nPS: why will she only feel safe when you marry? argh", "NTA\n\nYou are 30 years old and she is still trying to control your life from a distance.\n\nRegular contact is healthy, forced daily contact is no. Your mum freaking out when you do ANYTHING other than daily routine and needing to ask permission(?) for even taking a day of from work is ridiculous.\n\nIf she keeps doing this, you are going to resent her more and more. And maybe you should tell her this (although not this direct, maybe soften the words a bit).", "NTA of course. But prepare yourself for a fallout. I am very happy for you, if it doesn't come. But it sounds like your parents are the kind of people who will show up at your doorstep next, even so you live on the other side of the planet.", "NTA, your mom sounds like she has serious anxiety issues that would benefit from professional help. My mom was very similar, and I had to set firm boundaries with her. You have every right to live your own life without having to answer to your mom for everything.", "NTA\n\nher anxiety is her problem and about time to get therapy.", "NTA obviously \nSend her a message reminding her you are 30 years old and if she doesn't back off then you'll limit contact with her. She needs to get a grip and not make HER problem yours.", "NTA. Honey. She is manipulating you. Turn off the find my friend and do not tell her where you are all the time. Create boundaries. Her anxiety and panic attacks are not yours to manage.", "NTA\n\nIf it's getting to the point where you can't sleep in, go on vacation, and miss work due to stress....its time to go low to no contact. \n\nWith how extreme your mums behavior is, honestly it might be worth going no contact for six months. Let her know it too. No contacting friends boyfriend workplaces ect. Just blackout. \nDo it to see how you feel. How does that change your behavior? What emotions does it bring up?", "NAH, if my son moved across the world I\u2019d be a wreck too but it\u2019s pushed too far, she can\u2019t control you like this it\u2019s unhealthy", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She feels she needs control, for whatever reason, but no matter how small and controllable you make yourself, she'll always need more. However, what she really needs is therapy, and that is not your responsibility. In fact, letting her track you every which way is enabling her, and destroying your life at the same time. Put your foot down, let your dad pick up the chips wherever they may fall, and know that if she has a full blown breakdown because you want to live a normal life, it may just end up being the best thing to happen to her since you were born.", "NTA, just tell her as long the police or a hospital is not contacting her to inform her about your passing she should take \"i'm alive\" as the default. If she can't do this then you will have to go LC or tempoary NC with her.", "Also tell friend to block her.

Go live your life with no regrets.", "You shouldn't have to set yourself on fire to keep other people warm, not even your dad who is clearly also a guilty party in this.\n\nThey clearly don't care about your feelings on the matter, as they're easing their worries *at your expense*.\nThen they gaslight you into thinking that it's somehow your fault.\nThe fact that your mother does everything for you is a point of control, which is not something you ought to be too to be grateful for. She wants you to be dependent on her, which is why they react this way every time you try to assert boundaries. \n\nYou're not being hurtful or disrespectful for wanting space and freedom to live your own life, you're an adult, damn it.", "Yep, that's how they keep control, they wear you out.  Block them and go NC for a couple of months, putting in place whatever safeguards you need to.
