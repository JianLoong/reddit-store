I think your efforts are a reasonable start, and you're going to have to go much further than this.\n\nPeople who can't mind their own business need to be put on very strict information diets, and every time they overstep then you ratchet up the controls. You may have to remember as a follower from social media, or simply stop using as much social media, or create a second account. You certainly need to stop talking to her on a daily basis. You'll also need to explain to your close friends that your mom is not allowed to get information about you through them.", "NTA.

I think turning off Find My Friend is extremely healthy. Your mom needs to realize that you are a human being completely separate from her, and you are capable of functioning independently in the world. She will *never* realize this on her own.

In this situation she only has the power that you let her have. Leave her cut off. Take some time to breathe and live for yourself.\n\nOh, one more thing.

Tell them you love them but need to live your life. Let her cry and wail and react as she will. Then stick to your guns. Tell all the people she could send to follow up with you what your boundaries are. Ignore her if she tries to push your boundaries (and she will) but since it sounds like you want to continue to be in touch with her, honour your commitment for the weekly text/phone call/ whatever you decide.

Oh god I stopped reading when I reached the part where you say you're 30 YEARS OLD. \n\nYour mom need to chill the hell out. \n\nNTA for turning off find my friend, maybe a little bit A H calling her crazy but well, she is acting a bit crazy... this is going to take time, but you have to make her accept that you're a grown up and she has to start dealing with her fears ASAP. Having to control you this much is not normal, there are some deep feelings to work out there, maybe even with a therapist? \n\nBut she'll have to understand that if she doesn't stop acting like this, she'll lose her daughter. \n\nPS: why will she only feel safe when you marry? argh", "NTA\n\nYou are 30 years old and she is still trying to control your life from a distance.\n\nRegular contact is healthy, forced daily contact is no.

She feels she needs control, for whatever reason, but no matter how small and controllable you make yourself, she'll always need more. However, what she really needs is therapy, and that is not your responsibility. In fact, letting her track you every which way is enabling her, and destroying your life at the same time.

Unfriend her on FB and any other social media and as your friends to do the same, tell her it's feeding her neurosis, and you can reconnect once she has learned to live with the new rules.

It's not up to you to coddle her and make her somehow feel 'safe' about you.  This is her issue to work on, not yours.  Do you have another parent who is involved?  Anyone who can help her see that this is an issue that she needs to address?  Honestly, your mom needs some sort of therapy, but it isn't on you to make sure she gets it here.  All you can really do here is set some boundaries (turning off 'Find My Friend is a start) and sticking to them.  And encourage mom to get some help.\n\nEdited to add:  It would help you to sit down with a therapist too.  Family dynamics have a way of influencing us long after we are adults.  I don't have this particular mother issues, but I do have mother issues, and am still untangling them at an age much older than you.  Talking to a professional may help you to be able to set some boundaries because  your mom made sure you didn't learn these skills in your youth and sometimes when we have dysfunctional early dynamics we need someone later to model these things for us.", "NTA. go to the cops. this is clearly harassment", "NTA.

Boundaries aren\u2019t about your parents, they\u2019re about you. Your parents don\u2019t have to accept them. You don\u2019t need to explain, shout, scream or anything. You DECIDE what boundaries are appropriate and then you enforce them for yourself (and ignore their reactions) and never ever budge. My guess is that you feel guilt when trying to enforce boundaries so you try to explain to your parents why they should respect them. But they never ever will\u2026 so YOU have to grow, accept the guilt as part of the process and enforce boundaries without explanation. \n\nMay I suggest you look up JADE (Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain) and enmeshed family dynamics.

She would have felt the same way you do now.\n\nAs others have said, you need to go low contact for a while. Decide how often you are willing to call/be called. Set out your parameters on an email, they can't argue or guilt trip an email. Set consequences for overstepping. Emphasize that you still love them both, but this stalking behavior has to stop if they want to have a relationship with you. Then you need to learn to grey rock them.

She's going to have an extinction burst, both of your parents are going to escalate their behavior to try to get you back in line because controlling your behavior soothes her anxiety, but it's not healthy for you to do that for her. You have to stay strong. She might not have trauma related to an event like this specifically, but she doesn't need to to develop an anxiety disorder like this. It's also not your job to manage your father's feelings by reducing her reactions so he doesn't get hit by her outbursts. He's an adult. \n\nYou should do some research into this, it will help you. Start with the \"don't rock the boat\" message on Reddit, then Codependent No More, Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents, Walking on Eggshells, and see if you can get yourself into therapy as well. You may want to look into CPTSD for yourself, and EMDR if it looks like that fits. I'm sure other people have some good book recs, I've heard The Body Keeps the Score is amazing but I'm still in line at the library for that one so I can't personally recommend it.", "Hooo boy.  You need to put your mother (and father it sounds like) on a very, very limited contact/information plan.  My suggestion is to do everything at once, rip off the band-aid.  Block her on social media, put her ringtone to silent, or perhaps block of number except for certain times during the day.  Send her an email explaining that you cannot let her anxiety control your life anymore.  She needs some serious therapy to address her shit.  Tell her you will be in charge of communication, and attempts to contact/control you via side channels will not be tolerated.  I suggest you see a therapist as well to unpack this nonsense.\n\nAnd the comment that she'll won't feel safe about you until you marry?

At a certain time.  No more than an hour\n2. Talk to your friends, bf, and anyone else she may contact, and tell them that you are putting her on a contact and information diet.

And what on earth makes her think you'll only be safe once you marry? Believe me my first marriage was anything but. \n\nYou need to set boundaries and do it now. Decide what contact if any you want and carefully and clearly explain to your mum what those boundaries are, in a letter or email if necessary. After that, let your mum scream and throw a fit and cry and generally behave like an indulged toddler. It won't actually harm her. If she sends police to your door to do a welfare check, explain that your mother is over protective and that you, as an adult, have set boundaries which she doesn't like, they'll have seen this before I'm sure.

Parents like that often feel their child is part of themselves rather than an independent person.\n\nYou need to learn how to establish healthy boundaries.  You cannot control how your mom behaves, but you can control how you react to it.  Yelling at her won't do anything.  Depriving her of what she cares about - contact with you - will motivate a behavior change.\n\nAs others said, come up with some simple rules and consequences.  Text or email them to your mother, and silence your phone for the next day so you don't have to deal with her calling to complain.  Then stick to those rules.\n\n- I will contact you once every _____ If you call or tryto get me to call you more frequently, you'll be in time out for _____ days and I will block all forms of communication during the timeout \n\n- You may not contact my friends, neighbors, etc, unless you haven't heard from me in x days and are not currently on a timeout.   If you do so you will not hear from me for x weeks.\n\n- If you complain about these boundaries is will immediately hang up and block you for x days.\n\n- We will only text/message through ____ platform.  I'm blocking you on all other channels for simplicity and because you've abused your ability to monitor my presence online.\n\nThat last one is important because it will make it easier for you to enforce timeouts.  It's a lot to have to block someone in your phone app, Whatsapp, FB messenger, etc every time.  So leave her blocked on all apps except one.  When she behaves, you communicate with her via that one.  When she's manipulative and controlling, you block her on that channel as well and have a well deserved rest.\n\nYou are telling her the rules, but the consequences are all things that *you* control.\n\nIf you know anything about training a dog, think about it that way (we usually say toddler, but from your reply it's clear that you haven't yet had a chance to see how healthy parents manage toddlers).  You don't scream and yell at a dog - you calmly give consequences and rewards.  And they change their behavior.\n\nThe same approach usually works with parents like this, as long as you are consistent.  Don't give in - that will teach her if she harasses you enough she'll get what she wants.   And she will likely escalate either the harassment or love bombing at first.

Be clear that they are not allowed to call your friends; if they do, they get cut off for a period of time.  Make that the \"punishment\" for annoying your friends.

It's taken me this long to properly understand that this is about control, not concern, and this is about her and absolutely nothing to do with me. \n\nI finally set some boundaries. I've tried all the things you mention and nothing worked. Boundaries? They now work because I've made them about me. I don't care if she feels hurt. If she violates them, I don't respond. I show no upset, no anger, nothing. I'll just tell her, Hey,  I asked you if you call and I don't pick up, to assume that I'm occupied and to not call 22 times in a row. Since you can't abide that boundary, I'm taking a break right now and I will call back when I feel comfortable about you again. She's now learned that I'll do exactly that. And she can't guilt me into calling her or picking up when she calls or respond when she sends her flying monkeys after me. It took years and years but it's working.
