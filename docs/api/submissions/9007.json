I think your efforts are a reasonable start, and you're going to have to go much further than this.\n\nPeople who can't mind their own business need to be put on very strict information diets, and every time they overstep then you ratchet up the controls. You may have to remember as a follower from social media, or simply stop using as much social media, or create a second account. You certainly need to stop talking to her on a daily basis. You'll also need to explain to your close friends that your mom is not allowed to get information about you through them.", "NTA. I\u2019m going to tell you the same thing my MOM\u2019S therapist told me - the second you refuse to let her control your feelings (guilt, shame, etc. - all the fun ones) or your thoughts or your actions, that\u2019s when you\u2019ll finally be able to breathe. I think turning off Find My Friend is extremely healthy. Your mom needs to realize that you are a human being completely separate from her, and you are capable of functioning independently in the world. She will *never* realize this on her own. So you\u2019re going to have to make the changes yourself. And it sucks. I\u2019m sorry. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA - you are 30 years old and she's haranguing you from across the world if you are not doing the things she thinks you should be. I can see why you moved so far away.\n\nShe's still trying to control you even though you are well into adulthood and halfway across the world. In this situation she only has the power that you let her have. Leave her cut off. Take some time to breathe and live for yourself.\n\nOh, one more thing. Can you talk to local police in case she tries to call a wellness check on you? I doubt she'll rock up on your doorstep, but do you have cameras just in case she does?\n\n((hugs)) and good luck!", "NTA\n\nFor some reason your mum hasn't accepted that you are a fully functioning human independent of her. And it is now ruining your quality of life. So it's okay to take her off find my friends.\n\nI think you need to figure out what your boundaries are in terms of keeping communication with her\n\n* How often are you happy to call her? Once a week? Once a month?\n* How often are you happy to text her?\n* What things are you willing to discuss with her and what parts of your life are private to you?\n* Do you want to be connected to her on social media?\n\nDecide for yourself what you want your relationship with her (and your dad) to look like then call them and communicate that to them. Tell them you love them but need to live your life. Let her cry and wail and react as she will. Then stick to your guns. Tell all the people she could send to follow up with you what your boundaries are. Ignore her if she tries to push your boundaries (and she will) but since it sounds like you want to continue to be in touch with her, honour your commitment for the weekly text/phone call/ whatever you decide. That will give her time to get used to the new relationship boundaries and know that you will stick to your word. \n\nI don't know if any of this sounds like it will work for you but I wish you all the best. I'm sorry that you are going through this.", "Treat her like you would a toddler.  The sooner you stop giving in to her tantrums the sooner she\u2019ll give up throwing them.  You should\u2019ve started 12 years ago but here we are.  Remember you have all the power and if you choose not to use it the fault is yours.  NTA unless you keep rewarding tantrums.", "NTA! You\u2019re 30! There\u2019s no reason she needs your location information unless it\u2019s a net positive for you. Ultimately your mother needs to accept you\u2019re an adult and can manage your own life (it sounds like quite well!). Her emotional reaction to these boundaries are her responsibility to manage", "NTA.  Next time your mum has freak out, ask her what she did at 30,  ask her how much her mum called her and  why she cant see you are an adult and tell her to get therapy.", "Sorry if it\u2019s hard to read.\nI\u2019m shaking, trying not to cry while at the doctors office (reason why I left work early)", "NTA.  Your mother needs to let go. Perhaps a few months of no contact would help you focus on your life and not on her. You are grown up and deserve to cut the apron strings.", "NTA -and your parents need to learn boundaries.", "NTA at all! Your mother is unhinged and delusional!", "NTA. You need to tell her to leave you the fuck alone.", "NTA. This is way beyond being concerned: it's intrusive and controlling. You are right to try to stop this.", "NTA. This is unhealthy behavior for the both of you. \n\nYou can't control what she does. You can only control what you do. Set boundaries in place with both mom and dad. Enforce those boundaries.\n\n Go low or NC you have the ability to choose what is healthy for you. You have the right to be happy and live a full life on YOUR TERMS. \n\nYour friend(s) and BF will also needs to set boundaries with her when she calls. They can also block her all together. Her going through them to get to you is ridiculous.", "When I started this, I assumed you were <18 based on her behavior. There's absolutely no reason she should still be this up in your business at 30 years old. NTA and I would also block + remove her as a follower on Instagram as well.", "NTA and remove yourself from your mothers family account. You'll loose access to all of the purchased content and services but she won't have a way to check for your devices or location.\n\nCut the cord since she won't.", "Nta. You hit a breaking point.  She needs therapy.  Tell her contact can resume (with boundaries set by you) once she proves she's seemed professional help.  Force her to take the initiative.  I've seen a lot of parents that use anxiety as an excuse for being a helicopter when in reality they are obsessive controlling people.", "NTA. I'm not a professional, but it sounds like she has BPD, though, with abandonment issues. She does need help because this is not normal and it's ruining her relationship with you.", "NTA !!! Oh god I stopped reading when I reached the part where you say you're 30 YEARS OLD. \n\nYour mom need to chill the hell out. \n\nNTA for turning off find my friend, maybe a little bit A H calling her crazy but well, she is acting a bit crazy... this is going to take time, but you have to make her accept that you're a grown up and she has to start dealing with her fears ASAP. Having to control you this much is not normal, there are some deep feelings to work out there, maybe even with a therapist? \n\nBut she'll have to understand that if she doesn't stop acting like this, she'll lose her daughter. \n\nPS: why will she only feel safe when you marry? argh", "NTA\n\nYou are 30 years old and she is still trying to control your life from a distance.\n\nRegular contact is healthy, forced daily contact is no. Your mum freaking out when you do ANYTHING other than daily routine and needing to ask permission(?) for even taking a day of from work is ridiculous.\n\nIf she keeps doing this, you are going to resent her more and more. And maybe you should tell her this (although not this direct, maybe soften the words a bit).", "NTA of course. But prepare yourself for a fallout. I am very happy for you, if it doesn't come. But it sounds like your parents are the kind of people who will show up at your doorstep next, even so you live on the other side of the planet.", "NTA, your mom sounds like she has serious anxiety issues that would benefit from professional help. My mom was very similar, and I had to set firm boundaries with her. You have every right to live your own life without having to answer to your mom for everything.", "NTA\n\nher anxiety is her problem and about time to get therapy.", "NTA obviously \nSend her a message reminding her you are 30 years old and if she doesn't back off then you'll limit contact with her. She needs to get a grip and not make HER problem yours.", "NTA. Honey. She is manipulating you. Turn off the find my friend and do not tell her where you are all the time. Create boundaries. Her anxiety and panic attacks are not yours to manage.", "NTA\n\nIf it's getting to the point where you can't sleep in, go on vacation, and miss work due to stress....its time to go low to no contact. \n\nWith how extreme your mums behavior is, honestly it might be worth going no contact for six months. Let her know it too. No contacting friends boyfriend workplaces ect. Just blackout. \nDo it to see how you feel. How does that change your behavior? What emotions does it bring up?", "NAH, if my son moved across the world I\u2019d be a wreck too but it\u2019s pushed too far, she can\u2019t control you like this it\u2019s unhealthy", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She feels she needs control, for whatever reason, but no matter how small and controllable you make yourself, she'll always need more. However, what she really needs is therapy, and that is not your responsibility. In fact, letting her track you every which way is enabling her, and destroying your life at the same time. Put your foot down, let your dad pick up the chips wherever they may fall, and know that if she has a full blown breakdown because you want to live a normal life, it may just end up being the best thing to happen to her since you were born.", "NTA, just tell her as long the police or a hospital is not contacting her to inform her about your passing she should take \"i'm alive\" as the default. If she can't do this then you will have to go LC or tempoary NC with her.", "Also tell friend to block her.

Set strict boundaries. You don't have to ask or even tell her about any plans you make. Her emotional problems are hers to overcome, but she won't if you continue to enable her behavior. Go live your life with no regrets.", "You shouldn't have to set yourself on fire to keep other people warm, not even your dad who is clearly also a guilty party in this.\n\nThey clearly don't care about your feelings on the matter, as they're easing their worries *at your expense*.\nThen they gaslight you into thinking that it's somehow your fault.\nThe fact that your mother does everything for you is a point of control, which is not something you ought to be too to be grateful for. She wants you to be dependent on her, which is why they react this way every time you try to assert boundaries. \n\nYou're not being hurtful or disrespectful for wanting space and freedom to live your own life, you're an adult, damn it.", "Yep, that's how they keep control, they wear you out.  Block them and go NC for a couple of months, putting in place whatever safeguards you need to. After 2-3 months of NC, ask them if they're willing to respect your boundaries and if so, you'll allow XYZ contact, and the minute you find them pushing boundaries it'll be back to NC.", "Screaming , crying and swearing is not where your power is.

You need to tell her to stop interfering in your life or you will go no contact.", "Wow, sit her down, tell her this is unacceptable. Then tell her your turning off your app and set ground rules and stick with them. If she Flys off the handle ignore it.

She called my colleges security one time and they interrupted a class to come find me because she'd read about a subway accident in the city my school is in and I wasn't answering my phone because I was, you know, IN CLASS. So embarrassing.", "NTA. Unfortunately you need to block all of her information flow. Tell her you are doing it and warn any friends she might try to contact that she may reach out because you put her on an information diet. Don\u2019t try to appease her because she seems like the \u201cgive an inch, take a mile type. Tell her you will Call at X time and no more", "NTA, you need to set boundaries, and if they have to be enforced by eg asking your friends to block her, then you do that.\n\nDon't yell or scream, calmly tell her what the new rules are, like you'll call her once a week, or whatever you're comfortable with, and apart from that she needs to respect that you're a grown woman who can look after herself. If she starts trying to guilt you, tell her you're sorry she feels like that, but this is how it has to be, if necessary suggest therapy to help her process her feelings around it.\n\nMake it as hard for her as possible to break the rules, could be getting a new phone number and leaving the other one off-line except for when you call her. Unfriend her on FB and any other social media and as your friends to do the same, tell her it's feeding her neurosis, and you can reconnect once she has learned to live with the new rules. Tell her that your boyfriend (or another friend) will contact her if something happens and you are not able. Put in place a consequence if she manages to get around your rules, like that you'll cancel the weekly call.\n\nGet a coach or a therapist to support you through this and make sure you feel good about this and not guilty. You are not your mom's support animal!", "NTA.  Your mom clearly has some sort of significant anxiety problem that she needs to work on.  It's not up to you to coddle her and make her somehow feel 'safe' about you.  This is her issue to work on, not yours.  Do you have another parent who is involved?  Anyone who can help her see that this is an issue that she needs to address?  Honestly, your mom needs some sort of therapy, but it isn't on you to make sure she gets it here.  All you can really do here is set some boundaries (turning off 'Find My Friend is a start) and sticking to them.  And encourage mom to get some help.\n\nEdited to add:  It would help you to sit down with a therapist too.  Family dynamics have a way of influencing us long after we are adults.  I don't have this particular mother issues, but I do have mother issues, and am still untangling them at an age much older than you.  Talking to a professional may help you to be able to set some boundaries because  your mom made sure you didn't learn these skills in your youth and sometimes when we have dysfunctional early dynamics we need someone later to model these things for us.", "NTA. go to the cops. this is clearly harassment", "NTA. Your Mom has significant and clearly untreated anxiety. It appears you and your family have been inadvertently enabling this.\n\nShe needs therapy to deal with her condition, and you should seek help, too, for your conditioning.", "Every time you allow your mother to invade your privacy, you\u2019re deepening **your** enmeshment trauma. If you ever want to live an emotionally healthy life and not affect future relationships, **you** will have to be the one to cut those trauma chains. At 30, you\u2019re the only one allowing your mother to do what she is doing to you. Take responsibility.\n\nNTA.", "From your other comments, I guess you don\u2019t really have an understanding of what boundaries are (not surprising as your parents never taught you). Boundaries aren\u2019t about your parents, they\u2019re about you. Your parents don\u2019t have to accept them. You don\u2019t need to explain, shout, scream or anything. You DECIDE what boundaries are appropriate and then you enforce them for yourself (and ignore their reactions) and never ever budge. My guess is that you feel guilt when trying to enforce boundaries so you try to explain to your parents why they should respect them. But they never ever will\u2026 so YOU have to grow, accept the guilt as part of the process and enforce boundaries without explanation. \n\nMay I suggest you look up JADE (Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain) and enmeshed family dynamics. Best would be to get a therapist. \nGood luck and courage!", "I would tell all my neighbors and friends to block her but something tells me OP gave their neighbors number to their mom.", "Your dad's a grown up, it's not your job to relieve him from the fighting.", "How old was your mom when she had you? I bet her mom did not do the equivalent when she was 30. Of course, we didn't have cell phones and apps that would allow this, but I doubt her mom didn't insist she call her every night/give her itinerary/ make her check in to say safe home. She would have felt the same way you do now.\n\nAs others have said, you need to go low contact for a while. Decide how often you are willing to call/be called. Set out your parameters on an email, they can't argue or guilt trip an email. Set consequences for overstepping. Emphasize that you still love them both, but this stalking behavior has to stop if they want to have a relationship with you. Then you need to learn to grey rock them. Setting boundaries your parents don't like will take time and patience, but it will be worth it in the end.", "Read the comment again, do people respond to toddlers having a temper tantrum by \u201cscreaming, crying, and swearing\u201d? You have to not give them what they want and then ignore them."]}
