Some days ago, my team went to play a match against my home city team and wanted to see my friends after the game.\n\nI have been friends with these people since high school and I would say they are the only true friends I have. It's incredibly difficult meeting people when you are kind of famous and supposedly rich, as most of the people want to use you in some way.\n\nWe all seemed very excited to see each other. My friends booked a restaurant with a private area. For future reference, this a nice place but not something super fancy, a regular dinner there could go for around 100\u20ac ($105).\n\nFast forward to the dinner, we were having a great time, everybody was there, the moment was perfect, and we started ordering our food after they had a cocktail (I don't drink during the season \ud83e\udd72).\n\nEverybody started ordering some of the most expensive dishes. This seemed odd to me but I didn't think much of it as I thought they simply wanted to enjoy the moment... until I saw them ordering some of the most luxurious wine bottles on the menu. One of the bottles alone cost 400\u20ac ($422). That's when I realized they expected me to cover for everything.\n\nI just froze, I didn't know how to react. I wanted my friends to be happy but I was also feeling used, this was giving me flashbacks of the multiple times other people had tried to take advantage of me.\n\nI think that the confusion came cause this restaurant is the same one we went to when I signed for my current club. That time I invited everyone as a celebration and they probably thought that this time was going to be the same.\n\nWhen everybody had ordered, I was thinking whether I should say something or not and my mood started declining after this. \n\nMy friends noticed this and asked if I was OK. I told them that they had made me feel extremely uncomfortable because I never said I was going to cover for everything.\n\nOne of my friends said \"man, you should have told us in advance, we can't pay 1K\u20ac each for a dinner\". I replied with \"you guys should have told me in advance, I thought we just wanted to spend some time together no matter the cost of the dinner\". \n\nThey started saying, that they will pay for it and I don't have to worry about it. This is the moment that broke my heart as I could see that they didn't want to take advantage of me but at the same they had put me in a difficult situation. The vibe was off after this although we stayed calmed and civil.\n\nThe final check was around 500\u20ac ($528) per person. 500\u20ac is a lot of money for my friends, most of them make around 1.5K per month. They can pay for it, but it's a big expenditure.\n\nEveryone remained sad but courteous all the time. They said goodbye in good manners and wished me the best for the rest of the season.\n\nNow I feel like shit, cause I could have managed the situation differently. They paid a lot when I could have easily covered for everything, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1696822853, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/173i963/aita_for_not_paying_for_a_group_dinner_even_i/", "score": 1174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And the rule normal people have when going out is to expect to pay for your own food at the very least. No one should ever order food or drinks and expect that someone else will be paying, regardless of how rich someone is. Unless you said you were paying, everyone decent would assume they're paying for themselves. If you aren't sure, you can ask. When you mentioned how you felt, they said they could pay. But considering it's 1/3 of their monthly paycheck, they knew it would be tough for them to pay so it was on them to check. \n\nYou can buy dinner. You can likely buy a lot of things and that's not the point. No one is owed a free meal. If you said you were treating, I still wouldn't have spent 500\u20ac for my portion knowing you were already paying. I'd make sure I get something nice but not extravagant. \n\nThese aren't real friends, they're users.

You didn't speak up until well after that point when everyone was stuck with the bill. \n\nYou also went in with the \"it isn't super fancy, 100\u20ac is a standard meal\". Maybe you're accustomed to expensive dinners but for a lot of folks 100\u20ac or $100 is far from inexpensive and definitely hits the level of special occasion or fancy dinner. \n\nI seldom ever pay more than $50-$70 for myself AND my wife, and I can certainly afford well above that. But that's not a fancy meal or special occasion out. \n\nI don't think there was any maliciousness there, just a lack of communication on all sides and a lot of assumptions that were incorrect on both sides. \n\nLesson here is don't assume, and next time be clear on whether you're paying for everyone or if everyone is responsible for their own bill.", "ESH.

So I do think based on your position in society the smart thing to do, in order to prevent any of the uncertainty would be to say \u201cmy treat, go ahead get steak, I won\u2019t be drinking, but let\u2019s ask if they have anything good they recommend\u2026\u201d.

Their fault at every turn.\n\nTrue friends never expect handouts. On the rare occasions that my friends have said they want to pay for everyone, my friend group orders the cheapest things.

NOT ok If not previously agreed on, regardless of the amount and regardless of your income/wealth!", "Definitely NTA. I think they've become too comfortable with your money. \n\nI get what you're going through at a smaller scale. When I was a teenager, my \"friends\" were my favourite people ever. We would hang out sometimes every day of the week, and if we were busy, we would still meet up at least once a week. As someone who has always struggled to make friends, this group meant EVERYTHING to me. They were my lifeline, they helped me through so much, they knew pretty much every detail of my life. We would get pizza or hot chips often and sit in the park together. Except when it came to ordering, I would always have at least one of them say \"oh I can't afford anything, I won't eat.\" I'd always respond with \"it's okay, my shout\". After a while, I was trying to save up my money and when they would say that, I wouldn't offer to shout and then it would always be \"Hey, can I please have some of this..?\" And I would share the food I bought for myself. Then, just before the pandemic hit in 2020, I got into an accident at work, cracked the back of my knee-cap, and was forced to quit. I was forced to go on a government supported benefit, and was struggling financially. It was so hard for me to start saying no to my \"friends\", especially since they just expected me to be generous. They stopped inviting me out that same year. I realised leading up to the argument that dissolved my 5-8 year old friendships with these people that they never liked me. They only kept me around because I was easy to take advantage of. \n\nI really hope you find friends that don't try to take advantage of you. You seem like a genuinely nice person and you deserve better than that.", "RIP dms", "NTA", "NTA.  \nIf I knew someone was going to pay, I still wouldn't order the expensive items, I'd order what I normally would and thank them. But to basically assume the rich person is paying is out of order.", "We have a couple of college friends that have made it insanely huge. We go where we can afford and everyone pays. Sometimes they want to go to unaffordable restaurants so they take us and call it a celebration. They go where we can stay if we vacation together and they do their high end vacations without us. Your friends need to appreciate you for you. If you want them to go somewhere expensive you may have to help out. NTA", "Definitely NTA. If they did think you were covering the whole thing it is still in bad taste to go blowing someone else\u2019s money that way! If someone offers to take you out then you order what you would order as if you were paying for it in my mind rather than thinking you can spend more because someone else is buying. I took a friend out for a nice meal as a thank you for a huge amount of help and support he has given me with a specific situation. I know he will order as he would normally so I told him I wanted to get us a bottle of champagne to start and choose the wine for over dinner. I spent way more on that then he would ever allow if he was choosing it but I wanted to show my gratitude. The fact that they thought they could order more expensive goods because you were picking up the tab isn\u2019t kind of them and it is understandable you are hurt and wonder if they were there to see you or get a free meal.\nAt the other side of things as you have become aware you do not get to have the same life that you used to have. It is sad but the success comes at a price. It is good that you all managed to keep it civil and hopefully they understand the difference between being invited out for something and meeting up with a friend for a catch up now.\nI don\u2019t think you should feel guilty but give it 4-6 weeks. In that amount of time it will also allow you to gauge how they have reacted to this too. Some of them may be embarrassed by their actions and feel bad for making the assumption, some of them may be a bit annoyed and snub you. The extra time will allow you to see the true friends. Then maybe you can get those who come through for you a little something extra for Christmas or something?

I have several relatives that will now expect me to pay for things that nobody else is expected to pay for. I paid for a resort for a dozen family members to go on vacation, one couple tried to insist on paying me back, most everyone else just graciously accepted... Then there was my brother's girlfriend! She charged as much as she could to the room because she thought I had to pay for it. Which I did, but I handed her the bill at the end and since she was the only one doing it it was super easy to realize it was all her! I heard her whining about it saying \"I wouldn't have ordered it all if I thought I had to pay!\" Girlfriend was ordering Starbucks and cheesecake for herself every morning! She literally said to my mother 2 different times, that she was getting drinks and putting them on my tab! Like what? These are the kind of people that you don't want to treat! Because the second you do they start to feel entitled to all your money! \n\nI'm sorry your friends acted like that. Making money really does change the way other people react to you.

Then you should arrange for something individualised - and here's where it gets tricky - you have to decide for each of them whether it's you know that each of them needs or if it's a treat. Either way it should be big enough to help offset the bill. Ideally, you should talk to their wives if they are married, to ask. It shouldn't cover the whole bill though - like 300 euros - and ideally it should be directed to their kids.\n\nThis will show your friends that they can't try to pin a bill on you, so it won't happen again, but also it will be clear to them that you are trying to be mindful. \n\nBe prepared that you may also get some backlash - there can be jealousy and backstabbing, and for those people nothing you can do will ever be right.\n\nI'm sorry you are in the unlucky position of celebrity - it means that it's going to be harder for you to get married, it's always going to be harder for you to trust new people, and you'll only really be able to mix with people with similar wealth.
