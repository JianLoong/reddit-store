Some days ago, my team went to play a match against my home city team and wanted to see my friends after the game.\n\nI have been friends with these people since high school and I would say they are the only true friends I have. It's incredibly difficult meeting people when you are kind of famous and supposedly rich, as most of the people want to use you in some way.\n\nWe all seemed very excited to see each other. My friends booked a restaurant with a private area. For future reference, this a nice place but not something super fancy, a regular dinner there could go for around 100\u20ac ($105).\n\nFast forward to the dinner, we were having a great time, everybody was there, the moment was perfect, and we started ordering our food after they had a cocktail (I don't drink during the season \ud83e\udd72).\n\nEverybody started ordering some of the most expensive dishes. This seemed odd to me but I didn't think much of it as I thought they simply wanted to enjoy the moment... until I saw them ordering some of the most luxurious wine bottles on the menu. One of the bottles alone cost 400\u20ac ($422). That's when I realized they expected me to cover for everything.\n\nI just froze, I didn't know how to react. I wanted my friends to be happy but I was also feeling used, this was giving me flashbacks of the multiple times other people had tried to take advantage of me.\n\nI think that the confusion came cause this restaurant is the same one we went to when I signed for my current club. That time I invited everyone as a celebration and they probably thought that this time was going to be the same.\n\nWhen everybody had ordered, I was thinking whether I should say something or not and my mood started declining after this. \n\nMy friends noticed this and asked if I was OK. I told them that they had made me feel extremely uncomfortable because I never said I was going to cover for everything.\n\nOne of my friends said \"man, you should have told us in advance, we can't pay 1K\u20ac each for a dinner\". I replied with \"you guys should have told me in advance, I thought we just wanted to spend some time together no matter the cost of the dinner\". \n\nThey started saying, that they will pay for it and I don't have to worry about it. This is the moment that broke my heart as I could see that they didn't want to take advantage of me but at the same they had put me in a difficult situation. The vibe was off after this although we stayed calmed and civil.\n\nThe final check was around 500\u20ac ($528) per person. 500\u20ac is a lot of money for my friends, most of them make around 1.5K per month. They can pay for it, but it's a big expenditure.\n\nEveryone remained sad but courteous all the time. They said goodbye in good manners and wished me the best for the rest of the season.\n\nNow I feel like shit, cause I could have managed the situation differently. They paid a lot when I could have easily covered for everything, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1696822853, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/173i963/aita_for_not_paying_for_a_group_dinner_even_i/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And the rule normal people have when going out is to expect to pay for your own food at the very least. No one should ever order food or drinks and expect that someone else will be paying, regardless of how rich someone is. Unless you said you were paying, everyone decent would assume they're paying for themselves. If you aren't sure, you can ask. When you mentioned how you felt, they said they could pay. But considering it's 1/3 of their monthly paycheck, they knew it would be tough for them to pay so it was on them to check. \n\nYou can buy dinner. You can likely buy a lot of things and that's not the point. No one is owed a free meal. If you said you were treating, I still wouldn't have spent 500\u20ac for my portion knowing you were already paying. I'd make sure I get something nice but not extravagant. \n\nThese aren't real friends, they're users. I think you're asking not because you're wondering if you're an AH for not paying but you're subconsciously wondering what people's opinions are of your friends' behavior.

You didn't speak up until well after that point when everyone was stuck with the bill. \n\nYou also went in with the \"it isn't super fancy, 100\u20ac is a standard meal\". Maybe you're accustomed to expensive dinners but for a lot of folks 100\u20ac or $100 is far from inexpensive and definitely hits the level of special occasion or fancy dinner. \n\nI seldom ever pay more than $50-$70 for myself AND my wife, and I can certainly afford well above that. But that's not a fancy meal or special occasion out. \n\nI don't think there was any maliciousness there, just a lack of communication on all sides and a lot of assumptions that were incorrect on both sides. \n\nLesson here is don't assume, and next time be clear on whether you're paying for everyone or if everyone is responsible for their own bill.", "ESH.

So I do think based on your position in society the smart thing to do, in order to prevent any of the uncertainty would be to say \u201cmy treat, go ahead get steak, I won\u2019t be drinking, but let\u2019s ask if they have anything good they recommend\u2026\u201d.

It's a touchy situation", "Thanks for that.\n\nAnd yes, I would need to talk to them so we are sure this never happens again.", "My friends had never tried to use me before this.\n\nWhen I said other people have tried to use me before, I was mostly referring to people trying to make me invest in their companies or to use me a marketing figure for their purposes.", "Hahahah, if you ever know who I am come to me saying you are Crazy_Pastor, I'll invite you to some cool activity, I promise! \n\nAnd about the things we experience... well you would be very disappointed, we spent most of the day training and resting (right now I'm running on a treadmill \ud83e\udd23).", "Well, yeah, the 400\u20ac bottle was a bit too much \ud83e\udd23", "The misunderstanding is that they thought I was paying when I was not.\n\nIf I offered to pay, I wouldn't mind covering this amount. It's not the quantity, it's the fact that they directly assumed I was paying.", "So covering for them if it\u2019s 200 per person will be the gesture of a good friend. \n\nCovering 500 per person at a place where 200 per person is the norm makes you into (there is a slightly derogatory term in my language that means someone who is being used as a moneybag - and my brain is failing to translate).\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t take advantage of our friends. Even if they are rich, it is not our money.", "This is a good idea and I think this is what I'm going to do.\n\nI'm also going to reimburse them for the dinner, I know that money is a lot for some of them, especially the ones with kids.", "If it helps I don\u2019t think they were trying to use you this time. Especially since they quickly paid a third of their monthly pay for the dinner.", "Hahahaa I\u2019m totally not a soccer person. I know the basic rules because I\u2019m forced to play it as a child in school, and I can name a few teams because my teachers are EPL fans and we get a happy or sad lecturer based on the scores the previous night. \ud83e\udd23\n\nSo I\u2019m pretty sure any story you tell will be totally beyond my world.", "i think you're getting a lot of these responses because in north american culture, if someone else is paying, you should order the cheapest or average thing.\n\nin my culture, if someone else is paying, it's a celebration, and they want you to order what you want, even if its expensive. in fact ordering the cheapest thing is a bit rude, it's like refusing to get into the celebratory mood, or maybe suggesting the host can't really afford it and has over extended themselves.\n\nyou know your friends and your culture best, but it sounds like it didn't feel like they were taking advantage by ordering the most expensive thing, it would have been a normal thing to do if you had invited them out and intended to pay.\n\ni think you should send them the money if you think the cost will be a hardship for them, because that's what a caring friend would do. and then see if they still make time for you in the future and come to dinners where they pay for themselves\n\ni would also consider that, now that they think you are rich, they assume you wouldn't be interested in doing cheaper things like hanging out at someones house. at 1.5k/mth, a 100 dinner is significant. it would be hard to maintain a friendship with someone if they had to always pay 100 to see them. consider suggesting cheap/free things to do, or offering to pay if you want to do something expensive.", "Sounds like a wonderful idea. I'm glad you got it solved", "Thanks for your input"]}
