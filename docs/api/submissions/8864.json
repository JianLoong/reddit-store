Fine, I\u2019m a modern woman, I can do that. \n\nDuring the past year, there were multiple months that he just flat out refused to pay rent or childcare. He said he was broke and couldn\u2019t do it. He also would not buy groceries or household esssentials. Overall I covered between 2/3-3/4 of our total expenses, and I have nearly depleted all my savings in doing so because $35k isn\u2019t enough. \n\nI have also done most of the domestic work because he just doesn\u2019t do it. I can give him a simple tasks like keeping toilet paper stocked, and we ran out over Christmas with guests in the house and he still wouldn\u2019t go out and buy it. \n\nI finally landed a job that pays $55k and started this past January 3rd. Our baby came down with a bug and couldn\u2019t go to daycare, BF refused to help by coming home early so I could work, so I had to tell my job I couldn\u2019t complete my work.

Baby got sick again (it\u2019s that time of year, ugh) and couldn\u2019t go to daycare Monday or Tuesday.

This is my first month at a new job, AND my first week he refused to help me out when I needed it. I\u2019m terrified I\u2019m going to get fired. \n\nI told him that he is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to me and that I think he took this job just to sabotage mine. He thinks I\u2019m overreacting, need to relax, and I can\u2019t expect him to take care of his kid more than an hour or so. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675262786, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qwg56/aita_for_expecting_my_bf_to_care_for_our_child/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

On that note, why would you ever stay with someone who refuses to help out, is cheap and lazy and clearly doesn't want to be a father. If and when you decide to leave him and request child support, you will see that finally the money will start coming in because he won't have a choice.

You didn\u2019t need to get back together and this outcome quite frankly proves it.

Pretty obvious that wanting to be part of the kid's life was BS.", "NTA - He literally does nothing to support you or the child.  Leave him. Then file for child support.", "NTA. File for child support. In some states, child support goes back to the day the baby was born. In others, it only goes back to the day you filed. And with that income disparity, he's going to be paying a lot more in child support than he would have if he'd just helped with groceries and daycare. \n\nAlso, it won't matter if he quits his job. They'll garnish his benefits and, in some states, such as Florida, they'll send him to jail if he makes no attempt to pay his arrears. He'll lose his passport, get liens on his tax returns, have vehicles repossessed, etc. \n\nAlso, if he chooses to get a lower paying job, they'll still assign his child support based on how much he would normally be earning. Courts do not like people who are willfully underemployed. \n\nGood luck.\n\nEdit to add: whether he gets custody time or not (I hope you have in writing that he said he can only watch baby for an hour at a time, because people like this try to use their kids as pawns to hurt their exes, and courts don't like to see parents that said they don't want time with their kids turn around and try to fight for majority of sole custody), you will be less stressed as a single parent than with him. \n\nIANAL", "NTA, but something is wrong if you're not seeing the 'Big Red Flags' everywhere.", "NTA this isn\u2019t what a family looks like.
