She wanted to do a gender reveal, so at her 20 week ultrasound she got the ultrasound technician to write the gender on a piece of paper, put it in an envelope and gave it to me. She wanted me to order those smoke cannons for her, her husband and their kids to pop at a photograph session to reveal what their new baby is going to be. Personally I don\u2019t see the point in them, but it made my friend happy and I felt honoured that she trusted me with such a secret. When she handed me the envelope she made me swear that under no circumstances I would tell her what it is no matter how much she begged, or tell anyone else. I agreed. \n\nFast forward, I\u2019ve had this envelope for 2 weeks now, I\u2019ve ordered the cannons and the gender reveal is in a few days. For the past 2 weeks my friend has HOUNDED me with texts begging me to just tell her what it is, but then following up with \u201cactually no I don\u2019t want to know\u201d. And it\u2019s just been going back and fourth like that. The texts were annoying but I just ignored it and understood she was just excited. But the past 3 days she had begun hounding me at work - I work an office job and I\u2019m in and out of meetings all day. After the first day of a call into my work I asked her to please just chill out and stop calling me at work. I reminded her that she made me promise not to tell and she\u2019d find out soon enough.  \n\nHere is where I may be the asshole, I\u2019d been having a crappy day at work with a particular client being a giant PAITA. I was stuck in a meeting with this client and the receptionist stuck her head in and said I had an urgent phone call, thought it may have been my kids school so I excused myself and took the call. It was my \u201cfriend\u201d AGAIN. I just snapped and told her if she wanted to know so badly it\u2019s a boy!\u201d And then I hung up the phone. My husband thinks I\u2019m in the right because there is only so much one person can take. But our mutual friends are calling me the AH because I should have just kept my mouth shut. \n\nSo AITA? \n\n\nTLDR: my friend hounded me to the point I snapped and told her what gender her baby is before she could do the gender reveal.", "created_utc": 1674262256, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10heezh/aita_for_ruining_my_friends_gender_reveal/", "score": 336, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The calls into my work on the other hand were not expected and I didn\u2019t think even she would go that far. \n\nHindsight is 20/20 lol I should have just given her back the envelope", "YES!  She could have answered her own question so easily just by calling her doctor\u2019s office.  She didn\u2019t really want to know, she just wanted the drama and attention of bugging OP about it.  NTA.", "hahaha my favorite answer, NTA on all accounts", "lmao are these people seriously surprised they created a human male or female?!? what the fuck has the mom been so anxious about that she can\u2019t handle handing a piece of paper to someone?!? did she think it was a lizard or dragon? did she think everyone should be obsessed with her baby\u2019s genitalia above everything else? \n\n\nwho the hell pesters someone for weeks and gets upset that they get an answer?! you should let her know that she\u2019s been waiting for the mom of the pregnant psycho to do a gender reveal and you don\u2019t appreciate finding out she is a female as if there are only a few choices and that disappointment made it clear that she doesn\u2019t care about your feelings in regards to the occasion. then do a gender reveal for moron obsessed with a babies genitals to the point where they are upset to find out the baby has genitalia and self destructs. i hear it\u2019s like circus confetti and it comes with a hysterical idiot who\u2019s lost her mind and a lot of hormones", "These cannons are compressed air, the dust in them is not combustible. They don\u2019t pose a fire hazard.\n\nBut I do agree some of these \u201cgender reveal\u201d options are dangerous", "OPs friend totally ruined her gender reveal herself.\n\nNTA", ">Calls at WORK? You better be dying, because absolutely not.\n\n*Especially* if they tell the receptionist it's urgent!", "My wife calls me at work and leaves a voicemail.  She doesn't call our receptionist and demand to be connected.", "Honestly, after the second tell me!!! text I would have fucking told her. I would have waiting til I say the little bubble that tells me they are typing and had b-o-y pre typed to send right as they sent the \u201cjust kidding\u201d text. I\u2019m not playing this game.", "For sure,  op could have done this the first time she called her work without being the a$$. \nAlso, it's very bad to call and claim an emergency!", "For sure,  you know she told her twisted version of this story to make op look bad.  She doesn't deserve the cannon!", "You've got amazing restraint for not saying \"Surprise! It's a....nnoying, just like you\" then asking the receptionist if it's at all possible to block her number or delay messages from that number", "Does she typically cross boundaries like this with you or anyone else? Calling your work and acting like it was an \u201cemergency\u201d was WAY over the line, bordering on downright unhinged, and I\u2019m not sure anyone would put up with this behavior.", "Yeah, I'd have made it clear I wasn't going to play this silly game. By the 5th go round, I think I'd have lit it on fire in front of her.", "Yeah. Friend was pushy and out of line. \n\nI just wouldn\u2019t have said it if it was me. That\u2019s why I said ES.", "Get some fart cannons.  If they don\u2019t make fart cannons that look like gender reveal cannons, they need to start now.  There\u2019s a market.", "She\u2019s always been \u201cfull on\u201d, I\u2019m not sure how else to describe her. But overall she isn\u2019t a bad person, she just seemed to have lost a few marbles since becoming pregnant. I didn\u2019t know her during her previous pregnancies so I\u2019m not sure what she was like then", "I might not have said, but I sure would have said a lot of other things. Talk about out of line behavior.", "I think there is a reasonable amount of restraint you can expect people to have. OP\u2019s friend\u2019s behavior pushed way past what a person should be expected to put up with when doing a friend a favor. \n\nYou might have handled it differently but I don\u2019t think OP\u2019s response puts her at the level of an AH.", "Oh, yeah me too for sure. I would have had a lot to say, just wouldn\u2019t have said the gender.", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an AH either, I just think she sucks. Haha she could have absolutely told her friend off and even decided she no longer wanted to be the person responsible for it, but I don\u2019t think she should have told the gender.", "Yeah, fair enough. I would've probably long since have handed her back the envelope and told her that I couldn't do the job she'd asked of me if she was going to treat me that way. Then, she could've chosen to give it to someone else herself or to simply maintain her own self-control... but either way, it wouldn't be my problem anymore.", "Exactly the same here!", "Excellent idea."]}
