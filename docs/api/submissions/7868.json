{"id": 7868, "submission_id": "10heezh", "title": "AITA for \u201cruining\u201d my friends gender reveal?", "selftext": "My (27f) friend (29F) is pregnant. She wanted to do a gender reveal, so at her 20 week ultrasound she got the ultrasound technician to write the gender on a piece of paper, put it in an envelope and gave it to me. She wanted me to order those smoke cannons for her, her husband and their kids to pop at a photograph session to reveal what their new baby is going to be. Personally I don\u2019t see the point in them, but it made my friend happy and I felt honoured that she trusted me with such a secret. When she handed me the envelope she made me swear that under no circumstances I would tell her what it is no matter how much she begged, or tell anyone else. I agreed. \n\nFast forward, I\u2019ve had this envelope for 2 weeks now, I\u2019ve ordered the cannons and the gender reveal is in a few days. For the past 2 weeks my friend has HOUNDED me with texts begging me to just tell her what it is, but then following up with \u201cactually no I don\u2019t want to know\u201d. And it\u2019s just been going back and fourth like that. The texts were annoying but I just ignored it and understood she was just excited. But the past 3 days she had begun hounding me at work - I work an office job and I\u2019m in and out of meetings all day. After the first day of a call into my work I asked her to please just chill out and stop calling me at work. I reminded her that she made me promise not to tell and she\u2019d find out soon enough.  \n\nHere is where I may be the asshole, I\u2019d been having a crappy day at work with a particular client being a giant PAITA. I was stuck in a meeting with this client and the receptionist stuck her head in and said I had an urgent phone call, thought it may have been my kids school so I excused myself and took the call. It was my \u201cfriend\u201d AGAIN. I just snapped and told her if she wanted to know so badly it\u2019s a boy!\u201d And then I hung up the phone. My husband thinks I\u2019m in the right because there is only so much one person can take. But our mutual friends are calling me the AH because I should have just kept my mouth shut. \n\nSo AITA? \n\n\nTLDR: my friend hounded me to the point I snapped and told her what gender her baby is before she could do the gender reveal.\n\nEDIT 1: I\u2019ve seen a few people concerned about these \u201ccannons\u201d these aren\u2019t the same type that have caused devastation and loss of life by causing fires. They are pressurised with air and powder inside them in non flammable so they don\u2019t pose any fire hazard. But I completely understand and appreciate people\u2019s concern.\n\nUpdate: finally got one of our mutual friends to respond to me and tell me what they were told. Turns out as another commenter had guessed, they were told a different story, my \u201cfriend\u201d never mentioned the onslaught of texts begging to know or the ringing me multiple times at work they were simply told that \u201cOP couldn\u2019t keep a secret and just had to tell me and ruined the surprise\u201d. \nI honestly don\u2019t know where to go from here, since being able to tell one of the mutual friends what ACTUALLY happened she\u2019s just as pissed as I am. I haven\u2019t heard from my \u201cfriend\u201d except for a text message telling me how I\u2019m such a horrible friend and I shouldn\u2019t have told them. I haven\u2019t responded.", "created_utc": 1674262256, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10heezh/aita_for_ruining_my_friends_gender_reveal/", "score": 12217, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just get the answer from the doctor if you're in that much suspense", "This is exactly why I don't like such parties. It just seems creepy. Babies are essentially genderless. Why do people care about their anatomy? It's irrelevant", "Fun fact, paita means shirt in finnish. I was so confused at that for a second xd", "I knew just from the title that this thread would be 100% NTA because Reddit has such a hate-boner for gender reveal parties, but as soon as the work call happened OP was completely justified in telling her", "Heck, this person shouldn't be having a child, let alone worrying about a reveal.", "I think they are unnecessary but if people want to do them whatever as long as they dont get all cartoonish like Op's friend or the many folks out there that go over the top or require a enviromental impact study", "And OP\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d seems like the type to get upset if their kid turns out to be intersex/to have some sort of sex chromosome disorder. God help the kid if they\u2019re trans or non-binary later on in life.", "I completely agree, I'm pretty neutral on them, in the future when I have kids I'll likely do something small with my partner, like maybe order a cake with the color frosting and we find out together that night. Wouldn't do a party personally but like you said, as long as it's responsible and safe who cares. But putting all that on your friend and then calling them at work and telling them it's urgent - even pregnancy hormones and excitement don't excuse that", "OP should have went the Seth Rogen route and paraphrased knocked up \"ITS A BOY BUY SOME BLUE SHIT!!\""]}
