{"id": 8812, "submission_id": "10qekxh", "title": "AITA for cutting my grandparents out of my life", "selftext": "Several years ago when I was in high school, my father kicked us out of our home and forced us to live with friends to finish out the school year since he had remarried and our stepmother wanted us gone. My grandparents stood behind him in this decision and didn\u2019t do anything to help their grandchildren. They are pretty well off and are super religious. Growing up I always felt like they would use certain Bible verses to justify treating people poorly and I didn\u2019t like that at all. Every time I visited them when I was in college, they would act like it was my fault that my dad wouldn\u2019t try to make amends and I would leave upset every time. At that point i had been trying for several years to make amends with my father, but to no avail. That, added with being abandoned by both parents and the way they acted during that has made me just keep to myself and prioritize spending time with family members who do make me feel loved and welcomed. I don\u2019t reach out to them, but they also don\u2019t reach out to me either. Our relationship has been strained for 8 years, and for the first 5 I did try to maintain one with them, but it just felt so one-sided that I stopped being the first person to reach out. The only contact I have with them is doing the bookkeeping for the church they help run. They called me today to initially talk about the books but then asked me why I never come around or why I \u201chate them\u201d. I do work a lot and live 4 hours away, and when I mentioned that, they said they were tired of excuses.

Damn. \n\nI don't care who is blood related to you, you don't owe anyone anything. You're NTA for protecting yourself from people who are cruel and don't seem to actually give two craps about you unless they need something from you. \n\nFamily is choice, not just blood.", "NTA. You could just as easily ask them why they never ask to visit or why they hated you enough to kick you out in high school. \n\nWhy bother trying to maintain contact at all?", "NTA. You need to protect yourself from toxicity and they are that definition of toxic.", "NTA AT ALL. They want to treat you like shit and use their religion as an excuse to bully others. They basically said it was your fault your dad abandoned you. What did they expect? That they can treat you that way and think you'll come back when they need something?  \n\nFuck them. They're toxic as fuck. You did the right thing by prioritizing yourself. Toxic people always want to play victim especially when the consequences of their shitty behavior kick them in the face.", "Nta. Raise your fee.", "NTA\n\nYou have nothing to make amends for concerning your father nor his parents. They don't even really see you as family tbh. Might do you some good to spell out exactly how their actions led to this situation but you don't OWE them that.", "NTA. You do not owe them your time, your presence, or your explanations. They can ask. You don't have to answer.\n\nBut if you choose to do so, don't hold back. Tell them exactly why. And if they try to blame you, remind them that they were the adults in these scenarios, and they were and still are the AH.", "NTA. They're lucky that you still help out with their church's books. Unfortunately, they won't see they're part of this-ever. Protect yourself.", "NTA but your family are. Go NC with all of them, they are all terrible people!", "NTA. These people run a church?! Why do you hate them?  Maybe because they condoned your father abandoning you? I\u2019m shocked you haven\u2019t cut them out of your life a long time ago. Nasty nasty people.", "NTA. A great man once said: \"families... you can't live with 'em, you can't unalive 'em\".", "If keeping the books is a volunteer position, stop. Go NC for your own wellbeing, so long as it won\u2019t negatively impact your relationship with the other relatives that make you feel loved. If it will, LC.\n\nNTA", "NTA, your father and grandparents most certainly are though. You do not owe either your father or grandparents any type of amends for their past behavior. Nor do you owe them access to you and your life other than that which you choose to allow.", "Nta\n\nThey are gaslighting you.", "NTA \n\nIs this the first time they asked you about this?  Did they come and see you at all?\n\nThe answers to these questions do not really matter however if they are toxic.\n\nThe correct answer to their question of why you don\u2019t come around is that they weren\u2019t there for you when your dad abandoned you and you needed them, then they don\u2019t deserved to have you around when things are better.\n\nFamily is not genetics.  You can be related to your sperm donor and his egg and sperm donor and not consider them family.  \n\nFamily are people who lift you up, welcome you when you are around you and support you in times of needs. Sounds like the people who happen to share your genetic material don\u2019t do any of those things.\n\nGo NC with them and tell them if they can\u2019t act like family when you needed them, they don\u2019t get to claim you as family when you don\u2019t need them.", "You are NTA here.  They are.  You did nothing wrong.  I would give up the bookkeeping, cut all contact, and move on with your life.  They weren't there when you needed them.  Now you don't so why should you give them what they want.  Tell them exactly hownthey've made you feel than tell them to take a flying leap.", "They're tired of excuses?  What's their excuse for not reaching out to you?  Def NTA. Even if they do reach out, maybe tell them the truth, their judgmental attitude makes you want to be far away from them, and that if they can hold their judgmental tongues you would like to meet maybe for a lunch or something and give it a try.  You need to prioritize your own mental health.", "NTA.\n\nBit of advice, make sure your grandparents weren't fed lies by your father in order to make you look bad, they may be going off false information.", "NTA. These people may be blood relatives,  but they are not family. Next time they bring it up just be blunt - they supported your father in kicking you out because he could not be bothered by living up to his responsibilities And you are done with them. I would also stop supporting their church.", "NTA and it really sounds like you should visit /raisedbynarcissists \u2014 you should consider cutting everybody out, not just the randparents. Toxicity kills.", "NTA You don't owe them anything.  \n\nTell them the truth that they abandoned you when you needed them the most and that communication is a 2 way street, and while they are possibly now retired your an adult who needs to work, beca8e your father and his parents have shown you that they'll never help you and the only person that you can rely on is yourself. \n\nAlso inform them effective immediately that they need to find someone else to do the books for their church because you'd rather not deal with hypocrites anymore, because they definitely don't practice what they preach.\n\nThen for your own peace of mind go no contact.", "OP, I am so sorry to read what happened to you years ago and am appalled at the way they behaved towards you. You are NTA for putting distance and having little to no contact to protect your mental and emotional health\n\nOP, what they did is unholy and hypocritical towards you. I hope you are undergoing counselling or therapy to help you heal. You do you and this was and is not your fault. Continue doing what is right for you", "NTA but you need to be done with all of them. Stop wasting time and energy on people who refuse to love and respect you.", "INFO:\n\nYour grandparents and father are assholes. That said, the fact that you're saying you've been \"abandoned\" by both of your parents, your grandparents, and your step mom makes it seem a bit sus as though there is something you're not telling us about your own behaviors.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But why even do their book keeping?", "Thank you all - you\u2019ve reinforced my choice to go no contact with them and to stop doing the books for them. I\u2019ve made my own family away from them, I\u2019m happy, and realize what happened is not my fault. I appreciate you guys!", "Spot on here.  I find it disgusting that they \u201crun a church\u201d. OP shouldn\u2019t even do the books and never talk to these people again.", "Yeah - I originally tried to do it to be the bigger person, but then it just became too exhausting", "Yep NTA, it's pretty obvious they don't see OP or others as equal, how could you treat your family so poorly?", "Yes it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve asked about it, and no they haven\u2019t. They always expect me to call or text them first and put forth the effort to make plans with them", "My mother left due to having an affair, my father remarried and his new wife had a daughter that she wanted him to focus on raising. He tried to give custody of my sister and I back to my mother, but they lived out of state at the time and also didn\u2019t have the financial means to take care of us. I hope this is helpful - I was the definition of a goody-goody in school (math team, band nerd, I privately tutored my peers in math and wasn\u2019t a wild kid)", "I'm worried at your use of the phrase \"make amends\" - YOU have nothing to make amends for, I hope you realize!", "Then just don\u2019t reach out.  They seem to cause you stress and if they are not contributing to your well being, you don\u2019t owe them anything.  If they want a relationship make them work for it.  \n\nSo go NC and if you hear from them, answer in a way your comfortable with.  If you want to tell them how you feel, go for it. If not, just keep either making excuses or let them know when you will be home for them to visit.  Don\u2019t make it a negotiation, just say oh, you want to catch up, I will be home Sunday afternoon if you want to stop by.  Gotta go, see you.", "That sucks, mate. So sorry to hear. Wouldn't be surprised at all that you want to cut all of these people out of your life. Best of luck and NTA.", "I do now! It took therapy for me to realize none of it was my fault and once I got there I stopped trying", "Good! Take care.", "OP, I passed you judgement. This is never your fault and I am so sorry that you endured so much hell because of them. You did right on yourself protecting you", "NTA. \n\nI would suggest asking them why they think you hate them? Be interesting to hear their perspective. Might also get you insight into what was going on back then.", "NTA\n\n\nAm actually surprised you were calm when talking to them. I would have gone berserk on them for their bs..", "more like the definition of bible thumpers", "Honestly that\u2019s not a bad idea. I know they are pretty bad about holding onto the past and they believe other family members have influenced my opinion of them so it seems to me like a very narcissistic/paranoid streak going on. They care a lot about how they are perceived", "I\u2019d suggest keeping them at telephone length too. Good luck. Hope you\u2019re able to find some answers \ud83e\udd1d"]}
