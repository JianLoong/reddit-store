Lidia wanted to come live with us when she was little, but once she was about 15, her tune changed. We thought that it was because she was getting old enough to where her mother's (lack of) rules and structure was less scary and more to her benefit, so we pressed on. He finally won last spring shortly after she turned 17, and we brought her home shortly after.\n\nIt's been a disaster. She doesn't want to be here. She doesn't know anyone here besides her father. There's a huge language barrier, so she can't really talk to us, let alone make friends here. Those would be big enough issues on their own, but it's nothing compared to the practical issues.\n\nShe's supposed to have dual citizenship, but that either doesn't mean anything or it works differently than any advice we've gotten. Back in her home country, she was a senior in high school, and had already been accepted to several universities. She had some kind of driver's license. Here in America, all of that is meaningless. We can't get her even a learner's permit because her \"paperwork isn't right\". What's happening with school though...\n\nWe had heard that the credit transfer would be behind, but every school we've talked to would put her as a sophomore at best. This not only means that she can't graduate this year, but she'd be in high school until she's **20(?!)**.\n\nShe could get a GED, but that's looked down on by colleges here. We've looked into online, but the online options are viewed about the same or worse than a GED. If we were millionaires, we could just donate to some school to just give her a degree, but we aren't.\n\nSo by moving here, instead of graduating this year and going to college, she has to be in high school into her 20s or she can't go to college at all. \n\nThere is an option of sending her back home to live with her mother's friends to just graduate and get it over with and then come back. She'd have to make sure she was back in class there before April, but she'd only have a semester to make up so she could feasibly graduate on time. A high school degree from her home country would equal out, so she could go to college here with no issue.\n\nMy husband won't hear it. He thinks she'll run away and never come back. He's adamant that there has to be another option and that everyone is just \"going off of emotion\". 20 schools, 3 lawyers, and tens of thousands of dollars later, I don't think so. I think this might be the only option and that we're running out of time to take advantage of it.

Ask her what you can do to help her get back to her family and do it. \n\nIt might be wrong to lie, but it will be far better for her in the long run to go home than to stay there and let your husband ruin her life. \n\nOnce she's safely back in her country you should rethink this felationship. Especially if he's willing to ruin a child's whole future just so he can claim that he \"won\" some imaginary contest. \n\nHelp her get back home any way you can and fast, ignoring your husband's wants.", "Yeah. I have friends that adopted a baby from Guatemala. They discovered when he was 14 that the paperwork never went through and he wasn't a citizen. What a f--- mess.", "He needs to realize that he has less than a year left until she turns 18 and if he is determined to screw her over until then that is all the time he is ever going to have with her because she will justifiably hate him, and she will leave and not come back as soon as she is able.  Would he rather have a few months with her or a lifetime?", "Then do whatever you need to do to help her get home. Then divorce this jerk. \n\nYour husband doesn't just get to ruin her life because he wants to control her. \n\nIts not good to lie, but this is one instance when lying is far better. When your saving her and saving her future. \n\nI dont know why he's pushing so hard to keep her in America, but he doesn't sound like he has good intentions. Im betting she feels like a prisoner in your home. \n\nHelp her get home and fast.", "Buy her a plane ticket and put her on a plane Op. Send her to her mom.\n\nDon\u2019t let your husband ruin her future. She had a life at home, goals and was on her way to being an adult. In the US, nothing. \n\nNTA", "You\u2019re NTA but your husband sure as hell is. Tens of THOUSANDS of dollars and he STILL won\u2019t listen to reason?

She want to go and would do so much better there, but none of that seems to matter to him.", "Has anyone actually asked the daughter what she wants?", "Moving to a whole new life at 17 is different than moving when you are 4 or 5. I can understand her problem.  If she is to stay, I would recommend talking to the admissions officer at a state university. Explain the situation and discuss the option of her being admitted with a GED. Many state universities will make concessions to enroll students of diversity.", "NTA. What does he think is going to happen when she turns 18 and can legally tell him to go screw?  \nYour husband is doing this to spite his ex wife. That's the only thing I can think of. He doesn't care about Lidia, that's for certain. This is epic tantrum on his part, and the damage he's doing is irrelevant to him.", "NTA. Has anyone asked this girl what she wants? At 17, she's entitled to make decisions about her own life. With guidance, for sure, but ultimately, the decision should be hers. Y W B T A if you allowed your husband to keep pushing his agenda ahead of his daughter's wellbeing.", "NTA but your husband is", "Can you give her a homeschool diploma? As long as she has enough credits to meet the state standards. Sophia.com is fast and has the major subjects. The credits would be dual credit and she could transfer in to a state university as a sophomore with 24 hours. Another idea is to have her take dual credit classes at a community college. I would think  outside the box. It's way easier to get her into college than a get a degree from a local high school.", "YTA -or rather, your controlling husband is. Of course she e3eds to go home and decide what SHE wants to do. Poor young woman. This is abusive.", "NTA. He uprooted his daughter and basically ruined her future right at the tail end of being a minor before becoming an adult. She had everything set up in her home country to succeed and he decided he didn\u2019t care what she wanted. What he did was cruel. He didn\u2019t even bother to spend the last 17 years learning the language she speaks. \n\nWhat a terrible situation you\u2019re in, I\u2019m so sorry OP. I hope he comes to his senses soon.", "Has anyone asked what she wanted?", "And think you guys need to talk with her about it and let her decide what options she wants to take. If she has buy in on the plan then maybe she\u2019ll be happier. I mean that is why all this has meaning right? Her Dad is the one operating on emotion only.  NTA", "Your husband is deeply cruel to do this to his daughter. I doubt she will forgive him if he doesn\u2019t fix it before her birthday.", "NTA. She\u2019s old enough to decide for herself. He will never see her again if he tries to force her.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn\u2019t want to be in a new country at one of the MOST significant times in her formative years. She deserves to be where she wants. \n\nHusband is MAJOR A-Hole for dragging her here against her will.", "Pleasenrepirt him to CPS.", "Per OP she wants to go home.", "Then do what you can and send her back", "Of course she does.", "I don't know where to begin. You and your husband are so clueless about language, education, rospects, meeting the complex rules of travel between countries. And her interests and needs. Please do your best to remedy this horror story asap, before an educator, neighbour or socialmworker acts.", "This. This right here.\n\nDo not ignore this. She IS her own person, with her own mind, despite his determination to see her only as a reflection of himself, and she WILL hate him and he WILL lose her. This incident has only *exposed* it, it's a problem regardless, and the outcome is *inevitable*. You cannot fix it. You probably cannot even delay it. This was in motion before you got here, and you need to get out of the way, or be crushed.\n\nHe's not rational or reasonable. And that's REALLY important for you to absorb. This man believes he needs to be in control, and cannot accept when he's not, even up to the bitter end, even when it gains him nothing and could cost him everything.", "Why would she?", "Literally no, because she was adamant about not wanting to come and nobody listened.", "You sound really empathetic and caring for her. So please don\u2019t take offense at this. \n\nIn addition to all the other mess of school, driving, friends, etc this has caused, she is living with you, who as kind and nice and concerned as you sound, cannot even talk to her. \n\nI mean, getting a stepparent at any age is challenging, but I don\u2019t know how much she even knows you and you two can\u2019t even really communicate?\n\nI hope your husband listens to you. And I hope one day you and her can form a nice bond because you seem to be the only one here in the US that is truly thinking of her best interests.", "I know. The daughter is at a huge loss. Staying in high school until she's 20 will be a waste of 3-4 years, combined with the language barrier and lack of social life is bound to make her feel lonely as ever. OP's husband should get over his ego and do what's best for the kid even if it means sending her back. NTA", "\"He's adamant that there has to be another option and that everyone is just \"going off of emotion\"\".  \n  Your husband is the one going off of emotion.  What he's doing is absolutely not  in his daughter's best interest... academically, socially, personally... it's entirely for HIMSELF.  Your stepdaughter will suffer because of his selfishness, but probably not for long... only as long as it takes to get the heck away from him and go back to her home country (and good luck with her ever wanting anything to do with him again afterwards.)  \n\n\nYou're NTA.  Your stepdaughter... is entirely a victim here, and your husband is being a world class AH to his own daughter.", "NTA she\u2019s old enough to figure out where she wants to stay and she does not want to stay with your husband and you and you\u2019re forcing her. What do you think is gonna happen when she turns 18 she\u2019s got a run.", "First of all your wrong about the GED. She can still get into a good college. At the very least she can for sure do community college for a few years then transfer for a full time program. However NTA I think your approach is logical", "NTA", "If you are in the US, I don't think the universities here are worth it anymore.  For example, in Europe, you can go to medical school and law school right after high school, but in the US, you need a bachelor's and then you can go to get your MD or JD.  It's not just that; university education has seriously declined in the past 20 years, especially in the past 10.  And it's very expensive.  And I say this as someone who loves learning.    \n\n\nSomeone needs to have a heart to heart with the girl to figure out what SHE wants to do.  Maybe an unbiased, respected third party like a counselor or a priest.  That way, this person can make sure your husband hears what she's saying.", "As soon as she\u2019s 18 she\u2019ll be gone anyway and will never speak to her father again for screwing up her life.", "You're NTA, but your husband is. Tell him if he doesn't want to lose his daughter forever, let her go back to get her high school diploma. You and your husband can emphasize later that getting college degree in the US will be more beneficial for her wherever she wants to spend her life, thus making it clear that if later she wants to go back to her home country, she can, and employers there might find her US degree attractive. If during her college years she finds living in the US is better, then I'm sure your husband will be very happy.\n\nThis is all with assumption that your husband will finance her education and that he didn't work so hard to get custody just to kick her out when she's 18", "She is absolutely miserable here. Someone needs to take what SHE wants into account. Especially since she is practically grown. 18 is considered an adult in the US.

That is so stupid. Here in America also, I work with the afghan refugees and so many of the kids haven\u2019t gone to school or did very little and they got put in the grades that correlate to their ages but get extra help with ESL and other staff to get them caught up.", "Then you need to do the decent thing and give her the money to buy a plane ticket.", "It was a mistake. Quite frankly, all of this paperwork stuff (highschool, college applications, etc) should have been taken into consideration before she got to the US. \nYour husband is literally ruining her future out of spite? Ego? Power trip?\n\nShe is 17? If she has any intelligence, she will save money and buy a plane ticket back the second she is 18 and just lose one year and a half of her life instead of 3 or 4 or more. \n\nPoor girl.", "i would've been *pissed* if I had been uprooted and moved to a different town in the middle of high school. I cannot even imagine how furious I would've been if I got dragged to a different country with a language barrier and all my college plans vaporized, for no good reason.", "And what are the odds of that happening? He has made it very clearly that the only thing that he cares about himself... his feelings, his victory in the legal custody fight, him, him, him.  He doesn't actually seem to care at all about his daughter."]}
