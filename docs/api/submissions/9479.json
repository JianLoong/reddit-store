Lidia wanted to come live with us when she was little, but once she was about 15, her tune changed. We thought that it was because she was getting old enough to where her mother's (lack of) rules and structure was less scary and more to her benefit, so we pressed on. He finally won last spring shortly after she turned 17, and we brought her home shortly after.\n\nIt's been a disaster. She doesn't want to be here. She doesn't know anyone here besides her father. There's a huge language barrier, so she can't really talk to us, let alone make friends here. Those would be big enough issues on their own, but it's nothing compared to the practical issues.\n\nShe's supposed to have dual citizenship, but that either doesn't mean anything or it works differently than any advice we've gotten. Back in her home country, she was a senior in high school, and had already been accepted to several universities. She had some kind of driver's license. Here in America, all of that is meaningless. We can't get her even a learner's permit because her \"paperwork isn't right\". What's happening with school though...\n\nWe had heard that the credit transfer would be behind, but every school we've talked to would put her as a sophomore at best. This not only means that she can't graduate this year, but she'd be in high school until she's **20(?!)**.\n\nShe could get a GED, but that's looked down on by colleges here. We've looked into online, but the online options are viewed about the same or worse than a GED. If we were millionaires, we could just donate to some school to just give her a degree, but we aren't.\n\nSo by moving here, instead of graduating this year and going to college, she has to be in high school into her 20s or she can't go to college at all. \n\nThere is an option of sending her back home to live with her mother's friends to just graduate and get it over with and then come back. She'd have to make sure she was back in class there before April, but she'd only have a semester to make up so she could feasibly graduate on time. A high school degree from her home country would equal out, so she could go to college here with no issue.\n\nMy husband won't hear it. He thinks she'll run away and never come back. He's adamant that there has to be another option and that everyone is just \"going off of emotion\". 20 schools, 3 lawyers, and tens of thousands of dollars later, I don't think so. I think this might be the only option and that we're running out of time to take advantage of it. As much as I also want her here and want her in this family, this is the wrong time and we shouldn't have pressed for her to come here in the first place.

Legally she will not be a child much longer and when she turns 18, I hope she gets to an embassy to go home. \n\nYou have a prisoner not a daughter. You\u2019ve uprooted her entire life for what you wanted not what was best. \n\nBecause she was thriving in school, driving, and early acceptance into universities.
