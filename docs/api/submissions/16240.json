My child has mentioned a few things throughout the year but nothing too alarming. I\u2019ve noticed an uptick in her anxiety levels over the last few months, but attributed it to her father\u2019s absence due to his job and the transition from 2nd to 3rd grade. I have gradually watched my baby go from a model student who was excited to go to school and loved learning, to a shell of her former self. She is now someone who wakes up with stomach pains daily, cries or pleads not to have to go, and says she hates school. She also explodes daily when she comes home and started having panic attacks at drop off.\n\nI started her in therapy and after her first session her therapist said she was dealing with severe anxiety and seemed to be dealing with a toxic or abusive environment at school. I was shocked.  Of course she told me a few comments here and there but never really went into detail even when asked. I tried to let her come to me on her own time which she did, but I discovered she was downplaying the incidents to protect her teacher and avoid retaliation. Last Friday my 5th grader came home and told me a classmate of my 3rd grader told her the teacher had been gossiping about my daughters personal business with the entire class the week she was out with the stomach flu as well as questioning the validity of her illness. She also pulled my 5th grader aside to ask if her sister \u201cwas actually sick this time?\u201d. \n\nUpon hearing this information I decided to ask my 3rd grader more detailed questions and she finally divulged all she\u2019s been dealing with this school year. My heart broke for her. On Monday I kept her home and sent the principal a strongly worded email demanding an investigation and that they take action or I was withdrawing my 3 kids from their school as I now do not feel they are safe. The next day my daughters class was switched and the teacher was reprimanded verbally and was told she is no longer allowed to speak to my 8yr old. Several students corroborated my child\u2019s accusations. My daughter was happy with the outcome and that she no longer had to see or speak to this teacher. I let her know how proud of her I was for being brave. \n\nThe principal suggested we just put a spin on the situation and say the reason was due to \u201creshuffling of students\u201d. I disagreed and thought the other classmate\u2019s parents should know so I sent out a mass email letting them know why my daughter was removed from the class. One of the other parents reached out to the school to confirm and I got a call from the principal basically berating me.

She started punishing him for things(taking recess from him)that we later found out because an aide spoke up, was untrue, that he never did the things she accused him of. She traumatized him so much that we had to pull him from school the rest of the year because he would have meltdowns every morning and cry because he didn\u2019t want to go. During the next few years she would always try to talk to him and he would shake if he saw her. I had to call the school TWICE and threaten violence before she finally left him alone.

Of course if I ignored what she said, she failed me for doing that. I was an A student and she taught my best subject--and it only started being a problem after she found out I had missed school due to an anxiety disorder. If my mom contacted her about anything, she made me stay after class and berated me for being \"a baby\" and yelled at me that she didn't want to hear from my parents. One of my friends who was in the other class for that subject told me she had done the same thing to his older brother, and that she would pick out 1-2 kids in a class to act like this with while being \"cool\" to everyone else so people wouldn't believe the kids she singled out.\n\nMy mom asked for a meeting with her and me to talk about why I was suddenly doing so badly in her class and what we could do to work on it. The teacher freaked out and demanded her department head and the principal be there. My mom was like \"okay lady, your call,\" and brought my dad as a witness. \n\nFortunately for me, the teacher basically went berserk in this meeting in front of everyone, my mom started yelling back at her and had to walk out, and my dad just sat there, looked at the principal, and said \"so you're moving my daughter to the other class section of honors, right?\" and the principal was like. yes. that is...yep. \n\nWhen one of my little sister's friends was assigned to this woman's class, my mom made sure to tell her. \"It'll sound crazy and like your daughter is making it up, but she's not. This really happened and she's done it before.\" \n\nGetting this on record and exposing this teacher's behavior is GOOD--what if she tried it with another kid when your daughter moved classes, or next year? I had a horrible time dealing with this when I was 15-- I can't imagine being 8 and having this happening. Good for you. You 100% did the right thing.

Crazy.", "NTA \n\nOP, your actions remind me of the four times my own parents went mama and papa bear on the school administration. \n\n1. When I was in kindergarten and my school tried to put me in speech therapy, occupational therapy for messy handwriting, and some other kind of therapy through the school because back then if the kid was in 3 or more therapies through the school, they were automatically put in in the special education classes. My dad, who's the calmest guy in the world, spoke up and said firmly 'no speech therapy, no occupational therapy, no *aromatherapy*, no therapy.' I did have to go to speech therapy but it was outside of the school. \n2. I was in seventh grade and my math grade was supposed to be a B but my teacher gave me a C for the final grade. I knew it was supposed to be a B because my teacher wrote on the final test that was what it was supposed to be but we'd had issues with that teacher earlier in the year. My parents tried to get someone to correct it but it was summer. The superintendent said as much and my dad responded that if my grade wasn't changed, his next call was going to be to the local news about how the only known atheist in the public school was being persecuted. Grade was changed in a week. \n3. I was in ninth grade and was being made fun of because I couldn't reach the hook to put the bathroom pass up. I'd asked the teacher if I could just put it on the table in front of the hook (which yes, made it much more difficult for my 4'9\" ass to reach the freaking hook) and I got comments about that. And when I say I was being made fun of, the other kids would pretend to be me and jump when they put the bathroom pass back and the teacher *saw*. Anyway it all came to a head over Thanksgiving after I'd failed a test and my mom asked me what was wrong and I told her everything. After break, my teacher said he wouldn't be in after Christmas because he was going to follow his dreams and become a cop. \n4. Bullied again, 10th grade. This time it was in Journalism class and my mom emailed the teacher to rake him over the coals for his 'Lord of the Flies' classroom. The teacher tried to argue back and my mom said 'perhaps I didn't make myself clear' to which my teacher said 'Oh you've made yourself clear.' \n\nAnyway, this very long comment is just to say you are very much not the AH and your kids are going to be thankful that they've got a mom like you on their side. \n\nAlso, just a tip, if you're in the US and your kid goes to a public school, the media promise works like a charm :D", "NTA. Take it up with the superintendent.\n\nNot really the same situation with me, but I am an older sister (6 years difference), and my sister was once getting bullied in middle school over her weight, face, etc., and just fucked up things.

I studied my sister's school's public policies, codes, and just the entire law and ethics of bullying in my state and went back and asked to speak to the vice principal.

There had been a flu going around, and when a friend of mine said she didn't feel well, this teacher wouldn't let her go to the bathroom or to the nurse (this was a common thing with this teacher). 10 minutes later, my friend threw up in class. It was a huge mess, my friend was humiliated, and rather than send her to the nurse, this teacher shouted at her until Kirstie was curled up in the fetal position and sobbing. I told my mother, who got on the phone with some of the other mothers.
