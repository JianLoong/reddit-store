My child has mentioned a few things throughout the year but nothing too alarming. I\u2019ve noticed an uptick in her anxiety levels over the last few months, but attributed it to her father\u2019s absence due to his job and the transition from 2nd to 3rd grade. I have gradually watched my baby go from a model student who was excited to go to school and loved learning, to a shell of her former self. She is now someone who wakes up with stomach pains daily, cries or pleads not to have to go, and says she hates school. She also explodes daily when she comes home and started having panic attacks at drop off.\n\nI started her in therapy and after her first session her therapist said she was dealing with severe anxiety and seemed to be dealing with a toxic or abusive environment at school. I was shocked.  Of course she told me a few comments here and there but never really went into detail even when asked. I tried to let her come to me on her own time which she did, but I discovered she was downplaying the incidents to protect her teacher and avoid retaliation. Last Friday my 5th grader came home and told me a classmate of my 3rd grader told her the teacher had been gossiping about my daughters personal business with the entire class the week she was out with the stomach flu as well as questioning the validity of her illness. She also pulled my 5th grader aside to ask if her sister \u201cwas actually sick this time?\u201d. \n\nUpon hearing this information I decided to ask my 3rd grader more detailed questions and she finally divulged all she\u2019s been dealing with this school year. My heart broke for her. On Monday I kept her home and sent the principal a strongly worded email demanding an investigation and that they take action or I was withdrawing my 3 kids from their school as I now do not feel they are safe. The next day my daughters class was switched and the teacher was reprimanded verbally and was told she is no longer allowed to speak to my 8yr old. Several students corroborated my child\u2019s accusations. My daughter was happy with the outcome and that she no longer had to see or speak to this teacher. I let her know how proud of her I was for being brave. \n\nThe principal suggested we just put a spin on the situation and say the reason was due to \u201creshuffling of students\u201d. I disagreed and thought the other classmate\u2019s parents should know so I sent out a mass email letting them know why my daughter was removed from the class. One of the other parents reached out to the school to confirm and I got a call from the principal basically berating me. I told her as a parent I have every right to warn other parents about the teachers behavior that is directly affecting their children as well.

This sounds like a school that needs to clean house. This teacher was allowed to terrorize at least one student for years and she wasn't stopped.\n\nDon't go mama bear. Go enraged grizzly bear. Go scorched earth.\n\nNTA.\n\nEdit: BTW, I STRONGLY recommend you consult a lawyer. This is a big deal. Your daughter might be scarred for life.", "NTA! \n\nI'm an ex-teacher.

Take it as high as you need that teacher needs to not be a teacher any more.", "NTA \n\nprincipals usually are worried about how these things reflect on them and how unaware they were to what was happening in their school, idk how it works where you live but if you have a trustee (an elected official) go to them instead. The superintendent is usually more inclined to protect a teacher or principal than a trustee is, because a trustee (or whatever named position) are elected in they usually will gain more traction and are more willing to reprimand appropriately. \n\nWtg on protecting your kid and trying to protect other kids too!", "Obviously NTA. As someone who was horribly mistreated by a teacher at that age, I wish my parents had done something to help me. Even when I told my mom exactly what was going on she didn't do a thing to make sure I was safe. She should have at the very least spoken up and found another school  for me. You were warning the other parents about a person trying to cover up abuse. That's perfectly reasonable.", "NTA! They're just upset because now their incompetence is on display and their jobs are on the line.

You were only doing the right thing by reporting this teacher, and sticking up for your child and other potential children that this teacher has (assumingly) done the same to in the past. The school should have done so much better / done more to handle this situation, especially since you felt that your children aren't safe anymore. I hope that the school does something that is actually affective coming forward. \n\nI hope you aren't second-guessing yourself, because like I said, you are doing the right thing.

Are these even adults your dealing with?", "poor baby, no little child should have to go through that level of stress and anguish. NTA at all, take it as far as necessary.", "NTA. At all. Good on you for taking the safety of all those kids into your hands, since there was clearly nobody looking out for them at that school.", "NTA. Talk to a lawyer. Let the lawyer talk to o the school and its administration. The fact that they removed the teacher is a massive red flag.", "NTA thank you for letting the other parents know what this awful teacher is doing. I highly doubt it was limited to just your kid. The principal is just trying to save face. You don't need permission to share your child's experience from anyone.", "NTA I was mistreated by teachers when I was 7 and 8. Protect that child. Some of those scars last a long time if not forever to some degree.", "NTA - a very simular thing happened to me when i was in fourth grade and like your kid, I didn't mention it to my parents as I thought that it is ok for grown ups to yell and berate kids, let alone in front of an entire class. My parents only found out by accident when my mother went to collect me early and overheard what my teacher was saying.  That night my mother reported what had been going on after i fessed up. It is a scary and isolating ordeal that a kid could go through, especially when they are trying to get good grades and to learn.   \nGood for you for letting other parents know.   \nSchool sucked.", "NTA\n\nI am a teacher, and I say fuck that principal. Go right to the superintendent.", "NTA! This is why schools are so awful. They sweep this stuff under the rug and keep crappy teachers like this around. The principal just didn\u2019t want to deal with it. But parents absolutely have a right to know.", "NTA, but that might not necessarily be a good move as you/your daughter might now be targets for retaliation from the school administration since the principal is probably not happy that you went behind their back. Unless other parents come forward about this teacher targeting their kids, the teacher will most likely not face any further disciplinary action. I\u2019m assuming this is a public school in the US and it\u2019s very hard to get a teacher fired here if they\u2019re Union.", "NTA do you work at the school? I assume not so it really doesn't matter if the principle wanted to release lies about the situation. You told the other parents as you thought they should be made aware of the situation. Considering the principle wanted to lie and then berated you I would take it further and by the sounds of it the entire school needs investigating!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My teacher treated me awfully (example; she said I'd fail a project about parents because I asked what to do since my dad was dead \ud83d\ude43). \nThe next year, my brother was in her class and he frequently came home crying or was too scared to go to school in the mornings like your daughter. Just one old lady completely shattered our trust towards teachers and even in my 30s, I still remember some of the things she said.\n\nIn my case, the teacher was tenured and had been teaching for a long time. As a result, the complaints my mom made were brushed off and kept quiet. I think if we had grown up in an age of social media or at the very least, could contact the parents of our classmates, my mom would have done exactly what you did.\n\nIf your child was too scared to talk about it in detail, then she's likely not the only one. You reaching out to the other parents might have given another kid the chance to speak up. Shame on the principal for trying to sweep this under the rug.", "NTA\n\nThe school is prioritizing its own reputation over the well being and education of their students.

Also if you're in the US you can contact the states licensing board and file a complaint on the teacher", "Ooh this is a really great perspective.

I wish I would\u2019ve actually listened.", "Lmao i appreciate the honesty lol thank you.", "The principal said she felt we had an understanding because I didn\u2019t object during our meeting, and I didn\u2019t but once I got home I realized that they tried to manipulate me and my daughter with a nice story to tell everyone of why she was taken out of the classroom and spin it as it being \u201cfor her privacy\u201d if other kids asked.", "Ooh very true, I hadn\u2019t thought about next year!", "And to think this school is the best district in the state \ud83d\ude43 clearly only according to test scores.", "If the school district wants to have a PR (and legal) nightmare on their hands, then they should retaliate.\n\nOther students have corroborated her story, so they end up fighting the community, not just one parent.\n\nThey don't have to fire that teacher, but they would be idiots to cause more problems for the victims", "All too often schools abuse their forced role in our children's lives with no accountability. Parents need to not accept this.", "No, go to the superintendent. Something fishy is going on. Good for you for sticking up for your kids!", "And leave the next years 3rd graders and their parents unaware of what\u2019s going on\u2026basically giving her a class of fresh victims without parents knowing her history.", "Ooh, she should go John Carpenter's The Thing on them!", "Mmm, a polar bear is good, but they're ambush fighters. Built to expend all their energy in one short attack. Grizzlies have been observed running to chase down prey for miles. They're endurance fighters, and OP has a prolonged fight against her. \n\nReally, we've gotten to the most important issue of all. A grizzly can kick a polar bear's butt any day :)", "That principal is only trying to avoid a lawsuit. A teacher verbally abused a student and they remain employed?\n\nThey\u2019re hoping you remain silent.", "Just because you didn't express any objections during the meeting does not mean you're not allowed to later process the conversation and draw previously unreached conclusions from it.\n\nIf you'd actively agreed and then turned around and emailed the other parents, that would be a different story. But silence does not equal agreement.\n\nAnd if you'd concluded that the principal's goal was spin and cya, why would you bother discussing it with her again? It would just give her more time to manipulate things.", "Sounds like this school has stayed at the top by bullying both the students and parents into not publicizing their mistreatments. I wish the principle had berated you over email instead, and then you could\u2019ve took it to board of education. Berating parents for not allowing their children to be mistreated is probably frowned upon by the board, especially since it makes the entire district look bad.", "Wow the perspective of this! Thank you.", "A human with submachine gun beats a polar and grizzly bear every day of the week.", "Ooh some of you are really making excellent points and validating my decision. My daughter is still trying to protect her and doesn\u2019t think she should lose her job because it doesn\u2019t happen all the time. It truly breaks my heart because she doesn\u2019t understand that\u2019s what abusers do and she\u2019s so empathetic and caring she doesn\u2019t even want someone who hurt her in trouble.", "I think even if I agreed I still have the right to realize I was being manipulated and change my mind later on.", "Yes at the end of the call I asked if she could follow up through email so I could have this on record.

I was in 4th grade, new to the school district, and at the time undiagnosed for a number of things. She would focus in and cut me down in class, mock me for my passion for reading and spelling, and question the validity of my requests and needs. As the year went on, I spent more and more time going to the nurse\u2019s office for a break during the day, and on multiple occasions, I came back to hear her making fun of me to the other students. She even encouraged and laughed at bullying from my classmates. \n\nI never told my mom because my teacher had made me feel like I was the problem. It greatly damaged my relationship with education and my ability to trust in adults/others. I\u2019m decades away from it now but still find myself thinking about it regularly.\n\nI\u2019m happy you caught this & are getting your kid help, and I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re not willing to quietly sit back and risk it happening to others.", "You need to get a lawyer involved.  Your child was verbally abused to the point of needing therapy.  Right now, the teacher is getting away with it.  Even if she loses her job will this record go onto the next school, or will it be she was looking for a school with a better fit?  When does the verbal turn physical.", "oh, I agree on that. I just meant it would be a more complex situation in terms of what the right next step would be and whether jumping straight to emailing the other parents would have been it. I could see an agrument being made that escalating to the superintendent or school board would have been better, in that hypothetical.\n\nas it is, I think you're all good.", "I literally just laughed way too hard at \u201cshe was not amused\u201d. Of course not, she knew she was wrong and would hate for anyone to be aware of how she treats parents that would dare threaten her or the schools image.", "You should consider follow up in email and ask for confirmation of this policy she stated during the call and that their standard for abusive teachers is silence"]}
