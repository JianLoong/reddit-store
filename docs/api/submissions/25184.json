The handler must maintain control of the animal at all times \u201d (source:  https://www.ada.gov/resources/service-animals-faqs/#:~:text=The%20ADA%20requires%20that%20service,the%20individual%20with%20a%20disability. )\n\nYour friend should know this if she has a service animal. Are you sure this is a service animal and not an emotional support animal. Is the animal needed due to a disability? What task is it trained to perform?", "NTA, Easy solution, dog goes in a cage if it doesn\u2019t go with her, if she doesn\u2019t like that, tough shit", "ESH\n\nA real service dog is not going to lose its isht for being left a few hours. They are non reactive or anxious by definition. \n\nThat said, they are not supposed to be left in situations where pets aren't allowed. \n\nBut of course they are not needed in all situations. \n\nI think you're all trying really hard to be difficult and not work on solutions. \n\nThe reservation could be transferred to her and her card used. You could find dog sitting services if it's going to be a long outing. And she could decide to bring the dog or sit out some events. \n\nAnyhow. You're fair to not want to be on the hook but you also have to fully acknowledge this is a very improbable situation you're making a big deal of. Assuming it's a legitimate service animal.", "The person didn't say she needed the dog with her at all times for disability reasons. That was OP, saying the person needed to keep watch on her dog at all times.", "Service dogs cover SUCH a wide variety of needs, and many don't require them to be glued to the handler's side 24/7. Often they are able to give the handler a ton of independence to do things on their own rather than needing a person/caregiver to accompany them, for example. I.e. if they have a medical episode when they are alone, the dog can go and find someone to help. Or if they are feeling faint, the dog will lead them to a chair. So being with a group of people can mitigate this and allow them time away from their service dog. \n\nTo simply say that no one with a service dog should be able to go anywhere without one or else it's a fake service dog would be a huuuuge generalization. Like people who think that someone in a wheelchair is literally unable to walk. It's a wide, wide spectrum.", "Cancel the VRBO booking and have the person who has the dog make the booking.\n\nNacho dog.\nNacho booking.\nNacho problem.", "NTA - but make them use their credit card instead of you.", "There has been a significant uptick in the theft of dogs, including service dogs, from VRBOs in our city.  One service dog was stolen when the renter went to the office to grab a coffee.  It\u2019s been tragic to see the news stories.  Almost none are recovered.  Not only is the VRBO property not safe from damage but *the dogs* are not safe being left alone\u2026theft, fire, choking, etc.", "We have an Airbnb and we would allow pets if it was specifically agreed upon ahead of time, but it\u2019s within our rights to terminate the entire reservation if someone misrepresented their party or violates the terms, etc. etv", "Dogs typically don\u2019t pee in crates once they\u2019re trained. Of course there\u2019s a time limit.", "I really want to know what disability needs a service dog but you can get by without one for bar hopping and jet skiing. \n\nMost suggestions for leaving the dog at home have been she can use a cane if she's blind. But she can't be blind or deaf if she's going jet skiing, right?  Does she only have epilepsy when sober and on solid ground?", "My wife has a service dog, and is in a band. She leaves the dog home when she does practices and shows. And we often do things like go to the lake and let doggo be off duty. Off duty as a service dog at least, the dog has decided he has a second job herding my kids lol.", "If it were a legit service dog she wouldn't be able to leave it anywhere because she NEEDS it. That's what service dogs are. Maybe it's an emotional support animal, but there are no protections in place for them and you will get charged if you make the mistake of putting your card on this.", "NHL player, Max Domi, has a diabetic alert service dog. He's talked in interviews about how he leaves Orion at home on game days, it's his time to sleep and basically relax because when Max is there, Orion is working.", "Yeah there are reasons why you may not bring a service dog to the bar but may bring it on vacation in general. Guide dogs are one reason (if going with friends) though I\u2019m assuming OP would know if the person were blind. But there many reasons service dogs are needed and it varies more than people are acting like.", "LOL OP didn't say when this trip is or where they're located.  It's possible that the weather would be fine and, of course, I'm assuming the dog owner would have the good sense to know the difference.  FYI I've actually called the police on 2 dogs left in cars in the past five weeks.", "Thank you for being an excellent dog parent!", "LOL they're talking about using jet skis, pretty sure that's hot/warm weather activity but you do you, keep calling cops on dogs trapped in cars but ignore this one just for a few hours should be just fiiine! /s"]}
