The dog is only permitted because they are meant to be providing a service to a handler with a disability. If a dog is not with the handler, they are not a service dog, they are just a dog. \n\nFor the record, a service dog is a dog that has been trained to perform a task to assist a person with a disability. That\u2019s it. It does not have to be a life or death task, it doesn\u2019t mean that the person with a disability is completely unable to function without the presence of the service dog.

No, she cannot let the dog free roam while unattended. If she wants to crate it, I\u2019d allow that.

Even for a service dog.\n\nAnd you'd be on the hook for any damages.", "NTA In the US, a service dog has been trained to perform a particular service task and is only a service dog when it is with the person with the disability. It's the person and the disability that legally requires the landlord to allow the dog, not any particular way the dog has been trained. If it's a true service dog then it's likely to be very well behaved but you're right to be concerned because if you leave it alone, it legally reverts to \"pet\". This can all be resolved by someone else doing the reservation.", "NTA\n\nSomething weird here. So she doesn't need her service dog during exhausting and potentially stressful situations, with loud noises, tons of unfamiliar people and drinking?

You said it's a service dog that can't be denied, I feel like the owner is going to be upset about that and find a reason to hit back. I mean it's their home they've opened it up to pet free rentals and someone with a service dog chooses to rent it anyways, I don't forsee that going over well at all tbh.", "NTA. You are responsible for damages, the rental isn't pet friendly, and service dogs are not to be left alone in rentals, as per the ADA. You are not being ableist. You are protecting your own interests from someone trying to put you at risk of liability.", "Nta", "Can\u2019t the person with the dog just put it on their card?\n\nNTA - no reason it should be you taking all the risk as far as I can see.", "Have you told the others that are pestering you, that you will cancel the rental and allow them to put it on their card?", "NTA. The charges are going on your card and you would be taking a risk.", "NTA. That's not a service dog, it's an emotional support animal. If the pet is being accommodated at the VRBO but wouldn't at a bar? It's not a service animal. For example, I've never heard of a seeing-eye dog or a medical alert dog being excluded from any bar or restaurant.\n\nThe rule with service dogs is that you take them everywhere when you get accommodations that aren't pet friendly for obvious reasons, i.e., you actually *need* the animal to assist you with regular tasks or for medical reasons. My wife managed apartment complexes and hotels for years, people with legitimate service animals do not leave them in their room. It's also part of the ADA.\n\nIf the person with the non-service dog wants to cover incidentals with their credit card, then they can leave the dog wherever they please. Until that time, you're within your rights to not want anything to do with leaving a dog unsupervised in a VRBO that isn't pet friendly. Heck, I think you would be within your rights to veto taking the dog entirely. It's not a service dog.", "NTA but do propose to those, that call you names to transfer the reservation to their card. If they are ready to shoulder any additional fees, let them. I assure you, all of them will shut up as sson as you propose this.

That **is ableist**.\n\nETA\nA SD can handle ordinary loud music, like a drag show.  A fife and drum muster in an auditorium, maybe not.

There\u2019s no rule that service dogs must be with their handlers at all times. They can legally be home alone\u2026.this does not violate the pet policy.
