It\u2019s possible (and likely) that someone could have a service dog that is trained to do a task that they *could* do themselves or with the support of someone else if need be, but having the service dog takes that strain off of their day-to-day life. For example, someone with mobility issues could have a service dog that\u2019s trained to open doors for them, pick up things they\u2019ve dropped, fetch things like their wallet or keys for them, etc. - it doesn\u2019t mean the handler is physically incapable of doing those things by themselves, but it may be difficult or cause them pain so having the dog alleviates that and just makes their life much easier.\n\nI\u2019m also not sure how true this is but I\u2019ve heard some guide dog schools require people to be able to navigate well with a cane before they\u2019re able to get a guide dog. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there are similar requirements for other types of service dogs to ensure that people have some baseline level of being able to manage their condition (for lack of a better description) since dogs are living creatures that will not always be able to be there with the handler, not just because some settings aren\u2019t safe for dogs but also because they could get sick or injured and not be able to work during that time.", "\u201cQ29.

While I usually opt for pet friendly places when traveling occasionally I have to stay someplace that isn't and that means I either plan the trip to make sure my dog can accompany everywhere based on activities and weather, or I find a daycare if there's an activity I don't feel comfortable bringing him to. \n\nHonestly all the people saying a service dog should be able to handle the noise of a bar have clearly never met someone with a service dog.
