Lately, we have noticed Isabella\u2019s lack of contribution to the apartment in regards to cleaning the common area & bathroom, lack of doing chores, and lack of purchasing shared items. Typically when one of us goes home and brings us necessities such as toilet paper or paper towels, she usually expects one of the other roommates to notice and take care of it.

For two weeks my bathroom went without toilet paper and later ran out of soap as well. During week one of being out of toilet paper, Isabella revealed to one of our roommates that she had only been using the bidet since they had run out. \n\nAfter telling her that we ran out of soap and toilet paper, I confronted her about how I\u2019ve been contributing to 90% of the bathroom supplies and it\u2019s about time for her to buy some toilet paper and soap.

After that, I completely stopped cleaning the shower, scrubbing the toilet, taking out the trash, refilling toilet paper, and refilling soap. The bathroom looks atrocious but at this point, I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019m the one that\u2019s been doing everything this past year and feel like I\u2019ve been taken advantage of.

Don't get too emotionally invested - this will only be for a short time in your life and some folks just won't learn.

Life's too short!", "Before you decided to \u201ctest\u201d her, did you try talking to her?", "NTA, but this is not a sustainable strategy.
