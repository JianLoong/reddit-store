I would have just told him I am not coming since he treated you like crap and apologize to his fianc\u00e9 for the late cancellation (if you care about a relationship with her).  Your family also sucks to enable such comments.", "YTA. Why lie? You should have just been up front about it. It's not like you're worried about preserving the relationship. Put a stop to this once and for all and go NC", "NTA.  You didn't say you agreed to perform any function at the wedding (MOH, usher, whatever.)  So I'll assume you were just a guest.  In that case, you are not obligated to attend. \n\nIt probably would have been more polite/proper to have given him more warning that wouldn't attend, since you probably RSVP'd yes and they use those numbers to plan seating, food, etc.  But if you're ill the day of the wedding, there's nothing you can do.  And okay, you faked the illness, but they can't know that.\n\nI have a narcissistic/emotionally abusive brother.  And I never understand why people like that insist that people they don't get along with attend their events.  Isn't it easier for everyone that you didn't go?", "Can't really fault you,  but it might have been better to be honest about it and just said your were done with him and his bullying instead of making up excuses and pretending.", "I understand why you didn't go. Honestly you should've confronted your brother on his toxic personality. \n\nI'd go no contact with him. \n\n1/5  A points", "OP, you did the right thing cutting him out. He has not apologized to you, and looks unlikely that he will. You should told him that you will not be attending when he made that underhanded remark, and stood by the decision. Do not let him push you around.", "NTA.  You didn\u2019t have to go to the wedding if you didn\u2019t want to and you gave them the perfect excuse to explain to anyone that asked why you weren\u2019t there.", "INFO: why you just didn't confront your brother about his behaviour towards you and tell him you'll not attend? It'd be at least honest.", "NTA.  Op could've told the truth, but what are the chances her family would side with her?  They would've told her to suck it up to keep the peace, & that's not ok.  Sometimes telling the truth will make the situation worse.", "You should have, not should of.  You should have rsvp'd no in the first place.", "YTA. You lied to family to get out of doing something that was important and that made you uncomfortable because you didn\u2019t want to address the truth and issues beforehand. You could have told the truth and have had every opportunity to speak your mind about the issues but made the conscious decision to stay quiet. It sound like your brothers behavior and comments were in fact rude and unkind, we all have our breaking point but it\u2019s really weird to stay quiet after all the back handed comments, pull the sick card and lie. Especially on such an important day not just for your brother but for your mom, dad, and new sister in law you claim to really like. It was a bit selfish.", "NTA. Im normally a big believer in honesty but I also think they have to deserve honesty in order to get it. If they\u2019re going to be accuse you of jealousy, yell and abuse you or try to emotionally manipulate you then they dint deserve your honesty. And you get to say whatever makes things easier for you.", "NTA. You should be honest with them though. I would go low or no contact with them all: your half brother for being a complete ass and your parents for letting it happen.", "NTA\n\nBut no reason to lie. Just be honest with your feelings on why you don't want to go. Write it down in a letter so you can be sure everything you want to explain is there, and you can't be interrupted.\n\nGet your own place, if you're still living with parents, and go No Contact (or Low contact if you still want contact with your other family members) with your brother, and forget about him.", "Y N T A for lying about why you didn\u2019t want to go. I can understand that it probably would\u2019ve caused a large issue if you confronted your brother\u2019s behavior right before his wedding day. You realized you didn\u2019t want to go and made that happen in the least disruptive way possible. NTA.", "YTA. It\u2019s his wedding. Somehow I don\u2019t believe all your claims in here and I\u2019d need his side of the story. Or there\u2019s more here than you\u2019re telling. \n\nI don\u2019t think his comment about the dress was enough to seal this for you. \n\nI\u2019m also getting the vibe from your post that you\u2019re the type of person that thinks everything is an attack on you.", "NTA, but you should tell him, his wife, and his parents exactly why you weren't. Mostly so his wife knows what kind of person he is. Was it the best thing to lie about why you didn't go? No, but you can explain that you felt hurt by his repeated actions and this was the tipping point and you were uncomfortable giving your reasons at that time,", "Nta. If they keep bothering you about it, ask them if they would have preferred you throwing up in the during the ceremony.", "NTA. No contact is the best contact", "NTA for not wanting to go, but YTA for how you got out of it. \n\nAnyone could have smelt the BS excuse a mile away and the end result seems to have still been NC with your brother. \n\nMight as well of just been brutally honest about your brother sickening behavior", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\"ll stay home.\" But, I do understand why you didn't. Sometimes it's hard to call people out, Especially when there is a long history of them belittling you.  And I don't blame you for skipping the wedding", "He and your family don't deserve to be allowed to pretend everything is okay.\n\nNTA", "NTA. But it sounds like you have been bullied a lot by him so direct confrontation is rough for you. He is an AH. Please talk to your therapist or a good friend about standing up for yourself better. And it\u2019s ok if you decide to tell family the truth about your brother, even SIL if she asks.\n\nI\u2019m also concerned that your brother said \u201cyou look nice for a change \u201c with no one in your family calling him out. The fact that they let that go is a big red flag that you should not listen to them. They don\u2019t have your back.", "NTA\n\nGood for you for not going. \n\nAlso, I suspect you being sick was the only way out considering your parents didn't show you any empathy even though they thought you were sick. They sure as heck wouldn't have had your back if you said you didn't want to go cause he is a shitty brother. Let me guess, you are supposed to suck it up and be the bigger person?\n\nFreaking hate parents who don't hold sh#tty kids accountable.\n\nGo you! Stay NC. Be kind to yourself.", "NTA. Idk why people are acting like it\u2019s so easy to just say why you didn\u2019t want to go. You have chronic health issues! It sounds like you\u2019re still living with your family!!! Idk if you rely on them heavily or not, but regardless, they sound like they enable your brother\u2019s shitty behavior. If you were honest, it sounds like you\u2019d be crucified imo.\n\nSometimes you have to be strategic in how you handle these things. I don\u2019t blame you OP.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would you want to be at that person's wedding anyway?", "You did good. Your family should at least pretend to understand. Now you know how little they care. You might even find your mental health improves if you can resist their bullying."]}
