For the entirety of our friendship, we\u2019ve had sleepovers and when we have sleepovers, we\u2019ve ALWAYS slept in the same bed. That\u2019s simply a staple of our sleepovers, it\u2019s not a sleepover if we don\u2019t. We\u2019re both night owls and even once we\u2019re done with our activities for the night and lay down for sleep, we\u2019ll talk in the dark until we pass out. \n\nNow here\u2019s a speedbump I\u2019ve never thought of: my boyfriend just moved in with me fairly recently and my best friend and I have arranged a sleepover. I casually say to my boyfriend: \u201cHey, (best friend) is coming over, so would you be alright if we took the bed and you sleep in the living room?\u201d \n\nWhen I tell you, this man was absolutely AGHAST. He says, \u201cOrrrrr (best friend) can sleep in the living room and we sleep in OUR bed?\u201d\n\nThe fact that he wasn\u2019t cool with wanting to sleep in the living room didn\u2019t really shock me, so I say, \u201cOkay, then (best friend) and I will just sleep in the living room and you can have the bed.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t like that either! He is deadset on the idea that we sleep together and guests sleep seperately. But she\u2019s my BEST FRIEND, this has been the routine for YEARS and I don\u2019t really view it as that big of a deal. Even when I had a fight with my mother when I was 19 and asked if I could stay at her place, she let her boyfriend take their bed and she slept on the tiny ass couch in the living room with me. \n\nI would just feel bizarre being like, \u201cOkay, goodnight!\u201d and leaving her in the living room. I can\u2019t describe it, it\u2019s just weird.\n\nThoughts?

Like what? Maybe if she wasn\u2019t willing to compromise on sleeping in the living room but wtf people. It\u2019s ONE NIGHT, it\u2019s totally unhealthy for the bf to react this way over not getting to sleep with his gf for again ONE NIGHT. That\u2019s a major red flag. I\u2019m 35 and still have \u201csleepovers\u201d with my friends occasionally and it\u2019s definitely not weird for us to sleep in the same space, and some of my friends are married. Why can\u2019t the bf spend, and lets say this again, ONE NIGHT, not sleeping next to his gf?\n\nEFJ: you\u2019re definitely NTA, OP.", "NTA - You would have been the AH if you insisted he sleep on the couch so you and your friend get the bed. But he cannot insist YOU sleep in the bed just because you have a guest over. He can express his dislike for the idea, but him being \"dead set against it\" makes it seem like he is not willing to let it go.", "NTA - arguably, you shouldn\u2019t have asked for your BF to sleep on the couch, it\u2019s his bed too.\nHowever, if you offered to sleep in the living room, why should he care?\nIf this is going to be an issue in the future, maybe you should have future sleepovers at your friends place", "NTA- You continuing to hold this tradition with your best friend sounds so wonderful and healing to your inner-child. I wish I was still this close to some of my childhood friends and I hope you two can continue your friendship for more decades to come. It is so strange that your boyfriend is denying you something that sounds to be incredibly innocent? \nHim being upset by the idea of sleeping on the couch makes sense but him also being upset by the two of you setting up camp in the living room makes no sense. Did he give you an actual explanation for his feelings on this or is he just being controlling for no reason other than perhaps jealousy?", "NTA.  If you\u2019d gotten upset over him not wanting to sleep on the couch, I\u2019d have said you\u2019re at fault, but since you\u2019re willing to sleep out in the living room with your friend and let him stay in his own bed, you\u2019re not.", "NTA.\nI assume that you and your boyfriend are sleeping together most of the time? I don't think you're being unreasonable about this at all. The sleepovers don't happen very often anymore and they're a special thing. Even if he doesn't understand that talking in bed for hours is half the fun, it's a little weird that he's reacting this way IMO. I guess boys don't do sleepovers really, so it might be beneficial to explain it in more detail to him?\n\nedit: but I think you guys taking the couch is the better option here, I'd be pissed if I was uninvited from my own bed for this lol", "NTA i think it's completely okay for you and friend to sleep on the sofa and him in the bed.", "NTA - This is weird. He\u2019s treating this as a houseguest situation when it\u2019s a *sleepover.* You don\u2019t just leave someone you invited for a sleepover in the other room and do your normal bedtime routine. It\u2019s like a little overnight party/chill girl\u2019s night. You\u2019re not kicking him out of the house, just asking for some space to hang out with your friend.", "NTA. You're allowed to sleep wherever you want. You asked your bf if he would mind sleeping in the living room, he refused, which is his right, but he can't make you sleep in his bed.", "NTA. This is important and special, and your bf should not only understand but support your friendship. Having a close relationship like that is rare, and it should be honored. It's fine if he doesn't want to give up the bed, but he can't dictate where you sleep.", "I understand why he didn\u2019t want to give up the bed, but not why he was still upset when you mentioned he could have the bed and you and your friend will be on the couch. This is usually the arrangement with me and my friend and her boyfriend. Her and i will sleep on the couch while he sleeps on the bed in their bedroom", "NTA me (f) and my friends do this all the time, when we travel we get one bed to save money. All the guys I have talked to do find it weird tho. Most say the couldn\u2019t imagine sharing a bed with their other guy friends. I think maybe men are conditioned to not have that level of platonic intimacy. Maybe bf sees it as a sexual thing? This needs more conversation to find out what actually makes him mad or uncomfortable about it?", "NTA, it's important to maintain old friendships (and cultivate new ones) as you enter adulthood. People always complain about how they don't have friends as an adult or don't get to spend enough time with their friends, this is why. Because people don't prioritise friendships over other things. This is your tradition, and you should keep it up as long as you can. BF can cope for one night, especially if he gets the bed and you two take the couch.", "I'm going with NAH because your boyfriend certainly doesn't have to like it, or even understand it, and he isn't putting his foot down and forbidding you from doing it -- he's just not liking it. (Or is he? I hope not!)\n\nAs a fellow night owl, who loves to talk well into the wee hours with old friends whenever I stay at their homes, I completely understand where you're coming from here. You would have been the A if you insisted that your boyfriend give up his bed, but you didn't -- and I think sleeping in the living room with your friend is a perfectly reasonable compromise. \n\nMaybe he would understand if you stressed to him that it's not about \\*sleeping,\\* but \\*talking?\\* And if you stay up late talking, then you surely don't want to bother him by doing it in the same room where he's trying to sleep.", "So no, you're NTA.\n\nLet's start there.\n\nBUT. It really depends on your upbringing which side of this arrangement feels weird.\n\nI never once shared a bed with a friend growing up.  My parents had guests, they stayed in spare rooms or public rooms (living room, basement).  It wasn't until I was an adult that I even heard of someone giving up their bed for a guest.  Likewise for a couple sleeping separately, even for a night.\n\nYou're NTA because it's your tradition and it's nice and it's harmless.  It's not necessarily \"weird\" that your BF might be thrown for a loop over this.  It may be way outside of his personal experiences.\n\nI would say it's unreasonable to ask that he vacate the bed, but not unreasonable to stay in the living room with your friend.  This is just part of your bonding with your friend and it's an important tradition.  Just gotta talk through your feelings and what it means to each of you.", "NAH\n\nYes, every sleep over that you have had with your friend has had you both sleeping in the same bed together.\n\nBut I also assume that since you moved in with your boyfriend, every night that you've gone to bed the two of you have slept together too.\n\nI can see where you don't think that it's a big deal, but I can also see why your boyfriend thinks it is a big deal. Also, why is it weirder to leave your friend in the living room than to leave your boyfriend alone in the bed?", "NTA - I would have also been offended at the suggestion that I sleep on the couch, but you girls sleeping on the couch together sounds cute and fun", "NTA You'd be the AH if you were insisting he slept in the living room. But you aren't, you said you'd sleep in the living room with your friend and he doesn't like that either. I think it's super sweet that you have a tradition with your friend! Don't let bf ruin it.", "I mean leading with: please let me kick you out of your bed wasn't probably helping I making him receptive to you guys sleeping on the couch and him in the bed. \n\n\nInfo: Why can't you talk and once you realise u are dead tired go to bed?", "NTA How long have you been with BF? I get him not wanting to give his night of sleep to the couch, but if you all do, I don\u2019t see why this is a big deal. It sounds as if the fun part for you all is talking until you pass out.", "Flipped, I guess this would weird me out too. So I sympathise with the BF. Also understand the tradition, and have done similar things, years ago.\n\nNAH will have to suffice.", "NAH. I understand wanting to have the same type of sleepover as you\u2019ve had before, but I also understand how the bf would be upset about the first request to sleep on the couch. That was very presumptuous of OP to think she could kick him out of their room. The suggestion of living room for the two friends is the perfect option and a good alternative. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting to see how not one reader has commented on the situation of two same sex friends having sleepovers when it\u2019s two girls but if it were two guys most scream \u201c omg, they must be gay\u201d.  I don\u2019t think the two are more than friends but really, people should respond this way for both guys and girls.\n\nThe bf not liking them sleeping together is understandable but saying she shouldn\u2019t be with her friend in living room is a bit much. Again, no asshole here, but sounds like OP and bf need to discus some things.", "NTA. Has he ever acted like this before?", "NTA for having a sleepover and sharing a bed, that's totally fine. I don't think it's fair to kick your bf out of his own bed for the night, but offering for you both to sleep in the living room together is fine. It's weird he's being weird about it.", "Honestly this ended differently than I was expecting, I get not wanting someone to be in your bed and be sent to the lounge, but what\u2019s his problem with you sleeping in the living room with bestie??  That\u2019s a pretty normal and appropriate thing imo, NTA but you need to have a serious talk with your bf about his insecurities, he seems either too hung up on spending every night with you (unlikely) or (more likely) insecure about how close you are with your friend. Worth talking about, especially if you\u2019re serious about this relationship working out, but idk man personally I\u2019d think he was being a bit silly by being so adamant that he can\u2019t spend one night alone or go find something to occupy himself while the two of you have a gals night. Living with someone doesn\u2019t mean they get dibs on you 24/7 \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. I understand him not wanting to sleep on the couch in his own home totally fair. But you offered a great alternative. Him insisting you sleep in your bed with him is a weird hill to die on. Ya'll are still young and it's totally fair to still have that fun sleepover mentality.", "NTA. You would have been if you insisted he sleep on the couch but you offered to sleep in the living room which makes so much sense. I see nothing wrong with that for one night", "NTA. I have no idea why he would object to you sleeping in the living room with your friend, especially if you explained the nature of your sleepovers to him, but he seems a bit threatened by the idea. I also think it would be pretty reasonable for him to let you two have the bed if it was an occasional thing. I\u2019d hold my ground on this, though. A good relationship should not interfere negatively with a healthy long-standing friendship.", "He\u2019s not wrong for not wanting to give up the bed he sleeps in for a night\u2026\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t want you to sleep in the living room for one night with your friend?! Sorry bro, you can\u2019t dictate where anyone else sleeps. Adults have slumber parties sometimes, albeit a lot less than kids. NTA", "NTA. \n\nIn my house, guests always get the best sleeping arrangements (they take one of our beds, and we sleep on the couch). \nHowever, I understand that not everyone has the same system, which is why your boyfriend not wanting to be moved out of his own bed is understandable. \n\nHim being against you sleeping with your friend is weird though. Did he provide any explanation as to why he\u2019s dead set on you sleeping in your bedroom?", "NTA your boyfriend is being a baby. Like what is his problem?", "NTA. But your boyfriend is. You've been friends with her as long as he's been alive, pretty much. He moved into *your* place, and really it's *your* bed. It sounds to me like he is threatened by this friendship, because he doesn't even want you both to go out to the living room to have your sleepover. You're right, it's your tradition and it would be weird that after decades of doing things this way, suddenly you just say goodnight and leave her alone. That takes away from half the fun of a sleepover anyway. The fun bit is being like \n\n\"Hey, you asleep?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n*Insert silly question, philosophical thought, etc. here.*\n\nDo your sleepover your way. He doesn't get to lord over you and how you do things, that's not what dating is about. Dating is understanding, respect, and setting reasonable boundaries. It's not a sexual thing, it's a long standing tradition, and he is not understanding of, nor respecting that. You set a reasonable boundary to move it to the living room. He isn't respecting that either.", "NTA. My best friend is coming to stay with us an extra day before and after my bachelorette. My fianc\u00e9 immediately offered to take the couch or go sleep at his parents house those nights so that her and I could share the bed. He knows our sleepover nights were important growing up and they\u2019re way too few and far between now that we live far apart.", "NTA. \n\nSleepover with your best friend. You sleep with BF every night now, he can sleep on his own once.", "NTA.  But why is he so worked up about you and your bestie sleeping together during your sleepover?  \n\nI'm getting creepy undertones about his reasoning.  Does he think there is more going on than just popcorn, movies and reminiscing?\n\nMaybe it's just me.", "NTA, plus the boyfriend is a fool, missing out on a chance to starfish.", "NTA. I\u2019ve had my friend sleep over our place several times and each time I sleep with her. My bf sleeps on our bed. My friend and I will sleep in the guest bedroom.", "Nta. It's not a sleepover if you are staying seperately. Your bf sounds insecure", "NTA - whenever my girlfriend has a friend over to spend the night my ass is on the couch with all my snacks watching anime. It\u2019s like a little vacation lol. Your bf needs to chill", "NTA this is weird. I still have sleepovers with all my best friends and no way would I be banishing them to the living room just bc my partner got funny about it", "I'm married with two kids, when my best friend sleeps over we always sleep in the same space, whether it's the bed or couch ect.\nShe's married now and the same thing applies to her place. \n\nNta, once you offered to stay in the livingroom and he still complained he became the ah. Don't let him controle things like this, it's weird.", "NtA. I think the Boyfriend is not exposed to the female concept of BFF's and of \"little girl antics.\" OP & BFF have been doing the same routine for years. It isn't sexual, in fact it's the farthest thing from it. They're not \"sleeping together\" they're renewing a bond that is revatilized by years of comfort, joy, and happiness. It's a routine that adult hood naturally \"crowds out\" A renewing of the deeper friendship that adult life steps on and naturally pushes away.\n\nMaybe OP should make him watch some movie clips of rom coms and all the sleep over scenes. \n\nIt's natural. Girls have different communication channels. Guy sleep overs always ended crashed in different parts of the living room well separated.\n\n Personally I think he needs to keep his ass on the couch for the night. Let OP have her personal space. It can only help his relationship.", "I\u2019m older (60) and I\u2019d say BF is acting more \u201cadult.\u201d Sleepovers like the OP is describing normally end when one moves in with a partner.\n\nBut also - so what? We all need some fun in our lives and it won\u2019t kill him to sleep alone in the bed while the \u201csleepover party\u201d goes on in the living room.\n\nI\u2019d say go ahead and have fun.", "ESH. You don't just get to turf him out of his own bed. I'm not surprised he was so taken aback.\n\nThat being said you offered an alternative with you and your mate sleeping in the living room. That should be sufficient. I fail to see what's bothered him about that suggestion.", "NAH I think neither of you are wrong, but I find your position to be the odd one, personally.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s just your thing.... makes sense to me. However, there will be a point (maybe now) that y\u2019all are going to need a \u201cnew thing\u201d. So come up with a new fun way to do sleepovers... maybe text each other from separate rooms or get yourselves a hotel when you go out for the night. \n\nOnce you hit a certain age people expect you to behave like grown ups who share a home with other people (so weird lol). You definitely can\u2019t kick your bf out of bed & he may be annoyed if you & bestie are laughing it up in the living room until 2 am.\n\nI (53f) & my bff (55f) have been friends since grade school. We sometimes act like we\u2019re 10 still. It\u2019s neither fun nor amusing for other people lol. We always shared a bed too... then we had to grow up :(\n\neta \u2014 I find it truly bizarre that no ones lives have ever changed & they are doing the same things with their friends that they did when they were 10 or 18. Our idea of fun as teenagers is no where near our idea of fun now.", "I don't think you're necessarily being a ah? but I do find it odd.", "[removed]", "NAH, but I think your tradition here is going to look odd to most people.\n\nWhen adults sleep in the same bed, it's generally assumed to be romantic. There are exceptions, and having a tradition of sleepovers for your whole life is one of them that makes some sense... but only some, and the first impression of \"hey, I'm going to kick you out of the bed to sleep with some girl\" is not going to be great.\n\nI get that there's not much point of a sleepover if you aren't all hanging out and sleeping in the same location, which is why sleepovers usually stop well before 22 years old, but I don't think you're going to have a ton of luck convincing your boyfriend it's OK for you to sleep next to somebody else, especially because you opened with kicking him out to sleep in the same bed and not, like, \"hey I'm going to sleep on the couch and she'll bring a sleeping bag\"; you sort of salted the Earth with that suggestion.", "NTA. This would be the perfect opportunity for BF to say \"Enjoy your sleepover! I'll call my buddies, we'll stay out late, and when I sneak in, I'll crash on the couch.\"", "How about you all sleep together? Seems like a reasonable way to keep everyone happy.", "ESH\n\n1. You can't kick your boyfriend out of the bed lmao, grow up.\n2. Your boyfriend shouldn't be reacting like this to you sleeping with your friend in the living room.\n\nWere tensions high during the argument? Maybe revisit it and try to talk it through again?", "I am over 40, and when a girlfriend stays over, my SO always offers to take the couch so 1) guest will be more comfy 2) So we can have more time to catch up. Your BF attitude is a red flag!", "NTA \n\nIf this is happening once or twice a year, BF should get over.   If it is happening every other week, I'd understand.\n\nI'm assuming there's no kink here.  If there is, that changes everything (maybe for better or worse).", "NAH.\n\nIf you had left it at, \"you need to sleep on the couch so I can sleep with my best friend\" you'd be the AH.  But bringing up you sleeping on the couch changes things.\n\nOne thing to think about though is this: \"I always sleep with my best friend when we do sleep overs.\" vs. \"We always sleep in the same bed.\"  Just to view it from your boyfriends perspective a little bit.", "ESH. I'm not surprised he was aghast at the suggestion of him sleeping on the couch however, you offered a more appropriate solution. I can't fathom why he takes issue with that one. It really doesn't affect him in the slightest.", "ESH\n\nHonestly it's all kind of weird. \n\nIt's your choice but it is an odd one to insist on sharing the bed as an adult. \n\nHe's not wrong for not wanting to be kicked out of his bed in his home. (If he moved in, he has no other home - he's not a guest. Your best friend is.)", "This is a hard one but I say ESH\n\nIt\u2019s really not okay to kick your bf out of his own bed, but then he turned it around by dictating where YOU sleep as well\u2026.I thought your alternative was fine.", "NTA you asked, he said no, you accepted that and now he\u2019s being unreasonable", "This is a tough situation. While I understand your boyfriend wants to sleep in the same bed as you, I also understand the sentiment behind sleeping in the same bed as your best friend. The one thing that throws me off though is your boyfriend's insistence on you sleeping in the same bed as him.....but also your insistence on sleeping in the same bed/couch with your best friend. \n\nAlso, I am curious to know if your boyfriend knew how close you are with your best friend, and if you even asked/mentioned wanting to have the sleepover before the plans were even set in stone. If you guys are living together now, it usually is a common courtesy to mention things like that and discuss your partner's feelings about someone coming over for set days. It seems like you sprung the sleepover and you both sharing the bed together all at once without a second thought about him.\n\nNow when I have sleepovers with friends, we usually sleep in the living room and do not share a couch, especially a tiny one at that. Do you think your boyfriend could be uncomfortable with that idea and just does not know how to express it? \n\nI vote NTA since it really isn't a big deal for one night you don't share a bed with your boyfriend. I just think communication could've been better on both ends.", "NAH - I honestly can see both sides of this and they are both valid.\n\nYes, it would not hurt to spend one night not sharing a bed. It is a best friend tradition and, I'm assuming, it's purely platonic so you BF shouldn't have anything to worry about.\n\nHis point of view, wanting to sleep with his GF, in their bed, like they do every night. It might just sound weird to him because its something he has never experienced before.\n\nEasy compromise, all three of you share the bed ;)", "NTA. Me and my best friend do the same thing if we\u2019re at her house, mine is a different story because my bedroom is overrun by a whole bunch of stuffed animals. But, I don\u2019t think her boyfriends ever taken issue with it, and the fact that he has an issue with you sleeping not in a bed with him is weird.", "INFO Did your boyfriend move in because you were both ready, or due to circumstances.", "All of these people saying \u2018NTA\u2019, what if the best friend was someone of the opposite sex? Exactly the same metric. Best friends since kindergarten. Always platonic. Just pals. Would that be ok? \n\nMaybe you\u2019re at the point where you\u2019ve moved onto the next phase of your life and sleepovers aren\u2019t the same as they used to be. Perhaps the BF thought he was in a relationship with an adult, not someone who still clings to childhood behaviours.", "Lol what. \n\nMy sister was already married for like 6 years and we still had sleep overs where she shared the bed with me. It only changed once we were both married and our baby was born. \n\nYour bf is being silly. Especially since you were willing to do a living room bed situation. (Really good idea btw. Make a big bed and fall asleep watching movies) \n\nNTA.", "NTA. No matter your relationship status you can sleep wherever you want. Sleepover or no.", "NTA. Your bestfriend sounds important person to you, and you\u2019re absolutely right to give her attention during sleepovers, which I assume happens once in a while. Your bf is acting weird about it. It sounds like controlling behaviour from his end.", "YTA simply for the reason that if this situation were gender flipped, you would be getting eviscerated as a guy. SO yea, YTA. That boy needs to RUN!", "I don't think he gets it, honestly. My SO has her friends over to stay and if she wanted to kick me out of our bed or go sleep with her friend I would have been a bit taken aback cause I personally would have thought it was a bit strange at our age. \n\nLike to you it may be normal and tradition. To him he probably thinks it's strange and possibly even sexual with the way you were quickly willing to toss him on the couch, then quickly switching up to go sleep with her.\n\nYou probably made it more awkward, verses explaining that you wanna have the night with your friend to spend some time like you always have traditionally as friends during sleepovers to recapture those moments.\n\nIt's probably a confusing concept to someone that hasn't experienced it. So I would say your NTA but definitely put yourself in an awkward bind.", "NTA. It\u2019s one night and he doesn\u2019t even have to give up sleeping in his bed. This is him being controlling.", "NTA - it\u2019s not an asshole situation, you just need to find the middle ground with your man. \nIs he paying rent? Or just living with you?\n\nOut of fairness, especially if he is paying rent, I think you & your best friend should sleep in the living room and he can keep the bedroom. If it\u2019s one night every now and then sleepover type thing, he shouldn\u2019t mind.. if it\u2019s a regular thing.. OK I get it if he minds\u2026 \n\nIf he wants you to sleep with him in bed for sexual reasons\u2026 you can find the time and place to sleep with him before and after the sleep over so he doesn\u2019t miss out on anything\u2026 so he feels reassured and gets what he needs\u2026 \n\nIf he is insisting for you to sleep in bed instead of the living room with best friend for reasons other than good night or good morning sex, then that is a bit weird especially if it\u2019s just a 1 night sleep over thing.

For the entirety of our friendship, we\u2019ve had sleepovers and when we have sleepovers, we\u2019ve ALWAYS slept in the same bed. That\u2019s simply a staple of our sleepovers, it\u2019s not a sleepover if we don\u2019t. We\u2019re both night owls and even once we\u2019re done with our activities for the night and lay down for sleep, we\u2019ll talk in the dark until we pass out. \n\nNow here\u2019s a speedbump I\u2019ve never thought of: my boyfriend just moved in with me fairly recently and my best friend and I have arranged a sleepover. I casually say to my boyfriend: \u201cHey, (best friend) is coming over, so would you be alright if we took the bed and you sleep in the living room?\u201d \n\nWhen I tell you, this man was absolutely AGHAST. He says, \u201cOrrrrr (best friend) can sleep in the living room and we sleep in OUR bed?\u201d\n\nThe fact that he wasn\u2019t cool with wanting to sleep in the living room didn\u2019t really shock me, so I say, \u201cOkay, then (best friend) and I will just sleep in the living room and you can have the bed.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t like that either! He is deadset on the idea that we sleep together and guests sleep seperately. But she\u2019s my BEST FRIEND, this has been the routine for YEARS and I don\u2019t really view it as that big of a deal. Even when I had a fight with my mother when I was 19 and asked if I could stay at her place, she let her boyfriend take their bed and she slept on the tiny ass couch in the living room with me. \n\nI would just feel bizarre being like, \u201cOkay, goodnight!\u201d and leaving her in the living room. I can\u2019t describe it, it\u2019s just weird.\n\nThoughts? AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s just her sleeping in another room for one night. It doesn\u2019t really make a difference for him bc he can have the bed she said. Also this is talking to him beforehand.

She realized she made a mistake there and immediately offered a solution.", "It is though. HE doesn\u2019t have to have grown up like that.

I never slept in the same bed as friends at sleepovers -- we sacked on in sleeping bags in the family room.  I also stopped having sleepovers when I was about 16/17 and cannot imagine ever having had a 'sleepover' as an adult.   Like yeah, if a friend and I were hanging out and drank too much and she needed to crash on my couch?  Sure.  But actually planning to have another adult come spend the night in my bed in a non-sexual way?  That would definitely strike me as weird.    \n\n\nI don't think it makes OP an asshole.

I would have started with moving to the living room first then think about my partner moving somewhere else.", "I dunno, maybe he is demanding? \u2026 OP needs to explain the reason why he doesn\u2019t want her sleeping with BFF in living room\u2026", "It's sad honestly. I think a lot of it is a weird byproduct of the way social media has changed dating and relationships. Lots of people now see someone staying over as an inherently sexual thing to do, and have an even harder time fathoming being able to sleep next to someone who isn't a sexual partner. That's genuinely sad to me. We are getting to a point where every form of touch and intimacy is automatically filed under sexual and that just isn't true. This is probably why so many people are touch starved, because they think they can't hold a platonic friend's hand, or take a nap on the same couch or bed with no sex.

Projecting much?", "I realized they weren\u2019t married and changed it to BF.", "I edited it to BF. Why can\u2019t he stay separate from her for one night? I don\u2019t know. Ask him.

Leave the best friend out of the equation, say she just wanted alone time on the couch, would he have a problem then? It is borderline red-flag territory, but I guess this is just a small snippet of their life.", "It's one night and they \"just\" moved on together. If he can't be alone for one night, he's codependent as hell and that's not healthy. Boyfriend clearly has attachment issues and it's not OP's fault. He needs to work that shit out.

Instead she could've said, \"Hey I was thinking of having my best friend come on this date.\" I'd be upset if my partner just made plans to have their friend come over without talking to me about it first. Especially for a sleepover. I don't think it's a big deal that she doesn't share a bed with him, but personally, I like more of a heads up when people are coming.

He's a grown ass person who has slept by himself a lot.", "Do I wasn't the only one who found that really weird?!", "Why is stating a preference immediately \"your insecurity\"? Judgemental much?

What if they were a platonic friend of the opposite sex, for example?\n\nYou can call it insecurity. There are a lot of judgmental people like you out there who prefer to throw around accusations instead of understand each other. But the reality is that there\u2019s a whole range of people out there with different boundaries for what kind of relationship they want, and what kind of exclusivity with their intimacy. Being kicked out of your bed so your spouse can sleep with someone else is definitely a red flag for some, maybe not others. That doesn\u2019t make anyone an asshole, just potentially incompatible.", "I get your reasoning, but I think preferences about boundaries are not necessarily rooted in a fear that something sexual might happen (although they often are). There are other boundaries in addition to \"don't have sex with anyone but me\".\n\nFor instance, there are limits to how close some people are comfortable that their partner is with their mother. Not because it's sexual, but because it feels too enmeshed - inappropriate because if a different *too close*.\n\nSimilarly, a partner being so close to their friend that they enjoy cuddling in the same bed at night may feel uncomfortable to some - crossing healthy boundaries that are normal in friendships. I imagine many would disagree, but that doesn't mean that people who feel this way are insecure.", "The whole sleepover thing as an adult is weird as fuck.

However if they wanted to sleep together sure, I personally don't have an issue with it. However, some could still find this a bit strange and may find it awkward not knowing the context behind it.

You won\u2019t catch me sleeping on the couch or the floor with my bff. Actually she also prefers the comfort of our guests rooms & her own private bathroom. We can enjoy each other\u2019s company & then go to bed. Like every other day of our lives.", "It's totally weird to me. I can't wrap my head around why two grown friends would want to sleep in the same bed unless they absolutely had to.", "Why is it a big deal for her to sleep next to her boyfriend every single night?", "I don't think you're understanding my issue. \n\nI don't care if they want to share a bed, but why do they *need* to? Why is it so important that OP would disregard the comfort of their own bed to sleep in the living room with their friend? That's what's weird to me.", "Just because you think it\u2019s weird doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s actually weird lol.", "i didnt", "She did discuss. She brought up the visit and started a dialogue about sleeping arrangements before her friend ever arrived. \n\nWhat else do you think she reasonably owed him? Some of y'all just sound needy.", "Sometimes heat of the moment things happen. You two are chatting and then oh we can do that together oh oh OH!! why don\u2019t we have a sleep over???", "It's not like they have one room in the house. OP is ready to make compromise. They're gonna move out of whichever room he want to claim.  \nPlans not involving her wouldn't cause any problem. But dude refused to sleep alone \ud83d\ude44 His plan does involve her.", "I don\u2019t think either of those things matter to be honest. His gf wants a night with her friend. It doesn\u2019t matter where that takes place, she\u2019s allowed to have healthy friendships, which this is, and nurture those friendships anyway she sees fit as long as it isn\u2019t unhealthy. And this isn\u2019t unhealthy", "His girlfriend is choosing to sleep with someone else over him this ONE time she\u2019s having a sleepover with her best friend. If she sleeps with him 362 days in a year and 3 with her, whom does she rather sleep with?", "I think the main issue was that OP expected her bf would have no issue being kicked out of his own bed for this. Like I said I think the approach of OP is the main problem here.\n\nI'd happily share a bed with my best friend. But I wouldn't tell my fiance we were planning on kicking him to the couch to do it, and I also wouldn't talk about it like it was an impossibility that we'd ever stop. Your keyword here is \"sometimes\" too.", "Cool good for you.", "Right? I adore my BFF and we've shoehorned all kinds of sleeping arrangements in over the 30+ years we've been friends, but I think it's awesome that she now has a guest room where I can have my own bed and space. Sadly, at my place she's still stuck on the couch;  I only have a 1BR and the dog gets the spot next to me.", "Intimacy isn't a zero-sum game though. Treating it as such can quickly end up in codependent territory. Which really isn't emotionally healthy.", "It\u2019s not a big deal at all. That\u2019s why he should chill out about her sleeping away from him for one night.", "But WHY? You keep telling me friends don\u2019t need to share a sleeping space and say it\u2019s weird but you haven\u2019t given a good reason why. \n\nMaybe because she wants to stay up late with her friend and doesn\u2019t want to wake the bf up getting into bed after he\u2019s already asleep. Or maybe she just wants the comfort that friend gives for that night. There are plenty of scenarios", "Ok. I believe you.\n\nBack in school I used to tell my friends \"Let's go to my house\". Now I feel bad because it implies that my parents had no ownership of the house. I better apologize to them.", "That is true. That happens. Doesn't make it any less inconsiderate. Shit happens though. I think they both need to work on communication better", "What is your argument exactly? Ensuring your plans will work is better than having to retroactively cancel.", "Right, which is why I think she's not an asshole. Which I have said in multiple comments, and made a \"judgment\" comment saying NTA. But I understand why he might be abrasive to the situation. However, if he is always like this, then that's a problem", "It matters because your claim is predicated on the notion he can't stand to spend a single night apart from her. If he has no problem with her sharing a bed with her friend elsewhere then your claim would clearly have no merit. It really sounds to me like them sharing a bed isn't the problem, her choosing to share a bed with the friend over him is the problem.\n\n>she\u2019s allowed to have healthy friendships, which this is, and nurture those friendships anyway she sees fit as long as it isn\u2019t unhealthy. And this isn\u2019t unhealthy\n\nYou may think it's healthy to choose to sleep with your friend over your partner but many people would not share that opinion. I personally don't think it's unhealthy but my perspective is simply my own. I don't get to decide what constitutes healthy behaviour and what doesn't.", ">If she sleeps with him 362 days in a year and 3 with her, whom does she rather sleep with?\n\nIf she chooses her every time in situations where she actually has to choose between them then it sounds like she'd rather sleep with her. There is no choice between the two to be made those other 362 days a year.", "And I agree with that, but at the same time I don't think there are many people that don't have some things they consider romantic that they'd rather their partner not do with other people, especially when it's specifically replacing them. If your partner was visiting in / participating in a culture where kissing as greetings is the norm. If they continuously took their friend on romantic candlelit dinners. Holding hands and cuddling all the time, when you're there. Gave them a dozen roses. Spending a majority of your free time with that person. Romantic actions are made-up / cultural, but I think an average relationship has expectations that you don't do certain actions with other people.  \n\n\n And I'd say sleeping together as adults is a common romantic action, in at least my culture. I don't know how many stories I've read/watched with some equivalent of \"I want to wake up next to you for the rest of my life,\" or \"I want you to be the last thing I see when I close my eyes.\"  \n\n\nAnd you can get into the semantics of \"I don't want/like you doing that\" vs \"You can't do that\" vs \"I don't want to be in a relationship with those boundaries\" but I just don't think anyone here is introspective enough / thinking in that level of detail atm.", "It feels juvenile to me. That's my opinion. I think it's strange because OP already has a perfectly good place to sleep, that place is easily accessible, and there is no good reason not to use it. As I said, the need to sleep in the living room with your friend gives me huge slumber party vibes, and I don't want to be in a relationship with someone who's gonna have slumber parties in their 20s. Crashing at a friend's place is fine. Needing to stay the night somewhere is normal. But needing to sleep next to the person staying over gives me major immaturity vibes.", "i believe that is a different case but i will not argue with you over this. have a pleasant day", "My argument is that sometimes things are the spur of the moment and not planned.", "I still don't see how he could be abrasive about this, apart from him being an unreasonable AH? \nIt's not an obligation to sleep together everynight with your spouse. If he have plans involving her (\"sleep together\") that somehow he must do at all cost, then it's on him to discuss it with her. Else she's free to do as she wishes.  \nI can understand if he doesn't want a stranger spending the night at their house without prior notice. But his problem is not even with the place, it's with how she spent her time. If she wants to sleep alone or even go out that night with her friend, she shouldn't have to ask for his permission.", "Imo she's allowed to choose to not share a bed with him whether the friend is there or not. People might want to sleep apart for various reasons.", "In general, healthy and unhealthy behaviors are inherently objective. Such as alcoholism, smoking, codependency.", "She could have made the choice to move in with her best friend, yet she chose to move in with him and sleep with him.", "She chose him for those 362 days when she decided to move in with him.", "Sounds like you just want her to be boring and miserable. This reminds me of the lady who got mad at me at the playground for playing of the equipment with my kids, instead of just sitting on the benches with the other moms. I wore all the kids out that day!! She should have been thanking me, not yelling at and judging me.", "Then I guess don\u2019t be with someone like that? Im in my mid 30s, my friends are all in our mid 30s and we were just planning to have a \u201cslumber party\u201d at my house where we have wine, apps, and do face masks and stuff. It\u2019s really not weird. 2 of my friends are married, the other lives with her bf, and I have a bf(though we don\u2019t live together yet). We all have kids as well. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nOh, I have a 4 bedroom house, and we\u2019d probably sleep in pairs in 2 of the beds. So", "Yeah and that is not always the right way to operate when other people are affected.", "Again, your statement is predicted on the notion he upset they will be spending the night apart. It's my opinion that that isn't the issue. The issue is her choosing to sleep with her friend *instead* of him.", "Oh please on this sub everyone's an addict or a codependent and abusive partner. What's objective is a diagnosis from a professional that meets the guidelines formulated by experts. What's very much not objective are the opinions of armchair psychiatrists on this sub who have labelled people alcoholics for simply wanting alcohol at their wedding. Objectively speaking, people who have zero business handing out diagnoses for supposed addicts and codependent partners do it all the time based on very little information. Objectivity practically doesn't even exist in the AITA universe.", "Doesn't sound like she's choosing her boyfriend if the only time she has to actually choose between them she chooses her friend.", "If my friend made a point to share the living room with me if I was staying over, I'd find it very weird. Especially if they had a bed. \n\nShe can do whatever she wants. I'm still gonna think it's unusual."]}
