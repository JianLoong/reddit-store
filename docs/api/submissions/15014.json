For the entirety of our friendship, we\u2019ve had sleepovers and when we have sleepovers, we\u2019ve ALWAYS slept in the same bed. That\u2019s simply a staple of our sleepovers, it\u2019s not a sleepover if we don\u2019t. We\u2019re both night owls and even once we\u2019re done with our activities for the night and lay down for sleep, we\u2019ll talk in the dark until we pass out. \n\nNow here\u2019s a speedbump I\u2019ve never thought of: my boyfriend just moved in with me fairly recently and my best friend and I have arranged a sleepover. I casually say to my boyfriend: \u201cHey, (best friend) is coming over, so would you be alright if we took the bed and you sleep in the living room?\u201d \n\nWhen I tell you, this man was absolutely AGHAST. He says, \u201cOrrrrr (best friend) can sleep in the living room and we sleep in OUR bed?\u201d\n\nThe fact that he wasn\u2019t cool with wanting to sleep in the living room didn\u2019t really shock me, so I say, \u201cOkay, then (best friend) and I will just sleep in the living room and you can have the bed.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t like that either! He is deadset on the idea that we sleep together and guests sleep seperately. But she\u2019s my BEST FRIEND, this has been the routine for YEARS and I don\u2019t really view it as that big of a deal. Even when I had a fight with my mother when I was 19 and asked if I could stay at her place, she let her boyfriend take their bed and she slept on the tiny ass couch in the living room with me. \n\nI would just feel bizarre being like, \u201cOkay, goodnight!\u201d and leaving her in the living room. I can\u2019t describe it, it\u2019s just weird.\n\nThoughts?

Like what? Maybe if she wasn\u2019t willing to compromise on sleeping in the living room but wtf people. It\u2019s ONE NIGHT, it\u2019s totally unhealthy for the bf to react this way over not getting to sleep with his gf for again ONE NIGHT. That\u2019s a major red flag. I\u2019m 35 and still have \u201csleepovers\u201d with my friends occasionally and it\u2019s definitely not weird for us to sleep in the same space, and some of my friends are married. Why can\u2019t the bf spend, and lets say this again, ONE NIGHT, not sleeping next to his gf?\n\nEFJ: you\u2019re definitely NTA, OP.", "NTA - You would have been the AH if you insisted he sleep on the couch so you and your friend get the bed. But he cannot insist YOU sleep in the bed just because you have a guest over. He can express his dislike for the idea, but him being \"dead set against it\" makes it seem like he is not willing to let it go.", "NTA - arguably, you shouldn\u2019t have asked for your BF to sleep on the couch, it\u2019s his bed too.\nHowever, if you offered to sleep in the living room, why should he care?\nIf this is going to be an issue in the future, maybe you should have future sleepovers at your friends place", "NTA- You continuing to hold this tradition with your best friend sounds so wonderful and healing to your inner-child. I wish I was still this close to some of my childhood friends and I hope you two can continue your friendship for more decades to come. It is so strange that your boyfriend is denying you something that sounds to be incredibly innocent? \nHim being upset by the idea of sleeping on the couch makes sense but him also being upset by the two of you setting up camp in the living room makes no sense. Did he give you an actual explanation for his feelings on this or is he just being controlling for no reason other than perhaps jealousy?", "NTA.  If you\u2019d gotten upset over him not wanting to sleep on the couch, I\u2019d have said you\u2019re at fault, but since you\u2019re willing to sleep out in the living room with your friend and let him stay in his own bed, you\u2019re not.", "NTA.\nI assume that you and your boyfriend are sleeping together most of the time? I don't think you're being unreasonable about this at all. The sleepovers don't happen very often anymore and they're a special thing. Even if he doesn't understand that talking in bed for hours is half the fun, it's a little weird that he's reacting this way IMO. I guess boys don't do sleepovers really, so it might be beneficial to explain it in more detail to him?\n\nedit: but I think you guys taking the couch is the better option here, I'd be pissed if I was uninvited from my own bed for this lol", "NTA i think it's completely okay for you and friend to sleep on the sofa and him in the bed.", "NTA - This is weird. He\u2019s treating this as a houseguest situation when it\u2019s a *sleepover.* You don\u2019t just leave someone you invited for a sleepover in the other room and do your normal bedtime routine. It\u2019s like a little overnight party/chill girl\u2019s night. You\u2019re not kicking him out of the house, just asking for some space to hang out with your friend.", "NTA. You're allowed to sleep wherever you want. You asked your bf if he would mind sleeping in the living room, he refused, which is his right, but he can't make you sleep in his bed.", "NTA. This is important and special, and your bf should not only understand but support your friendship. Having a close relationship like that is rare, and it should be honored. It's fine if he doesn't want to give up the bed, but he can't dictate where you sleep.", "I understand why he didn\u2019t want to give up the bed, but not why he was still upset when you mentioned he could have the bed and you and your friend will be on the couch. This is usually the arrangement with me and my friend and her boyfriend. Her and i will sleep on the couch while he sleeps on the bed in their bedroom", "NTA me (f) and my friends do this all the time, when we travel we get one bed to save money. All the guys I have talked to do find it weird tho. Most say the couldn\u2019t imagine sharing a bed with their other guy friends. I think maybe men are conditioned to not have that level of platonic intimacy. Maybe bf sees it as a sexual thing? This needs more conversation to find out what actually makes him mad or uncomfortable about it?", "NTA, it's important to maintain old friendships (and cultivate new ones) as you enter adulthood. People always complain about how they don't have friends as an adult or don't get to spend enough time with their friends, this is why. Because people don't prioritise friendships over other things. This is your tradition, and you should keep it up as long as you can. BF can cope for one night, especially if he gets the bed and you two take the couch.", "I'm going with NAH because your boyfriend certainly doesn't have to like it, or even understand it, and he isn't putting his foot down and forbidding you from doing it -- he's just not liking it. (Or is he? I hope not!)\n\nAs a fellow night owl, who loves to talk well into the wee hours with old friends whenever I stay at their homes, I completely understand where you're coming from here. You would have been the A if you insisted that your boyfriend give up his bed, but you didn't -- and I think sleeping in the living room with your friend is a perfectly reasonable compromise. \n\nMaybe he would understand if you stressed to him that it's not about \\*sleeping,\\* but \\*talking?\\* And if you stay up late talking, then you surely don't want to bother him by doing it in the same room where he's trying to sleep.", "So no, you're NTA.\n\nLet's start there.\n\nBUT. It really depends on your upbringing which side of this arrangement feels weird.\n\nI never once shared a bed with a friend growing up.  My parents had guests, they stayed in spare rooms or public rooms (living room, basement).  It wasn't until I was an adult that I even heard of someone giving up their bed for a guest.  Likewise for a couple sleeping separately, even for a night.\n\nYou're NTA because it's your tradition and it's nice and it's harmless.  It's not necessarily \"weird\" that your BF might be thrown for a loop over this.  It may be way outside of his personal experiences.\n\nI would say it's unreasonable to ask that he vacate the bed, but not unreasonable to stay in the living room with your friend.  This is just part of your bonding with your friend and it's an important tradition.  Just gotta talk through your feelings and what it means to each of you.", "NAH\n\nYes, every sleep over that you have had with your friend has had you both sleeping in the same bed together.\n\nBut I also assume that since you moved in with your boyfriend, every night that you've gone to bed the two of you have slept together too.\n\nI can see where you don't think that it's a big deal, but I can also see why your boyfriend thinks it is a big deal. Also, why is it weirder to leave your friend in the living room than to leave your boyfriend alone in the bed?", "NTA - I would have also been offended at the suggestion that I sleep on the couch, but you girls sleeping on the couch together sounds cute and fun", "NTA You'd be the AH if you were insisting he slept in the living room. But you aren't, you said you'd sleep in the living room with your friend and he doesn't like that either. I think it's super sweet that you have a tradition with your friend! Don't let bf ruin it.", "I mean leading with: please let me kick you out of your bed wasn't probably helping I making him receptive to you guys sleeping on the couch and him in the bed. \n\n\nInfo: Why can't you talk and once you realise u are dead tired go to bed?", "NTA How long have you been with BF? I get him not wanting to give his night of sleep to the couch, but if you all do, I don\u2019t see why this is a big deal. It sounds as if the fun part for you all is talking until you pass out.", "Flipped, I guess this would weird me out too. So I sympathise with the BF. Also understand the tradition, and have done similar things, years ago.\n\nNAH will have to suffice.", "NAH. I understand wanting to have the same type of sleepover as you\u2019ve had before, but I also understand how the bf would be upset about the first request to sleep on the couch. That was very presumptuous of OP to think she could kick him out of their room. The suggestion of living room for the two friends is the perfect option and a good alternative. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting to see how not one reader has commented on the situation of two same sex friends having sleepovers when it\u2019s two girls but if it were two guys most scream \u201c omg, they must be gay\u201d.  I don\u2019t think the two are more than friends but really, people should respond this way for both guys and girls.\n\nThe bf not liking them sleeping together is understandable but saying she shouldn\u2019t be with her friend in living room is a bit much. Again, no asshole here, but sounds like OP and bf need to discus some things.", "NTA. Has he ever acted like this before?", "NTA for having a sleepover and sharing a bed, that's totally fine. I don't think it's fair to kick your bf out of his own bed for the night, but offering for you both to sleep in the living room together is fine. It's weird he's being weird about it.", "Honestly this ended differently than I was expecting, I get not wanting someone to be in your bed and be sent to the lounge, but what\u2019s his problem with you sleeping in the living room with bestie??  That\u2019s a pretty normal and appropriate thing imo, NTA but you need to have a serious talk with your bf about his insecurities, he seems either too hung up on spending every night with you (unlikely) or (more likely) insecure about how close you are with your friend. Worth talking about, especially if you\u2019re serious about this relationship working out, but idk man personally I\u2019d think he was being a bit silly by being so adamant that he can\u2019t spend one night alone or go find something to occupy himself while the two of you have a gals night. Living with someone doesn\u2019t mean they get dibs on you 24/7 \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. I understand him not wanting to sleep on the couch in his own home totally fair. But you offered a great alternative. Him insisting you sleep in your bed with him is a weird hill to die on. Ya'll are still young and it's totally fair to still have that fun sleepover mentality.", "NTA. You would have been if you insisted he sleep on the couch but you offered to sleep in the living room which makes so much sense. I see nothing wrong with that for one night", "NTA. I have no idea why he would object to you sleeping in the living room with your friend, especially if you explained the nature of your sleepovers to him, but he seems a bit threatened by the idea. I also think it would be pretty reasonable for him to let you two have the bed if it was an occasional thing. I\u2019d hold my ground on this, though. A good relationship should not interfere negatively with a healthy long-standing friendship.", "He\u2019s not wrong for not wanting to give up the bed he sleeps in for a night\u2026\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t want you to sleep in the living room for one night with your friend?! Sorry bro, you can\u2019t dictate where anyone else sleeps. Adults have slumber parties sometimes, albeit a lot less than kids. NTA", "NTA. \n\nIn my house, guests always get the best sleeping arrangements (they take one of our beds, and we sleep on the couch). \nHowever, I understand that not everyone has the same system, which is why your boyfriend not wanting to be moved out of his own bed is understandable. \n\nHim being against you sleeping with your friend is weird though. Did he provide any explanation as to why he\u2019s dead set on you sleeping in your bedroom?", "NTA your boyfriend is being a baby. Like what is his problem?", "NTA. But your boyfriend is. You've been friends with her as long as he's been alive, pretty much. He moved into *your* place, and really it's *your* bed. It sounds to me like he is threatened by this friendship, because he doesn't even want you both to go out to the living room to have your sleepover. You're right, it's your tradition and it would be weird that after decades of doing things this way, suddenly you just say goodnight and leave her alone. That takes away from half the fun of a sleepover anyway. The fun bit is being like \n\n\"Hey, you asleep?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n*Insert silly question, philosophical thought, etc. here.*\n\nDo your sleepover your way. He doesn't get to lord over you and how you do things, that's not what dating is about. Dating is understanding, respect, and setting reasonable boundaries. It's not a sexual thing, it's a long standing tradition, and he is not understanding of, nor respecting that. You set a reasonable boundary to move it to the living room. He isn't respecting that either.", "NTA. My best friend is coming to stay with us an extra day before and after my bachelorette. My fianc\u00e9 immediately offered to take the couch or go sleep at his parents house those nights so that her and I could share the bed. He knows our sleepover nights were important growing up and they\u2019re way too few and far between now that we live far apart.", "NTA. \n\nSleepover with your best friend. You sleep with BF every night now, he can sleep on his own once.", "NTA.  But why is he so worked up about you and your bestie sleeping together during your sleepover?  \n\nI'm getting creepy undertones about his reasoning.  Does he think there is more going on than just popcorn, movies and reminiscing?\n\nMaybe it's just me.", "NTA, plus the boyfriend is a fool, missing out on a chance to starfish.", "NTA. I\u2019ve had my friend sleep over our place several times and each time I sleep with her. My bf sleeps on our bed. My friend and I will sleep in the guest bedroom.", "Nta. It's not a sleepover if you are staying seperately. Your bf sounds insecure", "NTA - whenever my girlfriend has a friend over to spend the night my ass is on the couch with all my snacks watching anime. It\u2019s like a little vacation lol. Your bf needs to chill", "NTA this is weird. I still have sleepovers with all my best friends and no way would I be banishing them to the living room just bc my partner got funny about it", "I'm married with two kids, when my best friend sleeps over we always sleep in the same space, whether it's the bed or couch ect.\nShe's married now and the same thing applies to her place. \n\nNta, once you offered to stay in the livingroom and he still complained he became the ah. Don't let him controle things like this, it's weird.", "NtA. I think the Boyfriend is not exposed to the female concept of BFF's and of \"little girl antics.\" OP & BFF have been doing the same routine for years. It isn't sexual, in fact it's the farthest thing from it. They're not \"sleeping together\" they're renewing a bond that is revatilized by years of comfort, joy, and happiness. It's a routine that adult hood naturally \"crowds out\" A renewing of the deeper friendship that adult life steps on and naturally pushes away.\n\nMaybe OP should make him watch some movie clips of rom coms and all the sleep over scenes. \n\nIt's natural. Girls have different communication channels. Guy sleep overs always ended crashed in different parts of the living room well separated.\n\n Personally I think he needs to keep his ass on the couch for the night. Let OP have her personal space. It can only help his relationship.", "I\u2019m older (60) and I\u2019d say BF is acting more \u201cadult.\u201d Sleepovers like the OP is describing normally end when one moves in with a partner.\n\nBut also - so what? We all need some fun in our lives and it won\u2019t kill him to sleep alone in the bed while the \u201csleepover party\u201d goes on in the living room.\n\nI\u2019d say go ahead and have fun.", "ESH. You don't just get to turf him out of his own bed. I'm not surprised he was so taken aback.\n\nThat being said you offered an alternative with you and your mate sleeping in the living room. That should be sufficient. I fail to see what's bothered him about that suggestion.", "NAH I think neither of you are wrong, but I find your position to be the odd one, personally.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s just your thing.... makes sense to me. However, there will be a point (maybe now) that y\u2019all are going to need a \u201cnew thing\u201d. So come up with a new fun way to do sleepovers... maybe text each other from separate rooms or get yourselves a hotel when you go out for the night. \n\nOnce you hit a certain age people expect you to behave like grown ups who share a home with other people (so weird lol). You definitely can\u2019t kick your bf out of bed & he may be annoyed if you & bestie are laughing it up in the living room until 2 am.\n\nI (53f) & my bff (55f) have been friends since grade school. We sometimes act like we\u2019re 10 still. It\u2019s neither fun nor amusing for other people lol. We always shared a bed too... then we had to grow up :(\n\neta \u2014 I find it truly bizarre that no ones lives have ever changed & they are doing the same things with their friends that they did when they were 10 or 18. Our idea of fun as teenagers is no where near our idea of fun now.", "I don't think you're necessarily being a ah? but I do find it odd.", "[removed]", "NAH, but I think your tradition here is going to look odd to most people.\n\nWhen adults sleep in the same bed, it's generally assumed to be romantic. There are exceptions, and having a tradition of sleepovers for your whole life is one of them that makes some sense... but only some, and the first impression of \"hey, I'm going to kick you out of the bed to sleep with some girl\" is not going to be great.\n\nI get that there's not much point of a sleepover if you aren't all hanging out and sleeping in the same location, which is why sleepovers usually stop well before 22 years old, but I don't think you're going to have a ton of luck convincing your boyfriend it's OK for you to sleep next to somebody else, especially because you opened with kicking him out to sleep in the same bed and not, like, \"hey I'm going to sleep on the couch and she'll bring a sleeping bag\"; you sort of salted the Earth with that suggestion.", "NTA. This would be the perfect opportunity for BF to say \"Enjoy your sleepover! I'll call my buddies, we'll stay out late, and when I sneak in, I'll crash on the couch.\"", "How about you all sleep together? Seems like a reasonable way to keep everyone happy.", "ESH\n\n1. You can't kick your boyfriend out of the bed lmao, grow up.\n2. Your boyfriend shouldn't be reacting like this to you sleeping with your friend in the living room.\n\nWere tensions high during the argument? Maybe revisit it and try to talk it through again?", "I am over 40, and when a girlfriend stays over, my SO always offers to take the couch so 1) guest will be more comfy 2) So we can have more time to catch up. Your BF attitude is a red flag!", "NTA \n\nIf this is happening once or twice a year, BF should get over.   If it is happening every other week, I'd understand.\n\nI'm assuming there's no kink here.  If there is, that changes everything (maybe for better or worse).", "NAH.\n\nIf you had left it at, \"you need to sleep on the couch so I can sleep with my best friend\" you'd be the AH.  But bringing up you sleeping on the couch changes things.\n\nOne thing to think about though is this: \"I always sleep with my best friend when we do sleep overs.\" vs. \"We always sleep in the same bed.\"  Just to view it from your boyfriends perspective a little bit.", "ESH. I'm not surprised he was aghast at the suggestion of him sleeping on the couch however, you offered a more appropriate solution. I can't fathom why he takes issue with that one. It really doesn't affect him in the slightest.", "ESH\n\nHonestly it's all kind of weird. \n\nIt's your choice but it is an odd one to insist on sharing the bed as an adult. \n\nHe's not wrong for not wanting to be kicked out of his bed in his home. (If he moved in, he has no other home - he's not a guest. Your best friend is.)", "This is a hard one but I say ESH\n\nIt\u2019s really not okay to kick your bf out of his own bed, but then he turned it around by dictating where YOU sleep as well\u2026.I thought your alternative was fine.", "NTA you asked, he said no, you accepted that and now he\u2019s being unreasonable", "This is a tough situation. While I understand your boyfriend wants to sleep in the same bed as you, I also understand the sentiment behind sleeping in the same bed as your best friend. The one thing that throws me off though is your boyfriend's insistence on you sleeping in the same bed as him.....but also your insistence on sleeping in the same bed/couch with your best friend. \n\nAlso, I am curious to know if your boyfriend knew how close you are with your best friend, and if you even asked/mentioned wanting to have the sleepover before the plans were even set in stone. If you guys are living together now, it usually is a common courtesy to mention things like that and discuss your partner's feelings about someone coming over for set days. It seems like you sprung the sleepover and you both sharing the bed together all at once without a second thought about him.\n\nNow when I have sleepovers with friends, we usually sleep in the living room and do not share a couch, especially a tiny one at that. Do you think your boyfriend could be uncomfortable with that idea and just does not know how to express it? \n\nI vote NTA since it really isn't a big deal for one night you don't share a bed with your boyfriend. I just think communication could've been better on both ends.", "NAH - I honestly can see both sides of this and they are both valid.\n\nYes, it would not hurt to spend one night not sharing a bed. It is a best friend tradition and, I'm assuming, it's purely platonic so you BF shouldn't have anything to worry about.\n\nHis point of view, wanting to sleep with his GF, in their bed, like they do every night. It might just sound weird to him because its something he has never experienced before.\n\nEasy compromise, all three of you share the bed ;)", "NTA. Me and my best friend do the same thing if we\u2019re at her house, mine is a different story because my bedroom is overrun by a whole bunch of stuffed animals. But, I don\u2019t think her boyfriends ever taken issue with it, and the fact that he has an issue with you sleeping not in a bed with him is weird.", "INFO Did your boyfriend move in because you were both ready, or due to circumstances.", "All of these people saying \u2018NTA\u2019, what if the best friend was someone of the opposite sex? Exactly the same metric. Best friends since kindergarten. Always platonic. Just pals. Would that be ok? \n\nMaybe you\u2019re at the point where you\u2019ve moved onto the next phase of your life and sleepovers aren\u2019t the same as they used to be. Perhaps the BF thought he was in a relationship with an adult, not someone who still clings to childhood behaviours.", "Lol what. \n\nMy sister was already married for like 6 years and we still had sleep overs where she shared the bed with me. It only changed once we were both married and our baby was born. \n\nYour bf is being silly. Especially since you were willing to do a living room bed situation. (Really good idea btw. Make a big bed and fall asleep watching movies) \n\nNTA.", "NTA. No matter your relationship status you can sleep wherever you want. Sleepover or no.", "NTA. Your bestfriend sounds important person to you, and you\u2019re absolutely right to give her attention during sleepovers, which I assume happens once in a while. Your bf is acting weird about it. It sounds like controlling behaviour from his end.", "YTA simply for the reason that if this situation were gender flipped, you would be getting eviscerated as a guy. SO yea, YTA. That boy needs to RUN!", "I don't think he gets it, honestly. My SO has her friends over to stay and if she wanted to kick me out of our bed or go sleep with her friend I would have been a bit taken aback cause I personally would have thought it was a bit strange at our age. \n\nLike to you it may be normal and tradition. To him he probably thinks it's strange and possibly even sexual with the way you were quickly willing to toss him on the couch, then quickly switching up to go sleep with her.\n\nYou probably made it more awkward, verses explaining that you wanna have the night with your friend to spend some time like you always have traditionally as friends during sleepovers to recapture those moments.\n\nIt's probably a confusing concept to someone that hasn't experienced it. So I would say your NTA but definitely put yourself in an awkward bind.", "NTA. It\u2019s one night and he doesn\u2019t even have to give up sleeping in his bed. This is him being controlling.", "NTA - it\u2019s not an asshole situation, you just need to find the middle ground with your man. \nIs he paying rent? Or just living with you?\n\nOut of fairness, especially if he is paying rent, I think you & your best friend should sleep in the living room and he can keep the bedroom. If it\u2019s one night every now and then sleepover type thing, he shouldn\u2019t mind.. if it\u2019s a regular thing.. OK I get it if he minds\u2026 \n\nIf he wants you to sleep with him in bed for sexual reasons\u2026 you can find the time and place to sleep with him before and after the sleep over so he doesn\u2019t miss out on anything\u2026 so he feels reassured and gets what he needs\u2026 \n\nIf he is insisting for you to sleep in bed instead of the living room with best friend for reasons other than good night or good morning sex, then that is a bit weird especially if it\u2019s just a 1 night sleep over thing.

For the entirety of our friendship, we\u2019ve had sleepovers and when we have sleepovers, we\u2019ve ALWAYS slept in the same bed. That\u2019s simply a staple of our sleepovers, it\u2019s not a sleepover if we don\u2019t. We\u2019re both night owls and even once we\u2019re done with our activities for the night and lay down for sleep, we\u2019ll talk in the dark until we pass out. \n\nNow here\u2019s a speedbump I\u2019ve never thought of: my boyfriend just moved in with me fairly recently and my best friend and I have arranged a sleepover. I casually say to my boyfriend: \u201cHey, (best friend) is coming over, so would you be alright if we took the bed and you sleep in the living room?\u201d \n\nWhen I tell you, this man was absolutely AGHAST. He says, \u201cOrrrrr (best friend) can sleep in the living room and we sleep in OUR bed?\u201d\n\nThe fact that he wasn\u2019t cool with wanting to sleep in the living room didn\u2019t really shock me, so I say, \u201cOkay, then (best friend) and I will just sleep in the living room and you can have the bed.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t like that either! He is deadset on the idea that we sleep together and guests sleep seperately. But she\u2019s my BEST FRIEND, this has been the routine for YEARS and I don\u2019t really view it as that big of a deal. Even when I had a fight with my mother when I was 19 and asked if I could stay at her place, she let her boyfriend take their bed and she slept on the tiny ass couch in the living room with me. \n\nI would just feel bizarre being like, \u201cOkay, goodnight!\u201d and leaving her in the living room. I can\u2019t describe it, it\u2019s just weird.\n\nThoughts? AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It does sound like she *told* him, not like she asked and discussed to make sure he was ok with it. But that\u2019s not why people can see the bf\u2019s side.

It\u2019s just her sleeping in another room for one night. It doesn\u2019t really make a difference for him bc he can have the bed she said. Also this is talking to him beforehand.

She realized she made a mistake there and immediately offered a solution.", "It is though. HE doesn\u2019t have to have grown up like that. But him being \u201cdead set\u201d on them sleeping together is weird. He doesn\u2019t get to dictate OP\u2019s life because of how he was raised lol", "Agreed.  I never slept in the same bed as friends at sleepovers -- we sacked on in sleeping bags in the family room.  I also stopped having sleepovers when I was about 16/17 and cannot imagine ever having had a 'sleepover' as an adult.   Like yeah, if a friend and I were hanging out and drank too much and she needed to crash on my couch?  Sure.  But actually planning to have another adult come spend the night in my bed in a non-sexual way?  That would definitely strike me as weird.    \n\n\nI don't think it makes OP an asshole.

I would have started with moving to the living room first then think about my partner moving somewhere else.", "I dunno, maybe he is demanding? \u2026 OP needs to explain the reason why he doesn\u2019t want her sleeping with BFF in living room\u2026", "It's sad honestly. I think a lot of it is a weird byproduct of the way social media has changed dating and relationships. Lots of people now see someone staying over as an inherently sexual thing to do, and have an even harder time fathoming being able to sleep next to someone who isn't a sexual partner. That's genuinely sad to me. We are getting to a point where every form of touch and intimacy is automatically filed under sexual and that just isn't true. This is probably why so many people are touch starved, because they think they can't hold a platonic friend's hand, or take a nap on the same couch or bed with no sex.

Projecting much?", "I realized they weren\u2019t married and changed it to BF.", "I edited it to BF. Why can\u2019t he stay separate from her for one night? I don\u2019t know. Ask him.

Leave the best friend out of the equation, say she just wanted alone time on the couch, would he have a problem then? It is borderline red-flag territory, but I guess this is just a small snippet of their life.", "It's one night and they \"just\" moved on together. If he can't be alone for one night, he's codependent as hell and that's not healthy. Boyfriend clearly has attachment issues and it's not OP's fault. He needs to work that shit out.

Instead she could've said, \"Hey I was thinking of having my best friend come on this date.\" I'd be upset if my partner just made plans to have their friend come over without talking to me about it first. Especially for a sleepover. I don't think it's a big deal that she doesn't share a bed with him, but personally, I like more of a heads up when people are coming.

She is my oldest child's biological grandmother. Not my husbands mother. And yes he slept alone in a different room. He survived and didn't have any issues with it. It was literally two nights.

He's a grown ass person who has slept by himself a lot.", "So I wasn't the only one who found that really weird?!", "Why is stating a preference immediately \"your insecurity\"? Judgemental much?

But this person isn\u2019t a relative, so that\u2019s kind of irrelevant. There are a lot of hypotheticals out there. What if they were a platonic friend of the opposite sex, for example?\n\nYou can call it insecurity. There are a lot of judgmental people like you out there who prefer to throw around accusations instead of understand each other. But the reality is that there\u2019s a whole range of people out there with different boundaries for what kind of relationship they want, and what kind of exclusivity with their intimacy. Being kicked out of your bed so your spouse can sleep with someone else is definitely a red flag for some, maybe not others. That doesn\u2019t make anyone an asshole, just potentially incompatible.", "I get your reasoning, but I think preferences about boundaries are not necessarily rooted in a fear that something sexual might happen (although they often are). There are other boundaries in addition to \"don't have sex with anyone but me\".\n\nFor instance, there are limits to how close some people are comfortable that their partner is with their mother. Not because it's sexual, but because it feels too enmeshed - inappropriate because if a different *too close*.\n\nSimilarly, a partner being so close to their friend that they enjoy cuddling in the same bed at night may feel uncomfortable to some - crossing healthy boundaries that are normal in friendships. I imagine many would disagree, but that doesn't mean that people who feel this way are insecure.", "The whole sleepover thing as an adult is weird as fuck.

However if they wanted to sleep together sure, I personally don't have an issue with it. However, some could still find this a bit strange and may find it awkward not knowing the context behind it.

It's a certain type of lonely to sit alone, hearing other people in the next room having fun. It's different than if he was sleeping alone because you were away. Like, did none of you ever sit awake in your room as a kid, having trouble sleeping, because your parents/siblings were having some kind of party/get-together that went past your bedtime, and all you could do was lay there and listen and think \"man they sound like they're having fun.\" \n\nNothing about his response suggests he's jealous of your relationship with your friend, or has some weird porn fantasy idea about what a sleepover is, everyone suggesting that has some shit to work out ffs.

You\u2019re nice for even letting him stay in the house\u2026 When I have sleepovers with my best friends, I tell my boyfriend way in advance so he can arrange to stay at his own best friends house! \ud83d\ude02 Girls night for us actually means girls night, no men allowed!", "bestie >>>>>>> BF. always. NTA.", "My wife is best friends with her sister and based on your situation it seems like the same sisterly relationship.  I always willingly take the couch when she stays over which is usually at LEAST once a month if not several more times.  Literally not an issue, NTA", "NTA has he never had a sleepover before???", "My best friend is a gay man. Whenever i stay with him, I stay in his bed or he stays in mine. Hell I\u2019ve even stayed in bed with him and his boyfriend more than once!!! It\u2019s just how our relationship is. My ex never had a problem in the 8 years we were together. It\u2019s mad that your BF is twisted over this! NTA", "NTA. I'm 30F and still share beds/rooms/sofas with my close female friends (who are also in relationships). My partner doesn't bat an eyelid. He's happy to have the bed to himself for a night & stay up late watching movies lol. I can understand your bf not wanting to give up his place in his bed, but to be upset about you & your friend sleeping on the sofa together is crazy. And even creepier if he's sexualising your friendship. Sleeping together can be totally platonic.", "NTA, he can survive one night without you. \nI do the same with my friends.", "NTA\n\nThis is totally a girls thing. I mean, hell, I am a grown ass (50F) woman and my BFF (we have been BFF's since we were 4 years old, I am NOT kidding) we sleep in the same bed! Don't think her husband hasn't picked on us, and hasn't tried the \"kink\" angle too! Like the \"Can we do a threesome\"?? In a joking way of course...to which we squealed and holled....NOOOOO...EWWW GROSS!!! LOL. But, yes....even in our 40's when \"sleep overs\" are years and years in between, when we get together we grab a bottle of cheap ass wine, chocolates, ragged-y ass t-shirts, shorts, and we stay up \"late\" (11 PM...lol) talking then we crash on a bed together. Face full of green goop from a facial. Only to wake up in the morning with raging headaches from cheap wine and dried on green good. LOL. \n\nTell your boyfriend to kick rocks that night.", "NTA\n\nYou've always done this and y'all would have the same sleeping arrangement if you just went over to her place. It's not like you're doing something extremely weird or sexually intimate with her, without his consent right? \n\nWhy is he against it? Did he give you a reason or explanation? He moved in with you, I assumed he'd at least know the nature/closeness of your relationship with your best friend.  \n\nSleeping together in the same room or bunking together is normal for sleepovers isn't it?\n\nMovies show girls piled together to sleep on the floor next to each other, or sharing beds chatting until they decide to pass out, because that's legit how it usually is, right?\n\nI did the same with my sister-like relationships--sharing beds with close friends, and chatting till we felt like passing out. \n\nThese aren't even like, old-as-time childhood friendships like you and your bestie. My family was very conservative before. I didn't get to really do sleepovers till I got to my teenage years/20s.\n\nThe only reasonable explanation I can possibly think of is if it has nothing to do with your friend. My husband is pretty attached to me. Maybe since he moved in so recently, he was excited about being able to sleep beside you every night?? But like. It's one night.\n\n**edit. \nJk. I asked my husband, he said it was weird that your boyfriend isn't okay with it.", "NTA \n\n\nMy husband of decades has slept on a pullout bed in a hotel suite for the night so my BFF and I could have the big bed with the door. He didn\u2019t want to be up all night, and then he also didn\u2019t want to bother anyone getting up earlier than us. \n\n\n\nThe idea that one night would be any kind of deal at all tells me that the boyfriend might not know OP well enough to have sleepovers yet. Either that, or he is a controlling buffoon and you need to proceed with caution.", "Sometimes I will sleep at my best friend's house (we are both in our 30s) and her husband will let us use their bed and he will sleep in the guest room, he'll even bring us wine and snacks so we can watch TV in bed together. We all think its fun/funny. \n\nEven if your boyfriend didn't want to give up the bed (reasonable), not wanting you to even sleep on the couch with her seems like he's insecure for a reason I can't quite wrap my head around. \n\nNTA.", "nta - this is a lifetime thing, she is your sister. Cuddle pile in the bed together(non-sexual - but this became my compromise with my husband, regardless of the friend's gender).", "NTA - platonic relationships are valid and important, and have boundaries and expectations of their own which should be navigated on their own terms based on the involved parties wishes and preferences. A romantic relationship does not overrule that, it coexists with that. Healthy romantic relationships encourage platonic connections and allow space for people to nurture and pursue friendships with other people. It's strange the boyfriend can't give space for OP's friend event for one night - although if he wants to sleep in his own bed that's more understandable and he gets to make that decision for himself.", "NTA\u2014I can understand where being asked to sleep on the couch may be off putting for him but you wanting to have an actual sleepover with your bestie and sleep in the living room with her shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Maybe have a talk with him and see why he\u2019s opposed to the idea?", "Does your bf think y'all are secret lovers? He's jealous of you having a friend who is that important to you. Don't do it. You're too young to start having a bf who bosses you around. Don't ask, mention it in passing like it's no big deal!\n\nStand up for yourself, in this situation, and throughout your whole life, too.", "I agree that it felt weird to me when I started having sleepovers in mine and my husband's own home. But he never saw a problem with it. I would usually stay in the lounge room with my friend until we'd both fallen asleep, and then I'd wake up in the middle of the night naturally and then go back to our bed. It wasn't something that we talked about in advance - I would just feel uncomfortable not in my own bed. By morning, I was up making breakfast as they woke up.", "NTA. I have two best friends who I regularly end up sleeping over at their places. Bsf #1 & I have been friends nearly 20 years as well and her husband does not hesitate to let us have the bed for the night. Bsf #2 and I will usually sleep in the living room but have also taken their bedroom a few times. To be incapable of sleeping apart for the few nights that you have sleepovers seems really codependent to me. You weren\u2019t wrong to ask if he\u2019d take the couch but you certainly weren\u2019t TA for letting him have the bed & you guys taking the living room.", "NTA- I can see why maybe he doesn\u2019t want to leave the bedroom. But it\u2019s not weird at all to share beds with friends as a sleepover, I still do it. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s annoyed with the compromise of you and your friend staying in the living room, he will not die just bc u sleep elsewhere for one night. He\u2019s gotta learn to be independent. Y\u2019all are both grown he can\u2019t dictate where you sleep so I say do what you want regardless. He\u2019s just gonna have to be okay with it", "BF is a weirdo or a control freak. Either way NTA", "Definitely NTA OP. I would say this could even be NAH depending on what was actually said. If you explained that y'all always do this for sleepovers going way back, then ya he's being an AH. If not then you can't blame him.  Based on what you wrote it sounds like he just wants to be with you, not necessarily that he doesn't want you to sleep with her instead imo. Just talk to him and if he's still against it that's a red flag for controlling.", "Nta, but he is\n\nI've had a friend since my first day of primary school, nearly 5 years old. We're now both turning 26 this year. She has a boyfriend, I have a fiancee. She sleeps in bed with me when she comes, we sit and talk and giggle until we pass out. My fiancee doesn't care \ud83d\ude02 tell him to grow up", "Salient point.", "But she's not booting him to the couch at all.\n\nAfter he shut that down, she was fine with that, and just said she'll sleep in the living room with her friend.\n\nAnd that should be totally fine.\n\nBut her bf doesn't like that, he doesn't seem able to spend just ONE night not in the same bed with her.", "My dad would sleep on the couch while my mum had sleepovers once or twice a year well into her 40s. People don't have to stop doing harmless things just because they've gotten older.", "Or worse, they don\u2019t have a romantic relationship at the moment but they only value romantic relationships. I can\u2019t tell you how many people I knew when I was younger who were like \u201cI\u2019m so lonely, I\u2019ll die alone, my life is meaningless because I don\u2019t have a romantic partner\u201d and like we, their friends, were right there? Listening to this? I understand the desire for romantic attachment in people who have that need but to just sit there and devalue your friends and family like that is just wild.", "So you just ignored the rest of the post?", "I am a 33 year old woman and I have had an extremely confused look on my face reading this entire thread, thinking I'm from another planet or something, because the idea of what you all are describing as a \"sleepover\" is not something I have ever remotely heard of.\n\nAnd yes, I think it's super weird. It doesn't make OP the AH but I do think it's incredibly weird, and if my husband were to say he wanted to have a friend over to have this kind of \"sleepover\", I would probably react the same as OPs boyfriend, because, to me, it's *really weird*.", "It's probably people like my sister and her husband saying that. When they were dating, they HAD to sleep in the same bed, even if it meant sleeping in a twin bed. They came over to stay with me once and all I had was a twin air mattress for them. I told my sister she could sleep in my bed with me (I needed to because I've had a back back since I was a teen) and her husband can sleep on the air mattress in the same room. Nope, she chose to share the air mattress with him. I don't get it, I'd never give up comfort like that just to be next to someone while I'm passed out asleep.", "My mouth hangs open and a choking snore rumbles from out of my throat.

My bestie of 30 years can sleep with me any damn time she wants and vice versa.\n\nNTA", "My sister needs to read this comment. She thinks she needs a relationship with a man because....well...I honestly have no idea. She thinks I am \"unhappy\" because I am NOT in a relationship. However, she is man hopping and each man treats her worse than the previous one did. When I was visiting her in February I had to kick the guy she was seeing then out. It was bad. Hell, she had \"two dates\" last night. She is extremely co-dependent. She couldn't put down the stupid dating app while she was visiting us this weekend.", "Oh god, I know right, it\u2019s truly something \ud83d\ude43", "Every other post on this sub is like \u201cYou disagree on what\u2019s appropriate??
