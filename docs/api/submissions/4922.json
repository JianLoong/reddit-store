Let the kids have similar sized rooms. \n\nIf there is no option for this then you could convert the master into a normal size room and have a closet and second bathroom with the extra space.

Each kids gets to have time in the big room. That's fair.\n\nSaying that Terrell should have it because he has friends coming over is a weird kind of favoritism, maybe based on sexism, maybe based on selfishness. But if you let it rule your house, your daughter will never forget it.", "NTA\n\nWhy not give it to Queenie until she has had a year of college and is reasonably starting to get settled into adulthood and no longer a full time resident of the house. By then Terrell will be the age Queenie is now and he can have the room until he has been attending college for a year. By that time the baby will want it although at that time you might feel better about being further away from the baby\u2019s room and take it for yourselves.", "NTA\n\nYou two need to work it out.

If it\u2019s a big issue you can always move Terrell into the big room after Queenie leaves for college. A teenage girl needs privacy far more than an elementary/middle school boy. She is also the only step-child so probably feels alienated sometimes and would appreciate her own space.  The basement or another space can be the hangout spot for Terrell and his friends if needed. There is literally no reason for a 9 year old boy to have a master bedroom with an en suite lol.", "Y'all take the master, get a baby monitor if the bedrooms are truly so far apart you can't hear the baby crying.

She is a teenage girl, she would ofcourse need a room with an attached washroom, unlike Terrell.", "ESH - you both have valid opinions on the matter. This is something that you should be able to discuss without getting mad at each other / starting a fight/ name calling. Best solution - you and your wife should take the master.

I think it actually makes sense to give the room to Queenie. That way they both will have the master at some point.", "Hasn't this been posted before?", "Absolutely NTA. If your wife was going to favor her child over her step-child, she shouldn't have married someone with a 5 year old at home whose mother had passed.

You and your wife should have made the decision about the kids rooms together. Instead you made the decision with Queenie and then tell your wife? \n\nI can see BOTH of your POV.

Fairest way.\n\nAs older children move out, \"best room\" goes to next oldest, who can spend the intervening time working out how they are going to redecorate :)\n\nI can however see a looming problem here. By the time the eldest moves out to college/wherever, the baby will be about 4, and the parents won't really need to have the small room to be \"near the baby\", and may want the master bedroom back, which leaves the son without \"his turn\" at the big bedroom.", "NTA but your wife is.", "I think Queenie should have the space!

I\u2019m paying for it, it\u2019s mine. Yeah, even if it\u2019s inherited I\u2019m still paying the taxes. End this argument by taking back the main bedroom.", "NTA and she is 10000% bogus. If you guys don't want that room it should go to her. Damn. How can you stay with someone like that? After the first remark like that it'd be over. I hope she doesn't say it around your daughter. I wouldn't trust your wife near her though. Wow.", "NTA. Makes sense the oldest should get the bigger room. When she leaves for college then the younger brother can have it for his turn. When she visits she\u2019ll have to stay in the smaller room. When I moved out for college I knew my sister would take my bigger room and change it around.", "NTA and the making the nasty comments about Queenie\u2019s dead mom is disgusting behavior\n\nEdited: Typo", "OP=NTA   AT least soft A-H for wife's comment\n\nIt is standard that the eldest child gets first choice of room in a situation like this(Unless there are special needs involved.  ie a room downstairs for a child with mobility issues)\n\nAlso a girl with it's own bathroom is definitely more a teenage girl thing then a preteen boy thing.  Plus Terrell will get it(unless you and wife do) when Queenie goes off to college.\n\nI'm sad to say, but this seems to be a *my kids deserve better than step-kids* attitude and I cannot help but wonder how often Queenie has seen this side of your wife while you haven't.", "NTA - but wow on your wife's comment about your daughter's dead mom. Your wife has known your daughter most of her life and still made that kind of nasty comment. She does realize that your daughter has no mom, right?
