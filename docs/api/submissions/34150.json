For three, unless you CONSTANTLY have children over at your place I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re in the wrong for not going out of your way to keep your gummies under lock and key. I have gummies sitting in a container in my fridge as we speak. I would never think of \u201chiding them\u201d because I don\u2019t anticipate children being over at my house anytime soon. My niblings come over maybe once a year and I\u2019m not really adjusting my whole life to prevent them from eating my gummies on one of those random off chance moments that they\u2019re actually here. Plus they actually know full well that they shouldn\u2019t go looking through my food without asking first, and you bet your ass my sister isn\u2019t gonna just let them wander through my house unsupervised when they are here.

Have you let the child get things from your pantry unattended before? \n\nYou\u2019ve said they are your best friend, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that far fetched to assume your house would be somewhat child safe if they visit a lot.

Absolutely, but he didn't, because he's 7, and 7 year old kids can be really dumb and impulsive and the pantry is where the snacks are. Even if you had \"hidden\" them, you basically left food-shaped drugs in a place where a kid would go looking for food. \n\nI keep my edibles in my linen closet in the bathroom, but when my niece and nephews come over, even though they're polite and wouldn't really have a reason to look in there for anything, I put them on the top shelf of my bedroom closet where they can't see or reach them, because that's the responsible thing to do and also it's really not that hard.", "NTA: I\u2019m sorry this happened and has caused conflict in the friendship.

Yeah, this reeks of bad parenting.", "NTA, i keep mine in my sock drawer, just for easy access and so I know where they are but you don't have any children of your own and they were there for a party not a long stay. My 6yo nephew knows to ask for food in his own house if it's something like candy or soda, so he definitely knows to ask before even opening the pantry in a house that isnt his. \n\nIf your friend can't trust their child to not get into shit, she needs to keep her eyes on her child. Also, to the commenters saying to put it in a med cabinet like other meds, i keep my meds in my kitchen because I take 5 a day and I like it to be near food and drinks bc I need both to take them. Just because its common place to keep them in the bathroom (though I've seen doctors warn against that bc of moisture) doesn't mean its wrong or bad to not do it. Also, the gummy bags and bottle's usually have hard to open seals, so if it was kept in its original packaging, that kid had to fight to open it which meant his mom didn't know where he was for more than a few minutes. I, a grown ass 26yo, struggle to open my gummy bag. a 7yo would definitely have issues too.

Actually, I guess we do know, and it's just lucky he didn't eat more gummies and end up in the ER.\n\nAs for you, you need to keep drugs out of the reach of small kids, especially drugs in the form of candy.
