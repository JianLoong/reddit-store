I'm already quite self-conscious about the fact that we tend to sweat a lot in the family, but on top of that I know my personal hygiene has a direct impact on the place I work's reputation. There's nothing I hate more than feeling like I smell bad.\n\nThis time I knew it was impossible I was still smelling bad, since I had gotten out of the shower not even 5 minutes ago. Usually when he tells me to shower I just don't say anything because I thought it was pointless to argue about that, but telling me to shower when my hair was still wet from the shower felt excessive", "Here's the thing, he's the only one (I'm super cautious when it comes to personal hygiene) but he's telling both my stepmother and I that we smell bad", "That \u201coutdoor\u201d smell repulses me! I\u2019ve taken a shower gone outside for 5 minutes, came back in and immediately had to take another shower because I smelled like outside! I live in nyc and  the dirt, heat and humidity in the air is awful and sticks to your skin immediately!", "Big thing - smelling like the outside, showering after being outside - for our Filipino relatives.", "No I can see that. There are plenty of people who don\u2019t shower properly. And that\u2019s were I was heading first. But I doubt that\u2019s the case here. I do get why some people asked about Covid. I k ow for some people that\u2019s been an issue since then, you said this has been going on since before. Sadly, I think if sweating has been an issue in your family, your dad probably deals with those same anxieties you do, but he also now puts these anxieties outwards to everyone else. It\u2019s not healthy.", "I apologize, I read that wrong.  I thought you said that she also told you that you smelled bad.  In THAT case, I do feel it's a him problem, not a you problem.", "That happened to me after pregnancy too! Not sure why, but it's amazing", "When we lived in NYC it made more sense haha!", "Hmm, they are very American! I'm learning a lot from this thread though.", "Every man on my dad's lineage (except one of my uncles for some reason) has had a problem with sweating. It's not like we stink; we're just drenched in our own, not so smelly bodily fluids. Not the worst you could've smelled, but still unpleasant enough to be uncomfortable with it.\n\nMy dad had to throw away quite a few polos because they were starting to lose their pigments in the armpit area, whereas I was spared to some extent by this curse (only thin white shirts have a low life expectancy with me). I sweat less than him, but I guess he's taken the habit to act as if I was the same (if not worse) than him on this matter", "It depends on how long someone has been outside, however I can smell \u201coutside\u201d on someone. My mom can smell it too. Normally it\u2019s followed with a \u201cyou smell like a puppy!\u201d Because it\u2019s not the most pleasant scent when it\u2019s mixed with sweat from a kiddo playing outside all day and it\u2019s normally said to my kid and not in a mean way at all. If it\u2019s said to an adult it is simply \u201cyou smell like outside,\u201d and sometimes it\u2019s mixed with sweat and not a pleasant smell and the comment is followed with \u201cyou need a bath before you get in bed.\u201d\n\nOne of my college teachers taught the class everyone has different \u201clocks\u201d in their noses and different smells act as the \u201ckeys\u201d so people do smell things differently and some people may not be able to smell certain things at all or just not as strongly as other people can.", " NTA. Maybe he\u2019s smelling himself. Tell him to get in the shower", "Are you using using soap all over your body? As well as deodorant? If they are saying you stink you probably do. You\u2019re not the AHole but you probably smell like one \ud83e\udd74", "NTA It could be any number of things. For me personally, I can smell when someone has been around something cooked in a fryer. The smell of the oil/ grease makes me nauseous. \n\nI also had a-symptomatic Covid. The smell issue for me started during my recovery. If you're able, sit down with your step mom and dad and try to see if he has specific scents that are more irritating than others. Either way, a trip to the Dr may be in order. Good luck", "After I got my sense of smell back, somethings still weren't right. For a couple months, I would randomly smell cigarette smoke (which I loathe) when there was none around. And my favorite soda tasted weird for like 8 months. It sucked, bc that soda was something I  loved and consumed daily, and it tasted off.", "Not defending anyone but I'm one of those weirdos that can smell the outdoors on someone. It isn't all the time and I wouldn't be an asshole about it. Hanging clothes outside to dry is wild to me. I don't know how people think they smell fresh. I know I have sensory processing issues and it's a \"me\" issue. Also, I love the outdoors. \ud83d\ude02", "sorry OP.  that's a rough situation.", "Me too!"]}
