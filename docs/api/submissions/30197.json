Honestly OP think about the fact that both her family, and yours would rather you divorce than the other family end up with the sofa they wanted. They don\u2019t give a shit about you or your relationship, it\u2019s on you and your partner to draw boundaries. Draw them and keep them there no matter the cost, you NEED them. Especially with people that get like this. It would also be wise to go low to no contact for awhile or atleast until they can take accountability and/or keep their mouths shut about it. You are about to move, it\u2019s the perfect time. It would also be wise for you and your wife to set up your wills asap and make sure that thing is iron fucking clad.

People thought they would get to choose what they wanted, since you asked them to pick what they wanted, but then you ended up not giving them everything they wanted because lists overlapped.

Or, do a lottery and first ticket gets first choice. Whatever it is, it needs to appear to be completely random and not favoritism.
