{"id": 17274, "submission_id": "13hxeh3", "title": "AITA For telling a girl's friends at school that I do not find her attractive in any capacity?", "selftext": "I am a high school senior and am in many of the same classes as a girl named Harley. Harley bullied some of my friends before the pandemic and, according to others, she hasn\u2019t changed much post-covid. The teachers don\u2019t do much when Harley is being rude, other than telling everyone to focus on the assignment. They don\u2019t do much about Harley even when she is being rude directly to them and refuses to listen during class/put away her phone. Since Harley is rich and also brags about her parents both being attorneys, my guess is that they either donate money to the school so Harley can get away with things or the school is afraid of her parents. I generally do my best to avoid Harley.\n\nUnfortunately, I got paired with Harley, two of her friends, and a random kid for a group project last week. For the project, our group got an article on an earlier unit from this year. Each group member\u2019s job was to summarize one of the pages of the article and then read their own summary to the class when our group was called up to present. So basically, the whole class can give each other a review of the information before the final. So my group had our chairs together but otherwise were just working independently and luckily didn\u2019t have to rely on each other in any way for the project.  We spent two days on the project, and Harley kept telling her friends how she bet that I was checking her out and wanted to kiss her since I\u2019m gay. (I\u2019m pretty open about being a lesbian when people ask. Nobody has really cared or caused any issues before this.) I just pretended not to hear Harley or her friends. I could tell she was getting frustrated, because she kept saying it louder/enunciating her words more while glancing at me, but I just kept ignoring her. \n\nAfter the project ended, Harley\u2019s two friends (Harley wasn\u2019t actually there) came up to me in the library asking if I liked Harley and wanted to date her, because Harley is \u201cafraid\u201d that I\u2019m attracted to her. I told them not to worry and that I truly do not find Harley attractive in any capacity. They both accused me of calling Harley physically ugly. I told them that I never said that I thought she was physically ugly, only that her personality makes her unattractive to me. They started laughing but luckily walked away so I went back to studying and forgot about it until later.\n\nHarley and some of her other friends (not the two who approached me in the library) have approached me and called me an asshole and said I was extremely rude and bullied Harley by saying what I said. I guess some people are teasing Harley about it now. I don\u2019t feel as bad for Harley because, as I said, I just said that her personality made her unattractive to me, not that she was physically ugly. Plus, we\u2019re seniors so people teasing her/joking about it won\u2019t even matter in four weeks. But were Harley and her friends right that I became the bully by saying what I said about Harley?

The girl and her friends said that I had been rude and was a bully by saying what I said.

They asked, you answered. Even if you would\u2019ve said you find her more repulsive than a pile of garbage sitting in the Texas sun while a trash panda vomits on it with rabies after ingesting crawfish and baby poop filled diapers, 100% justified response for her behavior.", "NTA  \nYou didn't bully her at all. In fact, it sounds like she was actively trying to get a rise out of you with what she kept saying during the project, and now is upset because it wasn't the response she was hoping for.", "NTA, she just wanted a reaction out of you to embarrass you/make you look bad and you turned it around and embarrassed her. Same thing as saying \"not my type,\" just a little more on the nose. If she or her friends bring it up again, I'd ask why she thinks lesbians don't have standards.\n\nPerhaps her friends misunderstood what you said, or it got changed somewhere in the gossip before it made its way back to Harley.", "NTA \n\nDon't even engage with any of her crew. She's not worth it and neither are they. \n\nNext time you're tempted to defend yourself or whatever, remember this old quote I read somewhere:\n\n\"It's better for them to wonder why you didn't say anything than to wonder why you did.\"\n\n- Author unknown.", "Nta. You\u2019re allowed your opinions and what you said wasn\u2019t even offensive considering the crap you\u2019ve put up with. If they didn\u2019t want your opinion, they should have kept to themselves. Harley is just riding the Drama Llama.", "Omgg NTA. Leave it alone. They're messing with you, causing drama, because THEY are the bullies. Surely you don't think you're an AH because you don't find a mean girl attractive??? Come on, now..", "NTA\nCan I just say, this girl must have a pretty big ego if she just assumes you must be in to her because you are attracted to girls... \nDoes she assume every guy is into her as well? \nShe clearly needed to be taken down a notch.", "NTA. You gave an opinion to 2 people who then went and told anyone/everyone who would listen and it sounds like everyone else is teasing her. This is probably the first time she's ever heard such a negative impression of her and she's just mad at you for speaking it aloud. Ignore them all, you're right that in 4 weeks none of those people will matter.", "BEYOND 1000% NTA! Some people just can't handle the truth. You weren't in any way rude about how you said what you did and everyone has different tastes. This main character Harley bit*h couldn't handle someone being unafraid to put her in her place.", "NTA. You provided a response to their question.", "NTA. They asked, you answered. I would say they had some diabolical teenage plan where they were going to use this against you. Then when you thwarted their plans all they could resort to was bullying. Best wishes to you after graduation.\n\nEdit for spelling", "NTA. You spoke plainly and truthfully, keep it up and congrats on high school graduation !", "NTA. Harley is just upset because she got called out. You were asked a question and you answered honestly good for you.", "NTA\n\nHarley is sexually harassing you. Talk to the guidance counselor.\n\nPersonally I think Harley is a closeted bi our lesbian, but it doesn\u2019t matter. She is bullying you", "NTA - Harley is upset you don't find her attractive. Boohoo! Harley thinks everyone should be stunned by her appearance. She isn't attractive, she's repulsive and shallow and, all things considered, you were kind", "NTA - Harley was wanting validation. She thought because your a lesbian that you would automatically find her attractive. She\u2019s butt hurt", "NTA. Harley started it with her asinine comments, her friends asked you a question, you answered it and bow Harley is pissed because she made a fool of herself. Fuck \u2018em (metaphorically.)", "NTA; don\u2019t waste a second feeling bad about about any of it", "NTA and even if you found her physically ugly so bloody what? Everyone is entitled to their personal taste.", "NTA.\n\nAnd well done for proving to Harley that karma is a bitch.", "This is graphic in the most excellent of ways. \nAgree totally.", "I tried to read this out loud and had to pause every few seconds to laugh lol.", "r/oddlyspecific\n\nIn a good way!", "> Does she assume every guy is into her as well?\n\nI guess she just assumes lesbians have no standards? I have encountered a lot of people online like Harley, who assume lesbians want to date any woman. Same people assume that gay men find any other man attractive. Luckily, I haven't had to deal with many of those people in real life. Or at least not the loud ones.", "Oh yeah absolutely. \nI'm a teacher and a big part of my course is about identity and of course, at some point we discuss sexuality and LGBTQ.\nOne of the things I hear the most from students that have a problem with people being gay, is that they will hit on them and be attracted to them and it will be weird. It's mostly guys, to be honest.\nI always tell them that if they think every gay man is into them, they need to check their ego because nobody, not even them, are that attractive.", "Yiu dont need to be attractive to fuck gay men.."]}
