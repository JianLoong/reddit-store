I am at a point in my life that I realistically just CAN'T take extra time to do this without ignoring my child and letting the business I run fall apart. I have been assigned a year to host for probably 10 years, it's in two years (I'm in my early 30s for an age reference). \n\nWIBTA if I told them not that I won't do it so they can move to the next assigned person?\n\nETA: The reunion isn't just a small picnic thing. It's all encompassing. There are rules about how many bathrooms/showers need to be available, a gathering area must be available, what types of lodging must be available, the number of events that must be planned/scheduled, food needs to be planned/purchased/cooked for 150+people. Dinner for Friday, all 3 meals for Saturday, and 2 for Sunday. All the while staying within the budget constraints or spending my own money out of pocket. \n\nI run a childcare center with ~130 kids every day and work 50+hours a week.

I don\u2019t do things I don\u2019t want to do. My free time is limited and I spend it doing things that bring me joy. \n\nJust because it\u2019s \u201calways been this way\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you have to take it on. \n\nWill there be some blowback? Sure. But do you really care? You\u2019ve not been attending and seeing these people anyway so what does it matter if some of them are pissed? \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Sooner better than later.  Get ready for the fallout.  But, don't allow yourself to be guilt tripped in.", "NTA\nIt\u2019s completely unreasonable for a family to expect one person to have their child\u2019s needs suffer as well as their livelihood suffer because of a single event, especially an event that the would-be organizer hasn\u2019t even attended in the last several years because their life is so busy right now.\nFurthermore you\u2019re being the responsible one by letting them know a full two years in advance.", "NTA. But you need to tell them NOW that you need to be taken off the rotation because of work and kids. No really is a full response. But they are counting on you so you need to speak up!", "NAH.  It's up to you.  If you want to pull out of this tradition, you can.  If people want to mosj at you for pulling out, they will", "NTA. People have their own priorities. Let them know asap so they still have enough time to do something about it. Since you haven't attended in a while and I assume you don't plan to in the near future...you don't have to worry much about weird looks, offended and 'disrespected' elders, blaming aunts and whatnot.", "NTA\n\nYou have to have good judgment and common sense about your limitations. You don't even attend when it's hosted by others. \n\nIf this reunion has truly become bloated and onerous, you are almost certainly not the only one in the family struggling to fulfill this obligation. This could be a good way to start a family conversation about the scale of this event, the burdens it imposes on the host and ways to make it simpler and less overwhelming for everyone. \n\nOTOH, if there are family members who truly enjoy doing it, maybe they could assume ongoing responsibility with support from those less able to be primary organizers", "Nta\n\nSomething like that should be a volunteer thing.", "NTA. They are being insensitive to you! And for that matter, your family! A family reunion is about FAMILY! You are part of the family and simply can\u2019t take the time, energy and effort to do the reunion work. It will cause issues, but please bow out for your own sake!", "NTA, they should understand that you are unable to.", "No, and if they were a caring and loving family as they should be, you saying no is totally fine. Don't sweat it mate.", "NTA. Let someone else do this. It sounds to be a ridiculous amount of trouble.", "NTA. Once a year is not a reunion. It\u2019s an annual gathering.", "NTA.  This is a voluntary family \u2018assignment\u2019, not a judicial summons/work-release program.  Notify them now that you are unable to shoulder the responsibility so they can move to the next appointed \u2018volunteer\u2019 immediately.
