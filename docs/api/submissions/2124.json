It's all encompassing. There are rules about how many bathrooms/showers need to be available, a gathering area must be available, what types of lodging must be available, the number of events that must be planned/scheduled, food needs to be planned/purchased/cooked for 150+people. Dinner for Friday, all 3 meals for Saturday, and 2 for Sunday. All the while staying within the budget constraints or spending my own money out of pocket. \n\nI run a childcare center with ~130 kids every day and work 50+hours a week.

It's up to you.  If you want to pull out of this tradition, you can.  If people want to mosj at you for pulling out, they will", "NTA. People have their own priorities. Let them know asap so they still have enough time to do something about it. Since you haven't attended in a while and I assume you don't plan to in the near future...you don't have to worry much about weird looks, offended and 'disrespected' elders, blaming aunts and whatnot.", "NTA\n\nYou have to have good judgment and common sense about your limitations. You don't even attend when it's hosted by others. \n\nIf this reunion has truly become bloated and onerous, you are almost certainly not the only one in the family struggling to fulfill this obligation. This could be a good way to start a family conversation about the scale of this event, the burdens it imposes on the host and ways to make it simpler and less overwhelming for everyone. \n\nOTOH, if there are family members who truly enjoy doing it, maybe they could assume ongoing responsibility with support from those less able to be primary organizers", "Nta\n\nSomething like that should be a volunteer thing.", "NTA.

This is a voluntary family \u2018assignment\u2019, not a judicial summons/work-release program.

I picked up a shift tomorrow, I was supposed to have off.  I'm infinitely grateful they let me, and even offer it to me tbh.\n\nIm their go to person with overtime because I never say no.
