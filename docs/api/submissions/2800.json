Our other friend, Harper, would share even less.\n\nYesterday I went out to dinner with Ava and Harper for my birthday. Halfway through dinner, out of nowhere, Ava looks at me, points at me, and goes, \"when was the last time you had SEX?\" and tapped her chin while looking at me. I was like, \"what? I am not answering that.\" Ava got offended. She get trying to press me to get an answer. Harper said, \"She doesn't want to answer that.\" Ava let it go but then she asked again half an hour later and I told her to stop. I said you are not listening to me and I am getting upset.\n\nAva has her feelings hurt now because she doesn't understand why I don't want to share this information with her while I feel so pissed off.

You never have to tell anybody anything, and if they don't like it they are free to walk away. What might have happened is that you felt pressured (because she was pressuring you) and you might have had an internal struggle between doing what was right for you and not upsetting your friend. The truth is, a friend doesn't pry, and expect or demand any details about your life. \n\nWhen you get used to saying no to people, you become calmer at just giving them a hint of a smile and saying nothing. You say no only once, then push the ball back into their corner as if to say 'now what are you gonna do?'. Going silent on people whilst still engaging with them is quite a fun thing to do, when you know, and they know that you know - they aren't being cool. But it takes practice.  I'm a woman, I'm not speaking for men or other genders , but it is a major problem that females have growing up and simply for the rest of their lives of they don't learn how to say no and be comfortable with it. Once you do it, it's like a new freedom. People start to respect you because they see the confidence behind it (instead of pushing you ) Then you realise you can say no to people on the street if you are busy, say no to people on the phone if you're not interested, say no to men who are talking to you in a way you don't enjoy, say no to friends who aren't willing to learn and respect and honour who you are. You can say no, all day long! Obviously.... That's gonna be a crappy day but, I just mean when you don't feel pressured anymore, you feel like a BOSS woman! No regrets, no nothing doubt.

So she has been selfishly chasing her desire to not only talk about all of her business, but intrude on other people's as well.
