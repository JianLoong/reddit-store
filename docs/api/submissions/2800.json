I had broken up with my ex 4 years ago and have not spoken about my romantic life since then because it was a messy breakup and while my friends were there for me, now I wish I didn't share so much about it because it was painful and embarrassing. Ava loves to talk about sex and while I was in the relationship with my ex I would share some things if she asked questions but never would go into any detail. Our other friend, Harper, would share even less.\n\nYesterday I went out to dinner with Ava and Harper for my birthday. Halfway through dinner, out of nowhere, Ava looks at me, points at me, and goes, \"when was the last time you had SEX?\" and tapped her chin while looking at me. I was like, \"what? I am not answering that.\" Ava got offended. She get trying to press me to get an answer. Harper said, \"She doesn't want to answer that.\" Ava let it go but then she asked again half an hour later and I told her to stop. I said you are not listening to me and I am getting upset.\n\nAva has her feelings hurt now because she doesn't understand why I don't want to share this information with her while I feel so pissed off. Just because Ava overshares everything about her sex and dating life doesn't mean everyone has to. I guess she was wondering if I hadn't had sex in 4 years but that's none of her business, imo.

This episode of sex and the city will hopefully have a funny ending where Carrie gets new shoes out of the dispute.", "NTA.  Ava overstepped.  Some people think they can get you to answer questions by badgering you.  I have one friend who asks highly personal questions because they think they can tell if you are lying or not.  Hard pass.", "NTA.  That's a very personal question and you are fully within your rights to refuse to answer.", "NTA. this is literally your personal life, you're not obligated to share it with anyone, even if you did in the past/they share with you. Ava needs to learn boundaries lol", "NTA and she needs to grow up.", "NTA. While I'm free with my sex life in discussions, that's me and me only. Ava needs to understand what she's as acceptable isn't the same for anyone else. Ava needs to respect boundaries.", "NTA. I get where she'd ask, it's something she is open to and comfortable talking about in casual conversation. But it's not something YOU are open to and comfortable with talking about. And that's all that matters.\n\nIt's an AH move to try to push you into talking about things you are not comfortable sharing and to keep pushing it like she did.", "You don\u2019t have to share anything about your personal life with anybody.

Let Ava be upset, she\u2019ll get over it. Also be honest with Ava about wanting to hear about her sex life. Ava can share if she wants but she should be respectful of who really wants to hear about it.", "NTA. Your bedroom activities (or wherever they may be LOL) are none of her business unless you want it to be. I have a friend who shares about her activities. I share a lot less.

Never.", "I\u2019m in a group of friends from college and we have the ones that love sharing all their details, and others that will share no details, and that\u2019s OK with the oversharers, why? Because it\u2019s none of our business. People deserve to keep their personal details, personal. NTA", "This is a simple black and white case of you are NTA. you shouldn't even question it. You never have to tell anybody anything, and if they don't like it they are free to walk away. What might have happened is that you felt pressured (because she was pressuring you) and you might have had an internal struggle between doing what was right for you and not upsetting your friend. The truth is, a friend doesn't pry, and expect or demand any details about your life. \n\nWhen you get used to saying no to people, you become calmer at just giving them a hint of a smile and saying nothing. You say no only once, then push the ball back into their corner as if to say 'now what are you gonna do?'. Going silent on people whilst still engaging with them is quite a fun thing to do, when you know, and they know that you know - they aren't being cool. But it takes practice.  I'm a woman, I'm not speaking for men or other genders , but it is a major problem that females have growing up and simply for the rest of their lives of they don't learn how to say no and be comfortable with it. Once you do it, it's like a new freedom. People start to respect you because they see the confidence behind it (instead of pushing you ) Then you realise you can say no to people on the street if you are busy, say no to people on the phone if you're not interested, say no to men who are talking to you in a way you don't enjoy, say no to friends who aren't willing to learn and respect and honour who you are. You can say no, all day long! Obviously.... That's gonna be a crappy day but, I just mean when you don't feel pressured anymore, you feel like a BOSS woman! No regrets, no nothing doubt. People can handle it! So long as you know you are not doing anything wrong.", "Sounds like she has been conversational topics from Sex and the City.    \nYou could ask her why she needs to know this information, since it is of such a personal nature that people do not ask.  And, although she does not realize this, most people do not share.  since she freely shares this information, you might explain to her about TMI and how it is important to respect one\u2019s own and other peoples\u2019 privacy. \n\nYou are NTA, and she needs to respect privacy of her partners and friends.", "NTA, let her be pissed. She deserves it for acting entitled to know about other people's sex lives. \n\n Instead of bringing it up again, she could have, maybe asked if there was a reason you didn't want to talk about it, since you'd been willing to talk about your previous relationship.", "NTA, let her feel upset.", "NTA This is com out of line on Ava\u2019s part. Why is this her business?", "NTA - but also you don't have to be quite so sensitive about it. She's probably just surmised you've been withdrawn after the breakup and wants to encourage you to get out and get back in the game. Her methods may not be to your liking but in her way she has your interests at heart.", "Nta, this is personal information and you don't need to share it with ANYONE.\n\nI would be more concerned with why she has decided she must know this information.  Her boundaries are all messed up, and this probably spills over into other areas. Be careful with what you say to her about anything", "NTA - Circle back to Ava if she is a good enough friend to worry about; \n\n\"I am sorry you feel I hurt you by not sharing about my sex life.  Please understand that one of my main regrets from my last break-up was realizing that I'd over shared private information. I learned from that and I no longer share those things.  You have no reason to be upset - It's not about you--it's about my personal boundaries, period.", "NTA. I hate talking about my private life and would shut down any conversation like that PDQ", "NTA, even if it isn't a romantic or sexual question,, nobody is entitled to any info about you which you don't wish to divulge yourself", "Nta", "NTA.

Why does Ava even wanna know SO badly? That's weird. Ava needs to get over herself and realize that you're all grown adults and people are allowed to have healthy boundaries and the fact that she's acting like the victim just because she isnt getting her way, you don't need someone like that in your life. Don't be afraid to set boundaries, especially about your very personal life.", "NTA. Ava is a gossip vampire trying to sustain herself with your tea. Friends should respect each other\u2019s boundaries. No means no. Having to say no twice to her and then deal with her sulkiness on YOUR birthday. Re-assess if she\u2019s worth keeping around, it\u2019s ok to outgrow people.", "NTA.  Everybody will probably think I\u2019m ancient, but some things should be kept private. Someone\u2019s sex life should not be discussed like the weather.", "NTA.  Say, \"havin' it now.\"", "NTA, I mean it sounds like you're blaming yourself for her intrusions on your privacy, when you in no way set up a dynamic where she is allowed to demand your sexual information.\n\nBasically what this reads as Ava is being rude, and has been for a while, because she finds sexual information very satisfying. So she has been selfishly chasing her desire to not only talk about all of her business, but intrude on other people's as well. If she's coming up to you now to try and guilt trip you for not giving her what she wanted, you need to clearly lean back snd tell her.\n\n\"You don't have the right to demand this information from me. I gave you my answer, I shouldn't have had to say it a second time. Don't ask me about my sexual information anymore. And I don't want to hear about all of your sexual details anymore.

Does that count?\"  Let her know it's none of her business.", "NTA \n\nI suspect the only reason Ava asked this question was '***so you can ask her'.*** the same question and so she could begin to boast about it and in turn *lord* over the subject, but when you refused to engage Ava has to shift her ground and find another reason as to why the dynamic isn't going her way, I often find people who cannot help to avoid a specific topic often holds deep-rooted inadequacies and anxieties about the topic in a vain attempt to display confidence where there is in fact a lack off, after all, if they talk about it all the time they must be comfortable about it, right? It's a defensive mechanism to hide away how they truly feel about something, in this case **sex**. \n\nIf she does it again do exactly what you did before and rinse and repeat as and when needed, she'll learn in time or eventually find someone else to vent this particular topic with.", "NAH. My girlfriends and I talk about sex. If that\u2019s not something you\u2019re comfortable, that\u2019s fine. But maybe you\u2019re just not compatible as friends.", "Help yourself!
