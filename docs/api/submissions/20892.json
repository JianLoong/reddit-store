Every time. Even if he cries. \n\nDon\u2019t buy in to your roommate\u2019s attempt to steal your dog. If he is keeping you from your dog, you should retrieve your dog. \n\nIf your roommate is sleeping and has Jack with him, call Jack through the door.

Nada. \n\nNTA", "Why do you think the roommate isn't TA?", "[deleted]", "I truly hope you're right, but it won't hurt for OP to prepare for the worst.", "NTA\u2014this is laughable. Your roommate can\u2019t afford to support the dog, but then can\u2019t even be bothered to take the dog outside??? You have to do it when you come home from work when the dog spends all day/night/whatever period of time with your roommate? If your roommate really cared about the dog and wanted to have him as their esa, they could at the very l e a s t show respect and responsibility towards the dog by doing things to take care of it that are FREE\u2014like filling his bowl or taking him outside. \n\nSounds like your roommate wants all the joy of pet ownership with none of the responsibility, and is cloaking it in a veil of \u201cnecessary support\u201d by calling your animal an ESA. Your roommate is delusional and couldn\u2019t handle the responsibility of taking care of a living being even if they COULD afford it. \n\nYour roommate is weird and you should probably have a chat with them about boundaries when it comes to your pet and the care you are responsible for providing to your pet, as it obviously needs to happen on YOUR time schedule.", "NTA Jack is OP'S. Let the roommate get his own dog. I really think you really need to get rid of the roommate. It will only get worse. One day, you may come home and find the roommate  has disappeared with Jack.", "NTA  \n\nIF YOU HAVEN\u2019T ALREADY PLEASE GET JACK MICROCHIPPED !! Your roommate has no right to claim your dog as his ESA. It\u2019s great that your roommate and dog get along so well, but you need to set boundaries. Your dog is your dog, end of story. No more overnight sleepovers if that affects your schedule. I would also be very afraid that your roommate will one day leave with Jack and not come back.", "NTA. When you get home from work, open your roommates door and get your dog. I wouldn't be trying to be quiet for someone sleeping, either. Open the door, the dog probably runs to you. If not call him by name and tell him to come.\n\nIf the door is locked, knock on it non-stop until it opens and you get your dog. I'd do this every time. He is welcomed to the dog as long as you take the dog when you get home.", "NTA. Roommate is TA. \n\nDon't wait, wake him up and get your dog. \n\nShelters are full of nice dogs. Roommate is full of shit.", "NTA. Your roommate is unbelievably entitled. Tbh I would be so fucking offended if someone tried to slowly take my dog from me, I would move out. I don't trust it. I wouldn't even want my dog around that person without my supervision. It's just weird.", "What fucking lunatic thinks it's ok to steal someone's pet AND have the owner keep paying for it as well? I mean Jesus Christ is his brain just a big single cell?  NTA and don't let him guilt trip you with his new buzzword. If he really needs an esa then he can go and get one.", "NTA. This is your dog, not his ANYTHING, no matter what he deludes himself into thinking. Make sure your dog is chipped and registered on you so this little shit doesn't try to steal him, I have a really bad feeling about this.\n\nAlso.. in all honesty... lots of red flags. I'd look for a new roommate or a new flat.", "NTA open that MFs door and let your dog out.", "NTA. Wake your roommate up when it's time for Jack to go out.

He is not to pull this shit with your dog. It's YOUR dog.", "NTA. Jack is your dog. Not your roommates.

This behavior borders on scary.", "If your parents or significant other live nearby, I'd be inclined to suggest that you leave Jack with them until you get your roommate situation sorted. You didn't provide enough detail about him, but he sounds too unstable to be living on his own if he believes he has cause to take Jack from you. Jack is, in my opinion, your baby brother, and I sure hope you wouldn't sell *him*.\n\nNTA", "NTA Dude is gradually stealing your dog.", "NTA. Someone can\u2019t just claim someone else\u2019s dog as an ESA. It\u2019s not his dog. You also shouldn\u2019t have to wait for him to wake up before taking your own dog outside.

Tell him to leave your dog alone and find/train his own ESA.", "Nta. Wtf???  You can't go around demanding to have people's pet given to you. Honestly, that is creepy as hell. He needs therapy asap and YOU need to cut his BS asap too. \n\nHonestly, I would ask my parents to let my dog stay with them, and I would either move or kick my roommate out if I could. But if you do move make sure to put your dog in a safe place way before announce it, because he will probably try to kidnap your dog.", "You need to have a conversation with him & set boundaries.  Tell him Jack is not allowed in his bedroom ever.  Remind him Jack is your dog & he cannot use him as an ESA.  Putting the dog in your room before you leave is not fair to Jack.  ESH", "This is exactly the case. OP keep your documents showing your ownership over Jack under lock and key. \n\nKeep that chip up to date. \n\nIf you move out and take jack with you I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your roomate claims you stole his ESA. You need to make sure if the police come over to retrieve jack that you can show proof of ownership. \n\nI would also look into if there is a friend jack can stay with while you\u2019re at work. It does mean maybe losing a bit of sleep. But if it means Jack is interacting less with your roomate it might be worth the temporary discomfort until you can move out. \n\nNTA.
