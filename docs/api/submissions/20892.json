My roommate only tries this while im at work, so he would only be alone in my room at night while he's sleeping anyway.", "Agreed! But maybe it's best that the roommate doesn't get his own dog yet since he can't afford to. \nHe could volunteer at a local animal shelter though! That way he could both get AND provide some emotional support! \ud83e\udd70", "My roommate has a lot of medical equipment in his room and he has it safe from animals (he used to have a cat not much smaller than Jack) but if I accidentally bumped into something or somehow messed something up it could be very dangerous for him, and a lot more expensive to replace than I could afford if I broke it. \n\nHe also sleeps with noise canceling headphones on so the attempts I've made to wake him up haven't worked. \n\nAnd I know Jack is in there with him, safe and sleeping, trust me if I thought Jack was in danger nothing would stop me.", "Jack can't get out of the room until roommate gets up and let's him out. Roommate sleeps with noise canceling headphones so I can't really wake him up. And Jack is always sleeps right up until my roommate gets up, and Jack is a weirdly heavy sleeper (I didn't know that was possible for a dog until Jack). So I can't wake up Jack from outside either.", "I think the sitter is key. You do not want to entertain this weird obsession fantasy. If he just really liked hanging with the dog then nothing would be wrong.  But this guy wants ownership over Jack. He wants to have OP bankroll Jack being his dog. This feels obsessive and unhinged. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to have Jack at home and inaccessible because if roomates mental health is actually a lot worse or devolving you don\u2019t want to be out of the house and have your roomate escalate to regain access to the dog.", "I mean dogs can\u2019t open doors and if there isn\u2019t a lock then the roommate will just grab Jack anyway. \n\nI think the better solution is having a friend outside of OP\u2019s apartment watch the dog during working hours until OP can move.", "You're vastly overestimating how difficult it is to open for a firefighter to open a locked door", "I just don't understand what the big deal is to open his door and take the dog out when you get home.  Your dog will get into that habit, ans it is sad for a dog to be alone in the room when there are other people (that he knows well!) home.  As I said - no one is really being an actual AH here....but you're just not using common sense.", "Yes exactly that's an amazing idea.", "So room mate is LOCKING your dog in his room?", "You're SO right and phrasing it better than I ever could.\ud83e\udd27\ud83d\udc4f\nThis situation may not seem like anything serious to some, but it's scary how things can actually go and beyond imagination \ud83d\ude22(for example a couple of years ago i read somewhere that someone stole and bleached someone else's pet to make it \"unrecognisable\" \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 ppl can so scary)", "They would likely just bust the door down. My sister locked herself in our shared bedroom when I was 5. She was 3 and was playing with the lock when it broke. And my mom called the fire department. They just broke the lock and the door was opened. It took them less than 2 minutes. It took them longer to ensure my sister was healthy and safe since they did a quick check over just to make sure she wasn\u2019t hurt. She was all good and confused at why people where making a fuss.", "Yep. And mental health is serious. And frankly you don\u2019t want to put the roomate in a worse situation by just keeping the dog right out of reach. It\u2019s not healthy for him or your pet. \n\nMental health is serious and we as a society need to not write it off. Listen between the lines of what the roomate is saying. He\u2019s attached to the dog and feels like he needs the dog. That is not normal."]}
