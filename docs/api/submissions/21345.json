He's way too young to be expected to care for any animal and his parents are raging assholes for joking about the animals they have killed.", "NTA - the kid is clearly too young to be in charge of an animal's welfare and their parents are not picking up the slack. Get them a stuffed turtle plushie or a plastic one", "NTA for saving an animal in danger, but a little bit the A for directing all this animosity towards such a young child.  \n\nHe\u2019s 4, he\u2019s going to get distracted and forget things, if his parents are going to leave him in charge of animals they should supervise him until he can prove over an extended period that he\u2019s going to be responsible in his handling of them.  Your cousin, and to a lesser extent your dad, are responsible for this happening, for enabling the neglect and for effectively offering the child the turtle without consulting you, and maybe you\u2019re a little responsible for not asserting yourself at an earlier stage.  The child is a child, and does not deserve the he hate and accusations you\u2019re sending his way in this post.", "NTA absolutely, you could have avoided the family drama explaining to your dad the story you heard and it may be too young to have a pet. but please stop calling a 4 years old murderer. There is a reason cause they shouldn\u2019t be entrusted with living creatures. They are too young to know better, they can\u2019t even take care of themselves. He is not a murderer, he is a toddler.", "clearly NTA  \n\n\n1) she was YOUR turtle  \n2) rescuing animals from abuse is always ok  \n\n\nI'm not saying it's your cousin's fault. He's four. It's definitely his parents' fault though for not teaching him that this is wrong and that animals aren't objects.", "ESH (except the kid). Dad obviously shouldn't have given away your animal without asking you. Kid's parents shouldn't have taken in another animal when the last ones died. But OP- there's so many things you could have done differently, like asking your dad in the moment not to give it away, talking to him after the fact and voicing your concerns and asking him to try to get the turtle back, or you could have have talked to the parents directly and voiced your concerns. I don't know if you're just afraid of confrontation, but again, this wasn't the best way to go about this. You also should have fessed to taking the turtle, instead of letting things spin out of control.\n\nAlso, stop calling the 4 year old a MURDERER. That's so messed up. He is too young to understand and care for animals on his own. He didn't do it on purpose. It's his PARENTS' faults for not helping him take care of the previous turtles. They should have realized he is way too young to take care of animals on his own, and helped him. If anything, you should be mad and focusing this wrath on THEM, not a child.", "ESH. You're not the AH for taking back the turtle, you had every right especially considering they are abusing the turtles. But you repeatedly calling the kid a murderer and the use of \"brutally murdered\" is just so fuckiing dramatic. The kid didn't crush them, he put them somewhere and forgot about them. The kids stupid, he's four. The real turtle murderers are his parents considering they are adults with functioning brains, they should have been caring for the turtle. You're pointing fingers at the wrong person dude.", "ESH. You should have said something at the time, not stolen the thing, and you especially should have fessed up instead of causing your family all this turmoil. All of that is entirely your fault. However, your dad never should have given the turtle away without speaking to you first. And the kid and his family are AHs for getting animals and not learning how to care for them properly (or at all).\n\nYou aren\u2019t the AH because you didn\u2019t want the kid to have the turtle. You\u2019re the AH because you didn\u2019t stand up to your family in the first place and either tell them no, because you are attached to the turtle, or teach them how to take care of it. But they\u2019re all AHs too.", "This is unhinged. You've referred to a *four year old* as a 'murderer' about ten times here for... not being old enough to responsibly take care of pets? None of this is his fault. His parents shouldn't have let him take home another turtle when they're not going to take care of it. But it also doesn't sound like they 'kidnapped' the turtle, they genuinely thought the turtle was a gift. It's kind of insane that instead of stopping them from taking the turtle home in the first place, you decided to steal it back a week later, unnecessarily upsetting a small child and damaging your relationship with his family. YTA, this is bizarre behavior.", "NTA. Even if your family members didn't all act like entitled AH's when they stole your turtle and gave it to a child t kill, no one has any room to complain while they're mistreating and torturing an animal. Your cousin needs to pull head from ass and be a better parent because she is doing a poor to terrible job, if this is anything to go by. You didn't destroy anything, just remember that. If your family members think you're the bad guy in this situation, they need to give their heads a shake.", "Soft YTA for not intervening at the beginning when your dad gave Ginny to your cousin. Don\u2019t call a 4 year old a murderer, that\u2019s horrible. Why didn\u2019t you tell you dad about the turtles dying and stop them from allowing the turtle to leave in the first place?", "NTA. The Kid isn't mature enough for animals. And the parents are unbelievable idiots. You saved your turtle. \nTurtles can get really old if they're loved and cared for. My mother's family has one for over 60 years.", "Definitely NTA for stealing the turtle but the four year old is not a murderer. He\u2019s four.", "NTA but you should have told your parents your aunt let their child kill his previous turtles and how you found it weeks later", "NTA, its Animals abuse on the parents' part go to the police or pet shelter and tell them to not sell any animal, especially turtles, to them. Do you really want more turtles dying", "I've definitely seen stories on her that are exactly the same with different animals subbed in for turtles, this screams bait to me", "ESH. Your dad for giving the turtle away, the kids parents for not teaching their kids proper animal care and letting the kid get a new turtle without doing so, and you for calling a kid that doesn't know better a murderer and stealing his pet. \n\nYou could have spoke up right then when your dad was giving the turtle away and explained to the kid how to care for it, or when you saw the turtle you could have gathered kid and parents and gave them tips and explained how to care for it better.", "YTA dor repeatedly calling a 4 year old a murderer, a clue that you're going over the top with all of it. It's the parents' fault for not taking care of the turtles. The child is 4. He doesn't know any better.", "Wow, YTA for calling a 4 year old a \"murderer\".  What he IS is a 4 year old child with horribly irresponsible parents when it comes to having pets.  You, on the other hand, are a duplicitous adult thief.  YOU need to tell your father the truth so that your horrible behavior doesn't destroy your father's family.", "You didn't steal a turtle. You saved its life from a turtle killer.\n\nI hope no one realized what happened, because then they'll snatch that poor animal back.\n\nYour relations are really vile. Animals are not toys for a four-year-old to torture in a tiny jar or kill. And don't tell me he's too young to understand. If he's old enough to own a living being, he's old enough to understand.\n\nNTA", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why didn't you speak up when your dad took the turtle away from you? It's your pet and you're 23. Time to grow a spine and stand up for yourself and your pets. A week was long enough for the animal to have been tortured and have died. Fortunately it was still alive. What will you do the next time?", "NTA\n\nFirst and foremost you didn't \"steal\" the turtle, you simply reclaimed what was yours\n\nSecondly this child is clearly far too young to be looking after animals", "But he did murder the turtles and his parents are co-conspirators.

Unnecessarily upsetting small child? That thing is a murderer. A turtle is a living breathing being that should be protected. NTA and I would never speak to that part of the family again over this. I hate people who don't take the lives of animals seriously.", "what are you talking about? I agree that the OP was out of line for calling the child a murderer, he's just a little kid, but how is taking back her own turtle being a duplicitous thief?", "No, the parents killed the turtles. The kid is 4.", "Four-year-olds aren't even capable of keeping *themselves* alive without help, let alone other creatures. It is absolutely unhinged to call the four-year-old a 'murderer' in this situation. You can take the lives of animals seriously without projecting insane pathologies on small children.", ">my dad was chill at first but her perseverance progressively made him angrier and more defensive not knowing that i in fact did take ginny back.\n\nWell, I guess it was the part where she stole the turtle back without anyone knowing about it.", "And he stuck the turtles in a drawer. A psychopathic murderer.", "I definitely don't think that makes OP an Ah, but I see your point :)", "The word murder implies intent. I very much doubt that the child intended to kill the turtle. He\u2019s a 4-year-old who doesn\u2019t know how to care for an animal properly. His parents are the ones responsible.", "Dude, he's 4. 4year olds can't comprehend death. He probably though the turtles would be warm and cozy in there.", "Not necessarily, murder can also fall under willful neglect. I agree however that a 4 year old should not be the sole owner of any animal. Parents are also murderers."]}
