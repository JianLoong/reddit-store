Your cousin, and to a lesser extent your dad, are responsible for this happening, for enabling the neglect and for effectively offering the child the turtle without consulting you, and maybe you\u2019re a little responsible for not asserting yourself at an earlier stage.  The child is a child, and does not deserve the he hate and accusations you\u2019re sending his way in this post.", "NTA absolutely, you could have avoided the family drama explaining to your dad the story you heard and it may be too young to have a pet. but please stop calling a 4 years old murderer.

It's definitely his parents' fault though for not teaching him that this is wrong and that animals aren't objects.", "ESH (except the kid). Dad obviously shouldn't have given away your animal without asking you. Kid's parents shouldn't have taken in another animal when the last ones died. But OP- there's so many things you could have done differently, like asking your dad in the moment not to give it away, talking to him after the fact and voicing your concerns and asking him to try to get the turtle back, or you could have have talked to the parents directly and voiced your concerns. I don't know if you're just afraid of confrontation, but again, this wasn't the best way to go about this. You also should have fessed to taking the turtle, instead of letting things spin out of control.\n\nAlso, stop calling the 4 year old a MURDERER. That's so messed up. He is too young to understand and care for animals on his own. He didn't do it on purpose. It's his PARENTS' faults for not helping him take care of the previous turtles.

You're not the AH for taking back the turtle, you had every right especially considering they are abusing the turtles. But you repeatedly calling the kid a murderer and the use of \"brutally murdered\" is just so fuckiing dramatic. The kid didn't crush them, he put them somewhere and forgot about them.

You're pointing fingers at the wrong person dude.", "ESH. You should have said something at the time, not stolen the thing, and you especially should have fessed up instead of causing your family all this turmoil. All of that is entirely your fault.

But it also doesn't sound like they 'kidnapped' the turtle, they genuinely thought the turtle was a gift.

You dub him a murderer for leaving turtles in a drawer.  What the heck is wrong for you? blaming a 4 yr old for improper care of turtles.  Do you think he(or you) are born KNOWING how to care for animals?????  I NOTE you were SIX NOT FOUR when you first started to care for the Turtles(and likely had decent supervision).\n\nI can ONLY hope you don't/didn't say this in front of the child.  I know someone who was about the same age and was given chicks to play with, the child(also about her age) encouraged her to help them grow.  She thought she was supposed to do that by stretching them--she broke their necks--mother had to pay for dead chicks.  That person 70plus years later still remembers that experience traumatically. SHE DIDN'T KNOW BETTER she was little more than a baby--just like this 4 yr old\n\nSECOND, you are 23--an adult--NOT 13, you should have USED YOUR WORDS and took Ginny from the child and said to the parents, *I'm sorry, I DON'T think a 4 yr old has the skills to properly care for a turtle.*\n\nTHIRD you are blaming this child for the too small jar and the bad care--THAT is on the PARENTS not a FOUR YEAR OLD CHILD.  (ETA according to post--your family provided that jar before the turtle left the house)\n\nFOURTH for being too much of a Coward to admit what you did and causing a RIFT between brother(your dad) and sister.\n\nYour Dad gets some suck for offering up turtle and THE PARENTS are AHs for not making sure the turtle is properly cared for.", "ESH\n\nThem for enabling bad behaviour, you watching them walk out with your pet and not speaking up like an adult.", "ESH - I had to reread your age when you were calling a 4 year old a murderer.

The parents are total AH's for allowing this mistreatment of helpless animals. Your dad is also an AH for simply stealing your pet to give it to a child who has already been associated with the death of several animals and is in no way able to care for a pet at this time. \n\nSuggestion to diffuse things: Maybe you could get another turtle and \"give\" it to your cousin under the very strict rules that he only gets to visit it at your home and has to learn how to care for the animal until he is older and has demonstrated his responsibility and empathy are sufficient to be a pet owner. He could have regular brief visits to get to know the proper way to care for his pet and have time with it over the next several years. If he loses interest, you have another turtle. If he matures and is able to become a good caretaker, then the turtle can go home with him when he's 9 or 10 at the earliest. You might also want to insert a wellness check clause in the bargain so that you can keep an eye on things for the first while after the pet goes home.", "NTA because obviously what you did was in the best interest of the turtle. \n\nHowever, you handled this poorly. I get that is awkward, but you should have said something to your dad as he was giving Ginny away.

Who just randomly gives away a pet to a family member?  \n\nI would say though that anger at this child rubs me the wrong way.  The one to blame here is not the 4-year-old.  It's his parents who are irresponsible.  A 4-year-old is not capable of understanding that he's hurting an animal.  He doesn't have that level of insight or empathy.  He's not capable developmentally of caring for an animal himself.  His parents need to supervise him and ultimately be the ones providing for any animals in the house because they're adults.  I've had small pets (mainly rodents) my whole life.  We had small pets when my kids were four- and you bet that it was me ensuring they were fed and cleaned and me supervising ANY interaction with the kids.  Because I don't want my kids getting bit or my guinea pigs/hamsters/hedgehogs getting injured.  Stop going off on a small child for being a 'murderer.'  If you have to go off on anyone, go off on the parents for putting a living thing into the hands of a child WAY too young to be responsible and not ensuring its health and safety.

The AH is your dad for taking the decision out of your hands and then you for not speaking up. I think you might have to say something at this point.", "Adding a vote for ESH. You 1000% should have spoken up in the moment your dad gifted the turtle. The kid's parents suck for not teaching their 4 yo proper care of an animal nor keeping track that their kid is taking proper care. They further suck for accepting a new pet when the last one(s) were so poorly cared for. You suck again for not having a real conversation with your dad about your concerns after it was gifted, and at no point did you try to educate the kid/kid's parents on proper care of the turtle and express your concerns to them over a pet you were taking care of that they are now in possession of.\n\nThe only two people that potentially dont totally suck are your dad and kid, depending on the circumstances. It's hard for me to blame the kid entirely if they weren't educated on proper care of turtles in the first place (but if they were with the prior turtles, then slight AH but they still should've been highly monitored at that age). It's also unclear if your dad was aware of the demise of the prior turtles (which would obviously influence whether or not he's an AH), and if Ginny would have been considered a \"family\" pet (in which case reasonable he gave away as it sounds like there are no shortage of turtles in this household, and it was a way to connect with a nibling- therefore NTA) or if she was \"your\" pet (in which case, AH for not discussing with you first).", "NTA.
