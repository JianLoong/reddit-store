Now that we are more comfortable around our son ourselves we are open to having friends and family come around a bit more.\u00a0 Over Memorial Day weekend we planned a pool party/cookout and invited a lot of friends and family to meet our son.\u00a0 Many of them met him for the first time.\u00a0\n\n  \nMy brother (25M) lives a 3-4 hour drive away and has not met our son.\u00a0 He has not met his nephew because his work schedule is fairly seasonal and his job slows down significantly in May. Pre-baby we held pool party's frequently and he'd regularly drive into town for them with his german shepard.\u00a0 I'm indifferent about his dog, i'd never want the responsibility of one myself, but his dog is fine.\u00a0 He'd always ask about bringing his dog to parties and I laid down some rules for\u00a0him.\u00a0 He had to clean up after it, it stayed outside, and it wasn't allowed in the pool. Outside of 1 or 2 instances over the years we've had problems.\u00a0 Now the issue here is that I don't want his dog to come over anymore because of our son.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n  \nI informed him ahead of time of this new rule and he was pissed.\u00a0 He says everyone loves his dog and its never been an issue.\u00a0 I told him things are different now.\u00a0 We have a young kid.\u00a0 I told him i've only ever seen his dog around adults, never children.\u00a0 Its not worth the risk for me, if god forbid something happened it would destroy our relationship.\u00a0 I asked him if he could leave the dog at home this time.\u00a0 He called me an asshole and said he wasn't coming.\u00a0 You are going to pass on meeting your nephew because I won't allow your dog anymore?\u00a0 You can't go one party without him?\u00a0 He said its the principal of it all and its bullshit that i've changed up the rules on him.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWell the party came and went and  it was great, but we are still having issues.   I got tons of questions about my brother and told them he had to be with his dog this weekend and left it at that.  I was mad he wasn't there and I think people could tell when discussing him.  AITA for my new rule?", "created_utc": 1687194704, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dkfqe/aita_for_now_allowing_dogs_anymore_at_my_cookouts/", "score": 600, "replies": ["NAH. You\u2019re a new parent. Of course you\u2019re worried about your kid. \n\nHe\u2019s not an asshole for deciding not to come, though. He lives far away. He\u2019d have to leave his dog for a long time.", "NAH\n\nYour house your rules.  If you're not a dog person, then I can see it.  I know that people can get nervous around my dogs even though they are much better with kids than adults.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut he's far away, and leaving a dog for that long is hard.  He'd probably be able to come down, visit for an hour and then have to drive back to take care of his dog again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWould you be ok if he came to visit with his dog, but not during a big party?  That would be easier for you to keep an eye on your child and the dog and how they interact.", "NAH - Your house, your rules. Do I think youre overreacting, yes. But its still your house and up to you to decide. \n\nIm not going to blame him for being pissed and not going either.", "Perhaps consider timing: it's 3 hours each way for your brother. So, that's 6 hours of driving, plus party time. That's a long window for a dog owner to be away from home in some circumstances. It's your place, so you can dictate a no dogs rule, but you'll have to understand that your brother is unlikely to attend gatherings very often. \n\nHave you considered a separate \"meet and greet\" time for the dog and your little one? German Shepherds can be great with kids and your kid might get a kick out of your brother's dog once they're a toddler. Pro tip--larger dogs who are baby friendly are great for toddlers to hang onto as they learn to walk. I grew up with our family's Great Dane as my first baby sitter. He would pick me up by my overall straps and place me back within my Mom's reach when I first learned to run and would outpace my parents. He would also swim with me and be a flotation device, play outside with me, cuddle with me, walk me to school with my Dad and stand between me and the curb, retrieve toys I lost from my high chair, etc. He was patient, gentle, and loving. My parents taught me early on how to read his body language, how to be careful not to hurt him when petting him, all that jazz. Not every dog is baby or even kid friendly but the ones who are...they're amazing!", "NAH-only because he may not be able to leave the dog for that long.\n\nYou have every right to not want the dog around your baby. However, the dog is his responsibility and he may not be able to visit as much because he can\u2019t leave the dog alone for so long", "I was all set on NAH until you say at the end that you\u2019re mad at him. \n\nI think you are fine to be paranoid about dogs at this stage of your kid\u2019s life.  I think he is reasonable to not want to leave his dog home alone for 10+ hours. \n\nTo be mad at each other and refuse to see the others\u2019 viewpoint pushes me really close to E S H. You both need to show some empathy.", "I'd say NAH. \nI don't have kids so I don't know if you're being over-protective or if no dogs is normal policy. Either way it's your house and your party so your rules.\nHowever, if those rules don't work for him then that's fine too. He respects your rules and that means he's not there.", "Info.....if the dog is outside, and the kid is only 4 months old, how would the dog have access to the baby?", "ESH. Your choice is sensible IMO, and he should not argue with you about it, but at the same time, you have no right to be resentful of his choice either. \n\n>You are going to pass on meeting your nephew because I won't allow your dog anymore?  You can't go one party without him?  \n\nFor starters, it's not just this one party; presumably it's every party until your son is older. This is no minor thing. For two, your son does not automatically outrank his dog in his mind, your kid is the most important thing TO YOU, not everyone else. You have no more right to be mad about this outcome than he does.", "So soon this means that the OP is never gonna go visit his brother because his brother has a dog? So the brother is expected to drive a 6 to 8 hour round-trip every time he wants to see his nephew. This is a preferable solution, then to try to see whether or not the dog is going to be fine around the child. \n\nI think ESH\u2014 it\u2019s one thing if the person lives around the corner but that\u2019s a long time to leave an animal, who may have never been boarded before and never had a sitter. \n\nAnd dogs and cats and animals are around everywhere. Not all of them are child friendly, but some of them are, so it is the OP\u2018s rule in the OP\u2018s house, but he has to live with the fact that not everybody\u2019s gonna agree with the rule. And it could end of really restricting their social life if they\u2019re not gonna go anywhere with pets either.", "NTA.  Your house, your rules.\n\n  \nOf all the dogs I've had, I would only allow 1 around strange kids.  Nothing bothered that dog.    He was the best dog ever.\n\nThe others?  Were dogs.  Dogs gets spooked and kids don't always act in a predictable nature.   I would never put my dog at risk with an unknown baby/toddler/child. Nope.\n\nKeep them apart.  Such a simple solution.", "NAH.\n\nYour house and rules. However, your brother would have to leave the dog for 8+ hours and made the choice to not come as a result. That makes sense to me as well. \n\nHe shouldn't be pissed about it but equally you need to respect that he wasn't able to come because he may not have been able to find someone to take care of the dog while he was gone. \n\nIt's like 'don't bring your kids' thing. If you can't find a sitter then you don't go. \n\nPerhaps a compromise could be that you meet halfway somewhere so he's not having to make the long drive and leaving his dog for a long period of time, and it means he gets to meet your nephew. If he can't bring the dog or is always expected to have to find a sitter (which is valid) then I can see it becoming an issue. \n\nA halfway point could ease that burden?", "YTA. Is your child already walking? Is it crawling outside? If you\u2019ve already banned the dog from inside the house then it wouldnt be inside. If your kid is still being carried around by adults and held you think\nThe dog is just going to jump up\nAnd bite it? Like dude. Kids need socializing with animals like animals need it for people. This is a dog you know and an environment you control and a great opportunity to start socializing your child. What scenario in your mind would the dog harm the baby?", "NTA\n\nYour house, your rules.\n\nA party is not the best place for a dog and a small child to meet for the first time. There's already so much excitement around and its easy for the pup to get riled up and hurt the kiddo on accident.\n\nIf both you/your partner and your brother are willing, it'd be best to see how the pup acts around your kid in a quiet controlled environment. \n\n\nBased on that interaction you and your partner can decide if you're comfortable with dogs at future parties.", "You're NTA. \n\n>He says everyone loves his dog \n\nNo, everyone does not.\n\n>I told him i've only ever seen his dog around adults, never children.  Its not worth the risk for me\n\nYou are 100% in the right. Your brother is acting like a pouting child.", "ESH.\n\nYour house, your rules. \nBut you suck for being pissed he\u2019s not coming. You set the boundary. He made his choice off of the new rules.\n\nHe sucks for getting mad. It doesn\u2019t matter whether or not he agrees with the rule because it\u2019s not his property. He should\u2019ve just said that he wasn\u2019t coming because it wasn\u2019t fair to leave his dog for 12 hours in the kennel and left it at that.", "ESH \n\nYou laid down your boundaries. Brother laid down his. He doesn\u2019t get to be mad that you are prioritising your child over his dog. Equally you don\u2019t get to be mad that he is prioritising his dog over your child. Everyone has different priorities and it is unfair to judge someone else\u2019s priorities for not aligning with your own.", "YTA for being mad at your brother for refusing to attend.\n\nYou changed the rules, and it's your house, so it's up to you, BUT you don't then get to be pissed that he rejects that rule and chooses his dog.", "YTA", "NTA - for the new rule.  Your house, your rules.\n\nHaving said that, I am concerned that you think your son is made of glass.  I don't think I would introduce him to a large dog at 4 months, but your comments sound paranoid about your son.  You do need to allow your son to be a baby and to not be so protected that you make him paranoid of the world around him.", "Info.....if the dog is outside, and the kid is only 4 months old, how would the dog have access to the baby?", "Nta it\u2019s your house.", "NTA. I disagree wholeheartedly with everyone that says N-A-H. He\u2019s 100% TA for not understanding that a huge life changing event, such as having a baby, warrants a second thought of nearly everything that was normal prebaby. Had he just said, hey, I don\u2019t want to leave my dog that long so I\u2019m going to stay home, then I\u2019d say he\u2019s not.\n\nEdit to add: I am a dog owner who makes decisions based around my dogs", "NTA. I have 2 dogs and no kids. They\u2019re very rarely around kids, and if they are, they\u2019re leashed and obviously supervised because we\u2019re on a walk. First thing I probably would have done in your brother\u2019s situation is ask if you were cool with the dog around the baby, and then accepted your decision.\n\nI have a friend who we\u2019ve dog sat for several times. Her kids are 4 and 7. She\u2019s repeatedly asked to return the favor, but there\u2019s no way in hell. One of my dogs is bananas about kids, but she doesn\u2019t know her own strength (we are working on this). The other was in an abusive situation before we got him. His triggers have all but dissipated in the 6 years we have had him, but leave it to a dog-loving 4-year-old to pull some stunt that spooks him just the right way. They\u2019re both bulldogs, so a bite can definitely draw blood.", "NTA from a new parent and a dog owner. I bring my dog everywhere I can with permission but I have never be concerned or upset when he's not invited. For example he loves going to my sibling's house to visit their kids but their dog is coming to the end of her life so they asked that we leave him at home when visiting for now so it doesn't add extra stress for their dog.\n\nYour brother is upset, I get it. But he's TA for making this such an issue especially because it seems like he can leave his dog and just doesn't want to.\n\nYour house, your kid, your rules.", "Tell him to check out pet sitters with good reviews in your neighborhood-surely he can find someone to dog sit for cheap and he can even be close by if he has safety concerns or whatever \n\nNTA", "NTA but he also is NTA. I understand not feeling comfortable leaving your dog home alone for 10 or more hours and it's your house so your rules stand but he doesn't have to come if they don't suit his needs. So as long as you know your alienating your sibling because he has a responsibility to his dog do what you feel is best", "Not the asshole and quite frankly I prefer dog-free events. I have several family members that bring their untrained animals to every get-together and it\u2019s extremely annoying to have them constantly jumping up on you, getting into the trash, trying to get food off the counters/tables, and nonstop barking. You\u2019re especially right for the reason of keeping the baby safe since you don\u2019t know how the dog will react to him. Better safe than sorry.", "NTA. I\u2019m a dog lover but a dog is still a animal and you can\u2019t predict it\u2019s behavior.

I'd be a bit miffed if I was your brother but it's your home and your rules. Tho I may be miffed I wouldn't take it out on meeting my nephew. I hope you don't plan on keeping dogs away from your child forever but I could certainly understand at the age your son is at now. I'd remind him of that as well. It's likely a temporary set up until your son gets a bit older.", "I think ESH because personally I\u2019m annoyed by uptight, panicky parents AND people who think their dogs need to be allowed everywhere, all the time.", "NTA. You don't want dogs around your child and that's understandable. You're also not a dog person you conceded in the past but now you have something more you would like to protect and you're not required. Although I don't think you can get mad just realize you're a relationship obviously doesn't mean as much to him as his spending time with his dog and adjust accordingly", "YTA\u2026but out of general ignorance of being a new parent and way too over protective", "First and foremost... your house, your rules.\n\nI am not a dog person.  I like dogs and I don't wish any harm on them, but I find them annoying.  They are always sticking their noses where most people don't want noses, slobbering all over, and jumping up on you... whatever.  My sister has 4 dogs, 3 of them are big dogs that have no concept of personal space.  I hate going to her house for that reason.  But some people love their dogs and see them as their kids.  That's fine, I get that, that's how I feel about my cats.  But I wouldn't assume that I can take my cats into someone else's home, and then get all butt hurt when they tell me I can't bring my cats.\n\nHas your brother's dog ever been around a baby?

People have to respect that.  \n\nThat said, how old is the dog, and what's its temperament?  Most dogs are **great** with kids.  My stepson has a pit bull, and she is the biggest baby...  loves the grandkids and is very protective of them.  German Shepherds are great dogs, very protective, not aggressive.  So, an alternative would have been to let him bring the dog, but keep an eye on it...  and tell him to have a plan B to board it or cage it if it displays concerning behavior.", "NTA, because it's your house and you get to decide if pets are allowed or not, and your brother is wrong to make this big a deal about it when I expect he leaves his dog at home all the time.\n\nthat being said, i'm not sure what you are concerned about with the baby.  were  you hoping to leave the baby unattended in the back yard?", "NAH\n\nYou have the right to decide if you want or not a dog in your home, but driving basically 8 hrs round trip and leave my dog unattended for that long would be a no from me so i would ski.", ">AITA for my new rule?\n\nNo and there is not even an explanation needed.

There is no way you are the TA.  NTA", "NTA.\n\nDogs meeting new babies at a pool party is a potential recipe for disaster.  There is too much going on and you've said the dog has had issues before.  You are allowed to change the rules anytime you like but especially when the situation has changed (e.g., new baby).\n\nYour brother is a bit of an A H for requiring you to allow his dog (you don't mention that it is a service dog so going with the dog being a pet).", "NTA\n\nThere is zero reason a large dog, or any dog, that is not part of your family to be around an infant, toddler or small child.  There is too much at stake here for a chance to be taken.\n\nNow it may have been received better if instead of saying, I dont want his dog to come over anymore, say, its probably best not to introduce your dog to a toddler just yet.  \n\nWe have 2 Akitas, these guys are bred as family protectors and are known for their tolerance of small children.  BUT, there is NO way I would even dream of bringing them to someones house much less someone with a toddler.", "YTA. Keep the dog outside, the kid inside. Problem solved.\n\nYour pool is a bigger danger to your kid than a dog.", "YTA - but not until the very end for this sentence:\n\n>> You are going to pass on meeting your nephew because I won\u2019t allow your dog anymore? \u2026 I was mad he wasn\u2019t there.\n\nYou yourself have stated you\u2019ve been particular who is around him for the first for months.

You made a choice about his dog no longer being welcomed. That is fine. He\u2019s allowed to make a choice to not come.\n\nBefore anyone says but the brother is also at fault for arguing with the rule. The brother is allowed to reasonably lobby that the new rule isn\u2019t valid if it\u2019s going to hinder him from coming, like it did. It\u2019s better for him to lobby for an exception than to just say, \u201cfine, then I\u2019m not coming\u201d, because then he sounds like a toddler.

Dogs can be unpredictable and if a dog owner claims that their precious pooch is not a threat then they are irresponsible. The dog could be fine - it could also not be fine, which would result in a pretty bad outcome. My grandmother had dogs and she was in the room, with her son also watching the granddaughter - the next moment the dog had clamped onto the baby's head, attempting to shake her.

If you want to introduce the dog to the baby, it would be best at a time dedicated to just that. \n\nAs far as your brother goes, it doesn\u2019t matter if everyone loves the dog - it is a matter of the baby. And, yes, having a baby changes *all* the rules.", "ESH.\nYou can do whatever you want regarding your kid your house. \nHe shouldn\u2019t take it personally.\nBoth of you should be working together to be open to introducing your child/his dog, if and whenever you are ready and definitely in a less chaotic environment than a pool party with a million distractions. If you had stated this was the eventual goal and explained why you were nervous, and/or showed understanding that he also is a responsible pet owner that doesn\u2019t like to leave a dog kenneled or alone a long time and you respect that, maybe it wouldn\u2019t have escalated so much. New moms are unapologetically protective, it\u2019s instinctive and I\u2019m right there with you. \n\nTip from an ER nurse- kids who get serious injuries from animals are typically kids who are unsupervised by adults, people of any age not used to being around animals, and don\u2019t know how to correctly recognize animal behaviors. The more your child has supervised time around animals while they are still a young child , the safer they will be when they are at a friend\u2019s house with animals, a stray approaches then, etc. But there is no mad rush.

That\u2019s what we do with family members (including little ones!) and friends anytime someone new meets our husky.

Then we leash up our dog and introduce him with control of the leash so we can put him back in the house/another room if we detect the slightest change in behaviour that isn\u2019t friendly.", "Not the asshole!

Now that we are more comfortable around our son ourselves we are open to having friends and family come around a bit more.\u00a0 Over Memorial Day weekend we planned a pool party/cookout and invited a lot of friends and family to meet our son.\u00a0 Many of them met him for the first time.\u00a0\n\n  \nMy brother (25M) lives a 3-4 hour drive away and has not met our son.\u00a0 He has not met his nephew because his work schedule is fairly seasonal and his job slows down significantly in May. Pre-baby we held pool party's frequently and he'd regularly drive into town for them with his german shepard.\u00a0 I'm indifferent about his dog, i'd never want the responsibility of one myself, but his dog is fine.\u00a0 He'd always ask about bringing his dog to parties and I laid down some rules for\u00a0him.\u00a0 He had to clean up after it, it stayed outside, and it wasn't allowed in the pool. Outside of 1 or 2 instances over the years we've had problems.\u00a0 Now the issue here is that I don't want his dog to come over anymore because of our son.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n  \nI informed him ahead of time of this new rule and he was pissed.\u00a0 He says everyone loves his dog and its never been an issue.\u00a0 I told him things are different now.\u00a0 We have a young kid.\u00a0 I told him i've only ever seen his dog around adults, never children.\u00a0 Its not worth the risk for me, if god forbid something happened it would destroy our relationship.\u00a0 I asked him if he could leave the dog at home this time.\u00a0 He called me an asshole and said he wasn't coming.\u00a0 You are going to pass on meeting your nephew because I won't allow your dog anymore?\u00a0 You can't go one party without him?\u00a0 He said its the principal of it all and its bullshit that i've changed up the rules on him.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWell the party came and went and  it was great, but we are still having issues.   I got tons of questions about my brother and told them he had to be with his dog this weekend and left it at that.  I was mad he wasn't there and I think people could tell when discussing him.  AITA for my new rule?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You\u2019re in your right to not allow a dog at your house and brother overreacted by \u201cgetting pissed\u201d but when you got mad back and stayed mad enough to let it effect your party imo that cancels out. Your brothers not wrong for declining to drive 3-4 hours EACH WAY to hang out for an afternoon, especially since he would now have to find someone to take care of his dog. And also, I know a lot of people are getting annoyed about him wanting to take everywhere and \u201cdogs aren\u2019t babies you can leave them home alone\u201d and what not, but the way OP\u2019s brother chooses to care for his dog is his choice. \n\nI have two dogs. If I had to travel 8 hours round trip to meet my brother\u2019s infant I would want to stay for a few hours to at least make the drive worth it, and then I\u2019d have to pay someone to come by halfway through and let my dogs out to go to the bathroom and get exercise. Idk I\u2019d probably want to wait for a better time too given the circumstances.", "NTA.  It's understandable that you wouldn't want a big dog around your new baby, especially if he has no history with children.  Your brother is overreacting and could very easily have left his dog at home for the day.", "Not everywhere allows dogs.  I love dogs, but I leave mine at home.

He shouldn\u2019t have called you an AH and you shouldn\u2019t have shown others that you were mad at him.  I have turned down family Christmas and every other family gathering out of my area for almost 2 years because my cat required daily sub-q fluids for her chronic kidney disease.  My family understood.", "NTA. I'm expecting my first child and while I personally share your view on dogs, a cookout is not the right environment to introduce an animal to a small child. If you did want to have the dog meet your child, that'd better happen in a more controlled environment with less people there. \n\nHonestly though? The entitlement your brother shows makes him TA. Not everyone loves his dog, and not everyone has to. Dogs are animals and do not need to be in every space humans are.", "YTA:  not for making the rule, your house your rules.  Don't complain when people who don't want to follow those rules decided not to come over.  You procreated, congratulations, but not every will finds that a priority.

If the dog is outside are you letting your 4 month outside by himself? Is he crawling out there? Not sure why they would even come in contact?

Not sure why it would be a problem if there hasn't really been any before?", "NTA for changing the rules.\n\nThough you are an AH for being pissed at him for not coming. He can abstain from coming to your events for whichever reason he wants. If he values keeping his dog company more than seeing his nephew for a day, that is a totally valid reason.\n\nHe is also the AH for not being respectful about the rule and being more polite on his reply though, to be fair.\n\nESH.", "NTA but certainly on the line. I can\u2019t fault you for being a worried parent, however you have no reason to assume his dog will be vicious or harm your child in any way. But hey, it\u2019s your house, your rules. But your bother is NTA either for not wanting to come. \n\nI parents have a pit bull mix (Dakota) who many people take one look at and just assume she\u2019s mean because of her breed/size, but they couldn\u2019t be more wrong, especially around children. And over the years we have gotten increasingly more annoyed when people assume because she has done nothing to ever support their assumptions, and it\u2019s gotten to the point where my dad refuses to go to any social settings without her.\n\nEver since my cousin was born (she is 5 now) Dakota has loved to cuddle and protect her, and whenever an adult gets \u2018rough\u2019 with her (not really rough, more like plays tag and grabs her at the end, she\u2019s laughing the whole time) my dog springs into action and tries to protect my cousin from the \u2018danger\u2019", "NTA. Not every dog is kid friendly and why would you put your baby into a potentially dangerous situation? He could've easily had someone watch the dog overnight but he wanted to be a baby", "NTA Your house, your child, your rules. If you aren\u2019t comfortable with the dog around your baby, then don\u2019t allow. Your brother also has the right to not like the rule and not come.

Especially important things like meet your nephew", "This is simple:\n\nIf you don't want pets in your house for any given reason, it's your right to have your boundaries, NTA", "NAH but grow up.  You don't want your kid to be afraid of animals. My work partner is TERRIFIED of dogs.  We get called to a house with a dog, of any size, and she hides in the ambulance until I personally assure her the dog is secured. That's something you probably want to avoid.  You're on the line of being OVERProtective.  There's enough helicopter/snowplow parents out there: please don't join their ranks. \n\nUnless there is a lot and I mean A LOT you're not telling us about this dog, like violent or aggressive behavior, you're being extra.", "NAH but how often is your kid left unattended outside? I think being a new parent made you over react which is cool. You're allowed. Then he overreacted by shouting and getting pissy. Not by not coming. No asshole but you both could do with relaxing a tad. \nYour baba won't be on the floor outside and I can't see the dog owner letting him get near his nephew dangerously. 90% of dogs recognise our young as something to be protected. \nExplain you are just scared cos you are a new parent and might be slightly irrational due to thr importance of this baby for you. Wanting to protect it no matter what. Have a think about this before you both regret arguing over something so silly.", "YTA.\n\nI was NAH right up to here:\n\n>  You are going to pass on meeting your nephew because I won't allow your dog anymore?\n\nYes, he is, and your attempt to pass some sort of negative moral judgement on him is laughable.\n\nHe's allowed to not want to leave his dog alone for, lets see, twelve hours.\n\n>  You can't go one party without him?\n\nThe problem with this weak attempt at shaming somebody into compliance is that it works the other way, too.  \"You can't go ONE PARTY without leaving your, lets see, 4-month-old son in a crib inside with a baby monitor?\"", "NAH\nIt's your party, at your house.  \nBut don't call your brother an a h, because he won't leave his dog for entire day.  \n\nIf it were me, I would prefer the dog to meet the baby while he's a baby, and not wait until he's  a toddler.  What are the chances of a 4 month old crawling around and pulling a dogs tail?\nIf the dog is vicious enough to actively hunt down the baby, while it's being held or in a crib,  I would hope your brother would stop him and take him away immediately.  \nBut yeah, your house, your rules.  At the same time, you can't make ppl come to your party and leave the family that is completely dependent on them (dog).", "Info: \ndoes he need the dog for medical reasons? Or is the dog a pet? Does he have a place to put the dog or a dog sitter? Or will the dog be alone for 3-4 hours to travel there then time for the party then the 3-4 hour drive back? \n\nIf he lived two doors down then and doesn\u2019t need the dog for medical reasons, then he would be an ass. But if he needs the dog to get thru the day or if the dog will be alone for 13+ hours with no one the care for it then you\u2019d be the ass. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want the dog near your baby then fine but you can\u2019t expect him to leave his dog alone for that period of time.", "NTA. Your house your rules.", "NTA, but if the dog is only allowed outside and not allowed in the pool, what was the probability the dog would have interacted with the baby? Dog could have leashed and could have asked brother to bring a crate. He could have also found a pet sitter. Thi knyou both could have made it work. But NTA because it is your house Nd your rules.", "MORE INFO: you said you were particular about who could be around your son before, was brother on the clearance list? If he was, did he know what times work best for you and your wife to come visit?", "INFO: Has your brother introduced the dog to other small children before? What was the reaction like then?\n\nI'm inclined to lean towards N A H (or E S H, depending on how quickly both of you were to get accusatory with the 'How *could* you change the rules?' and the 'How *could* you prioritize your dog?'), because I also have a dog, and for a 3-4 hour trip (is that one way, or round trip?) that would at least require a dog walker to come by, or possibly a petsitter to stay overnight/a night in the kennel, which can be expensive and stressful to the dog. Especially depending on how much notice you gave him, he might not have been able to make accommodations in time.\n\nI think it's reasonable to not want strange dogs around your kid, especially if they've never been around babies before. I also think it's reasonable to not be willing/able to leave your dog for hours at a time unexpectedly, especially if it feels like someone's changing the rules mid-game. I don't think it's fair for him to flip out at the request, and I don't think it's fair for you to accuse him of not caring about you/your son because of it.", "Im reading PPA in this post that needs addressing. Your house, your rules and you can set that boundary. \n\n\nBut this party should not be the only opportunity your brother has to meet his nephew nor should it be only the second opportunity he\u2019s gotten. \n\n\nI think his reaction is within reason especially since you aren\u2019t at all making it seem like you want him to be part of your child\u2019s life. Why should he go out of his way to make arrangements? \n\n\nNAH. But consider the possibility of PPA and PPD for both you and your wife.", "Is there any room for compromise? Maybe he could bring his dog but put him on an outside teather in a shady area with a food and water bowl so the dog doesn't have free range to run around?", "NTA.. the dog will be ok or he can hire someone to watch it for a day. it\u2019s a large dog. it doesn\u2019t need to be around a baby. \n\ni have two belgian malinois that are well trained. because i paid through the nose for it. i STILL would not think of bringing them with me to meet a new baby. that\u2019s absurd. i would want to meet the newborn not be on guard for my dogs bcuz they\u2019ve not been around babies before. your brother being lax about it makes him an AH. i\u2019d have anxiety. \n\nand i wouldn\u2019t even want them crated up there bcuz all it takes is one idiot ti open the crate and disaster happens.", "NAH\n\nYou're doing what you think is right for your kid. \n\nYour brother can't leave his dog for hours, and is irritated you believe the dog is violent. I'd be irritated if someone pretended my extremely safe dog was violent too, and expected me to ditch her. \n\nBut your house and your kid, so your rules, and he should respect your fears over your first kid.\n\nYou just can't be mad at your brother either. What's he supposed to do, be a shitty dog owner for your preferences? He can't do that. I guess you both will just have to see each other less and choose to not be shitty about it.", "ESH.   You had every right to say no and he should have accepted that. \nBut he lives too far away to just pop over for the day without the dogs- your child isn\u2019t walking or crawling- how hard would it be to keep the baby and the dog separated?", "Unless the dog has a track record of being aggressive, yta for excessive paranoia.\n\nBut also you equivocally without exception get to decide who and what is allowed in your house, so that bit is nta", "NAH.\n\nYou're a new parent so naturally you're going to be extra protective of the new baby.\n\nBut I wouldn't come either as I'd have to leave my dog at home for the better part of a day and dogsitters and kennels aren't cheap", "NAH, but as a fellow GSD owner without kids, I probably wouldn\u2019t come either. How you feel about your son is how your brother feels about his dog. Imagine being told your son can\u2019t go somewhere.", "Yta", "NAH. You have the right to change the rules now that you have a child but I don't blame your brother for being a little upset. He was able to bring his dog every time and now it has changed, I personally would probably be a little upset also if i was him. I personally wouldn't leave my dog alone for that amount of time and being 3-4 hours away, I wouldn't feel comfortable doing that. I would make other arrangements if possible like a trusted friend or family member who could watch him while I was gone.", "YTA you really think the dog is going to eat your child or something", "YTA 6 hours round trip plus the amount of time to stay at the party. Then you have the nerve to get upset that he doesn't want to do that if he can't bring his dog. Him not coming should not have been a surprise. He obviously loves his dog. If you care so much that he meets your kid then take to him and do the drive yourself.", "Wait....\n\nI could have sworn I saw the brother post this issue from his perspective  \n\nIs his dog a skittish adoptee??????", "YTA. Just because you've had a kid doesn't make you special or the centre of the universe. Prepare to lose your brother if you don't accept his dog child.", "NAH, you\u2019re looking out for the baby which is obviously priority! That said if he\u2019s used to popping over with the dog I can see how definitely he\u2019d be taken aback and disappointed, but he should have worked through that himself and not gotten upset at you. You also can\u2019t really be mad at him, you set a boundary and he did comply, even though the result isn\u2019t what you probably hoped for. \n\n\nOk, now just some musings ~ \n\nI do hope at some point brother and doggy can meet the baby in a more controlled, lowkey environment and that the baby won\u2019t be kept away from the dog forever, just my own 2\u00a2. I think as long as you and your bro are on the same page about being hyper vigilant and making sure the dog isn\u2019t unattended *and* that the baby doesn\u2019t accidentally aggravate the dog, things should be fine. I grew up with shepherds and as dogs go they are especially curious and loving AND intelligent. I honestly believe if the dog sees your brother being super gentle and careful with the baby he would mimic his behavior. I *personally* would rather introduce a family dog to my baby as an infant, where I have total control, than when the baby is a toddler or more mobile and is reaching out and grabbing onto things.\n\nI do have questions because you say \u201cif anything happened it would destroy our relationship\u2026 I asked him to leave the dog at home *this time.*\u201d Does this rule have an expiration date? Like, is he never allowed to come over with his dog again in case your kid wants to play outside where the dog stays and the dog is potentially always going to be unpredictable? \n\nThat\u2019s a different story than \u201cI just don\u2019t want dogs at this particular outdoor party since they\u2019ll be sharing space the whole time\u201d or even \u201cI don\u2019t want a dog around the baby until we\u2019re more comfortable in general, which I don\u2019t know when will be.\u201d Either of those are clear and fair. \u201cYou can never bring your dog to my house again because we have a child now and something *might* happen\u201d seems a little more harsh IMO. Like, are you never going to drive anywhere with the baby? People crash their cars at a far more common pace than babies get attacked by dogs. Just a thought exercise. \n\nAt the end of the day it\u2019s your house your rules, but you can\u2019t be mad at how those rules color peoples\u2019 decisions to come or not come visit.", "ESH\n\nNor for saying no dogs at party and not for not coming. \n\nESH, because OP is mad at brother for not coming and brother is mad that dog can't come. Neither reason is good enough to be mad.", "Yeah, that would be a no for me too just because of the distance. If it was in town, no big deal but this is sounding like an overnight thing and that means a babysitter or boarding. \n\nNAH seems like the right call.", "Agreed. If the brother is 3-4 hours away he could only basically stay for an hour before heading back to take his dog out and feed it and that's pushing it. \n\nIn the future he can make plans to have a dog walker or dog sitter or kennel take care of his dog for the day/possibly overnight.\n\nThat said, I've been the brother in a situation like this and simply did not have the $ or trust to pay for services like this. It really sucked. My trip wasn't as long but still, I'd have to take a bus for almost 2 hours each way. The schedule wasn't set up so it ran regularly. I'd often only be able to see family for 2.5 hours before being dropped back off at the bus station. (I used to make carpool arrangements for someone to drive me and my pup). \n\nIt sucks to be in that position. And if you're really bonded to your dog, rejection of the dog (especially a very chill and well behaved one like mine) can feel in part like a rejection of yourself. That's not something that I'd even try explaining to family though.\n\nI understand why the brother was upset. He probably felt that his dog was part of the family in a way. But he should have been understanding and said that he'd plan for other arrangements for his pup so that he could join the next event and meet his nephew.\n\nAll that said, how old will the child have to be before the parents are comfortable with the brother's dog? At a certain point kids do interact with animals, it's part of life. Kind of unavoidable in our society. A newborn, I understand being extra protective of. This will also be the parent's choice that the brother will have to respect.", "This!   If it is a 3-4 hour drive, that is a minimum of 8 hours of leaving the dog alone, not including however long he stays at OPs house.   Getting a dog sitter or kenneling a dog can be expensive", "He is an AH though. Not for declining, but the way he did. He blew up on OP acting as if they are out of line for no longer allowing the dog at their home. It is OPs home at the end of the day, and even if it wasn\u2019t because of a new baby, OP is within their right to change the rules about the dog at any point in time. \n\nBrother wouldn\u2019t be an AH if he simply said that he won\u2019t be able to come. But making a big stink about \u201cthe principal\u201d of not wanting a large dog with no history around children at the home of a 4m old baby is an adult tantrum.", "NTA. I was terrified having my own dog meet my own baby. I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t do it during a party 4 hours away in an unfamiliar place.", "I can understand someone's love for their dog but the brother could have planned something for his dog so he could meet his nephew. OP's concerns are legit if the dog isn't used to being around children something can happen and we don't want the dog to be unalived because he might try to play with the kid and injure him.", "I mean I would get a dog sitter so that I could go meet my new nephew if this was the case. I guess it really depends how close they are to begin with.", "A solid compromise might be to see if brother has a trusted pet sitter and to offer to either cover it, or go half in on it. But again, brother may not agree to it on principal alone.", "Brother is an asshole for saying the new rule is bullshit and OP is an asshole.", "It\u2019s really not that hard. I know a lot of ppl talk about their dogs not liking to be alone and having anxiety etc\u2026 but I refuse to believe it\u2019s as pervasive as Reddit makes it seem. I had dogs all throughout my life and we left them alone all day while adults worked and kids went to school etc. and they were fine. A normal dog should be able to spend a day without their person. People have lives outside their homes.\n\nAlso, boarding exists, doggy day cares exist ( most dogs actually enjoy the day cares! New smells and friends!), AND since everyone loooves bro\u2019s dog, surely there is a friend or neighbor who\u2019d be willing to care for the dog. \n\nIt\u2019s just a stupid hill for OPs bro to die on.", ">But he's far away, and leaving a dog for that long is hard.  He'd probably be able to come down, visit for an hour and then have to drive back to take care of his dog again.\n\nIt's a dog, not an ICU patient.  Put it in the garage, leave out enough food and water for a day longer than you're planning to go, and some training pads.  As long as it doesn't bother the neighbors and you've removed hazards, no worries.", "Agree.  He could have made a rule that he had to be leashed and the leash held at all times. Typically dogs bite when older children are cruel or on accident when a child has a dog toy or food (miss the toy/food and instead get child).  That\u2019s not a risk with an immobile 4 month old.", "You say that but my husband almost lost an eye as a toddler when his aunt's dog, perviously a very sweet, good boy, lost his mind at random and attacked him.  He's still got the facial scars.", "The sweetest animals can be triggered by kids who don't know boundaries, and a large party where all the adults are going to be distracted in some way, shape, or form, isn't the situation to put an animal and a baby in together at the same time. All it takes is one warning nip from a dog telling the child no and animal control is intervening and saying the dog needs to put down. \n\nIt is in fact stupid for the brother to be insisting his dog should come, because his dog is in danger. Animal control doesn't give a shit if the parents don't want to press charges, it's still a mark on the animal as reactivity.", "I'd disagree. The brother is an asshole for being petty and saying he's not coming out of principle. People are well within the right to change the rules at their own home, and he's being an absolute asshole for getting mad and calling OP an ass and saying it's bullshit that they changed the rules. \n\nThe fact that the brother threw a fit and refused to see his new nephew is ridiculous. Sure, it's three hours away, but he could always find someone to watch the dog or have it boarded for one night.", "Someone get inattentive a door gets left open because oh I need to grab this. Oh and doesn\u2019t matter anyway if they don\u2019t want the dog there the dog doesn\u2019t go.  Plain and simple.", "The baby and dog will be in the same area.  I'm of the opinion it takes one second for an accident to happen.", "Great question", "This right here folks.", "Good point. How long is this \u201cno dog\u201d policy gonna go on for?

That\u2019s a lame argument", "Yeah, I never knew how unpredictable and horrible dogs were around kids until I had a kid. Friendly dogs bite kids for no reason, maybe prey drive? Idk, I'm not a dog psychologist. All I know is every time a dog has charged or bitten at my kid, she's been in a completely different area minding her own business and had no idea there was a dog there until it got to her. And I'm RIGHT THERE, too. They're fast and unpredictable, and for some reason, they hate kids.\n\nI have a very, very strict no dog rule now. A lot of people in my family no longer see my children because enough dogs have tried to attack her and they're on the dog's side.", "And it's also reasonable to not go because of that. OP is gonna be the AH if he doesn't just accept that his brother can decide to not come if he doesn't want to.", "If he\u2019s a few hours away he would have to drive say 3 hrs, stay an hour or two, and then go back home. He can\u2019t leave his dog at home for hours.", "He said it's 4hours each way. That's at least 10 hours of leaving the dog alone if you're lucky and there's no traffic.  Maybe he wouldn't need overnight care but he'd need to hire someone for that day.", "Yes! The PRINCIPLE. The principal is on a pedestal. Brother\u2019s reason isn\u2019t worry for his dog. Isn\u2019t stating if he can find an all day sitter or a kennel. Doesn\u2019t show care of missing out on a new family member. Doesn\u2019t list care of dog or baby but is angry because of the *principle*. \n\nYeah, brother\u2019s an ass.

Go to the bathroom and get inside.   It's rude AF.  Now I wish the people across the street with the 3 children who love to scream like they are being murdered and keep tossing paper and crap in my yard would give me the same respect I've given them with keeping my dogs under control.", "So I agree with all of that. I have skipped tons of events because of my pets, and I totally agree that the brother has to do what he has to do. But from what we\u2019ve been told, the brother isn\u2019t claiming any of that as the issue - he said it\u2019s the principle of it that bothers him, and he\u2019s just pissed that OP is changing the rules now. To me, that makes the brother an AH.", "I would definitely be super excited to meet the dog nephew!", "This comment is ridiculous.  \n\nThe party is to see the baby.  If family wants to see the dog brother where he lives", "Thanks. I feel like I\u2019m taking crazy pills with the way all these answers are going!", "Not surprised that the teenagers on this sub don't see what's wrong with this picture tbh.\n\nYou'd rather hang out with your dog than see your brother's newborn?  What tf is wrong with you?", "I'm not dismissing that choice.  I'm passing judgement on it because this is AITA and the entire reason for this subs existence.\n\nIMO, someone who can't leave their dog at home for one night to meet their new nephew is a major asshole and anyone who defends that choice with the drivel you've responded to me with is a total lost-cause.", "It\u2019s probably not even the cost of boarding the dog for the night. \nI wonder how much notice was given. All the non horrid kennels here at always booked up way in advance. If I wanted a Saturday day and night next week, hell even the next few weeks after that, there would be no chance of getting a spot.", "oh. i missed that part then. thank you!", "He should\u2019ve at least made an effort to meet him.

Meeting him isnt important??", "And I hope you don\u2019t have any kids in your family. You\u2019d honestly put an animal over a human being? Don\u2019t ever have children.", "But that\u2019s the point. When you get an animal, you assume the cost of having one. And if it\u2019s an animal like a dog, you should be prepared for the fact that it cannot go everywhere with you. It\u2019s such a crazy notion that they should. It\u2019s not that simple but again, if you can\u2019t afford all of an animal\u2019s expenses, you just can\u2019t.", "it\u2019s not just a pool party, it\u2019s an event. and it\u2019s no different than hiring a baby sitter for a few hours when sitters can charge $20/hour", "[removed]", "Absolutely!

If you grade the brother an AH, OP is the larger AH \nsignificantly.\n\nThe brother lobbied against a rule that would hinder his ability to attended. Then the OP guilt tripped upon brother stating this prevents me from attending. Then OP was publicly angry about the brother decision.", "But the thing is, is even in OP\u2019s retelling, it\u2019s only YTA or ESH, because OP in their own words lays a guilt trip and is publicly mad at them.", "There's a difference between bringing a dog to an event and leaving a dog alone with a baby, though. I'm not saying that OP should let his brother bring the dog, but I've brought my dog to events where I've kept him on-leash with me the entire time to make sure I was monitoring him, and a situation like that is very different to leaving the dog alone with the baby.", "Yeah you never know, if the kid grabs a tail/ear or pokes an eye and the dog reacts. Or the dog thinks there is  food. Or the door bell goes and the dog runs over the child. And we had to watch the cats in case they jumped in the cot and lay on them. Or got freaked out and scratched them.\nThe cool thing is, both my kids love animals now, they are very relaxed around them, and are very respectful (always ask the owners before stroking them.) And are very helpful with feeding/walking them.", "Someone telling you your pet isn't welcome is frustrating. Especially if it was welcome before.", "Animals aren't known for being able to hold their bladders for very long", "Absolutely agree. Most of the time if the dog has anxiety, it\u2019s because the owner has not bothered to train the pup properly or are just not setting them up for success. So many people leave their dogs with nothing to occupy them, no chew toys, nothing. Which is inevitably followed by surprised pikachu face when Fido has chewed up the sofa. \n\nLike don\u2019t get me wrong, some dogs have genuine separation anxiety and some breeds are more prone than others. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019re debating that. \n\nYou\u2019re getting downvoted because people don\u2019t like engaging with the idea that their dog is only behaving a certain way because they haven\u2019t put the work in.", "My garage easily gets up to 90 degrees or more during the day. That\u2019s really hot when you\u2019re wearing fur. Maybe if your garage was completely shaded.

Lol", "The general consensus here is OP is more than allowed to not have the dog at his house as its his decision\n\nTrying to interject hyperbole about \u201cdog attacks\u201d is pointless. Life is unpredictable and dangerous including to but not limited to dogs.", "OP is the Brother.\n\nYeah, in my stand alone judgment, I actually voted for ESH because of the brothers\u2019 reactions.\n\nVisiting brother was over the top in his response. He could just say he\u2019s not coming because of the time and expense. \n\nWhile OP is mad that his brother doesn\u2019t want to spend a few hundred dollars to meet his kid.", "I can understand getting pissed at the rules suddenly changing. You also can't be mad at someone who doesn't want to come over because you changed your rules.", "It's funny because I hear this all the time on reddit but it's not being downvoted.  If it wasn't dogs vs. babies I bet yours wouldn't be either.", "Yeah, living by the \u201cwhat ifs\u201d in your life is an overreaction.

Dogs rarely attack children. It does happen, not saying it doesn\u2019t, but the way you are making it sound, as if they are deliberately charging at your child\u2026all the time. It\u2019s unusual that all these owners in your own family are taking the dog\u2019s side.", "Yeah I agree that he should understand that creating this rule (while IMO 100% justified) means his bro might not have been able to come. Being mad about that did rub me the wrong way. \n\nAt the same time I do understand that OP was hurt seeing how his brother didn\u2019t make it about not being ABLE to come due to having to leave the dog alone \u2014 it sounds to me like his brother made it clear that he COULD come but chose not to out of anger. The \u201con principle because you changed the rules\u201d attitude would have upset me as well. Comes off as very entitled for OPs brother to be angry and lash out like that.\n\nOP definitely needs to get used to the idea that his brother having to leave the dog home might mean he visits less due to logistics. He\u2019s still allowed to be hurt that it sounds like his brother prioritized anger over meeting his new nephew.", "What's there to not accept? Not like he can simply force his brother to come.", "Except his brother didn't just not go, he made a show about it.

This is a NAH situation imo. OP doesn\u2019t want dogs at his house, that\u2019s fine. Brother doesn\u2019t want to drive 8 hours round trip to see a baby bc he\u2019d have to hire someone to watch his dog, also fine. They both got grumpy about it, which is shitty, but since they both did it imo it cancels out", "I think you misinterpreted my comment.

Depending on what was actually said, it could go either way. I got the feeling OP is pretty upset that his brother won't go out of his way to meet the baby, so who knows what his tone was, or if the brother had to take a day off work for this get together and was told the day of or something.
