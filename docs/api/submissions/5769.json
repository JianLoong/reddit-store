I (F22) had a reunion with my friends from elementary school, they are basically my sisters and we\u2019ve known each other since we were like 7yo. So in this little gathering with the four of us, we planned it to be like a \u201cChristmas dinner\u201d. We all agreed to bring something for the dinner, like a dish, desert, anything related to that. One of my friends asked me if she could bring some tequila and beers. Which I didn\u2019t see a problem with, i was rooting for wine since I think fits more but I let her do it.\n\nFast forward to the dinner, we all are having a great time and it\u2019s time for exchanging the gifts. One of my friends \u201cJane\u201d suggested we should guess what\u2019s the gift and every time we fail we get a shot. We all agreed and we started playing. Everything\u2019s cool, but I noticed Jane is drinking more than the shots. Really didn\u2019t care at first, but after a while I notice every time she pours more into her drink. I approach her and asked if everything was cool, and told me that she wanted to get drunk. Which I just reminded her that we are just chilling right now, no need for that. \n\nBeing honest I do mind when people get drunk, it\u2019s funny to see them at first but if you\u2019re friend of the drunk, you have to take care of them. And I really hate that since drunks can be very difficult to manage. Well, she wasn\u2019t difficult but she was annoying. Like out of nowhere told us what she hates about us, started speaking in French, wanted to go out of my house, that kind of stuff. And since we had to take care of her, we couldn\u2019t do other stuff we had planned. \n\nThe next morning I asked her why she wanted to get drunk so badly. She confessed it was something she has been wanting to do for a long time. To get drunk with us (meaning she would be the drunk one and not us with her). Since we are her safe place and she knows nothing would happened. I was kinda mad at the moment and told her that what she did was selfish, and that I didn\u2019t sign up to be a nanny of a drunk.

It was good that you told her.  You drew a boundary.

Not in that order, necessarily.", "Harsh word, but what she did was harsh on you.. INFO: Did you all feel uncomfortable with her being selfish and getting drunk? How bad was your evening overall?\n\nNTA, because nobody should have to take care of a drunk person without agreeing beforehand that you will be there for them..

Just getting hammered and screwing all the fun for you was the T A move", "NTA she knew what the night was supposed to be and intentionally got drunk expecting to be looked after without consideration to you or the others", "NTA but did she black out? It's possible she doesn't even remember what she did.", "I will go NAH, Jane got drunk and kinda messed up the evening because she is confident of you and wanted to have a good time. She fucked up? Yes. She mean to? No. And you are clearly NTA", "Info:\n\n>She confessed it was something she has been wanting to do for a long time. To get drunk with us (meaning she would be the drunk one and not us with her).\n\nWere you usually the drunk annoying one and she had to take care of you?", "NTA. I don't know why people think others should be fine with suddenly having to take care of another adult because they decided to drink too much. It was selfish. You had a right to be upset.", "ESH for thinking you have to take care of drunk people", "she made the choice to drink and get drunk, but i don\u2019t think she realised how poorly she holds her liquor and/or that other people know how to not drink to excess. injecting alcohol into social events unnecessarily/\u201cseeking excuses\u201d is a pretty common sign of alcohol abuse issues", "So overall the experience was 5/10. We really had a great time before Jane got drunk, and while she was drunk as I said, she was being annoying.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I wonder if I am exaggerating, since one of my friends thinks Jane just took more drinks that\u2019s night and didn\u2019t see a problem with it, while the other one agrees with me.", "This, your friends were actually there and are better placed to judge.", "Exactly, OP has her friends to be able to sort out the situation..", "The opinions are divided half and half. One of them thinks it was not a big deal and the other agrees with me.", "What do **you** do with drunk people? Kick them out the door and congratulate yourself on getting rid of the problem? \n\nAnnoying as they are, drunk people are also very vulnerable. If this group had put her out and told her to make her own way home, there is a good chance Jane could have hurt herself (eg fallen over), gotten lost, have her wallet/phone stolen, be assaulted, pass out and choke on her vomit or a combination of the above. She could wake up in a police cell or hospital bed.", "When you meet next time, have a short conversation (all 4 girls) about it and ask what was the purpose of her getting so drunk to the point to tell you all what she hates about you and other issues she had.. \n\nBut honestly, I would just limit my contact with her and/or if you have another dinner and she wants to bring alcohol, just refuse and say you had the experience once, you hated it and you want to enjoy your evening..", "Welp... then I don't know what to tell ya... \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\nIf she wasn't throwing up, then I'm not sure what \"taking care of\" you had to do... \n\nMaybe you just didn't like her personality when she got drunk? That's a whole different issue...", "No it\u2019s about worrying too much about someone ruining a night by being drunk and making something bad happen that they are willing to ruin the fun for everybody including themselves. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have to babysit anybody and if she\u2019s really her friend she wouldn\u2019t have a problem with taking care of her", "The girl *intentionally* got drunk at OP's place as she was expecting to be looked after, not caring what the others want", "Nta. I get why the experience sucked, no one wants to babysit a drunk. Her views of you & your friends while drunk may be reflective of her own insecurities or her true feelings just said aloud. I'm more concerned for her binge drinking & the fact she said she needed a safe space. It's a sign something is not right with your friend. Have a talk with her, I'm telling you there is something triggering her.", "My ex boyfriend was a major alcoholic and when he was on one of his benders I would be catering to him and taking care of him.

This behaviour is indicative of alcohol abuse.", "NTA. Sometimes you should just be there for your friend, but since she did so intentionally it's a major yikes.", "NTA. She got drunk at your party without asking any of you for your consent. And she clearly planned it in advance.", "NTA, the friend wanted to try out getting drunk in a safe space and that's a reasonable thing.  For her to Shanghai you and your friends into unknowingly was not.  She should have just asked.  Some friends will do that for you.", "NTA. It sounds like Jane has a drinking problem though.", "NTA--- So she had a goal of being sloppy drunk and let her be other peoples problem? She sounds a bit selfish.", "What did you have to do to take care of her and what other stuff was planned? It's not unreasonable to want to get drunk with friends, especially if you're playing drinking games. \n\nHowever, you can have fun and get drunk without being a burden. Sounds like she overdid it.", "YTA. She wanted to drink, she did. Sounds like you had a problem with it before she even got drunk, so of course there's an issue to you.", "NTA. She admitted she intentionally got drunk with the plan that you would look after her. Next time, she can ask first (and you can say no if you want)."]}
