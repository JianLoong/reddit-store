Over time she has gotten very irresponsible. It\u2019s so frustrating because she used to do really well in school. Got A\u2019s and a few B\u2019s. But once she reached high school she gradually became lazier and her grades started to slip a little as a result. Despite of this, she graduated with a relatively good GPA though.\n\nBut college has been a different story. She\u2019s barely passing because she never attends class. She never wakes up for school in time and my husband or I have to drag her out of bed like she\u2019s a toddler. All she ever did was go on her phone until my husband confiscated it and told her she couldn\u2019t have it back until she studied more. But this didn\u2019t work either and she\u2019s now resorted to just lying in her bed all day. She never helps around the house either and she had also quit her well-paying job unbeknownst to me. No matter how hard we try she just refuses to do anything. Her finals are coming up soon and I\u2019m not sure if she gonna pass any of her exams. It\u2019s so irritating cause I know she\u2019s a smart kiddo but she doesn\u2019t want to put in any work to succeed.\n\nMy husband and I sat down with her the other day and spoke about her behavior. I told her she\u2019s not a baby anymore, she\u2019s in college now and she needs to grow up. With her current attitude about her education she\u2019ll never go anywhere. After going around in circles she told us to go f ourselves and went back up to her bedroom.\n\nthrowaway account", "created_utc": 1682128894, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12uqxv0/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_shes_not_a_baby/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was horrifically depressed and extremely stressed out about my classes. \n\nIt ended with me in the psych ward.

But right - she's just lazy and being a baby. Jesus Christ, lady... you sound like you totally lack empathy. Maybe get off your butt and start doing some research and maybe even (gasp!) reach out to a mental health professional to ask their advice. Shame on you.", "YTA.  For one, it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s showing symptoms of depression or mental health issues. As her mother you should be looking out for her health and well-being\u2026. And college is not the only path in life. I\u2019m 28, never went to college, and have owned my own incredibly successful business for three years now doing something that I love. I remember my high school guidance counselor telling me the same thing, \u201cyou\u2019ll never make anything of yourself if you don\u2019t go to college?\u201d And as a result, he never felt like a safe person  for me to go to, and I look back on him now all the time thinking about how I proved him wrong.", "You may not be familiar with the signs of depression, but to those of us who are intimately familiar with it, this screams that she is suffering from serious Depression. \n\nPlease have her see a mental health professional as soon as possible. \n\nAll to often, depression can lead to self-harm and suicidal thoughts. Please don\u2019t risk it.", "How anyone can see this behavior and not immediately think depression or some other mental health issue is beyond me. YTA", "YTA she's clearly showing symptoms of depression and you call her lazy instead of actually trying to adress her mental health.", "YTA but mostly due to how you reacted-instead of asking if she was okay, if she was *feeling* okay you resorted to grades. As someone who's been on the verge of some not great things due to my parents often acting as you have here: you *only* discuss her performance in school, rather than if anything has changed mentally.\n\nAsk her if she's stressed, the answer's likely yes. Offer the option of going to therapy, offer your support instead of degrading her. Stress like that is debilitating and dangerous, so please for her sake don't focus on grades and focus on helping her first and foremost. Grades are important but so is she.", "She is very clearly depressed, not lazy.\n\nYTA mate.", "NTA - There might be something else going on here. A sudden change in behaviour could be caused by some mental health issues. \n\nAlthough I will point out you are treating her like a child also. You confiscated an adult's phone.", "This sounds like depression. Have you asked her how she was feeling emotionally? If you approach this with a purely punitive attitude, she's not going to tell you anything.", "YTA people who are doing okay mentally do not act like this. Please try to get your daughter a therapist. Ask about how shes feeling and really listen. This is serious, a lot more serious than any grade of test could ever be.", "Uh this sounds like depression to me, have you even considered that? YTA for not asking her if there\u2019s anything wrong or if she\u2019s okay.", "YTA she\u2019s clearly depressed", "If you haven't yet - and don't plan to - get your daughter help with potential depression / metal health issues - then YTA.  Like others have posted, that's my first thought - and my primary concern.\n\nBut if/once you've ruled out serious mental issues, then some \"though love\" and \"motivation\" might be worth while.  In which case, NTA. \n\nOur teenager is a few years away, but our intention is that our child is either actively in school learning and/or is actively working. There is no long-term option where they don't do either (without physical or mental reasons). And in the short run, they'll be expected to \"earn their keep\". Maybe that starts with having to do their own laundry, cook their own food, take on increasing chores (cleaning, lawncare, etc.), and eventually have to pay \"rent\" and their portion of utilities/etc.  The point being to get them to understand that they need to do SOMETHING to provide for themselves, not just freeload off their parents their whole lives.\n\nHaving said that, recognize this is a balancing act. If you push to far too fast, you risk creating (or exasperating) a mental health issue. If you are too demanding or too controlling, you might get an overreaction where they \"flee\" home and potentially put themselves into harms way just to get away. And if you aren't determined enough, they can call your bluff...\n\nLastly, recognize this can be a really tough time for kids. At least it was for me...  I felt \"lost\", I didn't like the courses I was taking in college, didn't really understand how they'd help me going forward. I \"wasted\" a lot of time in college, got poor grades, skipped a lot of classes. Luckily I was attending college away from home, so I didn't have my parents trying to micromanage me (that would have gone poorly), but I was also forced to deal with \"grown up\" life - like I needed to work to have money to eat or go out and do things (before when we didn't live our life on the internet). I eventually found my path. Make sure your daughter knows that it's OK to feel lost, to be unsure of the path forward, and it's completely OK if the path changes many times before she figures out what's right for her.  But working through that path - one step at a time if needed - is the only way forward.  You just gotta do the work...", "Nah. Your concern and frustration is valid, but your approach is not working. See if you can help her get some mental health support. Sounds like depression or perhaps PTSD related to something traumatic that happened that she won\u2019t share. Just speculation, but something is going on, and you can\u2019t yell or tough love her through this.", "Yta- sounds like she's depressed.", "She seems depressed. Hopefully she will accept help", "Depressed about having to grow up and work, be responsible, stop having someone else pay the bills? Seems so many young women and men are depressed today and clinging to their parents homes and the lifestyle their parents money buys them while they they cry about how mean those parents are. NTA", "Depression?\nRecent trauma?\n\nA lot of bad things can happen to a person at that age.", "NTA\nLike others have said, it does sound like depression.  Did any of her HS friends end up in the same college with her?  Her whole life have changed from HS to college, that can be really rough for some people.  Can you afford a therapist?  Does the college have free therapy for their students?", "NTA but you need to stop and think about what happened to cause the slide.  To be honest it sounds like she might be clinically depressed.  You might see if you can get her to see a shrink.", "NAH. I\u2019m a Mom with a 19 year old college student daughter. We\u2019ve had so many of the same problems that you listed. Here is what we did: She has been evaluated by her GYN and her regular doctor and a mental health counselor. We wanted to make sure this wasn\u2019t depression or anxiety or something worse. After all of that and paying for a once a week tutor, we had to cut off some money, concerts, and/or privileges. We discussed in detail how to earn these things back and there were no tears. Everything is looking up. I\u2019m optimistic about the end of this semester. She\u2019s been studying hard. \n\nGood luck!", "NAH.  That sounds like it could be mental health related rather than just laziness.  Sounds like significant depression.  I think she needs to be seen by a professional.   Good luck.", "Clearly your daughter doesn't know why she's in college. She lacks direction and motivation. Perhaps she is in college because it was expected and she just went along with the program, but doesn't have an actual post-college plan. I say this because this was me 100%. So, talk to her about leaving college, and getting a job. Perhaps after working a bit, she'll figure out what she wants from life and will be more focused. She may or may not return to college. Maybe she'll do a trade school.\n\nEdit to add--give ultimatum that it is a full time job or buckle down in college otherwise she needs to move out. And if she is working full time, she should pay some rent (you can keep it in an account and give it back to her someday if you want, but she needs to learn responsibility)", "NTA. Is there a chance she\u2019s suffering with her mental health? Depressed? Kind of sounds like it.", "NTA!!\n\nYour job is to make sure she does succeed. You\u2019re doing exactly what a parent should do. \n\nHowever, since she recently quit her job and she\u2019s sleeping a lot, I almost wonder if she\u2019s depressed.
