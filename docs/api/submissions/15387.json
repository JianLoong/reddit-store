She never wakes up for school in time and my husband or I have to drag her out of bed like she\u2019s a toddler. All she ever did was go on her phone until my husband confiscated it and told her she couldn\u2019t have it back until she studied more. But this didn\u2019t work either and she\u2019s now resorted to just lying in her bed all day. She never helps around the house either and she had also quit her well-paying job unbeknownst to me. No matter how hard we try she just refuses to do anything. Her finals are coming up soon and I\u2019m not sure if she gonna pass any of her exams. It\u2019s so irritating cause I know she\u2019s a smart kiddo but she doesn\u2019t want to put in any work to succeed.\n\nMy husband and I sat down with her the other day and spoke about her behavior.

Like others have posted, that's my first thought - and my primary concern.\n\nBut if/once you've ruled out serious mental issues, then some \"though love\" and \"motivation\" might be worth while.  In which case, NTA. \n\nOur teenager is a few years away, but our intention is that our child is either actively in school learning and/or is actively working. There is no long-term option where they don't do either (without physical or mental reasons). And in the short run, they'll be expected to \"earn their keep\". Maybe that starts with having to do their own laundry, cook their own food, take on increasing chores (cleaning, lawncare, etc.), and eventually have to pay \"rent\" and their portion of utilities/etc.  The point being to get them to understand that they need to do SOMETHING to provide for themselves, not just freeload off their parents their whole lives.\n\nHaving said that, recognize this is a balancing act. If you push to far too fast, you risk creating (or exasperating) a mental health issue. If you are too demanding or too controlling, you might get an overreaction where they \"flee\" home and potentially put themselves into harms way just to get away. And if you aren't determined enough, they can call your bluff...\n\nLastly, recognize this can be a really tough time for kids. At least it was for me...  I felt \"lost\", I didn't like the courses I was taking in college, didn't really understand how they'd help me going forward. I \"wasted\" a lot of time in college, got poor grades, skipped a lot of classes. Luckily I was attending college away from home, so I didn't have my parents trying to micromanage me (that would have gone poorly), but I was also forced to deal with \"grown up\" life - like I needed to work to have money to eat or go out and do things (before when we didn't live our life on the internet). I eventually found my path. Make sure your daughter knows that it's OK to feel lost, to be unsure of the path forward, and it's completely OK if the path changes many times before she figures out what's right for her.  But working through that path - one step at a time if needed - is the only way forward.  You just gotta do the work...", "Nah. Your concern and frustration is valid, but your approach is not working. See if you can help her get some mental health support. Sounds like depression or perhaps PTSD related to something traumatic that happened that she won\u2019t share.

Hopefully she will accept help", "Depressed about having to grow up and work, be responsible, stop having someone else pay the bills?

Did any of her HS friends end up in the same college with her?  Her whole life have changed from HS to college, that can be really rough for some people.  Can you afford a therapist?

You might see if you can get her to see a shrink.", "NAH. I\u2019m a Mom with a 19 year old college student daughter. We\u2019ve had so many of the same problems that you listed. Here is what we did: She has been evaluated by her GYN and her regular doctor and a mental health counselor. We wanted to make sure this wasn\u2019t depression or anxiety or something worse. After all of that and paying for a once a week tutor, we had to cut off some money, concerts, and/or privileges. We discussed in detail how to earn these things back and there were no tears. Everything is looking up. I\u2019m optimistic about the end of this semester. She\u2019s been studying hard. \n\nGood luck!", "NAH.  That sounds like it could be mental health related rather than just laziness.  Sounds like significant depression.  I think she needs to be seen by a professional.

Perhaps she is in college because it was expected and she just went along with the program, but doesn't have an actual post-college plan. I say this because this was me 100%. So, talk to her about leaving college, and getting a job. Perhaps after working a bit, she'll figure out what she wants from life and will be more focused. She may or may not return to college. Maybe she'll do a trade school.\n\nEdit to add--give ultimatum that it is a full time job or buckle down in college otherwise she needs to move out.

I'm better now, but god damn it would have been nice to have support from my family instead of them berating me for \"ruining my life\"", "same story here. one night i couldn\u2019t take the pressure anymore so i took all of my medications at once and ended up in the ICU, then the psych ward. i was diagnosed with bipolar, anxiety, and depression after the episode. turned out they missed one though because years later i was also diagnosed with adhd, and it was that diagnosis that really started to change my life. docs said i was lucky to walk away from my suicide attempt with no liver or brain damage. i went back to try college again 7 years later, i\u2019m a junior now. it\u2019s been a long and unnecessary road. \n\nOP, please empathize with your daughter and help her seek help", "Yeah, I\u2019ve just recently finally gotten diagnosed with OCD and MDD (and I have a feeling there\u2019s probably something more going on that hasn\u2019t been addressed yet) and I\u2019m not currently getting any sort of therapy treatment for it. And I\u2019m nearly failing out of the two (only two!) classes I\u2019m still taking this semester as a result. It\u2019s definitely not the phone, it\u2019s something seriously wrong with her.

This kid needs help, not censure.", "Mine was a double whammy of undiagnosed ADHD and undiagnosed PTSD.

Suddenly everyone is a therapist/doctor and knows 100% that this is caused by depression. She might have a mental illness or she might not, we don't know, but I don't think you're the ah for being frustrated with her. I do think your approach is wrong as you are treating her like a child (like taking away her phone). Perhaps it's good to have a conversation with her and try to understand why she is acting this way, maybe try to get her to see a doctor or therapist, but in the end she is an adult so it's her choice.

Just to be clear too, me saying anything about therapy is in no way an attack on anyone, I think therapy is amazing and helpful and I think every person on the planet could benefit from finding the right therapist who works for them.", "YTA because you are measuring her to your expectations and are not interested in whats going on with her. Your approach lacked empathy. Your daughter  obviously understands pretty well that she is has problems. She does not need yet another one telling her what she already knows. She needs help and that's what you should provide: A safe person to open up to, not judging, but trying to understand and offering solutions. By telling her that she won't \"get anywhere\" you probably made things worse because now she understands that you are focussed on outcome only and do not care about what happens to her in the process.

Wishing the best for your family", "YTA.", "YTA. \n\nI know it's hard to recognize the signs if it is not something you've experienced. But your child desperately needs to be screened for ADHD, depression, and other potential mental health disorders to see if there is an underlying issue here. Because it sure as heck sounds like it. \n\nYou are continuing to treat her like a young child instead of actually helping her gain independence and practice skills related to self-reliance. Hounding a 19 year old to get up on time isn't going to help her suddenly become responsible, and taking away their phone is just petty. \n\nWhat you SHOULD do is \n1) therapy and a psych screening. Really cannot stress this one enough. \n2) sit down and help her figure out what actually really motivates her, what she wants to do, and what she is reasonably capable of right now\n3) you can support and encourage her but you also need to be prepared to let her fail and to deal with consequences, like failing a course if she doesn't show up. She needs to figure out what she can do, and how to step back, how she can ask for help, how to drop a registration before it negatively effects her, etc. You can't do it all for her. \n\nIt's possible that regular university life isn't for her, or at least not right now, and that is okay. And YOU need to be okay with that, and let her know that you support whatever path she takes. \n\nCommunity College is a great option for a lower pressure and lower cost environment. A lot of students benefit from trying out different course topics there to figure out what they actually want to do, and then transfer to a 4 year university. Or, it's just a less competitive and lower pressure (but just as educationally valuable) way to get the basic/core curriculum out of the way.  Basically every CC has guidance on how their courses will transfer to 4 year universities in the state. If she doesn't want to transfer back to a 4 year, she can still walk away with some new knowledge or possible even an associate's degree. And, this may be easier to manage if she wants to try college on a part time schedule so she can adjust more gradually. \nVocational schools/trade schools are also fantastic alternatives, and a lot of those jobs are in high demand and extremely lucrative.", "Psychologist", "So.... your daughter is incredibly depressed, it's getting worse, and you're not gonna do anything about it?

Let me get this straight, up until recently your daughter was working and then trying to study full-time? This is really hard and a recipe for burn out. Regarding her behaviour it is your daughter's choice what to do with her life as hard as that may be to accept. Your actions confiscating an adult's phone show that you are quite controlling already.

I did great, worked hard, and understood near everything. Then I moved out to go to college in a different country. At first, it was OK, but over the four years, I started to lose headway. I started to not feel emotions. I couldn't keep up with the work. It was scary. I didn\u2019t understand why I was forgetting assignments, why I couldn't get up in time for class. It felt like I had weights tied to my legs as I pushed against the current of a river, and it tired me out. Then my cousin killed himself, and suddenly I was in bed for hours, spent a whole two weeks eating once every three days, doing nothing but wishing I didn't exist. My best friend broke me out of it by asking me to help her with something.\n\nI'm honestly surprised I managed to finish that last year. It was sheer stubbornness. I'm surprised I didn't make an attempt on my life.\n\nAnd throughout this, I didn\u2019t tell my parents. I was terrified of disappointing them, the first of two \"genius\" children. I was worried they would tell me off. I was scared I wasn't good enough.\n\nAfter I graduated and went back home, my parents were furious with me. They did what you are doing: give me talks about laziness, try to get me to do more, threatened to take away my computer. I understand now they were desperate and worried, but to me, it just confirmed what I had feared: I was a waste of resources time and space. I thought I was a parasite. My loving family had become someone I tried to avoid so I would stop hurting them. But I was also angry when the thick fog of not feeling lifted because my support had let me down. It still hurts, ten years after the fact.\n\nEventually I was taken to therapy. I got diagnosed with depression, got medication, my parents did research and changed their approach after that. I improved. I started working, part time jobs, or temporary contracts in a field related to mine. I started to gain my confidence and functionality back.\n\nMy parents regret to this day how they treated me. They have since then learned what helps me. They pester me, yes, but it's without judgment now. They understand that I carry a burden on me that makes things harder. I then got an ADD diagnosis, and it's made me understand that I'm not useless.\n\nI am now graduating with a Masters degree this semester. I still am depressed, not as strongly as before, but there are still days I can't get up out of bed, I will probably face this hardship my entire life. If my parents hadn't changed how they acted, I would not still be alive.\n\nShe's depressed or something. Something is wrong. Sit down with her, apologize for your previous behavior, and ask her how you can help well. Ask her why she is struggling. Apologize again. You're going to have to rebuild trust slowly. Tell her you think family therapy might help you all understand each other and what's going on. Hopefully, she'll accept the help. Hopefully, from there, she will accept transitioning to personal therapy and a diagnosis. Be careful, and treat her with love.\n\nOnly then, slowly, will you see a change. Because it's not going to be immediate. Help her talk to the Dean to give her mental health resources and the option to leave university for now. Invest time in helping her remember what she enjoys doing. Make her food she likes. Support her starting small. Research depression and strategies for change. Talk with a therapist about how you can help.\n\nI wish you luck in helping your daughter.", "I had the same, due to major depression and autism diagnosis.

There is something very wrong here and instead of trying to help and support her you\u2019re punishing her.My own teenage child is very sick with anxiety and depression and my main regret is it took so long to realise. The fact he was too ill to go to school but instantly better when we pick him up or allow him to stay home. We thought he was skiving and he himself didn\u2019t know what was going on. After a while he was able to explain that he was sick with headaches stomach pain feeling sick pounding heart and then it would just go when we kept him home. We realised then it was more and he was actually suffering from a sickness.That\u2019s how anxiety works you feel and really struggle but the minute you don\u2019t have to do or face what triggered you it disappears.

Your daughter is 19. This would mean that she\u2019s likely a freshman in college? And you say her behavior issues started in high school? \n\nHuh, wonder what world-wide event could have caused some complete behavior shifts in a high school student about 3-4 years ago? /s \n\nIt\u2019s not likely to be understood by someone that wasn\u2019t a student or teacher during that time frame, but Covid REALLY messed up the education system for a lot of people. The social anxiety ramped up, the uncertainties were more numerous than the certainties, and yet everyone pretended we just needed to get back to normal in schools. But nothing was normal. And the fallout from that will not be understood for decades. But as the 2020-21 school year was my last in-person year of teaching, I can definitely speak from experience that things were bad and kids are questioning the usefulness of education anyways. Enrollment numbers at universities are down and haven\u2019t really had the bounce back they expected after Covid. \n\nSo as others have suggested, maybe instead of forcing your child to go to college, you should be asking the right questions and getting her the help she does actually need to get to the core issue of why does her bed seem like the better place to be all day?

But let me also tell you a little story. \n\nWhen I was a kid I was a straight A student. Never got a grade below a B, but by the time I hit high school I got REALLY depressed. I started not caring about school and all I wanted to do was sleep, because if I was asleep I didn\u2019t feel like I was drowning anymore. My mom never helped me, she wanted her \u201cperfect child\u201d back and constantly reminded me of that, and if I was depressed then I CERTAINLY wasn\u2019t perfect. I\u2019m now in my early 20\u2019s and I don\u2019t talk to my mom anymore. I completely cut her out of my life because the amount of pressure she put on me to be perfect was too much of a strain on my mental health (amongst other things she did). \n\nAll of that to say: HELP YOUR KID. Instead of accusing her of being lazy, ask her WHY her grades are slipping. Ask her if she\u2019s been feeling okay. Ask if there\u2019s anything you can do to help. Ask if she needs to talk to a professional.
