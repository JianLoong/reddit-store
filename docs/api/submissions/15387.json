Over time she has gotten very irresponsible. It\u2019s so frustrating because she used to do really well in school. Got A\u2019s and a few B\u2019s. But once she reached high school she gradually became lazier and her grades started to slip a little as a result. Despite of this, she graduated with a relatively good GPA though.\n\nBut college has been a different story. She\u2019s barely passing because she never attends class. She never wakes up for school in time and my husband or I have to drag her out of bed like she\u2019s a toddler. All she ever did was go on her phone until my husband confiscated it and told her she couldn\u2019t have it back until she studied more. But this didn\u2019t work either and she\u2019s now resorted to just lying in her bed all day. She never helps around the house either and she had also quit her well-paying job unbeknownst to me. No matter how hard we try she just refuses to do anything. Her finals are coming up soon and I\u2019m not sure if she gonna pass any of her exams. It\u2019s so irritating cause I know she\u2019s a smart kiddo but she doesn\u2019t want to put in any work to succeed.\n\nMy husband and I sat down with her the other day and spoke about her behavior. I told her she\u2019s not a baby anymore, she\u2019s in college now and she needs to grow up. With her current attitude about her education she\u2019ll never go anywhere.

Like others have posted, that's my first thought - and my primary concern.\n\nBut if/once you've ruled out serious mental issues, then some \"though love\" and \"motivation\" might be worth while.  In which case, NTA. \n\nOur teenager is a few years away, but our intention is that our child is either actively in school learning and/or is actively working. There is no long-term option where they don't do either (without physical or mental reasons). And in the short run, they'll be expected to \"earn their keep\". Maybe that starts with having to do their own laundry, cook their own food, take on increasing chores (cleaning, lawncare, etc.), and eventually have to pay \"rent\" and their portion of utilities/etc.  The point being to get them to understand that they need to do SOMETHING to provide for themselves, not just freeload off their parents their whole lives.\n\nHaving said that, recognize this is a balancing act. If you push to far too fast, you risk creating (or exasperating) a mental health issue. If you are too demanding or too controlling, you might get an overreaction where they \"flee\" home and potentially put themselves into harms way just to get away. And if you aren't determined enough, they can call your bluff...\n\nLastly, recognize this can be a really tough time for kids. At least it was for me...  I felt \"lost\", I didn't like the courses I was taking in college, didn't really understand how they'd help me going forward. I \"wasted\" a lot of time in college, got poor grades, skipped a lot of classes. Luckily I was attending college away from home, so I didn't have my parents trying to micromanage me (that would have gone poorly), but I was also forced to deal with \"grown up\" life - like I needed to work to have money to eat or go out and do things (before when we didn't live our life on the internet). I eventually found my path. Make sure your daughter knows that it's OK to feel lost, to be unsure of the path forward, and it's completely OK if the path changes many times before she figures out what's right for her.  But working through that path - one step at a time if needed - is the only way forward.  You just gotta do the work...", "Nah. Your concern and frustration is valid, but your approach is not working. See if you can help her get some mental health support. Sounds like depression or perhaps PTSD related to something traumatic that happened that she won\u2019t share.

Hopefully she will accept help", "Depressed about having to grow up and work, be responsible, stop having someone else pay the bills?

Did any of her HS friends end up in the same college with her?  Her whole life have changed from HS to college, that can be really rough for some people.  Can you afford a therapist?

You might see if you can get her to see a shrink.", "NAH. I\u2019m a Mom with a 19 year old college student daughter. We\u2019ve had so many of the same problems that you listed. Here is what we did: She has been evaluated by her GYN and her regular doctor and a mental health counselor. We wanted to make sure this wasn\u2019t depression or anxiety or something worse. After all of that and paying for a once a week tutor, we had to cut off some money, concerts, and/or privileges. We discussed in detail how to earn these things back and there were no tears. Everything is looking up. I\u2019m optimistic about the end of this semester. She\u2019s been studying hard. \n\nGood luck!", "NAH.  That sounds like it could be mental health related rather than just laziness.  Sounds like significant depression.  I think she needs to be seen by a professional.

Perhaps she is in college because it was expected and she just went along with the program, but doesn't have an actual post-college plan. I say this because this was me 100%. So, talk to her about leaving college, and getting a job. Perhaps after working a bit, she'll figure out what she wants from life and will be more focused. She may or may not return to college. Maybe she'll do a trade school.\n\nEdit to add--give ultimatum that it is a full time job or buckle down in college otherwise she needs to move out.

I'm better now, but god damn it would have been nice to have support from my family instead of them berating me for \"ruining my life\"", "same story here. one night i couldn\u2019t take the pressure anymore so i took all of my medications at once and ended up in the ICU, then the psych ward. i was diagnosed with bipolar, anxiety, and depression after the episode. turned out they missed one though because years later i was also diagnosed with adhd, and it was that diagnosis that really started to change my life. docs said i was lucky to walk away from my suicide attempt with no liver or brain damage. i went back to try college again 7 years later, i\u2019m a junior now. it\u2019s been a long and unnecessary road. \n\nOP, please empathize with your daughter and help her seek help", "Yeah, I\u2019ve just recently finally gotten diagnosed with OCD and MDD (and I have a feeling there\u2019s probably something more going on that hasn\u2019t been addressed yet) and I\u2019m not currently getting any sort of therapy treatment for it. And I\u2019m nearly failing out of the two (only two!) classes I\u2019m still taking this semester as a result. It\u2019s definitely not the phone, it\u2019s something seriously wrong with her. No one throws away a college degree and a good job to lay in bed all day doing nothing because they\u2019re \u201ca baby\u201d\n\nYTA OP, please talk with your daughter and find a way to help her. Insults will only make things much worse.", "This is what I came here to say. She def needs to be screened for depression. Sit down and talk to her. She sounds like she is giving up on herself. I've self sabotaged like this a few times and it takes a lot to get out of the downward spiral.", "Also all these posts talking about depression\u2026..again that\u2019s something that she has to workout herself. Being told by someone \u201cyour depressed and need help\u201d will likely result in the exact opposite happening and the worsening of yalls relationship. \nShe\u2019s an adult. Treat her like one. Stop taking her phone and having \u201ctalks\u201d like she\u2019s 12.", "Yeah, the free-form nature of most college assignments will hit an undiagnosed ADHD gifted kid like a brick in the face. \n\nI also had a friend who had awful social anxiety crash at college too. \n\nIt's really when a lot of issues become impossible to ignore or work around. This kid needs help, not censure.", "Mine was a double whammy of undiagnosed ADHD and undiagnosed PTSD. My first semester of college nearly broke me, but my mom helped me figure out what I was feeling and what I needed to to do get back on track. Funnily enough, she never needed to resort to telling me I was acting like a baby or confiscating my belongings. \n\nYTA", "Same here!  I had to drop out of my animation major after two years because I had massive depression, untreated ADHD and a nervous breakdown.\n\nI still feel like a failure, and my folks did nothing to help that outlook.  I was also called lazy, unmotivated, a child, useless, ect.  I also had my things confiscated!\n\nMy parents and I dont talk now, and I live a good ways away, so that's your future.  If you dont want it to be, get your daughter professional help and treat her with more caring and empathy than my parents did to me.\n\nOh and give her back her goddamn phone.", "Same. Happened to both myself and my cousin. He flunked out of Oxford, I never passed my first degree program and my dad went to his grave never knowing (but probably suspecting).", "Yeah, sounds like you gave her one life line away and so instead of barely passing she\u2019s now given up.\n\nPlease talk to her about what she actually needs instead of acting like she\u2019s still 15.", "YTA. This screams depression, *especially*:\n\n>All she ever did was go on her phone until my husband confiscated it and told her she couldn\u2019t have it back until she studied more. But this didn\u2019t work either and she\u2019s now resorted to just lying in her bed all day. She never helps around the house either and she had also quit her well-paying job \n\nIf boredom does not motivate her to get up and get moving, *something* is clearly seriously wrong, and you and your husband are not helping matters. Seek advice from a therapist, ffs.", "Have you considered asking her if she's OKAY?? I don't know how much more obvious the depression needs to be. Not exaggerating this word for word is why a lot of teens start self harming.", "She sounds like me at 18-19...barely studied in my last year of high school cause I had low motivation and was depressed...just increased in the classes I found hard at uni in my first year. BTW uni is a big change from high school, took me a good while to adjust to the difference.", "She\u2019s just lazy. Make her contribute to bills and drop her out of school. Not worth dropping your money on if she\u2019s not even putting in the work", "You\u2019ve spoiled her and now it\u2019s time to kick her out and let her fend for herself. She\u2019s never going to grow up if you don\u2019t.", "NTA, you're only concerned about her, i had the same talk with my kids... 1 took my word's and advice carefully and is about graduate university and been put forward for a leadership course where only 2 people from the year are chosen. The other dropped out to find work as his mate's we're all earning money and having great fun, he's now 25 with 2 kids, is a shitty dead end job and struggling financially. \n I don't think like some here, it's not depression or ADHD, maybe she's not enjoying her subject's?. That can have a huge impact on how well they perform in class.", "NTA. Everyone in the comments is really annoying. Suddenly everyone is a therapist/doctor and knows 100% that this is caused by depression. She might have a mental illness or she might not, we don't know, but I don't think you're the ah for being frustrated with her. I do think your approach is wrong as you are treating her like a child (like taking away her phone). Perhaps it's good to have a conversation with her and try to understand why she is acting this way, maybe try to get her to see a doctor or therapist, but in the end she is an adult so it's her choice. If she doesn't want to go, you need to be more strict with her - either she helps around the house, find a job, go to theapy or she moves out. She's an adult.", "YTA - she is showing signs of depression, not laziness. Talk to her, maybe take a break next semester while she focuses on her mental health, help get her in therapy if she\u2019s willing.", "From your post it doesn't look like you've asked her if anything's up, just that you want her to straighten up. \n\nI get your frustration as she was doing so well, but have you tried to find out why there's been this change?", "YTA- it sounds like your daughter is dealing with depression which is normal for a lot of college students. Try some compassion and listening to her feelings instead of belittling her. Consider mentioning therapy for everyone, separately obviously but I\u2019m sure she could use it and I\u2019m sure it would help you and your husband as well. Just to be clear too, me saying anything about therapy is in no way an attack on anyone, I think therapy is amazing and helpful and I think every person on the planet could benefit from finding the right therapist who works for them.", "YTA because you are measuring her to your expectations and are not interested in whats going on with her. Your approach lacked empathy. Your daughter  obviously understands pretty well that she is has problems. She does not need yet another one telling her what she already knows. She needs help and that's what you should provide: A safe person to open up to, not judging, but trying to understand and offering solutions. By telling her that she won't \"get anywhere\" you probably made things worse because now she understands that you are focussed on outcome only and do not care about what happens to her in the process. Good luck with fixing that.", "YYA. Your daughter needs love, support, and help NOW. She\u2019s not \u201cbeing a baby,\u201d she\u2019s showing classic signs of depression.\n\nThat poor girl is already dealing with feelings of imposter syndrome, futility, and tanked self esteem and you didn\u2019t just kick her, you shot her while she was down right in her biggest insecurities.\n\nDo what\u2019s right by your daughter, apologize, and get her an appointment to see a psychiatrist (not a psychologist. She needs to see a medical doctor). Help her call her dean and explain the situation. This semester may be a wash, but mental health is important and keeping the dean in the loop can make future accommodations a lot easier to get.", "YTA\n\nAre y\u2019all parents even trying sometimes ? The kids can have the most fricking issues right in front of you and you be like ; \u201cMust be lazy\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s obviously depressed you asshole, who tf lies in bed all day without a reason, especially when she wasn\u2019t doing that, she\u2019s depressed try to have some empathy and try to ask if she wants help or something instead of just thinking she\u2019s a lazy asshole", "I was in this situation as the child. The reason this was happening was cuz I was extremely depressed. That said I had a similar thing on my 20s but it was entitlement. Luckily my mother got fed up and started charging me rent or she'd kick me out.\n\nEither way try to approach this with patience. Wishing the best for your family", "YTA.", "YTA. \n\nI know it's hard to recognize the signs if it is not something you've experienced. But your child desperately needs to be screened for ADHD, depression, and other potential mental health disorders to see if there is an underlying issue here. Because it sure as heck sounds like it. \n\nYou are continuing to treat her like a young child instead of actually helping her gain independence and practice skills related to self-reliance. Hounding a 19 year old to get up on time isn't going to help her suddenly become responsible, and taking away their phone is just petty. \n\nWhat you SHOULD do is \n1) therapy and a psych screening. Really cannot stress this one enough. \n2) sit down and help her figure out what actually really motivates her, what she wants to do, and what she is reasonably capable of right now\n3) you can support and encourage her but you also need to be prepared to let her fail and to deal with consequences, like failing a course if she doesn't show up. She needs to figure out what she can do, and how to step back, how she can ask for help, how to drop a registration before it negatively effects her, etc. You can't do it all for her. \n\nIt's possible that regular university life isn't for her, or at least not right now, and that is okay. And YOU need to be okay with that, and let her know that you support whatever path she takes. \n\nCommunity College is a great option for a lower pressure and lower cost environment. A lot of students benefit from trying out different course topics there to figure out what they actually want to do, and then transfer to a 4 year university. Or, it's just a less competitive and lower pressure (but just as educationally valuable) way to get the basic/core curriculum out of the way.  Basically every CC has guidance on how their courses will transfer to 4 year universities in the state. If she doesn't want to transfer back to a 4 year, she can still walk away with some new knowledge or possible even an associate's degree. And, this may be easier to manage if she wants to try college on a part time schedule so she can adjust more gradually. \nVocational schools/trade schools are also fantastic alternatives, and a lot of those jobs are in high demand and extremely lucrative.", "Psychologist", "So.... your daughter is incredibly depressed, it's getting worse, and you're not gonna do anything about it? I'm sure continuing to call her lazy and not provide any meaningful assistance for her is going to solve ALLLLLLLLLL your problems and work out exactly the way you want it to. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. Let me get this straight, up until recently your daughter was working and then trying to study full-time? This is really hard and a recipe for burn out. Regarding her behaviour it is your daughter's choice what to do with her life as hard as that may be to accept. Your actions confiscating an adult's phone show that you are quite controlling already. You are coming from a good place, but it is clear that she is struggling and staying in bed all day may be a sign that she is depressed. Try to help your daughter, telling her to get her act together will not help her.", "Sounds like something is very wrong with her. Please treat her with kindness and help her get through it.", "YTA\n\nright. i'm a psychology student, and what your daughter is showing maybe signs of depression or a similar mental illness. have some empathy towards your daughter and actually try to HELP her manage her shit instead of berating her about it. you don't know what's going on in her personal life. be a parent. \n\nand if you read this, please do not confront your daughter about depression. you'll only make things worse if she does have depression.", "Yeah, YTA. Open your eyes OP, something else is going on. You are missing the bare minimum level of empathy that you should be approaching your child with.\n\nGive her a hug and apologize for being a dick.", "This sounds alarmingly similar to my dropping point. I was a great student \\[I even got an award for my statewide test scores as a kid\\] until I began developing depression. I went from being a great student to a high school dropout within a few years. Talk to your daughter about her mental health instead of punishing her.", "Yeah, if you keep treating her like this you're either going to end up picking out a coffin or dropping her off at the psych ward, depending on the successfulness of her upcoming suicide attempt. Jesus christ. Get her some help you self absorbed assholes. YTA.", "YTA. The situation you are describing is my childhood and young adulthood to a T. I had undiagnosed ADHD and developed depression as a result. Years of being called lazy and irresponsible didn\u2019t magically turn me into a hard worker, it just gave me horrific self esteem and trust issues. You can\u2019t discipline her out of this. Show some fucking compassion and get your daughter the help she needs.", "YTA. i failed out of my first (and only) year of college and most people would\u2019ve just called me really lazy, but i was incredibly depressed, anxious, and borderline suicidal. your daughter is pretty obviously depressed, no healthy person lays in bed all day. maybe try some empathy for a change.", "Sounds like classic depression to me. Unfortunately it can\u2019t be fixed with shaming.", "YTA. She\u2019s severely depressed and you guys aren\u2019t helping. Dude, I was in her shoes before and I understand how she feels. There is no fast way of curing depression, it takes time and patience, but what won\u2019t help if neither you or your husband are supportive of her.", "I'm 35, in my second year of university, and your daughter sounds just like how I feel these days.\n\nI'm on sick leave, due to stress, and getting worked out for ADHD. I think you should concider talking to her in a real way, and getting her some help, in stead of shaming her for the things she may not be PHYSICALLY capable of right now.", "Yta. Your daughter is depressed and needs help.", "YTA\n\nHonestly I get your frustration but this big behaviour change screams depression or some other mental issue. It's nothing to be ashamed of or to try to ignore, it won't go away on it's own. She needs help and understanding, because it seems she is giving up for SOME reason.\nPlease try to get her help.", "Tricky\nIf she's depressed you need to find it out from her and fully support.\nIf she is just being lazy, explain that she will have to work much harder for the rest of her life and that she can't rely on you two to subsidise her.\n\nUltimately, you need to have that discussion but first step is to assume it's her mental health and do everything to encourage and find support.\n\nIs there depression in the family? That might give you some clues.\n\nThis is much more important than asking about who's the arsehole", "Jesus you can't be this blind and out of touch. In just 3 paragraphs strangers can deduce that your daughters deeply depressed but you, her parent that lives with her can't see that?

I had depression and anxiety through high school and college and never pulled this stuff. Absolutely some empathy could have been shown, but communication is a two way street. Expectations are a simple part of life. People fall back on the mental health excuse too often. So many people around this country and world function unmedicated with depression. It sucks. I know. Personally. However, quitting your job and telling the people who house you to f-off when they approach you about growing up isn\u2019t acceptable. \n\nI lived with this person. This was my sister. She had issues, but our parents went out of their way to help her. Instead, she made all of our lives miserable. I suffer anxiety and depression just as she did. I have a career and successful relationships with friends and family. Mental illness is not an automatic allowance for bad behavior. By the way, if y\u2019all think \u201ckids\u201d don\u2019t fake depressed, you\u2019re fooling yourselves. I work with teenagers ten out of twelve months. They absolutely do.

This is so wrong on many levels. You both need to be with her more.

Didn't help when my younger sister was diagnosed with depression and I was considered as being jealous. I spent working my ass off till ned school and then just gave up.

Learn some empathy", "My anxiety \"full-bloomed\" in college. Classes became \"impossible tasks\". I barely scraped by. The social aspect of college life was so much more intriguing to me. I had a really minimal social life in high school, but once I hit college, there were SO MANY interesting people. Academics fell to the wayside. OPs daughter may just need time to \"find herself\".
