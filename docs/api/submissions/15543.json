The crime and the punishment were simultaneous.  Good job!\n\nHowever, be careful not to call it a trap.  Avoid liability!  You did this to stabilize and strengthen the pumpkin.  Right?", "NTA but you only filled it with concrete so it would stay in place, right? You certainly didn\u2019t try to hurt anyone, of course not, no sirree, not a chance officer.", "Hello. NTA, but as your friendly lurking lawyer, I strongly advise you to delete this post, just in case, hahaha. Even your username cracked me up.", "NTA. It\u2019s your property and he only came over to damage it. It\u2019s not your fault he got hurt when he decided to damage personal property.", "NTA. Well played.", "NTA. As long as the pumpkin was inside your property boundaries, it was him who trespassed and damaged your property. The mom is just pissed her precious pumpkin had a broken toe.", "NTA - kid did it to himself. So what if I like to fill my pumpkins with concrete? That's my own business.", "NTA. Actions have consequences", "Kid played a stupid game & won a stupid prize. If my kid came home & told me that's what happened, I would chew his dumb ass out and still make him apologize to the homeowner! NTA.", "NTA and rather funny, but I have a somewhat twisted sense of humor.\n\nHowever, it's pretty much illegal everywhere to booby-trap your property with the expectation of causing harm.  I'd personally delete the post.", "NTA. I love it! I can\u2019t believe that mom had the nerve to knock on your door to tell you that her a-hole son broke a toe while vandalizing (or at least trying to) YOUR property. Probably the reason her son is a jerk.", "i'll say NTA.  you endured four years of having to clean up pumpkin mess.   imo it was time to do something.   and this punk came during the wee hours (aka not during trick or treat time) so if it was outside of the timeframe one would expect random strangers coming to your door on halloween........ it was trespassing.  on top of attempting to destroy private property.  \n\n\nbut i wouldn't do the same for future years. because this lil snot of a kid will tell his friends how 'evil' you are now and they may try to get revenge next year.   and a thrown cement filled pumpkin makes for easy window breaking.", "NTA. I hope his mum understood her kid broke his toe by vandalising your property. Great lesson.", "NTA and that\u2019s hilarious", "NTA, seems like a fair trade to me. pumpkin for a toe.", "NTA. Kid fucked around. Kid found out.", "NTA What did the mother expect you to do? Pay for his injury that he got while destroying other people's property?", "NTA and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s illegal. Believe it or not, there was a legal case about this but in that situation a farmer set up a shotgun to go off if someone broke into his house. Someone did, he was sued. I think the farmer lost, BUT only because it was a shotgun and could be lethal. If you go to YouTube and search the channel LegalEagle, find the video with Mark Rober - genius former NASA engineer and Christmas porch pirate one-man army. His fake packages are considered not harmful enough to cause fatalities.\n\nFascinating and exactly what the kid deserved. He came onto your property to do damage. A pumpkin full of cement can\u2019t kill somebody if they try to smash it.\n\nMark Rober\u2019s annual Christmas videos - his whole YT channel, actually - are great. Enjoy!", "Reminds me of https://xkcd.com/804\nNTA", "LOL! It\u2019s a touch evil and funny as hell. Also possibly illegal depending on where you put the pumpkin.\n\nYTA outside holiday decorations need. I salute you.", "Reminds me of https://xkcd.com/804\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed to put whatever you want on your property.", "NTA. but maybe you should\u2019ve considered bringing in the pumpkins later at night? i\u2019m not american so i don\u2019t really understand halloween etiquette. asides from that totally not the AH, if i may make a suggestion, I would suggest filling a pumpkin with dye next time as it will make a nasty splash and not injure anyone.", "You took deliberate actions planning that they would result in another person's injury.\n\nThe damage to your pumpkins is in no way equivalent to the kid's broken foot.\n\nPassive aggression taken to the foot breaking level.

I highly doubt he told her the truth.", "depending on the culture aka mostly pagans/Celtics, it believed carving up pumpkins and leaving them outside will scare away any wondering spirit where our world and the afterlife gates are at their weakest so any spirit can enter into our world during the day before Samhain which is a celebration and preparing for the darker half of the year on November 1st. it is also in between the autumn equinox and winter solstice.", "No. He was making a concrete pumpkin which used a real pumpkin as a mold. This is because vandals destroyed his prior pumpkins and he\u2019s sick of dealing with it, so opted for a permanent decoration that doesn\u2019t rot. \n\nIt\u2019s not his fault a trespasser entered his real property illegally, attempted to destroy his property and was injured in the process."]}
