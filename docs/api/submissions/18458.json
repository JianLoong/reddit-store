They made themselves look bad!  Talk about terrible parents who teach entitlement instead of gratitude!", "NTA. They managed to look like a holes to their kids all by themselves", "No good deed goes unpunished.\n\nThe older I get the truer this is.\n\nNta", "NTA. They could always book the Grand Floridian on their own dime and just accept the park and plane tickets from you if they are unhappy with the accommodations.", "NTA.  I realize that you offered and they didn't ask but those are some real r/choosingbeggars", "NTA and not your fault if their kids are mad at them. They should be pissed at their parents for being entitled and rude. Free trip to Disney but they're upset they don't get the penthouse or something? So dumb. They're jerks, you're not and you're not responsible for the aftermath of them being the AH here.", "Absolutely NTA you\u2019re doing a very very generous and kind thing for them and they\u2019re being entitled and ungrateful because their FREE vacation isn\u2019t fancy enough", "NTA\n\n> I'm being cheap\n\n\"Sure I am!\"\n\n#\"BUT NOT AS CHEAP AS \\*YOU\\*\"", "NTA. \n\nI find myself constantly just astonished by the level of audacity and entitlement people feel these days. What a bunch of ungrateful AH!  Please leave them at home and ENJOY your vacation with your family. They will be a problem the entire time even if they decide to \u201cslum it\u201d in Disney Springs. Seriously screw them. Learn from this and don\u2019t offer something like it again.", "NTA.  Just cancel their trip.  Otherwise, you'll be dealing with her complaining and lack of gratitude the entire time.", "NTA \n\nWow they're some kind of class A beggars. The only thing is I genuinely hate when kids get punished because adults can't  be civil. I'm also petty is there a way to still bring the kids but leave the parents, but let them all know it's because you don't feel like the kids should be punished because the parents are spoiled brats? Still NTA is you can't/don't, I just hate selfish parents.", "You should post this shit to r/choosingbeggars\n\nNta at all. They just robbed their kids of a vacation. They're bad parents", "NTA.  You are not responsible to satisfy someone else's greed and you should not even think about doing it.   \n\nThey should be grateful that you are gifting them something so substantial instead of demanding you give them even more.  The nerve of those people.", "This is tough. Because since everyone is going at the same time, it does create two tiers (especially since there are perks like early admission and easier transportation make staying on property nicer) I guess the only thing you did \u201cwrong\u201d was not make it clear up front. I honestly would have assumed everyone was staying in the same place. Overall NTA, but it sounds like everyone could use better communication skills.", "Choosing beggars much? Geesh. They\u2019re getting a free trip to Disney and are complaining about it? Wow. Their kids absolutely need to know that mom and dad lost them the trip because this is NOT how one behaves when given something!\n\nNTA.", "NTA, do you even have to ask? Your in-laws should thank their lucky stars for your generosity. They are to blame for their kids anger, their entitlement outweighs their kids happiness.", "NTA. They are the textbook definition of looking a gift horse in the mouth.\n\nI would be tempted to cancel their whole trip, because the negative vibes and how they have handled this do not bode well for the rest of the trip. Personally, the lack of gratefulness would ruin the gesture for me. \n\nAnd their kids should be pissed at them, it\u2019s a hard thing to learn but some parents are idiots. Their kids learned that lesson watching their parents be choosing beggars.", "NTA in any way shape or form.  They sound like some spoiled , entitled aholes.", "NTA. I never understood why people cared so much about where they stay on a vacation to Disney. Obviously something better than a roach infested motel but I mean it\u2019s ultimately just somewhere to sleep after an exhausting long day at Disney.", "NTA, you should educate them about the phrase \"choosing beggars.\"", "NTA.\n\nThese are some real r/choosingbeggars here.\n\nYou are too nice at how you are handling this. I would have just cancelled everything and tell them they can now fuck off.", "NTA though I will admit it is a bit weird to go on vacation with someone and not stay at the same location but they shouldn\u2019t have been assholes about it", "NTA.  It would have been better if you book to stay at the same place they do, but now that it evolved into this, I am not so sure whether you want to book anything for them ever again.", "I would have been humbled and grateful for a trip to Disney with my kids.\n\nNta.", "NTA. Only the most entitled complain about a FREE TO THEM vacation!!! Disney is insanely expensive. It was an incredibly generous offer on your part. If they weren't thankful for it, that is \ud83d\udcaf percent on them. The parents ruined it for their kids.", "Your SIL could have chosen this route:\n\n\u201cYour uncle _______ is just amazing and is offering us this unforgettable trip!  We will be staying at a different location but doing all of the parks and activities together. This will give us chance to have some time with just us as a family too!  Aren\u2019t we lucky to have such generous people in our family?!  We are really so blessed!\u201d \n\nBut, alas, \u201cWAH WAH WAH!!  I WANT MORE MORE MORE!!\u201d", "Let me get this straight...\n\nYou're gifting them airline tickets, park tickets AND a nice hotel and they demand more?\n\nCancel their tickets. Immediately. For their benefit too so they drop this entitled idiocy forever. So the kids learn you get NOTHING if you're being an ass. So they don't try to walk all over you in the future.\n\nNTA.\n\nThat's would be them.\n\nPoor kids...\n\nHeck I'll take this amazing gift with endless gratitude! Disney Springs got 4.85/5 stars.\nI'LL BE SO HAPPY AND GRATEFUL IF ANYONE DID THIS FOR ME!\n\nGuh..", "NTA, firmly so. They are the choosiest of beggars, and don\u2019t seem to understand that they\u2019re not entitled to the exact stay as you. You were trying to do something nice! How entitled and rude. Those poor kids. (Though I am glad to see the kids understand their parents are at fault, not you and your wife!)", "Nta.  They are being entitled and ungrateful.", "Just take the kids.  Fuck those entitled parents.", "NTA\n\nyou\u2019re offering to pay for air line ticket , hotel , and park tickets. And from what i\u2019ve heard you seem very generous and i\u2019m sure you\u2019d be willing to pay for a meal too. However they\u2019re making this harder on themselves than necessary. If they didn\u2019t like the hotel you booked they could\u2019ve talked to you about that privately. To make such a big deal out of a free paid vacation is really hard to comprehend. I can imagine this will cause a rift down the line. I hope you guys can have a normal conversation about the topic so they can understand your perspective as to how much money this is actually costing. \n\nHope you enjoy your disney trip !", "NTA. Their attitude is unhinged. Wow. \n\nHave they displayed this level of entitlement before?", "NTA \n\nClassic case of \u201cgive someone a inch\u201d\u2026.edited to add.. how kind you are. Have a great trip, and if you want to take the kids , I\u2019d take them too.", "Well you are absolutely NTA here\n\nYou got them a holiday - a free holiday - and they are upset because you did it using points? The means by which you paid for their FREE holiday is utterly irrelevant because the are going to disneyworld for free!!!\n\nThe only people who were jealous were your sister in law, but they are responsible for making their kids jealous. They chose to do that. Every choice they made has lead them to being in this situation - those entitles assholes absolutely do not deserve that holiday (but their kids do, obviously). How dare they expect you to **pay** for them to have the same holiday as you?\n\nFeels like something straight out of /r/ChoosingBeggars to be honest.", "Their hotel includes early entrance and a shuttle. I thought it would be nice if we weren't spending every minute together.", "I can understand why you wouldn't want to spend every minute with these people.", "I can\u2019t imagine why, they seem DELIGHTFUL. /s", "That makes it more \u201ceven\u201d. My apologies I didn\u2019t know early entrance was included in those hotels."]}
