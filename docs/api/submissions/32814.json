It wasn\u2019t until they had been together for multiple years, got married, and we all lived together, that he started taking us kids on vacation with them. That initial time was THEIR time to bond.

Plenty of time in between now and then for mom to save some money to take a couple of memory building trips with her daughter. \n\nAs for a 14 year old not being cordial, she\u2019s a young teen who is probably not the happiest that her mom is dating. If she has a dad in her life, she\u2019s probably not happy about another male figure coming into her life abruptly. \nIt might also be worth casually finding out how many men SO has brought around the daughter that didn\u2019t work out. 6 months is fast and I\u2019m willing to bet she\u2019s done this before which is why the daughter doesn\u2019t care to be nice. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t take a 14 year old being unwelcoming to heart but your SO is a walking red flag and I would just cancel the trip altogether if this is how it is.", "NTA, but like others have said here you need to:\n\n1) really assess with yourself if you are ready to date a single mother\n\n2) then if number one is a yes, then assess if this is the right single mother.

Also first and second years absolutely get opportunities to travel. So I'd say she has a good 8-10 years of travel windows before she likely won't be able to travel much for a few years. This is all based on my experience with my best friend who is an ER doc. Also now that he's formally out of school and a full working doctor he travels more than anyone else I know. At least working in a hospital setting I know it's possible to take a full week vacation without using any PTO if you can get your schedule right.

You want a future with your SO, you would need to accept her daughter as well. You are dating her mother for the past 6 months.\nTo expect an early teen to be welcoming of you or cordial to you just like that,  seems a bit  reaching to me.\n\nIf you really are thinking of your SO as significant, you need to realise that the daughter is not gonna vanish from her life.

YTA you have made it very clear that this is your side of the story and basically blaming things on SO\u2019s daughter for not being cordial or welcoming. What efforts have you put forward to be welcoming and cordial yourself towards her? She is what sounds like a typical 14 year old teenager. You have seen SO\u2019s daughter about 10 times in 6 months which honestly I believe is actually quite a bit. \n\n3. For all those who will probably bite my head off for my opinions, I offer this.\n\nNowhere in what OP said about SO\u2019s daughter going to med school did OP say it was/wasn\u2019t her choice about attending medical school.

The other option is if you feel like you shouldn't have to \"pay it back\" \u0253e honest about it, for some,  it's an uncomfortable dynamic, but then it's up to SO and you to either agree on a solution or end it.

OP has already said that the child stays with the father part of the time and could stay with him during the vacation.", "Okay just to be clear here... your opinion is...\n\nIf you date a single parent, then you are immediately 100% responsible financially for that child?  Neither of the actual parents are apparently responsible for the child any more?", "People like you are disgusting.", "That isn\u2019t the problem being discussed here. OP isn\u2019t trying to force a relationship with his girlfriend\u2019s kid. Never once did he say that\u2019s what he wants or doesn\u2019t want. He\u2019s saying that he shouldn\u2019t have to pay to include her on their vacation when he has no relationship with her. That payment should come from the mother. It\u2019s like you guys didn\u2019t even read the post.", "These people are idiots.", "Huh? What effort has \"he\" made? OP says that when daughter is over her place, the mom doesn't make an effort to invite him over. If it's the woman's home and the woman's daughter, it's kind of on her to decide when and how much, wouldn't you say? It's not up to the guy to just barge over. \n\nAs I said before, it totally seemed to me like the mom is hesitant about having her daughter and OP part of each other's lives just yet - which is totally understandable. But if that's the way you want to go, then don't expect a free trip for a kid the guy barely knows. You can't pick and choose the best of both worlds.", "Okay maybe I can meet you halfway, here.  I feel like I attempt to be overly logical as much as possible as it pertains to my emotions/reactions.  And these aren't always logical responses...\n\nBut does \"more likely\" = automatic? \n\nBecause I'm specifically referring to the assumption and automatic labelling of \"gonna have an issue.\"", "You shouldn\u2019t be downvoted for this. This is a fact. When you date parents, you have to expect their child to be treated with respect, regardless of how they treat you. It\u2019s a child, you\u2019re an adult. Grow tf up.", "You are so hung up on the paying part, huh? Look, I'm not saying he is the asshole. I'm not saying that he should adopt her kid or pay for her kid. I'm saying, if a mom says they are a packaged deal when you start dating, then plan on her wanting to bring her child with her when she is gone for long periods of time, especially when she has the child that weekend. Sometimes, dropping the kid off with the other parent isn't an option. Especially if the parents are from two different areas, and her school is in a specific area.\n\nOP isn't the asshole, but maybe they need to have a long talk about if the relationship is gonna work.", "But the woman told OP before even entering a relationship that they come as a package deal. He had the option to accept that or not get into the relationship. She has said that if he isn\u2019t willing to allow the daughter to come then she won\u2019t go on the trip, and that\u2019s her right.", "My opinion is if you\u2019re dating a single parent don\u2019t be surprised that they don\u2019t want to leave their kid for 4 days to go on your vacation\u2026\n\nAnd god forbid you pay for some kids vacation. How awful that would be \ud83d\ude44", "Look, if the single parent drags her kid in to a situation, that's on them, not the guy hoping for a quick few days away with his new gf.\nThe day single parents stop dragging their kids in to their new relationships is the day I'll stop saying it.\n\nPeople, put your kids first, don't expect others to.", "Dating a parent isn\u2019t like dating a single adult. They\u2019re not always going to want to leave their kid behind to go on dates. They\u2019re always going to be on parent mode first. OP is not entitled to pay and shouldn\u2019t have to pay, but the point remains is you don\u2019t want to deal with situations like these date someone with no other obligations or children.", "I've known many people as adults who've changed their minds about what they want to do - heck, I did! I started 1 degree at uni, realised it wasn't for me, worked for a year to get some money and then started a different one. My A levels were broad enough I could have done most things - not restricted to a certain field.  \n\n\nFor others there's different options. Some people can go to college (college here is 16+ and often a 6th form college (16-18 years old) but adults attend too). There you can resit some A levels to pick more relevant ones or do other courses which are more specialised/practical based. Someone I know didn't get the A level grades she needed for her chosen career so went to college and did a special course which basically gave her those qualifications in the area she needed - she's now happy in the job she wanted.\n\nSomeone else I know realised as an adult they wanted to change career and as they'd been out of education for a certain number of years they had to go to college to do an \"access course\" which is basically a course where you do english, science and maths to refresh things so you can apply for a degree course at uni. This friend had a course which focused more on sciences as they wanted to go into the medical field.  \n\n\nUnless you want something very specialised (like the medical field or law) you can get into most degrees with a wide range of a levels. Most 15/16 year olds I know (and I work with a lot of them!) have a rough idea of what they want to do so can pick relevant things. Unless things have changed you generally pick 4 AS levels to do when you're 16-17 and drop one of those and do 3 A levels. So the AS level is half of a subject/the basics of it. Some people choose to do more depending on their timetable/how much they want to do but certainly 4 and then 3 used to be the norm. If you go to a college at 16 you may pick something else like doing a childcare course or an art course for 2 years instead of multiple separate subjects.\n\nOh.. and to age myself we also had to do a more general thing where we learned how to use computers/create word documents and make excel spreadsheets etc lol.", "Yeah, idk why so many people want her to be a villian. For all we know, she's perfectly polite without being overly concerned with bonding. He may not take that well. Who knows.\n\nBut, hey. It's reddit. Downvotes happen. \ud83e\udd37", "That\u2019s not how relationships work.\n\nI understand he may feel it\u2019s too early to bring the kid on a vacation. But then it\u2019s too early to bring his girlfriend on a vacation as well. It would be one thing if OP and the kid hadn\u2019t met yet (6 months seems too early to even be introducing them, and I say that as a single mom myself) but they have, they\u2019ve not only met, but several times. It\u2019s up to BOTH OP and the single parent to foster a relationship with the kid. \n\nRegardless it\u2019s really simple; she laid out a boundary before they even entered the relationship: \u201cmy kid and I are a package deal\u201d. Not every single parent feels that way to this degree, but she does. If he didn\u2019t want to accept that, he shouldn\u2019t have continued the relationship.", "If you get good enough grades to do medicine then there are a million other courses you can take without having to sit more exams.", "I didn't know that the system actually workes like this...do you also het sorted into houses? I had an english teacher once that mentioned at boarding schools that can be a thing, is that true? The inner school rivslry in sports and for being the smartest, best behaved house with points and all?", "Works entirely different for us, there are certsin requirements you have to meet so you have a few choices you can pick from but it's not thst open and you end up with a universal high school degree here.", "True. Going back to OP's issue, I agree with the 1st comment, this woman sounds like she's using OP , she invited her child whom he barely knows to there trip and expects him to pay for her! Mum's like her makes dating hard for other single mums, because a lot of guys are nervous to date them because of bring used as a ATM or just wanting a father figure their kids. OP run!  NTA", "Yeah, having to do college before med school and lesrnung unnecessary bs seems really like a waste of time and money. Is there a reason it's done that way?", "Exactly this. And English, Maths, and Science are mandatory GCSEs. If a 14 year old has any plans to be a doctor, they\u2019re definitely going to take what they need to, and switching uni courses would almost certainly pose no problems. The only time it\u2019s been a real issue is if a student takes minimal Maths and Science, fills up with Arts and RAFA courses, then decides to study medicine of any kind.", "I taught at a middle school in the US that sorted kids into houses.  There were four houses.  And every day each house went together and did some activities.  It was really great because you had older kids teaching younger kids. \n\nBut, our principal really liked Harry Potter.  As a side note,  she was also really good at her job. It's probably one of the best principles I have ever worked with.", "Yes! Generally, Red, Blue, Yellow and Green. My sons highschool the different houses have different ties. Literally like hogwarts. And Generally they are assigned a house in first or secondary (or primary) school and it continues until they leave highschool. Unless they move area/schools.", "Often, yes. Least likely at a Comprehensive, more likely at a Grammar, almost certainly at Public (private in NA). Points and all.", "Some schools offer different kinds of degrees above and beyond. Mine is an academic scholar degree, but I did it mostly for the meter long pencil it comes with."]}
