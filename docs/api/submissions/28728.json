And you should tell your husband that!", "NTA. You did the right thing, it's the same if a random stranger shows up and Wats to touch your stomach normally. It's weird, creepy and invasive of your personal space.

Who does that? Who thinks it's okay to touch a woman without her consent? Why does your husband think it's okay to touch any woman without her consent, never mind his wife?\n\nI'd be very concerned about him as a father and the likelihood he'll teach your child that strangers touching women without consent is okay. In what other ways is he a misogynist?", "No fucking way are you the asshole; your husband is for telling you to just take it. How would he like it if some stranger just grabbed his crotch? Would he let it happen or would he stand up for himself?\n\nPeople who want to touch a pregnant stranger's baby bump are entitled, crazy jerks. When my sister was pregnant, she gave me the \"Baby Bump Bouncer\" job to prevent this exact thing (she was pregnant in 2020, so we never ran into crazies, lol; I can be feral & BIL would've unleashed The Beast, too). You are absolutely right to stand up for yourself. If you raising your voice at that shit-bag gives him second thoughts on doing it again, fan-fucking-tastic; you would've saved another innocent from his creepy touch.\n\nPeople will always tell girls & women to just take it because we're expected to smile & be obedient.

But like\u2026 especially don\u2019t touch the pregnant belly unless you want hard core mamma bear to come out. Honestly I\u2019d just start slapping hands and growling at people.

How would he like complete strangers rubbing his belly.  He should be more upset about this.", "NTA.  A pregnant woman's bump is NOT public property.  Frankly, it's weird for a stranger to ask to touch the baby bump of someone they don't know, IMO.  But even friends  and family should ask before just assuming they have the right.\n\nThat said, I must have some world class RBF because in three pregnancies, no one ever asked to touch my baby bump.
