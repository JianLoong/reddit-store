Now as an inpatient psych nurse for over 10 years, I don\u2019t spook easily, but this was by far one of my scariest encounters. I felt so vulnerable because there was so little I could physically do at this point. And if he was so bold and brazen in public, then what would happen if he found me alone?

Because women have historically been expected for their bodies to be constrained and not take up space that the pregnant body that is expanding and could \u201cleak\u201d it is so other that makes people feel like they have to comment or touch.
