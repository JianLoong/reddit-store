And great that you\u2019re relieved from any future babysitting. Enjoy your newfound freedom!", "NTA - and it looks like your brother has shot himself in the foot over this one. He doesn't seem to care about your time or your mother's (is she his mother too? Because that is even worse of him).\n\nOne thing to watch out for though: assuming he follows through on his \"threat\" watch out in case he spreads false stories about you and why you don't see his kids as much. I have seen this sort of thing happen before so be ready to shut down lies he tells others.", "Sometimes, the trash takes itself out.  NTA", "NTA \n\nYou had valid reasons for drawing a boundary and he had been taking advantage of you by leaving them with you for indefinite periods of time for no compensation. Sounds like he has made alternative plans for child minding and you are off the hook. That's not a bad thing. You can now focus on taking care of your mum and yourself. Winning!\n\nI know you probably miss the kids but I'm sure you can find ways to see them during family functions and such.", "Thank you!! Everyone, the older I get the more I\u2019m starting to notice more of his manipulation tactics. Since this is about my nieces and nephews and family, I get a little triggered by his comments sometimes but I know I did the right thing.", "NTA. The audacity of your brother. \n\nDont babysit again for him.", "NTA your brother is such a loser", "NTA your brother is. He needs to find someone who can drive themselves and pay them to stay at his house. He has no consideration for you or your mom. Time he grows up and starts being a responsible parent.", "NTA and I hate parents who get entitled like this and think people should all bend over backwards so they can go get drunk. They chose to have kids but still want to go party and get fucked up. They also don't pay you and expect you to just help them out last minute. They're selfish and entitled. I would see him not asking yiou anymore as a blessing.", "Nta\n\nHe is trying to manipulate you. Good job rejecting that shit.\n\nAlso its pathetic to be over 40 with 3 kids and getting wasted at music festivals forgetting them till hours after agreed pickup time.", "NTA.", "NTA, he is manipulating you to make it seem like he is right. He is just irresponsible", "NTA - his behavior isn\u2019t very PLUR of him.", "> My brother\n\n> my mom \n\nINFO: You mean *his* mom too? Surely he knows all the same surgery details as you; why is he going to music concerts rather than helping out?", "NTA. You stepped up for him in the past and he abused your generosity. You agreed to help out again but with totally reasonable limits and he basically said it should be your problem that he will be intoxicated at a future date and time and unable to care for his children. Dude sounds like a real winner.", "Huh, being an aunt doesn't mean you're an always ready babysitter on their beck and call. Why would you be TA? It's not like it's some one time thing and they had to ask for help because they have some emergency.", "NTA.  And let's hope brother carries through on his threat.", "NTA, not trying to be a white knight, but it all sounds like a typical situation of asking the female of the family to take care of everyone at any moments notice. Like, you already have to take of your mom **just after surgery**, which god I hope he at least knows that since I assume it's his mom too.\n\nFor sake, he's 44, married. If they prefer you to babysit rather than a stranger I understand but at this point they are just abusing the fact that they couldn't act like that outside of family. He's in a decent enough situation to go to music festival, I think he can afford a babysitter.", "NTA. No one is owed free, on demand child care. Part of being a parent is accepting the fact that there are things you may really want to do but you're not able to. \nWhen you add in the fact that they don't stick to the original times agreed to, you're even more NTA.", "NTA! Shame on them for taking advantage of you, then blaming you because the don\u2019t want to PARENT! Oh fucking well\u2026suck it up and don\u2019t go out. They choose to have three kids not you!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
