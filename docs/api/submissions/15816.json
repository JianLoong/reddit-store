A lot of states have childcare funding and they will pay a person to do it if the parent doesn\u2019t want to take them to a center. It would be a lot more than $20 to you and she might even qualify for a $0 copayment. \n\nHowever, NTA. You are doing something out of the kindness of your heart and 2 kids is a lot to handle for free.", "NTA. She\u2019s at work earning money and while you\u2019re watching her kids you can\u2019t do the same. She\u2019s in a tough situation for sure and it\u2019s lovely you\u2019ve been helping her but it\u2019s now at the point she\u2019s taking advantage of your kindness and knows she can use you as free babysitting.", "YWNBTA.   \nShe is using you, and will continue to use you for as long as you let her.", "NTA. If she\u2019s struggling that much, she may be able to get childcare assistance through the state.  This is a lot of extra work, but if you cared enough (and this is by no means your responsibility), you could offer to help her with her budget and see if she CAN actually pay you. The gift of a budget is one that keeps giving and she may not know how because she\u2019s just starting out.", "NTA, I think it\u2019s possible since you were already doing it for such a low cost and so frequently she might have been saying she couldn\u2019t pay to see if she could get it for even less than she already was. \n\n5 days a week is a lot for a neighbour even at a decent wage, you aren\u2019t obligated to her in any way so you are allowed to cut it off whenever even if she was paying you well.", "Could you help her looking into state care? Help her with potential appointments or things she needs to fill out. It's like the story about teaching a man to fish, right? So help her stand on her own two feet. But don't let her use you. She won't learn or grow on it, and neither of you will tank you for it down the road.  \nOh, and NTA.", "NTA\n\nBut I would give her plenty of warning. Dropping something like that on a single mother last minute would be an AH move.  She needs to apply for childcare assistance. And, that takes time.", "Stop letting her use you.  You deserve to be paid for her time.\n\nShe and her baby daddy can figure out how to pay for the kids.  NTA", "INFO: Is she receiving child support from the father(s)? If not, has she pursued legal means to obtain child support?", "NTA maybe suggest she goes to get childcare assistances and other benefits to help her situation... she probably can get cash assistances since her pay is low...", "This is horrific. I'm so sorry she has had these horrible things happen to her. \n\nYou're seriously a really good person for helping her. I dont think you would be the AH if you suggested, gently of course, that maybe she needs to find an alternative arrangement. It sounds like you're a really patient, giving person, but you have to look after yourself too. Maybe you can help her with finding the alternative arrangement. \n\nAgain, big ups to you for helping her out where you can, but it's also ok to have a limit. If I were in your shoes I'd start it as a conversation, a heads-up to her, but give her some time to sort something out. If you said \"this has to stop immediately\" I don't think you'd be the AH but I also think it isn't the best way you can handle it.", "You watch them 5 days a week ? What does she do during this time ?? Is she working or studying ? If she\u2019s working full time how on earth can\u2019t she pay $15 ?? Either way ridiculous. She\u2019s not your problem- NTA", "NTA. Tell her to check into state assisted childcare. I work at a nursery and have several kids that the state pays for.", "NTA. Even if you like babysitting her kids, it\u2019s on your time and babysitting is something that requires your full attention and effort - especially babies and toddlers.", "NTA. You sound very kind and like you want to help, but the way you have been is no longer working for you. Would you want to help in other ways like researching programs she could apply to so that she had more money for daycare? Or would you be willing to provide some childcare if it fits around your schedule? It\u2019s not your responsibility to do so. If you decide that the amount of help you can provide is none you are still NTA, but it sounds like you care for your neighbors and would like to be involved in some way. Explaining the kind of help you can give might soften the blow of loosing her childcare a bit and help your neighbor feel like you are still part of her support system.", "You wouldn't be an asshole if you give her time to make other arrangements. You said you let it slip a few times when she couldn't pay, if you say  \"okay now I'm not doing anything anymore find another sitter for tomorrow\" out of the blue, that would be kind of shitty. Not that you are required to do anything for her, it's very generous that you helped her out so much, but still, if you care for her give her time to work something out. \nIf you care for her, maybe you can help her file for state assistance?\nYou could also transition slowly if you don't mind. Like instead of babysitting 5 times a week, you take her kids for 2 days a week, that she is at least able to go to work for a bit to afford her rent and food?", "NTA.  Sounds like she needs more help than you can give her.  She needs to reach out to a local women's shelter for advice on who can help her and how.  They have so many resources and, even if she isn't staying there, can be of great assistance to her.  You are very kind to have given so much thus far.", "NAH\n\nYou yourself agree and see how hard she is trying to make the best out of this undoubtedly TOUGH situation. Her not being able to pay anymore is kind of a sign there are some really tough times ahead maybe.\n\nYET I do feel you are also in your right to want a little repayment for watching the kids 5 days a week. You are not their family after all and now it is starting to affect your personal situation as well.\n\nIT IS A BAD SITUATION regardless of the perspective.\n\nIf you can find it in your heart to still support her, we would all applaud you for it. Yet to not fall back on your own situation, you are absolutely in your right to see with her if you two cannot find a new arrangement so she still gets a decent coverage for her kids and you get your own issues resolved. Even you two agreeing to another kind of compensation or later just a later on repayment might be an option.\n\nRegardless of what you do, I hope you two figure things out to both of your liking!", "NTA a job is a job. You already do enough by giving her a discount so you can quit if she doesn\u2019t pay you.", "NTA\n\nBut she's going to need some warning. Could you help find other people that can assist in watching the kids? If it wasn't all on you I'm sure it would be a lot easier to do the things you need to do in your own life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
