{"id": 30364, "submission_id": "17ob906", "title": "AITA: Wealthy Friend Made Me Split the Bill", "selftext": "I (36F) have been friends with a guy (48M), we will call him Rob, for years. He\u2019s a very wealthy and successful guy, does very well for himself, and has no kids, never been married before, etc. He is a serial dater and his goal is to date the hottest girls he can. He spends sometimes thousands on them every week in buying them gifts, dinners, and straight up giving them cash.  It\u2019s his thing and one of the ways he likes to spend his money. Whatever floats his boat, his life, his money, I don\u2019t judge and if he\u2019s happy then I\u2019m happy for him. \n\nHowever, recently, he went through an awful breakup that sent him spiraling and I was there every day and night to talk to him on the phone, offer him advice, read his sometimes over a hundred messages a day and otherwise console him. We\u2019re talking hours every day that I was spending on him and it went on for weeks. Quite honestly, it was exhausting after awhile and there was definitely a lot of trauma dumping going on. I am a single mom who works full time and I don\u2019t always have a lot of free time or mental energy but I did my best to support him. He recently invited me out to dinner saying that he \u201cowes me\u201d for all of the support I\u2019ve given him, so we went out to a really nice restaurant and had a nice dinner, until the end.\n\nThe check arrived and he stated \u201cAlright, we\u2019re splitting this thing.\u201d I was shocked, as he wanted this dinner and invited me! When I questioned him and also informed him that I had to pay $100+ to a babysitter to be able to go out with him, he insisted that he\u2019s not paying for me, that we are just friends. I\u2019m able to support myself and my kids obviously but going out is a treat because of how costly everything gets, $100 is a lot for me.\n\nI sent him my half and left shortly after, somewhat upset, as I felt blindsided by this and also felt that he should\u2019ve treated, given the fact that he invited me and also because he makes exponentially more than me and knows my struggles sometimes as a single mom. AITA for being upset with him? Would love some insight before I confront him.\n\ntl/dr: Wealthy friend made me pay half of the expensive dinner bill even though he invited me to the dinner and he knows what a financial burden it is for me to go out. AITA for being upset?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all of the great replies. I really appreciate all of the insight!! Just wanted to clarify a few things:\n\n1.) I have no romantic interest in this guy. Zero. I\u2019m not jilted and upset nor do I have some fantasy that he will be with me. It\u2019s just not like that with him.\n\n2.) For the people saying that nobody owes me a dinner just because they make more money, you are absolutely right. However, if I had a friend or family member in a tight financial situation and I had the means to pay, I would feel horrible taking money from them.

This guy isn\u2019t your friend, he\u2019s a user.  The invitation to dinner and the \u201cI owe you\u201d would make anyone assume that he was paying for the meal.  Block this guy and move on.  He is using you as a therapist instead of treating you as a friend.  You have enough  on your plate without this self centered guy wasting your time dumping his break up woes on you.  You will breathe a sigh of relief that you don\u2019t have to answer his messages anymore.  And don\u2019t fall for any apologies, he doesn\u2019t care about you, he will just be upset he lost his free therapist.  He is way too old to be acting like this.", "NTA\n\nHe invited you and said he owed you for all the support you've given him, what exactly was he treating you with? Gracing you with his presence??\n\nHe is absolutely the asshole. I would tell him that you're not feeling appreciated as a friend and you feel hurt by him saying he owed you and then not actually giving you anything. And then distance yourself from him.", "NTA. If he said \"I owe you and would love to take you to dinner\" that implies he is treating. \n\nThe next time he calls you to vent, tell him you charge $200 an hour for counseling, since you two are  \"just friends.\"", "NTA \n\nHe did that to make it clear it wasn\u2019t a date. You are so low in his eyes, you\u2019re not even worthy of a meal. Never, ever answer his calls again.", "NTA.  His being wealthy has nothing to do with it.  He invited you out and and said he \"owes\"  you so the expectation was that he was going to pay for the check.\n\nWhen you calm down, tell him how you felt blindsided and this was a lot of money for you.  See what he says.", "NTA because he said i owe you. Like how does splitting a bill say thank you for being there for me? But his wealth has nothing to do with it.", "NTA.\n\nTo me, it sounds like a situation in which you need to be putting boundaries in place...he shouldn't be sending you more than a hundred messages a day because his dating life is in turmoil. If he needs that level of support, he should be seeing a therapist.\n\nIt's really strange that he invited you out for dinner under the pretence of I owe you one, then didn't pay, but reading all of this this sounds like a man who ultimately associates financial transactions like this with sexual transactions. It sounds unhealthy as hell and I would be cutting him from my friendship circle.\n\nIt sounds like this is a friendship in which you're doing a lot of the heavy lifting.", "Not a friend. A taker. A user.\n\nNever take his call again", "NTA\n\nBy the heading, I assumed I\u2019d end up giving a different judgment. That\u2019s most definitely *not the case.*\n\nRob - probably not consciously - is using you as a means to punish other women who disappointed him or just wanted him for his money. \n\nHe wants all the attributes of a friend from you but wants to treat you like an ex. \n\nThe key issue I see with this whole scenario is that Rob essentially tricked you. He invited you out, he selected the place and price point. It was reasonable to expect him to pay the bill. But he didn\u2019t, instead he blindsides you.\n\nI would respond to him like this:\n\n*Unlike other women in your life - like the ones you date, I\u2019m not friends with you because of your money. However, this dinner you invited me to because you  \u201cowed me\u201d showed how little you appreciate my friendship. I sacrificed a lot of time to help you through a rough time. That\u2019s time from my kids and the little free time I have. But you matter so I did so. I spend $100 for a babysitter so you can take me out to dinner as a thank you. You then blindside me with a bill when I was your guest at a restaurant you picked. That\u2019s unacceptable. I didn\u2019t agree to pay for an expensive meal because that\u2019s not within my budget. If you want to split costs, then we need to do affordable or even free things together. But you want to do what you want regardless of what it costs me. You\u2019re not being a good friend and you actually abused our friendship in this situation.*\n\nEdit\n\nI had a male friend who often used me as a sounding board. I liked being a problem solver. It made me feel insightful and powerful. But then I realized that our interactions were all about him. A night of his complaints drained me. There was always something new to complain about with a lot of repeated issues. I started trying to talk about me more & my issues and interests. He verbally fought me on this. Once I realized that we weren\u2019t really friends, I was *his* counselor, I let the relationship go. You may be in the same situation.

When he invited you because he owes you, it is implied the dinner is on him.", "NTA.\n\nYou said it yourself : you're a good friend and he spends money on women he dates and has sex with.

How were you supposed to interpret it any other way? Plus, knowing your financial situation and you guys' difference in disposable income, he chose a nice restaurant. I bet he didn't consult you before choosing the type of establishment, right? I totally get that you were blindsided.\n\nIs he always this thoughtless?\n\nNTA", "NTA.

He said he owes you for all the support you\u2019ve been giving him. Clearly he only thinks he has to pay for dinner if the person is going to sleep with him. That\u2019s gross.

I wanted to let you know that I am very hurt by how you treated me when we went for dinner. While I am/was under no illusions that this was any kind of a date situation, you invited me out for dinner because you said you \u201cowed\u201d me for all the support I gave you during your last breakup. That implied that the dinner was your treat. You pulled a bait and switch when the bill arrived. \n\nIf you had always intended this dinner to be an equal split, you should have made that clear at the moment of invitation, NOT after I accepted and you knew that I would also have to arrange/pay for a sitter for the evening. 100 dollars may be pocket change to you, but you know it is not to me.\n\nWhile you are correct that it wasn\u2019t a date and we\u2019re just friends, you seemed to have no issues blurring the lines between \u201cfriend\u201d and \u201ctherapist\u201d when you were busy sending me 100 texts a day whining about your breakup. I should send you a bill, but I won\u2019t.\n\nGoing forward, I am now drawing the lines. I am not your therapist, and we are no longer friends. The next time you need a shoulder to cry on, please message/call someone else, as I am now blocking your number and moving on with my life.\u201d\n\nThen immediately block before he can respond and try and spin things. \n\nI doubt this will change how this dude operates, but people like this also need to be called out once in a while to know that some people can see through the BS.", "NTA.

She\u2019s also a single mom that\u2019s just kinda shitty. I don\u2019t know what this guy has been through and he probably feels used for his money and is testing you you maybe?

When you say you owe someone it\u2019s implied the invitation means he\u2019s paying. But you\u2019re too available to him, he\u2019s using you.

Even people who are in their lives long term become worthy of suspicions, they may just be playing the long game.  I'm taking a guess here, but I am betting your friend wants to make it absolutely clear he is friends with you for 100% non monetary purposes and doesnt want to have to worry about losing yet another person he thought he trusted because they were after his money.\n\nIm going with NAH.  Sure him saying he \"owes\" you SHOULD mean he is treating you to dinner, but I think you need to take the entirety of the situation into account.

He\u2019s a very wealthy and successful guy, does very well for himself, and has no kids, never been married before, etc. He is a serial dater and his goal is to date the hottest girls he can. He spends sometimes thousands on them every week in buying them gifts, dinners, and straight up giving them cash.  It\u2019s his thing and one of the ways he likes to spend his money. Whatever floats his boat, his life, his money, I don\u2019t judge and if he\u2019s happy then I\u2019m happy for him. \n\nHowever, recently, he went through an awful breakup that sent him spiraling and I was there every day and night to talk to him on the phone, offer him advice, read his sometimes over a hundred messages a day and otherwise console him. We\u2019re talking hours every day that I was spending on him and it went on for weeks. Quite honestly, it was exhausting after awhile and there was definitely a lot of trauma dumping going on. I am a single mom who works full time and I don\u2019t always have a lot of free time or mental energy but I did my best to support him. He recently invited me out to dinner saying that he \u201cowes me\u201d for all of the support I\u2019ve given him, so we went out to a really nice restaurant and had a nice dinner, until the end.\n\nThe check arrived and he stated \u201cAlright, we\u2019re splitting this thing.\u201d I was shocked, as he wanted this dinner and invited me! When I questioned him and also informed him that I had to pay $100+ to a babysitter to be able to go out with him, he insisted that he\u2019s not paying for me, that we are just friends. I\u2019m able to support myself and my kids obviously but going out is a treat because of how costly everything gets, $100 is a lot for me.\n\nI sent him my half and left shortly after, somewhat upset, as I felt blindsided by this and also felt that he should\u2019ve treated, given the fact that he invited me and also because he makes exponentially more than me and knows my struggles sometimes as a single mom. AITA for being upset with him? Would love some insight before I confront him.\n\ntl/dr: Wealthy friend made me pay half of the expensive dinner bill even though he invited me to the dinner and he knows what a financial burden it is for me to go out.

It will always be a one way street with him.", "I went into this ready to say Y T A since nobody owes anyone dinner, but after reading it's a strong NTA.\n\nNot even because you've been there for him during his breakup, that's what friends do, but because it's tacky af to take someone to an expensive restaurant without discussing if the bill is being split. It's \\*especially\\* bad to do that after saying he \"owed\" you, which of course gave you every reason to see it as a \"thank you\" dinner for helping him out during the breakup.\n\nAlso the reasoning is downright bizarre? I'm a gay man and I've paid countless dinners to female friends, it's straight up ridiculous to imply people only treat someone else for dinner when there's a romantic undertone to it. Sorry your friend acted like such an AH.", "NTA\n\nSounds like he is punishing you for being in the friendzone", "NTA", "NTA. Let him go bother someone else with his troubles. That\u2019s probably why his relationship ended. He sounds selfish", "I\u2019m sorry, but who let\u2019s a single mom pay for a meal. For all the dumb things we waste our money on how does anyone justify going Dutch with a friend, especially a single mom. I get it, we all have seasons when money is tight, etc. \n\nYou did what was right, you invested care in your friend and although you got burned, now you know to set healthy boundaries with your time and relationships. The money and the love you gave will come back around to either to you or your kids one day. \n\nNow, forgive & ditch the d bag and never entertain giving him a minute of your time. You\u2019ve got other friends and future relationships that warrant the best of you.", "I was expecting something else based on how this started. He invited you\u2026it is reasonable to expect him to pay. NTA\n\nEverything else preceding doesn\u2019t matter and makes it seem like you are only putting up with this guy on the off chance that he offers you something of value.", "Nta,he's no friend to you, he's a user", "\n I would quit speaking to him. If he asks why tell him you will need to begin charging him for the therapy sessions. He is using you. I agree that he doesn't owe you because he makes more money. That was a silly thing to say. You should have been hurt that he uses you as a dumpster for his feelings and doesn't respect you and your opinion enough to pick up a tab.", "NTA  . I think the best course of action is to send him a bill for all of your time spent consoling him and being there for him , sort of what a therapist does . He is an asshole that needs to be ghosted .", "Send him a bill as Support staff if nothing else.", "Send him a bill as Support staff if nothing else.", "NTA but i would not let a rich friend pick the location unless there was a clear understanding of ability to pay my way comfortably. I have childhood friends who are well off and when they choose the venue i always confirm \u201cyou\u2019re paying, right?\u201d", "I\u2019d flat out tell him to go f himself \\, his ex made a very lucky escape and I totally get why she dumped him and block him everywhere.", "I think this is a perfect, and OP, I hope you send him this text or something similar. Then cut the friendship off. This guy seems to think his money alone makes people feel privileged to be friends with him. That\u2019s not a friend.", "I\u2019d go a step further and say do not give him the courtesy of closure.  Just block him, and let him spend sleepless nights trying to figure out precisely what he did.", "They did you dirty! Sorry that happened to you, what jerks!", "He offered to take OP out to dinner because he \"owes her\" (his words) for all the support aka free therapy. How does making someone pay off your debt to them make any sense? That's like wow you have been so great to me I want to take you to the mall and watch you pick out and pay for your own prize.", "Yes. Consider the meal and babysitter the cost of realizing what a scuzzball Rob is.", "FYI, almost every title is like that, especially ones that are fake. They are engineered to trigger and emotional response and engagements to read the entirety of the thread, so more replies, upvotes etc. \n\nIt\u2019s pervasive in the community.", "Does he though?", "My guess is OP is his only reliable source of emotional intimacy, because I can't imagine his various sugar babies actually care for him that much. But she's not \"dating material\" for him so he has to remind her/himself of that by putting her in her place when he gets too emotionally vulnerable with her.", "Yeah I can't tell if it's exactly that but there's definitely a hint of passive-aggressiveness in \"alright, we're splitting this\". I wonder if OP unwittingly offended the friend in some way and this was his way of putting her in her place.\n\nNot that it justifies the friend's AH behavior, of course, it just might explain it some.", "I think it was a power move as well.  For all the reasons you listed.", "That\u2019s when you go to the bathroom and walk out", "Yeah I personally agree !\nway more savage to just move on... \nI would personally take this as the cost of learning how someone feels about you and ice him out.", "But none of this is required.  He said \u201cI owe you\u201d and invited her to dinner.  At this point OP had every reason to assume that he was treating that evening.", "If anyone said \u201cI owe you for ___, let\u2019s go out to dinner\u201d. I\u2019d automatically assume they\u2019re treating me, hence the \u201cI owe you\u201d stated before the invitation.", "Speech to text won't be able to differentiate between \"OP\" and \"Opie\". I have my phone read calendar event titles aloud and it reads \"IT Meeting\" as \"it meeting\" and not as \"I T Meeting\". Same for \"AT\", which at my work is an acronym for \"Academic Technology\"; my phone reads it as \"at\" and not \"A T\".", "I think what OP was trying to say is that he can definitely afford it. I\u2019d feel bad accepting a free dinner from someone struggling, no matter how many favors I\u2019d done for them. But if they\u2019re rich and been saving 1000s in therapy courtesy of me, yes you can treat me to a dinner.", "The friendzone isn't real, incel.", "How did you get that out of the post?? Not that she's a very kind friend who wanted to help, who went out of her way to try and be there for him? Just assuming women are only nice because they want something?? Gross answer. Maybe you are a user and money grubber, so you're projecting?", "Just curious, is there a limit to the number of people calling you out, that would make you question your view on the matter?", "We can go further", "the energy im getting from this post is the \"I owe you\" was bait to get her dressed up he wanted sex and dinner she said no and he said ok im not paying then were just friends they are both users and I want to says shes the asshole", "Yeah, the \"Alright, we're splitting this thing\" makes me think less \"he never intended to pay\" and more \"he tried making moves on her all night and she didn't notice, so he decided she wasn't worth spending money on\".", "I am a petty person when I feel wronged.  And I think saying \u201cthanks\u201d and smiling, and then blocking someone is a perfect way to communicate that they can get f*cked.  Then he can sit there wondering what changed between the time I was smiling and the moment I blocked him.", "Yeah, it really comes off as an attempt to 'put her in her place' ... like he couldn't allow that single mother to think she had a shot with him after she saw him at his most vulnerable.\n\nOP, this guy is not your friend.", "He sounds like the kind of guy who would invite a woman to dinner, pick up the tab but later, when she wouldn't sleep with him, tell her \"But I bought you dinner!\"", "Not to mention he actually DOES owe her-for the hours and hours of daily free therapy. She put her life on hold for him for weeks. It's not just the language!  He's a petty little bitch.", "I should specify, I assume I am paying my share unless you specifically say you are treating me.", "A friend inviting you out to hangout and eat does not mean they are gonna pay for you, until they say something like \"my treat\" or \" I owe you\"", "I'd assume I'm paying my own part of the bill. Like, at least in my circles nobody is loaded and can afford to buy everyone lunch or dinner or whatever. Unless I'm being taken out specifically as a thank you for something I've done for that person, I don't think anyone in my circle would expect someone else to pay for them.", "Yeah I can't help but feel there's a little more to the story. His vibe is so abruptly rude. It feels retaliatory.", "Yeah, I got that feeling too. That guy's horrible.", "Maybe it was some twisted way of his to get OP to put out", "This", "Totally!", "Right, I agree.  He was basically saying to her \u201cI don\u2019t pay for women I\u2019m not f*cking.\u201d  Petty af.", "It depends on how it's worded. Saying \"let's go out to dinner\" implies that each person pays his or her own way. But \"I owe you\" definitely implies that the other person is treating you. If you're not sure, you can always suggest an inexpensive restaurant, explaining that his choice is not within your budget, and see how he reacts.", "I have a very wealthy friend and we go out all the time and I always pay my share.  It would be weird for her to pay for me.  It does not matter who invites who or how much money they have, in my circle, we all pay our own way.", "All you need is to look at the title of this post.
