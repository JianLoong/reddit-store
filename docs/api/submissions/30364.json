He\u2019s a very wealthy and successful guy, does very well for himself, and has no kids, never been married before, etc. He is a serial dater and his goal is to date the hottest girls he can. He spends sometimes thousands on them every week in buying them gifts, dinners, and straight up giving them cash.  It\u2019s his thing and one of the ways he likes to spend his money. Whatever floats his boat, his life, his money, I don\u2019t judge and if he\u2019s happy then I\u2019m happy for him. \n\nHowever, recently, he went through an awful breakup that sent him spiraling and I was there every day and night to talk to him on the phone, offer him advice, read his sometimes over a hundred messages a day and otherwise console him. We\u2019re talking hours every day that I was spending on him and it went on for weeks. Quite honestly, it was exhausting after awhile and there was definitely a lot of trauma dumping going on. I am a single mom who works full time and I don\u2019t always have a lot of free time or mental energy but I did my best to support him. He recently invited me out to dinner saying that he \u201cowes me\u201d for all of the support I\u2019ve given him, so we went out to a really nice restaurant and had a nice dinner, until the end.\n\nThe check arrived and he stated \u201cAlright, we\u2019re splitting this thing.\u201d I was shocked, as he wanted this dinner and invited me! When I questioned him and also informed him that I had to pay $100+ to a babysitter to be able to go out with him, he insisted that he\u2019s not paying for me, that we are just friends. I\u2019m able to support myself and my kids obviously but going out is a treat because of how costly everything gets, $100 is a lot for me.\n\nI sent him my half and left shortly after, somewhat upset, as I felt blindsided by this and also felt that he should\u2019ve treated, given the fact that he invited me and also because he makes exponentially more than me and knows my struggles sometimes as a single mom. AITA for being upset with him? Would love some insight before I confront him.\n\ntl/dr: Wealthy friend made me pay half of the expensive dinner bill even though he invited me to the dinner and he knows what a financial burden it is for me to go out.

He is using you as a therapist instead of treating you as a friend.  You have enough  on your plate without this self centered guy wasting your time dumping his break up woes on you.  You will breathe a sigh of relief that you don\u2019t have to answer his messages anymore.  And don\u2019t fall for any apologies, he doesn\u2019t care about you, he will just be upset he lost his free therapist.  He is way too old to be acting like this.", "NTA\n\nHe invited you and said he owed you for all the support you've given him, what exactly was he treating you with? Gracing you with his presence??\n\nHe is absolutely the asshole.

You are so low in his eyes, you\u2019re not even worthy of a meal. Never, ever answer his calls again.", "NTA.  His being wealthy has nothing to do with it.  He invited you out and and said he \"owes\"  you so the expectation was that he was going to pay for the check.\n\nWhen you calm down, tell him how you felt blindsided and this was a lot of money for you.  See what he says.", "NTA because he said i owe you. Like how does splitting a bill say thank you for being there for me? But his wealth has nothing to do with it.", "NTA.\n\nTo me, it sounds like a situation in which you need to be putting boundaries in place...he shouldn't be sending you more than a hundred messages a day because his dating life is in turmoil. If he needs that level of support, he should be seeing a therapist.\n\nIt's really strange that he invited you out for dinner under the pretence of I owe you one, then didn't pay, but reading all of this this sounds like a man who ultimately associates financial transactions like this with sexual transactions. It sounds unhealthy as hell and I would be cutting him from my friendship circle.\n\nIt sounds like this is a friendship in which you're doing a lot of the heavy lifting.", "Not a friend. A taker. A user.\n\nNever take his call again", "NTA\n\nBy the heading, I assumed I\u2019d end up giving a different judgment.

He invited you out, he selected the place and price point. It was reasonable to expect him to pay the bill. But he didn\u2019t, instead he blindsides you.\n\nI would respond to him like this:\n\n*Unlike other women in your life - like the ones you date, I\u2019m not friends with you because of your money. However, this dinner you invited me to because you  \u201cowed me\u201d showed how little you appreciate my friendship. I sacrificed a lot of time to help you through a rough time. That\u2019s time from my kids and the little free time I have. But you matter so I did so. I spend $100 for a babysitter so you can take me out to dinner as a thank you. You then blindside me with a bill when I was your guest at a restaurant you picked. That\u2019s unacceptable. I didn\u2019t agree to pay for an expensive meal because that\u2019s not within my budget. If you want to split costs, then we need to do affordable or even free things together. But you want to do what you want regardless of what it costs me. You\u2019re not being a good friend and you actually abused our friendship in this situation.*\n\nEdit\n\nI had a male friend who often used me as a sounding board. I liked being a problem solver. It made me feel insightful and powerful. But then I realized that our interactions were all about him. A night of his complaints drained me. There was always something new to complain about with a lot of repeated issues. I started trying to talk about me more & my issues and interests. He verbally fought me on this. Once I realized that we weren\u2019t really friends, I was *his* counselor, I let the relationship go. You may be in the same situation.

How were you supposed to interpret it any other way? Plus, knowing your financial situation and you guys' difference in disposable income, he chose a nice restaurant.

He said he owes you for all the support you\u2019ve been giving him. Clearly he only thinks he has to pay for dinner if the person is going to sleep with him. That\u2019s gross.

I wanted to let you know that I am very hurt by how you treated me when we went for dinner. While I am/was under no illusions that this was any kind of a date situation, you invited me out for dinner because you said you \u201cowed\u201d me for all the support I gave you during your last breakup. That implied that the dinner was your treat. You pulled a bait and switch when the bill arrived. \n\nIf you had always intended this dinner to be an equal split, you should have made that clear at the moment of invitation, NOT after I accepted and you knew that I would also have to arrange/pay for a sitter for the evening. 100 dollars may be pocket change to you, but you know it is not to me.\n\nWhile you are correct that it wasn\u2019t a date and we\u2019re just friends, you seemed to have no issues blurring the lines between \u201cfriend\u201d and \u201ctherapist\u201d when you were busy sending me 100 texts a day whining about your breakup. I should send you a bill, but I won\u2019t.\n\nGoing forward, I am now drawing the lines. I am not your therapist, and we are no longer friends. The next time you need a shoulder to cry on, please message/call someone else, as I am now blocking your number and moving on with my life.\u201d\n\nThen immediately block before he can respond and try and spin things. \n\nI doubt this will change how this dude operates, but people like this also need to be called out once in a while to know that some people can see through the BS.", "NTA.

Your entire first couple of sentences and general attitude about his financial situation are gross, and your whole \"I don't judge\" is clearly disingenuous and implies the exact opposite . . . you absolutely judge him, you just know what it says about you, so you throw in the requisite, \"Of course he's allowed to spend the money that he earned the way he wants to.\" Um yeah, he is.\n\nOr, put more clearly: you're an AH because like so many people on this sub with friends in better financial circumstances, you don't seem to understand that *there aren't different social rules for how you treat friends - real friends - depending on how much money they have*. No one is a worse or better person because they were born with money, or have a really good job. And they don't owe it to others to spend their money on them just because they have more of it.

Venting, trauma dumping, whatever people call it, is toxic and to put that kind of load on someone just because you need to talk about it is not okay.

There are always major trust issues because they seriously cannot tell the difference between people just trying to mooch off of them versus those who want a genuine relationship.  Even people who are in their lives long term become worthy of suspicions, they may just be playing the long game.  I'm taking a guess here, but I am betting your friend wants to make it absolutely clear he is friends with you for 100% non monetary purposes and doesnt want to have to worry about losing yet another person he thought he trusted because they were after his money.\n\nIm going with NAH.  Sure him saying he \"owes\" you SHOULD mean he is treating you to dinner, but I think you need to take the entirety of the situation into account.

He\u2019s a very wealthy and successful guy, does very well for himself, and has no kids, never been married before, etc. He is a serial dater and his goal is to date the hottest girls he can. He spends sometimes thousands on them every week in buying them gifts, dinners, and straight up giving them cash.  It\u2019s his thing and one of the ways he likes to spend his money. Whatever floats his boat, his life, his money, I don\u2019t judge and if he\u2019s happy then I\u2019m happy for him. \n\nHowever, recently, he went through an awful breakup that sent him spiraling and I was there every day and night to talk to him on the phone, offer him advice, read his sometimes over a hundred messages a day and otherwise console him. We\u2019re talking hours every day that I was spending on him and it went on for weeks. Quite honestly, it was exhausting after awhile and there was definitely a lot of trauma dumping going on. I am a single mom who works full time and I don\u2019t always have a lot of free time or mental energy but I did my best to support him. He recently invited me out to dinner saying that he \u201cowes me\u201d for all of the support I\u2019ve given him, so we went out to a really nice restaurant and had a nice dinner, until the end.\n\nThe check arrived and he stated \u201cAlright, we\u2019re splitting this thing.\u201d I was shocked, as he wanted this dinner and invited me! When I questioned him and also informed him that I had to pay $100+ to a babysitter to be able to go out with him, he insisted that he\u2019s not paying for me, that we are just friends. I\u2019m able to support myself and my kids obviously but going out is a treat because of how costly everything gets, $100 is a lot for me.\n\nI sent him my half and left shortly after, somewhat upset, as I felt blindsided by this and also felt that he should\u2019ve treated, given the fact that he invited me and also because he makes exponentially more than me and knows my struggles sometimes as a single mom. AITA for being upset with him? Would love some insight before I confront him.\n\ntl/dr: Wealthy friend made me pay half of the expensive dinner bill even though he invited me to the dinner and he knows what a financial burden it is for me to go out.
