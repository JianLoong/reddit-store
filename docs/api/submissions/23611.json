What has she done to give you that impression? \n\nI get the sense she\u2019s had to become mature earlier than most due to her living situation. This has denied her a normal childhood like her friends since she had extra responsibilities.  She could cut loose and go wild, or she could dip her toe sensibly in the water.

From the reading it sounded like he was dead. Where the hell is your brother and why does he have the right to say you're a bad uncle when college and other financials should fall under his responsibility? And honestly, it doesn't matter what your reasoning is for not wanting to pay for your nieces out of state college, if you say you're not then you're not. It's her decision to either accept the offer for instate college coverage or not.", "NTA why are you responsible for her college?

You state that you don\u2019t want her having sex so if she stays living at home for college, she won\u2019t have sex. First of all, if she wants to have sex, she\u2019ll  find somewhere else to do it. Second, You are stifling her ability to grow and become a real person by keeping her in a home where she\u2019s a parent to her sibling. Do better.\n\n\nJust from reading this, my first notion is that she wants to get away from being a parent to her 5 year old sibling. \n\nShe\u2019s clearly being called LAZY on a consistent basis by SOMEONE\u2026\u2026 so is her mom telling her she\u2019s lazy because she\u2019s not picking up enough slack at home?\n\nThe fact that your mind went straight to her wanting to get away to be a crazy ho is a whole different issue here.\n\nIf she stays in state, she\u2019ll get pressured to live at home because her mom can\u2019t handle everything. Even if she does finagle living in a dorm, she\u2019s still too close and will be expected to be home every weekend. \n\nYou\u2019ve said nothing about her being a problem, kid, someone who is into drugs or sneaks out of the house, or has been in trouble with the law. What makes you think that her wanting to get away from her current situation means that she just wants to do bad things?\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s your money, and you can do whatever you want with it. But it sounds like you just don\u2019t want to pay the $80K, and not that you couldn\u2019t? Is that right? That if you agreed with her choices, paying for her to go to college wouldn\u2019t be an issue at all, you just don\u2019t want to? Which again, is your choice, but as a parental figure to her, if you could do some thing, that would help better, her life, why wouldn\u2019t you? \n\nYTA here", "Wow.  Way to call your niece a crazy slut.\n\nWhy on earth would Lola think she is lazy unless people are telling her that she is?  How much is she being parentified?

She called her dad and he started yelling at me calling me a horrible uncle.\n\nFunny, her dad, who should pay for her college is screaming at you for refusal to pay? Lola has to realize that in state college would be more affordable and she wouldn't have to pay for room and board. It's actually rude and entitled to expect someone who is not even your parent to pay for all this stuff. I feel like she is just tired helping with her autistic brother and with house chores, which is understandable but it's price of living at home for free.\n\nDid you ever promise her to pay for her out of state college? If yes - YTA because you are adult and have to expect all those issues long before, if no - NTA.", "YTA\n\nIf you can't afford 80k a year that's fine. But you think that Lola just wants to go drink, party and have sex. Lola has been nothing but responsible, even helps with the child care for her younger brother. You have no evidence to suggest that she wont continue to be responsible. \n\nThere is a chance that she just wants to be away from it all. She is used as a built in baby sitter and she probably doesn't want that to be her life. \n\nYour brother is her father and is alive and well. So why are you her father figure? I don't understand the dynamic.", "YTA\n\nYour niece wants to move away and be productive and motivated, and you've basically accused her of being a slut. WTF is wrong with you?", "NTA, but honestly\u2026if you were planning on supporting her (for whatever reason), why not just give her an amount (e.g. \u201cI\u2019ll pay up to\u2026\u201d). Then the in/out of state is something that she can decide on her own \n\nSounds like father is there real AH here, since tuition lands on uncle. My dad is planning to help support a couple nieces though college because he has the means and they don\u2019t, but they would never *expect* it. That is odd to me", "YTA. Not for the money, but for being so hung up on your nieces sex life. It\u2019s super creepy. Are you really surprised she wants to get away from you?", "YTA. It\u2019s not that 80k is too expensive for you because you said in comments that you\u2019d pay 80k if it was a school where she\u2019d live at home. It\u2019s that you want her nearby (presumably to keep caring for her brother) and you think that she won\u2019t have sex if she lives at home, which is hilarious. It\u2019s your money so do whatever but your niece is going to college to start her life as an adult and your reasons are keeping her from growing up, no matter where the college is.", "Why are you so involved when she has a Father? Also, if she stays in-state, you should encourage her to live on campus and not at home. In fact, a lot of colleges and universities don't allow Freshman to live off campus. But living on campus, in-state, might change her perspective as it seems that's what's driving the out-of-state idea.", "Tell Lola and your brother if they want her to go they'd better get to work to pay for it.

Get a fucking grip. \n\nThat being said, it is your money. You get to call the shots around how it\u2019s spent. Instead of shaming her for doing something WE ALL DO in college, take this opportunity to treat her like the adult.

She went overboard and failed. Teach your niece how to make good choices and to balance work, fun, and self care now while you can before she goes out in her own", "Are you serious?  You're incredibly naive.", "Oh, and I used to work in a university library. Students had sex in the library. We caught them in the stacks, in study rooms, in the bathrooms. Living  at home is not going to be the deterrent you think it is.", "So it\u2019s not that you object to an out of state college. \n\nYou are objecting to any college where she can\u2019t live at home.\n\nDude, the girl wants to stop being a caregiver to her brother. She wants the normal experience of living in a dorm and being independent.\n\nYou may be able to chain her to home for 4 more years, but don\u2019t be surprised if you don\u2019t see very much of her after that.", "One of my cousins used to sneak her bf into her parents\u2019 house while they were sleeping, have sex with him and sneak him back out before her parents woke up. My aunt and uncle didn\u2019t find out about it until she got pregnant. The point of the story is living with parents doesn\u2019t prevent a person from having sex.", "Honestly it's disgusting that you are actively thinking about and trying to police your niece's sex life\n Ew", "Loool, this guy is an idiot", "Why? It's his money, he can add conditions and the niece can reject them , and pay her own way", "His conditions come down to living somewhere he feels she is less likely to have a normal life (with, gasp, *sex* etc, as normal people of her age do). \n\nHe is a repressive perverted old creep trying to control a young woman entering their adulthood by threatening  withdrawing his money from her tuition.", "Yes, he can - but those conditions can also make him TA.", "You are one hundred percent right \ud83d\udc4d he is a pervert, and she should not take the money of such a creep.\nShe should stay away from him, and refuse to take his money."]}
