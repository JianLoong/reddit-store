What has she done to give you that impression? \n\nI get the sense she\u2019s had to become mature earlier than most due to her living situation. This has denied her a normal childhood like her friends since she had extra responsibilities.  She could cut loose and go wild, or she could dip her toe sensibly in the water.  Give her gentle guidance. \n\nShe wants to develop more skills to become an adult.

From the reading it sounded like he was dead. Where the hell is your brother and why does he have the right to say you're a bad uncle when college and other financials should fall under his responsibility? And honestly, it doesn't matter what your reasoning is for not wanting to pay for your nieces out of state college, if you say you're not then you're not. It's her decision to either accept the offer for instate college coverage or not.", "NTA why are you responsible for her college? Why is your brother upset that your not covering his daughters college?", "YTA based on answers below. \n\nOriginal request for I N F O: what exact words did you use when you said you weren\u2019t paying for her tuition?\n\nNormally I\u2019d say N T A for anything to do with expectations of money, but if it\u2019s something you would be willing to provide and you told them the reasons you\u2019ve shared here \u2026 YIKES.", "I\u2019m gonna say both. NTA for saying no, your $, you can do what you want. YTA for your assumptions. Good behavior doesn\u2019t stop at the state line.

You're also controlling AF and creepy as hell.", "YTA, it sounds like Lola has been forced to be the 3rd parent for her autistic sibling - Reddit sees a lot of that. Did it occur to you that she might want to enjoy her college years without being unpaid help for once? Instead of screaming, maybe compromise, there has to be an instate school far enough away, so she won't be available to \"help out\" all the time.", "INFO: Is there any in-state colleges far enough away to where it would be like going out of state(2ish hours+)?\n\nIf the answer is yes, then that may be a good compromise if it\u2019s somewhere she would want to go.

You state that you don\u2019t want her having sex so if she stays living at home for college, she won\u2019t have sex. First of all, if she wants to have sex, she\u2019ll  find somewhere else to do it. Second, You are stifling her ability to grow and become a real person by keeping her in a home where she\u2019s a parent to her sibling. Do better.\n\n\nJust from reading this, my first notion is that she wants to get away from being a parent to her 5 year old sibling. \n\nShe\u2019s clearly being called LAZY on a consistent basis by SOMEONE\u2026\u2026 so is her mom telling her she\u2019s lazy because she\u2019s not picking up enough slack at home?\n\nThe fact that your mind went straight to her wanting to get away to be a crazy ho is a whole different issue here.\n\nIf she stays in state, she\u2019ll get pressured to live at home because her mom can\u2019t handle everything. Even if she does finagle living in a dorm, she\u2019s still too close and will be expected to be home every weekend. \n\nYou\u2019ve said nothing about her being a problem, kid, someone who is into drugs or sneaks out of the house, or has been in trouble with the law. What makes you think that her wanting to get away from her current situation means that she just wants to do bad things?\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s your money, and you can do whatever you want with it. But it sounds like you just don\u2019t want to pay the $80K, and not that you couldn\u2019t? Is that right? That if you agreed with her choices, paying for her to go to college wouldn\u2019t be an issue at all, you just don\u2019t want to? Which again, is your choice, but as a parental figure to her, if you could do some thing, that would help better, her life, why wouldn\u2019t you? \n\nYTA here", "Wow.  Way to call your niece a crazy slut.\n\nWhy on earth would Lola think she is lazy unless people are telling her that she is?  How much is she being parentified?  Is she struggling trying to figure out who she is when she's not being a child caretaker of another child?\n\nMaybe she feels that she needs the distance from family to sort these things out.

She called her dad and he started yelling at me calling me a horrible uncle.\n\nFunny, her dad, who should pay for her college is screaming at you for refusal to pay? Lola has to realize that in state college would be more affordable and she wouldn't have to pay for room and board. It's actually rude and entitled to expect someone who is not even your parent to pay for all this stuff. I feel like she is just tired helping with her autistic brother and with house chores, which is understandable but it's price of living at home for free.\n\nDid you ever promise her to pay for her out of state college? If yes - YTA because you are adult and have to expect all those issues long before, if no - NTA.", "YTA\n\nIf you can't afford 80k a year that's fine. But you think that Lola just wants to go drink, party and have sex. Lola has been nothing but responsible, even helps with the child care for her younger brother. You have no evidence to suggest that she wont continue to be responsible. \n\nThere is a chance that she just wants to be away from it all. She is used as a built in baby sitter and she probably doesn't want that to be her life. \n\nYour brother is her father and is alive and well. So why are you her father figure? I don't understand the dynamic.", "YTA\n\nYour niece wants to move away and be productive and motivated, and you've basically accused her of being a slut. WTF is wrong with you?", "NTA, but honestly\u2026if you were planning on supporting her (for whatever reason), why not just give her an amount (e.g. \u201cI\u2019ll pay up to\u2026\u201d). Then the in/out of state is something that she can decide on her own \n\nSounds like father is there real AH here, since tuition lands on uncle. My dad is planning to help support a couple nieces though college because he has the means and they don\u2019t, but they would never *expect* it. That is odd to me", "YTA. Not for the money, but for being so hung up on your nieces sex life. It\u2019s super creepy. Are you really surprised she wants to get away from you?", "YTA. It\u2019s not that 80k is too expensive for you because you said in comments that you\u2019d pay 80k if it was a school where she\u2019d live at home. It\u2019s that you want her nearby (presumably to keep caring for her brother) and you think that she won\u2019t have sex if she lives at home, which is hilarious. It\u2019s your money so do whatever but your niece is going to college to start her life as an adult and your reasons are keeping her from growing up, no matter where the college is.", "Why are you so involved when she has a Father? Also, if she stays in-state, you should encourage her to live on campus and not at home. In fact, a lot of colleges and universities don't allow Freshman to live off campus. But living on campus, in-state, might change her perspective as it seems that's what's driving the out-of-state idea.", "Tell Lola and your brother if they want her to go they'd better get to work to pay for it. Lola's first lesson to not being lazy.", "Edit: based on your answers below, YTA. Massively. Can't imagine why you would say that to your niece.\n\n\n\nInfo: did you say what you think or did you only say that you will not be paying 80k?", ">and start participating in insane and inappropriate behaviors\n\nJust reading that alone made me think \"YTA\"", "~~NTA I\u2019m not sure why she thinks $80k/year is in your budget. ~~\n\nTell her how much you\u2019re willing to pay for school. She can get scholarships to cover the rest if she\u2019s smart enough. If she does get scholarships, she has to keep her GPA up to keep them. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t put in the work to get the scholarships, she can\u2019t go & you aren\u2019t the bad guy. \n\nIf she does earn scholarships, you don\u2019t have to worry about her screwing around too much bc she has to keep them.\n\nAs Lola is already 17, it\u2019s a little late to start setting her expectations about paying for college, but you guys really do need to figure it out.\n\nPlease underscore to her the pain of student loans. She shouldn\u2019t take out loans greater than her anticipated first year salary, and less is better.\n\nEDIT: Uncle is terrified his niece will have sex if she leaves the state for college. He apparently wants her to stay her mom\u2019s house through college, since no one has ever had sex while living with their mom. He\u2019s using the tuition money to control her, and it has nothing to do with the price of tuition or worry that she\u2019ll be a super party animal. \n\nYTA", "NTA - your reasoning is absolutely horrendous, what makes you think she won\u2019t fool around at home? Get a fucking grip. \n\nThat being said, it is your money. You get to call the shots around how it\u2019s spent. Instead of shaming her for doing something WE ALL DO in college, take this opportunity to treat her like the adult. Sit down with her and explain what your budget is for college, how you can afford dorms if she stays in state, and how you\u2019ll plan to support her at an arms length while she\u2019s still able to get the college experience. \n\nYou\u2019re gonna fumble a big learning opportunity to teach her the value of money and kindness.

Her character isn\u2019t location-dependent. Support her. Stop being an ass.", "As long as she lives with her mother, she\u2019s raising a 5 year old. \n\nHer childhood ended when she was 12. Let her have an adulthood.", "Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha. God, you\u2019re naive.", "Lol are you 40 or 80? Come on, man, nobody is that naive", "I find that really creepy and disturbing that you feel entitled to control your niece\u2019s sex life. YTA", "Pft. Keep dreamin' buddy.", "Wait, are you trying to keep her living at hope, where she is a parent?!?\n\nOP, Nooooooooooo\n\nIf you aren't going to get her out of being a defacto parent, then you're not the father figure you think you are. In fact, you're being a really lousy one.", "She can have sex in cars just fyi I had sex in college and lived with my mom and it was never at her house. You should come up with a compromise and let her have distance from home.", "Ah definitely YTA then. This isn't about money but control - you want to control her life. She's an adult soon, gonna have to get used to her making decisions you don't agree with", "most definitely. Lola mentioned it in her post she plans on going to a cheaper school & OP said some bs \u201cif she lived w her mom no sex will happen!\u201d", "Read the comments he wrote on Xenovore\u2019s comment", "\u201eFool around\u201c is not the same as having sex\u2026", "Did you read his comments? They\u2019re creepy as hell", "Sir, phrases can have mulitple meanings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.  \nNORTH AMERICAN  \nengage in sexual activity casually or with someone other than one's spouse or partner.", "nope, im answering to the post", "how should i know OP is from north america?", "He said in the comments he doesn\u2019t want her having sex. He says he believes if she has to live at her mothers she will continue to be a virgin.", "The states comment: \u201eLolas has brought to our attention that she plans on going out of state for college.\u201c"]}
