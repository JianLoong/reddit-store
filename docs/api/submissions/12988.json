She was trying to tell you that she loves you.\n\nWork sucks. You're allowed to be upset about that, and gripe to her, but what did you want her to do about it? She can't wave a wand and suddenly make your job great. Would you have felt better if she'd started telling you how her job sucks too? Or that this is it until you die? Just take the compliment.", "YTA. If she\u2019s picking you up from work you are not an independent adult. There is no reason to yell at her. Whatever your problems are in life, you mom being supportive is not the cause. Apologize to her.", "YES, YTA\u2026Based on your Mom\u2019s statement, you haven\u2019t worked full-time until this job that you \u201crecently started\u201d. You also haven\u2019t mentioned any full-time school. So, absolutely-you\u2019re way too old to be \u201cyelling at your mom\u201d (your words) just because she was KIND to you because finally took the steps that you should have taken LONG AGO, and may I add that your mom PICKED YOU UP from work too-something that she should only be doing if unusual circumstances are at play here. \n\nYou sound spoiled & entitled to me.", "YTA.  Your mom was acknowledging that you\u2019re in a tough situation and she\u2019s proud of you for sticking it out.  Were you were fishing for her to tell you to quit and that she would support you financially until you find a job you like?", "YTA.  Your mom was trying to find a way to be supportive and encouraging.  You shit on her when all she was doing was showing you love.  Welcome to adulting.  Not everyone can work in a job they absolutely love and sometimes you bide your time until something better comes along.  She could have told you to stop your crying and man up.  She could have, but she didn't.  Grow up.", "Yta here :/ your mom was being kind and you yelled at her and admit your reaction was unwarranted. Stress and anxiety are real here! Please take some time to find a therapist or mental health services to talk about this with.", "YTA \u2013 Our top story tonight, person hates job.  \n\nAre you serious?  Lots of people have jobs that they hate.  That's why they have to pay us.  And I am pretty certain that your mother at some point had a job she loathed as well.  She is still proud of you!  And you throw it in her face?  You absolute child. Go apologize.", "Oh yes, YTA. First, I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t like your job; that must be frustrating as hell. That aside, you should consider yourself lucky that (a) mom was around to pick you up; and (b) you have 2 parents that love and support you.

It\u2019s a form of \u201cI don\u2019t care what you think or feel towards me\u201d, which is a rude thing to say to someone. Even if it\u2019s true, and you want to cut your mom out of your life. \n\nYTA", "YTA, she wasn't telling you to stick with a job you don't like. She also isn't responsible for you taking this job, you're an adult, that was ultimately your decision. She was just trying to console you and you blew up at her.", "YTA\n\nYou sound very childish. Your mum said she's proud of you for joining the workforce.. you're 21 acting like an immature 16 year old whose just been forced to get a job. You clearly still live with your parents, and even have your parents pick you up from work and you still treated your mum like crap. It's time to grow up. It's time to appreciate that even if a job is the shittiest job in the world, it's a job, and it's better than nothing, and to keep looking for something better.\n\nHaving proud and supportive and understanding parents SHOULD make your life a bit better, a bit easier.

I don't need her praise, but it feels good. Yet considering all the horrible parents of kids on Reddit, finally we get a really good mom yet you \"don't give a shit\". \n\nI assume that you are just stressed and said that without thinking, so you can just apologize and give her a hug. She probably won't hold a grudge against you for it. But you were being an asshole for sure.", "YTA, and the fact you need a POST to know it says a lot. Sometimes just a simple \u201cthanks mom\u201d goes a long way, even if you don\u2019t mean it completely.

Your mother only wants the best for you, and I think she was only trying to be kind.

You probably think of yourself as more grown and mature than you actually are (as most young 20 year olds do). Get ready because almost every job is exhausting and annoying. You would be very lucky to find a job that wasn\u2019t. Your mom sounds like a sweet and caring parent you are lucky to have and that you should be eager to have be proud of you. \n\nAlso lots of people have to do those exhausting and annoying jobs and then have to take public transit home in over an hour commutes so having someone willing to pick you up is a great relief you should be more grateful for.", "YTA\n\nShe was trying to comfort you and you're being ungrateful at her effort.", "YTA, parents are going to be proud of their children's achievements.

She's just happy that you've gotten into a full time job successfully, which at this time isn't the easiest thing to do. \n\nThen you threw it in her face, and told her that her being proud of you means nothing to you. I'm not even a parent but that would have crushed me.", "YTA. \n\nNothing your mother can say will solve your problem for you. All she can do is offer encouragement, and make sure you know that she loves you and is proud of you. That's not offensive: it's kind. \n\nGo apologize to your mom. Hopefully you can be proud that you have a mom who loves you as much as she does.", "Your poor Mum. It seems like she was just trying to be nice and make you feel better (in a weird Mum kind of way).

But your mom just told you... that no matter what... she is proud you tried. And you yell at her in return ?!\n\nYou should be glad she didn't try to shame you into staying in your current job or yell at your that you are entitled and should suck it up.

That\u2019s why it\u2019s called work.\n\nSecond, mom was trying to be encouraging and complimentary. It is discouraging for her, I\u2019m quite sure, that her being proud means Jack shit to you.

She was just being supportive. \n\nGo apologize.", "YTA - This was your frustrations boiling over in a moment where you can't see that she was just being loving and that you'll do the right thing and apologize, right??

Your mom wants what's best for you, but sometimes what she *thinks* is best for you is way different from what's *actually* best for you. Moms are like that.\n\nOverall, I think there are some communication issues that need to be worked out.

You will deeply regret this behavior when you get older. \n\nShe can't change your current job, she did the only thing she could to alleviate some of your stress, by giving you her love. Work sucks for everyone, sure you can find something better, but you will need to find a way to cope with a bad day at work because they are just a fact of life. Snapping at your mother is no way to react in this situation. It's also a behavior you'll need to get in check before you have a spouse and/or children (if you want a spouse/child). \n\nI also highly recommend getting your own vehicle as soon as you can, it'll allow you much more personal freedom and more space to deal with stuff. I can't tell you how many times I've just gone and sat in my car for a while just to listen to music/cry/yell/generally blow off steam. \n\nThis is your first job I gather?

We could organize a support group, but you\u2019d be the only one in it obviously. Maybe we could throw together a telethon? Some sort of gofundme? It must be SO HARD to have to do something that\u2019s exhausting and annoying and thankless. Your mother couldn\u2019t possibly understand what that\u2019s like. Wtf dude. YTA.", "YTA. \nI understand you were under a lot of pressure and you exploded. We are human, after all. \n\nYou should apologize to her.", "Info: has any of your parents' behavior while you were growing up warranted your apathy towards their support?\n\nI ask because I can imagine certain types of upbringing (by emotionally negligent or abusive parents) leading to this being a justifiable reaction.", "So this is your first job and your mom has to pick you up from work? And then you yell at her when she tries to comfort you? \n\nYTA and you sound like a NEET. Dude, look in the mirror and get real. You sound pathetic.", "YTA. I don't see any reason why she should actually be proud of you.  You are a mean little shit.", "YTA and you should apologize.\n\nHating your job is fine\n\nBeing annoyed is fine\n\nYelling at your mum because you hate your job is not fine but is human.\n\nNot apologizing for it and thinking this is somehow her fault for trying to be kind and supportive is an AH move.", "YTA\n\nYou sound like someone who has never lifter a finger in your life and just learned that work and responsibilities are hard.", "You sound very immature YTA", "YTA. Go hug your mom, dude.", "YTA\n\nIf anything she was trying to be supportive of what you do now AND what you\u2019re going to do next. You owe her an apology.", "YTA.  Mom\u2019s deserve to express this.  You deserve kick in your head.", "YTA - she's just trying to be encouraging, especially since you are a bit late in joining the functional adult population.  From my perspective, if you are 21 and aren't currently a full time student, then having a full time job is just meeting expectations of adulthood.", "YTA", "YTA. She's not telling you she's proud of you to try and convince you to like your job. She's telling you she's proud of you because... She's proud of you! Try being a bit kinder and appreciate the sentiment. You can still communicate your feelings. \"I appreciate you trying to make me feel better, mum, I'm just having a tough time with this job right now.\"", "YTA. You have a job you don't like. Welcome to being an adult. Keep working that job until you can find a better one. Your mother offers you praise for handling adult responsibilities and you tell her you don't care what she thinks. Don't bite the hand that feeds you. Would you prefer that she say she's ashamed of you for having a crappy job? She's not telling you that your job is great or that it's the best you can get. She's just saying she's proud of you for handling adult responsibilities well - she's offering encouragement. You've told her that no, you're not handing adult responsibilities well at all.", "Wow. Just wow. She\u2019s trying to be supportive and you\u2019re acting like a brat. Maybe you\u2019re not happy at work because your attitude just sucks in general. I would have loved a mom who was supportive of me when I was your age. It goes a long way and you don\u2019t seem to understand that and take it for granted. YTA.", "YTA. Time to grow up, OP.", "YTA.  Most people don't like their jobs. Stick with it and aggressively work to find another. Don't take it out on your family.", "God damn atleast your mother tells you she\u2019s proud of you. That\u2019s more than a lot of mothers do. YTA", "Some people have never heard their mother say she\u2019s proud of them. Your mother clearly loves you a lot. I think when you\u2019re older you\u2019ll look back and wish you\u2019d appreciated her more.", "Grow up. You\u2019re annoyed you can\u2019t spend your days playing video games out of your moms basement? Your mom is helping you out to become an adult. Buy her some flowers and apologoze", "YTA. Would you have preferred she said \u201csuck it up, buttercup?\u201d Because that\u2019s what many parents would say.", "YTA.  Being a mother is often a thankless job and this right here is a prime example.  She wasn't trying to solve your problem; she was trying to love you.  Do you really NOT know that YTA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Welcome to adulthood kid...it's not all fucking sunshine and rainbows and you're in for a rough life if this is how you handle stress and bad times.", "I\u2019m just a stranger on the internet so I don\u2019t know what the relationship was like prior to this incident but based on the information given in the post, the mother didn\u2019t do or say anything wrong. It would be different if the mother had been making the OP feel like garbage his entire life but that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on here. The mother is just trying to be supportive. \n\nSo OP I\u2019ll have to give you a YTA score. I have no right to talk about not yelling at your mom because I myself have a very complicated relationship with mine and I\u2019ve said some very uncharitable things to her in my time but I do think you were in the wrong here and should apologize. \n\nGood luck finding a job you actually like OP", "My heart would definitely get bruised up if my daughter pulled this when I was just trying to be encouraging.\nGo apologize now. That was pretty fucking mean.\n\nIn this particular case, YTA.", "YTA. You are an adult and your mom doesn\u2019t need to understand anything or do anything for you or have anything to do with you. Be grateful she is helpful and supportive. Do better.", "YTA.\n\nCalm down there, Cartman.", "YTA - apologise to your mom ffs, she was trying to be nice and comfort you. Is it only her you talk to in that way? You need to sort that shit out", "YTA. When you grow up this will be a moment you regret. I recommend doing it quickly. At 21 you\u2019re too old to be acting like this because life\u2019s a little uncomfortable.", "YTA. Welcome to being an adult. Many adults hate their jobs, but they don't yell at their parent because of it.  Apologize to your mom and suck it up until you can find a new job.  Your carefree childhood days are over, accept it.", "YTA you were nasty, rude and disrespectful to your mom. It\u2019s obvious you\u2019re a brat and your parents have allowed this. I would rip out my vocal cords before speaking to my mom like that. You probably hate your job because you\u2019re not allowed to disrespect people there like you do at home. You\u2019re in for a rude life awakening.", "Good job pushing away the only person who is proud of you for doing the absolute bare minimum. YTA", "If you ever have kids, one day you'll find yourself looking at them and just bursting with pride and love. In that moment, think back to this exchange.", "YTA.  Grow up. Don't attack ur mom bcz u hate ur job.", "YTA. Your job can suck AND your mom can be proud of you", "YTA. You vented your frustration to your mom, your mom tried to make you feel better and you took out your day on her. Absolutely an ah move", "YTA. You are 21 god damn years old and you're still lashing out at your mom for trying to be supportive? Sorry, that is solidly in 14-16 year old territory. What's more is that, as a mom myself, I would have had to physically restrain myself from pulling over and making your full on adult self walk home and your mom just kept on driving. You are very privileged and don't even know it.", "YTA. So many issues here, where to start. First, you\u2019re Mom loves you and told you that she\u2019s proud of you and your response was to yell at her and be cruel to her. Not only that she took time out of her day to pick you up from your job. She was telling you she\u2019s proud of your perseverance, for sticking You\u2019re in for a reality check. Second, this is probably not going to be the last job you loath. A big part of being an adult is doing things you don\u2019t care for including work. You also need to realize that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you. Third, wait until you start paying your own bills, have rent a mortgage, car payments. Once you stop living off of Mommy and Daddy reality is really going to hit you square in the face. Also, you\u2019re probably not at the top of the candidate list for other companies since you have very little experience. \nSuck it up buttercup.", "Take the compliment and apologize to your mother, OP. You\u2019re allowed to be frustrated about your job, but yelling at your mother (who has nothing to do with your job being bad) isn\u2019t okay.", "Yes, OP needs to understand that he can have feelings and still be mindful of the feelings of another person. This is a mindset he\u2019ll need for relationships for his whole life. Even if his mom\u2019s kindness didn\u2019t help him in that moment, he should be able to understand she was trying to help and act accordingly. How hard is it to just say \u201cthanks, Mom\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s awful to see someone you love suffering and have no idea how to help. If he wanted something different from his mom, he could have told her (nicely) what that was. She\u2019s not going to be able to fix his problem for him though, so I\u2019m not sure what OP is expecting.", "My guess is she is tired of him living in her basement. Because he gives off **that** vibe, if you know what I mean.", "Maybe she's proud of OP bc OP lives at home with mom and dad and doesn't have a vehicle. Work sucks, but sometimes it's a step in the right direction even if it's temporarily uncomfortable.", "Why is he 21 and his MOM is picking him up from work? And at 21 he just now got his first job?", "Note ' car ride home ' - sounds like he lives at home still too. So mommy picks him up, he lives at home and he thanks her by shouting at her. Nice. \n\nI don't judge people for living at home - it's expensive and damn hard to live on your own, so not bashing anyone. But OP sounds just a little entitled ...", "good point, I didn't even catch that.  Which also means he lives at home.", "Sounds like he wants to be the thirty year old living in moms basement demanding chicken tendies.", "That\u2019s a very good question. It does sort of read that way.", "At least trying to make her feel sorry she prompted him to apply for the job.", "this is exactly what he was doing.", "I enjoy my job and I still don\u2019t love work. It\u2019s all part of life kid, OP needs a wake up call and to apologize to mom. Definitely YTA.", "Definitely read like a 15 year old leaving their first shift at Panera bread. No", "Ahh the British version of AITA. The only thing missing in your statement is calling OP a wanker. Sorry. I watch too many Guy Ritchie films.", "Okay so I'm not the only one who read this that way. I'm sitting here struggling to find what part of what mom said was *wrong*... what the heck", "YTA. Apologizing would go a long way in making yourself feel better too, imo.", "Yeah if I was his mother he'd be catching the bus.", "I get the impression that he was forced into the job after failing to launch, hence the teenage reaction to an adult problem - and Mommy & Daddy still trying to coddle him along. \n\nOP needs to grow up, because if he displays that attitude at work he won\u2019t need to worry about how exhausting and annoying it is for long.", "OP is definitely the AH here but, school? 21 would be a pretty standard age for someone to enter the workforce after a 4yr degree program.", "op's completely in the wrong but complaining about work is normal, as long as it's not constant. it's healthy to vent about stressful things every once in a while, just minus the yelling at his mother part", "? Complaining about work is normal. Wtf are you on about.", "where do microaggressions come into this?", "TIL being supportive and proud of your kid is invalidating", "She encouraged him to apply, OP is an adult, if he didn\u2019t want to apply, he didn\u2019t have to, if he didn\u2019t want to accept the job, he didn\u2019t have to.\n\nOP sounds immature, I bet he is the type of person who thinks they work the hardest and are the best employee, it\u2019s everyone else who is the problem. \n\nDude needs to do some self-reflection and grow up.", "Mother is certainly not the asshole for making him get a job. Since he can\u2019t seem to find another one, this is the one he will need to stick with until he does.", "There is literally no basis for any of this in the post. Comments like this are the reason AITA has such an unhinged reputation", "I agree wholeheartedly and typically have no sympathy for people like this, but considering a pandemic had just started when he was 18, and it also sounds like this is an in-person job, he may not have really had an opportunity to fully support himself just yet. I still think he\u2019s TA for his attitude toward his mom.", "Fully joining the workforce sounds like only PT jobs before.", "If you don\u2019t need the money and are in school till then why would you get a job before that?", "My guess is he is from a certain demographic that is known for wearing fedoras and collecting swords while living in their parents' basement.", "[Until he gets arrested for posting threats on 4chan](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7ewbm/sheriff-mike-chitwood-death-threats-4chan-arrest-richard-golden)\n\nThis is OP\u2019s future if he\u2019s not careful.", "And then 40, and so on.....", "\u261d\ud83c\udffb", "By all means, allow me.\n\nOP is a bloody wanker.\n\nAnd also, YTA.", "I lived in Australia when I was 16 and have used wanker religiously evr since \ud83e\udd23", "[removed]", "I got those vibes as well\u2026 maybe didn\u2019t do post secondary education and parents are telling him to get a job and he\u2019s hostile that he can\u2019t get a wonderful job with only a high school education", "I thought that too, but surely he wouldn\u2019t be this immature and ungrateful at 21 after a college education?", "We found the boomer", "Thanks for pointing that out, it was a typo, I meant passive aggressions.
