She was trying to tell you that she loves you.\n\nWork sucks. You're allowed to be upset about that, and gripe to her, but what did you want her to do about it? She can't wave a wand and suddenly make your job great. Would you have felt better if she'd started telling you how her job sucks too? Or that this is it until you die? Just take the compliment.", "YTA. If she\u2019s picking you up from work you are not an independent adult. There is no reason to yell at her. Whatever your problems are in life, your mom being supportive is not the cause. Apologize to her.", "YES, YTA\u2026Based on your Mom\u2019s statement, you haven\u2019t worked full-time until this job that you \u201crecently started\u201d. You also haven\u2019t mentioned any full-time school. So, absolutely-you\u2019re way too old to be \u201cyelling at your mom\u201d (your words) just because she was KIND to you because finally took the steps that you should have taken LONG AGO, and may I add that your mom PICKED YOU UP from work too-something that she should only be doing if unusual circumstances are at play here. \n\nYou sound spoiled & entitled to me.", "YTA.  Your mom was acknowledging that you\u2019re in a tough situation and she\u2019s proud of you for sticking it out.  Were you were fishing for her to tell you to quit and that she would support you financially until you find a job you like?", "YTA.  Your mom was trying to find a way to be supportive and encouraging.  You shit on her when all she was doing was showing you love.  Welcome to adulting.  Not everyone can work in a job they absolutely love and sometimes you bide your time until something better comes along.  She could have told you to stop your crying and man up.  She could have, but she didn't.  Grow up.", "Yta here :/ your mom was being kind and you yelled at her and admit your reaction was unwarranted. Stress and anxiety are real here! Please take some time to find a therapist or mental health services to talk about this with.", "YTA \u2013 Our top story tonight, person hates job.  \n\nAre you serious?  Lots of people have jobs that they hate.  That's why they have to pay us.  And I am pretty certain that your mother at some point had a job she loathed as well.  She is still proud of you!  And you throw it in her face?  You absolute child. Go apologize.", "Oh yes, YTA. First, I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t like your job; that must be frustrating as hell. That aside, you should consider yourself lucky that (a) mom was around to pick you up; and (b) you have 2 parents that love and support you.

It\u2019s a form of \u201cI don\u2019t care what you think or feel towards me\u201d, which is a rude thing to say to someone. Even if it\u2019s true, and you want to cut your mom out of your life. \n\nYTA", "YTA, she wasn't telling you to stick with a job you don't like. She also isn't responsible for you taking this job, you're an adult, that was ultimately your decision. She was just trying to console you and you blew up at her.", "YTA\n\nYou sound very childish. Your mum said she's proud of you for joining the workforce.. you're 21 acting like an immature 16 year old whose just been forced to get a job. You clearly still live with your parents, and even have your parents pick you up from work and you still treated your mum like crap. It's time to grow up. It's time to appreciate that even if a job is the shittiest job in the world, it's a job, and it's better than nothing, and to keep looking for something better.\n\nHaving proud and supportive and understanding parents SHOULD make your life a bit better, a bit easier.

I don't need her praise, but it feels good. Yet considering all the horrible parents of kids on Reddit, finally we get a really good mom yet you \"don't give a shit\". \n\nI assume that you are just stressed and said that without thinking, so you can just apologize and give her a hug. She probably won't hold a grudge against you for it. But you were being an asshole for sure.", "YTA, and the fact you need a POST to know it says a lot. Sometimes just a simple \u201cthanks mom\u201d goes a long way, even if you don\u2019t mean it completely.

Your mother only wants the best for you, and I think she was only trying to be kind.

You probably think of yourself as more grown and mature than you actually are (as most young 20 year olds do). Get ready because almost every job is exhausting and annoying. You would be very lucky to find a job that wasn\u2019t. Your mom sounds like a sweet and caring parent you are lucky to have and that you should be eager to have be proud of you. \n\nAlso lots of people have to do those exhausting and annoying jobs and then have to take public transit home in over an hour commutes so having someone willing to pick you up is a great relief you should be more grateful for.", "YTA\n\nShe was trying to comfort you and you're being ungrateful at her effort.", "YTA, parents are going to be proud of their children's achievements.

She's just happy that you've gotten into a full time job successfully, which at this time isn't the easiest thing to do. \n\nThen you threw it in her face, and told her that her being proud of you means nothing to you. I'm not even a parent but that would have crushed me.", "YTA. \n\nNothing your mother can say will solve your problem for you. All she can do is offer encouragement, and make sure you know that she loves you and is proud of you. That's not offensive: it's kind. \n\nGo apologize to your mom. Hopefully you can be proud that you have a mom who loves you as much as she does.", "Your poor Mum. It seems like she was just trying to be nice and make you feel better (in a weird Mum kind of way).

But your mom just told you... that no matter what... she is proud you tried. And you yell at her in return ?!\n\nYou should be glad she didn't try to shame you into staying in your current job or yell at your that you are entitled and should suck it up.

That\u2019s why it\u2019s called work.\n\nSecond, mom was trying to be encouraging and complimentary. It is discouraging for her, I\u2019m quite sure, that her being proud means Jack shit to you.

She was just being supportive. \n\nGo apologize.", "YTA - This was your frustrations boiling over in a moment where you can't see that she was just being loving and that you'll do the right thing and apologize, right??

You will deeply regret this behavior when you get older. \n\nShe can't change your current job, she did the only thing she could to alleviate some of your stress, by giving you her love. Work sucks for everyone, sure you can find something better, but you will need to find a way to cope with a bad day at work because they are just a fact of life. Snapping at your mother is no way to react in this situation. It's also a behavior you'll need to get in check before you have a spouse and/or children (if you want a spouse/child). \n\nI also highly recommend getting your own vehicle as soon as you can, it'll allow you much more personal freedom and more space to deal with stuff.

You might explain that you just wanted her to listen. And instead it felt like she was invalidating your struggles, that combined with the stress from work, is why you went off. But that you were still wrong to do so and you're sorry.\n\nAnd you should also buy her flowers or some new earrings with your paycheck. Seriously, she deserves it.", "What if, and hear me out here, she was just fucking proud of you and wasn\u2019t actually trying to make you feel better? Life is hard, work sucks and being an adult is always exhausting no matter what you\u2019re doing. She\u2019s proud of you for doing it, period. \n\nAnd honestly, coming from a mom, if your first full-time job didn\u2019t happen until you were 21\u2026 unless there are extenuating circumstances, I\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t follow it up with \u201cabout damn time\u201d. \n\nFurthermore, I\u2019m going to assume that since you haven\u2019t really worked enough to be able to support yourself yet, she\u2019s been supporting you all this time, yeah? You yelled at her for being supportive when she\u2019s done nothing but help and support you while you were doing whatever else other than working. YTA here, no question. Not sorry.", "Shut up and work. YTA. Boo hoo you don\u2019t have your dream job at 21\u2026welcome to the fuckin show!", "YTA. When my mom said something similar when I was 23 in a very similar situation, I hugged her. What did you expect your mom to be able to do? She was grasping at straws, and trying to reassure you. She was trying to validate your struggles by saying she was proud of you for making it as far as you did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd you shouted at her. Good job, bud. You made your mom feel like shit when she was just trying her best to help.", "YTA. she acknowledged that this is hard, you are doing something hard but she's proud of you.  Chill the eff out", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA and you\u2019ll understand if you have kids one day. My oldest is 6 and my heart would be broken if he said that to me after expressing how proud I am of him.", ">yelling at mom was a bit extreme\n\nOf course YTA!  If I had a kid as ungrateful as you, I sure wouldn\u2019t be wasting my day picking up his 21 yo ass at his job that he\u2019s apparently too immature and irresponsible to deal with on a daily basis. \n\nClearly, there\u2019s a bigger issue here than hating your job (lots of us go through that and don\u2019t take it out on other people that care for us) and you should probably talk to someone and figure out what it is instead of beating up your mom, albeit verbally.", "YTA, you very clearly have support and are such an angry person you can't see it. Quit. Don't quit. Who gives a damn dude. But disrespecting your mother when she's going out of her way for you and expressing her pride she has in you? Thats a low that would drive lots of families apart. Go to therapy, read a book. Or just don't play LOL. But don't talk to anyone like that, let alone your mom.", "YTA. Your mom is **picking you up from work** and trying to help you find a light in a dark time. You should be so lucky to have a mom like that.", "YTA. Yelling at her was extreme. You were tired and cranky, working a job she encouraged you to apply for, that you hate, but you were in the wrong. Apparently, you are 21, carless, probably living in her home as you were being driven home from work by your mother. Her saying she was proud of you for being a full-time worker, probably instead of living off her if I am reading between the lines correctly, did not warrant you yelling at her even if you hate the job. At the very least, it sounds like you are no longer being a complete leech. If you want to be treated like an adult, until you get the job you want, you need to keep working the job you have, and be decent to her. Not yell at her because you are having to have a real job for real pay!", "YTA/ESH - It can be very frustrating when you\u2019re trying to explain your frustrations to your mom they tell you \u201chow great it is that this thing you hate is happening\u201d, but you shouldn\u2019t have yelled at your mom over it. She was trying to be supportive, though not in the way you wanted/needed.\n\nSounds like you were frustrated and reached a boiling point and snapped a bit. She deserves an apology for that.", "You both kind of suck.\n\nYou shouldn't yell at your mum for (what seems) like a supporting statement, something that might cheer you up. HOWEVER I think there's a time and a place and it seems like her statement was overriding your unhappiness and how you were expressing it.   \nA good chat, and an apology for HOW you expressed yourself are probably the way to go.", "ESH.  \nHer comment strikes me as passive-aggressive and I hate that.  \nYou sound like you've been a leech on your parents for the last 3 years and, while I'm not in a position to hate that, I'll bet they do.  \n\n\nYou should be happy that they still support you and chauffer you about. Many families would have tossed you on the street 3 years ago.", "My son is 15 and cleans and sells high dollar sneakers. I have a 22 year old who is lazy af but he\u2019s never been mean to me\u2026it would break my heart.", "On it's own, there's nothing inherently wrong with that.  People have different means and he might not be able to afford a car and whatnot.  That's fine.  But add in the rest of the story.... yeeesh, that really gives off a \"kid who refuses to grow up\" vibe.\n\nHeck, I'd be very understanding of the situation if the OP had posted this story in TIFU and was acknowledging that he let the stress and emotions get the better of him and he wrongly took it out on his mom.", "21,  mommy's picking him up from his first grownup job and he craps all over her. What a jerk", ">I am pretty certain that your mother at some point had a job she loathed as well.\n\nI'm pretty certain mom doesn't love the job of carting OP to and from work. She probably loves it a lot less when she's getting yelled and cursed at.", "Honestly if he gets this mad when someone compliments him just IMAGINE what he\u2019d be like if someone insulted him.", "He literally just graduated from college. He was an ass to his mom but let\u2019s not start with the \u201cliving in his parents basement\u201d trope. The world is rough right now, people should be able to lean on their parents if they need to without judgement. He just needs to apologize.", "The second I read that his mum came and picked him up after work, I was thinking, ok, so not only is he ungrateful for a supportive parent, he's also not factoring in the roof over his head and free transportation. That's not to say if he's just now getting a job, that means all his other living expenses are covered, too (and we all know how much food costs now a'days).\n\nMassive YTA OP. You're more than welcome to vent, and it's super common to hate your job. Do you really think all of us are getting up every day and just *skipping with glee* off to our jobs? Please, a small reality check is in order. Apologize to your mother, she was literally only trying to make you feel better. I am in my 30s and it still makes my day when my mum says she's proud of me, and I've been on my own since 18. Realize that her saying that wasn't trying to rub anything in your face, it was just an act of love. Please apologize, learn from this, and practice gratitude when you can.", "HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA \n\nI bet you are right!", "Right?? Like is it really a bad job or is he just pissed off because he actually needs to get his ass now?", "Yes - this is a \"for the love of fucking god, don't quit this one too, because we need you out of our fucking house. You've been sucking us dry for 21 years and it needs to end. \n\nThen his Emo reply solidified this - and she heard her husband's voice saying; \"I don't give a shit anymore, he's not turning 22 under this roof, he's out of here in the next two months or I am\"", "Yeppp she\u2019s *so glad* he\u2019s *joined the workforce*. At 21.", "It\u2019s one of the most infuriating things about this website. So many people make snide comments like that about people in their early 20s living at home", "No, but I am judging OP for living at home for 3 years and just now getting a job, and being such a huge baby about everything.", "\u201cHis postings were anonymous. Everything is anonymous. They don't want to be identified,\u201d said Chitwood before holding up a picture of Golden. \u201cI guess if I looked like this, I wouldn't want to be identified either. Being 38 years old and living in my mother's back bedroom with no job.\u201c\n\nLmaoooo", "Which makes him more of an AH, because a 21 yo shouldnt have to be told to get off his butt and get a job.", "Please- no way in hell that OP wasn't utterly resistant to getting off his behind- you have to know mom begged, pleaded, and pulled strings to get Jr. to get off his behind and away from his video game console.", "Well I'll just sit in this old lady corner remembering how I turned 18 in 2009 \ud83e\udd72 and these guys have been around  since then.", "But the statements are general. There is this weird trend lately here on reddit where when people justifiably dont like one thing about OP, they go on full outrage on pretty normal inoffensive things OP have done too. There is nothing shameful to live with parents at 21. Nothing shameful for being driven by someone else in a car, especially if you did not had job long enough to buy own car. \n\nOP was rude when talking to mom ... that should be enough for judgement. No reason to make outrage from living at home.", "I\u2019d also like to know if mom pushed him toward this particular job when he had other options, or pushed him to get *a* job.", "Boomers or teens playing pretend. That\u2019s what most of this sub is.", "It's also not like it's uncommon for a family to not be able to afford to have and maintain 3 vehicles. Parents can only afford two vehicles, someone is going to be picked up from work.", "r/usernamechecksout\n\nCool story bro, I don\u2019t know who you hang out with but I don\u2019t know a single person who didn\u2019t get their license after 25. See, I can do that too, still doesn't mean either of our expriences are the norm.", "That\u2019s wild. I can\u2019t imagine the audacity someone needs in order to be able to just go up look a professor straight in the eyes and say that while being 100% serious.", "I completely understand what you were saying. My oldest had to start the whole \"becoming a functioning member of society as an adult\" thing just as the pandemic restrictions were lifting and things were returning to \"normal\" and it was *difficult* to say the least. The first 2 jobs were disastrous and we got lucky in that his father is pretty high up in his union and runs the shop he's been at for 20+ yrs so when a \"helper\" position opened up dad could get him in. I can't imagine how long and hard the road would have been otherwise. I genuinely feel for the \"kids\" (really, they're young adults, but anyone who has older kids or has even ever met a 18-29 yr old knows...lol) who are dealing with this right now. They've been handed a tremendously shit deal. But yeah, his absolutely repugnant, trashy, bratty, and entitled reaction to his mother is so incredibly shitty and I would hope, not f*cking tolerated by either parent. Employment sucks, welcome to the adult world where you are *always* doing shit you don't wanna do, working jobs you don't like, running errands, doing laundry/household chores instead of going to the beach on your day off, eating the food at home even though you want taco bell because it's either pay rent or buy fast food when you have to pay your own way.....better be nice to mom otherwise he's gonna be on his own, having to grow up and do all this shit much quicker than he'd like lol", "he's just now getting a 'real' job.\n\nThat gives him NO excuse for having no manners. Especially to the only people trying to help him out.", "Why is that bad? Some people don\u2019t have the option of public transportation or even the money to afford a car, even if they can drive it. That\u2019s not a mark on their character, that\u2019s just North America being shitty about transportation.", "Exactly. Very boomer takes about him living at home. Which is ironic as hell considering these are Redditors", "The person you\u2019re responding to is saying exactly that.  Just adding that it seems reasonable to have been delayed in the process of independence.", "Do you not think empathy is involved in justifying enabling behavior? Empathy isn\u2019t always a positive.", "I agree the tone is horrible. It\u2019s so bad that it\u2019s completely unnecessary to assume things, or make them up.", "Obviously, he's an asshole for yelling at his mother like that, but we're talking about how there's nothing wrong with being driven to and from work by your mother at 21 and has no bearing on whether or not OP is an asshole or not, its just people trying to shame him for every minute detail when it isnt relevant at all to whether or not he's an asshole.\n\nHe'd still be an asshole if he said that anywhere else.", "It is not even delayed. Living with parents at 21 is fairly normal.", "Same. My first corporate job, I had no license and no car. So I commuted two hours a day, bus to bus then walked 2 miles, half uphill. Just so I could save money to buy a car in cash when I got my license. It was hard and I wish my mom could had just driven me. I really appreciate the coworkers and my husband then boyfriend for driving me when they could", "And I don't drive and worked 3 jobs including a full time third shift one as one of them all while attending law school to put myself through it. That shits hard sure but that's life...It's Great you can do that for him. But that's a giant fucking privilege and a nice thing a kid should recognize. When I'm home and my parents do give me rides it's awesome.  I can be a stressed anxious jerk and vent and rage but also appreciate that they're doing something for me and that's nice. And if they just try by telling me one nice comment when I constantly am using them as an emotional punching bag I sure as hell don't have the audacity to chew them out . \n\nYeah that shits an adjustment but your grandkid should appreciate what you're doing still...like jeez", "Labor work to me is what I did in early 20s. Asbestos removal. Loading and unloading 18 wheelers full of plants/bags of rocks/mulch etc. by hand. Carrying sheet rock all day. That to me is labor work maybe I should have classified it as heavy labor work."]}
