And she should be understanding that you came home late last night and were hungry, and it's not like you would've had the energy to make something. And it's not that hard to throw a sandwich together or maybe just this once she could've gotten lunch from outside.", "This one depends very much on what the norms of your household are.  When I lived with my parents, the rule was that you didn\u2019t eat someone else\u2019s restaurant leftovers without asking unless they were at least 2 days old, but home cooked leftovers were fair game unless someone clearly laid claim to them.  From your comments, I see that it\u2019s normal for you to eat that evening\u2019s leftovers when you get home from work, so NTA.  You can\u2019t mind read, so you had no way to know that she wanted something different from the norm to happen", "NTA. Unlabelled leftovers are a free for all at our place. When I keep leftover for lunch I label. Simple trick that has avoided unnecessary stress over the years.", "NTA. How would you know what not to eat if it wasn't labeled? Although I currently live alone, I still pack my lunch the night before. I have a collection of bento boxes and containers I use so there is no confusion. Maybe suggest to your mom a set of containers specifically for her lunches; there are tons of attractive and inexpensive options. Or, sticky notes, painter's tape, dry erase markers, etc. Not your fault you ate because you were hungry, but if other members of your family don't want this to happen again, there are ways they can use to ensure that.", "NTA - if mom wanted the leftovers, she should have left a note or packed it in a way you knew it wasn't fair game for eating. And it's disturbing that she called you an AH over something this minor.", "NTA, unless there was a reason to suspect that was mom's lunch, like she regularly does that and you knew about that in advance.", "NTA\n\nThat was last night's dinner leftovers, and you were hungry. How were you to know she wanted it for herself if she didn't leave a note on it?\n\nSuggest to her that to avoid future insanely crazy outbursts, she should leave a note on the container that it's her lunch. \n\n(Don't use my words)", "NTA her calling you an asshole was uncalled for.", "NTA. As someone who has a mother and is a mother myself, I can not fathom a mother speaking to their child that way in any situation, let alone over some leftover food.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You didn\u2019t know who the leftovers belonged to but you knew they weren\u2019t yours.", "YTA - why does it need to be labelled that it belonged to someone else?

Do you pay for your part of the groceries? \nHow are left overs normally handled? \n\nThere really is not much to go on, and frankly the missing info makes it sound like you left it out for a reason\n\nHere, no one just grabs any leftovers unless you're the one who made the food and put it in the fridge, or it was said after dinner that it was free to take for whoever wants it. Else, we check to see if there were plans for it.", "NTA. However, I suggest that you apologize to your mother by buying her a unique lunch bag that she can put her container in. Then everyone will know that this food is hers.", "My sister and I (sepretly) used to make a lot of food, and we always ended leaving some leftovers in the fridge. I didn't care who ate my food, but she sometimes wanted to have a something just for her. But people always ate whatever was in the fridge, and she got really upset we touched her food.

It took some time, but eventually she had a note that said \"poisonous, do not eat\".", "I\u2019m pretty used to being called an AH over minor things. I\u2019ve been dealing with it constantly since like middle school so it doesn\u2019t really faze me anymore, but I felt really guilty about eating what I had no clue was going to be her lunch today, hence why I made the post.", "I called my kid a butt all the time. But in a joking he knows I love him way. And it's usually in the process of playing a game.\n\nI have gotten upset at him, but usually walk away and wouldn't call him an asshole to his face. Also, I wouldn't wake him up just to ask of he ate something after he worked until 1:30am.
