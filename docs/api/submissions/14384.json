She left behind a 4 months old daughter (now 17) and a 5 year old son (now 22). My sister was diagnosed with cancer 8 months into her pregnancy and she was aware it was terminal right away. After my niece was born she asked me if I would keep her dresses (she had a collection of very nice dresses she had accumulated because she worked for a fashion magazine and got discounts and freebies sometimes) and her favorite jewelry for her kids. She said maybe her daughter wouldn't want the clothes but if she did, they would be with me. She told me she knew her husband loved her. But she knew he would remarry and that lines can be blurred and she really didn't want any of his future children or his future wife laying claim to her possessions. She wanted them for her children. She had a necklace that she knew her son would like one day (and he asked for it when he was 15 and still wears it today). I said of course.\n\nHer husband did remarry. About a year after my sister died he told our family he had gotten another woman pregnant and then a couple of months later announced they were to marry. Things were awkward for a few years. He was still part of our lives but we had not been close when my sister was alive and his wife was holding some hard feelings toward him and us. Their older daughter is 14 and they have a 9 year old daughter together as well.\n\nThe 14 year old has a school dance coming up and wanted to wear one of my sister's dresses because she saw a photo of my sister wearing one and heard from her dad that I had them. He told me she wanted a dress and wanted me to send it over with my niece for his daughter. I refused to send it and he responded by asking my nephew. Nephew said his half sister had no business having anything to do with one of his mom's dresses. My niece wasn't angry like my nephew was but she found the idea weird.\n\nMy sister's husband told me it wasn't fair to deny the girl the dress because she's not my sister's daughter and that she is part of the family and it shouldn't be a big deal. I told him I didn't feel comfortable giving it and was going to do what my sister wanted. He suggested she could choose another dress from the collection and I said she was not getting ANY of the dresses. He said I should not be depriving his daughter and she's being treated unfairly. I told him those dresses were nothing to do with her. They are for my sister's children.

Considering the wife died ***after*** her daughter was born, more time can even be added to that range between daughters and not impact the time after death.  \n\n[Edit to add, the daughter was 4 months old when the wife passed,  so we are looking at 24-30 months here which lines up perfectly]\n\nSo yeah, if the older daughter just had a birthday and the younger one is about to then everything checks out.", "It is if the eldest just turned 17 and/or the youngest is about to turn 15.", "She could have had a miscarriage with the first baby.", "Ah missed that bit. Though if the 14 is closer to 15 and 17 is closer to 17 then age difference of roughly 2 cud be possible so cud still be closer to a year after death then 2. Any case it all is jst conjecture", "you know there are sons and daughters, right?", "Third paragraph from the last one to the first:\n\n\u201cHer husband did remarry. About a year after my sister died he told our family he had gotten another woman pregnant and then a couple of months later announced they were to marry.\u201d\n\nThose are OP\u2019s words. It might have taken them a while to organize the wedding, but he was already set on marrying the woman he impregnated a year after OP\u2019s sister died.\n\nI\u2019m not saying this means he was cheating on her, but that the marriage was considerably fast.", "I feel bad for op's niece and nephew. Not only did they lost their mother, their dad clearly didn't give a flying fuck for her since he remarried right away. Now he disrespects her again. His daughter is just being told she can't have a dress that belonged to someone with whom she had no relationship with. Hardly something to be traumatized about. \n\n>still a different thing from just wearing the thing one time\n\nNo, it's not", "He waited only a year. Ofc op's family wasn't happy. And op's sister, the owner of the dresses clearly told op she didn't want her husband's future kids to have her things, so the point is moot.", "Maybe not get someone knocked up less than a year after his wife's death.", "Oh please just give it a rest and stop acting like you know more than OP in this situation.", "Or that baby was a son not interested in dresses.", "It's also possible that the 14yo is the second child and the first child is irrelevant to the story and left out. The new wife could have easily gotten pregnant again and had another child shortly after her first, which would line up with the age of the daughter in question.", "Man, Reddit really just loves to assume the worst \ud83d\ude02", "Okay Reddit \ud83d\ude44 I feel like OP would have mentioned that in this info dump.", "It\u2019s still wild conjecture to assume that because he got someone else pregnant a year or two later, that he must have been cheating. 3 months? Maybe. It is well known that many men do move on quickly after their wives pass, partly because they don\u2019t know how to be alone in their grief. But to escalate that to assume he must have been cheating on his dying wife is just gross. I\u2019m not saying that doesn\u2019t happen, I am saying that we have literally no reasonable implication of this here. He announced her pregnancy but didn\u2019t say he was marrying her until a few months after that. So, it doesn\u2019t seem to me at all that she was someone he\u2019d been with for a long time before.", "From OP:\n\u201cIt's not always just men. My sister's friend lost her dad at age 6 and her mom was remarried less than a year later. Some people do not like being single, some marry for help (financial, parenting help) and some people just seem to find it easier than others. I don't judge him for how fast he moved. Though I have always suspected he was just hooking up and the baby complicated things. But it's none of my business.\u201d", "Is there a rule that governs widowers from finding love?\n\nAlso, I didn't suggest giving things away. I suggested lending the dress.", "Of course. Wouldn't be Reddit without it. Lol.", "We're all just speculating here, I was just coming up with a possibility that would make the time line work.", "Saying he must have is indeed gross. Saying its a possibility as to why the sister took the actions she did not so much. All in all can't say any absolutes on that subject. But whether he did or not doesn't change that he's in the wrong for current actions.", "Sorry I don\u2019t understand how this proves I\u2019m wrong about the dates?\n\nI never said only dudes do this or that OP is judging the guy, just that they were married in a year and a couple months and some people might consider that fast (including the person whose comment you answered and me).", "No, but there is a moral rule of waiting a little more before you remarry. \n\n>I suggested lending the dress.\n\nIt's the same. She, the owner, didn't want her husband's kids with his next wife, to have her things. There are many other dresses, the kid can find another dress. And by how entitled she and her dad act, it wasn't gonna be just a lending, they would've kept the dress."]}
