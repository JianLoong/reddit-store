She left behind a 4 months old daughter (now 17) and a 5 year old son (now 22). My sister was diagnosed with cancer 8 months into her pregnancy and she was aware it was terminal right away. After my niece was born she asked me if I would keep her dresses (she had a collection of very nice dresses she had accumulated because she worked for a fashion magazine and got discounts and freebies sometimes) and her favorite jewelry for her kids. She said maybe her daughter wouldn't want the clothes but if she did, they would be with me. She told me she knew her husband loved her. But she knew he would remarry and that lines can be blurred and she really didn't want any of his future children or his future wife laying claim to her possessions. She wanted them for her children. She had a necklace that she knew her son would like one day (and he asked for it when he was 15 and still wears it today). I said of course.\n\nHer husband did remarry. About a year after my sister died he told our family he had gotten another woman pregnant and then a couple of months later announced they were to marry. Things were awkward for a few years. He was still part of our lives but we had not been close when my sister was alive and his wife was holding some hard feelings toward him and us. Their older daughter is 14 and they have a 9 year old daughter together as well.\n\nThe 14 year old has a school dance coming up and wanted to wear one of my sister's dresses because she saw a photo of my sister wearing one and heard from her dad that I had them. He told me she wanted a dress and wanted me to send it over with my niece for his daughter. I refused to send it and he responded by asking my nephew. Nephew said his half sister had no business having anything to do with one of his mom's dresses. My niece wasn't angry like my nephew was but she found the idea weird.\n\nMy sister's husband told me it wasn't fair to deny the girl the dress because she's not my sister's daughter and that she is part of the family and it shouldn't be a big deal. I told him I didn't feel comfortable giving it and was going to do what my sister wanted. He suggested she could choose another dress from the collection and I said she was not getting ANY of the dresses. He said I should not be depriving his daughter and she's being treated unfairly. I told him those dresses were nothing to do with her. They are for my sister's children.

She wanted her kids to have her stuff but not until they would be the only ones with access.", "Yes. Safeguarding them until the daughter is no longer living under the father and stepmother\u2019s roof is a sensible thing to do.", "The niece is still a minor and lives in her father's home. OP  is right to keep them until the niece is out of the house. \n\nEspecially since OP says the stepmother tries to pretend that the sister never existed.", "I call BS. she never had that conversation with you.", "Yes, she did. She did not want the second wife or any additional children getting their hands on her stuff. She wanted them to be for her children and her children only. That is the reason she asked me to take care of them. She saw her own friend's fathers stuff be given to a half sibling who was not his kid and did not want the same thing to happen."]}
