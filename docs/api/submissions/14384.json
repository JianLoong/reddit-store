She left behind a 4 months old daughter (now 17) and a 5 year old son (now 22). My sister was diagnosed with cancer 8 months into her pregnancy and she was aware it was terminal right away. After my niece was born she asked me if I would keep her dresses (she had a collection of very nice dresses she had accumulated because she worked for a fashion magazine and got discounts and freebies sometimes) and her favorite jewelry for her kids. She said maybe her daughter wouldn't want the clothes but if she did, they would be with me. She told me she knew her husband loved her. But she knew he would remarry and that lines can be blurred and she really didn't want any of his future children or his future wife laying claim to her possessions. She wanted them for her children. She had a necklace that she knew her son would like one day (and he asked for it when he was 15 and still wears it today). I said of course.\n\nHer husband did remarry. About a year after my sister died he told our family he had gotten another woman pregnant and then a couple of months later announced they were to marry. Things were awkward for a few years. He was still part of our lives but we had not been close when my sister was alive and his wife was holding some hard feelings toward him and us. Their older daughter is 14 and they have a 9 year old daughter together as well.\n\nThe 14 year old has a school dance coming up and wanted to wear one of my sister's dresses because she saw a photo of my sister wearing one and heard from her dad that I had them. He told me she wanted a dress and wanted me to send it over with my niece for his daughter. I refused to send it and he responded by asking my nephew. Nephew said his half sister had no business having anything to do with one of his mom's dresses. My niece wasn't angry like my nephew was but she found the idea weird.\n\nMy sister's husband told me it wasn't fair to deny the girl the dress because she's not my sister's daughter and that she is part of the family and it shouldn't be a big deal. I told him I didn't feel comfortable giving it and was going to do what my sister wanted. He suggested she could choose another dress from the collection and I said she was not getting ANY of the dresses. He said I should not be depriving his daughter and she's being treated unfairly. I told him those dresses were nothing to do with her. They are for my sister's children. He called me pathetic.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: Just a quick edit to say I have likely gotten his other kids ages wrong. The older one is more likely 15 now and I think I might have aged up the younger one. I'm not close to these kids, don't spend time with them or anything really.\n\nBut the timeline was about a year after my sister died he told us he had gotten another woman pregnant. The older of his two girls with wife #2 is that child. Second one was born a few years after. They were married a few months into her first pregnancy. Sorry for that confusion. My niece only recently turned 17 so doing actual math in my head 15 is more likely for the first child with his second wife.

That's roughly 7.5 months of pregnancy after knowledge.  4+(12 to 18)+7.5= 23.5 to 29.5 months.  \n - That's a completely reasonable range for this story to take place in \n\nSo are you telling us you just like making troll posts, or do you not know how calendars work?", "I don't think he has helped at all.

I have several chronic illnesses and my family and I are fully aware that my life will be much shorter than expected. My parents are in their 70's and my mother has her will in order but she planned for my passing years ago. I had my first surgery when I was 23, my brother was 20. My parents are divorced but they set aside their differences to be there with me during the surgery. Which is significant because although they had been divorced for over a decade at that time they were not on good terms. One of their biggest arguments had been my health and how I was receiving medical care since before their divorce. After the surgery the doctor told them all to prepare for my death because she found \"cancer\" throughout my abdomen. She took biopsies but she believed that I was going to die very soon. Thankfully, she was incorrect, it was endometriosis. However, I had already had two different cancers at that time and my father lost his sister to one of the same cancers when I was 4 years old. It was all very traumatic for them. My brother and my father have never again been with me for a surgery or a hospital stay, even in times that we were not sure I would live. They always call me, but they will not see me. It works for us because I really prefer not to have visitors. I'd be lying if i said it doesn't hurt sometimes.

Most of this is true for my lesbian friends (obviously there's over lap in interests like gaming). \n\nI think the main difference is the lack of heteronormative expectations and power differences when you're both the same sex. The rest of the annoying stuff like compatibility, the potential of cheating, chemistry or lack thereof, is still going to be there if it's going to be a romantic/sexual relationship. You're going to fall for people you with whom you have incompatible lifestyles and interests. You're going to get jealous because you covet your partner. You're going to have to balance both of your wants and needs. \n\nYou're straight so your description of \"dating\" a woman is understandably lacking in the sexual and romantic aspects. Basically, you're thinking of friendships, which is not how (sexual) relationships between women work. Not all women are as you described, but you would never end up \"dating\" a socially incompatible woman, because you're not going off sexual attraction, you're looking for a friend."]}
