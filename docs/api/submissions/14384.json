She said maybe her daughter wouldn't want the clothes but if she did, they would be with me. She told me she knew her husband loved her.

Nephew said his half sister had no business having anything to do with one of his mom's dresses.

I told him I didn't feel comfortable giving it and was going to do what my sister wanted.
