I don't see him anymore. I moved away to another town across the state. His sister is graduating from a college nearby, and he texted me asking if he could crash on my couch and stay with me when he comes out to see her graduation in a couple of weeks. I told my boyfriend, because there's a bit more to the situation (R's dad is friends with my bio mom, and she's abusive and I don't want her finding out where I live). So I brought the scenario up to A. He immediately got weird and said he'd be incredibly uncomfortable, and immediately assumed he would be sleeping in the same bed as me. I told him absolutely not, he can either crash on the couch or I'd get a blow up mattress. He said he doesn't even want to be around me with him around. I'm appalled. I got annoyed with him and then he said do whatever you want, I don't care.

Also, did he give you a specific reason that it made him uncomfortable for your friend spending the night with you? \n\nI would ask these questions and try to learn more before I would consider this a red flag or to automatic think your BF is evil or controlling.

Not because I'm enlightened, but because we've only been dating three months and I really wouldn't be that emotionally invested in you. You would have earned respect from me if you offered a solution like \"hey come over and spend the night when he's here because I'd love for you to meet him.\" \n\nThen it's on him to come up with another solution.
