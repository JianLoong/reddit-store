I love my sister but her fianc\u00e9 really likes bossing me around so I always go to her before doing anything. Even then he still punished me.\n\nA week or so  back, I asked my sister for these shoes I really wanted. She originally said no, but eventually caved. A few days later I can\u2019t find the shoes anywhere and I ask her fianc\u00e9 where they are and he says he took them back. I ask my sister and she said it was because I didn\u2019t do the dishes as she had asked and that I had pressured her into it in the first place and she\u2019s tired of me not doing chores. Her fianc\u00e9 comes into my room later and says that my sister is having a hard time right now and I need to stop pressuring her into getting me things and that I need to pull my weight or I\u2019ll stop getting allowances too.\n\nA few days later my sister and I were arguing while I was driving us home from my parents house and she kept on asking me to pull over which was only stressing me out more and I was trying to pull over and I ended up totaling her car. When her fianc\u00e9 found out he was only concerned about her and whether or not she was ok. She wasn\u2019t hurt that badly just a mild concussion, a dislocated shoulder, and some stitches. I broke my wrist and got a total of 16 stitches. He took a week off to take care of her while he made me go back to school the next day. Got her a bunch of get well soon gifts new pajamas, a nice blanket, stuffed animal. All the while \n\nWell fast forward another day and her boyfriend asks me to help with dishes since the dishwasher was broken and I hadn\u2019t made any dirty dishes that day and I told him that and he looked kinda baffled but then asked me to scoop the cat litter. I said that it was my cat and he said I needed to help out still so I went up yo the bedroom to tell my sister what was going on and he\u2019s telling me to leave her alone, but he\u2019s bossing me around and so I wake my sister up and tell her what\u2019s going on and she starts like sobbing. I was happy at first because I thought she was mad at her fianc\u00e9 too but then she was all like \u201cJack, I can\u2019t do this anymore. I tried so hard to be there for her.\u201d She was talking about me and not being able to handle me anymore. And her boyfriend is comforting her and telling me that I need to leave her be for a while.\n\nI didn\u2019t see her for a few days since she had locked herself away in her room and then saw her in the kitchen yesterday after school. I told her that her boyfriend hates me and is trying to taint her opinion against me to get rid of me and she said that she loves me and her fianc\u00e9 loves me and that I need to grow up because she can\u2019t take this attitude anymore.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m being reasonable here and her fianc\u00e9 is being a douche.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696376058, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16z7b92/aita_for_going_to_my_sister_when_her_fianc\u00e9_tries/", "score": 208, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You sound like an entitled kid (you are a kid) who doesn't want to help out around the house when asked. \n\nThey took you in, are taking care of you, and when asked to do things around the house you complain that it's not fair and you're being bossed around. I don't doubt you did keep begging for shoes until she caved, and I also don't doubt that you didn't do the chores you were asked to do, which led to Fianc\u00e9e taking the shoes back. \n\nAnd you totaled her car after being asked repeatedly to pull over. I bet that what really happened is you were arguing and driving recklessly, hence the repeated asking you to pull over.\n\nShe seems to now be about fed up with you too. And from the way you describe everything, I don't blame her.", "YTA.  This is slanted so sharply to make her fiancee the asshole that I know there's a lot missing.  Why are you blowing off totaling a car?  That's a big deal.  If you can't drive when stressed you can't drive because driving itself is often stressful.  You're really lucky you weren't hurt.  I also disagree with your characterization of her injuries.  Concussion, dislocated shoulder, and stitches is pretty serious.\n\nYou're 16.  Why the hell do you have to be told to do your chores? Why are you bullying her until she buys what you want?  Get a part time job and pay for your wants yourself.  I'm betting she's very close to kicking you out.  You need to change your behavior quickly if you don't want that to happen.

Your sister, who has no obligation to take you in mind you, took you into her home to care and love you while you're dealing with your parents rocky relationship. When she took you in that added to all of her expenses; food, electric, water, spending money. It also added to her emotional load. Its drain caring for another human being, especially one that you didnt plan on having/taking care of. Your sister seems to have done quite a bit for you, and in return you ask for more? In return you leave messes around the house? In return you total her car and downplay her injuries? It doesn't even sound like you've taken your sister's feelings into the matter at all. She's human too, and she's not a parent so this is probably even more stressful than in normal circumstances. \n\nIt sounds like her Fianc\u00e9 is just sticking up for his partner. It doesn't even sound like he hates you, it sounds like he just wants some help around the house that you're also living in. Has he even been mean or rude to you? Or has he just asked you to do chores? \n\nIf you want to repair the relationship between you and your sister try sitting down and talking to her about what she's expecting from you while living there and what you are expecting from her.

You just want things given to you. Life doesn't work that way. Families don't work that way either. \n\nLegally, they have to house, clothe, feed, and make sure you get to school.

I also could see op switching from fiance to boyfriend as the story progressed was her minimalizing his significance. Like \"I'm your sister, he's just a boyfriend.\" Sometimes inconsistencies do tell a lot about the writer. If she was really pissed off, typos make sense bc she's too angry to focus on writing.

Now I'm thinking that again because it used to be that if a post ended up on my fyp it was already  a popular reddit post, but now new posts that have very low engagement are being pushed out right after they were posted here. So, my conspiracy theory is that Tik-tok content mills are cutting out the middle man and creating posts themselves using AI.

Feels like an actual person would have said Jack throughout - why bother coming up with a fake name at all, and if you\u2019re using a real name then why say \u201cher fiance\u201d all but once?\n\nAnyhow, I am with you - the authorship history is the most interesting part here.

Like bruising, whiplash symptoms, and even sometimes concussions. I phrased it wrong so that's my bad, but really my issue is that it's right after a traumatic event. Physically and mentally traumatic. Op said she was sent the next day so she had little recovery time. Also the time that the crash happened affects this a lot. They would have had to be taken to the hospital, been treated, and probably have to of had to give police statements. I know police aren't always involved but the car was totaled and there were serious injuries(even if op disagrees.) And it was a minor driving so that's a factor. This would have taken a good few hours to straighten this all out so it's unclear when they would have gotten home and been able to sleep/do other things. It's very odd to go from totaling a car to intro to algebra in 24 hours. \n\nLike I know op's got an attitude issue but it's very mean to force her to go to school after that, even if it is her fault. Going by how often the sister coddles her it's hard for me to see her being the one to make that call so it's probably the fiance's decision. He's within his rights to  tell her to do chores in his home but I'm confused as to why it's his call if she can stay home after the crash. Is he her legal guardian? Is the sister even legally her guardian? If they are legally responsible then if she misses too much school they'd be in trouble so I do see why he might've had her go. It would be an excused absence though.\n\nOp has parents but chooses not to live with them so I think they'd probably pay for her medical bills at the very least.

Do the parents send child support? \n\nThings about this story really don't add up and I'm starting to really believe that it's AI generated. Like real humans don't behave like this.
