I love my sister but her fianc\u00e9 really likes bossing me around so I always go to her before doing anything.

A few days later I can\u2019t find the shoes anywhere and I ask her fianc\u00e9 where they are and he says he took them back. I ask my sister and she said it was because I didn\u2019t do the dishes as she had asked and that I had pressured her into it in the first place and she\u2019s tired of me not doing chores. Her fianc\u00e9 comes into my room later and says that my sister is having a hard time right now and I need to stop pressuring her into getting me things and that I need to pull my weight or I\u2019ll stop getting allowances too.\n\nA few days later my sister and I were arguing while I was driving us home from my parents house and she kept on asking me to pull over which was only stressing me out more and I was trying to pull over and I ended up totaling her car. When her fianc\u00e9 found out he was only concerned about her and whether or not she was ok. She wasn\u2019t hurt that badly just a mild concussion, a dislocated shoulder, and some stitches. I broke my wrist and got a total of 16 stitches. He took a week off to take care of her while he made me go back to school the next day.

All the while \n\nWell fast forward another day and her boyfriend asks me to help with dishes since the dishwasher was broken and I hadn\u2019t made any dirty dishes that day and I told him that and he looked kinda baffled but then asked me to scoop the cat litter. I said that it was my cat and he said I needed to help out still so I went up yo the bedroom to tell my sister what was going on and he\u2019s telling me to leave her alone, but he\u2019s bossing me around and so I wake my sister up and tell her what\u2019s going on and she starts like sobbing. I was happy at first because I thought she was mad at her fianc\u00e9 too but then she was all like \u201cJack, I can\u2019t do this anymore. I tried so hard to be there for her.\u201d She was talking about me and not being able to handle me anymore.

I told her that her boyfriend hates me and is trying to taint her opinion against me to get rid of me and she said that she loves me and her fianc\u00e9 loves me and that I need to grow up because she can\u2019t take this attitude anymore.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m being reasonable here and her fianc\u00e9 is being a douche.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696376058, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16z7b92/aita_for_going_to_my_sister_when_her_fianc\u00e9_tries/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You sound like an entitled kid (you are a kid) who doesn't want to help out around the house when asked. \n\nThey took you in, are taking care of you, and when asked to do things around the house you complain that it's not fair and you're being bossed around. I don't doubt you did keep begging for shoes until she caved, and I also don't doubt that you didn't do the chores you were asked to do, which led to Fianc\u00e9e taking the shoes back. \n\nAnd you totaled her car after being asked repeatedly to pull over. I bet that what really happened is you were arguing and driving recklessly, hence the repeated asking you to pull over.\n\nShe seems to now be about fed up with you too. And from the way you describe everything, I don't blame her.", "YTA.  This is slanted so sharply to make her fiancee the asshole that I know there's a lot missing.  Why are you blowing off totaling a car?  That's a big deal.  If you can't drive when stressed you can't drive because driving itself is often stressful.  You're really lucky you weren't hurt.  I also disagree with your characterization of her injuries.  Concussion, dislocated shoulder, and stitches is pretty serious.\n\nYou're 16.  Why the hell do you have to be told to do your chores? Why are you bullying her until she buys what you want?  Get a part time job and pay for your wants yourself.  I'm betting she's very close to kicking you out.  You need to change your behavior quickly if you don't want that to happen.  Expect her to go low contact once you're gone until you've proven you've changed.", "You have to realize that your sister and her fiance are not your parents and they are doing you a favor.  Do your chores!  When you're asked the first time, not hours later.  Don't pressure her to buy you things, she doesn't have a lot of money at this stage in her career.\n\nYou said it wasn't a big deal that she got hurt in a car accident, but if she was sleeping then she was tired, why would you ever wake her up?  That's very selfish of you.  Start thinking of what you can do to help more around the house.", "YTA\n\nA concussion is a brain injury. She needs rest and quiet, not to act as an intermediary because you don\u2019t want to do chores. \n\nYou sound awful. Truly awful.\n\n1. You totaled her car\n2.

Doing household chores even if you didn't make the mess is a trade off in having to pay rent, pay bills, and buy food. \n\nYour sister and fiance are not your parents and they are being generous by letting you live with them instead of having to stay with your parents.", "YTA I feel bad for your sister and fiance for having to deal with the nightmare that is you", "YTA.

Get off your high horse, stop taking advantage of your sister and acting like a princess, and start looking for stuff you can do to make you living there as easy on them as possible. Because let me tell you; they don\u2019t owe you anything.

Your sister, who has no obligation to take you in mind you, took you into her home to care and love you while you're dealing with your parents rocky relationship. When she took you in that added to all of her expenses; food, electric, water, spending money. It also added to her emotional load. Its drain caring for another human being, especially one that you didnt plan on having/taking care of. Your sister seems to have done quite a bit for you, and in return you ask for more? In return you leave messes around the house? In return you total her car and downplay her injuries? It doesn't even sound like you've taken your sister's feelings into the matter at all. She's human too, and she's not a parent so this is probably even more stressful than in normal circumstances. \n\nIt sounds like her Fianc\u00e9 is just sticking up for his partner. It doesn't even sound like he hates you, it sounds like he just wants some help around the house that you're also living in. Has he even been mean or rude to you? Or has he just asked you to do chores? \n\nIf you want to repair the relationship between you and your sister try sitting down and talking to her about what she's expecting from you while living there and what you are expecting from her. Discuss both of your feelings, hear her out and hopefully she will listen to you also. Try to find a good compromise for a good living situation.", "YTA and biting the hand that feeds.

But not in a restaurant because you don't do dishes, have issues with authority and can't drive well enough to do deliveries. \n\nYou won't last long because you don't want to work. You just want things given to you. Life doesn't work that way. Families don't work that way either. \n\nLegally, they have to house, clothe, feed, and make sure you get to school. You don't need anything fancy. \n\nYour sister is hanging on by a hair and is taking solace in her fiance. She is about to kick you out and you can't see it.

You *do* need to be careful with their belongings, and you *do* need to be careful to only ask for what you need, and refrain from *demanding* luxuries that aren\u2019t truly necessary.
