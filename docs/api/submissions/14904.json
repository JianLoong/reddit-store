Sorted", "NTA. Sounds like she has some other hang up", "NTA - Can't.. stop... laughing....", "NTA. My biggest question is, why is she still stalking your IG to even know you've got that picture up?", "NTA thats so random. block her", "I'm saying NTA, it is a dog not the person or their child.  While all dogs are unique as long as you didn't tag them in the pic or anything no one will ever know that doesn't already.  Plus, as someone who never takes good pictures, it is a really good pic.", "NTA. That is some off the charts insecurity.", "NTA. Who fucking cares", "NTA. Why is she going back through your photos so often\u2026", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having a sentimental photo in your social media, phone, or elsewhere. Block her so she can\u2019t be bothered by seeing it anymore.", "NTA you wouldn't be an asshole to block her either", "NTA, but is this really about the dog, or is it just an excuse to talk to you?", "NTA. It' s your social media, and you can post whatever you like on it. If she doesn't like it, she doesn't have to look - and why is she looking, anyway?", "NTA. It's not a picture of her. She should just stop looking at your Instagram. You shouldn't be asked to erase memories of your own life.", "Well, my ex literally used a picture of him hugging my (admittedly beautiful) dog as his online dating profile picture on tinder for several months after we broke up. That was more than a little awkward to discover firsthand..... especially considering I was the one who had taken that picture. \ud83d\ude06 NTA as long as you're not claiming ownership of the dog.", "NTA. It's a good pic with a good boy (or girl), and not everybody feels the need to remove all traces of an ex, however minor, after a break-up. However, depending on how you parted, I can see how an ex could take it as a spiteful FU move, because there are people who would keep it up that way.\n\nThe obvious solution: MORE pictures with MORE dogs. Flood your account with dog selfies. It's now a you <3 dogs account. She will definitely take it as a spiteful move, but who cares? Imagine all the dogs.", "i kind of get it because as a person who has had a couple of ex\u2019s\u2026 you get this uncontrollable \u201citch\u201d to wipe out everything that correlates you two together and this photo is prob bothering her because she can\u2019t do anything about it.\nHOWEVER  it\u2019s not a big deal so NTA (it\u2019s not like it\u2019s her, it\u2019s her dog, and she\u2019s not tagged so very few people who know the girl\u2019s dog will correlate that the dog is hers in an ex\u2019s photo) , and besides it won\u2019t bother her as she matures from the relationship ending and will eventually not give a shit\n*edited for grammar", "NTA block them. Simple as that. Don't let them weasel their way into your head space 2 years later.", "You don't understand how quickly I'd point out that by her logic it was actually my dog when the picture was taken. My fingers would get whiplash. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

It's so easy to delete one photo.  Have more photos of yourself taken, do a photoshoot with a professional photographer if you don't have enough pics of yourself.\n\nSure, it seems like a silly request, but refusing to do it make you seem like you enjoy upsetting your ex.  Just delete the photo, block your ex, and move on with your life.  \n\nYTA for thinking that one good photo of yourself is worth this drama.", "So ... lemme get this straight ... there's a post of you on Instagram that your current girlfriend doesn't like, for whatever reason. \n\nAnd your *actual,* flesh and blood girlfriend, wants you to delete that picture. Because she doesn't like it. For whatever reason. \n\nAnd you don't want to. Because you look good in that picture. On Instagram, where nothing matters. On Instagram, where anonymous strangers might click 'Like' because you look good in a picture with a dog. On Instagram. \n\nOn Instagram. \n\nHey ... if Instagram could give you a hand-job while you're stuck in traffic, I'd be all for it. Take a stand! Tell her what's what! Does she really think she's more important than Instagram Likes? That's insane!\n\nOr ... OR ... you could join us in magical land we like to call Reality. \n\nSome dumb picture on Instagram ultimately has no importance. \n\nMan-up.
