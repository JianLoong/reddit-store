Since he\u2019s been unemployed I\u2019ve been carrying him financially. I\u2019m getting ready to move in with my boyfriend. My ex has been \u201ctrying to get a job & move out\u201d for a while, but I haven\u2019t seen ANY work on this. All I see him doing is playing video games, watching movies, or working on projects that don\u2019t make him any money. The initial plan for the move was that if my ex couldn\u2019t find a place separate from me before I got a place with my boyfriend that he could come & stay in what will be my craft room for a few weeks so he could figure something else out. All of my friends say it\u2019s not my responsibility to take care of my ex. He uses my car (that I got months after we split) & doesn\u2019t respect even the most basic requests that I have in regards to maintaining my car. If something breaks (even if he\u2019s the one that breaks it) he expects me to fix it.\n\nThings hit a breaking point a few days ago. Someone broke into my car & tried to steal it. They weren\u2019t able to steal it, but they did a lot of damage & will cost hundreds of dollars to fix, which at this point is practically the total worth of the car. My ex was the last person to use the car. I have repeatedly told him that he NEEDS to put the Club that I have on the steering wheel whenever he uses it. When I asked him if he put the club on he said \u201cyou didn\u2019t put it on when you got home from work so I didn\u2019t think I needed to.\u201d I\u2019ve also told him that he HAS to close the doors in a certain way, because the car is so old that if you don\u2019t close the doors a certain way they don\u2019t seal properly & it makes it easy to break into the car. He closes the doors wrong, & acts like I\u2019m being ridiculous despite the fact that I\u2019ve shown him that it\u2019s such an issue that the cab of the car will flood in the rain if you don\u2019t close the door properly. When I told him that the car was broken into & destroyed he immediately told me it wasn\u2019t his fault & that completely ignoring my requests didn\u2019t mean anything. He won\u2019t even apologize to me about the fact that he never does any of the things I ask him to do, let alone offer to help me replace any of the parts.\n\nMy boyfriend thinks this is the final straw & has decided that he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with someone that acts that way moving in with us. Also, my boyfriend is encouraging me to use the money I\u2019ve saved to buy a newer car, because the broken car is already a ticking time bomb, & it\u2019s not worth spending the time & money to try & fix it. And my boyfriend is pushing me to tell me ex that he\u2019s not allowed to use my car & can\u2019t have a key. \n\nIf I tell him he\u2019s not moving with us, & that he can\u2019t use my car, he doesn\u2019t really have any other options & it will make him homeless.

He has had time enough to get his ducks in a row and since he's used to the fact that you take care of all his needs he had never had the necessity to do anything. You are enabling his behaviour and actions. Stop doing that. He is an adult for fluffing sake.  \n\n\nAgain, he is not your responsibility.

How would you feel if he had his ex gf still in his life like this? It almost feels like you've continued to be in a relationship with your ex, without calling it a relationship. \n\nWhat does he even bring to the table? Seems like only problems to me. He doesn't work. He doesn't contribute. He doesn't make any one aspect of your life better (from the sounds of it). Think of it this way--he's worked you over this long in order to provide a roof over his head, food in his belly, a place to plug the gaming console in and a car to drive. I can assure you he'll find someone else to work over, because that's what he does. When someone shows you who they are, believe them. He'll live. It's not your problem. This isn't healthy for you or your relationship. And I can't imagine a partner that would put up with this kind of arrangement long term. Your current relationship deserves your focus and energy.

At this point, I see you being single very soon.", "NTA, and he's not your problem.", "NTA but pleeeease, you need to get rid of your ex. I agree with your friends: your ex is an adult and it is absolutely not your responsibility to care for him. He is taking advantage of you and will not stop doing so. Move in with your boyfriend and let your ex figure out his living situation on his own. It's a wake-up call your ex desperately needs.", "NTA for kicking him out but you're the AH for enabling him this long. He's an ex, not your child. You owe him nothing and it's frankly weird that you'd take him with you to the new place. Move on. Your boyfriend deserves better.", "YTA for putting up with this bullshit. I'm surprised your BF hasn't broken up with you long ago for this dead weight you allow to have around. \n\nEdit because I got tot the part where you were going to let him move in with you. Your bf should have broken up with you and blocked you from his life for even thinking it. I would wonder what bonkers life decisions you would make in the future if I was your bf and run away.\n\nHe's an adult. You are not responsible for him.

That mutual friend backstabbed us and tried to ruin both of our lives in what I can only assume was some kind of mental health breakdown. \nAt the same time, I was struggling to find a place for myself because I work in an under paid industry in California and the housing requirements were too high for me to get approved anywhere on my own. At the time I didn\u2019t have anyone to move in with, or that could move in with me, so I was going to just quietly stay in the apartment and try to find a friend to move in with me. Because of the ridiculous rules from our landlord, I can\u2019t take my ex off the lease unless I can prove that I meet the income requirements by myself, which I don\u2019t. So to a certain extent I was stuck. I\u2019ve been pressuring my ex to get a job and help pay bills or get a place of his own, but he hasn\u2019t. One of the reasons I\u2019m moving in with my boyfriend is to get out from under the lease I\u2019m currently stuck in, and get out of a situation where I can\u2019t remove my ex because he won\u2019t be on any lease I sign.", "Girl what the hell?

But as you deal with your sense of responsibility for ex,  remember that by accepting it, you have created the condition in which your ex feels safe to avoid accepting responsibility for his own life and well being. \n\nI wish you and your new person the best and hope he is as good of a person as you see and that it's not just the blinders of years of toxicity.", "her bf and her are working off of one very tired braincell it seems. Ex must feel like he hit the jackpot. Not just one doormat to take advantage of but two! Honestly at this point Ex would be an idiot if he let such a good little atm go, but clearly Ex is the most intelligent of the three (not saying much)", "This is actually kinda pathetic. Someone who burns themselves so much while trying to keep some dude who isn't even trying warm is pretty sad. \n\nYou're not being compassionate, you're enabling this man's foolishness.", "this is so unfair to your second boyfriend", "I do need to get therapy, though for a variety of other reasons. Long story short, adhd and autism and trauma bonding with my ex (our house burned down in front of us many years ago) have made it very difficult to set boundaries, especially with people I care about. I\u2019m really working on it, and I\u2019m definitely doing a lot better, but setting new boundaries with people that were in my life before I made progress on boundary setting is especially difficult for me.", "You should try gay polyamory posts. That's a lot of boyfriends.", "You can care for him without damaging yourself.\n\nIt's not care what you have been doing, it's you enabling him. I know it is hard to decide to do what is best for you, but think of ot as caring for your current boyfriend and future with him more than your ex.\n\nHe has a lot of trauma, but so do you, so has anyone and he could have started getting help long ago, if it was just watching videos on YouTube.\n\nYou need to stop enabling him and traumatizing yourself again and again. Some people are so used to taking advantage of other's goodwill, that when the other party tries to set boundaries they cry abuse or mistreatment or try to gaslight the other party. They love how easy the situation is for them and they don't want their balance disturbed. You may need to cut contact entirely.", "I feel sorry for you, you literally don\u2019t see your worth and  you just keep getting stepped on, wake up and have some self respect, stop being a dummy, and move on. Yta to your bf, he doesn\u2019t deserve so much baggage"]}
