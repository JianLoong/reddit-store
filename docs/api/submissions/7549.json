Since he\u2019s been unemployed I\u2019ve been carrying him financially. I\u2019m getting ready to move in with my boyfriend. My ex has been \u201ctrying to get a job & move out\u201d for a while, but I haven\u2019t seen ANY work on this. All I see him doing is playing video games, watching movies, or working on projects that don\u2019t make him any money. The initial plan for the move was that if my ex couldn\u2019t find a place separate from me before I got a place with my boyfriend that he could come & stay in what will be my craft room for a few weeks so he could figure something else out. All of my friends say it\u2019s not my responsibility to take care of my ex. He uses my car (that I got months after we split) & doesn\u2019t respect even the most basic requests that I have in regards to maintaining my car. If something breaks (even if he\u2019s the one that breaks it) he expects me to fix it.\n\nThings hit a breaking point a few days ago. Someone broke into my car & tried to steal it. They weren\u2019t able to steal it, but they did a lot of damage & will cost hundreds of dollars to fix, which at this point is practically the total worth of the car. My ex was the last person to use the car. I have repeatedly told him that he NEEDS to put the Club that I have on the steering wheel whenever he uses it. When I asked him if he put the club on he said \u201cyou didn\u2019t put it on when you got home from work so I didn\u2019t think I needed to.\u201d I\u2019ve also told him that he HAS to close the doors in a certain way, because the car is so old that if you don\u2019t close the doors a certain way they don\u2019t seal properly & it makes it easy to break into the car. He closes the doors wrong, & acts like I\u2019m being ridiculous despite the fact that I\u2019ve shown him that it\u2019s such an issue that the cab of the car will flood in the rain if you don\u2019t close the door properly. When I told him that the car was broken into & destroyed he immediately told me it wasn\u2019t his fault & that completely ignoring my requests didn\u2019t mean anything. He won\u2019t even apologize to me about the fact that he never does any of the things I ask him to do, let alone offer to help me replace any of the parts.\n\nMy boyfriend thinks this is the final straw & has decided that he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with someone that acts that way moving in with us. Also, my boyfriend is encouraging me to use the money I\u2019ve saved to buy a newer car, because the broken car is already a ticking time bomb, & it\u2019s not worth spending the time & money to try & fix it. And my boyfriend is pushing me to tell me ex that he\u2019s not allowed to use my car & can\u2019t have a key. \n\nIf I tell him he\u2019s not moving with us, & that he can\u2019t use my car, he doesn\u2019t really have any other options & it will make him homeless.

He's taking advantage of you.", "YWNBTA, You guys split up over two years ago and he's financially depending on you. He's taking you for granted, bless you for actually having some mercy on this man. Don't let this man near your property. He isn't even giving his share of ANYTHING, and you shouldn't waste Time or money on that guy. He needs to learn how to stand with his own feet.", "Your ex is a fluffing adult, you are his ex, not his mother. Why do you still take care of this adult child? He is not your responsibility.\n\nNTA. He has had time enough to get his ducks in a row and since he's used to the fact that you take care of all his needs he had never had the necessity to do anything. You are enabling his behaviour and actions. Stop doing that. He is an adult for fluffing sake.  \n\n\nAgain, he is not your responsibility. I understand your boyfriend completely when he says that your EX should not have a key to either your house together and your own car.

That\u2019s codependent and completely dysfunctional \n\nN T A for finally setting boundaries. But it\u2019s just talk so far.\n\nAs an aside, they didn\u2019t steal the car, so the club isn\u2019t an issue.

But from what I heard back in the day, they\u2019re pretty easy to remove.\n\nEdited to switch judgement after reading follow up comments.", "Total NTA, but you\u2019re enabling his behavior. I know you care about him, but give him until you move out of where you are now to find a new place. You can\u2019t support him forever", "NTA. You\u2019ve done too much already by double. Get on with your life.", "NTA.  He's had it relatively easy, knowing that he can depend on you to bail him out of trouble. If anything, you've been enabling his lack of initiative. If you tell him now, that he's going to be on his own, it may be the spark that he needs to start behaving like an adult.", "NTA, but grow a spine may be ?

How would you feel if he had his ex gf still in his life like this? It almost feels like you've continued to be in a relationship with your ex, without calling it a relationship. \n\nWhat does he even bring to the table? Seems like only problems to me. He doesn't work. He doesn't contribute. He doesn't make any one aspect of your life better (from the sounds of it). Think of it this way--he's worked you over this long in order to provide a roof over his head, food in his belly, a place to plug the gaming console in and a car to drive. I can assure you he'll find someone else to work over, because that's what he does. When someone shows you who they are, believe them. He'll live. It's not your problem. This isn't healthy for you or your relationship. And I can't imagine a partner that would put up with this kind of arrangement long term. Your current relationship deserves your focus and energy. Let the ex go, my friend. You'll be so much better off for it.", "YTA. You're about to live with your ex boyfriend because your actual boyfriend is well beyond patience-of-a-saint to deal with this shit. You're TA 100% for putting your boyfriend through this, and TA for enabling the leech this long at the boyfriend's cost. Who is driving you around now? Dealing with the lazy mess? Yeah. At this point, I see you being single very soon.", "NTA, and he's not your problem.", "NTA but pleeeease, you need to get rid of your ex. I agree with your friends: your ex is an adult and it is absolutely not your responsibility to care for him. He is taking advantage of you and will not stop doing so. Move in with your boyfriend and let your ex figure out his living situation on his own. It's a wake-up call your ex desperately needs.", "NTA for kicking him out but you're the AH for enabling him this long. He's an ex, not your child. You owe him nothing and it's frankly weird that you'd take him with you to the new place. Move on. Your boyfriend deserves better.", "YTA for putting up with this bullshit. I'm surprised your BF hasn't broken up with you long ago for this dead weight you allow to have around. \n\nEdit because I got tot the part where you were going to let him move in with you. Your bf should have broken up with you and blocked you from his life for even thinking it. I would wonder what bonkers life decisions you would make in the future if I was your bf and run away.\n\nHe's an adult. You are not responsible for him.

I don't know how old you are, but if in two years he hasn't made an effort, he's not going to suddenly wake up on his own. Your ex lives with you, is financially dependent on you and doesn't seem to mind, uses and damages your belonging and expects you to fix it, and you still feel sorry for him?
