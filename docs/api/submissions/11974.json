{"id": 11974, "submission_id": "11ntzge", "title": "AITA For Telling My Landlord That My Roommate Broke The Lease?", "selftext": "Back in June, I (19F) applied for an apartment at a college student-targeted apartment complex right next to my university. You are matched with roommates based on your answers to a questionnaire and then placed into an apartment unit. There were many pros, but the relevant ones are that the units are NOT co-ed, but they do allow for overnight stay of a tenant\u2019s guest for 1-2 nights (i.e. a weekend visit). I moved in the first week of August, about two weeks after my app was approved, and met my two roommates. I\u2019ll call them Jess (22F) and Tay (20F). They were both very nice and welcoming, and even offered to help me with my move in process. Later that day, I also met Jess\u2019s husband, Dave (23M). I was surprised she was married (they were apparently wed sometime in the year prior) but I didn\u2019t have any issue until I realized that Dave lives with Jess. \n\nI asked Tay and she confirmed it, saying it was like that the previous year when she moved in. I asked her if the apartment office or our landlord knew. Tay said going by the rules in the lease, she\u2019d assume no, and that she hasn\u2019t said anything because she\u2019s afraid of confrontation. I am too, but I am also incredibly uncomfortable living with a male stranger when I signed up for non-coed living. I asked Jess about it to confirm Dave indeed lives with her and that the landlord doesn\u2019t know, and she laughed and said yeah, she didn\u2019t plan on living out until she finished her degree so she just moved her husband in and doesn\u2019t tell the office. I asked her why not get a one or two bedroom that they can share, and she said she\u2019d already renewed her lease, so it would just be cheaper and more convenient to stay.\n\nThe last straw, though, was when I caught Dave looking at my chest and not even trying to hide it. I felt sick and objectified and it practically ruined my Valentine\u2019s Day. I went straight to the office and told them everything. When I got back to my apartment later that evening, Jess was on the couch crying and ranting. She screamed at me when she saw me and said she\u2019s getting evicted and it\u2019s my fault and that I\u2019m \u201ckicking a poor pregnant college student out on the street\u201d. I didn\u2019t even know she was pregnant! She screamed some more and accused me of trying to ruin her life because now she\u2019ll have to withdraw from college since her only place to go now is her parents\u2019 house, and they live in a city three hours away. They were ultimately given 30 days to move out, but I heard from one of the girls in the office that they turned the key in after about two weeks. I haven\u2019t seen or heard from Jess or Dave since.\n\nThis entire thing came up a couple days ago when I was hanging out with some family members who live in my college town and were asking about how I liked my apartment/roommates/etc. They seemed pretty split on the issue, and I\u2019ve not really wondered if I did anything wrong until now. They have me questioning if I was an asshole. Was I?\n\nEdit- something I couldn\u2019t throw in before posting because of the word count limit is that Tay told me she\u2019d caught Dave checking her out multiple times, and it made her more uncomfortable that she already was. I was also told by one of the girls in the office that had Jess not kept this up for almost two years, they would have just given her the option to kick out her husband. She had also apparently been hiding her dog from the landlord too. So she was being evicted for multiple lease agreement violations.", "created_utc": 1678466391, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ntzge/aita_for_telling_my_landlord_that_my_roommate/", "score": 297, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't do anything except bring it to management's attention. Esp. since her husband seemed a bit creepy\n\nIn my complex, two adults only are allowed in one bedrooms. My downstairs neighbors have three; its two women, married, and one of their son's, nephew, not really sure of the relationship.

She actually had to be questioned by our apartment manager as part of the follow-up/eviction process and she told me she let it all out when they got there.", "Well that\u2019s great! I understand wondering if you were the AH after talking to your family (and I\u2019m still confused as to why they were divided on this), but the main thing is that you and your roommate finally feel comfortable in your living space and you no longer have to carry Jess\u2019s pervy husband.

It's called 'setting a precedent' that you have chosen to do\".", "NTA, you have a right to feel safe where you live. Dave didn't make you feel safe and you took steps to address it.", "NTA. Nope. You are not guilt at all. They broke the lease and they did this for years. She broke many rules. They could have a place to live, she chose to drop from everything.", "NTA but I\u2019m wondering what their plan was with the baby? Was she just going to add them into the mix too?", "NTA\n\nJess had the option of renting a 1 bedroom place where her husband could be on the lease and be up front about her dog and she chose to lie.", "So ok. I lived in these style apartments my first few years of grad school. 4 br apartments with each bedroom on its own lease.  And 2 of the 4 years I lived there I had a roommate move their boyfriend in off lease--in one case the girl moved her boyfriend ans a third girl off lease in one bedroom.\n\nSo I get the frustration. It sucks to agree to share an apartment with 3 people, especially like as a woman expecting to only share things like a bathroom with women, and then have someone violate that. Especially when their extended guests are less than considerate of your space or resources.\n\nBut you need to be careful what battles you pick. \n\nEviction, if the apartment even follows through, is a monthslong process and while they may talk to your roommate, proving this guy lives there is a harder task than you'd anticipate. If pressed by the apartment they could say he's just sleeping over. Basically you need something like him getting medical bills mailed to the apartment to show he's a resident but then you get into weird legalities of fucking with mail.\n\nThe only way this was ever resolved for me was one roommate and her boyfriend decided it was too expensive to keep up with and moved out after like 3 months. And the other roommate stabbed her boyfriend in the apartment, was arrested for DV, and it still took 2 months to actually get her stuff out of the apartment (though part of that was her being in jail and not out on bail). \n\nIf they actually evicted her, you don't owe her shit so don't worry about her. But if that was just her raging, you probably did make the rest of your mutual lease term harder. NTA\n\nBut hey, if he's perving on you, he's likely doing it to other women too. Maybe they'll break up.", "Did you not finish reading it? They were given 30 days & were gone in two weeks. It's handled.", "It\u2019s already been taken care of. It was proven that he lived here pretty quickly. My roommate and our neighbors were all asked by separate staff members. They even called up the girl who used to live in my room (or so I\u2019ve heard) and asked her to confirm if Tay was telling the truth about Dave living here the year before.", "Did you have to leave during the 2 weeks it took them to move out? That must have been super uncomfortable if not.", "I'm glad they took care of it. I know my place was pretty unwilling to get involved when it happened so long as the couples were paying on time and not committing violent crime on the premises.", "I tried to make myself scarce and kept my door locked.", "Nah this place is honestly a little bougie and they\u2019re not afraid to kick ppl out it looks like.", "Lol fair. I was in Memphis."]}
