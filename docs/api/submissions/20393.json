She didn't reply, but instead called my mom... So then my mom called me, and basically said she understood my perspective but that it shouldn't \"kill me\" to just \"suck it up and not cause any drama.\" Apparently my aunt argued that it would look weird if one person didn't participate, because her plan is to have a whiteboard set up in the hallway where everyone's weights will be recorded and she doesn't want people to notice that I wouldn't be included. \n\nMy mom also pointed out that it might cause more gossip about my weight (and past hospitalisation) if I came to the party and refused to participate.

You have a legitimate health concern. Such action could have a massive impact on your progress and mental health. \n\n2.

I can't even get into all of the ways it's horrible (I struggle with my own eating disorders). But she should not be doing this. \n\nIf she just CAAAAN'T not do it, it should absolutely be optional. \n\nBTW, please tell your mom from me that yeah, that kind of game actually CAN kill you. In no way should you be expected to \"suck it up\" and risk your health. Again. \n\nIf your mom is on your side, she needs to go to bat for you. Your aunt owes you a big apology (don't hold your breath). Honestly, this is no different than if they were trying to insist that a diabetic can participate in a candy-eating contest. She's willing to risk your health and wellbeing for a game, so that SHE doesn't \"look bad\". WTactualF \n\nPLEASE try to let go of your guilt. You did a brave and difficult thing, standing up for yourself and your health, and that is important. In an ideal world, our loved ones would \"get it\" immediately, but even when they don't, this is your health.

I mean\u2026 seriously what?? This is just weird. Of all the royal traditions she could have picked, she chooses this one? And the prize is a cake! So give more food to the person who already ate the most? Wow.\nHere\u2019s an idea to help you cope through this. Carry heavy items in your pockets when your weighed coming in. Then, at the party, either throw the heavy items away or put them in the car. On the way out, you\u2019ll weigh less than you did on the way in. Have fun watching them all scratch their heads over this one. Lol", "NTA\n\nHave a nice relaxing time at home.", "NTA.

And your mom is not on your side. If she were, she would not be telling you to \"suck it up\" and \"not cause drama.\" Honestly, your aunt sounds awful, and so does your mom.
