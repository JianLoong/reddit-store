If your mother lets her sister bully her own daughter then she\u2019s a poor excuse for a mother. But it\u2019s worth watching the person who ate the most to throw it all up as they get the final weigh in.", "NTA. Your aunt is crazy if she thinks doing this is a \u201cfun\u201d idea. She needs to not force her obsession with the royals on her family.", "This sub makes me so happy that I have a respectful, responsible, reliable, and self-aware family. Good god", "NTA I don't even have an eating disorder and the whole idea of public weighing makes me cringe . There are plenty of other traditions that are a lot more fun", "NTA for not wanting to get weighed, nor would you be if you decided not to attend.\n\nWere I in your shoes, however, I would take great pleasure in some mischief making by hiding 10-20 extra pounds of ankle weights on my person for the weigh-in, and then lose them somewhere before the weigh-out, just to throw things off.", "NTA. You don\u2019t cause drama, your aunt did. Hilariously and abhorrently tactless \u201ctradition\u201d to participate in.", "NTA. This 'game' is stupid.  I would also refuse to participate and would probably skip the gluttony party.  Yeah, I sometimes over eat but not on purpose and not to try and win a prize.", "This is the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard and the bar is low", "NTA - sorry, what the fuck is going on?", "NTA.  Your body issues are not \u2018stupid\u2019, unlike your aunt.  Your body issues did not cause this rift, unlike your aunt.  Do not even think about subjecting yourself to people or situations that make you feel bad.  You deserve better.  The only \u2018royal\u2019 thing about your aunt is she is a royal pain in the butt.", "Is this true about the royal family ? I'm British, so obviously the royals are rammed down our throats here but i have never heard this wierd tale. Your Aunt sounds deranged, and your mother should have told her so instead of telling you to keep the peace. Stay away from this wierd gathering. NTA", "NTA. That's a terrible fucking idea for a party, and I guarantee you won't be the only guest to balk at a freaking public weigh in. The fact that your aunt knows your history makes it worst. Tbh, I'm not even pleased with how your mom reacted. I'm glad she ultimately supports you but she's still acting like your being unreasonable and causing all this drama, you aren't, your aunt and her really weird idea of a good time is", "NTA. You\u2019re probably not the only one that will refuse to step on the scale. I certainly wouldn\u2019t. And to have the weights recorded on a whiteboard for everyone to see? Nope nope nope.", "This is batshit insane an absolutely for all of the reasons already stated in the comments. Absolutely NTA, and anyone who says otherwise can fuck all the way off.", "NTA - don\u2019t go, there is no way going ends well", "NTA\n\nDon't go.", "NTA, and unless you want to be forced into a public weigh in at every event your aunt hosts for the rest of your life, you need to hold the line now.  You should also point out to your mother that participating in an activity that could lead to a relapse for you, and the development of new disordered eating habits for the other kids in your family, should be more important than keeping the peace with her sister who has an unhealthy obsession with the royal family.  Teaching the kids (and adults) in your family that gorging themselves is the best way to prove they\u2019re having a good time at a party is not healthy.", "NTA \nI wouldn't participate either. I just wouldn't go if she is insisting on it. \nI'd be surprised if you are the only one who has a problem with her bizarre idea.\nWho wants their weight posted on a white board and compared to other people jeez", "Nta I would just skip the party and avoid these toxic people", "HOLY HELL ...NTA.  I am so so so sorry that the people who are supposed to love and support you are not there for you.\n\nHere is my advice.  Do not go to the party.  This way, no one can comment on you not participating, and you get away from highly toxic and self-centered people.", "Wtf is wrong w people?? Aside from the fact that it is the stupidest thing to do to people at a party, I cannot imagine how tonight it is for OP to be dealing w this anxiety. Def NTA, and I hope you give a hard pass to this celebration for someone who is so clearly disrespecting you. Well done on all of your progress. Don\u2019t let this set you back!!", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t go to the party. Your aunt is beyond stupid for insisting on this, and your mom\u2019s an asshole who doesn\u2019t have your back for pressuring you to just go along", "Of all the traditions from the British royal family this is the one she wants to emulate? I had a quick look at the list, this was number 1, number 2 is monopoly is banned in all the households. Insert eye roll. There\u2019s something wrong with your aunt.  Don\u2019t go. Don\u2019t appease her. Let this be the hill you die on, you will not tolerate bullying and that no is a complete sentence. Go to a movie instead for escapism.", "I've never had an ed nor do I have anything about my weight that bothers me and I would still refuse to participate in this.  NTA op and hopefully aunt has more people push back on this so that she will drop it entirely or only let those that want to participate", "NTA", "Wow! NTA. I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with this myself if I were asked to participate - and I\u2019m not particularly skinny, I just don\u2019t have strong feelings about it - but what kind of complete fools don\u2019t realize that it would be a serious problem for some?", "NTA - your family sure is. \nI also have ED history and there is NO way I would go to this party.", "Why does your aunt want to emulate the habits of a notoriously dysfunctional family? Why is the person who has been hospitalised for a serious mental illness the least crazy person in this story? NTA", "You're NTA for not wanting to deal with your aunt's silly idea.\n\nHowever, your own mother gave you an out:  \n\n\n>My mom also pointed out that it might cause more gossip about my weight (and past hospitalisation) if I came to the party and refused to participate. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My mom is on my side and says she won't push me to go.\n\nYou know your aunt will push this and will shame you publicly for not wanting to participate. Are you willing to put up with that?\n\nDo your mental wellbeing a favour and skip the party.", "NTA- publically weighing guests and then encouraging them all to gorge themselves to win a competition sounds like the start of eating disorders for the rest of the family too", "Oh, what a shame. Something urgent came up on that date and you won't be able to attend after all. Hope everyone else has a great time being publicly shamed in front of all of the other guests.\n\nClaiming a migraine has always worked for me. Truth is, this sort of stress before a party would usually bring on a migraine for me, so no lying needed.\n\nYou do whatever you need to keep your dignity and your mental health, sweetheart.", "This went from being a nice family get together to a nightmare. OP for your own sanity and health you need to skip out this time. You will be under constant peer pressure the whole time. Folks will non stop talk about their weight from the time they arrive to the time they leave and beyond. This scenario will likely set you back several milestones and can lead to a more aggressive relapse. For the love of all things healthy don\u2019t go. You need not let folks know you\u2019re not coming\u2026 they can find out when you\u2019re not there. Then turn off your phone and grab some friends and have a lovely healthy evening. You are NTA but your family sure is!", "WTF? What makes anyone think that weigh-ins are a good idea? Okay, if you're an Olympic-type wrestler (h.s., college, whatever), then it makes sense, but other than that, it's just stupid.", "You\u2019re NTA but I think you\u2019re missing the mark on your mom. She isn\u2019t on your side. She tried to influence you to do something you\u2019re uncomfortable with to appease others. That\u2019s not support.", "NTA 100%\n\nI have a very good feeling that many other people don't want to participate in this.  Weight is a sensitive subject for a LOT of people, not only those with eating disorders.  And on that note, there very likely could be other attending who struggle with their weight and eating disorders.  \n\nThis weigh in thing should be an *option* not a necessity at this party.  Your aunt is not the queen and this is a strange thing to do in my opinion - like, \"look here, let's see who ate the most today!\"  That does NOT sound like fun to me!\n\nI think you gave two very healthy and appropriate options, either you don't be obligated to weigh in, or you don't attend.\n\nHold your ground OP, and don't feel bad or pressured!", "NTA - so your aunt is going to incorporate some bizarre random Royals Christmas tradition, and apply it to her birthday, and is insistent as well: that\u2019s wildly inappropriate to the point of insanity. So the family, especially women, are just going to go along with this humiliating weight quantifying fake ritual. Refuse, end of story.", "NTA.\n\nIf you want to go and have to participate in this, break the game by wearing hidden weights, and take them off before the final weigh, so you'll be the person who lost significant weight. Then you cans ay maybe this wasn't a good idea, now everyone knows this wasn't fun at all actually.", "Yta. It\u2019s just a number, why does everyone act like their weight is a nuclear launch code? I would love this party!", "NTA there\u2019s absolutely no reason for this to be a requirement, people should be able to just do it if they want.", "I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s happening to you. If you had a family member missing a leg would they berate them for not participating in the annual family foot race?? The goal of a host should be to make all guests feel welcome. I am sure many guests will have a problem with this. She should \u201csuck it up\u201d and not publicly humiliate guests in her home.", "I am not announcing my weight or putting it up on a whiteboard for all to see. You are NTA but your aunt sure is.", "Okay full stop in the self hate. You and your body have done nothing wrong. Your aunt is crazy. That is inappropriately invasive and just weird. What the hell does weight have to do with fun? I\u2019ll probably eat more the more boring the party is not the opposite. Honestly, skip it. Don\u2019t go because you\u2019re not welcome. You are simply a prop in her perfect dinner party. Don\u2019t give in. Don\u2019t feel guilty. And don\u2019t let the talk get to you. This is just what toxic families do. NTA.", "NTA. Eating disorders aside, how rude. I would refuse to do it too, honestly. I imagine her bigger hang up with you not doing it is that would open the floodgates for other people to refuse. And I guarantee you several would. Ignore your aunt, her actions are proving that she is the selfish Drama Queen. I\u2019d bet very few people are actually on her side, even if they don\u2019t voice it.", "NTA Might need to remind your aunt that Diana had an eating disorder, so this is only fun for her and not her guests", "[removed]", "This nta, op your aunt is being inappropriate, people\u2019s participation should be voluntary. I\u2019m sure you aren\u2019t the only one who won\u2019t want to \u201cweigh in\u201d. It should be if you want to participate great, it not that\u2019s fine too. I\u2019d tell people if the weigh in isn\u2019t voluntary, than you aren\u2019t going.", "She might still be able to use it! The UK colonized a lot of places and there were some issues with not being colonies anymore.", "[removed]", " There's no fucking way I'm having it sit on a whiteboard for all to see at a fucking party.", "No kidding, what a weird thing to want to put people through for the grand prize of more cake? If I showed up at a party and they asked me to do this I\u2019d be like, \u201cNo thanks, I don\u2019t want the prize so I\u2019m not participating.\u201d  And SETTING UP A WHITEBOARD with everyone\u2019s results?? Beyond tacky. I\u2019d nope right out of that party.", "I've been struggling to be ok with my weight for years.  There's no fucking way I'm having it sit on a whiteboard for all to see at a fucking party.  NTA OP.  This is so inappropriate.", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "Hidden water bottles.", "I was about to suggest this lmao", "I came looking for this. OP, dress up as Diana and, in the spirit of the event that honors the royal family, refuse to be weighed. \n\nThen become more popular with the whole world. But stay safe.", "Don't even send a card. This is abhorrent", "I don't have an ED, but I imagine just having to walk by a massive board with everyone's weight on it could be triggering?", "I was going to advise rigging the contest too!!", "Huh? No", ">Mom can enforce, or not, her own boundaries. Her salvation is in her own hands.\n\nIf Mom wanted to be supportive, one thing she could do is say that she also would not take part in the weighing. This would take the pressure off the OP and establish for everyone else there that the weighing should be *optional*.\n\nMy bet is that there are other people who would prefer not to be weighed who would leap at the chance to not participate.", "NTA your aunt is way off base! Nobody wants to get weighed publicly!", "It being a contest makes it extra weird that the aunt cares this much about everyone participating- if not everyone participates the aunt has a better chance of winning herself, does she not want to have the best time?", "Yes, I\u2019ll bet the party will be just the aunt and her husband. Who wants their weight on a whiteboard for everyone to talk about and compare, that\u2019s insane. It\u2019s the opposite of fun!", "Agreed! I'm fat and hate being weighed. In fact, I avoid it totally except for doctor's appointments and, even then, I look away and tell them not to tell me my weight.", "I don\u2019t have an eating disorder, and I would never agree to weigh myself in that way, it\u2019s just super weird. Aunt sounds like a compete asshole", "This is what I would do", " Most people will hate this. Idk what the heck your aunt was thinking. Multiple people will not be on board. She is setting herself up for much more drama I am sure", "Jsyk: you have the right to refuse to be weighed entirely at a doctor's appointment. It is almost never relevant information to your healthcare and your providers don't need to know if you don't want them to. Only time it could be relevant is with things like anesthesia/plan B birth control, and you're not getting surgery every time you go in for a checkup.", "I\u2019m willing to bet the aunt is the \u201cperfect\u201d weight.", "The only caveat I would place on weighing at the doctor's is if there have been unexplained and significant changes in weight. Those are usually signs of underlying issues, like cancer, diabetes, and thyroid issues, for example. \n\nOtherwise, i tell all my docs that i don't want to be weighed or have conversations about my weight unless it is germane to the reason for the visit. It's in my chart, and I've skipped that part except for my annual checkup.", "Probably, but most people who fit the height/weight charts wouldn't think up such a stupid (and mean-spirited) thing.\n\nHas anyone else ever heard that Britain's royal family does that? Not important, I realize, as it's a majorly stupid thing to do, but it's so bizarre that I want to know."]}
