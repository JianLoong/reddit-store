Though, you should really communicate with her on this because in the end, it\u2019s pictures of herself and it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s your phone.

I think this is a very selfish & immature request on her part. The photos you took of her are yours now. It is cruel and dehumanizing for her to want you to forget her entirely along with all the good times you had.

Shes not your gf anymore, and she is uncomfortable with those photos being on your phone, clearly they are of some sort of nature even if theyre not nudes or inherently sexual, if she is able to say her other friends wouldnt have those photos, and you admitted that at least one could be considered sexual.

Don't even go through the charade of deleting to appease her, it's done walk away and stop responding", "I\u2019m going NTA, mostly.

I know this isn\u2019t \u201cis it legal,\u201d it\u2019s aita, but I still think this fundamental fact has some bearing on your question.

Also massive yikes for saying you support people keeping others nudes outside of a relationship", "Your own historical example betrays you, I also dated in the before-times and destroying photos of your ex was seen as extreme.
