Even professional photographers own the photos they take.", "If you have Google Photos or something similar, let them upload then remove them from your phone. You may see them later, but as time moves on you'll probably find you don't want to look at them, that they won't be that important to you. I have a *few* photos with exes in them, and they're mostly only important memories to me because other friends or important events are also in them. You're hurting now, but she's asking you to move on, and the longer you drag this out the more it will hurt.\n\nSorry about your breakup OP, I hope you find the happiness you deserve.", "NAH. I think you both should sit down and decide which photos you can keep 'cause you have a right to keep few memories.

Meet in the middle.", "I\u2019m on the Fence on this one. On one hand I can totally understand why u don\u2019t wanna delete the pictures and videos because there memories. But on the other hand it is also kinda a asshole move to keep pictures of someone who doesn\u2019t want you to have them anymore. Part of me is also thinking you guys just broke up maybe she\u2019s speaking outta anger and pettiness at the moment. \n\nI would give it some time. If you guys don\u2019t communicate or revisit the subject in a couple weeks then I would just delete them. It\u2019s too much drama.

So more info on what's making her upset, please.\n\nI would keep a couple of generic photos as she described but delete the rest. It's creepy to keep photos you know upsets someone else.

If they are throwing that big of a fit, I would edit their face to where their likeness is no longer visible.", "NAH. I understand that you would like to still keep the memories for a while until you\u2019ve finally processed everything in the break up. Though, you should really communicate with her on this because in the end, it\u2019s pictures of herself and it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s your phone. Whether or not they are sexual, I think it\u2019s fair that she wouldn\u2019t want photos of her to stay in your phone after a break up. I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re an AH for not wanting to delete them or feeling rushed by her request. If I\u2019m being honest, I would hold on for a while before removing them all. I just think it would be good to regard her suggestion and settle on an agreement. I hope you can move on from this OP. Good luck!", "YTA. Doesn\u2019t matter what your rights are. Morally, if someone asks you to delete photos and videos of them, it\u2019s the decent thing to comply. If any of them are group photos or there are other people in the video, or if there\u2019s vacation pictures where she is for example standing in front of a building and you don\u2019t have a picture of the building without her, those would be ok to keep.", "NTA, I had a messy breakup with my ex but I never would have demanded he delete innocent photos of me off of his phone despite how upset and angry at him I was, that\u2019s just immature. It\u2019s up to each of you to independently decide if you keep those memories or not.", "YTA.\n\nSeeing as they're normal photos you can keep them for yourself as a memory, but you always delete off of social media if someone asks you to. That's just common curtesy. I'd delete photos of my friends in a heartbeat if they asked me to do it, because it's not my place to decide which photos of them are/aren't public.", "NTA - if this were 20 years ago, you would have analog photos & videos of her and it would be widely regarded as crazy of her to ask you to burn all your photos of her. I think this is a very selfish & immature request on her part. The photos you took of her are yours now. It is cruel and dehumanizing for her to want you to forget her entirely along with all the good times you had. She seems like an excessively controlling narcissist and needs to realize that the world does not revolve around her. At least you escaped having a relationship with this unreasonable woman!", "Hold up wtf??? Why is everyone supporting this?? YTA. Shes not your gf anymore, and she is uncomfortable with those photos being on your phone, clearly they are of some sort of nature even if theyre not nudes or inherently sexual, if she is able to say her other friends wouldnt have those photos, and you admitted that at least one could be considered sexual. Delete the photos, wtf", "YTA. Delete them. If there are any pictures of her and she wants them deleted, do so. I think there is a lot of info missing from this post but from the little you gave, save yourself the future headache and just delete them.", "YTA. Its a bit hard to decide, but as a person she still has the right to her image. Maybe dont keep with you the pictures of *her* specifically, like a selfie.\n\nIf you didnt want someone with your picture, you'd understand. Personally, I only send pics of me to someone I trully trust, I dont even have profile pictures online. In my personal opinion, you should delete.", "\"it felt like she just wants me to forget everything we had.\"\n\nOf course she does. Because you're her ex.

You save yourself a while lot of bother by not being an asshole here.", "YTA. If she specifically asked you to delete them, there\u2019s probably a reason. Whether that\u2019s just because or because she thinks you might be creepy or something, it\u2019s still her choice. You\u2019re both young, so I understand that it hurts, but you probably won\u2019t want to look at those pictures soon anyways.

Do so, while she watches. But first copy them somewhere else, like to a computer, in private.\n\nNTA.", "NTA  \nits your phone, she has no authority over it.

I think you should delete some soon, but keep a few for memories sake.", "NTA there is nothing wrong with keeping the pictures.

You are allowed to keep you memorized, but for your own personal ability to move on faster, blocking immediate access to ruminate helps.", "NTA you took the pictures so they are yours to do what you want with them.", "NTA On your phone you decide if you keep them. And honestly, even if they were nudes, never send someone pics or videos you don't expect them to keep if the relationship ends. Now obviously should never share those kinds of things with others, especially online. And I personally wouldn't keep that kind of content, would be awkward if another partner saw them. But yea, your phone your call.", "NTA\n\nMaybe offer to show that you don't have anything sexual of her.

But seems senseless to cart them around, next to your heart, on the phone, after breakup.", "YTA\n\nTo me this is like taking photos and videos of strangers. If someone asked you to delete a picture of THEM and you say no it\u2019s just\u2026. nasty. \u201cI still like her\u201d that\u2019s great but you\u2019re not together anymore, I see this a lot where people don\u2019t want to delete photos of their exes after they were asked and it\u2019s used more of as a weapon. You need to find a compromise like maybe only one photo or something", "I agree, I think nudes change things but harmless memories should be remembered as they are part of your life :)", "I would like to add a different perspective here. If OP's ex girlfriend belongs to a conservative family  from a different culture where dating is frowned upon then her request would make a lot of sense.

So if she belongs to that kind of background OP delete everything about that relationship.", "Copy photos to the computer. Make a show off deleting off your phone in front of her.
