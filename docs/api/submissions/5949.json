Your son is at an age where he tests boundaries and sees how far he can go before running into said boundaries. If you're afraid of making him cry at that age because someone told him \"no\" or \"stop\", there's a good chance he'll grow up to be an unbearable person.", "YTA - I think kicking your sister out rather than taking her aside was extreme and a bit of coddling towards your son. How did your sister ask the first time? Is your husband so impressionable that he never yells at your son, but at your sister's influence, he did? That part seemed odd to me.\n\nYTA - keeping Dad out, essentially controlling a part of their relationship made me uncomfortable just reading it.  You stepped on Dad's toes and authority (as Dad) and that's something your son is learning.  \n\nYour title is telling as well - \"made... cry\" - 2-yr-olds are gonna cry.  This situation was not a case of evil monsters ganging up on your son.\n\nI do agree that yelling at the kid/ talking harshly when he is just being a kid is not okay. But it sounds like you weren't in the room, so how do you know what their tone was? Or did you base your judgment on your son's response?", "YTA.  Your son was asked multiple times to settle down\u2026 and did not. Should dad have raised his voice that much\u2026. Maybe not.  But if you side with your son when he\u2019s just been disciplined, against the disciplining parent, and then demonstrate to your toddler how to hold a grudge and manipulate the situation\u2026. You\u2019re going to have some tough teenage years ahead of you when he dishes back at you everything you\u2019re teaching him to serve.\n\nDad should have gotten the opportunity to participate after.", "I\u2019m not sure what the issue is here?  Your son was making too much noise and was told off? It\u2019s not the end of the world - everything shouldn\u2019t be revolving around him and so what if he was addressed sternly?  YTA", "YTA. The child was told not to do something and disobeyed. What your husband did by giving it some consequences is called \u201cparenting\u201d and ultimately it is good for your son. \n\nOne day he will need to follow an instruction for his own safety (\u201cStop!\u201d). You had better hope he has learned how to do that by then.", "YTA\n\nYeah parents get loud sometimes, and it's not nice or a good thing, but your son also needs to learn how to listen.\n\nIf it was in a dangerous situation outside, and your son doesn't listen to your husband, it could have cost your son's life.\n\nDaddy needs to apologize, and explain to son why he got loud. He also should learn to squat down and get his son's attention, then saying he should stop.\n\nBut you, you decided to overrule your husband's parenting, and also try to keep 'harm' away from a kid by sugar coating the world for him.\n\nYour son won't be damaged for life.\n\nTalk to him why listening to his parents is important. As well as getting the noise down when told/asked! Basic decency even a toddler can start to learn.\n\nIt will take years until he fully understands, and he will have to re-learn it all as a teenager, but at least he should learn to listen to a **STOP** asap.", "Wow way to teach you toddler that what dad says isn\u2019t important. It is perfectly fine to to whatever he wants and that even if someone else gives consequences for his action you will just come in and be a jerk to everyone until he is happy again.\nYou need to apologize to you husband and sister and do better.", "YTA. You\u2019re not the only parent, or the only parent who\u2019s opinion matters. That\u2019s the path to divorce.", "YTA. I don't think your sister or husband did anything wrong. You sound overprotective.", "Yta \n\n\nSister and husband were having an important conversation. Even if at home, your son have ho learn how to behave in some situations. What if they were talking about something really emotional or your husband was talking to some other stranger about important things about your family future?\n\nThey haven't slapped him, only told him to behave, so you overreacted.", "[removed]", "YTA. Yelling at kids is bad and your husband should be aware of his emotions before projecting them onto a literal toddler. HOWEVER you not allowing your husband to apologise to him, soothe him, heal and have their routine is out of line.", "YTA. Your husband is allowed to discipline your son. The reaction from your son shows that your husband has never really raised his voice to him, which is probably why your son kept pushing boundaries when he was told by his dad and his aunt to settle down. Not saying that parents should yell at their children, but it\u2019s clear your son hasn\u2019t had to deal with a raised or stern voice. It always makes a kid super sad when they get in \u201creal\u201d trouble for the first time. Instead of explaining to your son why he got into trouble, you undermined your husband in front of him and have now made your son believe that his father shouldn\u2019t discipline him. \n\nYou owe your husband an apology. You should also apologize to your sister. It sounds like you were totally out of line.", "YTA. Excluding your husband instead of explaining to your son why he raised his voice and that he is sorry is likely going to hurt more than help. You turned it into an \"us vs. him\" when you could have easily said \"Dad is sorry, but not listening hurts his feelings sometimes too. He will not yell, but please listen to mom and dad when they ask you to slow down.\"", "[removed]", "YTA. Your son needed discipline and 2 yo is old enough to be taught to keep it down while adults are talking. There are certainly better ways to do it but your sister is under a lot of stress and needed help.", "Am I the only one that's thinking the sister and the husband are going to end up spending so much alone time together while he's so graciously helping  her fix her life that they end up catching feelings.", "ESH. Y\u2019all should have figured a time for the husband to talk to his sister when you or someone could watch the child. The sister is going through a very rough time and snapped out of frustration, maybe she can apologize when she is in a better headspace, maybe y\u2019all just move on. The dad lost his patience and snapped at the kid, it happens.He apologized. You decided to be petty and prevent him from putting the child to bed, this not only hurt the husband but your child. I\u2019m going to assume you probably didn\u2019t try and encourage your child to go be with dad so he could apologize, again this is hurtful to your child. Everyone else made a mistake out of frustration, you were intentional in your mistakes. ESH but you might be the suckiest.", "ESH. Husband and you need to agree on boundaries because he seemed completely fine with your sister overstepping hers and making demands in your house. You refusing your husband, your child's father, later on, is weird.", "If your kid was still a little fearful of daddy then maybe you did okay with not letting bedtime be normal but I\u2019m guessing the only reason kid cried was because daddy spooked by yelling you are probably TA but there is an argument that no one was parenting the kid because you were busy and they were busy so ESH is only fair", "ESH - aunt shouldn\u2019t have behaved that way, dad shouldn\u2019t have yelled, and you shouldn\u2019t be coddling in the moment and let your son know appropriately he needs to listen when asked something. No one handled this well and all can be true.\n\nI will however say to those who are chiding OP for asking the husband to leave bedtime. This kid was obviously upset, no matter how irrationally so (duh a 2yo) but this child is allowed to want space away to calm down as well.. \n\nMom should do the normal routine, no extra cuddles or anything, because he also did not listen and that\u2019s also wrong but this can be a lesson in no one handling things well, and if mom does something in the future then she would let dad handle as needed as well. But it\u2019s not going to settle an illogical toddler down to have the reason they are crying and likely scared of (never yells but did + obvious size difference) there for bedtime!\n\n..which I\u2019m no expert, but you kind of don\u2019t want the kid anxious or scared if you\u2019re trying to get them to sleep.", "ESH this entire thing was handled poorly. While you\u2019re husband was wrong for yelling at babe. It was unnecessary to kick your sister out. You should\u2019ve taken babe to another room, to help calm him down. Kicking her out and excluding your husband from the bedtime routine was an overreaction. Parents aren\u2019t perfect but you didn\u2019t even give him an opportunity to correct his mistake and apologize. You and your husband need to get on the same page regarding your parenting styles.", "NTA I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for a parent to use anger as a way of getting a child to do or to stop doing a certain action. It\u2019s true that kids are gonna cry for unjustified reasons, so If your husband had told your child \u201cno\u201d in a calm voice, and then your son cried simply by being told to stop running around, in that case I would be on the side of you husband and sister. But if your son cried as a result of hearing anger in an adult\u2019s voice, I think there are better ways of handling this situation and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong of you to be concerned by that.", "NTA!!!! Who are these people who are saying that you are? Have they never seen a normal energetic toddler? If what your hubby and sister were doing was so important that it could not be interrupted, then maybe they should have done the paperwork outside the house or wait until you were available. GOOD FOR YOU for kicking your entitled sister out. Also, now your hubby learned that if he yells at his kid UNPROVOKED (cause your kid was just doing normal play stuff), said kid is going to be scared of him. Freaking definitely NTA!! Your sister is (and your hubby too a little).", "YTA. This is going to come down to parenting styles. If the kid was acting unruly and needed to be disciplined, then so be it.\n\nYou could have simply been like, 'Hey I know he was being annoying, but cmon guys please don't yell at the little guy like that.\" A quick sorry and everyone could go about their business. \n\nKicking his sister out and then not allowing your husband to spend some time with your son to amend things and get back on track seems like overreacting.", "YTA of course it wasn't good that your husband snapped at your kid. But he asked the kid multiple times to not do something and he got frustrated and he snapped and told him loudly. \n\nParents are people with feelings, frustrations, and a patience that isn't always full. expecting your husband to always be perfect and showing your literal toddler that you don't side with your husband whenever the kid does something out of line will bite you and your child in the back. \n\nYour husband snapped, he apologised to your kid, but because of your petty behaviour he wasn't able to show your kid that just because daddy got angry he still loves him the same and still wants to spend time with him and still wants to cuddle, hug, put him to bed.\n\nYou're not doing your child any favours by being this unforgiving for any little mistake your husband makes and showing your child that you and his other parent aren't on the same side and aren't supporting each other over even just little things and ultimately you're teaching your child that you don't trust your husband's parenting and that your kid doesn't have to take dad seriously because you don't, either. \n\nAgain, of course you shouldn't shout at your child. Of course you shouldn't snap at your kid. But even the best parent in the world doesn't do anything perfectly, and you're damaging your kids relationship to his dad by showing him actively that you don't trust dad's decisions, don't support dad in how he raises his son, and ultimately walk over him when he disciplines your kid.\n\nAlso, toddlers cry. My toddler cried the other day because I didn't let him play with the toaster. Would you have thrown a fit and not let me take care of my kid anymore cause I made him cry by not letting him stick the fork in the toaster, too?", "NTA - as a mother of 4 and grandmother of 6, there are several troubling things I see here.  Hubby and sis should not be having serious discussions with a 2 year old running around.  I\u2019m surprised they couldn\u2019t wait 15 minutes for OP to come out of the shower to have their discussion.  Secondly, two year olds are loud and lack impulse control.  Instead of yelling at him repeatedly, redirect his energy.  Get him a toy to play with, a book to \u201cread\u201d or even a TV show to watch if the conversation couldn\u2019t wait for 15 minutes.  Thirdly, OP\u2019s sister needs to sort her self out without interfering with OP\u2019s household.  \n\nIf dad never yells at the two year old, that was probably scary for him.  Sis needs to check herself and understand that she\u2019s not the center of attention all the time and sometimes a two year old needs attention. \n\nFor all you who are saying that the two year old needs \u201cboundaries\u201d, yelling is not the way to accomplish that.  Redirection is a much better, kinder way to handle it.", "Yeah you are being way overprotective and treating your husband like he doesn\u2019t have an equal say in parenting. You invalidated him as a dad. Also your sister snapped at an understandably rowdy 2yearold. Hardly a crime worthy of being kicked out. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYour SIL and your husband were discussing serious and stressful matters.  They lost their tempers.  Now, while I'm sure you n e v e r have lost your temper it does happen--even to the best parent.  \n\nYou way over reacted.", "I feel like there's more to the story in your husband's side. If that behavior is way out of him norm, I'd guess something pushed him to it. And I'd would want to know why. Was the discussion tense? Did he feel pressured by sister to calm your son? If that's the case, she needs to understand that your son doing his thing is part of coming over and she needs to deal with it or not come over.", "I feel like most people commenting here haven't been around many 2 year olds. \n\n2 year olds don't follow instructions well. Just as a general rule. Parents should not be surprised by this. \n\nIf dad needed quiet, then he sets up the guiderails to help his 2 year old succeed. You need quiet? Get out the play doh, or the blocks, or the (fill in quiet time activity here). You don't scream at them to be quiet because **shockingly** they're fucking 2 and they have the memory to match. \n\nParenting means setting your children up as best as possible to meet age appropriate expectations.

Aunts should be able to discipline their nieces/nephews, was your son just being his normal self, yes, was he in the wrong, no. But when a child is asked to do something then they need to do what they are being asked (assuming it's reasonable), the same as if you boss, or your parents asked you to do something. Was your husband wrong to raise his voice, probably, but your son was already asked twice to settle down for a while.", "YTA,\n\nSnapping at a two-year-old for behaving like a two-year-old was developmentally inappropriate and doesn't have the desired effect, and your husband knew it as soon as he did it.

If this is how yall enforce boundaries then your son needs to learn to anticipate and cope with this type of reaction from your husband. \n\nIf not, then N T A. It sounds like your husband snapped because he was stressed out trying to parent his child and talk with the sister at the same time. If yall usually discipline differently, your husband should've taken a break talking with the sister to put his son in time out/give him a talking to/take away a toy/whatever it is yall usually do to discipline. It's not incumbent upon a 2 year old to recognize when their caregivers are too stressed to actively parent and adjust their behavior to suit the parent during those times. If this is the scenario, I think you were right to kick out your sister; your husband didn't handle his stressors like an adult and that was to the detriment of your child so you stepped in to shut the situation down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying either school of thought on disciplining a child is right or wrong--different parenting styles will fit different families better. However, it is wrong to arbitrarily undermine one parent when they're enforcing agreed upon/normal discipline. It is also is wrong to lash out at a toddler at random and excuse the outburst under the guise of \"boundaries\" unless you're trying to teach the kid the \"boundary\" of constantly walking on eggshells. \n\nAgain, not saying it's necessarily wrong to take an aggressive/stern tone when disciplining a child, but in an ideal world the tone should be taken consistently and in order to discipline, not at random whenever the parent has an emotional outburst. Obviously, parent's are human so it doesn't always happen that way, but it sounds like your husband was willing to excuse the outburst as normal until you stepped in to shut the situation down.", "WAY over-reacting Mom...it's not the end of the world if your little precious ends up crying.", "Nta I think there's a lot of bad parents in these comments.

The kid cried in fear. Anyone condoning instilling fear as a form of consequence is an ah. \n\nDad also can't force the kid to just move on. If my husband shouts at me in anger he doesn't get to decide when I forgive him or stop feeling afraid. I don't think it is out of line for Dad to be excluded from bath time if the 2 year old was still upset. It is totally healthy and appropriate for people to have space to process their feelings, even 2 year olds. \n\nWe don't know the tone or the body language but we know the 2 year old was scared and mom was mad about it. As someone who was frequently afraid of my parents and was shouted at often I imagine what the tone was like and it is unacceptable. People are going on and on about how kids need consequences or they are unprepared for the real world, well part if that is modeling appropriate relationships. There is virtually no other relationship where the bigger person shouts and intimidates the smaller one and reasonable people expect the victim to have no feelings over it and in fact blame the victim for it. \n\nIf this was a husband shouting at his wife rather than a parent at their kid no one would condone it.

You clearly just care about your kid and made sure your husband knows you don't support him yelling at your kid. Your sister also has no right to yell at your kid, and no right to try and parent them.

Yelling at kids is even pretty bad as it can damage them emotionally and leave long-lasting effects (again I've experienced this first-hand myself)", "NTA\n\nas a mom I know I hate to kake my baby cry before bedtime. WTF can't they can just something to play if they can't handle run and spinning", "ESH \n\nI don\u2019t understand all the YTAs. Screaming while parenting can happen we all can feel overwhelmed and raising a child isn\u2019t easy. But screaming and dad has the dad voice and \u201cauthority\u201d is outdated. 2 year old children can do and understand more than we think but at the same time they are unable to regulate some things for example emotions - that\u2019s why in a lot of situations screaming teaches the child just to suppress the visual part of their emotions and they are on their own. While adults might not always be in the mood or have the time for it, more often than not distracting a child is more efficient than screaming. And being quiet or playing quiet is something children have to learn (at least most of them and for them to be able to do it for an extended amount of time). If your child never has to be quiet you can\u2019t expect it to suddenly behave a specific way just because you screamed or just told him to do it. \n\nI think ESH because I get the felling op overreacted a little - talking with husband and sister would have been needed but denying your husband access to the child is wrong. Both of you should talk, he should understand what he did was not good and afterwards you should help your husband and child to reconnect. I kinda get the impression op is most annoyed about the changed behavior of husband while sister was there (and might question why hubby behaved differently than he would normally)/ or possibly the sister asks for to much help and is around to much and that is annoying op.\nDepending on the relationship of sister and child she was way out of line if they aren\u2019t very close. Even if they are close it isn\u2019t her place to \u201cparent\u201d when one of the parents is present in my opinion. \nThey might have had an important discussion but I doubt this was the only time and place they could discuss the topic - if it was that important and they needed all their brain juices and an quite environment they could have waited until op was ready with their shower. \n\nFor the husband to lose his temper when he normally dosen\u2019t lose it at the child could be an indication for a few things \n- he could be overwhelmed/stressed with the amount of help SIL needs (but suppresses his annoyance because \u201cfamily\u201d)\n- he wanted to impress SIL because he is a strong man that has his child under control or enough power over (than there might be something going on between these two)\n- he simply priorities his SIL over his child \n- he could be stressed because of external factors \n\n(No matter what exactly is the reason talking about it and trying to find out would be good in my opinion). \n\nDon\u2019t make it an us vs husband situation.

Now, the kid has the expectation that dad does not apologize or comfort him, and mom is the only one that needs to be listened to.

Fine. \nActing as a facilitator to an age appropriate conversation about why your husband should have handled things differently? Fine. \n\nEncouraging your son to avoid making up with your husband and reinforcing the idea that if he gets in trouble with his dad he can come running to you for comfort and validation? Very wrong and damaging to your son. \n\nFor the record I don't think you were the AH to your sister - while she deserves empathy for the situation, she needed to understand that your husband was not available to fully commit to that conversation at that time as he was responsible for watching your son. She needed to coordinate with you and your husband for a time and place where you could occupy your son in one area and your husband could help her in another. Taking her annoyance out on a toddler wasn't acceptable. \n\nYour husband is a more difficult person to assess here. On the one hand, he shouldn't have randomly scolded your two year old for not being able to understand why the home rules have changed out of the blue and defaulting to the normal home rules. At two, that is a reasonable mistake to make and should be patiently reiterated not screamed at. \n\nBut again, it's not fair to your husband that he's been prevented from making up with his son.", "YTA.

YTA.", "Your husband may have been in the wrong for yelling if all your son was doing was running around like normal, but for everything after that YTA. Kicking your sister out is extreme, and so is excluding your husband from the regular bedtime routine. People are going to yell at your kid, and your not going to like it, and nor will your son, but teaching him that mum will swoop in and ban everyone from his vicinity for it is not helpful. If your son didn\u2019t want your husband to put him to bed, he could have told him.\nWhen my husband oversteps with the yelling, I might pull him aside and let him know it was a bit much, but it\u2019s also his responsibility to fix it with our daughter so they can have a healthy functioning relationship.

I learnt that I couldn't trust my own parents, I couldn't depend on them, they were not safe people.\nThe amount of people who think yelling at a child to stop is appropriate in any circumstance that is not life or death, crazy.

Op was the first to admit that dad raising his voice was extremely unusual for him (in fact he \"never did\").\n\nAs a mom of 4 and being a grandmother I'm sure you have seen your fair share of family issues and pains, I'm sure that you can appreciate that anyone will snap under a difficult situation. Both adults had told multiple times the kid to stop. I noticed 2 things here:\n\n1) why did you assume OP was in the shower when sis came over and not OP went in the shower while she was there? That seems way more likely. Plus OP only came out when she heard dad yell and nk. That means she could have come out earlier, I doubt that she was done on that exact moment. She knew sister and husband were having an important conversation and heard that kiddo was causing trouble. If it were me I would have gone to help. \n\n2) Dad snapped, and as many comments said, it wasn't cool. But kicking him out is waaaayyyyy overshooting it. Especially if it wasn't that bad and per Op's comment- kid started crying because he was surprised, not because dad is abusive. He only raised his voice and said \"stop\", that's entirely different than screaming at him on top of his lungs for 5 minutes. It was probably more traumatic for the 2 yro seeing mom kick dad out and keeping him away for him. I assure you at that age the incident is forgotten after a good apology and 5 minutes. Op should have gone in, calmly asked if everything was fine, asked Op to apologize to son and then told them that she'd take son so they can concentrate.\n\nOp's husband is a good dad. If he's never yelled he must be. You know how much 2 year old can be trying, so the fact that not once before in 2 years he did what most parents do- raise his voice, it must mean that he's not unreasonable or overly emotional.\n\nIf you have raised 4 kids without not once snapping ever, then I both command you for being patient but also I know that you for sure were privileged. Both must be true for a parent to never ever snap.", "I hate parents like this. My sister and BIL are like this with their 4 year old. The child is literally a hurricane.
