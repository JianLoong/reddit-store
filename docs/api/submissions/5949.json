Your son is at an age where he tests boundaries and sees how far he can go before running into said boundaries. If you're afraid of making him cry at that age because someone told him \"no\" or \"stop\", there's a good chance he'll grow up to be an unbearable person.", "YTA - I think kicking your sister out rather than taking her aside was extreme and a bit of coddling towards your son. How did your sister ask the first time? Is your husband so impressionable that he never yells at your son, but at your sister's influence, he did? That part seemed odd to me.\n\nYTA - keeping Dad out, essentially controlling a part of their relationship made me uncomfortable just reading it.  You stepped on Dad's toes and authority (as Dad) and that's something your son is learning.  \n\nYour title is telling as well - \"made... cry\" - 2-yr-olds are gonna cry.  This situation was not a case of evil monsters ganging up on your son.\n\nI do agree that yelling at the kid/ talking harshly when he is just being a kid is not okay. But it sounds like you weren't in the room, so how do you know what their tone was? Or did you base your judgment on your son's response?", "YTA.  Your son was asked multiple times to settle down\u2026 and did not. Should dad have raised his voice that much\u2026. Maybe not.  But if you side with your son when he\u2019s just been disciplined, against the disciplining party, and then demonstrate to a toddler how to hold a grudge\u2026. You\u2019re going to have some tough teenage years ahead of you.\n\nDad should have gotten the opportunity to participate after.", "I\u2019m not sure what the issue is here?  Your son was making too much noise and was told off? It\u2019s not the end of the world - everything shouldn\u2019t be revolving around him and so what if he was addressed sternly?  YTA", "YTA. The child was told not to do something and disobeyed. What your husband did by giving it some consequences is called \u201cparenting\u201d and ultimately it is good for your son. \n\nOne day he will need to follow an instruction for his own safety (\u201cStop!\u201d). You had better hope he has learned how to do that by then.", "YTA\n\nYeah parents get loud sometimes, and it's not nice or a good thing, but your son also needs to learn how to listen.\n\nIf it was in a dangerous situation outside, and your son doesn't listen to your husband, it could have cost your son's life.\n\nDaddy needs to apologize, and explain to son why he got loud. He also should learn to squat down and get his son's attention, then saying he should stop.\n\nBut you, you decided to overrule your husband's parenting, and also try to keep 'harm' away from a kid by sugar coating the world for him.\n\nYour son won't be damaged for life.\n\nTalk to him why listening to his parents is important. As well as getting the noise down when told/asked! Basic decency even a toddler can start to learn.\n\nIt will take years until he fully understands, and he will have to re-learn it all as a teenager, but at least he should learn to listen to a **STOP** asap.", "Wow way to teach you toddler that what dad says isn\u2019t important. It is perfectly fine to to whatever he wants and that even if someone else gives consequences for his action you will just come in and be a jerk to everyone until he is happy again.\nYou need to apologize to you husband and sister and do better.", "YTA. You\u2019re not the only parent, or the only parent who\u2019s opinion matters. That\u2019s the path to divorce.", "YTA. I don't think your sister or husband did anything wrong. You sound overprotective.", "Yta \n\n\nSister and husband were having an important conversation. Even if at home, your son have ho learn how to behave in some situations. What if they were talking about something really emotional or your husband was talking to some other stranger about important things about your family future?\n\nThey haven't slapped him, only told him to behave, so you overreacted.", "You're fucking mental lady, your kid needs to learn boundaries and this is apart of the process. Absolute asshole you are.", "YTA. Yelling at kids is bad and your husband should be aware of his emotions before projecting them onto a literally toddler. HOWEVER you not allowing your husband to apologise to him, soothe him, heal and have their routine is out of line.", "YTA. Your husband is allowed to discipline your son. The reaction from your son shows that your husband has never really raised his voice to him, which is probably why your son kept pushing boundaries when he was told by his dad and his aunt to settle down. Not saying that parents should yell at their children, but it\u2019s clear your son hasn\u2019t had to deal with a raised or stern voice. It always makes a kid super sad when they get in \u201creal\u201d trouble for the first time. Instead of explaining to your son why he got into trouble, you undermined your husband in front of him and have now made your son believe that his father shouldn\u2019t discipline him. \n\nYou owe your husband an apology. You should also apologize to your sister. It sounds like you were totally out of line.", "YTA. Excluding your husband instead of explaining to your son why he raised his voice and that he is sorry is likely going to hurt more than help. You turned it into an \"us vs. him\" when you could have easily said \"Dad is sorry, but not listening hurts his feelings sometimes too. He will not yell, but please listen to mom and dad when they ask you to slow down.\"", "YTA. \n\nFirst of all, your sister didn't even participate in the scolding that led to your son crying. Per you she simply asked him to stop. \n\nSecondly, your son was told repeatedly to stop and refused. So yes, your husband scolded him. Does your son often refuse to listen to his dad? Two year olds are stubborn and will often do as they please and it seems you are okay with that behavior. That does not mean your husband is. \n\nAnd lastly, if your husband and sister were having an important adult conversation why were you in the shower instead of helping to wrangle your Tasmanian Devil?", "YTA. Your son needed discipline and 2 yo is old enough to be taught to keep it down while adults are talking. There are certainly better ways to do it but your sister is under a lot of stress and needed help.", "Am I the only one that's thinking the sister and the husband are going to end up spending so much alone time together while he's so graciously helping  her fix her life that they end up catching feelings.", "ESH. Y\u2019all should have figured a time for the husband to talk to his sister when you or someone could watch the child. The sister is going through a very rough time and snapped out of frustration, maybe she can apologize when she is in a better headspace, maybe y\u2019all just move on. The dad lost his patience and snapped at the kid, it happens.He apologized. You decided to be petty and prevent him from putting the child to bed, this not only hurt the husband but your child. I\u2019m going to assume you probably didn\u2019t try and encourage your child to go be with dad so he could apologize, again this is hurtful to your child. Everyone else made a mistake out of frustration, you were intentional in your mistakes. ESH but you might be the suckiest.", "ESH. Husband and you need to agree on boundaries because he seemed completely fine with your sister overstepping hers and making demands in your house. You refusing your husband, your child's father, later on, is weird.", "If your kid was still a little fearful of daddy then maybe you did okay with not letting bedtime be normal but I\u2019m guessing the only reason kid cried was because daddy spooked by yelling you are probably TA but there is an argument that no one was parenting the kid because you were busy and they were busy so ESH is only fair", "ESH - aunt shouldn\u2019t have behaved that way, dad shouldn\u2019t have yelled, and you shouldn\u2019t be coddling in the moment and let your son know appropriately he needs to listen when asked something. No one handled this well and all can be true.\n\nI will however say to those who are chiding OP for asking the husband to leave bedtime. This kid was obviously upset, no matter how irrationally so (duh a 2yo) but this child is allowed to want space away to calm down as well.. \n\nMom should do the normal routine, no extra cuddles or anything, because he also did not listen and that\u2019s also wrong but this can be a lesson in no one handling things well, and if mom does something in the future then she would let dad handle as needed as well. But it\u2019s not going to settle an illogical toddler down to have the reason they are crying and likely scared of (never yells but did + obvious size difference) there for bedtime!\n\n..which I\u2019m no expert, but you kind of don\u2019t want the kid anxious or scared if you\u2019re trying to get them to sleep.", "ESH this entire thing was handled poorly. While you\u2019re husband was wrong for yelling at babe. It was unnecessary to kick your sister out. You should\u2019ve taken babe to another room, to help calm him down. Kicking her out and excluding your husband from the bedtime routine was an overreaction. Parents aren\u2019t perfect but you didn\u2019t even give him an opportunity to correct his mistake and apologize. You and your husband need to get on the same page regarding your parenting styles.", "NTA I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for a parent to use anger as a way of getting a child to do or to stop doing a certain action. It\u2019s true that kids are gonna cry for unjustified reasons, so If your husband had told your child \u201cno\u201d in a calm voice, and then your son cried simply by being told to stop running around, in that case I would be on the side of you husband and sister. But if your son cried as a result of hearing anger in an adult\u2019s voice, I think there are better ways of handling this situation and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong of you to be concerned by that.", "NTA!!!! Who are these people who are saying that you are? Have they never seen a normal energetic toddler? If what your hubby and sister were doing was so important that it could not be interrupted, then maybe they should have done the paperwork outside the house or wait until you were available. GOOD FOR YOU for kicking your entitled sister out. Also, now your hubby learned that if he yells at his kid UNPROVOKED (cause your kid was just doing normal play stuff), said kid is going to be scared of him. Freaking definitely NTA!! Your sister is (and your hubby too a little).", "YTA. This is going to come down to parenting styles. If the kid was acting unruly and needed to be disciplined, then so be it.\n\nYou could have simply been like, 'Hey I know he was being annoying, but cmon guys please don't yell at the little guy like that.\" A quick sorry and everyone could go about their business. \n\nKicking his sister out and then not allowing your husband to spend some time with your son to amend things and get back on track seems like overreacting.", "YTA of course it wasn't good that your husband snapped at your kid. But he asked the kid multiple times to not do something and he got frustrated and he snapped and told him loudly. \n\nParents are people with feelings, frustrations, and a patience that isn't always full. expecting your husband to always be perfect and showing your literal toddler that you don't side with your husband whenever the kid does something out of line will bite you and your child in the back. \n\nYour husband snapped, he apologised to your kid, but because of your petty behaviour he wasn't able to show your kid that just because daddy got angry he still loves him the same and still wants to spend time with him and still wants to cuddle, hug, put him to bed.\n\nYou're not doing your child any favours by being this unforgiving for any little mistake your husband makes and showing your child that you and his other parent aren't on the same side and aren't supporting each other over even just little things and ultimately you're teaching your child that you don't trust your husband's parenting and that your kid doesn't have to take dad seriously because you don't, either. \n\nAgain, of course you shouldn't shout at your child. Of course you shouldn't snap at your kid. But even the best parent in the world doesn't do anything perfectly, and you're damaging your kids relationship to his dad by showing him actively that you don't trust dad's decisions, don't support dad in how he raises his son, and ultimately walk over him when he disciplines your kid.\n\nAlso, toddlers cry. My toddler cried the other day because I didn't let him play with the toaster. Would you have thrown a fit and not let me take care of my kid anymore cause I made him cry by not letting him stick the fork in the toaster, too?", "NTA - as a mother of 4 and grandmother of 6, there are several troubling things I see here.  Hubby and sis should not be having serious discussions with a 2 year old running around.  I\u2019m surprised they couldn\u2019t wait 15 minutes for OP to come out of the shower to have their discussion.  Secondly, two year olds are loud and lack impulse control.  Instead of yelling at him repeatedly, redirect his energy.  Get him a toy to play with, a book to \u201cread\u201d or even a TV show to watch if the conversation couldn\u2019t wait for 15 minutes.  Thirdly, OP\u2019s sister needs to sort her self out without interfering with OP\u2019s household.  \n\nIf dad never yells at the two year old, that was probably scary for him.  Sis needs to check herself and understand that she\u2019s not the center of attention all the time and sometimes a two year old needs attention. \n\nFor all you who are saying that the two year old needs \u201cboundaries\u201d, yelling is not the way to accomplish that.  Redirection is a much better, kinder way to handle it.", "Yeah you are being way overprotective and treating your husband like he doesn\u2019t have an equal say in parenting. You invalidated him as a dad. Also your sister snapped at an understandably rowdy 2yearold. Hardly a crime worthy of being kicked out. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYour SIL and your husband were discussing serious and stressful matters.  They lost their tempers.  Now, while I'm sure you n e v e r have lost your temper it does happen--even to the best parent.  \n\nYou way over reacted.", "I feel like there's more to the story in your husband's side. If that behavior is way out of him norm, I'd guess something pushed him to it. And I'd would want to know why. Was the discussion tense? Did he feel pressured by sister to calm your son? If that's the case, she needs to understand that your son doing his thing is part of coming over and she needs to deal with it or not come over.", "I feel like most people commenting here haven't been around many 2 year olds. \n\n2 year olds don't follow instructions well. Just as a general rule. Parents should not be surprised by this. \n\nIf dad needed quiet, then he sets up the guiderails to help his 2 year old succeed. You need quiet? Get out the play doh, or the blocks, or the (fill in quiet time activity here). You don't scream at them to be quiet because **shockingly** they're fucking 2 and they have the memory to match. \n\nParenting means setting your children up as best as possible to meet age appropriate expectations. It is not age appropriate to expect shouting at a 2 year old will make them consider what quiet activities they should do instead. \n\nNta", "Yea, YTA. Aunts should be able to discipline their nieces/nephews, was your son just being his normal self, yes, was he in the wrong, no. But when a child is asked to do something then they need to do what they are being asked (assuming it's reasonable), the same as if you boss, or your parents asked you to do something. Was your husband wrong to raise his voice, probably, but your son was already asked twice to settle down for a while.", "YTA,\n\nSnapping at a two-year-old for behaving like a two-year-old was developmentally inappropriate and doesn't have the desired effect, and your husband knew it as soon as he did it.
