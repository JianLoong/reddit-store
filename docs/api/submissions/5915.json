It's not unusual for friend groups in their 20s to slowly fall apart because of this.\n\nWhile the mature folks (like you) are having long term relationships with people who are mature themselves (like your boyfriend), looking for a healthy relationship that could lead to a happy marriage, others...\n\nWell, they are dating someone just because they have been before, or nice dates, or in Katy's case someone who can give them a lot of attention.\n\nI don't want to judge too much here, because it's fine to not be ready for a real, long term commitment, and also if her boyfriend is on board, they are indeed happy as a couple. They just have different needs, and their needs are met by their partner.\n\nFrom that standpoint she did nothing wrong. She wanted to genuinely help you with her limited point of view. She isn't able to see how your relationship and her relationship differ.\n\nShe might be able to do so in a couple of years.\n\nHonestly I think you got a bit too sensitive by her butting in. She meant well. You know she has a limited point of view. You could've taken her advice as what it is:\nReal concern for you.\n\nAnd she isn't wrong, when someone is busy with other stuff in a relationship, and the connection suffers, making time for your partner is what really helps. Maybe planning date night, something like that.\n\nYou didn't need to cut her off that rude.\n\nI am going for NAH.\n\nYou're both young, and you're navigating adulthood together as friends. Asymmetry happens. Take it as an opportunity to grow instead of lashing out.\n\nIt sounds like you had some choice words for her boyfriend and took an opportunity to dish them out there - and that wasn't as mature/nice as you want to be seen.", "**ESH**\n\nI don\u2019t believe you meant to hurt her but it\u2019s clear you did, and that\u2019s kinda the point\n\nShe\u2019s obviously an asshole, no questions there\n\nI\u2019d alter my judgement to N T A if you called her and said something like \u201cI\u2019m sorry I said what I said, but I don\u2019t need you making those kinds of commentary on my situation either - deal?\u201d\n\nIf she throws it back in your face, then she\u2019s still an asshole and you ain\u2019t\n\nIf she accepts it and tries to be better, then you took the high ground and still ain\u2019t an asshole\n\nI think it all depends on how you handle yourself next", "NAH\n\nSeeing as this is one of the minority judgements on this post, I\u2019ll explain what I think. From her perspective, her relationship is perfect and she\u2019s happy, whereas you\u2019re not satisfied and came to her for advice. She\u2019s just telling you what she thinks about the situation, it\u2019s her opinion. If you don\u2019t want to hear her opinion, why\u2019d you ask her for advice in the first place? Why didn\u2019t you tell her to stop instead of simply ignoring her? It\u2019s not like her advice was unsolicited because YOU asked for it. \n\nI\u2019ve been the friend that has to give advice and sometimes it comes from a place of tough love. All that she knows about him is coming from you, so when you constantly complain about him, she thinks something\u2019s wrong. I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re a complete ass since you were clearly upset by it, but I still think you should have told her or established boundaries instead of ignoring it and then insulting her.
