It's not unusual for friend groups in their 20s to slowly fall apart because of this.\n\nWhile the mature folks (like you) are having long term relationships with people who are mature themselves (like your boyfriend), looking for a healthy relationship that could lead to a happy marriage, others...\n\nWell, they are dating someone just because they have been before, or nice dates, or in Katy's case someone who can give them a lot of attention.\n\nI don't want to judge too much here, because it's fine to not be ready for a real, long term commitment, and also if her boyfriend is on board, they are indeed happy as a couple. They just have different needs, and their needs are met by their partner.\n\nFrom that standpoint she did nothing wrong. She wanted to genuinely help you with her limited point of view. She isn't able to see how your relationship and her relationship differ.\n\nShe might be able to do so in a couple of years.\n\nHonestly I think you got a bit too sensitive by her butting in. She meant well. You know she has a limited point of view. You could've taken her advice as what it is:\nReal concern for you.\n\nAnd she isn't wrong, when someone is busy with other stuff in a relationship, and the connection suffers, making time for your partner is what really helps. Maybe planning date night, something like that.\n\nYou didn't need to cut her off that rude.\n\nI am going for NAH.\n\nYou're both young, and you're navigating adulthood together as friends.

And it sounds like you don\u2019t really value Katy\u2019s opinion at all. So I failed to see the point in going to her for advice to begin with.\n\nYou also say you refuse to disclose important details to protect your boyfriend\u2019s privacy. So if you\u2019re refusing to give specific details, it\u2019s hard for anyone to actually give you useful advice to your specific situation. It\u2019s like someone saying I\u2019m having trouble with losing weight, but then refusing to go into their dietary and exercise habits. But they don\u2019t like the advice of people just saying exercise when they refuse to give details. \n\nIt also sounds like you didn\u2019t want advice to begin with. Sounds like you wanted to let a load off. And that\u2019s fine if you want to let a load off but you need to be clear that that\u2019s what you want. It sounds like that\u2019s not even clear to yourself and it wasn\u2019t clear to yourself that that was what you were doing.\n\nIn  Katy\u2019s opinion she sees your boyfriend as a bad boyfriend. You say you want more time with him. You make it clear that you have relayed to him that you need and want more quality time with him. He doesn\u2019t give you more time. You already know his schedule is busy and as you pointed out to her, he works two jobs and goes to university. Everything you\u2019ve done here sounds practically illogical to me to be honest. \n\nYour boyfriend is unable to give you time because he\u2019s busy. And you\u2019re complaining about it. Katy solution is find someone who will give you what you need and want. If you don\u2019t like that solution, then maybe stop asking for answers where there are no answers. Your boyfriend can\u2019t give up his two jobs and it\u2019s obviously not going to leave university just to spend more time with you. \n\nYou say you frame it as what can you do as a better partner, but there really is nothing you can do as a better partner. It\u2019s not your schedule that\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s his schedule that\u2019s the problem. The only thing you can do is stop complaining about not getting time with him. The only thing you can do is stop complaining about him distancing from you. Anything you can do is stop arguing with him about this and that, which you clearly state in your post that you are doing. Beyond leaving him, those are the only things within your control. If you don\u2019t like, and that\u2019s what Katy sees then stop going to her for advice. Because everything that you say to be the problem in your relationship is rooted in your boyfriend\u2019s limited time he has available.\n\nAnd then you go for the jugular and insult her boyfriend. She probably recognizes what the world sees him as because what he\u2019s doing right now is not the most prescriptive thing a young man, or any young person in the life should be doing, a.k.a. living off their parents, and not trying to achieve any form of Autonomous living. I can either be through education at a technical school or university, or just finding a job. You don\u2019t have to remind her of that. And she\u2019s not the one who want to you to bitch about her boyfriend. You went to her. And it sounds like how she frames all her comments are \u201cthis is how I see it because his how me and my boyfriend do it\u201d and you just didn\u2019t like hearing that. And you most likely don\u2019t like hearing that because you\u2019re in a rocky situation with your own boyfriend and you don\u2019t like beings reminded of feeling that she\u2019s happy and you\u2019re not.\n\nYTA", "NTA - and as for your other two friends - sorry you can\u2019t apologize for being right,  \u2018that\u2019s just how you are\u2019.

I agree she shouldn't have gone to the friend as she knew what she'd do, but I've also had friends that always say that.
