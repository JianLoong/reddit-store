In my early 30s now and about to have our first kid, I decided it\u2019s time to stop unnecessary spending put enough money aside for 3 kids. My friend got pissed at me for refusing to chip in for HIS gf\u2019s birthday gift and party that I\u2019m not even attending! He called me a greedy snob, called my wife a gold digger and the rest of my friends ghosted me as well.\n\nDeets for anyone who cares:\n\nI\u2019ve fortunately been financially supported by my parents. E.g. Private school, first car, college, deposit for house, investment loan. \n\nI\u2019ve had the same group of 6 friends since kindergarten. They are mostly from wealthy families, so our lifestyles have been similar. The only difference is I decided to go to college and all of them went straight to their family businesses. \n\nAll throughout high-school and while I was in college, we would throw parties, go to expensive dinners, clubbing and spend equally I would say. College is where I started sticking out, I met my now wife and it got serious quick. She was NOT a fan of my friends from the get go or our lifestyle.\n\nShe would much rather go to Mcds than a steakhouse and she would always insist on paying her share on dates. My friends liked to hang out with her cause she was a bit tomboyish but their gfs (or whoever they were dating) did not. \n\nRight after I landed a well paid job and got into investing, I proposed, paid of my wife\u2019s debt, secured a house/mortgage (which she also contributes to). Then we got married 4 years later and planning for our first baby. \n\nI wanted our future kids to have the same opportunities I did, so i put a good sum of money aside in a trust to cover 3 kids, their first cars, house/apartment deposit, school and college, wedding. This accounted for inflation so it was a huge amount.\n\nWith our combined income and my investments we will still live a comfortable but much less lavish life.\n\nMy friends started noticing we\u2019re flaking a lot but I\u2019ve honestly outgrown that lifestyle. I need to focus on my family, job and shit I like to sleep in on weekends without a hangover.\n\nOne of my friends (Jack) flipped, called me a snob, said his gf was right my wife got me whipped, shes just gold digger, turning me against them, im forgetting my roots.\n\n**Edit: more info on what triggered the reaction): they wanted to go clubbing for Jack\u2019s gf\u2019s birthday. They also wanted to chip in for a big present. I haven\u2019t known this girl for long and wasn\u2019t really up for it, so said Ill pass. Jack asked how much I\u2019m chipping in, so I said it doesn\u2019t make sense to chip in to an outing im not coming to AND a present for HIS girl? (I\u2019ve never asked them to chip in for my wife\u2019s present but we do chip in when were buying one of the guys something).**\n\nJack is a classic dickhead. I\u2019ve invested a lot in his multiple failed businesses. His dad dropped him too cause he wasn\u2019t pulling his weight and lost their company loads of money..\n\nBut all the others sided with him, wtf? They\u2019re literally the only close friends I\u2019ve known for over 25 years and I thought we\u2019d have our kids grow up together. But they just stopped talking to me for two months now\n\nEdit: added update on the triggering event but all in all thank you guys for support\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "created_utc": 1667075400, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ygtw0x/aita_for_not_chipping_insupporting_my_friends_now/", "score": 158, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friends can't accept that and that's their problem,  not yours.", "Wow, you're NTA, but your friends are a different story. You and your wife seem like truly well adjusted people with feet firmly on the ground with good family values. Your only problem is that you need new friends.

Yikes, think about it, you really don't need them sucking you down into the mire.", "NTA. These people are not your friends, they are on your payroll.

Fyi, throughout this entire post, you never described a friend.   You described users.   Stick with your wife and your family.

If there are some real friends in the bunch, they will come round to your way of thinking. If not, well you were only their ATM anyway, so good riddance! Good luck with the baby and everything!", "NTA. Sometimes you simply\nOutgrow friends because you at different life stages. Honsetly they all sound like teenagers still.

You are way too nice, first of all. Who tf pays for their friend\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s present?!?! I\u2019m sorry your friends suck OP, especially the other friends who dropped you just like that.

I think you emotionally outgrew your friend group a long time ago and this was the tantrum extinction event where they get the last word to hurt you bc the gravy train has finally ended.  I imagine their thought at first was to punish you until things go back to how they were but really all they did was end a one way relationship where they\u2019ve been taking advantage of you for at least 10 if not 15+ years.  \n\nYour friend jack did a lot of projecting.  He was basically calling himself out bc your SO seems like nothing how he described her but if you think about it what he said it describes how he\u2019s treated you.  Like taking your money and wasting it many times over instead of finding a career and making it work or even just working on himself and improving his emotional intelligence so he can be successful.  \n\nHonestly sounds like they did you a great favor by ditching you over your new priorities.  They were not your friends.  Maybe at one point they were but not for a long time.  Congrats on expanding your family and trust me you will soon be too busy to pay them much mind anyway.", "NTA", "You grew up and your wife showed you a life you never knew you wanted.

You don't make people pay for events they aren't participating in and esp for ppl they barely know.  And this isn't even his wife or a milestone occasion. Just some random girlfriend?\n\nAnd if his family is so loaded, why do guys friends need to chip in for a gift for his girl?\n\nI would never ask even my closest friends to chip in for a lavish gift for my spouse unless that was a tradition among ourselves.  If they choose to get him a birthday gift on their own, great, but not expected.", "NTA you have reached a new stage in your life and decided to get mature with money and not keep the rich kid of insta gram life style going.  These \"friends\" are not your friends and they probably haven't been to behin with.  It's gonna hurt but they will drag you down and cut into your marriage.", "There is nothing wrong with living as you wish, there is a lot of wrong with being mooch and asshole.", "I get that, I just mentioned it to show what triggered and how much history we had together. Around 25 years of friendship and brotherhood thrown out so quickly", "That\u2019s what sucks honestly, that all of them are ready to throw it all away just to hold on to their youth.\n\nI figured I would lose touch at some point but not all at once. 3 of the others are genuinely good people and have slowly been getting serious about settling down. So those ones hurt the most", "Your first sentence is wisdom. You have a perspective that many do not have.", "I started making my own money a lot quicker and it kept growing. Working during college, personal investments and then landed a job in IT. \n\nThey are still bankrolled and paid salaries from the family business, they definitely still have money but not the kind they were used to. So a lot of them (especially Jack) are banking on inheritance so they can go back to having that carefree money.", "1 more than me buddy!", "I understand. I can imagine some of them will come around eventually. They can\u2019t all be so spoilt if you\u2019re friends with them. You seem like a good dude.", "I think they were your friends, but you've grown apart to have different priorities. I think this scares them, so they would rather turn their backs on you than deal with seeing you settle into a different life than they are currently living - maybe because it makes them feel stressed and left behind, maybe because they genuinely aren't mature enough to see that fun can be had many different ways.\n\nThey definitely were your friends when your lives intersected, and it's possible some will become your friends again when their lives bring them closer to you again.\n\nBut I think this group may have run it's course. Try focusing on the individuals you actually like and see if you can grow friendships with them personally instead of as a group. Invite some of them to take part in your family life, to let them see why you don't want to mess around as much. Talk about how excited you are to be a dad, ask them how they would want to raise a child, what was the most important lesson they learned from an adult when they were young etc. Invite them to think about what you think about, and maybe they'll see why you prioritise the things you do. And ask questions and be supportive of their life choices even if they still prefer to party every weekend - that's valid too! But judging you for not wanting the same isn't cool.\n\nNTA.", "You know what? I think the difference between you and them is not how you spend your money. It\u2019s education. You\u2019re the only one who went to college. They stayed in high school.", "I know it sucks. What helped me through these changes is to remind myself people change and friends show up (or don't) based on their ability which may or may not meet my needs. Ex. One friend can and will drop everything on a dime if I'm in a serious jam....another friend cannot. The difference is life structure, finances, their support system, obligations and their perception. Hope this helps. The changes you see now that may distance you from some could change in 8 to 10 years.", "Ok. Ya I would stop. They're trying to party and live on money they don't have. U can't pay for them forever. What happens if their inheritance isn't what they thought or they also waste that money away? Ur friends already started their lives so privileged and instead of using that to their advantaged to learn and do more, they took a comp. So yes, in fact u r right, they aren't rich, they're kids with rich parents. Either they work harder and smarter to earn more or they need to learn to adjust their lifestyle. U r NOT their personal free bank. It is NOT ur responsibility to pay for their fun time. The fact that they think they are more important than ur family.... then ur kids speaks volume to me. It's all good when the money is coming and drinks r flowing, but once responsibility hits they wanna complain?", "Thank you dude, needed to hear that. If they do, they do. I\u2019ll just to find peace in whatever I guess", "Nicely put"]}
