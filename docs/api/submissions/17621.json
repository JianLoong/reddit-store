My fianc\u00e9e then asked me \u201cwhy do you look miserable now?\u201d To which I just told her \u201cI\u2019m not miserable, but I\u2019m thinking about the trip\u201d and I walked out of the room and downstairs. \n\nI think what\u2019s bothering me, is that if roles were reversed, I feel like she would be upset and ask me to cancel the trip. And then on top of that, she would be upset at me for not realizing it was Mother\u2019s Day. Lastly, knowing that it\u2019s barely my second Father\u2019s Day, I think I\u2019d rather spend the day with our son. \n\nIn her defense, I did agree to the trip way back when, and it is her friends bachelorette-bachelor party. \n\nAITA for wanting to stay home with my family to celebrate Father\u2019s Day?", "created_utc": 1684466555, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ljloe/aita_for_wanting_a_fathers_day_that_i_want/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like, you just said you weren't miserable, you were just thinking about the trip and nothing more? Because, honestly, I don't know the exact date of Father's Day either- as it changes every year, it isn't a stand out date. She may have known it was sometime next month, but didn't know it would land in the middle of this trip. And if you had already agreed to go, she may still think you're ok with it, regardless.

Your feelings are valid, particularly as you put effort into knowing when Mother\u2019s Day was and planning it for her, but now you need to think about how to approach this with her so it doesn\u2019t fester and build resentments.

What you would like to happen now: do you want her to cancel or would you be ok with an alternate date which is focused on celebrating you as a father?\n\nClarifying these points in yourself before talking to her might help you stay calm and on point during the talk.", "YTA.\n\nYou agreed to it without even checking the dates but that's not why I'm judging you the asshole.\n\nYou didn't even talk to her. You looked obviously upset and YOU DIDN'T EVEN TALK TO HER.\n\nThis annoys me so much in these posts. \n\nWhy not just discuss your issue ? Why come running to Reddit before you even have an argument where you could potentially be an asshole ? \n\nShe said to her friend she'd check with you.

Your son is clearly young. He\u2019s not going to have any idea what day is Father\u2019s Day.

There is nothing stopping you from celebrating those relationships in any other day of the year.\n\nJust celebrate the weekend before or after and be flexible.\n\nWhat if your childs birthdate coincided with valentine's Day every few years?
