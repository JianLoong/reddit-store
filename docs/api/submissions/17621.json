It sounds like you're bringing up a random gripe, if not. \n\nTalk to her about the situation. Maybe she had a surprise in store that can be rescheduled for a different day. Maybe she didn't realize you'd feel strongly about this. If you're thinking \"well she SHOULD realize\" - okay then talk to her!! It sounds like 99% of this is in your head and never spoken.\n\nIt's okay to be upset. But you need to face this like an adult and talk about it.

OP wants to spend time with his kid. The beauty of being a parent is that you can celebrate Father's Day and Mother's Day anytime you want. Don't let some commercialization of the day force you to celebrate just one day a year. Spouse works weekends, so we rarely celebrate Mother's Day and Father's Day on the designated day.", "NAH. Talk this out. But what I\u2019ve come to terms with, with my partner is that sometimes things come up and events need to be moved around. He had a business trip during an anniversary. That\u2019s cool, we bumped it to the day after he got back. Etc. Spending the time together is more important than the actual day.", "By the sound of it its not too late to adjust the dates as you mentioned that she hadn't yet put money down on the air bnb and her friends asked her about it meaning they understood it might be an issue. \n\nSo you are only the asshole if you sit and fester on your feelings without communicating in a timely manner so that either a compromise or change can be made.", "ESH\n\nYou and your SO really need to work on your communication skills!", "It\u2019s funny to see how understanding people are about Fathers Day.  Especially with all the Mother\u2019s Day posts from earlier this week when people were calling for divorces if you didn\u2019t get every mother you have ever encountered a good gift.

You can\u2019t expect her to know how strongly you feel, especially to something you have already agreed to, without communicating. \n\nThis would change to ESH if neither of you can compromise a little to accommodate both of these events.  You had a kid together.   \n\nThere are going to be lots of times when you will need to give your partner some grace before getting huffy and communicate to solve problems together.

It makes sense for him to still want a designated special day considering he\u2019s a new dad and put effort into Mother\u2019s Day. Being a parent is hard, he probably deserves it! But being completely inflexible about the specific date is a bit silly considering it\u2019s not a birthday, federal holiday or once in a lifetime event (like the wedding weekend).\n\nI think it\u2019s also forgivable that fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t know it fell on Father\u2019s Day considering she\u2019s a new mom and Father\u2019s Day falls on a different date each year.\n\nHe agreed to the trip (without asking dates) and therefore it makes sense for fianc\u00e9 to chat about the trip with her friends. When she realized it was Father\u2019s Day she told them she\u2019d first check with OP. \n\nOP, YTA for seemingly expecting fianc\u00e9 to cancel a one time wedding-related trip (which you agreed to) that\u2019s been planned in advance simply because it falls on Father\u2019s Day. And for leaving the room in a huff (instead of communicating) when your fianc\u00e9 noticed a change in your demeanor and asked what was wrong. \n\nA little flexibility and communication will go a long way. Best case scenario you get to enjoy a a weekend getaway AND a special extra day that\u2019s specifically dedicated to you being a dad.", "Yep! We celebrate when we can get together with everyone's work schedules. The day doesn't matter as much as celebrating who/whatever holiday stress free with the people we care about. We celebrate Thanksgiving on Saturday so we don't have to stress mid week and no one has to rush off to someone else's house. \n\nOP YTA for agreeing without checking the days yourself as well as assuming she would be mad if roles were reversed without even talking to her about it. This is a rare event that can't be celebrated another day. Have a good trip and plan another day to celebrate father's day and communicate to her how important it is to you to still celebrate it.", "I was thinking this.

He might be somewhere around 2 ywars old, too, although that seems less likely.", "For real she was reminded it was going to be Father's day and told to check and instead of checking sent the money.

My husband and I have agreed that holidays such as Valentine\u2019s Day, Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day should absolutely be celebrated, but they don\u2019t necessarily need to be celebrated on the designated day. It\u2019s usually much more convenient and cheaper to decide a different day within a two-week time frame of the calendar date designated for the holiday.\n\nThis year for Mother\u2019s Day, my husband had just started a new job and was uncomfortable asking for time off so early. Instead of celebrating on the 14th, we celebrated the following Wednesday when he had the day off.\n\nThat works for us because we communicate about it. OP and his wife need to actually have a convo about this. If I were OP\u2019s wife, I would probably assume my husband would be ok with celebrating a different day because this event for my friend is once in a lifetime. However, I would still have that convo with him. OP\u2019s feelings are valid because he feels like he won\u2019t get a celebration at all. If OP and wife have a convo about it, there should be a relatively simple resolution to this.\n\nTL;DR, yes, as a mom I absolutely would be ok with my husband celebrating this once in a lifetime event for his close friend and scheduling a different day to celebrate Mother\u2019s Day, as long as I was aware that we were still going to celebrate Mother\u2019s Day at some point.
