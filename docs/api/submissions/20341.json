I won't be able to fit everything in my post. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 has always been anxious around dogs. Bigger dogs mainly. She has good reason behind this. On top of her anxiety surrounding dogs, she simply does not like them. This is trauma based (she miscarried when she was with her ex due to his dog and he took the dogs side and kicked her out after blaming her for it). Because of this, she truly feels like dogs are useless and break up families. She simply hates dogs. She has recently put herself in therapy. \n\nWell, back 7ish months ago my mom needed me to watch her dog because she was going in for surgery. Small breed dog. My fianc\u00e9 isn't afraid of the dog or anything and at first seemed to warm up to her. But.. my mom's surgery had complications. She is now in a wheelchair permanently and she can no longer care for the dog. She begged me to take the dog in permanently so she could still see \"her baby\". My mom asked in front of my fianc\u00e9 and my fianc\u00e9 hated confrontation due to her past trauma and didn't say no. She said \"okay\" and left it at that. Since that point, she refuses to acknowledge the dogs existence. She has openly showed disgust whenever I cuddle the dog. She has made comments about not wanting the nasty animal near her. She's not neglectful of the dog by any means but she hates her existence and that much is obvious; which sucks because the dog loves her. \n\nWell, she took a pregnancy test 3 weeks ago and it came back positive. She is panicking about everything now. One big thing being the dog. She won't go near the dog at all. She doesn't want the dog in our room or on the furniture or within sniffing distance of her, basically. I'm assuming due to the fact that she miscarried due to her exs dog. She came to me crying yesterday and said \"I'm sorry but I have a choice to make here because I won't stay in this house pregnant with a dog and I won't have the dog around a baby either.\" I told her everything would be fine. I'm not her ex. This dog isn't her exs dog. She said I \"don't understand\" and that either she has to leave or the dog does. I told her rehoming the dog wasn't an option and begged for another alternative. She said there was no other alternative and she left. She left her FB open and has discussed abortion or adoption with her friend because she \"can't do this alone\". I've begged her to come home and she said \"when the dogs gone we will talk\". But I can't. It's my mom's dog.\n\nETA: I can't afford to pay for boarding for the dog and neither can my mom. If I was to get rid of the dog it would destroy my mother. It was my dad's dog, who died last year. She feels like this dog is her last connection to my father. It would mentally destroy her. My fianc\u00e9 is NOT manipulating me. I knew she didn't want the dog here and I knew she had trauma surrounding dogs but I made the choice to keep the dog here. Jesus Christ. She's making a choice that fits her needs and that's perfectly okay. People that say it's manipulative that she's putting herself first are wild and giving narcissistic vibes.", "created_utc": 1687463100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14gcwtl/aita_for_saying_rehoming_my_dog_isnt_an_option/", "score": 229, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have grown up my whole life with dogs. With my current dog, there is virtually nothing that would make me give her up, as she is family. I get the concerns from some commenters here, but I think some of them have likely never owned a dog and so can't actually relate in any way.\n\nThat being said, I put my family first. We had to give away our 4 year old dog when I was younger because she bit my younger brother on his face. It was an awful decision to come to, especially since she wasn't aggressive but wmy brother got past her gate and started being a kid (2) and she reacted defensively. It was definitely an accident, but my parents still didn't want to take a chance again, nor did I. We rehomed her with a friend and it wrecked us. She was happy though and was treated like absolute royalty (DINK house).\n\nYour wife has very valid reasons for fearing dogs.

This is a red flag. Has your mom trained the dog at all? I find small dogs don't get trained usually as people just write off their behaviour. A Chihuahua needs to be trained just as much as Pitbull does, no excuses. If not, you need decide if you are willing to put the time, energy and money into training this dog extremely thoroughly so the point there's no concerns of it even raising a lip to you, your wife or your child.\n\nIt's a tough situation, but I think rehoming is best for everyone. It's not the dogs fault that your wife had such a traumatic experience, it's not your mom's fault she got sick (I'm very sorry to hear this, I hope she continues to recover well), and it's not your wife's fault she has developed a phobia of dogs.

He says he wants to have the baby. \n\nThis dog is also untrained, reactive, and destructive (to the point that the fiance has to take it to the dog park 3-4 times a day in order to burn off energy to not destroy their house).", "Baby>Dog\n\nBaby>Mom too.\n\nNot because mom is unimportant. But because his obligation to his child is stronger AND his mom won't be hurt as much by rehoming the dog for her grandchild's sake as the child will be hurt by having its mother traumatized while it is in utero OR from having its biological parents split up over this", "He\u2019s not prioritizing a dog just over a romantic partner but ALSO over his own unborn child. If he wants to be a parent (and nowhere does he say he doesn\u2019t) then that is inexcusable. I LOVE my dog and he is my first baby, but when my hubby and I got pregnant, the nicest thing that a friend said to me was \u201cif you\u2019re dog is unhappy once baby comes or is a danger to your child, he has a home with me\u201d (this friend would dog sit for us). Luckily my dog is incredible with children and naturally very patient, and we\u2019ve never had issues. But this isn\u2019t always the case.", "Marriage vows say otherwise, and they\u2019re engaged.", "OPs comment about what happened with the other dog: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14gcwtl/comment/jp4wiwn/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14gcwtl/comment/jp4wiwn/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)", "He mentioned what happend ans she was indeed attacked very badly. She needed stitches and the blood loss and stress from the attack made her miscarry.", "As a former dog walker/sitter please know that my small dogs were way more vicious than the large ones. The two instances I was \u201cattacked\u201d by large dogs was when I was a kid and didn\u2019t know the \u201cgame\u201d the neighbor kids played with it on their bikes and got bit as a result. The little dogs would be just straight up mean. \n\nThe dog growling at kids is a huge piece of missing information. It also doesn\u2019t sound like *you* are attached to the dog. So this is one of the rare instances I\u2019d say YTA and should rehome the dog (coming from someone who literally has 10 fur children instead of having human children)", "Right? It\u2019s the worst take I\u2019ve ever seen on here!", "Honesty it's probably for the best she gets the abortion and leaves him, he would make a shit father.", "Still the wrong choice. \n\nObligation to child is stronger. AND while his mom wants the dog taken care of, rehoming it for the sake of her grandchild won't seriously damage mom's relationship with OP. And if it does, Mom would be toxic.", "Your mom is also an AH by the sounds of it. That\u2019s her unborn grandchild your fianc\u00e9 is carrying and she\u2019s more worried about a dog? That\u2019s incredibly insensitive.", "Your mom is a narcissistic monster.", "See if you can find a foster-only rescue; they (as the name implies) only place dogs into foster homes, because they don't maintain shelters.", "Sounds like you\u2019re going to have to be a big boy and make the hard choice to give it a loving home with another family \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "<<(to the point that the fiance has to take it to the dog park 3-4 times a day in order to burn off energy to not destroy their house).>>\n\nSo OP has made Fianc\u00e9e responsible for this dog that she associates with her trauma--going with OP is the AH for that alone.  Choosing Dog over future wife/baby also makes OP AH in this case(still seeking mommy's approval).  Perhaps OP needs to seek some therapy.", "They WOULD split over this, a fact she has made clear. OP accepted her as his partner knowing that she was not willing to have a dog in her household. This is not even his dog, and his only reason he wants to keep it is so that his Mom can see it. He is putting his Mom visiting her dog over both his relationship and his ability to be in the household with his child. Those are some messed up priorities.", "I just saw, that is brutal. Poor woman, I wish OO had made that clear from the beginning.", "180 stitches and enough blood loss to cause a miscarriage. It was a mauling. Which led to her losing her baby, followed by her home and her relationship after her ex blamed her and threw her out.", "One of my friends has a Pom that HATES children. He's old and mostly blind but if he detects a child he's just foaming at the mouth, desperate for blood. IIRC, a child pulled his fur years ago and he never got over it. \n\nI'm a cat person myself, but I even had to rehome a cat because he would not stop violently attacking my other cats. Now he's living his absolute best life as an only pet (I have his new mom on social media) instead of getting perpetual time-out for violence. Sometimes rehoming is the right thing and you have to get past the guilt of what could be, face what is, and do what's best for everyone.", "I mean, yes CHILDREN need to learn this (I\u2019m a parent and a dog owner and this is very impotent to teach). But a baby? Babies can\u2019t learn that. And some dogs just hate babies because of the sounds they make and how they move their limbs.", "But you think it\u2019s okay that your abandoning your fianc\u00e9 over this? What\u2019s wrong with you?", "Do yourself a favor and disappoint her! She sounds like a narcissist, and you\u2019re picking that over your fianc\u00e9? Nah my dude. I understand it\u2019s a lose/lose situation, but losing your fianc\u00e9 is gonna be way worse than losing a narcissistic mother.", "Blowing up your relationship with you child won\u2019t make your mum love you. All it does is teach your kid to feel the same way that she made you feel. This is actually about your trauma from your emotionally neglectful mother. Winning her approval won\u2019t mean as much as you think it\u2019s going to if it costs your everything else. I mean she is happy for you to be an absent father if it means she doesn\u2019t have to look after her own dog. Does that seem like love to you? She didn\u2019t get better after your dad died. She just realized that unless she plays nice then she won\u2019t be able to control you.", "So why are you trying to please your toxic mum and put her above the mother of your child?\n\nSounds like you need some kind of therapy dude your brain is cooked", "It sounds like you\u2019re answering your own question. You know what the right choice is, it\u2019s time to take action.", "You have to decide if you would rather disappoint your mother or ruin your relationship", "I cannot believe you -- YOU are putting her in this position. Don't fool yourself into believing you're giving her a choice!! JFC, dude, what the hell is going on with you? This is the woman you supposedly love -- and you're putting her through this? How can you say you love her if YOU are putting her in this situation?\n\nThe trauma she endured is way too much and the dog has growled at children. I absolutely love animals and I know what it's like to lose someone you love -- but in your mother's situation, if I knew your fianc\u00e9's full story, I would be asking you to find a home for the dog and to contact rescue organizations. Someone will take this dog and give it a good home. I understand your mom's pain, but it's gone over into selfishness and you're allowing your mom to control you and your life.\n\nIt's heartbreaking that you would do this to the woman your profess to love and your unborn child.", "So don't put the baby near the dog or the dog near the baby. \n\nThe fact that y'all seem so willing to leave your infants unattended baffles me.", "Maybe if you got mauled by a dog you would be more sympathetic \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11TWICE\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d", "Holy shit!?!?!", "Again, not liking anyone and being aggressive are not the same thing. Has the dog ever attacked anyone? If not, this isn't a big deal.\n\nAlso, the 180 stitches but *probably* should be in the main post. As well as details of the dog's temperament. \n\nInstead we get what sounds like a massive overreaction from a manipulative wife, and a candy coating of the dog's temperament. OP is a shit storyteller. \n\nI stand by what I said though, growls do not always equal aggression and more often than not are not indeed aggression.", "If that's your take give up the dog...... what more needs saying?\n\nI would never give up my dogs for anything or anyone. How exactly did the dog make her lose a baby? Did it push her down the stairs?", "Well, how do you think your dad would feel if you got rid of *your* baby, your actual human child? Because, by keeping the dog, that's effectively what you'll be doing.\n\nLook, it's obvious that you would benefit from therapy to help you learn to stop prioritizing a woman who has never prioritized you. I hope you get it, and soon, before you irrevocably scupper your chances of creating a healthy, loving family for yourself.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: Who has been kinder and more loving and supportive to you, your fianc\u00e9e or your mother? Based on your comments, it seems abundantly clear that the answer is your fianc\u00e9e. I mean, your mother says \"good riddance\" when you're losing your fianc\u00e9e and unborn child, while your fianc\u00e9e has spent countless hours feeding, grooming, walking, and generally taking care of your mother's dog despite the fact that she is terrified of dogs due to the terrible trauma she endured because of her ex's dog, because it was important to you. Hell, *I'd* choose your fianc\u00e9e over your mother, and I'm a huge dog person (and also a straight woman). So why are you so determined to throw away your fianc\u00e9e and unborn child in order to please your mother? ***Your mother does not care about your happiness*** \u2013 remember that she said \"good riddance\" to the prospect of you losing your fianc\u00e9e and unborn child \u2013 so it is way past time for you to stop prioritizing her happiness over yours and your fianc\u00e9e's.", "I really do feel for you. What your mom is doing to you is beyond messed up. But based on what you\u2019re saying, you will regret making the choice she\u2019s asking you to choose for the rest of your life. I really hope youre able to heal from your moms influence.", "It\u2019s really nation mother saying that but she isn\u2019t taking any responsibility", "Is there ANYONE else who can have the dog?? Sibling? Family friend? Aunt/uncle? Literally anyone? Like maybe you can tell the person you\u2019ll still pay for the dog if they take care of them? I mean your fianc\u00e9 was horrifically attacked by a dog. That\u2019s some serious trauma. I have 8 pets and you can see by my username I totally understand the love of pets, but forcing her to essentially relive such an awful event every day in her own home isn\u2019t okay either. Could mom still keep the dog and you could pay like a dog Walker /sitter to help take care of it? Does mom live close or far away? Could you go to her home daily to help take care of it? Also how old is the dog? Are we talking a young dog who has a lot of years left or one that\u2019s closer to the end?"]}
