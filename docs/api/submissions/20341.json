I won't be able to fit everything in my post. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 has always been anxious around dogs. Bigger dogs mainly. She has good reason behind this. On top of her anxiety surrounding dogs, she simply does not like them. This is trauma based (she miscarried when she was with her ex due to his dog and he took the dogs side and kicked her out after blaming her for it). Because of this, she truly feels like dogs are useless and break up families. She simply hates dogs. She has recently put herself in therapy. \n\nWell, back 7ish months ago my mom needed me to watch her dog because she was going in for surgery. Small breed dog. My fianc\u00e9 isn't afraid of the dog or anything and at first seemed to warm up to her. But.. my mom's surgery had complications. She is now in a wheelchair permanently and she can no longer care for the dog. She begged me to take the dog in permanently so she could still see \"her baby\". My mom asked in front of my fianc\u00e9 and my fianc\u00e9 hated confrontation due to her past trauma and didn't say no. She said \"okay\" and left it at that. Since that point, she refuses to acknowledge the dogs existence. She has openly showed disgust whenever I cuddle the dog. She has made comments about not wanting the nasty animal near her. She's not neglectful of the dog by any means but she hates her existence and that much is obvious; which sucks because the dog loves her. \n\nWell, she took a pregnancy test 3 weeks ago and it came back positive. She is panicking about everything now. One big thing being the dog. She won't go near the dog at all. She doesn't want the dog in our room or on the furniture or within sniffing distance of her, basically. I'm assuming due to the fact that she miscarried due to her exs dog. She came to me crying yesterday and said \"I'm sorry but I have a choice to make here because I won't stay in this house pregnant with a dog and I won't have the dog around a baby either.\" I told her everything would be fine. I'm not her ex. This dog isn't her exs dog. She said I \"don't understand\" and that either she has to leave or the dog does. I told her rehoming the dog wasn't an option and begged for another alternative. She said there was no other alternative and she left. She left her FB open and has discussed abortion or adoption with her friend because she \"can't do this alone\". I've begged her to come home and she said \"when the dogs gone we will talk\". But I can't. It's my mom's dog.\n\nETA: I can't afford to pay for boarding for the dog and neither can my mom. If I was to get rid of the dog it would destroy my mother. It was my dad's dog, who died last year. She feels like this dog is her last connection to my father. It would mentally destroy her. My fianc\u00e9 is NOT manipulating me. I knew she didn't want the dog here and I knew she had trauma surrounding dogs but I made the choice to keep the dog here. Jesus Christ. She's making a choice that fits her needs and that's perfectly okay. People that say it's manipulative that she's putting herself first are wild and giving narcissistic vibes.", "created_utc": 1687463100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14gcwtl/aita_for_saying_rehoming_my_dog_isnt_an_option/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This, however, is not currently a healthy relationship if he knew she had insane amounts of trauma around dogs, agreed early on to her boundary of no dogs, and then still brought one into her home. He smashed her reasonable boundary to shreds and she is simply removing herself from the situation for her own mental wellbeing. I don't blame him for wanting to help his mom, but not at the expense of his fiance's mental health. Especially when she is pregnant and undue stress can cause some serious issues with pregnancy. OP absolutely YTA, I'm sure you can find someone nearby (perhaps a friend or another family member) who can take your mom's dog and still allow her frequent visits. This is your fiance and future child and they should come above and beyond anyone and everyone.", "How did a dog cause her miscarriage? How old is the dog? Older dogs have a hard time being rehomed, if you end up taking the dog to a shelter, make sure it is a no kill one.", "I\u2019m so sorry. You are in a terrible situation with no good solution. In your shoes I would choose your wife but I won\u2019t pass judgement.", "Your mom is being completely unreasonable. \n\nShe apparently can't afford to look after the dog herself, and in asking you the big favor of looking after it, is now saying you owe her that favor, more than your wife and child matter. \n\nI'm sympathetic to a tough situation, but no matter the excuse you are either placing your mom's happiness and approval over your marriage and future family, or you're not. Unless you already hated your wife and were looking for an excuse to leave, the answer for what to do is clear.", "Do you want to repeat her mistakes? Because that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing now choosing a dog over your own fianc\u00e9 and child. Do you want your kid to look back on this 30 years from now and feel the same way about you as you do about your mom?", "Buddy\u2026 I\u2019m going to try to say this super nicely. I don\u2019t doubt that your fianc\u00e9 has dog related trauma, totally understandable that she would. But the person having an unreasonable response due to trauma is you right now. Are you in therapy at all? Because if you don\u2019t handle this you\u2019ll lose your fianc\u00e9, and your child, and all you\u2019ll be left with is a reactive dog and a narcissist mom.", "You know your mom is full of hot air and bs, right? And you are in need of therapy to recover the toxicity you were raised in. You're STILL fighting to not disappoint your mom, when all she cares about is her dog, that she never cared enough about to train it.", "Give the dog back to your mom.  People in wheelchairs own pets all the time.  Give her the dog back and tell her if she doesn't want to keep it then she needs to find another home for it.  Tell her for once in your life you are choosing to put yourself first and that includes your fiance and child.  If you have to go lc or nc then do that.  Stop letting her be a toxic influence in your life. Go to therapy if you need to", "I agree. But it doesn't sound like GF is even trying. She is making a cruel ultimatum that will harm an innocent animal and OP's disabled mother.", "Attacked, lost a baby, blamed for it and kicked out of the house.\n\nNow a dog enters the stage again, she says she is leaving bc of her trauma and OP's mom says \"good riddance\".\n\nPoor woman.", "This is a small dog. His GF is being selfish and ridiculous. \n\nThe thing OP needs to do is seriously think about lawyering up to get sole custody of the baby. The only reason a dog is breaking up a family is because of her. She is weaponizing her pregnancy to manipulate him. Her behavior is disgusting.", "According to OP, the dog is reactive. Not just against children. It doesn't like others period.", "my very friendly little dog growls at babes in arms because he doesnt understand they're a human and thinks it's a toy  or animal and doesn't get why we don't let him too close (which we can't do because he growls and babies are not experiments lol)", "Okay and so the 6 month old was in zero danger? And the 4 year old was likely being a 4 year old and the dog reacted defensively.", "He attacked her. She ended up needing 180 stitches in her back and her arms. She miscarried due to the stress and blood loss. \n\nMy mom's dog is 4 and doesn't like anyone. Not sure how she would even handle being around others.", "She had to get 180 stitches due to a dog attack and lost her baby. I don\u2019t blame her for her response. She has serious trauma related to dogs and now that she\u2019s pregnant again is not the time to be forcing her to face those fears. OP should not be putting his mom or this dog over his fianc\u00e9 and child. OPs moms comment about good riddance to the fianc\u00e9 over the dog is cruel.", "Wtf? She\u2019s not weaponizing her pregnancy nor is she being manipulative. You seem to have no understanding of what trauma does to a person or how it\u2019s treated, and you\u2019re giving crappy advice as well.", "The selfish person is OP's mom. Other people in wheelchairs are able to have a small dog, why can't she?\n\nOP's fianc\u00e9e is not weaponizing anything, she says \"I don't feel safe here and this dog has shown he will not be safe around my child, I have to leave\"", "A reactive dog isn't a good dog.", "That's so sad. At four, she would probably do okay being rehomed, but she might need a home with someone who is older and retired. I have two rescues who are small dogs, they had some issues when I first adopted them, but they are absolutely wonderful boys now. Is their any way you could put in a dog door for your for your mom, or otherwise make it possible for her to care for the dog?", "So she's traumatized over losing her baby and yet she is thinking about deliberately killing her current baby because she's scared of a little dog? Something is fishy with this whole scenario. If OP's mom dislikes her this much that's a red flag too.", "Can I ask a question? You seem to understand very well why your fianc\u00e9 is responding this way, and even understand without trauma her concerns. Why are you wanting to keep the dog?", "It is though. Animals are reactive. *Everything* is reactive. The dog growling does not equal aggression. \n\nStop defending her? Like, this is a massive overreaction. It's a small breed dog, she can *absolutely* get over it. It can't get to the baby and is likely too small to significantly harm the 4 year old.", "Reactive dogs can be very good dogs if handled properly. My dog doesn't like small children either and can get reactive, but is amazing and kind and gentle with autistic kids 8+.", "He doesn't want to disappoint his mom.", "Jesus, do I really have to explain that dogs jump? Yes, she's a small breed. She's a Heeler mix. She stands just below my knee. She could do damage to a child, absolutely. I truly don't understand why you think that a dog growling at kids is okay because \"that's not aggression\".", "He puts in another comment that she\u2019s toxic, I guess I\u2019m wondering if he\u2019s got his own trigger to disappointing her that\u2019s factoring into this. Could be off base but wondering if that\u2019s part of it.", "I don't understand why you're defending maybes and could bes when you clearly don't think you're at fault to start? \n\nLike, she's absolutely overreacting.\n\nAnd for real, [growling does not mean aggression by default.](https://www.thesprucepets.com/understanding-dog-growling-1118256) Quite the opposite, in fact."]}
