I\u2019m just looking for unbiased opinions. \n\nEssentially my SIL\u2019s youngest, (3yo) is a wild child. Every time we\u2019ve been at a family function, he is unpredictable. And I truly don\u2019t think it\u2019s his fault. He\u2019s 3. It\u2019s that my SIL thinks his behavior is funny and that he\u2019s too young to understand no. \nShe posts on social media all the \u201cbad things\u201d he does and comments about how he\u2019s so funny.  \nSome examples; he ate a bottle of diaper rash creme. He sits on the dining room table surrounded by a bag of flour. He went for a \u201cswim\u201d in the toilet. He had a \u201cperformance\u201d at their church and was the only child on stage running around. Jumping off the stage. ALL of that was posted to Facebook and her recording while laughing and saying she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s gonna do about this kid. \n\nWe have personally witnessed him climbing on glass tables in the grandparents house. Going into someone\u2019s fridge and eating a raw egg. At an event center, running down the hallways, almost made it outside, and pulling out things that should be locked away. Running around a table at a restaurant getting in servers\u2019 ways. And SIL doing nothing about any of it. \n\nShe told us to not come to his 3rd birthday party because at the time our babe was only 4 months old and we made the decision that I would wear her and not pass her around because I knew no one that would be there and didn\u2019t want to risk her getting sick. It was the height of flu season and she was a preemie. She told us to not come because he would want to hold the baby and she said he would not stop crying if we told him no. \n\nI understand all of that is normal 3 year old behavior, and I hate this for him, but it\u2019s the attitude of that it\u2019s hilarious and he can\u2019t be corrected that bothers me. I\u2019m obviously not a fan of her parenting style. She literally has never corrected him ONCE when we\u2019ve been around. \n\nSo this weekend we\u2019re having our girls 1st birthday party. At my best friends house. That is 100% not baby proofed. They have a large dog that is extremely friendly and in your face. There will only be 3 other kids there. They all are older and well behaved. We gently gave her a heads up about all of that, and originally she said that that\u2019s fine and she\u2019ll leave him home with his dad. Then randomly last night she texted my husband and said she had a change of plans and wanted to know if it was okay to bring him. My husband handled it and as kindly as he could told her it wasn\u2019t the best idea. She\u2019s obviously not happy about it. But she said she\u2019d figure something out. \n\nI can admit I 100% just don\u2019t want to deal with it. I want to focus on my girls big day. I want my family and friends to have fun. None of us want to have to keep an eye on a kid that isn\u2019t ours, because my SIL will not. Without a shadow of a doubt, I know she will not pay attention to him. \nBut I know he\u2019s just a small kid and deserves fun too. \n\nSo AITA for asking my SIL to not bring him?

A 3 year old knows right from wrong and can be corrected.   They can be told no, you do not/can\u2019t throw that, and when they do, because that is what they do, then you punish them.  Usually time out works.  Unfortunately, when you put a small child in time out, the parent is punished too, because you have to sit there and watch the kid to be sure they stay in time out.
