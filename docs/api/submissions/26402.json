I\u2019m just looking for unbiased opinions. \n\nEssentially my SIL\u2019s youngest, (3yo) is a wild child. Every time we\u2019ve been at a family function, he is unpredictable. And I truly don\u2019t think it\u2019s his fault. He\u2019s 3. It\u2019s that my SIL thinks his behavior is funny and that he\u2019s too young to understand no. \nShe posts on social media all the \u201cbad things\u201d he does and comments about how he\u2019s so funny.  \nSome examples; he ate a bottle of diaper rash creme. He sits on the dining room table surrounded by a bag of flour. He went for a \u201cswim\u201d in the toilet. He had a \u201cperformance\u201d at their church and was the only child on stage running around. Jumping off the stage. ALL of that was posted to Facebook and her recording while laughing and saying she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s gonna do about this kid. \n\nWe have personally witnessed him climbing on glass tables in the grandparents house. Going into someone\u2019s fridge and eating a raw egg. At an event center, running down the hallways, almost made it outside, and pulling out things that should be locked away. Running around a table at a restaurant getting in servers\u2019 ways. And SIL doing nothing about any of it. \n\nShe told us to not come to his 3rd birthday party because at the time our babe was only 4 months old and we made the decision that I would wear her and not pass her around because I knew no one that would be there and didn\u2019t want to risk her getting sick. It was the height of flu season and she was a preemie. She told us to not come because he would want to hold the baby and she said he would not stop crying if we told him no. \n\nI understand all of that is normal 3 year old behavior, and I hate this for him, but it\u2019s the attitude of that it\u2019s hilarious and he can\u2019t be corrected that bothers me. I\u2019m obviously not a fan of her parenting style. She literally has never corrected him ONCE when we\u2019ve been around. \n\nSo this weekend we\u2019re having our girls 1st birthday party. At my best friends house. That is 100% not baby proofed. They have a large dog that is extremely friendly and in your face. There will only be 3 other kids there. They all are older and well behaved. We gently gave her a heads up about all of that, and originally she said that that\u2019s fine and she\u2019ll leave him home with his dad. Then randomly last night she texted my husband and said she had a change of plans and wanted to know if it was okay to bring him. My husband handled it and as kindly as he could told her it wasn\u2019t the best idea. She\u2019s obviously not happy about it. But she said she\u2019d figure something out. \n\nI can admit I 100% just don\u2019t want to deal with it. I want to focus on my girls big day. I want my family and friends to have fun. None of us want to have to keep an eye on a kid that isn\u2019t ours, because my SIL will not. Without a shadow of a doubt, I know she will not pay attention to him. \nBut I know he\u2019s just a small kid and deserves fun too. \n\nSo AITA for asking my SIL to not bring him?

If he torments the dog and the dog defends itself, there will be life and death consequences for the innocent dog. That alone is reason to hold the line against the tiny tornado of terror - I mean your SIL's precious angel boy. \n\nIf he destroys your friend's house, who will pay for the damage? She is a neglectful parent. In general, their MO is \"oh well, kids will be kids . . .\" and expect everyone around them to foot the bill for their precious angels. In the absence of her paying up, who will? \n\nAlso, be aware that this problem will only get worse until someone puts in the work to make it better. You think he's bad as a 3 year old? Wait a few years when he's grown enough to reach light switches and countertops. \n\nYou are wise to draw the line now. \n\nBe warned, though, your own parenting is now in her crosshairs. If your child becomes a tiny terror, be assured she will point it out and laugh.", "NTA - if she is going to let her child run wild like a feral animal and do nothing to start teaching him appropriate behavior, you have absolutely every reason in the world to not want him in your house. This is your baby's day and you should not need to worry about Destructo the Rampaging Beast tearing through the house and making everyone crazy. Your sister's going to find out that what's cute in a three year old become significantly less amusing as they get older and the scope of damage gets bigger. This child will be very unwelcome among his peers and his school classes if he is not taught age appropriate restraint. 3 years old is plenty old enough to start to learn that he is not Godzilla stomping through Tokyo.", "NTA. You've handled it well so far. In the future maybe a different type of party - say, at a public playground or park - might be a better setting for him. I'm guessing this will result in some turmoil with SIL but what can you do...it's hardly fair to invite a destructive, unmonitored toddler into someone else's house. Maybe this will be the nudge she needs to start curbing his behavior.", "NTA. This party is not in your home, so it would be rude to the hosts to knowingly invite your disruptive and destructive nephew. Plus, won\u2019t he cry to hold your baby there too?  I\u2019d worry about him being crazy with the baby near a pool. Your SIL is not doing her son any favors by encouraging his behavior. His future teachers won\u2019t like him and they will talk about his awful mom!", "Sounds like it's handled, so no judgment needed. Sometimes kids like this learn to behave when they become school-aged and don't get all the positive attention for their antics. You can only hope.", "NTA. Your SIL has decided that her child\u2019s behavior is funny, so now she has to live with the consequences of that decision. And, this party is not at your house - it is at a friend\u2019s house. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing if a family member goes wild at a family member\u2019s home - it\u2019s something else if it is at the home of someone they don\u2019t know and they don\u2019t care if anything gets knocked over or broken. You have to protect your friend, not your SIL\u2019s feelings. \n\nI\u2019ll have to second what someone else said - be prepared for your SIL to show up with her kid anyway, assuming it\u2019s easier to say sorry than to ask for permission, and she will assume you won\u2019t push the issue and embarrass her by turning her and the child away (and then have to apologize to your best friend as the child breaks things at her house).", "NTA\n\nSIL might think her kid is hilarious but you do not.

But protect your peace. You have every right to do so.", "NTA.  Is it bad I came out of that story going 'wow, that kid is the least picky toddler ever'!  Which sounds great unless you know that toddlers being picky is supposed to keep them from eating random stuff they find that could kill them.   That kid is going to get horrible food poisoning one day, or get badly hurt.  So many corrections for a three year old are to keep them safe!", "NTA\n\nIf she carries this on it will end badly!", "Nah, she asked and seems like she accepted the no. She getting in to ah territory on not parenting her child or paying attention to him out and about.\n\nYou are not ah for it sounds like the most responsible choice.", "NTA, but your sister, on the other hand is, she is letting her son do things that could get him injured. Someone needs to intervene and get her help because she is the problem. SIL said her kid would want to hold the baby,  absolutely insane. He would probably her your baby.", "NTA if she brings that child to your friends not-babyproofed house, bad things are going to happen. No one will have a good time.", "My sister has a set of twins (9m). They are a nightmare, and it's mostly due to my sister and her husband's lazy parenting. They also think it's cute when the boys do something atrocious. One of the many reasons I have cut her off is the lazy parenting, and thinking their terrible behavior is \"cute and funny\". The boys have repeatedly hurt my kids and my other nephew and nieces, and have broken many things such as toys, lamps, furniture, etc...

This is your friend's house we're talking about. You can't do that to a friend (and to her dog!). \n\nMaybe it's time to sit down and have a serious talk with your SIL about keeping him in check when he's at family events. I know she'll hate you, but otherwise you'll be beating around the bush like this for a long time to come.", "NTA.  It is not your house.  Is she going to pay for things if he destroys them in the hosts house?  A 3 year-old can be told no, stopped, and put in a short time out or removed from the situation.

She\u2019s a really good dog, but I know any dog pushed to it\u2019s limits could get aggressive. So that alone is enough to keep the kid away. \n\nAnd you\u2019re right. They wouldn\u2019t pay for a dang thing that would end up destroyed. They\u2019d laugh it off and say oops. \n\nAnd even if my kid ends up being a little shit, I\u2019d still try to actively correct her and fix the issues. So she can laugh and judge all she wants.

There was some back and forth. And her trying to bargain. It just ended with her accepting it. \nAnd I\u2019m just trying to complain about the kid, as much as complain about the mom. I\u2019ll be the first to admit that I\u2019m less than a fan of her, but I don\u2019t want to punish the kid because of her parenting."]}
