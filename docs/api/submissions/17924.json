{"id": 17924, "submission_id": "13ouv5x", "title": "AITA for not spending the weekend with my family because there's going to be a child present?", "selftext": "I (26F) have been raised by my grandma since I was one and we lived next to my aunt and uncle who had a farm. By the time I was around 8, my aunt had two kids. I started to get shipped off to her house a lot and was expected to babysit all day while they worked on the farm. I made my cousins food, fed them, played all day with them, bathed them, changed their dirty diapers, put them to bed and I was also cleaning the whole house. Sometimes if my aunt and uncle came home and I didn't clean, they would make me feel guilty for it. They would sometimes bring me along to activities with their family and buy me clothes (grandma was poor) and would use that to make me feel bad about not doing chores. My cousins were the worst sometimes. Their parents were always fighting and also yelling at them, just overall being toxic and not meeting their basic emotional needs, so they were difficult to deal with. They also came a lot to my house and they were always up my ass. I couldn't sleep alone, they were fighting to sleep in my bed or sit next to me at the diner table or they would have a tantrum if I wouldn't take a bath with them. If I complained or said no, my grandmother and my aunt would jut berate me until I said yes. I felt like I had no power over myself. Anywhere we were going like restaurants or family functions, I was expected to take care of them or any kids present. I was basically a built in nanny and maid. Anyways, I moved out at 17 to a city a couple of hours away from my hometown. I don't talk a lot to my family and they don't talk to me as well. I started to have a relationship again with my grandmother, and for the most part it's going well. It all leads us to this weekend. I was expecting to spend my time off with her and my great aunt, but then she told me that a 7 year old girl (my great aunt's granddaughter) was going to be there, and that she was so excited to spend time with me. I asked why and my grandma said \" well because me and your great aunt are old ladies, it's going to be nice for little girl to have someone closer to her age\". Y'all. What can I possibly have in common with a 7 year old? The PTSD kicked in and I had a panic attack, I felt like I was expected to entertain a child yet again because I was always automatically expected to before. I told my grandmother I wasn't coming anymore because I was too anxious and she tried to get me to come anyways but it was too late, the whole thing was spoiled for me. My grandma sounded sad and and we haven't talked since. I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. I feel bad because she's getting old and I should be spending more time with her, but my mental health is precarious and I'm just always on my guard with her and the rest of my family.

What your grandmother, aunt, and uncle did to you and your cousins is abusive. It is not okay to force parental responsibilities on any child let alone an EIGHT year old. You and your cousins all deserved caring parents/family who met your emotional and physical needs and you were all denied that. It is 100% okay to have boundaries around similar situations no matter who is trying to push the issue, and it is especially valid since your grandmother enabled the abuse to begin with.

You've paid all of your babysitting/nanny dues. Live your life, don't feel guilty for doing so either. If your G-ma can't have 1:1 time with you then so be it.

I want to go to therapy but when I talk about it I start to shake and feel sick. There\u2019s a lot more than just being a nanny and maid and it\u2019s hard to accept that I was neglected as a child because I was always taught to just get over any hurt I had, physical and emotional. Like one time I literally broke my leg and my grandmother wouldn\u2019t bring me to the hospital. I couldn\u2019t walk on my leg for about 4 months, but when my cousin and my brother broke their leg, they were immediately taken care of. Every body was verbally abusive to my grandmother except for me, I always tried to help her and comfort her when she was crying because of my family members, but for some reason, she always gave everything to the people abusive towards her and asked nothing of them, but everything of me. I gave so much, I can\u2019t give anything anymore.", "This.\nNTA", "I\u2019m a psychologist and I work with a lot of trauma - many of my clients had similarly abusive/neglectful childhoods (as did I), so I understand how hard this is to talk about.\n\nIf you do want to try therapy, don\u2019t start with the trauma. Tell your therapist that you want help setting boundaries and developing coping skills for anxiety - you can slowly work your way up to the trauma and start getting into it when you feel ready. With a lot of my clients, we spend *months* developing coping skills before we go into the past. Sometimes we\u2019ll start on the trauma, only to realize they aren\u2019t ready - so we put a pin in it until they are.\n\nA good therapist will be able to help you assess your readiness for trauma therapy, and they won\u2019t push too far - they\u2019ll meet you wherever you\u2019re at", "It might be better for you to remove her from your life. I know that sounds harsh but I think she took enough from you.", "I'm so sorry. Your childhood sounds traumatic. It's probably difficult to see when you're in the wrong (as an adult), because you spent your entire childhood being \"in the wrong\".\n\nI can tell you without hesitation that you are NTA here. I also think you need to put some strict boundaries in place with your gran, if you do want to continue the relationship.\n\nThe first one would be: do not change our plans without consulting me. If you do, I will not visit and we'll have see each other some other time.\n\nThe second one might be: if I'm visiting you, I do not want to spend with other people.\n\nThe 3rd one might be: I have no interest in children so don't expect more than the bare minimum of courtesy from me if you've invited children. I will not chat, play, supervise, entertain, or anything else. Don't even ask.\n\nOf course, you need to think about what your personal boundaries are. I just made some up based on the story you shared.\n\nThe trick is explain in a very natural way, and without getting visibly emotional, what is and is not acceptable to you. And then stand your ground. Don't be swayed by guilt, bribes, or threats of blackmail."]}
