Would you want your daughters in relationships like this? Do you want your sons to think that it\u2019s okay to treat their partners like this?", "Hang on what year does he think this is? I can't think what year a man did absolutely nothing. How does he think leaving garbage everywhere is OK. How does he think any of what he did was OK. Oh I'm forced to care for my OWN children overnight I won't bother even clearing up. I'm going to pack a bag and go stay with my mommy when wife gets home I'll go. He's being a huge child. You're probably going to have it easier while he's gone. You'll only have 4 kids to deal with. You should probably divorce him. Start getting your ducks in a row. All official documents speak to a lawyer. Seek full custody probably wouldn't fight it because that means he'd have to care for them.", "ESH\nYour husband is obviously an incompetent ah for refusing to step up and learn how to manage being a parent \n\nBut\n\nUltimately you knew he couldn\u2019t handle it and you chose to make this an entire weekend getaway which only punished your kids. They\u2019re the ones who had to live in filth. \n\nDocument the way the house was when you came home and get a divorce lawyer.", "NTA but your husband sounds abusive", "NTA. Congratulations on getting rid of the 27yo child.  Tell him to step up or not come back.", "ESH. I would say you're not the AH if you knew for sure he could do the job. But what if something bad happened? What if there were an emergency? You weren't reachable. Your kids literally could have died or been abused or he could have left them with a stranger. Definitely divorce your husband, he's deadweight.", "I think you're about to find out it's easier to be a single parent than to have dead weight as a spouse.", "NTA. All the people slamming this woman, for leaving her children with their FATHER! The other person whose supposed to be a parent but can\u2019t be bothered ? And yet it\u2019s her fault is it? I don\u2019t think so. He calls her screaming his head off because he can\u2019t be bothered to do his part of the parenting and partnership. She isn\u2019t a maid, or a nanny, or a housewife, she has a career as well, even if she didn\u2019t why should she be in charge of everything. That\u2019s crap. If he couldn\u2019t handle his own home with her gone he shouldn\u2019t have screamed at her and maybe listened when she spoke. He knew where she was, she was with her friends. If they have family nearby he could have called them too\u2026 Oh. But that would make him look bad. So instead everyone\u2019s being mean to her. Yeesh.", "Nta \nBut I would leave cause it took both yoy to make rhe kids so it's both of yous jobs to feed wash and looking after \nHe's an asshole a big one at that \nIf there is anyway for u to work away from home and put your kids into day care so he can stop saying u have an easy job crap and then see how much that you do", "NTA. You don\u2019t have a husband, you have 5 children", "OP is basically a single mom already.", "Atleast if they are divorced she\u2019ll get child support!", "What is this, the 60s? Wait, no. Even my grandfather didn't do this. OP's husband belongs in the freaking stone age...", "\ud83d\udcaf agree. This is not a marriage. Hope for your sake he never comes back.", "Yup. All I could say is...\n\nGood riddance!", "You'd hope, but given how far this guy's head is up his own ass it's a pretty safe bet that mommy dearest helped him get it there. Especially since he obviously feels comfortable running to her even when he's so clearly and obviously in the extreme wrong.", "He\u2019s ready to leave because she snuck out without telling him.", "I\u2019d recommend you pack two sets of suitcases and drop them and the kids off at his mums too. If he expects you to clean the place, he needs to look after the kids and give you some additional free time too. If he wants to complain, he can go push four 8 pound turds out his asshole.", "Yeah I agree, however she did leave her kids there too without notice.. and with someone she knew was incapable of caring for them..??\nSo ESH for me because of that..", "But when she did try to talk to him about it, he shut her down. He sounds manipulative and controlling. She needed to get out to see it. Nta", "But maybe this got her to realise how much he sucks. She needed to get out of it to see it. Nta and either counseling or divorce. This man is *not* a partner.", "Abandoned her family? Because hubs is incapable of taking care of his own kids??\n\nSorry no. If she had planned to leave for the weekend he would have either complained until she canceled or made her do so much prep and planning (meal prep / hire babysitters) that he wouldn\u2019t have actually done real work while she was gone.  This was the only way to show him how much work she does and she did it.", "I agree, though OP is more of an AH to the kids than anyone else. \n\nAs the current breadwinner myself sometimes i need to clarify things with my partner if I'm having a day with the kids without him. Nap times change, eating habits change etc. I guarentee the kids were ripped out of routine.\n\nThat said, I get it. And OPs husbands reaction is VERY telling.", "He does it on the daily, sounds like", "This x100000", "My husband was there, he just went to bed before all the children did.\n\nI left the note right on his night stand table on his phone so it'd be hard for him not to notice", "Instructions? For his own kids? \nShe shouldn\u2019t have been gone the extra time without communicating, but husband is a true Asshat if he needs instructions on how to be a parent when mom is away.", "This is the exact scenario everyone advises when the spouses doesn't pull their weight.\n\nNow it's ESH. What is OP supposed to do to get through to this asshole? Clearly talking doesn't do anything.", "Left him without instructions? It\u2019s sad that people normalize a man needing instructions for taking care of his own children. And even sadder when women normalize that.", "I don\u2019t think Op husband gonna be fighting for custody\u2026he had to have his kids for 2 days and was terrible at it, and ran right off to his mommy\u2019s house once OP returned.  Trust me ,she won\u2019t have to worry about losing custody ever.", "OP did not leave the children alone. The husband was home asleep when she left. And she didn\u2019t do it because she was tired of watching them or dealing with them, she left to prove a point to her AH husband.", "Yes he must have been quivering in fear, having to be a father to his own children.", "\"But 4 kids is lot\" yet it's ok for him to sleep or go out with friends and leave her to all the childcare and housework? Hypocrite.", "With extra work. It's amazing the amount of housework a single adult can create when they're not putting any effort into cleaning up after themselves. And demanding home-cooked meals.\n\nWorking full-time plus all the housework plus all the at-home childcare for 4 kids? Yeeesh. That's going to exhaust anyone. She can lighten the load by decreasing the number of people making a mess and requiring mental and emotional upkeep. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Let\u2019s be real: a single mom would have less to do.", "With financial help", "After he told her she couldn\u2019t go have an evening out with friends, even though he regularly spends times with his.", "Lmao right. OP husband acting like he\u2019s a single bachelor, not a man with 4 kids.", "He has had 5 years to learn how to take care of his children. There is no excuse for him being incapable of caring for them for 24 hours. What if OP were in the hospital instead? Would the house just fall apart? He is a terrible partner if she can't even rely on him to be able to take care of his own kids for an extended length of time.", "So you're cool with your partner disappearing for a weekend with no prior warning, leaving you solo with four kids under 6? There is zero reason to do that. It doesn't make a point, its irresponsible.", "I am a breadwinner with a husband who is essentially a SAHD (he is employed in a position with maximum flexibility except on occasions that we can plan around months in advance.) I cannot imagine ditching my family and while the husband's reaction is pure asshole behavior, the kids are suffering with his inadequacy and the repercussions don't seem worth it when there are four children dealing with someone who will scream and cuss someone out rather than be relieved she's not hurt or something. I know my husband would assume it was a crisis, not a binge of partying and avoiding my family.", "It's a -tiny- bit better but not much. If he's sleeping, he still can't react to an emergency unless he's able to be woken up out of it. At the very least maybe if he knew ahead of time, he could turn up any baby monitors (if you still have them) and be able to know that he needs to react immediately. You both need to communicate with each other better.", "Right wtf", "I 100% agree with you there, dont get me wrong.\nI only mentioned the instructions because the husband has never taken care of the kids by himself and OP knows that.. so in the best interest of the kids her hubby needs instructions when left alone with them. .", "Like I said I think the hubby deserved this exact treatment, cause he sucks...\nSadly this approach put her kids in a bad situation... and they are innocent in all this.. so thats why I went ESH becaude it affected the kids...\n\nHonestly OP needs to sit hubby down and tell him how it is and take drastic matters if he still refuses to listen..", "How is it normalized when it is in the context of the husband being a useless AH? No one is saying men need instructions to care for their children in general, they are saying this particular AH of a man, who everyone but OP agrees is a useless AH needs them. Not because he\u2019s a man, but because he has not been contributing as a parent \u2014 a fact he is being rightly ridiculed about. It is still a fact, though, that it is incredibly unlikely he knew how to properly care for his children without some instruction, and those children deserve proper care.", "I don\u2019t think they\u2019re trying to normalize it but ultimately leaving him to just figure it out on his own only punished the kids because he clearly doesn\u2019t GAF", "If you read at the bottom I said yta for how you handled this. This isn't about him, she asked if she is an AH. Break through all the relationship stuff she didn't talk to him at all she just left. She asked about her behavior and rather than talking or explaining she left a note and walked out. \nShe didn't say anything about him going out on weekends so we don't know that.", "Which she'll get anyway when they divorce, because her useless husband certainly isn't going to fight for custody. He'll be paying child support.", "Yes", "I agree with you a 100%...\n\n\n>There is no excuse for him being incapable of caring for them for 24 hours.\n\nThere really is no excuse for it! I agree!\n\nHOWEVER, he was incapable of caring for them (we all agree on the level of shittiness there) and OP knew that since she had been the only one caring for them EVER....\nSo because of that I feel like OP knowingly put her kids in a harmful situation just to make a point to her hubby... and thats why I vote ESH...\nEventhough I think the hubby is a toooootal AH...", "Her husband thinks looking after kids is easy and not work. So he can have an easy weekend not working while watching the kids. \n\nIf her husband were a responsible parent or partner I would agree that she should have given him notice. In reality he\u2019s an absolute ass who thinks her time has no value so he got as much notice as he deserved. \n\nWhile I feel a bit sorry for the kids, one weekend of lots of screen time and junk food won\u2019t kill them.", "At the bare minimum her kids don\u2019t deserve it. They deserve to have a clean house and a competent parent. She clearly knows her husband can\u2019t handle it so she\u2019s only punishing her kids.", "He wouldn't wake up because he believes SHE will. He won't step up as a parent because he believes SHE will.", "This.", "Yes he will but that will be less than what he contributes to bills now. I\u2019m not defending the guy I\u2019m just being real about what will happen", "Your point?", "She isn't responsible for her husband's weaponized incompetence.", "So, you agree that she put her children in unnecessary danger? I can\u2019t tell, but it sounds like you and HolyGonzo are saying essentially the same thing with different emphasis (theirs is on the kids safety, and yours is on parental equity). But, I read it like you are arguing - but without actually disagreeing about the situation. Am I missing something? I\u2019m not trying to be difficult, but just genuinely asking from confusion and curiosity.", "True.\nShe is responsible for her childrens wellfare though..?\n\nI love to see that we are argueing this btw, while we both agree that OPs husband is a sh**head... I just state that her approach towards it could have been better... but yeah lets argue about how we both think that the hubby s*cks...-.-"]}
