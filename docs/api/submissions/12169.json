I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s always been this way or it\u2019s new, but you need to find a way to set him straight. It\u2019s not solely your job to raise your children, it\u2019s both of yours.

If I wake up to my kids crying and my wife is asleep next to me, I hop out of bed to handle the situation \u2014 but if she is not in bed, I assume she is handling it and try to go back to sleep unless/until she asks for reinforcements. I\u2019ll tune out all kinds of yelling when I believe my wife is handling it, and the way I know if she is or not is based entirely on whether she is in the bed or not. She does the same thing.

This may not be common, but it works for us and it\u2019s how we do it.\n\nWith that in mind, it is conceivable to me that husband could wake up to an emergency, not know what was happening, notice OP wasn\u2019t in bed, assume she was handling it, and go back to sleep. On the other hand, he would be more likely to check it out if he knew OP wasn\u2019t home.\n\nI\u2019m surprised this is such a controversial concern, but I can definitely see why it could matter just based on my own family.

Take your kids to him, amd get the hell out. What a useless piece of dirt. NTA", "Here, lemme do it for you: OP, leave this AH. You can do better with a smaller workload and child support, free of verbal abuse.", "Can confirm. My husband\u2019s extended family is like this. His aunt tried so hard to raise her son to be useful because her husband was not. He\u2019s an adult now and he comes to holidays and sits on his ass barking at people (well, women) to bring him things. \n\nI was raised by a capable father who did a lot and my husband also had a father who cooked and cleaned so I have one of the good ones. My FIL Will occasionally say something indicating the childcare is more my job than his but he\u2019s still petty progressive for a boomer.", "I don't include mine because I was raised by a single mom. Nothing to copy", "My wife has taught our daughters to cook, clean, and do laundry. I've taught our sons.\n\nI've taught our sons to change the oil, fix a hole in the drywall, use a table saw, and change the furnace filters. My wife has taught our daughters.\n\nI might do the home maintenance and my wife might do the laundry but we're both capable and willing to take on each other's responsibilities without complaint if the need arises.", "It\u2019s the same as ridiculing girls for \u201cfatherless behavior\u201d / \u201cdaddy issues\u201d without considering the absent father as the ones who should be ashamed for being absent", "When we were first living together, my husband had to travel a lot for work. So naturally I would make sure the house was clean before he got home, no matter what state it was in when he left. \n\nBut, when \\*I\\* would travel for work, I would come home to the house EXACTLY THE SAME as I left it. So if I left a dish in the sink because I was running out the door to catch my flight, that dish would still be in the sink. He would clean up all HIS dishes he used while I was gone, so at least the house wasn't MORE of a mess. But MY dish was, apparently, MY responsibility. \n\nI let him have it after the second or third time it happened, and luckily he got the message (he's way better now about all chores in general 15+ years down the road). I can laugh about it now but at the time I was flabbergasted!", "Yep. Instead of four children she has five children, and one of them is a giant entitled asshole.", "First and most importantly, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to do all of that. You shouldn\u2019t have that much responsibility at this time in your life. I hope things somehow get better for you in the near future. Or if you were referring to the past, I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that and I hope things are better now \u2764\ufe0f\n\nWhen it comes to the question of \u201chow can one or two people produce such a large volume of mess in a small amount of time?\u201d, I think it boils down to this:\n\nPeople that create huge messes in small amounts of time don\u2019t function like you or me. Whereas you or I would naturally put things away when we\u2019re finished using them, or wipe down the counter *immediately* after making a mess, or bag up and take out the trash the second it\u2019s full, or throw *all* of our dirty clothes in the hamper, or flush the toilet after we use it, or rinse a dirty dish and put it in the dishwasher the *second* we\u2019re done using it, or throw our trash in the *garbage* as opposed to leaving it on surfaces or *worse*, tossing it onto the ground-*these* types of people don\u2019t do **any** of those things. \n\nTo us they\u2019re just \u201creflexes\u201d-actions that we don\u2019t even consciously think about and that take incredibly little time; but to them, these actions are seen as \u201cmore work\u201d that they justify not doing because they don\u2019t feel like it, don\u2019t have the time, don\u2019t have the energy, etc. \n\nAt least that\u2019s the conclusion *I\u2019ve* come to after 8 straight years of working as a housekeeper.\n\nEdit: wording", "It's weaponized incompetence because he puts his anger at his wife over the well-being of his kids.", "Communicate, schedule and delegate. \n\nShuffle the kiddo off to grandparents or a friend, have a date night in (or out before/after an at-home meeting over coffee/tea) and create a domestic work schedule. \n\nGrab a binder. Outline in writing which partner is responsible for which tasks. Break down the list into yearly, seasonal, monthly, weekly and daily tasks. Create a task list for each room and break down *every single task* needed for both a deep clean and a standard cleaning of that room. Then you want to create monthly and weekly schedules that list who does what on each day of the week. \n\nYour partner should know exactly what is required of each task so he has no way to feign weaponized incompetence. If you have to write \u201cscrub dishes in soap on both sides, then rinse\u201d instead of \u201cwash dishes\u201d and \u201cwash baby\u2019s clothes in hot water with free and clear detergent\u201d instead of \u201cwash baby\u2019s clothes\u201d\u2014do that too.", "Same. Stop doing his laundry, he can do it. Have home make his own lunches. Get him to take over making dinner once a week etc. start making those changes now!", "How is he now? Does he contribute, but not quite enough? Does he expect you to do everything?\n\nDefinitely have him read this: [https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/](https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/)\n\nETA: and a later comic by the same artist: \n\nhttps://english.emmaclit.com/2022/09/01/where-does-it-go/", "Unfortunately it\u2019s too late for this conversation. You have set yourself up to caretake two people. You will be posting your frustration soon after giving birth.", "Have your conversation. When you come home with the baby, get him involved right away. Make sure he spends much time taking care of it. When you go, say, to the store or get a break with friends, do not set him up with a list or diapers or clothing for the baby. He's on his own. If you're holding his hand and 'finding' everything for him, it will always be your job. He can find his way around fatherhood just as you will around motherhood. He will have his own way of taking care of baby. He will not do things just like you do. As long as he and the baby get their own rythm and it's healthy, let him have his own relationship with baby. He will learn what the baby needs. He can find and decide what baby will wear and what he eats and when. Helping him is good. Criticism is not. There will be a difference in the way you both care for the baby. That's what makes unique relationships.\n\nMom's usually take on everything and sometimes Dad's are left in the dark. Experience is the best teacher. Good luck.", "His mom will deserve it. Who do you think raised him to believe wives are just domestic slaves?", "Oh my, that is enraging!  I\u2019m glad he\u2019s got better!", "Yep, my BIL and his wife divorced after 21 years of marriage. As he describes it, \"I now have just three children instead of four.\"\n\nNone of us were really sorry to see him divorce (now ex-SIL). Though it was difficult initially, his life has improved exponentially since he divorced SIL and he is getting remarried to a wonderful woman this spring.", "Agree ! Surprised he bothered to feed them .", "To clarify: the mess-makers usually don\u2019t even *realize* it. I\u2019ve been working to become more aware of my messiness tendencies. It\u2019s truly astonishing to look around me & ask, where did all of this crap even come from???", "I think he just couldn\u2019t handle it. Twin boys at that age? No aim. Totally normal. 4 small children and no practice,of course the house was a wreck.", "Way to be completely unhelpful", "Hopefully new girlfriend realizes that there's a potential for twins if she does have kids too.", "Did you study \"asshole narcissist adult male\" in college?", "That's 100% dependent on what state they live in. Some states don't have any alimony option at all, other states are more generous or have fewer requirements.\n\nThat said, she should definitely document everything including taking photos of the state of the house when he'd been in charge for a mere two days. I agree that this isn't a \"supervised visitation only\" situation but it is absolutely grounds for awarding her primary custody because he's incapable of providing the children with a safe home environment.", "I don't know what he was thinking?! What was supposed to happen is that he was supposed to get a good job and then I could throw myself wholeheartedly into my business. I was a teacher but there's no earning power there but I have a very lucrative skill.\n\n However,  he decided that he had worked for 20 years in the military and he was done. I told him you can't be done when we have children as young as seven and I have no earning power as a teacher! He had told me his entire career that I would never have to worry about going back to work because as a medic he would have really good job offers when he got out of the army. And he did! He had one working in Kuwait doing the same thing he did in the military just working for one year (and of course that would be tax-free) for $250,000 and he turned it down saying \"nobody needed that kind of money.\" And then he decided that the only stable jobs were working for the government itself. No other industry anywhere was considered stable (like working at a hospital wasn't stable??) I found that very interesting because plenty of people work for hospitals and don't have any trouble keeping their jobs. So he just decided never to work again. Which apparently was way more stable than not working for the government?? I do not understand the thought process here.\n\nSo while I'm working my four jobs and coming home from substituting (I couldn't get a full-time job where we were because you had to have a master's degree and I did not have one) he would ask ME what was for dinner that night! Like he wasn't home all day and couldn't fix dinner?? His excuse was always I\" didn't know what you wanted\"-- as if at any point in the 16 years that I stayed home with the kids and had a meal on the table ready when he came home that I EVER asked him what he wanted for dinner. It was like a fifth child and the most childish fifth child. It came down to the fact that he had always had somebody telling him what to do since he joined the military at 17 and now there wasn't anybody telling him what to do and therefore he didn't know what to do.", "This whole story reminds me of my ex, he\u2019s done this exact thing in my bathroom. We had a horrible fight and I wanted to chill in my room for a while. I took a roll of toilet paper with me since I was running low. \n\nApparently I was running low in the other bathroom too, which I had no idea about. He assumed I did it to spite him and shook piss literally all over the bathroom. It was even on the mirror. \n\nYep, that was the final nail in the coffin. We were together for years and he wrote me this long heartfelt note but literally none of it mattered, all I could think about was how he threw a pissy baby tantrum (and all of the many other horrible things he did when he didn\u2019t get his way)", "As a kid who spent every other weekend with his grandparents, I wouldn't trade the relationship I had with my grandfather for anything in the world.  It was _the_ foundational relationship in my life.", "The occurrence of twins is decided by the mother, not the father", "No judge is ever going to give this asshole full custody, ever.", "Except\u2026I\u2019m pretty sure he did know what to do. Just didn\u2019t want to do it.", " I'm sorry you had to go through that, it sounds awful and exhausting.", "God it's like he just went yah im done with being a grown up. And also stopped you from doing what you wanted or needed to do as well what a dick! I know leaving and starting over was super hard but you did the best thing for you kids and hell even now he's not got to support them fiancially if he cant, all he's got to do is be a good figure in their life and he can't even do that.
