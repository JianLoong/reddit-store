Not to mention but your mother is going to be so hurt. This is a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nOP is there any way to can work overtime or get a second job so that you can earn the money yourself? I would definitely do this if you can and then you husband can\u2019t complain. If you can\u2019t then can you tap into a retirement account and take out a loan. In the US we have 401k\u2019s where your contributions are pre tax dollars and you can borrow from it and pay the loan back with pretax income as well.

Some things are more important than money and this trip for your mum is one of those things. Quite worrying that he can't see how important it is to you and your family. It would be understandable if you genuinely couldn't afford it but his whole argument is just that he wouldn't get to go on a nice holiday one year.

Also, only the cruise costs that much. Did you think about all of the other costs? Going down in each of the ports, museums, tours, transportation, taxis, food, mementos you want to buy? \n\n\nI will get downvoted, but soft YTA. 2.5k (+the additional invisible costs) is a lot of moolah, and it doesn't sound like he is financially abusing you, but it is a lot of money which is not budgeted.

Why doesn't she pay for all three of you if it is so important?\n\nSounds like there in more information missing.  Is there a history of you being this flippant about financial matters?

You will be landing in various cities where you will be responsible for your expenses....and those can add up.\n\nWhy do you and your husband have to go on this cruise?

That will greatly impact your ability to save over time for things like retirement, for a house, and could be hard if you want to have kids.\n\nSo I can understand why he is a little hesitant. Is there any sort of work that you are able to do ? If you have until next summer, and you potentially were able to work part time, could you earn the $5,000 needed to cover the cost of the trip for you and your husband and that way you wouldn't have to dip into savings?", "NTA He is very controlling for a man with so much.", "YWNBTA.

Like sure your financials are one and the same, but if you don't work then I hope you do all/most of the chores if you are able? Cuz otherwise your husband has to cough up 5000$ for a trip he might not even really enjoy. That is a lot to ask of your partner. He might grow to resent you and your mother if you push this, he might feel like little more than an ATM. Is it responsible of your mother to go on this trip? Does she have enough money so that you (aka your husband) won't stand there and have to financially support her later when her lottery money runs out? If your husband is your support system and all that is keeping you afloat, then you need to support him too and see when you are asking for more than you should.

Almost 3 years again, he left his job and started a small business. It is tough. He doesn\u2019t have any salary at the moment BUT he invested in his shop (we are go-owner, but he pays the loan with the work he\u2019s doing). Whenever he can get a bit extra, he puts everything towards our child or groceries, even if I don\u2019t ask him to. He\u2019s limiting his expenses as much as he can. As a consequence, when he needs money I don\u2019t mind giving him some, and I regularly offer him gift. \nI hope he never feels \u2018inferior\u2019 because I\u2019m paying all the expenses, but I really appreciate that he doesn\u2019t consider it\u2019s his due that I pay for everything and does more than half the chores. \nWe are in a partnership and as much as I feel normal to share the money I earn, I appreciate that he doesn\u2019t feel entitled to it.\nSame the other way around: a few year back I changed job and got a huge pay cut (20%).

And if you are grateful, he could be just grateful to see you are doing your best despite your disability.\nFor me, success is a couple is only possible if neither of the partner feels entitled to anything, be it time, help or money.

We never take each other or any kindness we do for the other for granted.\nNot so clear in yours. When I read you, you sound entitled. I\u2019m sorry, that what I see. You don\u2019t seem to understand your husband\u2019s point of view. Did you propose anything to make the holidays with him still possible? \nIf he\u2019s already paying for everything, I don\u2019t see why he wouldn\u2019t pay for that too, unless he felt like he didn\u2019t have a choice or his feelings were not taken into account.\nIn your place, I would discuss it with him but in an humble way. \u2018How can we make it possible\u2019 \u2018what can I do to help\u2019 , etc. It should be a family discussion, not you asking for him to foot the bill for you to travel with you mom.", "I\u2019m disabled, I\u2019m doing a postgrad course, I have no way to make any money so why would I sit down and offer a monetary solution? Should I ask for an allowance? Ask him to pay me to do extra chores? Get a paper round? Your way of making it fair doesn\u2019t apply to my life so I\u2019m not sure how you think that is good advice."]}
