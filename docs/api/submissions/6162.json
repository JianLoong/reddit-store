Having him towed because he parked incorrectly *one day* is a gross overreaction.\n\n It inconvenienced you by about 5 minutes of extra walking, and you retaliated by forcing him to spend $300 that he may not even have been able to afford, having to spend the entire day of the impound, plus any possible damage to his car while it was being towed.  \n\nAlso, while it\u2019s not an excuse, you don\u2019t know the circumstances for why he had to park there. Maybe he was in a rush to get home because he just spent the night with his mother in the hospital. Maybe there was another car parked very close, and so he was  barely able to fit. The bottom line is that if this was an ongoing long-term problem, and you had left a note on his car, tried to make contact, and done all of the reasonable things which would give him a chance to correct the issue, and he refused, then you would be in your rights to have them towed. Or if he was blocking your car from getting out, to the point where you couldn\u2019t use your vehicle, then it\u2019s lawful to have them towed. But parking over the line one time where you subjectively claimed that your spot was not usable - and overreacting by having him towed - makes you the AH here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

OP tried to reach out to the neighbor to have them move their car but they were unable to get ahold of them. It doesn\u2019t matter the circumstances it doesn\u2019t give you the right to park like a dick and prevent others from parking in a spot that they are paying for. It would have taken him not even 10 seconds to fix his parking. He should know that if he\u2019s blocking someone else\u2019s spot that he\u2019s at risk of getting towed.", "The issue was it was storming and OP got the covered space to prevent damage to their car from hail and parking in open (uncovered) visitor's parking would allow damage to their car from hail.  The issue was the hail/damage not the walk.", "I would have think the truck guy is the major asshole parking halfway into OP spot.

The person parked over the line and deserved to have his car towed. Follow the rules. NTA", "So you want OP to be a doormat? They paid for a covered spot. They couldn't use it because of a bad parking job. They tried to get in touch with the neighbour.", "I think you\u2019re conflating two separate things. Your defense is to claim that the other driver should not have parked that way. I don\u2019t disagree with that at all. That\u2019s not the issue.\n\nThe issue was that the response was not proportionate. As OP stated, he had an alternative spot. The level of inconvenience was five minutes of walking and of course, the other driver could have moved his car, but they were never notified. For all we knew, there was some circumstance we can\u2019t think of or don\u2019t know about that forced him to straddle the parking line, and he was just dropping off some thing and running right back to his car to move it but never got the chance. We don\u2019t know and we\u2019ll never know. \n\nBut whatever the circumstances were, the response was completely disproportionate. Having the car towed on the very first infraction is a massive overreaction. Five minutes of inconvenience versus an entire day, hundreds of dollars, and potential damage to the vehicle. OP specifically said that this only happened one time.\n\nAlso, we are completely taking the word of a pier that this other car was parked, straddling the line with no other mitigating circumstances. Human beings are inherently very biased observers and so, without seeing any proof, all I know is, we may not be getting both sides of the story. Just going off of the information presented here, OP grossly overreacted", "Its a different take.\n\nif it was the first time? Why not first talk like civil people first, the are neighbours.\n\nYou don't call the cops on a neighbour the first loud party they have either do you?", "No, no doormat, but civil. \nLike I wrote elsewhere.\n\nYou don't call the cops on the neigbours the first time they have a loud party either. You first go have a chat. And yes that also  can be the next morning.\n\nSeems like many people are immediately agressive these days. Conversations are still something we can do, I hope.", "On the plus side, they\u2019re unlikely to do it again. One sharp shock = lesson learned = countless possible future issues avoided", "Disagree.", "\"level of inconvenience\" Was the damage to the car from hail which is why OP bought the spot.  It was badly storming when OP got home and that is why OP towed the neighbor to get OP's covered (hail free) spot back.  If it had been sunny, towing the neighbor would be different but it was storming and storms are why OP got the covered space.", "I disagree I think it was appropriate. OPs neighbor parked in a way which took up half of his spot, which is a dick move. I\u2019m pretty sure they weren\u2019t just running something in real quick as OP said it took an hour for the tow truck to get there and tow the car and it hadn\u2019t moved in that hour it took the tow truck to get there. If there was some reason why he couldn\u2019t park normally in his spot (which I highly doubt) that doesn\u2019t give him the right to take up half of OPs spot. You park like a dick without regards to others you pay the consequences. He could have easily avoided this by taking the extra time to not park like a dick.The neighbor has no one to blame but himself.", "OP got the covered space to protect their car from damage from hail.  It was literally storming while OP pulled up and OP had to park in an open space with storms (and potential hail pouring down) damaging their car.\n\nThe idea OP should wait, allow the hail to damage the car even though OP literally paid for that space to prevent this is a terrible take.\n\nIt is the neighbor's job, not OP's to park correctly or get 2 spaces if needed.\n\nIt is not OP's job nor should they tolerate damage to their car (which the neighbor will refuse to pay for) so the neighbor doesn't have to be responsible while parking.", "No you go knock and ask them to keep it down.

How could they have a conversation if the person didn't answer the door?", "Don\u2019t forget years of animosity! \n\nOf course instead of passive-aggressively \u201cteaching a lesson\u201d To his neighbor, he could have dealt with it like a functioning adult, spoken to his neighbor rationally and asked him not to do it again.

It\u2019s also way easier for the tow company to get money from the neighbor than OP.", "He said he knocked on the door once, while the neighbor wasn\u2019t there obviously. Before going to the drastic step of having the car towed just because you had to walk 5 minutes, you should allow ample time to talk to them and give them a reasonable chance to assure they won\u2019t do it again. Per OP it only happened one time and we don\u2019t know the circumstances behind it. \n\nLeave a note or just knock on their door at a reasonable hour when you expect them to be home.

Your neighbor, maybe an AH, maybe tired or oblivious.\n\nIMO its overkill to call for a tow on a first offense.  I'm surprised a tow truck would actually tow a vehicle in that situation.  From what I've seen in life, people tend to leave a note or contact property management for a first offense and escalate if it happens again.  There are all sorts of reasons people don't answer their doors when they aren't expecting company (I sure don't) so it's not like he was in there \"HAHAHA EFF YOU AND YOUR PARKING\"\n\nThere is always the possibility he didn't realize he was over the line and made a mistake, just like there is the chance he is an entitled asshat and knew he was over the line and didn't care.  Maybe he was the former and being towed turned him into an angry jerk so you'll never really know.  They caused you inconvenience and time and apparently potential risk of damage to your car, your payback included loss of a lot of money, probably fear and confusion about car theft, potential loss of job if they had to work and didn't show up on time.\n\nYour neighbor was totally in the wrong to make it so you couldn't park in your spot.
