You were again betrayed by yiour sister, it is unclear if it is intentional betrayal or thoughtlessness on her part time will tell. Your desire to keep your parents out of your life is just and you have every right to feel this way.", "Nta- Let\u2019s be real, Mormons are gonna Mormon.\n Also I after this deceit from your sister, I would be wondering what else she lied about?", "NTA\n\nThe only thing I would question is if your sister actually gave them the address, if they found it on their own, or if they tracked your sister.", "NTA. Your sister is young, yes, but not that young. She\u2019s certainly old enough to know that giving them the address would go against your wishes and therefore be a dick move.", "NTA. Your parents aren't a part of your life by their own choice, which means your sister essentially gave out your address to \"strangers\" you were intentionally not allowing to be part of your life, without your consent. It'd be different if she actually lived there, was on a lease, etc as she'd have her own rights as a renter, but you're absolutely not in the wrong here.", "NTA\n\nWhy would your sister make the people who disowned you come to your house...?\n\nDunno, kind of feels like she planned to do something between you and your parents when she said that they've changed. *But that's just speculation.*", "NTA-Even if they\u2019ve done total 180\u2019s it doesn\u2019t make it okay that she willfully ignored you stating you don\u2019t want them in your life and gave them your address. She\u2019s young but not so very young that her boundary stomping gets a free pass.", "NTA\n\nThey disowned you.  They lost all parental rights when they did that.   \n\nYou told your sister how you felt about your sperm donor and incubator.  She chose to \"forget\" /s.\n\nI think sister did that *intentionally*.", "NTA", "NTA. Since they disowned you, they don't have grandchildren. They're no longer part of your life.", "NTA. Your sister knew what she was doing and in doing so broke your trust.", "INFO, did sis know you did not want the parents to know your address?", "She knew what she was doing; she was trying to engineer a rapprochement. NTA.\n\nShe may, however, be right that your parents have changed and want to make amends. If that's true, would that change things for you?", "NTA but you probably should have communicated with your sister that you don\u2019t want your parents knowing where you live. I definitely agree with you wife that the situation could have been handled better.", "NTA for being mad at your parents. But you might want to be sure that your sister actually did give them your address. They could have tracked her phone and just shown up for example. I think you should talk to her and find out the truth, then decide what relationship you want with her. And if the parents just tracked her phone, you owe her a huge apology.", "NTA.  Nobody has the right to interfere with another's chosen path through life.  Sister knew she was violating brother's trust and so should endure the fate that brother decides is appropriate.", "NTA. I don\u2019t blame you one bit. Sister went underhanded with this move. \n\nIt\u2019s like that old adage. Go smash a plate in your house, then tell it you\u2019re sorry. You might be, but the damage is done. You being sorry doesn\u2019t fix the plate. \n\nAs someone with a hyper religious family I don\u2019t speak to, I never want any of those people at my house. One of my uncles lives less than a 5 minute drive away, but in the 2+ years he\u2019s lived here, he\u2019s never been invited. \n\nSister thinks your experiences are the same. She will never see the pain they put you through because they didn\u2019t put her through the same. She was already willing to betray your trust because she thought she knew better than you, being harsh is the only way to get it through thick skulls that you\u2019re not joking, you REALLY don\u2019t want a relationship with them.", "NTA. Just because their abuse of you didn't work before doesn't mean they won't try the same shit again. Your sister is young and dumb; you might be able to forgive her in time, but your parents have proven they can't be trusted with that kind of information and it's your job to maintain boundaries for your personal life. It is not your sister's or any one else's job to pester you into undermining your boundaries because a powerful religiously abusive personality demands it.", "INFO: it doesn't make a huge difference, but was the actions of the sister deliberate or accidental?", "INFO. Did you ever specifically tell your sister that you didn't want her to give your parents your address?\n\nJust because you're estranged from someone, it doesn't always follow that you're estranged to the point of them not knowing where you live. So is your sister a thoughtless 19 year old, who didn't realize giving out the address was a problem, or was she maliciously giving out information she'd been told not to?", "Im sorry you had to deal with this at such a young age. Happy you were able to create family and community. \n\nNAH except your parents of course. Does your sister drive? Was she giving them your address so they know where you live or so 1)they could pick her up or 2) they know where she is. \n\nI do think you need to seek therapy. And if you have, you need more. It\u2019s very clear you have not dealt with this is a healthy way. It may not hurt to sit down with your parents on neutral ground. You don\u2019t have to accept or even see them again after that. But it may be helpful to hear them take accountability, and get to speak your mind.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's a much longer conversation than I think OP had with the sister to figure out just what happened. In one way, it might just be a simple, minor miscommunication. In another, it could be horribly bad judgment on the part of the sister.
