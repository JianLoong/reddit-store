Nobody has the right to interfere with another's chosen path through life.  Sister knew she was violating brother's trust and so should endure the fate that brother decides is appropriate.", "NTA. I don\u2019t blame you one bit. Sister went underhanded with this move. \n\nIt\u2019s like that old adage. Go smash a plate in your house, then tell it you\u2019re sorry. You might be, but the damage is done. You being sorry doesn\u2019t fix the plate. \n\nAs someone with a hyper religious family I don\u2019t speak to, I never want any of those people at my house.

She will never see the pain they put you through because they didn\u2019t put her through the same.

Just because their abuse of you didn't work before doesn't mean they won't try the same shit again. Your sister is young and dumb; you might be able to forgive her in time, but your parents have proven they can't be trusted with that kind of information and it's your job to maintain boundaries for your personal life. It is not your sister's or any one else's job to pester you into undermining your boundaries because a powerful religiously abusive personality demands it.", "INFO: it doesn't make a huge difference, but was the actions of the sister deliberate or accidental?", "INFO. Did you ever specifically tell your sister that you didn't want her to give your parents your address?\n\nJust because you're estranged from someone, it doesn't always follow that you're estranged to the point of them not knowing where you live.

Was she giving them your address so they know where you live or so 1)they could pick her up or 2) they know where she is. \n\nI do think you need to seek therapy. And if you have, you need more. It\u2019s very clear you have not dealt with this is a healthy way. It may not hurt to sit down with your parents on neutral ground. You don\u2019t have to accept or even see them again after that.

It's a much longer conversation than I think OP had with the sister to figure out just what happened. In one way, it might just be a simple, minor miscommunication.

Parents are total AH, but the sister may or may not be.", "NTA\n\nGood for you for blocking the people that don't agree with regarding allowing poison back into your life.

Be ready to press harassment charges if they escalate (a similar thing happened to a friend of mine).", "Did you actually tell her not to give it to them? Then NTA.\n\nOtherwise possibly ESH (except parents - they sound like TA easily). She may not have even thought about it being an issue if they were her way home, so it could very easily have been a mindless mistake. And if you didn't make it clear that it would be a problem on top of that? So before burning your relationship with her, who you said having around was 'pretty great', maybe find out WHY.", "NTA. Yep at 19 your AH sister should have known better. You have every right to kick her out, especially knowing what your parents did to you. The word apostate sounds like a Mormon religion. I hate organized religion that tears up the family unit.", "There's two things here \r\n\r\nOne is that you can't just up and move anymore like you did last time, that is probably your main and proven coping mechanism and why you are so angry.\r\n\r\nTwo is that your sister who you put trust in caused this situation.\r\n\r\nTo address one, you need to realise that yes, your parents and by extension the church have your address now. You should take some steps such as security cameras and if possible (although maybe extreme) a security fence with electric gates so no one can actually get to the door of your house - these will help restore the sense that your house is still a safe space from the church without moving.\r\n\r\nIn addition, unlike last time you are a well equipped adult with a proven support mechanism in place, this won't be like last time and you can do things differently in a way that keeps them away for good if that is what you want.\r\n\r\nTo address two - think about how you felt when you left, and now your sister may need support. What she has done is bad, but I suspect she was acting on autopilot rather than malice. People react differently and you clearly got your shit together and got out, maybe she does not see it like this - she can't get out on her own or maybe now does not see a need to get out because of this apparent change. Regardless she grew up in a cult and is damaged, I don't known of you should forgive her but remember what it was like and see if you want to reach out again and help or at least explain why you acted as you did.\r\n\r\nI don't think you can bank on your parents having actually changed, I suspect, but don't know, that your family actually just wanted to keep their other child and any change was out of necessity and that probably means not much actual self reflection has happened on their part.\r\n\r\nAll that is to say - NTA and you do you, but remember \"Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty, if they forget what it was to be young\"", "INFO: Did you tell her, explicitly, to not pass your information?\n\nNTA for being upset but you should look deeply into Grandparents-Rights in your state. In some states they just need to file for visitation and can be accepted. I would also suggest not believing your sister's words anymore. Seems awful to make arrangements with the people you've gone NC with to pick her up.", "ESH. \n\n**You sister is 19 and lacks a whole lotta life experience. She made a bad call, and didn't mean to hurt you.** I think she deserves a little bit of grace in this situation.

Maybe not, but your sister is the asshole here. 19 is old enough to know better.", "NTA, very manipulative move and you know they will contact you now. She's trying to gaslight you into having a relationship with them again because they are probably constantly complaining about it to her. Who knows your sister might have even been sent there by them or to contact you on their request. If it doesn't escalate, I think you should apologize but I think we both know they are probably going to contact you several times.", "Even if they have completely changed, it still is unacceptable that she purposefully disregarded your request to be removed from their life and provided them your address.

Would she deliberately and traumatically remove them from her life, forfeiting any involvement with their future relationships and her possible future grandchildren, and leave them adrift in the cold world? \n\nMy guess is she\u2019ll be horrified and say she could *never.* Then ask her again if OP should have \u201chandled the situation better.\u201d", "why tf would that matter? if the parents changed their mind they have a conduit to speak to OP thru the sister or at least pass a message saying \"i'm sorry we were wrong\"\n\ninstead we have some goofy attempt for parents  to get OPs address and then have family berate them for leaving", "I need to know this too.

She **still** prioritized calming OP down (minimizing and invalidating) rather than immediately asking the interlopers to leave *because showing up in front of someone who you betrayed and abandoned at roughly the same age as the sister is now is bound to be incredibly shocking and upsetting, and any normal human with a functioning empathy pathway would understand OP would need a chance to gather their thoughts and gird their loins.*\n\nSister is trying to fix the rift in the way most convenient for her, not at all taking OP\u2019s needs or wants into account.
