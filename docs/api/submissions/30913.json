You've put up with enough.", "100% move out. NTA", "NTA, your home should be a place of peace and yours is not giving your siblings actions. You should move out.", "NTA, aren't they capable of working at least part time.  Instead they have this sense of entitlement that they are owed your things, can take what you have earned...etc, time to sour the milk and support yourself.  It's not like your leaving them homeless, your giving them a choice, sink or swim.  Good for you.  I wish you well.", "Before you do, see if you can catch them on video stealing from your room.  The issue is someone who gasslights like that will lie about everything, so expect your reputation to get slaughtered in your friend group by your sibling when you leave.  It will all be your fault, heartless, mean and probably a bunch of other lies.  It will most likely also take place online as they may try to turn remaining family against you.\n\nIf this happens, your response with video of them stealing from you should put a stop to it.

Time for sibling to figure out life for themself.", "NTA this is going to sound mean but people like your sibling disgust me. OP it\u2019s time to move out yesterday, you\u2019ve done more than necessary in supporting their ungrateful ass. They do not deserve your kindness, generosity and your support. You have taken advantage of by them time and time again, stealing from you and then had the audacity to lie to your face about it. Enough is enough, it\u2019s high time they learn actions have consequences.", "NTA  Get out and let them sink or swim on their own. You owe them nothing!", "NTA you should move out long time ago don't feel bad about this.", "NTA. You are under no obligation to support a sibling. Especially not someone who seems to be totally unapreciative. The stealing and the gaslighting is not something you would put up with from anyone else, I hope, so why put up with it from a sibling? The \"because fffffaaaammmmiiiilllly\" reason is old hat and has been for decades.", "NTA and I honestly didn't understand why you put up with this for so long", "NTA.  You should have done this a long time ago.", "NTA Move if you need to move.  This family member is a thief and has chosen to be abandoned by choosing this behavior.  Good luck out there.", "NTA. You're completely justified in your actions and feelings. You're not your siblings' safety net. Hope things get better once you move out.

You\u2019ve already done more than enough, especially given their thefts and gaslighting.\n\nHowever, make sure you are able to simply move out like that.  If your name is on the lease, the owner can come after you for rent when your sibling fails to pay.", "I think so too. I guess before I didn\u2019t want to believe who they\u2019ve shown me to be over and over again.

It\u2019ll help me move on easier if I have video proof but at the same time it makes me feel uncomfortable resorting to it.", "This is a great idea. A wifi camera with a view of your whole room. You can decide what to do with any footage, but having it is a great idea.", "Do you pay the rent but aren't on the lease? How did they qualify for an apartment?", "This sounds like psychopathic behavior, tbh.", "They dont feel uncomfortable doing it, so you shouldnt either.  I know its a tough one, but someone who steals and lies to you doesnt respect you at all, Family or not.", "This is going to sound weird, but it's OK to feel uncomfortable. I think because this behavior has gone on for so long, you may have been in denial of it, because maybe you don't want to believe it. Your very own sibling is a thief, and that is hard to face. But don't let the discomfort stop you ... you now have the choice to move on from this, or stay where you are and let it continue. Doing something different and standing up to toxic people, saying, \"This is not OK and I won't stand for it!\" might feel uncomfortable, if that makes sense. But down the line you might be proud of yourself \ud83d\ude42\n\nEdit: a word"]}
