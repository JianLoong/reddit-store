This is not the time to build relationships, it's a drop location, and parents got to go to work. 20 minutes is a long ass time. 20 minutes is a few?

Two sides of the same coin; both manipulative and both hard to tell without getting the full context. We don't have the full context because we weren't there. You are making a bias, anecdotal assumption. Maybe she did yell and didn't realize, or maybe she didn't yell and the teacher was lying to cover her own ass.\n\n\n***\n\n\nAlso, no one is obligated to adjust their behaviour because of the way someone feels. This is actually a very toxic mindset that abusers use to manipulate victims.\n\n> E.g a father feels uncomfortable with his wife breast feeding, even if she's in another room in their own house. Should she change and stop breastfeeding completely because he doesn't like it? Hell no.\n\n> E.g a paranoid woman is uncomfortable with the fact that a single father is taking his kid shopping. Does he change by abrupttly ending his shopping trip prematurely and going home? Hell no.\n\n> E.g you and your well-trained dog live in a pet-friendly apartment. In fact, the apartment owner specifically tries to seek pet owners as tenants because they're an animal lover and own a nearby lot that they've turned into a 'public dog park' with no entrance fees and only donations for maintenance. You have a neighbour that's is irrationally uncomfortable with your dog, even though your dog is quiet, respectful, and well-behaved. Do you adjust by moving out even though all the other apartments nearby are pet-free? Hell no.\n\n> E.g a homophobic parent is uncomfortable with the fact that their kid is homosexual. Does the kid just stop being gay? Hell no, and that is not something you can just stop doing.\n\n\nAll hypothetical examples sufficient to illustrate my point. If you still disagree, then that is extremely unhealthy and I urge you to seek help. The world does not revolve around you and it doesn't revolve around any other person. Everyone's boundaries and thresholds are different. I can only agree with your sentiment *IF AND ONLY IF* the boundary is reasonable, non-hypocritical, and both morally and legally widely agreed upon.\n\n\n***\n\n\nAnd lastly, It's not about \"waiting a few extra minutes\"; it's about  lack of professionalism and repeated failure to follow safety protocol. It is the *school's own rule* to have parents wait until staff sees the child. We also don't know if it will only be a few minutes longer, it might somehow end being 10 min or something. Parents have places to go: work, potentially drive their other children to another school, do errands etc.\n\nOP does *not* come across as entitled to me. I think she is justified being upset because\n1.  the school isn't enforcing *their own* safety policy     2. The teacher wasn't only wasting OP's time, but wasting everyone else's and potentially making them late    \n3. The teacher is unprofessional and not doing her job properly. Overseeing the safety of other people's children is not something to fool around with    \n4. It's an unsafe situation all around. The teacher's negligence is dangerous for everyone -- what if something happens to the child before they reach the gates? We don't know how the distance between drop-off zone and gate (for all we now it could be ridiculously far. I've seen some weird schools)\n\n\nI personally think you come across as self-absorbed as you are so insistent that your judgement, based only on your limited and sole world view, is fact. The teacher isn't customer service, sure, but she is still working a \"service job\" -- one that provides educational services to children. She still has responsibilities and part of that includes hearing out parental safety concerns. She is a teacher who's *liable for the students*, but isnt taking any accountability.\n\nIt would do you good to expand your world view before making rash and harsh decisions.", "NTA. recording the converstaion yourself was a great move!

I recorded it too.** \n\nI think you missed this.", "Depends on the teacher\u2026 my school\u2019s admin protected some real creeps", "I doubt it is the same one. It sounds like the kids are young. There really is not drop off past elementary school.", " Banning someone out right for poor behavior means a parent won't have access to their child- that even in an emergency they go straight to jail for stepping foot on school grounds. No more conferences with teachers, no more dropped off things the kid forgot, no more picking them up for doctors appointments.\n\nAsking them to acknowledge wrongdoing, apologize, and promise not to do it again is an incredibly generous compromise on admins end.", "I\u2019m on the school side and I only ever want to communicate via email. I hate the phone anyway but I want the paper trail.", "Right? How foolish of her to lie when cameras are everywhere these days. They just expected OP to back off.", "Gross \ud83d\ude1e On the rare occasion that they do protect teachers it\u2019s always ones like that", "OP wasn\u2019t in their car at the time, they had gotten out, walked to where the teacher was causing an obstruction, 3 cars forward.", "Info: I think we need to see.the videos.", "NTA. You're a real life Kirotake Ayanakoji", "NTA, but can\u2019t you park further and walk your kid up? I always see these crazy drop off lines when parking and walking is so much faster", "NTA.\n\nStupid power-tripping, pretentious people shouldn't be allowed to be around children sometimes.", "NTA. I\u2019ve encountered many rude and know it all VPs. You need to save a copy of the email. Download it to your computer. Forward it to a back up email. Districts have IT people that can delete emails from their district.", "NTA. Fuck it. Escalate this situation. They want an apology? They better fight for it.", "First thing you say is \u2018someone else recorded it? Fantastic, let\u2019s watch it together!\u2019\n\nThen make a big deal of it. Make an appointment with the Principal to watch the video together. When he calls back to cancel refuse to cancel. Show up and show him your video. He needs to know his teacher is a liar.\n\nNTA", "My school has cameras. Does yours? If so make a records request for the footage.", "NTA, and even though you filmed it as well, I would have been tempted to ask for the film that had me yelling and cursing to be fwd to me. What are you supposed to be apologising for? Asking how much longer they'll be because there's traffic building up?", "NTA what do you have to apologize for and honestly if you did record it you are amazing and I will use that to ur advantage.", "Nta- she is wasting people's time, lay on the horn next time till she moves on.", "NTA. I dont even see wny reason you need to apologize. You probably did a favor to all the 20 cars waiting behind you. Jts the teschers job to do what she is doing, while thr parents need to get going too, bcs they too either jage something to do or need to get to their job.", "NTA they lied and accused you of actions you did not make then backtracked, if anything they should be apologizing to you.", "NTA but you sound like one either way I say your just an unpleasant person", "NTA the teacher literally wasn\u2019t doing her job. she should\u2019ve spoke to this other parent on her own free time because this affected a lot of people. other kids need to be dropped off so they shouldn\u2019t be making everything about them. please definitely show them the video and you do not owe anyone an apology when they were the ones in the wrong for wasting everyone else\u2019s time!", "NTA.  No apology necessary, you weren't wrong.  I can't even figure out what an apology would sound like \"I'm sorry I called you out for not doing your job properly?\"\nThe VP was way out of line to lie to you about the recording and the issue should have been over when you said that you recorded the incident.", "No apology period, you did nothing wrong. Teacher needs to make some friends cuz she's too desperate for interaction to do her job properly.", "Apologies shouldn't be conditional - either decide to apologize or not. But what would you apologize for?", "She wasn't 'wrong', she lied though OP, don't apologise and NTA!", "I just think the VP believed the teachers side more and has a duty of care to their staff and ensure parents do not verbally abuse staff - which is a growing concern \n\nIn this instance, the VP should had apologised and that they were given a different story.", "Since when do adults need to eyeball kids entering school gates? A twenty car traffic jam!? \n\nProblems like this will only be eliminated by creatin walkable, accessible routes to school that kids can independently enter & leave.", "Agreed!! Why is everyone down with all this RECORD RECORD RECORD! Can\u2019t we just exist without having to try and catch each other out. I find the whole thing petty tbh. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if OP has a history at the drop off line. This time she may not have yelled, but did previously, so this time she is recording and talking all sweet tone to change the narrative. I really cannot understand how hitting record even crosses someone\u2019s mind. The don\u2019t mess with me thing makes this more likely, that she is a serial pain who complains a lot. Those are generally the people that jump to hitting record.", "This sounds like the type of school that would make a bullied kid apologise to the bully \"just to smooth things over\"\n\nNot saying that's what they do, as we have zero info - just that's the vibe I get, it wouldn't surprise me.", "How is this so far down.  OP doesn't seem to have taken any measures to inform the administration of the teacher holding up the line.  She didn't try talking to the teacher outside of drop-off hours.  She knows this is an ongoing problem and has made no adjustments to her own routine to deal with it.  And then she's surprised when the teacher and parent don't take well to her going against protocol to scold them?  Nah, she lost the high ground when she decided confrontation was the way to go.", "This. NTA and former teacher here? Time to go to the administration with the recording. Show your documentation. They need to do something about this and lying about you should backfire because this both endangers the students and wasted your time. How many parents are in danger of losing their jobs over this person?", "Do it OP.\n\nWatch them try to get out of a situation they themselves caused.", "I love it when someone's being snarky and trying to correct someone, but they're actually the ones that are wrong.", ">She said that someone said that they recorded me doing so. I told her not to play games with me because she'll lose. Because guess what? **I recorded it too.**\n\nMaybe do a better job reading before trying to correct others.", "School Board is the way!", "Admin throws good, dedicated teachers under the bus and defends the bad ones cuz the good ones can handle it and won't leave while the bad ones cause legal liability they deny deny deny.", "No mercy.", "OP is a badass tho. That was a pro move recording the conversation. I guess we can all learn from this too, if we're gonna be putting ourselves in a hostile situation we have to keep the recorder app on.", "No, I saw that, but I read it differently, that the op is saying to the vp that they recorded it. They never mentioned recording while describing the incident.", "I mean if you're not sure you can certainly ask OP to clarify, it's certainly possible but you'd need to ask. But the other poster commented multiple times throughout this post as though OP said nothing about recording them, which is just incorrect.", "Just going to pop my phone into a VHS to play the video lol", "Honestly I was being lazy and was hoping a helpful Redditor would come along and link a comment where the op said one way or the other. But i based my judgement on the fact that op got out of their car to start something instead of contacting the school to say the one teacher always had traffic backed up due to excessive socializing as it is a reoccurring thing. I\u2019ve lost interest in if there is actually a recording or not.", "Teehee! I still have one, tbh! My daughter (now 27) loved that thing, I can't get rid of it.", "If the car door was open and Op was supposedly \"yelling\" you'd might be able to hear yelling/swearing."]}
