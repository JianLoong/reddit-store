How much do you take seriously and how much do you take with a grain of salt?\n\nI think the VP is trying to be a good boss/ administrator, and was going off a somewhat exaggerated account she was told by one of her employees, or possibly another parent from the line who saw and recorded things, but wasn't close enough to hear anything. \n\nI'm going to say either you nor the VP are assholes, though the teacher and parent holding up traffic were, especially if they slanted this incident to the VP to get her in their corner.\n\nNAH", "Somebody is lying.\n\nIf I were OP, I'd be sending a letter re: OP needing a written apology for lies, along with identification of whomever said there was cursing, including an update on whatever disciplinary action is levied, or you would need to seek legal counsel since an employee of the school district lied about an interaction with you.", "I\u2019d file a formal complaint for creating an unsafe situation and for fabricating facts and creating a hostile environment with the video and emails as reference. Maybe even suggesting worry about retaliation against your child.", "I would report the VP to the school district. Hopefully you didn't delete the email. \n\nMy guess is the VP and the teacher in question are good friends.", "OP, I would call and ask to talk to the principal. I would then explain to him or her what's been going on and what happened after. Then, I would ask that the principal handle them. If he or she can't, I would talk to the superintendent. It doesn't have to be a HUGE deal, but they certainly can't act like you were the problem in this situation or demand an apology.", "You make a great point and I\u2019m so sorry to do this but it\u2019s \u201cthey\u2019re\u201d not \u201ctheir\u201d", "Are you really surprised? Seems par for the course. \"My guy is innocent until proven guilty no matter what they accuse you of\"", "OMG we have a local \"Drop-off Line Shamers\" Facebook page in my county, this would be a solid week of entertainment for them.", "Did none of the other parents complain? Or was the back of the line so far away they couldn't see what the hold-up was?", "Idk, what is the appropriate response to someone who lies to your face?", ">However, someone who records themselves politely asking how long something will take, and uses the phrase \"don't play games with me because you'll lose?\" You sound like a piece of work.\n\nShe sounds like someone who deals with bs, or even microaggressions ( maybe their whole lives) For all we know, could be having problems with that vice principal or school. Heck, mom could be a woman of color who deals with people quick to lie or throw them under the bus when they're the ones in the wrong. I could easily see this being a story someone in my family told, and would definitely get it.", "Since it's become a regular issue, I think deciding to record the interaction makes more sense. But if this was a first time thing and they recorded it...yeah, that'd be weird.", "Agreed. I said NTA but I also think it\u2019s questionable that she had prepared to record herself approaching this woman about timeliness. That definitely makes me wonder if OP has a history of this type of confrontational behavior..", "Dashcam.", "I think the opposite is true. Are you more likely to record a conversation A) where you expect to remain calm but know the other person might cop an attitude or B) where you\u2019re planning to be an aggressive AH.\n\nMaybe she recorded the conversation because she knew the teacher or parent might get pissy.\n\nOP may be a bit abrasive, but not likable? Depends on your perspective. She might not be all flowers and sunshine, but I\u2019m guessing the other parents stuck in traffic like her just fine.", "Completely agree here. People are acting like this teacher is an evil person who doesn\u2019t take their job seriously when the situation could have been handled so much easier and with less drama by OP.", "> You started this mess unnecessarily\n\nSo, what, OP's just supposed to wait for 30 minutes while the teacher chats with parents?", "This is the way", "Or it is the VP ..", "Ooh really?? My husband would love that. He loses his mind when people hold up the drop off line. Although our school is much better this year. They have multiple staff members out there directing it", "Probably too scard to complain because of this exact situation.", "If she has a dash cam it wouldn't have captured the exchange because there were 3 cars in front of her", "Maybe I should use more \"in my opinion,\" I get that other people might not see it my way \n\n\nTo me, it's fair to be angry, but using that phrase comes off as very holier than thou, \"you know I'm better than you, right?\" mentality. \n\n\nHonestly if OP said they responded with something like \"you're a fucking liar, I also have video proof\" I'd probably cheer them on. Which is a weird distinction I maybe, I dunno.", "Sweep the legs, obviously", "I thought dashcam.", "That may be but it's been my experience that when a person is asked to stop doing something they think is fine the reaction is often unpleasant. People are just incapable of saying 'oh, sorry' and stopping the offending behavior. Usually there's angry pushback.\n\nIMHO, anyone who is willing to stand there and yammer and cause a line of cars to back up when there's kids who need to get inside and parents who need to get to work isn't concerned with anyone but themselves. That sort doesn't react well to correction.\n\nI'd have let her talk, filmed her and the line of cars behind for a few Fridays and sent that to the admin.", "Or OP has a dash cam and it recorded it.", "But she was three cars back", "call their bluff on this.  submit your video and ask for theirs.  you were accused of some pretty gross shit.", "Yup, I spent many years in school car loops as a parent and a nanny, where staff opens the vehicle door so kids are safely escorted out of vehicle and moved along towards the building. \nIt\u2019s definitely no fun for most adults, parents and staff alike. But to talk and talk, holding up the line, oh jeez\u2019us that\u2019s the worst. I can feel my blood pressure going up just remembering how much of my life I flushed away waiting in car loops=big Ugh. N.T.A. Keep all records of communications and do not apologize until your 100% satisfied with how you have been treated.", "Bots getting bold stealing comments from the OP lol.", "My wife teaches and also complains a lot.  I think it\u2019s just an industry thing.", "YMMV. I had a high schooler throw a tantrum in one of my classes, and it got pretty ugly. After it became clear that the student was at fault and I wasn\u2019t, admin removed the student not just from my class but also from the class of a teacher down the hall so that we wouldn\u2019t cross paths anymore.", "I think it's a trope at this point.", "Do you also get suspicious about people that get car insurance because you think they're up to something, otherwise they wouldn't need insurance, they'd just not get into accidents in the first place? Are people who benefit from having had car insurance \"being lucky\" and you wouldn't \"give them credit\" for being insured?\n\nI think it is strongly suggested that they didn't make a big show of recording specifically because if the other person is clearly filming you, you probably don't lie and say the incident was recorded (which either the teacher or parent did). You probably only lie and say you recorded it when you think the other party didn't. So that suggests the recording was running, but not blatantly in people's faces.", "I think you need to realise the world has changed and videotaping encounters is actually an extremely wise thing to do, and becoming more and more common. To judge someone as obnoxious simply for wanting proof when they are confronting another person just proves how stupid you are", "Can't you adjust or move some of them?", "how i interpreted that was \n\n\"you don't want to go with that lie because I have proof\"..\n\nnot sure how that phrase sounds like he's saying he's better than them", "You\u2019re right. That is a weird distinction.", ">\"you know I'm better than you, right?\"\n\nIf one side is lying to your face in an attempt to make you the bad guy of the story, I do in fact believe you *are* better than them.", "ah! useful to know :D", "Really smart move now everyone knows more or less where OP lives.", "I know right! This is the second one I caught today that stole from the OP.", "Stupid lie too. Simple bluff to call.", "My experience is that the administration lies a lot. They are all misunderstandings.", "Lying about something easily verifiable is stupid. That\u2019s what I tell my supervisor when she implies I\u2019m lying about my hours.", "For real.", "Absolutely."]}
