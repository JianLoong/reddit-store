Funny how they changed their tune because you actually recorded it. What would irk me the most about this is that the VP was ready to lie and let the ACTUAL unsafe situation continue. Like really? Lying about yelling, lying about cursing, and lying about recording. And then claiming you\u2019re creating an unsafe situation? Neither of these people should be in charge of children.", "NTA\n\nI'm kinda surprised the admin sided with the teacher and is going so far as to demand an apology. I guess their in the same work ~~clich\u00e9~~ clique or something.", "NTA\n\nLmao, send your recording if you must, but the butthurt teacher and whoever lied about having a recording of you cursing and yelling absolutely deserve to get embarrassed.", "NTA. I hate audacious liars.", "NTA. I am very unclear about what exactly you are meant to apologise for though. And why you would consider it.", "NTA. It sounds like that teacher does not take her job seriously, and getting out of your vehicle is not unsafe when the cars aren't moving BECAUSE THEY WERE STOPPING THEM WITH THEIR CHATTING.", "NTA, and a resounding one at that. \n\nUse that recording and destroy them. Apologise to no one. You were not in the wrong at all here. \n\nTell that VP to produce her alleged recording that she claims someone made, and if she doesn't, escalate the situation. Petty people in small positions of what they think is power. They wield it badly. \n\nAlso, you were totally justified in asking them to chat another time, this is a drop-off, not a social situation.", "NTA people need to get to work, they were holding up the line", "NTA a singular rotten apple should be eliminated from society", "NTA and continue to record. Bring the issue to the superintendent if you need to. Maybe even the PTA moms would be up in arms... they all have to wait in line too!", "NTA. Bad enough that they're inconveniencing everyone (not just parents and students, but presumably other drivers who use the road the line extends into), but to lie about it as well? That's over the line. Stand your ground.", "Ask for a meeting between you, the principal, and the teacher\n\nBring an Ipad or a Laptop so you can all watch the video\n\nThen ask the teacher to explain why she lied about the interaction and whether or not the principal is going to reprimand the teacher for lying\n\nNTA", "NTA. They don\u2019t deserve an apology especially after lying about what happened.", "I wouldn't apologize at all and tell the VP that you want to meet with her and the principal and the lies that were told about you were not acceptable and you are expecting a formal apology from the school for accusing you of these falsehoods.  NTA", "Time is money. You stood your ground, nothing wrong with it. Definitely NTA.", "She wasn't *wrong,* she purposely *lied* to try and get you in hot water. I see nothing here to apologize for at all.\n\n\nJust going purely off the post, I'd say NTA.\n\n\n*However,* someone who records themselves politely asking how long something will take, and uses the phrase \"don't play games with me because you'll lose?\" You sound like a piece of work. I won't consider that inference into judgement (I really don't like when people do that here) so I'm still saying NTA, but boy howdy you don't come off as a likeable person.", "NTA. \"I will not apologize for stating they were creating traffic because the teacher likes to chat. I do expect this not to happen again. I would also like an apology for the obvious lie about me yelling at staff.\"", "NTA - I would go over the VPs head with the recording and the emails", "NTA. I would contact the board. If they make a huge deal, start a legal case. Save those messages.", "NTA- funny how the narrative changed once you had proof. I don\u2019t even see a reason to have you apologize. If anything, the irresponsible teacher should be apologizing to all the parents that probably share the same sentiment about traffic on her watch.", "Even asking you to apologize is outside the scope of duties of a principal. Find in her job description where it says\u201dhave parents apologize to teachers.\u201d Garuntee its not there.", "NTA, but I do think it could have been handled better by elevating your concerns with this teacher either directly in a calmer manner or by speaking with administration, although the way the VP handled the situation doesn't give me tremendous confidence.\n\nUltimately your approach seems to have escalated the situation more than it should have been.
