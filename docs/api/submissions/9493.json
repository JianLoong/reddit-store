I get that he is going through alot but this reeks of attention getting behavior at your son's expense. I'd be upset too.", "NTA it\u2019s kinda weird of him. I think it\u2019s fair to bring up ur concerns and try to talk him out of it but if he really feels like it fits him at some point you just need to accept it.\n\nAlso it\u2019s interesting how so many transmasc people choose the name Finn haha", "NTA. But be prepared to your brother choosing it just because he\u2019s not supposed to. Forbidden things are so much better.

Maybe that\u2019ll help.", "I understand that your identity is important, I've tried very hard to support you and your feelings. Can you try to understand mine?

There are many other names he could choose from and he is being selfish by not consider your sons name and your feelings.", "NTA but honestly, he's 14 and has transphobic parents. Just let him use the name for the two weeks, he probably really relies on your support.", "NTA. You sound like a good sibling, and his choice to choose something so similar to your son's name is weird.", "NTA, but I wouldn't push it any further. You pointed out that it's similar to your son's and that is strange and, to me, seems attention-seeking of your brother. However, I would leave it at that. It is their choice.", "NTA. If I had a son named Finley and my brother wanted to name his kid Finn it would be weird. So it\u2019s also weird in this situation. Is he possibly wanting to use the name bc he looks up to you?

Lots of trans people go through several names before something sounds right. \n\nDon't listen to the people saying it's about attention, that's a really transphobic idea and it'll be bad if you say that to your brother.\n\nJust be there and talk through it patiently.

Please, Peter Junior, pass the salt to Peter Petersson, and then go to Middle Peter to help play with baby Pete. \nWe still managed somehow. \nAs for me- NAH, you can express your concern, but really- even if your brother decides on this name, everything will be OK.", "NTA You say that your brother keeps changing his name? It sounds to me as though he's still searching for his identity. Finn (as opposed to Finlay/Findlay/Finley) is a fairly gender neutral name. I wonder whether this is why he's opted for Finn?  \n\n\nhttps://nameberry.com/babyname/finn/girl  \n\n\nYou're stuck between a rock and a hard place here. I'm guessing that if you were to ask him, he might mistakenly think that you weren't supporting his masculine ID. I have to admit that - given all the name changes - I'm wondering whether your brother is edging towards being Non-Binary. (If I'm causing offence by asking this, then I apologise. I'm a Boomer, but I'm trying to get it right.)  \n\n\nIn your place, I'd be taken aback by the appropriation of your son's name, but given that your brother keeps changing his mind, I think I'd just leave him be and wait for the next name change. You're a good sibling. It seems to me that - like most young people, your brother is trying to find the best fit for himself.  \n\n\nFrom a practical point of view, the first time that someone shouts 'Finn' and both your brother and your son answer, I think that your brother will see that he's causing confusion by sharing a name with his nephew.", "NTA - this is lame. There are literally millions of names available and to go for your 4 yr old son's nickname is bizarre.\n\nLike if your bro wants acceptance from the fam then maybe not name yourself after the actual little boy in the family. It's bizarre.  Hopefully this was another tryout name and there will be a new name coming up soon as there has been in the past.", "NTA.  Tell him everyone will call him FN-2187 though.", "NTA that is creepy of him.", "NAH So this can sound strange but finn is a super common trans guy name so I do not see a big problem with him chosing it", "NTA", "Eh, Nah to possibly yta? It's not that big of a deal, I'm transmasc and go by Elijah, and I have like, 3 other cousins all with the same name lmao. Before going by that I shared a name with my late grandmother, and my mother, step sister, and late aunt all share a name. It's not that weird imo", "Family members having similar names or even same names aint really that big of a deal. My son is named after my dad. My mum has similar name to my name. Uncle n grandad share similar name too. As does my brother and other uncle have similar names. Never confused any of us growing up especially as we'd all have different nicknames within the family. I'd say NAH here. Whilst ur valid in your feelings hes also allowed to pick his own name and he probably ended up decided on that as it was a name connected to his supportive sibling that he looks up to.", "NTA when people have the same name in a family it is usually to honor that family member. The name isn\u2019t chosen because it\u2019s common or cool. I\u2019m sure you put a lot of thought into your son\u2019s name and it probably feels like your brother is scrolling through to see what fits best without giving it much thought. If he is that fickle about his name, I can only imagine the roller coaster of gender identity. I would sit on this topic a bit. Your son would call him \u201cUncle\u201d anyway, so there isn\u2019t confusion within your immediate family. Maybe there is \u201cBig Finn\u201d and \u201cLittle Finn.\u201d\n\nHaving teens myself and teaching teens and young adults, I\u2019ve seen several transition socially, several try it out superficially because their peer group is doing it, a few who decide it\u2019s not for them after experimenting, a few who begin hormones, and a few who decide they prefer to be non-binary even after declaring a gender socially. I see this flip flopping all the way  through college as they are still understanding themselves. Give him space. \n\nMy guess is that by the time your brother decides to make his new name concrete and change it legally, it will be a non-issue for you. If he changes his name again later, you will be glad you didn\u2019t make a bigger fuss. If he is doing this for attention, it\u2019s still better to wait and not give it negative attention.\n\nNo matter what he needs therapy to deal with what is going on with your parents, and he may find on his own that a completely different name is best for him.\n\n**edit to add that I don\u2019t think him choosing the same name is weird, but I get where OP is coming from and why it feels weird for OP.", "It's a name. It's the noise you make when you want someone's attention. calm down", "Hi, trans guy here. And ESH. Finn is an incredibly popular name, and it's not wrong to have two (or more) people in the same family with the same name. (I've got three cousins named Michael and multiple Sunny's and Sonny's.

You should really ask yourself what truly bothers you there.", "YTA please chill out, you are getting upset with a 14 year old for choosing a name similar to a 4 year old- the worst that will happen is they will start calling themselves the Finn-team and do a stupid pose or something.

Picking the name Finn is kinda weird, but hes also a 14 yo kid whose probably gonna do more exploring in the name department. Give him time, he might change  his mind or you may get used to Finn.", "YTA. There are several people in my family with the same name. It\u2019s no big deal at all. A few people might turn around when you shout out a name but it\u2019s easy to work out who they are talking to. \n\nWhy not be curious about what the name Finn means to him? It clearly has a strong meaning to him, maybe something to do with feeling loved and accepted by you and your son when he\u2019s been rejected by the people who are meant to love him unconditionally. Maybe he\u2019s wishing you were his mum. Him having the name Finn doesn\u2019t take away anything from your son, rather it could make it more special. Just change how you look at it.", "YTA. I feel like you're making a bigger issue out of this than what's needed.  People aren't going to be confused.  There are tons of family members in the world that have the same name and they don't get confused.", "YTA because while I get where you're coming from I feel like it's not as big a deal as you make it out to be. I don't think an uncle having the same name as your son is weird, it just happens sometimes. And I doubt your son would be confused, simply because family always call him Finley and your brother Finn and *if* your son's friends who call your son Finn ever had anything to do with your brother (which I kinda doubt), he'd probably be referred to as \"uncle Finn\". It's not an issue if you think about it realistically. Finn is a really common name, especially for trans guys so it's not like he chose a super rare name that is similar to your son's name on purpose", "I get the concern for your son since he is so young, but it isn't that serious. People have the same name, y'all could even create a nickname together for son to use while he gets a better understanding. You went straight into trying to tell him he was wrong instead of understanding why he chose it. YTA", "YTA.
