The name isn\u2019t chosen because it\u2019s common or cool. I\u2019m sure you put a lot of thought into your son\u2019s name and it probably feels like your brother is scrolling through to see what fits best without giving it much thought. If he is that fickle about his name, I can only imagine the roller coaster of gender identity. I would sit on this topic a bit. Your son would call him \u201cUncle\u201d anyway, so there isn\u2019t confusion within your immediate family. Maybe there is \u201cBig Finn\u201d and \u201cLittle Finn.\u201d\n\nHaving teens myself and teaching teens and young adults, I\u2019ve seen several transition socially, several try it out superficially because their peer group is doing it, a few who decide it\u2019s not for them after experimenting, a few who begin hormones, and a few who decide they prefer to be non-binary even after declaring a gender socially. I see this flip flopping all the way  through college as they are still understanding themselves. Give him space. \n\nMy guess is that by the time your brother decides to make his new name concrete and change it legally, it will be a non-issue for you. If he changes his name again later, you will be glad you didn\u2019t make a bigger fuss. If he is doing this for attention, it\u2019s still better to wait and not give it negative attention.\n\nNo matter what he needs therapy to deal with what is going on with your parents, and he may find on his own that a completely different name is best for him.\n\n**edit to add that I don\u2019t think him choosing the same name is weird, but I get where OP is coming from and why it feels weird for OP.", "It's a name.

A few people might turn around when you shout out a name but it\u2019s easy to work out who they are talking to. \n\nWhy not be curious about what the name Finn means to him? It clearly has a strong meaning to him, maybe something to do with feeling loved and accepted by you and your son when he\u2019s been rejected by the people who are meant to love him unconditionally.

And I doubt your son would be confused, simply because family always call him Finley and your brother Finn and *if* your son's friends who call your son Finn ever had anything to do with your brother (which I kinda doubt), he'd probably be referred to as \"uncle Finn\".

This is doubly so for queer kids who tend to end up in circles with other queer kids/young queer adults who are trapped in immaturity cycles because what little safe spaces they have are the only places they can be, well, annoying kids. Majority cis straight people got to have that cringe age and grow out of it naturally without their parents telling them they\u2019re disgusting aberrations on the road to hell just for being different. Tons of queer kids don\u2019t have that space, that breathing room, and when you\u2019re already hyper scrutinized for being queer, your naturally annoying teenageness is magnified. \n\nYou have less of an excuse but this is common - lots of parents get weirdly possessive about frankly dirt common baby names.

Having two people with the same name isn't that confusing once you get used to it.\n\nAlso, based on what you've said, you have no reason to assume that your brother is trying to \"steal\" your kid's name. A lot of the trans people I know put a fair amount of thought into picking their names, so it's quite possible that \"Finn\" has real significance for him.\n\nIt might be worth reaching out to your brother to apologize and ask him why he picked the name he did. Even if \"Finn\" doesn't stick, he will remember the time he told you about a chosen name and you didn't react well.", "Your best bet is to be excited thst he is naming himself after your little one, how excited little Finn will be that big Finn chose his name!  Tell him so, really happy and excited.  And if the name sticks, it sticks.  Deal with it.  But always insist it\u2019s after your son, because, TBH, it really is.", "NTA. It\u2019s the same name as your son. Why would he choose his nephew\u2019s name as his own? Generally names are inherited from predecessors when choosing family names, not the other way around.", "NTA sorry but people who do this are freaking weirdos to me.", "NTA", "NTA. As a trans guy, this is really weird of your brother to do. I would never imagine choosing a name that's basically the same as a close relative's. I really liked a certain name, but it was the same name as my cousin who died, so I obviously didn't use it because that's disrespectful AF--even if my cousin hadn't been dead. It's blatant disrespect to choose a name so close to a relative's name. There are so many names out there your brother could go with, so why pick one of the very few names that's going to make the whole situation uncomfortable?", "He is 14, wise choice on the silence. I suggest inviting him over to your house for a day of \u201cNot you, the other Finn.\u201d Every time someone says Finn.\n\nI think he might begin to see the problem.", "Nta. I'm a trans woman myself, when I was choosing what I was going to call myself a lot of things factored in. This was definitely something I was trying to avoid. I have no immediate relatives that have my name at least. Maybe you could have been a little more subtle about it but I don't think you're wrong in that being an upsetting situation. I think you definitely did what you could and your best bet would probably be to move forward. If you wanna truly be there for them, offer help! :) You sound like an amazing brother!", "Also a trans person and agreed. Those two names are too close for me. However, I suppose there are cultures and families that do name younger relatives after living relatives so if he sticks with the name it can pass as that. \n\nBut I also want to say that trans people can go through a LOT of names trying to establish what works for their identity. And at least in my observation, this is even more true for trans teenagers, as their identities shift around, they are figuring themselves out, and their social networks are really small and usually limited to family and friends at school. Their range of names are often limited to their rather immediate vicinity (and also whatever name is trending in their irl or online trans community). I\u2019d be willing to bet he will change it again.", "also, people outside the family already do call Finley \"Finn\" so the brother is stealing his nephew's name. I think it's different to name yourself after a grandparent or other elder relative, but a little kid it just seems weird to me.", ">\tFinley is only 4 he may decide that Finn is how he would like to be addressed.\n\nSo? Then there are two. Finley needs to get used to that, will happen in school etc. all the time.\n\n>\tlike makes it seem like you named the kid after him.\n\nAnd that would be a problem why?\n\nYTA", "Why is this comment downvoted so much. People are weird.", "Exactly. I landed on my name after a lot of consideration and I\u2019m still not 100% sure (do wish I could change my Reddit name tho). It\u2019s weird, but less so for a 14 year old. Maybe he can try it on, but I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019ll come up with something more personal later on.", "Oh yeah, as a genderqueer. And he shares my birthday :3", "The brother is 14???", ">\"but it's a completely different name, I don't go by Finley I go by Finn and Finley never gets called Finn\"\n\nIt's a point towards Finn saying that his name and Finley are different and they don't even call him Finn.  It's my opinion that it's weird to name yourself after your nephew. Btw I didn't ask if I was an asshole.", "My grandparents were from Quebec and everyone was Joseph or Marie for their first name.
