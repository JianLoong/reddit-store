Awful that your parents allowed that to happen.", "NTA. You need to have some perspective though. Alzheimer's is a continuum and most probably your \"GMA\" (sic) was exhibiting signs way before the actual diagnosis. Clearly \"GMA\" was never in her right mind when she was treating you poorly.

It is obviously understandable that she was not a good person to you and for you to have such a person around in those years was painful and so your feelings are totally understandable.", "I think that the way she treated you is horrible and unforgivable.
