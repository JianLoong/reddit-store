It wasn\u2019t until high school where I began to notice her real hatred towards me. She would always blame things my sisters did on me. While I was at school she would go through my stuff and deny it. When I would stay late at school doing hw because I hated being home, she would tell my parents I was messing with boys. She always tried to get me in trouble. My Parents would tell me to pay her no mind. It became so bad that my godparents offered me a room at their house. \n\nIn college, I began to date someone. My GMA hated seeing me happy that she would talk shit about me to him when he was over. I felt so embarrassed I did not want to bring him around anymore. When I stopped bringing him, she called my mom\u2019s brother,her son, and told him I was dating a married man. There was no truth to her statement. It caused family drama because my GMA denied telling my uncle that lie. She  then chose to move out the day I confronted her about her lie. She said that I hated her and she could not bare live in the same house if I treated her that way. That day I began to hate her. \n\nFast forward to today, she has Alzheimer\u2019s and always tells me she loves me. She caused me so much trauma that i ignore her.

On the other hand, telling someone \"I'll be happy when your mom dies\" is a really mean thing to say to that person.  My mom is not a pleasant person, but she's been a good mom to me.  If one of the people she is regularly unpleasant to told me that they would be happy if she died...I would feel awful....and it isn't my fault that she is unpleasant to others.  It would have been best for you simply to say that grandma has always made you feel bad about yourself and treated you so poorly that you can't help but feel resentment and that you hope that your mom can understand your feelings.", "ESH your mom should be understanding of your feelings and get over it, but you went too far. you gotta understand that\u2019s the woman who birthed and raised her so she sees her differently than just a grandma. yeah she sucks but keep it to yourself", "YTA-  I understand your feelings and they are valid.  But your mom loves her mother and that is such a harsh thing to say to a person who loves someone that is dying.  Do you love your mother? If you do you should apologize.

I did not tell my mom i hope my GMA would died. She had heard my GMA tell me she loves me and i did not respond. My mother told me privately that i should no longer resent my GMA because If she died I would regret not saying I love you back. I do believe maybe stating I would be relived and maybe happy was insensitive. I think I was just frustrated that she was dismissive towards my trauma.", "I actually don't agree with you.

Then its okay to wish someone dead when they\u2019re mean to you.  I had a bully when I was a kid.  An older, bigger kid who used to pick on me and beat me up.

The mum never stepped in and tried to stop her, no she brought the abuse into her home and let it continue. Its a parents job to prevent abuse, bullying and bad treatment towards their children. The mum is one part of creating a Situation, the grandma is the other."]}
