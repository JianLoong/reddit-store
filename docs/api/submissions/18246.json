If they have no pets/children go round and ask if anyone else can smell that weird smell? Human nature being what it is, someone will smell your imaginary smell.\n\nHowever, as much as I like the petty I would suggest D.\n\nD) sit down just you and your brother, apologies for excluding him and then explain how insulting and awful what his wife does is and how it ruins events you host, you just want a relaxed and fun day with family and she has you on edge and upset constantly.

This is a trash take.  Be a disrespectful AH, get treated like one.", "No it is not smiling and bearing it, it is having a grown up, heartfelt conversation with your brother and SIL and trying to work it out. Being passive aggressive and lying is not the way.", "THIS. people if youre going to make a judgment can you please go through the trouble of attempting to understand the content you are reading before moving on?\n\nit comes of that you were assuming that since you saw the word bitch within the word used (bitchING) that they are the AH which is only because of your lack of reading and comprehending.", "I agree that the lying was a misstep, albeit a misguided one rather than a malicious one. But given that the SIL's response to hearing from the brother that \"Hey, OP doesn't want you at her house because you do nothing but complain\" was \"Fuck you, your husband sucks at BBQing anyway so you're doing me a favor!\" combined with her reaction to a hurt 2 year old on a previous occasion being \"Take that brat inside.\" I don't think it would have accomplished anything? Hell, the brother's response to it was \"Yeah, she's a lot but...suck it up.\" so he likely wouldn't have been helpful either.\n\nSometimes people have just earned the middle finger and nothing else."]}
