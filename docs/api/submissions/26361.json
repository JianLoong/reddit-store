They do sound like they need another perspective.", "NAH. It does sound like she should probably have some type of therapy. It doesn't seem that you were overly rude or shouted at her, but do you think there's anything in the way you said it that could have come off as overly blunt and rude? There's a difference between say, \"I'm worried about you, and I think you should see someone about this,\" and \"There's something wrong with you and you have a mental illness.\" for example. If it's the latter, than yeah it could still be a bit tactless but not enough to peg you as TA.", "NTA, paranormal/conspiracy theories hit this weird speculative itch people can get absorbed with if they suffer a break from reality. Some people genuinely aren't lucid enough or wired right to remember things aren't real just because someone imagines or says them, or it's fun enough to think about that they lose track of it being for entertainment. I don't think this counts as mentally ill, but maybe gullible.", "I\u2019m not sure how to address this one without more context. Did you say it insultingly or were you seriously concerned? I would find it hard to let a friend just believe that about them being real. But that part may not be the same thing as getting emotionally attached to a character and being sad when they die. I tear up myself if I really liked how they were written. But if she\u2019s being full on depressed about it for multiple days that\u2019s not healthy.", "NTA - Sometimes you have to tell your friends something they don't want to hear.", "NTA, your friend would need help", "YTA. You're not wrong, but this isn't useful. All it does is make people dig in their heels.", "It\u2019s not necessarily mental illness persay.

It might make them a little eccentric,  but not mentally ill.", "It sounds like she mostly has an overactive imagination, as long as this doesn't impact her actual day to day life. If it does, she's going to need some sort of help. I don't really have a judgment. Sorry.", "YTA for pushing this. If you were genuinely concerned, you can bring it up once. But you can't keep pushing it. That's not productive or healthy. It also doesn't sound like this is really harming her in any real way.", "YTA..1. This reads like you want a bunch of strangers to tell you that your friend is mentally ill 2. Your friend watching movie or reads a book that involves a bunch of innocent characters dying and talking about it and being sad about those characters dying.. that's what we call empathy. It's just for fictional characters. \nI remember when the dino died in Jurassic world 2, we all were crying. And yes, if that same movie played today, I would still cry and probably would for days. Why? Because those sad scenes play over and over in my mind for days, this is actually a trauma response on my part.  Your friend may have something similar going on (certain scenes just repeat over and over) . But saying she's mentally ill is how you get shut out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When David Icke developed his paranoid schizophrenic delusions, he got the system of the reptilian conspiracy from the TV drama *V*, which had just come out, and he's still caught up in it.  You can't fix schizophrenia by arguing against delusional content - the physiological process that makes people adopt the delusions is what matters.  That needs risperidone, not reasoning.", "Yeah I spoke to her about it and she explained that whenever there's a movie and fictional characters die, somewhere in another universe that really happened and that's what she's sad over.", "I said I was concerned for her wellbeing, I didn't mean it in an insulting way.", "And she was full on depressed for days over this horror movie she saw where a family died in the end.

Movies are made to create emotions in us. I still can't think of \"Me before you\" without tearing up.

People get extremely attached and emotionally connected to fiction. That's not really a bizarre thing. And it's her choice if she doesn't see this as a problem. You can't push and force her to.", "I'm genuinely concerned for her.", "She actually believes that when characters die in movies/books/media somewhere in another universe that actually happened. So, she mourns them in the exact same way you'd mourn a person's death you read about in a newspaper.", "> Many people are genuinely upset when a fictional character dies.\n\nI understand this, but she takes it too far since she actually believes these characters really existed and died.", "What movie is that I want to watch it", "Right, and I think we can agree that that isn't true. However her being sad over a fictional character (even one she believes is real) dying isn't going to hurt her and it's not a mental illness. Have you truly never been gutted when a TV show or movie kills off your favorite character? Never shed a tear during Homeward Bound when Shadow comes up over the hill and says \"Peter\"? I don't think her believing that a character is real is that relevent. She's sad because someone (in a movie or \"real life\" to her) died. That emotion is real and I think most people have felt that emotion for a fictional character and it's not dangerous or going to hurt her.", "Again, you can't make her see this as a problem if she doesn't.

One night a missile lands in their yard leaving a crater. After a while, radiation from the missile affects their minds causing them to go into a trance and hallucinate, or go insane. Some of the family members start to mutate and after a while the radiation killed all of them.
