You can\u2019t *make* these kids do anything. Dance is a recreational activity they are paying for and if they would rather attend homecoming that\u2019s their choice. \n\nI also think you\u2019re doing a disservice to your customers by not reevaluating the schedule and plan knowing multiple customers now have a conflict.", "YTA So what you are gonna force them to do it, dance is meant to be fun and if you are forcing them it is gonna come out in the performance and look bad.", "INFO: did you check the school calendar before scheduling?", "Info: Who benefits from this dance experience? Are these kids performing or watching? What would the \"cost\" be to 1) change the date, 2) excuse those who would choose HC over dance, 3) cancel? And, who, ultimately, will pay those costs?  What is the remarkable \"once in a lifetime\" opportunity these kids are willing to give up for HC? \n\nYou need to remember to keep your studio in perspective to the relevance to the lives of the community you serve. They are kids, even if they aren't seniors, it's still a momentous occasion for them. They only get to be kids once.", "Yes, YTA\n\nA social event like homecoming is important to highschool students. \n\n\u201cOnce in a lifetime kinda deal\u201d lol. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s more important to you than it is to them.  Homecoming actually is a once in a lifetime deal - as it only happens while they are in highschool.  \n\nThey can dance at silly dance studio performances any other year of their life. \n\nI\u2019m sure your business is at least partially reliant on word of mouth and public opinion effects your signups each year.  You want to gain the reputation of miserable controlling dance studio? Go for it \n\nYour defence is they signed a contract. What, are you going to sue children for not dancing ?", "YTA\n\nYou don't get to decide which \"once in a lifetime\" event is more important to them.

What are you going to do? Sue them?", "YTA. You should have checked the school schedule.", "If you set it up every summer how is it a once in a lifetime thing? Yta.  Move it to spring or schedule for later in the fall.", "INFO do these kids pay to do your dance recitals or do you pay them to do these things?", "So\u2026 is it that you are going to kick them out of your dance studio? Or just not refund their fees to join your competition? \n\nDancing is a really serious commitment, and I understand why you wanted their commitment for this - but did you put such heavy commitment clauses in because you knew this was ball season and you risked losing many to their dances/balls? Or was it just poor planning on your part that you put your competition in the middle of ball season when all the kids want to go to their school dances?   \n\n\nAre you the AH? Yeah, possibly. If you are aggressively pursuing them about their commitments and contracts and making their ability to participate in future events with your studio tenuous (which they\u2019ve contributed to financially and with hours of sweat equity) \u2026 then YTA.", "Yes. YTA", "I was the student in this situation many years ago. \n\nPerformance scheduled for homecoming. \n\nWe got onto stage, every single one of us shot double birds at the audience,  refused to dance, and walked off stage, and quit dance immediately.  \n\nThat was 15 years ago and students today are way more outspoken and stand up for themselves. Do with that information what you will.", "INFO: What are the consequences of missing the performance?", "INFO: What's the main reason you are setting the hard-line? Is it a situation where the rest of the dancers can't participate if the others don't show? Are parents trying to get out of paying/get refunds on money that went to the performance? \n\nWhy is it a once in a lifetime opportunity? Did you arrange for celebrities or scouts to come?", "What exactly can you do if they don't show? They'll find other dance studios.", "YTA it\u2019s pretty easy to look up your local schools football schedules in the summer, or call the athletic departments to see what month homecoming is scheduled. This sounds like a mistake and poor planning on your part. If you have high school aged dancers plan your recital for a different month. It\u2019s not up to you to decide what is most important to them. A contract signed with a minor child means nothing. If the venue is booked & you can\u2019t move the date, move the performance time to the early afternoon so there isn\u2019t a conflict. If word gets out how inflexible &  uncaring your studio is you are going to lose a lot of business.", "NTA\n\nShit happens & people have to make choices in life when there\u2019s a scheduling conflict.\n\nNot certain if it\u2019s a good business decision. If it\u2019s possible to reschedule the recital that\u2019s probably the path I would take. At the very least, you should try to look like you are actively trying to help & compromise.", "NTA since this was set up well in advance and the conflict is unintentional.  That said, it would be a good business decision to look into rescheduling if OP wants to keep these clients and get potential good references.  Or they at least calmly and professionally explain why that isn't possible and at minimum pretend to understand the perspective of the students.\n\nGenerally speaking though I do get OP's position refarding the contractual commitment of all involved.  Also, once you're out of high-school these dime a dozen dances really aren't as significant as they seem at the time.  Don't want to diminish or invalidate the feelings of the students, but grand scheme of life the performance sounds like it is a potentially more meaningful event.", "NTA\n\nI know all about these dance performances. This is a huge deal for your studio and the kids. The logistics behind these types of performances can be tremendous. You did everything right from a business perspective.\n\nWhat are you are getting now is the repercussion of some parents not teaching their children that it\u2019s important to honor a commitment when something else comes along they happen to like better.\n\nFrom a business standpoint I\u2019m sure you feel the squeeze: some kids are practicing, ready and excited so you cannot cancel and let them down.\n\nThe other kids wanna do what they wanna do and the parents are supporting them.\n\nI have no great advice because really you\u2019re being squeezed in the middle and there\u2019s not much you can do about it. And you have to keep the parents happy enough that they continue to pay dance tuition.\n\nOnly thing I can say is, have the performance with the reduced squad. That demonstrates that you honor your commitments.", "NTA. It is a stupid homecoming dance. It is not going to shape their lives. The parents/dancers signed a contract. They need to honor that and not just let them go because they want to. What is wrong with you people?  Oh let me pay a bunch of money, let them practice and learn the dance and skip out on the performance because they wanna hang out with their friends?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
