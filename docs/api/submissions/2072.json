Trust me, your SIL knows how much she weighs. She might be perfectly happy with her current weight, she might not be, but it\u2019s really none of your business either way.

You have no business saying or doing anything other than exactly what she asks for in terms of cake.\n\nETA: also holy shit the audacity to even mention a 6 month PP woman\u2019s weight and appearance.

So much to unpack here.  How is fruit in anyway a wedding cake?  How does taking away one of the most symbolic parts of a wedding reception in anyway a good idea?

Pregnant women can gain between 20-70 pounds and it depends on the mother, the baby and different body types. Your comments about her body will reflect poorly on you and demonstrate your ignorance regarding pregnant women and postpartum hormones. \n\nFurther, your FSIL will remember how you made her feel during her pregnancy and this very probable cake fiasco!

Especially since your reasoning centers around the fact that you're judging your SIL for having gained weight. You have absolutely no idea how she feels about her body or her current weight, you have NO idea if she would feel guilt or bad about having a slice of actual cake on her fucking wedding day. You clearly have some body image/food issues yourself and I worry that you're projecting those onto your SIL here. \n\nIf you're not able to just do what you agreed to, which was to provide the wedding cake, just say that you're not able to help out.
