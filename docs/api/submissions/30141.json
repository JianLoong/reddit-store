If your neighbors are doing the things you're saying then animal control should be called to investigate the situation. If they find your neighbors to be neglectful then they can make sure they are never able to adopt another animal again. You and your neighbors secretly stealing their pets won't do anything other than save the current animal at hand. That's good, but the better thing would be to make sure they can't have any animals in the future either.", "NTA\n\nYou would be actively saving the dog and other dogs in the future from your neighbors.", "NTA. You're stopping animal abuse. And it's great that you called the pound and vet clinic.

Plus, if they actually cared for that dog they would already know where she is, they would've joined fb groups, check local shelters and contacted animal control.

If animal control sees that they are abusing the animals the penalties will be harsher than simply they can't adopt anymore. They'll be hit with fines and even potential jail time if they keep doing it. You want to alert the authorities so they have record of their abuse. The first offense they might get off with a slap on the wrist. But over time if they keep doing it then the penalties will be harsher and harsher.", "Of course you would!  You\u2019re a good person, I can tell this because you protected an innocent dog from neglect and abuse.", "It\u2019s just already with the appropriate authority to make decisions on the dogs future.
