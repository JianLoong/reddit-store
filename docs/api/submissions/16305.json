Also, well, she wasn\u2019t ever exactly the most present or supportive mom to begin with. \n\nAnyway, I left it to my husband to explain to her that since I was a mom now, the actual day was going to be mine. We\u2019d get with her either later that day or another day. She went apeshit. Yelling, crying, acting like a literal child. I hid in another room. Ahem.

My middle child, also happens to be her birthday this year.  My youngest graduates college the day before.  Whew.  That does not answer your question, does it?  What I would do is take both moms out the day before.  If they complain, tell them, they are on their own then, but as for my family, this is \u201cour\u201d tradition from now on.

I've always disliked the idea that one has to go visit/spend the day with your own mothers and fathers when you have children of your own.  It always leads to someone getting their feelings hurt because you spent more time/had a meal with the inlaws than your own parent.  Start your tradition now.", "NTA. I personally feel the main person celebrated on mothers and fathers days should be the parents in the thick of actively parenting. Sure send mom and MIL a card and flowers, or run over a quick gift, but the priority should be the parent doing the active parenting.

I thank you for your service!!

I was discussing this with my friends and we all agreed - those with kids at home under 18 want to spend the day alone, with a book, or at a spa, or sleeping in a hotel room with room service. Anywhere they don\u2019t actually have to do the same 24/7 job they do 364 days of the year. They want peace and quiet and massages and hairstyles and wine.

Did my sister mutter butter \"You realise pretty soon that it's no big deal?\" Also yes.\n\nMy answer to my mother was \"**I** am a mother too now. It's my fucking right after having a child to get at the very least the first mother's day to myself and my family. You have 4 kids and have had mother's days for over 40 years. You are being selfish. You should be encouraging me to have a day to myself since you as a mother understand the importance.\" \n\nTo my sister I said \"Wow, are you that bitter that I have the courage to put down a boundary with our mother and you didn't?\" \n\nGive your wife the most epic mother's day and you hereby have another Hispanic mom's full blown permission to **never** feel any guilt in prioritizing your wife on mother's day.\n\nEdit to add: NTA"]}
