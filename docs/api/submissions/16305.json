She seemed to think every Mother\u2019s Day had to revolve around her, even after I became a mom and hell, my mom was just left out of the equation. Mind you, this only applied to my husband and I because her other children live out of town. Also, well, she wasn\u2019t ever exactly the most present or supportive mom to begin with. \n\nAnyway, I left it to my husband to explain to her that since I was a mom now, the actual day was going to be mine. We\u2019d get with her either later that day or another day. She went apeshit. Yelling, crying, acting like a literal child. I hid in another room. Ahem. Things have been more distant since then but we had to do it and we\u2019re much happier. \n\nNTA OP. You have to look out for your family.
