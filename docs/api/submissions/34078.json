A person told you their upset and asked you to do something. We can accommodate people or not by our choice. \n\nAll you gotta do is imagine socialising with your friend and imagine her misery on hearing that name. If the thought upsets you, pick another, there are many. If it doesn't carry on. This is the \"burden\" - do you care or not. \n\nRhetorically speaking,the stuff about disrespecting her dead baby is a bit much but it sounds like she's still struggling with it. Making this a belligerent issue of her trampling on your rights is also a bit much.\n\nAnd I don't know why you'd be so committed to the name still, after this.", "INFO: Are you willing to lose a friend over this name?", "No AHs here.

Maybe your friend will get over it, maybe you will lose a friend. Is the name worth it?", "NTA- You were unaware of that fact until she told you. So, most definitely NTA. This might be the rock she is willing to die on though so I would keep that in mind during the next confrontation. So you might lose a friendship.\n\nI personally would argue that by keeping the name it is even more special. Seriously, what is the likelihood that you both choose the same unique old-fashioned name? Could be a sign :) Not to mention, it would be honoring her daughter in a way.", "NTA - Your baby, your right to name it whatever you want.

But this is why you tell no one a baby's name til its born. Kinda personal choice to keep it or change it though, possible you lose a friend."]}
