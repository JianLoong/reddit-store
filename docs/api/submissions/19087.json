We were planning on getting there pretty early to hangout for a bit. Everyone knew this plan for a long time but for some reason Marissa couldn\u2019t/didn\u2019t get off work. She is a server at a breakfast restaurant and normally doesn\u2019t work too late. This was all on Saturday btw. \n\nI also have an older sister who lives in this city who really wanted to go but couldn\u2019t. She begged me to be a backup in case anything happened. We don\u2019t live very close to the city (like an hour drive sometimes longer) so we planned on leaving at 2 PM.\n\nAt around 1 I started texting everyone to get ready because I had to start picking people up. Marissa told us she should get off around 12 but she didn\u2019t say anything when I texted the group. I texted her individually and called her. No response. I started picking up everyone and she was the last person to get. I kept calling and we waited outside her house for a bit, I said fuck it so I went to the door. Her answered and said Marissa has not come home yet. Together we decided to leave without her. \n\nWe got 20 minutes into the drive when all our phones started blowing up. It was Marissa apologizing and saying there was issues at work and she had to stay but she\u2019s speeding home and will be ready in 15 minutes. It was like 230 at this point. \n\nAiden called her and explained what happened and I could hear her screaming her head off at him. He eventually hung up on her. My sister met us there and zelle\u2019d the money to Marissa in the exact amount she paid me.

You had PLENTY OF TIME to wait. \n\nAll you had to do was stay at her house for a few minutes but instead you drove off like you were in a getaway car and now you have bad blood. Why\u2019d you have to be so mean?", "Wow. YTA. And I would never want to be friends with you or your group. She paid for her ticket. You couldn\u2019t have transferred her ticket to her (most tickets are e-tickets nowadays anyway) and said \u201chey sorry, we left but here\u2019s your ticket - meet us there\u201d?? That\u2019s such a shitty thing to do. Especially for a Taylor swift show when you know tickets are impossible to find and it will probably be a couple of years before she tours again. I don\u2019t blame Marisa for cutting all of you off completely.", "YTA. Once she paid you, that was her ticket. You don\u2019t get to give it away if she wasn\u2019t consulted prior. You were so early. You would have been able to wait for like 20 minutes longer. Or you could have asked her to get there herself if you felt that you absolutely had to leave that time. There were options!!!", "INFO: it sounds like your sister drove separately and met you at the venue; why was this not an option you gave Marissa?\n\nAlso, what time was the concert scheduled & what time did you actually get there?\n\nDid y'all call her work or stop by to see why she was held up?", "YTA. Sooooooo TA. It was not your ticket. She paid for it. It was hers. You had no right!\n\nHow long did you wait to let your sister steal her ticket? Why couldn\u2019t she be given the option to meet you there? Did you even _try_ to figure out how to get her there? Stop by her work with clothes so she could change on the way? Give one single damn about her? Of course not because you wanted sister to go more. What a horrible friend all of you are.", "YTA. You killed a friendship for 30mins. You still arrived A FEW HOURS early for the show. You wanted  your sister to go instead of your \"friend\". Shame on you.", "YTA. I think you were anxious to give the ticket to your sister. You knew she was at work. One of ya could\u2019ve called her work or tried harder. That was a shitty think to do.", "Yta. That was her ticket. I could see someone taking it at the last minute, but hours early?\n\nYou guys are atrocious friends and she deserves better.", "YTA if she paid you. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m confused about the timeline. 2:30 seems pretty early to go to a concert.", "YTA\n\nIt wasn't your ticket to give away. Given that you wanted to hang out before the concert even started, her delay wouldn't have harmed you.", "YTA - I\u2019m obnoxious about being on time but good lord, for an event like this you could have made an exception. The concert wasn\u2019t going to start at 3. You had more than enough time. I wouldn\u2019t be talking to either.", "YTA: not your tix to sell to begin with plain and simple.", "YTA. She would not have been late for the concert, you guys were all early by hours. She was delayed for 30 minutes, there would have still been time to hang out. The money was probably nothing compared to how excited she was to see the concert and be with her friends. You may have just ruined this friendship.", "You guys are too old to be dealing out this much immaturity.

She called you at 2.30pm. When you had already given your sister the ticket - 30 minutes earlier.\n\nYou gave her ticket away at 2pm. The time you were supposed to collect her.\n\nThere was no wait time. You gave her ticket away when she hadn\u2019t even been 10 minutes late.\n\nWhen you knew you were going to arrive 4 hours before the doors even opened. It wasn\u2019t yours to \u201csell\u201d and then you sold it for the face price?\n\nIf Marissa couldn\u2019t go it was her right to sell it at the best possible price - you scammed her out of hundreds of dollars. So yes, you stole her property and scammed her.\n\nYTA.\n\nYou haven\u2019t lost your friendship - you sold it out. You willingly trashed it.\n\n(ETA fixing name as I didn\u2019t catch spellcheck changing Marissa to Melissa when I posted!)", "YTA because it wasn\u2019t your ticket to give away. She paid for that ticket so I can only imagine the absolute disappointment and anger she felt when she found out you just gave it away after only 30 MINUTES of her not responding - and you guys knew her whereabouts so she wasn\u2019t just bailing. Even though you refunded her, it\u2019s still so messed up. \u201cWe had a blast\u201d shows your lack of care and I honestly hope she cuts you all off for good.", "YTA. She paid for the ticket, you had NO RIGHT to substitute someone without Marissa green-lighting it first. You\u2019re terrible friends.", "You're all absolutely TA. You knew she was at work. If it was 230, that's *several* hours before the concert starts. I can't even believe you're bothering to come to Reddit to ask, because the answer is so obvious.", "Info\n\nWhy didn't you, idk, not just DRIVE to the restaurant to check on her?!", "I hope you never have anything unexpected happen to you only to find your friends don\u2019t think you\u2019re important enough to a. either find out what\u2019s going on or b. wait for you when you had plans.  You could easily have gone to her work or waited until she got home bc you had more than enough time, but you didn\u2019t bc you wanted your sister to go.  Hope you gave her the money back at least. \n\nYTA and a shitty friend. If I was Marissa I\u2019d be done w this friendship bc you\u2019ve shown your true colors. ETA-before you say \u201cit\u2019s just a concert\u201d that\u2019s exactly the point.  You potentially tossed a friendship away for being some place an extra hour early.  how would you feel if she did it to you?", "Yta. Her delay wasn't going to make you late for doors opening to the show.", "YTA.\n\nYou could have hang out later, but going again with her friends to a Taylor Swift concert is very difficult to happen again and she wasn\u00b4t late because she was being lazy, it was because of her work.", "YTA\n\nYou could've waited and her mom telling you she hadn't been home yet should've been reason enough for you to wait a bit to hear from her. She didn't plan on working later, sometimes it just happens. \n\nIf it had gone over an hour then I could understand but <30 minutes ? Y'all got me fucked up. I wouldn't talk to y'all either LMAO. \n\nDid y'all even pay her back ?", "Of course YTA!", "YTA.   why couldn\u2019t she just meet you at the show?", "YTA. You knew Marissa had work and didn't communicate with her individually until the last minute. You should have made a plan beforehand to account for her work schedule. Leaving her behind without confirming if she had a way to get there was a dick move.", "YTA. And you're a crappy friend.", "YTA you couldn't turn around and pick her up? Or let her meet you there? Really? \n\nThe Eras tour is legit a historical event (I know that sounds dramatic but this tour is HUGE and she's getting close to being the next Michael Jackson). You took this away from her.\n\nI'd be shocked if she ever speaks to you again.", "YTA. You admit that you were getting there early to hangout, so it\u2019s not as if she was actually late to the concert. Not saying you should\u2019ve turned around and went back to get her, but you could have at least asked if she wanted to/could meet you guys there before you invited your sister instead.", "YTA\n\nYou could have waited, just didn\u2019t want to. Not like you would miss the concert.", "YTA you knew she was working as a server, servers cant just check their phones when they want to. Why didnt you go to her place of work instead? \n\nAlso, you start out by saying its happening in your city, and then you say you dont live close to the city?", "YTA. She was working hard to get there, she didn\u2019t even ask you guys to give her like 30 mins to get ready she was just gonna throw something on. She\u2019s been excited for this forever, and not everyone can just take a day off work. You all suck, except Marissa", "YTA, you\u2019re a shitty friend for that.", "YTA 30 mins is not a big deal if u didn\u2019t want to wait you could have told her to meet u guys wherever u we\u2019re headed.", "YTA and a huge one! If you wanted to loose a friend, congrats you have sealed the nail in that coffin. With friends like you, who needs enemies.", "YTA - Once she paid you for the ticket, it was no longer yours to give/sell away. It also sounds like she would have been able to make the actual concert, just not some of the hanging out.", "See this is a hard one but YTA.  Y'all wanted to get there early but didn't have the time to wait for someone who paid and waited SO LONG for that concert, just as you had. Yeah, you paid her back but that doesn't change how long you're friend was looking forward to that concert.", "YTA, obviously.", "YTA\n\nYou guys agreed to meet at 2:00 and you left at 2:10? That is really shitty. And the concert is only an hour away? Taylor Swift is not perform at 4 PM.\n\nN T A only if you waited as long as you possibly could without putting your attendance at risk. You knew she intended to come but things happen.\n\nHopefully, this experience with your sister was worth ruining a friendship over.", "This just all reads like you wanted to give the ticket to your sister from the start. Couldn't you have driven past her work? Did you say clearly that 2 would be a hard cutoff time?\n\nIt also doesn't sound like you even saved her ticket - she would have had plenty of time to get there by herself until 6. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. If she already paid for her ticket, then you stole it without her permission. Paying her later doesn\u2019t make it right.", "YTA\n\nDid calling her job, or even just stopping by, not cross any of your minds? You lack critical thinking", "Massive massive massive YTA. HUGE.", ">At around 1 I started texting everyone to get ready because I had to start picking people up.\n\nINFO...\n\nWhy did you need to text people day-of about the timing? Was this schedule not agreed upon ahead of time?\n\nWould you have been late if you turned around to pick up your friend?\n\nDid your friend have any other way to arrive at the concert on time?", "YTA !!! Would it have killed you to wait at her house for a bit? Just twenty minutes would have made a major difference. Not to mention the fact that you wouldn\u2019t have been late to the CONCERT regardless. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Marissa never spoke to you guys again\u2014 and rightfully so.", "YTA. She paid for the ticket. It was hers. You had them, and you were at her house. Couldn't you just leave her ticket there? If it is online, I am sure there was a way to give it to her too. You are one bad friend.", "Damn, gurl. You are **SOOOO** TA, as are Haley and Aiden. She already paid you for her ticket. You *knew* she got hung up at work and you *knew* she was still there because her mom told you she hadn't been home yet. Why didn't you just leave her ticket with her mother?

It was Marissa apologizing and saying there was issues at work and she had to stay but she\u2019s speeding home and will be ready in 15 minutes.

MINUTES.** For one of your \"besties\". *smh*\n\nThere are so many a$$hole-ish things about all of this. Bottom line, though, is that you are a truly horrible friend. I hope Marissa has some true friends in her life because y\"all ain't it.", "YTA", "YTA and your sister should have paid scalp ticket pricing. Those last minute tickets were going for many thousands of dollars. Can't even believe you don't know what a horrible thing you all did. Maybe Taylor will read this and do the girl a solid and write a song about shit friends.", "YTA. With friends like you, who needs enemies. \n\nStop trying to justify what you did. You gave away HER ticket so you could go with your sister. Not to mention you went hours early. She could still have gone if you hadn\u2019t given her ticket away. I also deem it as theft because that ticket didn\u2019t belong to you. Your sister also owes her more money. If she had sold it that day then she\u2019d have gotten way more money that what your sister gave her. \n\nOn another note, a lot of workplaces do not allow you to use your phone. I don\u2019t care if your previous or current job allowed it. Fact is a fair amount do not. She did get in touch with you after and by then you were basically like sorry SOL. \n\nI hope you realize your friendship is definitely over. You have to deal with the consequences of your actions. I hope it was worth it.\n\nEdit: a word", "INFO: Did she know there was a backup and her ticket could get sold? How far ahead did you make the pan to leave at 2pm?", "YTA X100. So you couldn't have driven by her work to see what was up? No you did this on purpose because of your sister. And your other friends suck to for not stopping you. You not only owe her the money back, but I would try and get tickets at another venue for her to make up for your selfishness. Even your mom thinks YTA - so why are you asking here?", "YTA I know concerts don\u2019t started before 5 and since y\u2019all are driving, you could\u2019ve waited a bit more. You\u2019re a massive asshole. I hope nothing but bad luck and shit thing happens to you.", "YTA x13000. Doors open at 6 and Taylor doesn\u2019t even get on stage til 8.

Because you said it wasn\u2019t her ticket to give away. So why was she the one in possession of it rather than the owner of it.", "Yeah I responded to OP to dig deeper. Something doesn\u2019t feel right. \n\nThe swifties have amassed into a swarm though. This is kind of amazing. Like a video of a bee hive melting a hornet that broke in.", "It wasnt hers to give away because Marissa paid her for it\u2026 but have you ever bought concert tickets?

She was able to transfer her money easily enough.

So I\u2019ll be honest you all suck here. Marissa for her terrible time management and committing to 12 but then not notifying anyone in the 2 hours.

Sure, she'd probably miss out on some of the pre-concert festivities but that's probably fine. PLUS it's her ticket you're holding - you can't just sell it to someone else because it's not yours. Just screenshot the QR code and send it to her and say you are heading out, but meet you'll meet her there. Yea, she was MIA for a bit, but she was at work! Idk if you work or not but stuff happens at work at the drop of a dime and you just get busy and can't do anything else.\n\nEven AFTER you sold the ticket to your sister, you still could have backtracked and said you reached Marissa and looks like she can make it. Your sister (if she's not an AH) would have understood that. And if she bitched to you and you made your AITA post about THAT, the verdict would probably be N T A.\n\nI just can't get over you ditching her and selling her ticket and she wasn't even late. I have held tickets for friends that weren't even there by the time the movie/concert/show started. Lol. Wtf. Also, this is one of the hottest shows in like... history. Not surprised she doesn't talk to any of you any more. I feel like you all treat Marissa as 'that' friend where for whatever reason, nobody really wants her there, so you were just looking for ANY excuse to ditch her. \n\nAlso, real nice move with putting in that you all had a blast while your friend is missing out due to you screwing her over. No guilt whatsoever. This is so insane that I almost feel like this is fake. Nobody can be this clueless right?", "Wow YTA If someone stole a Taylor Swift concert ticket from me I would definitely do more than just cut you off.", "YTA- OP has continually not answered why she didn\u2019t send the ticket and let Marissa drive herself.

Then it\u2019s how u that u had the right to sell something that doesn\u2019t belong to u? Another why was your sister contacted and on her way so quickly and why u couldn\u2019t say hey sorry she called and it is her ticket? I hope u guys weren\u2019t super close bc u might have lost her and I\u2019m sure u so easily dismissing her and her feelings hurt worse than missing a concert.

Just because you can doesn't mean she should. If my friend and I had plans and I KNEW she was working I would've just emailed her the ticket and been like hope to see you there, if she doesn't make it and ends up losing money, now it's on her, but I'm not just going to not even give her HER ticket. She paid for it, it was not yours to sell. \n\nLike why was it ok for your sister to meet you there but not Marissa. This all seems so shady.\n\n\nYou are all horrible friends, but sometimes it takes big things like this for people to show you who you are. You guys showed Marissa what her place/value is in your lives, and she now knows she needs new and better friends. \n\nI just laugh bc ironically Taylor Swift probably wouldn't be fan of how you treat your friends...

If you were in such a rush to leave at 2pm the absolute minimum you could have done for a friend is to leave the ticket which SHE PAID FOR with her mum and she could catch up later.

She's in the service industry, and generally they're not allowed to use their phones while they're working, so you shouldn't expect a response.\n\n2. You were already heading to the concert way early. Waiting 30 minutes wouldn't have made you miss the concert, which is the main reason you were going.\n\n3. This is my biggest reason why YTA. You may have initially purchased the tickets, but your friend paid you for that ticket. That makes the ticket hers, and you have no right to sell it without her consent. It doesn't matter if your sister sent her the money, your friend did not give you permission to sell it in the first place. If your sister wanted to go so bad, she should've gotten a ticket and paid what was being asked or asked you to get her one when you were initially purchasing. You can't sell something to someone else that doesn't belong to you.", "YTA \n\nWhy do you keep trying to deflect blame for being a thief? You stole from her for your sister. That ticket was worth many times its face value, AND YOU KNEW IT, so that's what she's owed, not face value. \n\nYou were literally at her house and could have left the ticket that belonged to her, but you thought you'd be cute and just steal it instead. You're despicable.", "YTA. She could actually sue you for that.

If she works as a server, of course she couldn't answer her cell phone, and your post doesn't say anything about calling in to her work to check if your friend is alright, how did you know an emergency didn't happen? Do you even care about your friend at all?

That was on a weekday when I had to deal with some rush hour traffic. You may have been going to Solider Field (deeper into the city) but it was on a Saturday when traffic going into the city is much less crazy than a weekday. You made no mention of parking concerns, so I'm assuming you already had parking reserved (which I'm not just assuming, I know because the local news was talking all week about all nearby parking being booked so if you hadn't booked you would have been screwed, and you made no complaints).

The day of the concert, he decided to take one of his friends instead. For weeks, people asked me how the show was, and I was so embarrassed to say I didn't get to go.

They'll probably pretend to be Marissa and steal from her again.", "All OP will ever be is mean", "Exactly, considering last minute tickets sell for so much higher. If Marissa paid for that ticket, it was her property not OP. Major YTA OP.", "If the friend group is smart, they will ditch OP.  \n\n\nYTA.", "Also if you're only 20 mins into the drive and your friend says they'll be ready in 15 go back and get them. Is being 45 mins late or whatever for your arbitrary super early arrival time worth binning a friendship over?", "To be fair, the last few concerts I've been to, all the tickets have been digitally sent to the Ticketmater account on file, digital wallet. All three of our tickets for Backstreet Boys plus our parking pass  were sent to it.  No way to print them.  That made for a fun time when my sister went to get something to drink and then had to get back down to our floor seats.  OP may not have been able to physically separate the tickets.\n\nHowever, OP is still definitely YTA.", "I mean, you should be able to trust that your friend isn't a backstabbing b.", "The way tickets work here is that they're all together and in my name if I ordered. So I couldn't really send someone their ticket. Some places won't even let people in without the person whose name is on the ticket. \n\nRegardless, this is super shitty. Even if they'd have to wait, it would be like what? 45 mins? They arrived around 3pm, so plenty of time? Most concerts start at 7-8pm.", "I don\u2019t normally bother, but if I\u2019m running late I\u2019d say something like \u201chey, I\u2019m running 30 minutes late, how about I meet you there? Can you send me the ticket just in case\u201d\n\n\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "They are 20 year olds, probably raised on social media causing them to become narcissistic AH. It doesn't surprise me that some young people at this age lack understanding. I mean come on, they had to make an entire post to ask if they did anything wrong.", "OP is too ashamed to comment (at least, I hope that's the case).", "Agree with this, the \u201cWe had a blast.\u201d right after describing how Marissa was screaming and some other member of this group hung up on her truly shows how much OP doesn\u2019t care and is a major major major AH. Damn, I\u2019d never want to have OP in my entourage, let alone in my friend group", "\"This was so calculated and mean.\"\n\n^^ This. I highly doubt OP told anyone ahead of time that she would resell their ticket if they weren't ready when she was either. And you got to think that her friend probably didn't stop trying to get ahold of someone for her ticket just after they hung up.  They all just blissfully ignored her for hours ahead of event/during, while they had \"an amazing time\". Bunch of AH's especially OP.", "The only reason is that OP manipulated the situation to get the ticket to her sister. I'm sure she'd have done the same to any of her \"friends\" had they been \"late\" instead. \n\nI've known people like OP.. my life was way better when I got them out of it.", "Also as far as I know, almost every show has moved to electronic ticketing. She could have literally texted her the ticket. They didn\u2019t have to even meet up. I don\u2019t agree with all the scalping comments but they should have sent her her tickets. No amount of money will replace the experience of seeing that show. OP, YOU ARE MOST DEFINITELY THE ASSHOLE, you deserve to lose a friend because you went out of your way to screw her. YTA", "Wow. So sad. What a story. I'm sorry!!\ud83d\udc9c", "I'm not sure what the courts could do, though, since she got her money back. I get that prices go up the closer you get to the date through scarcity, but in some states (I know in mine) scalping tickets is illegal, so I don't think arguing for more money would work. At least where I live.", "Yep!!! And even then I would have NEVER, EVER called someone else up and sold them her ticket\u2026 if she never showed up, that\u2019s just her money lost", "RIGHT she absolutely could have arrived late for HER ticket. She could have arrived whatever time she wanted to.  I hope Marissa sues her.", "I haven't listened to Taylor's last few albums, but that just screams Avril Lavigne to me?", "She\u2019s not doing meet and greets on this tour, but I have heard her team are hooking SOME people up.\n\nI\u2019m not on Twitter but best bet is for someone to link on Twitter and tag TaylorNation.", "\ud83d\ude44", "They're an hour away and the doors didn't even open until 430, so leaving at 230 means they're an hour early before they can even get in. The show itself didn't start until 630 so three hours before the show started. I know some people like to be early, but there's no reason to screw your friend over to get somewhere 3 hours early when you can't even get in yet.", "Yes this. Totally inexcusable.\n\nIt's her right to leave without someone running late, though that's being a pretty shitty friend.\n\nBut the ticket was not hers to sell.", "$1000? Lol, i'll take that in a heartbeat. It's like 3000 for nosebleeds in Detroit right now.", "An entire car full of a$$holes. They really showed their true colors.", "It\u2019s a parody of Taylor\u2019s song Dear John from Speak Now in 2010", "And mean, and mean, and mean", "Damn that makes me feel that OP wanted her sister to join them since the beginning.", "The doors didn't even open until 430 from what I just saw online, meaning even leaving at 230 they probably got there an hour before they could even get in.The show itself didn't start until 630! Even if Marissa left at 330 she would have been fine and getting there around the time the doors opened, and still 2 hours before the show started. But OP took her ticket and sold it out from under her. Seriously messed up.", "I wonder if this is considered theft, and since the tickets were now worth far more, a possible felony? I don't know how the laws work, but I really hope the friend sues her.", "It\u2019s irrelevant really. The ticket wasn\u2019t OPs to sell on, period. Doesn\u2019t matter which way you cut it, OP sold someone else\u2019s property without their permission. \n\nFirstly it\u2019s a major dick move that makes OP a huge AH and secondly, there\u2019s possibly a level of criminal action for the sale of something that OP didn\u2019t own, had no legal right to sell and that the owner could have got significantly more for selling to a stranger desperate to get it - so sold massively under the value it held on the day. \n\nOP is a HUGE AH.", "So she arranged to steal someone else\u2019s! YTA.", "Yeah, I'm in Joliet, and knew people who couldn't get tickets. OP IS TA for sure.", "This comment \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\nThe ticket didn't belong to OP. Massive YTA", "Exactly.\n\nWhen I read that everyone had already paid OP back for THEIR ticket my first thought was that OP sold a ticket that didn't belong to her. \n\nThat is theft.\n\nAnd at the time she sold it the fair market price for the ticket was not what Marissa had paid for it. It had appreciated due to scarcity and was worth at least 3 or 4 times the face value.", "YTA / AIDEN IS TA / EVERYONE IN CAR IS TA", "Marissa gonna be in court for murdering you and the jury gonna be like hmm yeah that\u2019s reasonable \ud83e\udd23", "Big time YTA, OP. And I think you knew that before you asked.", "This. They were happy to spend hours hanging around before the show but could only stomach 10 minutes waiting for their friend.\n\nIt's time for Marissa to find new friends.", "She was in Chicago this weekend and the show time started at 6:30. The gates didn't even open until 4:30 lol. What an AH", "I was thinking this too, as I've been keeping up with her tour well enough to know she goes on at 8. They'll be in the city Taylor's playing in by 4, at the latest, if they leave at 2:30. Why do they need to hang out for 4 hours before the show starts? Just wait a little longer? Transfer the ticket to the friend? If it's printed out, leave it at their home? Tell them you'll meet them there? It just doesn't make sense, Marissa wasn't late for the concert at all, the group just left 4 hours early for no reason. I feel so bad for her. If any of my friends did something like this when I've been planning to see an artist I love for ages, they'd be dead to me.", "This, exactly. How heartless.", "OP planned for her sister to have Marissa's ticket.", "Frankly, it I were either Aiden or Haley, I would\u2019ve gone out of the car the minute OP called her sister. Or if I\u2019m being petty, I would have waited until we got to the venue, snagged myself some Taylor merch, left my ticket with OP and stole her car keys to drive myself home, careully parked the car in OP\u2019s driveway, placed the keys under the doormat, and taken an uber to my own house. I mean, eras tour is eras tour, but not worth basically betraying my friend.", "It was theft, she sold a ticket that didn't belong to her. If I was the friend, if she has proof of purchase I think I would see about pressing charges for theft.", "What's to say the now ex-friend doesn't attempt to sue the OP or OP's sister for the actual cost of buying a ticket to the heavily sold-out concert on the day (so $1000-$1500) and report the OP to the police for theft as the ticket wasn't hers to resell.  The fact they didn't even think to go to the (ex) friends workplace to find out what was happening and where she was, makes me think this 'sell to the sister' was the plan all along for anyone who didn't turn up at the exact time OP had set to leave.  Their was plenty of time for the (ex) friend to make their own way to the venue after arriving home, even asking a family member to drive them there to meet up with OP and the other two friends.  Its not like the unexpected work commitments ran up to just before the concert start time and there was no chance of the (ex) friend making the concert in time.      \n\nOP - Don't be surprised if the other two friends that went to the concert with you start gaining distance from you after they've had time to reflect on the events running up to the concert as it could've been their ticket that was sold from under them, and if its not clear, you are the major AH here, unquestionably.", "ty for the correction.", "I definitely would. This is absolutely theft, there's no grey area here. It absolutely blows my mind that OP is surprised that Marissa hasn't spoken to OP since this happened--why would anyone want to maintain a relationship with someone who would steal from them and act like it's okay?", "Isn't \"reasonably priced ticket\" a bit of an oxymoron when applied to this concert?", "This is where I'm lost on this. Maybe some concerts are different (though the one concert I've been to since the pandemic let up was the same), but I'm a sports fan and it's all digital tickets anymore. If I buy for a group, as soon as they pay me for their ticket, I transfer it to them, and I no longer have control of that ticket once they accept the transfer. I would not agree to let someone else buy for a group unless they transferred my ticket to me upon payment for it!\n\nYeah, Marissa missed her ride, and it would be fair to say that she had to find her own way to town, but she should have had control of that ticket from the moment she paid OP. OP is TA!"]}
