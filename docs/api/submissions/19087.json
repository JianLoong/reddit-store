We were planning on getting there pretty early to hangout for a bit. Everyone knew this plan for a long time but for some reason Marissa couldn\u2019t/didn\u2019t get off work. She is a server at a breakfast restaurant and normally doesn\u2019t work too late. This was all on Saturday btw. \n\nI also have an older sister who lives in this city who really wanted to go but couldn\u2019t. She begged me to be a backup in case anything happened. We don\u2019t live very close to the city (like an hour drive sometimes longer) so we planned on leaving at 2 PM.\n\nAt around 1 I started texting everyone to get ready because I had to start picking people up. Marissa told us she should get off around 12 but she didn\u2019t say anything when I texted the group. I texted her individually and called her. No response. I started picking up everyone and she was the last person to get. I kept calling and we waited outside her house for a bit, I said fuck it so I went to the door. Her answered and said Marissa has not come home yet. Together we decided to leave without her. \n\nWe got 20 minutes into the drive when all our phones started blowing up. It was Marissa apologizing and saying there was issues at work and she had to stay but she\u2019s speeding home and will be ready in 15 minutes. It was like 230 at this point. \n\nAiden called her and explained what happened and I could hear her screaming her head off at him. He eventually hung up on her. My sister met us there and zelle\u2019d the money to Marissa in the exact amount she paid me. We had a blast. \n\nI\u2019m asking if I was an asshole because none of us have heard from Marissa since even after apologizing.", "created_utc": 1686008595, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141wdfy/aita_for_giving_away_my_friends_ticket_to_the/", "score": 1078, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You had PLENTY OF TIME to wait. \n\nAll you had to do was stay at her house for a few minutes but instead you drove off like you were in a getaway car and now you have bad blood. Why\u2019d you have to be so mean?", "Wow. YTA. And I would never want to be friends with you or your group. She paid for her ticket. You couldn\u2019t have transferred her ticket to her (most tickets are e-tickets nowadays anyway) and said \u201chey sorry, we left but here\u2019s your ticket - meet us there\u201d?? That\u2019s such a shitty thing to do. Especially for a Taylor swift show when you know tickets are impossible to find and it will probably be a couple of years before she tours again. I don\u2019t blame Marisa for cutting all of you off completely.", "YTA. Once she paid you, that was her ticket. You don\u2019t get to give it away if she wasn\u2019t consulted prior. You were so early. You would have been able to wait for like 20 minutes longer. Or you could have asked her to get there herself if you felt that you absolutely had to leave that time. There were options!!!", "INFO: it sounds like your sister drove separately and met you at the venue; why was this not an option you gave Marissa?\n\nAlso, what time was the concert scheduled & what time did you actually get there?\n\nDid y'all call her work or stop by to see why she was held up?", "YTA. Sooooooo TA. It was not your ticket. She paid for it. It was hers. You had no right!\n\nHow long did you wait to let your sister steal her ticket? Why couldn\u2019t she be given the option to meet you there? Did you even _try_ to figure out how to get her there? Stop by her work with clothes so she could change on the way? Give one single damn about her? Of course not because you wanted sister to go more. What a horrible friend all of you are.", "YTA. You killed a friendship for 30mins. You still arrived A FEW HOURS early for the show. You wanted  your sister to go instead of your \"friend\". Shame on you.", "YTA. I think you were anxious to give the ticket to your sister. You knew she was at work. One of ya could\u2019ve called her work or tried harder. That was a shitty think to do.", "Yta. That was her ticket. I could see someone taking it at the last minute, but hours early?\n\nYou guys are atrocious friends and she deserves better.", "YTA if she paid you. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m confused about the timeline. 2:30 seems pretty early to go to a concert.", "YTA\n\nIt wasn't your ticket to give away. Given that you wanted to hang out before the concert even started, her delay wouldn't have harmed you.", "YTA - I\u2019m obnoxious about being on time but good lord, for an event like this you could have made an exception. The concert wasn\u2019t going to start at 3. You had more than enough time. I wouldn\u2019t be talking to either.", "YTA: not your tix to sell to begin with plain and simple.", "YTA. She would not have been late for the concert, you guys were all early by hours. She was delayed for 30 minutes, there would have still been time to hang out. The money was probably nothing compared to how excited she was to see the concert and be with her friends.

She called you at 2.30pm. When you had already given your sister the ticket - 30 minutes earlier.\n\nYou gave her ticket away at 2pm. The time you were supposed to collect her.\n\nThere was no wait time. You gave her ticket away when she hadn\u2019t even been 10 minutes late.\n\nWhen you knew you were going to arrive 4 hours before the doors even opened. It wasn\u2019t yours to \u201csell\u201d and then you sold it for the face price?\n\nIf Melissa couldn\u2019t go it was her right to sell it at the best possible price - you scammed her out of hundreds of dollars. So yes, you stole her property and scammed her.\n\nYTA.\n\nYou haven\u2019t lost your friendship - you sold it out. You willingly trashed it.", "YTA because it wasn\u2019t your ticket to give away. She paid for that ticket so I can only imagine the absolute disappointment and anger she felt when she found out you just gave it away after only 30 MINUTES of her not responding - and you guys knew her whereabouts so she wasn\u2019t just bailing. Even though you refunded her, it\u2019s still so messed up. \u201cWe had a blast\u201d shows your lack of care and I honestly hope she cuts you all off for good.", "YTA. She paid for the ticket, you had NO RIGHT to substitute someone without Marissa green-lighting it first. You\u2019re terrible friends.", "You're all absolutely TA. You knew she was at work. If it was 230, that's *several* hours before the concert starts. I can't even believe you're bothering to come to Reddit to ask, because the answer is so obvious.", "Info\n\nWhy didn't you, idk, not just DRIVE to the restaurant to check on her?!", "I hope you never have anything unexpected happen to you only to find your friends don\u2019t think you\u2019re important enough to a. either find out what\u2019s going on or b. wait for you when you had plans.  You could easily have gone to her work or waited until she got home bc you had more than enough time, but you didn\u2019t bc you wanted your sister to go.  Hope you gave her the money back at least. \n\nYTA and a shitty friend. If I was Marissa I\u2019d be done w this friendship bc you\u2019ve shown your true colors. ETA-before you say \u201cit\u2019s just a concert\u201d that\u2019s exactly the point.  You potentially tossed a friendship away for being some place an extra hour early.  how would you feel if she did it to you?", "Yta. Her delay wasn't going to make you late for doors opening to the show.", "YTA.\n\nYou could have hang out later, but going again with her friends to a Taylor Swift concert is very difficult to happen again and she wasn\u00b4t late because she was being lazy, it was because of her work.", "YTA\n\nYou could've waited and her mom telling you she hadn't been home yet should've been reason enough for you to wait a bit to hear from her. She didn't plan on working later, sometimes it just happens. \n\nIf it had gone over an hour then I could understand but <30 minutes ? Y'all got me fucked up. I wouldn't talk to y'all either LMAO. \n\nDid y'all even pay her back ?", "Of course YTA!", "YTA.   why couldn\u2019t she just meet you at the show?", "YTA. You knew Marissa had work and didn't communicate with her individually until the last minute. You should have made a plan beforehand to account for her work schedule. Leaving her behind without confirming if she had a way to get there was a dick move.", "YTA. And you're a crappy friend.", "YTA you couldn't turn around and pick her up? Or let her meet you there? Really? \n\nThe Eras tour is legit a historical event (I know that sounds dramatic but this tour is HUGE and she's getting close to being the next Michael Jackson). You took this away from her.\n\nI'd be shocked if she ever speaks to you again.", "YTA. You admit that you were getting there early to hangout, so it\u2019s not as if she was actually late to the concert. Not saying you should\u2019ve turned around and went back to get her, but you could have at least asked if she wanted to/could meet you guys there before you invited your sister instead.", "YTA\n\nYou could have waited, just didn\u2019t want to. Not like you would miss the concert.", "YTA you knew she was working as a server, servers cant just check their phones when they want to. Why didnt you go to her place of work instead? \n\nAlso, you start out by saying its happening in your city, and then you say you dont live close to the city?", "YTA. She was working hard to get there, she didn\u2019t even ask you guys to give her like 30 mins to get ready she was just gonna throw something on. She\u2019s been excited for this forever, and not everyone can just take a day off work. You all suck, except Marissa", "YTA, you\u2019re a shitty friend for that.", "YTA 30 mins is not a big deal if u didn\u2019t want to wait you could have told her to meet u guys wherever u we\u2019re headed.", "YTA and a huge one! If you wanted to loose a friend, congrats you have sealed the nail in that coffin. With friends like you, who needs enemies.", "YTA - Once she paid you for the ticket, it was no longer yours to give/sell away. It also sounds like she would have been able to make the actual concert, just not some of the hanging out.", "See this is a hard one but YTA.  Y'all wanted to get there early but didn't have the time to wait for someone who paid and waited SO LONG for that concert, just as you had. Yeah, you paid her back but that doesn't change how long you're friend was looking forward to that concert.", "YTA, obviously.", "YTA\n\nYou guys agreed to meet at 2:00 and you left at 2:10? That is really shitty. And the concert is only an hour away? Taylor Swift is not perform at 4 PM.\n\nN T A only if you waited as long as you possibly could without putting your attendance at risk. You knew she intended to come but things happen.\n\nHopefully, this experience with your sister was worth ruining a friendship over.", "This just all reads like you wanted to give the ticket to your sister from the start. Couldn't you have driven past her work? Did you say clearly that 2 would be a hard cutoff time?\n\nIt also doesn't sound like you even saved her ticket - she would have had plenty of time to get there by herself until 6. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. If she already paid for her ticket, then you stole it without her permission. Paying her later doesn\u2019t make it right.", "YTA\n\nDid calling her job, or even just stopping by, not cross any of your minds? You lack critical thinking", "Massive massive massive YTA. HUGE.", ">At around 1 I started texting everyone to get ready because I had to start picking people up.\n\nINFO...\n\nWhy did you need to text people day-of about the timing? Was this schedule not agreed upon ahead of time?\n\nWould you have been late if you turned around to pick up your friend?\n\nDid your friend have any other way to arrive at the concert on time?", "YTA !!! Would it have killed you to wait at her house for a bit? Just twenty minutes would have made a major difference. Not to mention the fact that you wouldn\u2019t have been late to the CONCERT regardless. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Marissa never spoke to you guys again\u2014 and rightfully so.", "YTA. She paid for the ticket. It was hers. You had them, and you were at her house. Couldn't you just leave her ticket there? If it is online, I am sure there was a way to give it to her too. You are one bad friend.", "Damn, gurl. You are **SOOOO** TA, as are Haley and Aiden. She already paid you for her ticket. You *knew* she got hung up at work and you *knew* she was still there because her mom told you she hadn't been home yet. Why didn't you just leave her ticket with her mother?

MINUTES.** For one of your \"besties\". *smh*\n\nThere are so many a$$hole-ish things about all of this. Bottom line, though, is that you are a truly horrible friend. I hope Marissa has some true friends in her life because y\"all ain't it.", "YTA", "YTA and your sister should have paid scalp ticket pricing. Those last minute tickets were going for many thousands of dollars. Can't even believe you don't know what a horrible thing you all did.

You gave away HER ticket away so you could go with your sister. Not to mention you went hours early. She could still have gone if you hadn\u2019t given her ticket away. I also deem it as theft because that ticket didn\u2019t belong to you. Your sister also owes her more money. If she had sold it that day then she\u2019d have gotten way more money that what your sister gave her. \n\nOn another note, a lot of workplaces do not allow you to use your phone. I don\u2019t care if your previous or current job allowed it. Fact is a fair amount do not. She did get in touch with you after and by then you were basically like sorry SOL. \n\nI hope you realize your friendship is definitely over. You have to deal with the consequences of your actions. I hope it was worth it.", "INFO: Did she know there was a backup and her ticket could get sold? How far ahead did you make the pan to leave at 2pm?", "YTA X100. So you couldn't have driven by her work to see what was up? No you did this on purpose because of your sister. And your other friends suck to for not stopping you. You not only owe her the money back, but I would try and get tickets at another venue for her to make up for your selfishness. Even your mom thinks YTA - so why are you asking here?", "YTA I know concerts don\u2019t started before 5 and since y\u2019all are driving, you could\u2019ve waited a bit more. You\u2019re a massive asshole. I hope nothing but bad luck and shit thing happens to you.", "YTA x13000. Doors open at 6 and Taylor doesn\u2019t even get on stage til 8. She wasn\u2019t late, you just wanted to be an asshole for no reason.

You could have to pay for her ticket to another show, so good luck.", "YTA. It's weird how other people define friend.", "YTA, you used the situation of her not picking up her calls to give away her ticket to your sister. You were there way too early. You had no right to give away a ticket someone else paid for. You still out here defending yourself against people even when your own mother thinks you're the worst friend ever. And i agree.

I really can\u2019t.", "Exactly.", "Your own mother thinks you\u2019re an asshole, but sure, think your friendship will recover. If your friend has any respect for herself, it won\u2019t.

Why would someone wanna be friends with you? Really, all of you guys are shitty and deserve each other. I don\u2019t even like Taylor, Swift, and I think the concerts are stupid, and I hate going to them, but it is painfully clear to me that you guys are horrible friends.", "It should.", "Oh I\u2019d never talk to you again.", "Come on.

This wasnt like a regular hang, this was a pre planned event.", "you dont think she wouldve if she had access to her phone?", "So why didn\u2019t you get the ticket to her family? Or drop it off for her at the restaurant? Or show up at her house?\n\nThose are all things a friend would do. \n\nSounds like you wanted your sister to go and you took the slightest excuse to take it.", "well you're friends with a bunch of assholes then I guess?", "So maybe she could have been an AH for that but then you went nuclear. Sold her ticket and left her behind. \n\nDo you even realize it wasnt your ticket to give away?", "OP, I hope you realise your friends would do this to you too.", "She. Was. At. Work.", "No it\u2019s on you for being a horrible friend. Taylor doesn\u2019t start singing until 8 PM, so you had PLENTY of time to wait for your friend.", "10 minutes. You waited 10 fucking minutes.

OH NOES.", "Your mom is right.", "You know some people have bills and can't afford to take off. Whatever the case, that delay would not make her late for the actual concert. True friends would understand that.", "YTA. Your mom is right. The big issue is not that you drove off without her. The big issue is that you gave away her ticket without her consent. She already paid for it. There was plenty of time for her to find an alternative transportation to the concert. You should not have given her ticket to your sister unless she explicitly confirms she could not go.", "Here\u2019s the thing she bought the ticket from you the moment she sent you the money. You no longer had any right over it. What you did is theft", "Even your mom thinks YTA.

I'm sure they would not like it if you did this to them.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if she paid her. It wasn\u2019t your ticket to sell.

When you make you backup plan, you decide for her that she would use the ticket", "YTA", "It wasn't YOUR ticket to give away, that's why you are 1000% YTA. She had already paid you for the ticket, that ticket was HERS - even if she had to catch an uber because you were too much of an asshole to wait fifteen minutes. Learn some fucking manners kid.

Not your ticket to give away.", "So\u2026 if you knew she had to work that day and might not get off in time to drive with you, why couldn\u2019t she still drive up separately? Why couldn\u2019t she have her ticket and just meet you there?", "So you gave away her ticket, which wasn\u2019t yours to give, without even waiting 15-20 minutes or so after the agreed upon departure time?\n\nAnd when gates weren\u2019t even opening for more than 2 hours from the time you left?

Be specific.", "Nah you right I was just trying to be kinda on the fence but this person is for sure the asshole, especially after planning this for a long time", "she was working  as a server, do you think she had the ability to respond in that moment?", "To be fair she was at work at a restaurant job, you can\u2019t exactly go on your phone when an emergency happens, you have to be understandable \n\nPlease apologize to her, she was likely looking forward to that concert just like you guys were. It just Eve been a betrayal for her friends since high school to do that to her.", "That\u2019s a flat out lie.\n\nWithin thirty minutes, you\u2019d already given the ticket away and got on the road.", "As long as \"we are leaving at 2\" was clear, NTA. \n\nEspecially with the failing to reply to texts.", "Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s the biggest act in the world or some indie artist no one has ever heard from.

I could get a ticket to Taylor Swift on credit and then work my ass off to pay it off. I'd still need to pick up as many shifts as I could for actual living costs and to make sure I had money for merch at the concert too. \n\nIf I had a shift in the morning and a concert in the evening I'd do the shift too, if I got lucky in tips that would pay for my food/drinks/merch that night.", "Did you ask her about this? You would have had time to have this conversation had you waited.", "You guess? It seems like you were just finding an excuse to leave her anyways, as you\u2019re not too sure of your own argument.

They were meeting ~four hours before the concert. Marissa could have arrived at any point before the doors opened without it impacting OP. OP is squarely in the wrong. It was not her ticket to sell.\n\nImagine a friend has something you bought. They give it away without permission. Are you going to be happy simply because you are made financially whole again? Or are you going to think your friend sucks for giving away *your stuff* that they had no right to give away?", "I could see Marissa being an AH for not responding to her texts/calls but OP just cut and ran before Marissa really had a chance to explain.", "She\u2019s not late a ton but it\u2019s not surprising that she fucked up the whole call off of work thing", "So? I find it hard to believe Ticketmaster has not considered such a situation or the need for someone to sell and transfer a ticket to another individual.", "That\u2019s a whooooole lot of mental gymnastics when it\u2019s far more likely that she\u2019s doing okay for herself", "It was 230 when she started to call so it was 2 and a half hours we had zero contact from her", "Skynet lol", "I can see that. But I\u2019m hung up on Marissa saying she would be done at Noon. So at some point Marissa would have been getting ready to leave and get sucked back in, which does happen. However it\u2019s odd to me at that point she went two and a half hours no contact after breaking a deadline she set herself for being off work. \n\nThe OP sister thing seems to convenient. ESH is my take.", "Because the concert was at night and she works in the morning?", "Do you know she could afford to? Maybe this was her rent money or her merch money.", "Hey OP thanks for responding. Can you clarify what you mean by call off of work? My understanding was she had to work and committed to being off at Noon. But call off sounds like she was planning on calling in sick/using a reason to not show up for a shift?", "Why are you arguing with me? Go ask OP or go look up how the app works.", "Its really not. 20 year old living in the chicago suburbs working as a breakfast server likely isnt rolling in dough.", "And? Did she say why she wasn\u2019t able to answer her phone?", "You\u2019re trying to make it sound much bigger than it is, it was 30 minutes until she contacted you after the time you plan to leave by. 30 minutes did not put you at risk for not making it to the concert.\n\nYou can respond to his many messages as you want, you\u2019re clearly still the asshole", "OP is still making excuses in the comments. That almost absolves Marissa in my eyes.", "Not call off but just request off in advance. I told my boss for a few months I wouldn\u2019t be able to work that day.", "I\u2019m not arguing? Because you said it wasn\u2019t her ticket to give away. So why was she the one in possession of it rather than the owner of it.", "Yeah I responded to OP to dig deeper. Something doesn\u2019t feel right. \n\nThe swifties have amassed into a swarm though. This is kind of amazing. Like a video of a bee hive melting a hornet that broke in.", "It wasnt hers to give away because Marissa paid her for it\u2026 but have you ever bought concert tickets? If you want seats together one person would buy them and the tickets will be on their account. \n\nYou can transfer the tickets to someone if they have a Ticketmaster account", "She was supposed to be done around 12. There were 2 hours where she just didn\u2019t respond and we had absolutely no clue what was going on with her. We all were calling and texting", "Im a recent convert and I have to say, I\u2019m here for this post.", "So\u2026 once Marissa knew she didn\u2019t have the day off she could have considered the necessity of a back up plan and had OP transfer the ticket to her in case she needed to meet them there. That way, OP is no longer in possession of it. Which would mean she could never have made a back up plan with her sister, her sister would have to make that deal with Marissa if it came to that. She was able to transfer her money easily enough. That doesn\u2019t mean Marissa is to blame but it does raise the importance within this friend group of being responsible for your own ticket, etc rather than entrusting it to someone else.", "Gotcha. So I\u2019ll be honest you all suck here. Marissa for her terrible time management and committing to 12 but then not notifying anyone in the 2 hours. A lot of people are hung up on \u201cwell what if she couldn\u2019t use her phone\u201d but to me there would have been a point before noon where she realized she wasn\u2019t going to make it that she could have alerted everyone. \n\nHowever, it really seems like you just wanted to give your sister the ticket. Even if that\u2019s not true, you gotta understand the optics look bad.", "My post or OP?", "YTA. This is such a mean girl move.

She was 30 minutes late to a meetup time that is like what... 4 hours early to the concert? So she still has PLENTY of time to get to the venue and meet you all there. Sure, she'd probably miss out on some of the pre-concert festivities but that's probably fine. PLUS it's her ticket you're holding - you can't just sell it to someone else because it's not yours. Just screenshot the QR code and send it to her and say you are heading out, but meet you'll meet her there. Yea, she was MIA for a bit, but she was at work! Idk if you work or not but stuff happens at work at the drop of a dime and you just get busy and can't do anything else.\n\nEven AFTER you sold the ticket to your sister, you still could have backtracked and said you reached Marissa and looks like she can make it. Your sister (if she's not an AH) would have understood that. And if she bitched to you and you made your AITA post about THAT, the verdict would probably be N T A.\n\nI just can't get over you ditching her and selling her ticket and she wasn't even late. I have held tickets for friends that weren't even there by the time the movie/concert/show started. Lol. Wtf. Also, this is one of the hottest shows in like... history. Not surprised she doesn't talk to any of you any more. I feel like you all treat Marissa as 'that' friend where for whatever reason, nobody really wants her there, so you were just looking for ANY excuse to ditch her. \n\nAlso, real nice move with putting in that you all had a blast while your friend is missing out due to you screwing her over. No guilt whatsoever. This is so insane that I almost feel like this is fake. Nobody can be this clueless right?", "Wow YTA If someone stole a Taylor Swift concert ticket from me I would definitely do more than just cut you off.", "YTA- OP has continually not answered why she didn\u2019t send the ticket and let Marissa drive herself. Hasn\u2019t answered why it was so important to be that early. My biggest question is why didn\u2019t u just call the place she works at when not getting ahold of her phone. Then it\u2019s how u that u had the right to sell something that doesn\u2019t belong to u? Another why was your sister contacted and on her way so quickly and why u couldn\u2019t say hey sorry she called and it is her ticket? I hope u guys weren\u2019t super close bc u might have lost her and I\u2019m sure u so easily dismissing her and her feelings hurt worse than missing a concert. As my grandma always told me don\u2019t do to others what u wouldn\u2019t want done to u. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be upset if her sister sent u some cash and had a blast with your friends on your ticket after already having a dumpster day at work.

You\u2019re the Ticketmaster of friends.", "Info: If you had been having phone issues and were running 20 minutes late picking everyone up, would you have been upset if they sold your ticket a few minutes after the time you were supposed to arrive?", "JFC you already know YTA Why bother to post? Your ex-friend just saw y'alls true colors..Friends like you? Who needs enemies?", "OP, you're not understanding the situation here and what everyone is trying to tell you. As soon as she purchased it, the ticket was hers. If she couldn't make the concert at all and the seat sat empty, that sucks for her but it's her money and her prerogative. IT WAS NOT YOURS TO GIVE AWAY. *Even if* you reimbursed her.\n\nI seriously hope she takes you to small claims court.

Your a shit friend.\n\nIt would\u2019ve been different if the concert started at 2 but it starts at 7 where I am. And especially a Taylor Swift concert? When she hasn\u2019t been on tour for the past 4 years? And tickets are in high demand and expensive to get? Your friend was excited, and had an issue at work, and instead of sending her ticket and telling her to meet you there (assuming the tickets are digital) you just fucking ditched her?

You were going to Soldier Field in downtown Chicago. You live an hour out of the city. You could have waited for her. Parking sucks but you had plenty of time.", "YTA. This is fucked up. You gave away her ticket? You knew she was at work. You just happened to call your sister that wanted to go. You totally dogged her. There is no way to excuse it.", "Ok, number one, Eric Cartman did this for a trip to Casa Bonita and it didn\u2019t work out great. \n\nNumber two, you had a blast?? How did this terrible, awkward thing between you and your friend not out a major damper on the whole thing? Your ability to just not care is\u2026sad and telling. \n\nYTA.", "YTA, why post of you're not going to accept the judgment, like you are terrible friends and you clearly don't care about what you did. Why did you post for validation? You're not going to get it here. \n\nThe plan was to leave ridiculously early, fine, whatever. \n\nShe was working she couldn't answer her phone, all you had to do was transfer her ticket to her, 2:30 is still plenty of time for her to get to the actual concert. 5pm would've been enough time for her to get there. \n\nYou didn't hear from her, so what, that was her ticket, she paid for it, it wasn't right for you to decide that you could transfer it to your sister, just because something is legal doesn't mean it's correct/right. Just because you can doesn't mean she should. If my friend and I had plans and I KNEW she was working I would've just emailed her the ticket and been like hope to see you there, if she doesn't make it and ends up losing money, now it's on her, but I'm not just going to not even give her HER ticket. She paid for it, it was not yours to sell. \n\nLike why was it ok for your sister to meet you there but not Marissa. This all seems so shady.\n\n\nYou are all horrible friends, but sometimes it takes big things like this for people to show you who you are. You guys showed Marissa what her place/value is in your lives, and she now knows she needs new and better friends. \n\nI just laugh bc ironically Taylor Swift probably wouldn't be fan of how you treat your friends... I'm just curious how much we're the tickets so I can know exactly how much a friendship is worth to you?", "Not only YTA, you are also a shitty friend.", "YTA. This is just gross.", "YTA. If you were in such a rush to leave at 2pm the absolute minimum you could have done for a friend is to leave the ticket which SHE PAID FOR with her mum and she could catch up later. You didn't even try. No wonder you haven't heard from Marissa, with friends like you who needs enimies", "Omg OP\nI'm impressed you need to ask\nYTA", "You wanted to give her ticket away. You could have given her the ticket and said meet us there. You are the asshole. She\u2019s probably not going to be friends with you all and I don\u2019t blame her.

She got off in time to make to the show, just not be there for the entire meet up before concert. That ticket was her property and you had no right to re-sell it without her permission. Try being a better friend and person.", "Definitely YTA for a few reasons.\n\n1. You knew your friend was at work. She's in the service industry, and generally they're not allowed to use their phones while they're working, so you shouldn't expect a response.\n\n2. You were already heading to the concert way early. Waiting 30 minutes wouldn't have made you miss the concert, which is the main reason you were going.\n\n3. This is my biggest reason why YTA. You may have initially purchased the tickets, but your friend paid you for that ticket. That makes the ticket hers, and you have no right to sell it without her consent. It doesn't matter if your sister sent her the money, your friend did not give you permission to sell it in the first place. If your sister wanted to go so bad, she should've gotten a ticket and paid what was being asked or asked you to get her one when you were initially purchasing. You can't sell something to someone else that doesn't belong to you.", "YTA \n\nWhy do you keep trying to deflect blame for being a thief? You stole from her for your sister. That ticket was worth many times its face value, AND YOU KNEW IT, so that's what she's owed, not face value. \n\nYou were literally at her house and could have left the ticket that belonged to her, but you thought you'd be cute and just steal it instead. You're despicable.", "YTA. She could actually sue you for that. Wtf.", "Can you imagine being SO EXCITED to go to a Taylor Swift concert after what seemed to be a shitty day at work for Marissa, only to have your friend say you\u2019re no longer going after they sold the ticket you bought. \n\nYTA", "YTA- I get leaving her behind if she was late and hadn\u2019t communicated with anyone, but selling her ticket without her consent was completely out of line.", "YTA", "YTA. You said it yourself. She had paid for the ticket. Therefore it was not yours to sell.", "YTA. A huge hemorrhoidal one. I would never speak to you again either. She had every right to be angry. Y\u2019all knew exactly where she was.", "YTA as are the rest of the friend group. But you know that don't you? You sacrificed your friend(ship) and screwed her over because your sister wanted to go to the concert. This wasn't an if we don't leave now, we'll all miss the show moment.  You had a cushion of hours.", "I truly hope she sues you in small claims court and reports you to the cops for theft.
