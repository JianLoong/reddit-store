We were planning on getting there pretty early to hangout for a bit. Everyone knew this plan for a long time but for some reason Marissa couldn\u2019t/didn\u2019t get off work. She is a server at a breakfast restaurant and normally doesn\u2019t work too late. This was all on Saturday btw. \n\nI also have an older sister who lives in this city who really wanted to go but couldn\u2019t. She begged me to be a backup in case anything happened. We don\u2019t live very close to the city (like an hour drive sometimes longer) so we planned on leaving at 2 PM.\n\nAt around 1 I started texting everyone to get ready because I had to start picking people up. Marissa told us she should get off around 12 but she didn\u2019t say anything when I texted the group. I texted her individually and called her. No response. I started picking up everyone and she was the last person to get. I kept calling and we waited outside her house for a bit, I said fuck it so I went to the door. Her answered and said Marissa has not come home yet. Together we decided to leave without her. \n\nWe got 20 minutes into the drive when all our phones started blowing up. It was Marissa apologizing and saying there was issues at work and she had to stay but she\u2019s speeding home and will be ready in 15 minutes. It was like 230 at this point. \n\nAiden called her and explained what happened and I could hear her screaming her head off at him. He eventually hung up on her. My sister met us there and zelle\u2019d the money to Marissa in the exact amount she paid me.

You had PLENTY OF TIME to wait. \n\nAll you had to do was stay at her house for a few minutes but instead you drove off like you were in a getaway car and now you have bad blood. Why\u2019d you have to be so mean?", "Wow. YTA. And I would never want to be friends with you or your group. She paid for her ticket. You couldn\u2019t have transferred her ticket to her (most tickets are e-tickets nowadays anyway) and said \u201chey sorry, we left but here\u2019s your ticket - meet us there\u201d?? That\u2019s such a shitty thing to do. Especially for a Taylor swift show when you know tickets are impossible to find and it will probably be a couple of years before she tours again. I don\u2019t blame Marisa for cutting all of you off completely.", "YTA. Once she paid you, that was her ticket. You don\u2019t get to give it away if she wasn\u2019t consulted prior. You were so early. You would have been able to wait for like 20 minutes longer. Or you could have asked her to get there herself if you felt that you absolutely had to leave that time. There were options!!!", "INFO: it sounds like your sister drove separately and met you at the venue; why was this not an option you gave Marissa?\n\nAlso, what time was the concert scheduled & what time did you actually get there?\n\nDid y'all call her work or stop by to see why she was held up?", "YTA. Sooooooo TA. It was not your ticket. She paid for it. It was hers. You had no right!\n\nHow long did you wait to let your sister steal her ticket? Why couldn\u2019t she be given the option to meet you there? Did you even _try_ to figure out how to get her there? Stop by her work with clothes so she could change on the way? Give one single damn about her? Of course not because you wanted sister to go more. What a horrible friend all of you are.", "YTA. You killed a friendship for 30mins. You were still A FEW HOURS early for the show.", "YTA. I think you were anxious to give the ticket to your sister. You knew she was at work. One of ya could\u2019ve called her work or tried harder. That was a shitty think to do.", "Yta. That was her ticket. I could see someone taking it at the last minute, but hours early?\n\nYou guys are atrocious friends and she deserves better.", "YTA if she paid you. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m confused about the timeline. 2:30 seems pretty early to go to a concert.", "YTA\n\nIt wasn't your ticket to give away. Given that you wanted to hang out before the concert even started, her delay wouldn't have harmed you.", "YTA - I\u2019m obnoxious about being on time but good lord, for an event like this you could have made an exception. The concert wasn\u2019t going to start at 3. You had more than enough time. I wouldn\u2019t be talking to either.", "YTA: not your tix to sell to begin with plain and simple.", "YTA. She would not have been late for the concert, you guys were all early by hours. She was delayed for 30 minutes, there would have still been time to hang out. The money was probably nothing compared to how excited she was to see the concert and be with her friends. You may have just ruined this friendship.", "You guys are too old to be dealing out this much immaturity. Like dude.. you're 20.", "Do you know how hard it is to come by a Taylor swift concert ticket?! And you couldn\u2019t go back even though you would\u2019ve been at the show still hours early????

She called you at 2.30pm. When you had already given your sister the ticket - 30 minutes earlier.\n\nYou gave her ticket away at 2pm. The time you were supposed to collect her.\n\nThere was no wait time. You gave her ticket away when she hadn\u2019t even been 10 minutes late.\n\nWhen you knew you were going to arrive 4 hours before the doors even opened. It wasn\u2019t yours to \u201csell\u201d and then you sold it for the face price?\n\nIf Melissa couldn\u2019t go it was her right to sell it at the best possible price - you scammed her out of hundreds of dollars. So yes, you stole her property and scammed her.\n\nYTA.\n\nYou haven\u2019t lost your friendship - you sold it out. You willingly trashed it.", "YTA because it wasn\u2019t your ticket to give away. She paid for that ticket so I can only imagine the absolute disappointment and anger she felt when she found out you just gave it away after only 30 MINUTES of her not responding - and you guys knew her whereabouts so she wasn\u2019t just bailing. Even though you refunded her, it\u2019s still so messed up. \u201cWe had a blast\u201d shows your lack of care and I honestly hope she cuts you all off for good.", "YTA. She paid for the ticket, you had NO RIGHT to substitute someone without Marissa green-lighting it first. You\u2019re terrible friends.", "You're all absolutely TA. You knew she was at work. If it was 230, that's *several* hours before the concert starts. I can't even believe you're bothering to come to Reddit to ask, because the answer is so obvious.", "Info\n\nWhy didn't you, idk, not just DRIVE to the restaurant to check on her?!", "I hope you never have anything unexpected happen to you only to find your friends don\u2019t think you\u2019re important enough to a. either find out what\u2019s going on or b. wait for you when you had plans.  You could easily have gone to her work or waited until she got home bc you had more than enough time, but you didn\u2019t bc you wanted your sister to go.  Hope you gave her the money back at least. \n\nYTA and a shitty friend. If I was Marissa I\u2019d be done w this friendship bc you\u2019ve shown your true colors. ETA-before you say \u201cit\u2019s just a concert\u201d that\u2019s exactly the point.  You potentially tossed a friendship away for being some place an extra hour early.  how would you feel if she did it to you?", "Yta. Her delay wasn't going to make you late for doors opening to the show.", "YTA.\n\nYou could have hang out later, but going again with her friends to a Taylor Swift concert is very difficult to happen again and she wasn\u00b4t late because she was being lazy, it was because of her work.", "YTA\n\nYou could've waited and her mom telling you she hadn't been home yet should've been reason enough for you to wait a bit to hear from her. She didn't plan on working later, sometimes it just happens. \n\nIf it had gone over an hour then I could understand but <30 minutes ? Y'all got me fucked up. I wouldn't talk to y'all either LMAO. \n\nDid y'all even pay her back ?", "Of course YTA!", "YTA.   why couldn\u2019t she just meet you at the show?", "YTA. You knew Marissa had work and didn't communicate with her individually until the last minute. You should have made a plan beforehand to account for her work schedule. Leaving her behind without confirming if she had a way to get there was a dick move.", "YTA. And you're a crappy friend.", "YTA you couldn't turn around and pick her up? Or let her meet you there? Really? \n\nThe Eras tour is legit a historical event (I know that sounds dramatic but this tour is HUGE and she's getting close to being the next Michael Jackson). You took this away from her.\n\nI'd be shocked if she ever speaks to you again.", "YTA. You admit that you were getting there early to hangout, so it\u2019s not as if she was actually late to the concert. Not saying you should\u2019ve turned around and went back to get her, but you could have at least asked if she wanted to/could meet you guys there before you invited your sister instead.", "YTA\n\nYou could have waited, just didn\u2019t want to. Not like you would miss the concert.", "YTA you knew she was working as a server, servers cant just check their phones when they want to. Why didnt you go to her place of work instead? \n\nAlso, you start out by saying its happening in your city, and then you say you dont live close to the city?", "YTA. She was working hard to get there, she didn\u2019t even ask you guys to give her like 30 mins to get ready she was just gonna throw something on. She\u2019s been excited for this forever, and not everyone can just take a day off work. You all suck, except Marissa", "YTA, you\u2019re a shitty friend for that.", "YTA 30 mins is not a big deal if u didn\u2019t want to wait you could have told her to meet u guys wherever u we\u2019re headed.", "YTA and a huge one! If you wanted to loose a friend, congrats you have sealed the nail in that coffin. With friends like you, who needs enemies.", "YTA - Once she paid you for the ticket, it was no longer yours to give/sell away. It also sounds like she would have been able to make the actual concert, just not some of the hanging out.", "See this is a hard one but YTA.  Y'all wanted to get there early but didn't have the time to wait for someone who paid and waited SO LONG for that concert, just as you had. Yeah, you paid her back but that doesn't change how long you're friend was looking forward to that concert.", "YTA, obviously.", "YTA\n\nYou guys agreed to meet at 2:00 and you left at 2:10? That is really shitty. And the concert is only an hour away? Taylor Swift is not perform at 4 PM.\n\nN T A only if you waited as long as you possibly could without putting your attendance at risk. You knew she intended to come but things happen.\n\nHopefully, this experience with your sister was worth ruining a friendship over.", "This just all reads like you wanted to give the ticket to your sister from the start. Couldn't you have driven past her work? Did you say clearly that 2 would be a hard cutoff time?\n\nIt also doesn't sound like you even saved her ticket - she would have had plenty of time to get there by herself until 6. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. If she already paid for her ticket, then you stole it without her permission. Paying her later doesn\u2019t make it right.", "YTA\n\nDid calling her job, or even just stopping by, not cross any of your minds? You lack critical thinking", "Massive massive massive YTA. HUGE.", ">At around 1 I started texting everyone to get ready because I had to start picking people up.\n\nINFO...\n\nWhy did you need to text people day-of about the timing? Was this schedule not agreed upon ahead of time?\n\nWould you have been late if you turned around to pick up your friend?\n\nDid your friend have any other way to arrive at the concert on time?", "YTA !!! Would it have killed you to wait at her house for a bit? Just twenty minutes would have made a major difference. Not to mention the fact that you wouldn\u2019t have been late to the CONCERT regardless. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Marissa never spoke to you guys again\u2014 and rightfully so.", "YTA. She paid for the ticket. It was hers. You had them, and you were at her house. Couldn't you just leave her ticket there? If it is online, I am sure there was a way to give it to her too. You are one bad friend.", "Damn, gurl. You are **SOOOO** TA, as are Haley and Aiden. She already paid you for her ticket. You *knew* she got hung up at work and you *knew* she was still there because her mom told you she hadn't been home yet. Why didn't you just leave her ticket with her mother? Or transfer it to her electronically? Why didn't you drive to the restaurant to check on her? \n\n>We got 20 minutes into the drive when all our phones started blowing up. It was Marissa apologizing and saying there was issues at work and she had to stay but she\u2019s speeding home and will be ready in 15 minutes.

MINUTES.** For one of your \"besties\". *smh*\n\nThere are so many a$$hole-ish things about all of this. Bottom line, though, is that you are a truly horrible friend. I hope Marissa has some true friends in her life because y\"all ain't it.", "YTA", "YTA and your sister should have paid scalp ticket pricing. Those last minute tickets were going for many thousands of dollars. Can't even believe you don't know what a horrible thing you all did. Maybe Taylor will read this and do the girl a solid and write a song about shit friends.", "YTA. With friends like you, who needs enemies. \n\nStop trying to justify what you did. You gave away HER ticket away so you could go with your sister. Not to mention you went hours early. She could still have gone if you hadn\u2019t given her ticket away. I also deem it as theft because that ticket didn\u2019t belong to you. Your sister also owes her more money. If she had sold it that day then she\u2019d have gotten way more money that what your sister gave her. \n\nOn another note, a lot of workplaces do not allow you to use your phone. I don\u2019t care if your previous or current job allowed it. Fact is a fair amount do not. She did get in touch with you after and by then you were basically like sorry SOL. \n\nI hope you realize your friendship is definitely over. You have to deal with the consequences of your actions. I hope it was worth it.", "INFO: Did she know there was a backup and her ticket could get sold? How far ahead did you make the pan to leave at 2pm?", "YTA X100. So you couldn't have driven by her work to see what was up? No you did this on purpose because of your sister. And your other friends suck to for not stopping you. You not only owe her the money back, but I would try and get tickets at another venue for her to make up for your selfishness. Even your mom thinks YTA - so why are you asking here?", "YTA I know concerts don\u2019t started before 5 and since y\u2019all are driving, you could\u2019ve waited a bit more. You\u2019re a massive asshole. I hope nothing but bad luck and shit thing happens to you.", "YTA x13000. Doors open at 6 and Taylor doesn\u2019t even get on stage til 8. She wasn\u2019t late, you just wanted to be an asshole for no reason. Hope she gets to meet Taylor someday cuz she deserves it after putting up with \u201cfriends\u201d like you guys.", "INFO: how long between when you purchased the tickets and the concert was there?

It's weird how other people define friend.", "YTA, you used the situation of her not picking up her calls to give away her ticket to your sister. You were there way too early.

This was super mean behaviour from you, you wouldn't be my friend any more", "Even if she does tour again, that doesn't change the fact that you basically stole her ticket.", "That\u2019s not the point.", "I truly cannot wrap my brain around this. I really can\u2019t.", "Exactly.", "Your own mother thinks you\u2019re an asshole, but sure, think your friendship will recover. If your friend has any respect for herself, it won\u2019t. You are an asshole. It was not your ticket to sell.", "How would you feel about you if you were Marissa right now? You took away months of excitement and a possibility once in a lifetime opportunity because you were impatient. \n\nThis is a good lesson in realising that sorry doesn\u2019t fix everything and some things can\u2019t be undone.", "Oh, it totally killed it. Friends don\u2019t do things like this. You worry. You help. You figure shit out TOGETHER.", "It did. If you don\u2019t know anything, know that. That was a shitty thing you decided to do, and without her consent.", "lmfaooooo you\u2019re delusional if you think you\u2019re still friends", "I certainly hope that it does, she deserves so much better.", "Imagine someone sold your ticket, that you owned and paid in full for, 5 hours before the concert, because you were stuck at work and couldn\u2019t get to your phone for a half hour? When you could just get in your car meet them there?  Would you stay friends with that person?", "You\u2019re a shit friend.", "it did. what do you expect from her? she paid her tickets, if she attend or not, it would be her choice. you could have left without her but you should not have given /sold her ticket away. she is better without you as a friend. you are not a friend.", "I hope Marissa gets better friends than y\u2019all", "You stole someone's ticket. She was working and unable to answer her phone. If someone did that to me, I would drop that friendship. No one deserves to be treated the way you treated her.", "If people did this to you, would you still be friends with them?", "It absolutely did. You are the shittiest friend ever. Why would someone wanna be friends with you? Really, all of you guys are shitty and deserve each other. I don\u2019t even like Taylor, Swift, and I think the concerts are stupid, and I hate going to them, but it is painfully clear to me that you guys are horrible friends.", "It should.", "Oh I\u2019d never talk to you again.", "Come on. Do you really think she was just gonna ghost you for this? A cup of coffee, maybe. Not a concert even this metal head can\u2019t avoid hearing about.", "She was at work. Are you able to just respond to your friends texts and phone calls any time during your work day without exception, or are there times when you comply can't answer the phone?", "As mentioned before SHE WAS AT WORK", "So why didnt you swing by her work - you knew where she was. This wasnt like a regular hang, this was a pre planned event.", "you dont think she wouldve if she had access to her phone?", "So why didn\u2019t you get the ticket to her family? Or drop it off for her at the restaurant? Or show up at her house?\n\nThose are all things a friend would do. \n\nSounds like you wanted your sister to go and you took the slightest excuse to take it.", "well you're friends with a bunch of assholes then I guess?", "So maybe she could have been an AH for that but then you went nuclear. Sold her ticket and left her behind. \n\nDo you even realize it wasnt your ticket to give away?", "OP, I hope you realise your friends would do this to you too.", "She. Was. At. Work.", "No it\u2019s on you for being a horrible friend. Taylor doesn\u2019t start singing until 8 PM, so you had PLENTY of time to wait for your friend.", "10 minutes. You waited 10 fucking minutes. It\u2019s not like she put you at risk for missing the concert. \n\nIf she was MIA for a significant period of time, and it was starting to jeopardize all, if you guys making it on time, it was totally justifiable for you to leave \n\nBut NOT to give away her ticket. It wasn\u2019t yours to give away. It didn\u2019t belong to you. \n\nIf she wanted, she could probably sue you for theft and win. I hope she does.", "Have you ever had a job? Where you're at the mercy of your coworkers showing up, management being up your ass, and *gasp* not being allowed to be glued to your personal phone for hours on end? I'm guessing not since you dumped your friend for BEING AT WORK AND NOT ANSWERING HER PHONE for a whole thirty (or more) minutes. OH NOES.", "Your mom is right.", "You know some people have bills and can't afford to take off. Whatever the case, that delay would not make her late for the actual concert. True friends would understand that.", "YTA. Your mom is right. The big issue is not that you drove off without her. The big issue is that you gave away her ticket without her consent. She already paid for it. There was plenty of time for her to find an alternative transportation to the concert. You should not have given her ticket to your sister unless she explicitly confirms she could not go.", "Here\u2019s the thing she bought the ticket from you the moment she sent you the money. You no longer had any right over it. What you did is theft", "Even your mom thinks YTA. Think about that.", "You are definitely the worst friend ever.\n\nYou only waited 10 minutes to see if she would show up.  10 minutes!! that is absolute bullshit", "Anybody who agrees with your actions is also an AH. I'm sure they would not like it if you did this to them.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if she paid her. It wasn\u2019t your ticket to sell. Imagine your friend has something that belongs to you, that you already paid for, and then they give it away to someone else. Are you going to be happy that your possession is gone simply because you\u2019re made financially whole again? Or are you going to be pissed because someone gave away your stuff that they had no right to do?", "Who told you your sister got to set the price ? It wasn\u2019t your ticket to sell. YTA", "Paid her the exact amount she paid for the ticket - the ticket would have been worth a lot more if Marissa had actually been unable to make it and decided to resell.", "Did your sister pay her what she would've gotten had she sold the tickets the day of? Otherwise not only did you screw her over, *you stole from her...* Many hundreds if not thousands of dollars.\n\nI hope she deletes your contact information and blocks you everywhere. Trash friend. Worse, it feels intentional to get your sister in.\n\nYTA \n\nMassively.", "It was still theft.\n\nShe already paid you for something.  It no longer belong to you.  It was not yours to sell.  Even if she paid for it, and ultimately wasted it, it\u2019s still belongs to her and not to you.", "You and your friends and you sister need to make a plan to pay the real price for ticket... This isn't a matter of reimbursement if your friend had selled it she could have make way more money... So to me you stole her.\n\nAnd more, if she would have found some one to make the trip with her after you got out, she would have the right to use the ticket... When you make you backup plan, you decide for her that she would use the ticket", "YTA", "It wasn't YOUR ticket to give away, that's why you are 1000% YTA. She had already paid you for the ticket, that ticket was HERS - even if she had to catch an uber because you were too much of an asshole to wait fifteen minutes. Learn some fucking manners kid. YOU STOLE FROM HER. Not just the ticket, but the experience.", "so before making the effort to find out what was going on, you called your sister?", "You knew she was at work. You said so yourself.", "Let me guess the concert didn\u2019t start at 3:30 or 4 PM did it? I\u2019ve never seen a concert start before six or 7 PM. \n\nYTA", "I notice that you keep avoiding answering why you didn't go to her work.", "Doesn\u2019t matter. Not your ticket to give away.", "So\u2026 if you knew she had to work that day and might not get off in time to drive with you, why couldn\u2019t she still drive up separately? Why couldn\u2019t she have her ticket and just meet you there?", "So you gave away her ticket, which wasn\u2019t yours to give, without even waiting 15-20 minutes or so after the agreed upon departure time?\n\nAnd when gates weren\u2019t even opening for more than 2 hours from the time you left? And concert not starting for another 4+ hours? \n\nLeaving her behind to find another ride is one thing, but giving away her ticket absolutely makes you a huge AH.", "Could she AFFORD to ask though?", "Like how much time? Be specific.", "Nah you right I was just trying to be kinda on the fence but this person is for sure the asshole, especially after planning this for a long time", "she was working  as a server, do you think she had the ability to respond in that moment?", "To be fair she was at work at a restaurant job, you can\u2019t exactly go on your phone when an emergency happens, you have to be understandable \n\nPlease apologize to her, she was likely looking forward to that concert just like you guys were. It just Eve been a betrayal for her friends since high school to do that to her.", "That\u2019s a flat out lie.\n\nWithin thirty minutes, you\u2019d already given the ticket away and got on the road.", "As long as \"we are leaving at 2\" was clear, NTA. \n\nEspecially with the failing to reply to texts.", "Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s the biggest act in the world or some indie artist no one has ever heard from. OP is in the wrong.", "[deleted]", "\u201cJust\u201d mad she says \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Shitty friends", "I legit clicked on this post because I knew people would be up in arms. The amount of scathing comments did not disappoint. \n\nI would never go to this concert, but you'd have to be living under a rock in a cave \nunder the sea not to know this tour is a Huge Thing.", "I mean, if Marissa already paid for the ticket I don\u2019t understand why it wasn\u2019t in her possession so if she had to drive to the concert separately she was still in the clear? Better late than never. I don\u2019t understand why once it was paid for OP still had possession of anyone\u2019s ticket but her own.", "I kind of hope they DO do the same thing to her.", "Marissa needs to get the resale price from Sister. I'd be extremely unforgiving if I had a ticket stolen from me and got a fraction of what it was truly worth in the end. All so the little thief's sister could go. Op YTA and a thief.", "That\u2019s so true! What if she found another way to get there or drove herself? OP just took that opportunity away from her as if it was her right to do it!", "I like when the AH keep getting AH-ier \ud83e\udd23", "I mean she can afford a Taylor swift ticket\u2026", "I\u2019ve worked in a restaurant before and there\u2019s so many ways to take a phone out for 5 seconds and send a text. Go in the kitchen, walk in, bathroom or something it\u2019s not hard to send one text in like a 2 hour period", "Obviously we didn\u2019t want to leave her but we had to go I guess", "Bullshit. It was the other person\u2019s ticket. Showing up four hours early is not a requirement.", "failing to reply to texts? She was working at her server job, but OP couldnt even be bothered to go there first and find out what was happening.", "Life happens though.", "Eh, I personally think they all suck. But we are missing some key info: namely is Marissa\u2019s poor time management on this a one off or a habit. One off: OP sucks. Habit: Marissa sucks.", "The girl was at work. Obviously the situation didn\u2019t allow her to get to her phone. This wasn\u2019t like she was doing something and lost track of the time or that she overslept.", "And  she could have met you there.   I'm sure the concert didn't start at 4pm", "Likely they were just all on OPs Ticketmaster app.", "Yeah, at the very least, sister owes Marissa what that ticket would have cost from a scalper six hours before the show.", "Yeah, but only if she works enough shifts to. I could get a ticket to Taylor Swift on credit and then work my ass off to pay it off. I'd still need to pick up as many shifts as I could for actual living costs and to make sure I had money for merch at the concert too. \n\nIf I had a shift in the morning and a concert in the evening I'd do the shift too, if I got lucky in tips that would pay for my food/drinks/merch that night.", "Did you ask her about this? You would have had time to have this conversation had you waited.", "You guess? It seems like you were just finding an excuse to leave her anyways, as you\u2019re not too sure of your own argument. Personally I would\u2019ve waited for her and if I was at the concert late, so be it. If my friends and I were that dedicated we would\u2019ve waited", "I find it hard to believe you \"had to go\" when you were a few hours early", "Unless skynet took over the car and drove you there against your will, you had a choice.", "No you didn't. Assholes.", "But you didn\u2019t just leave her. YOU GAVE AWAY HER TICKET. That\u2019s much different than just leaving her to find her own ride.", "Marissa had already paid for the tickets. They were meeting ~four hours before the concert. Marissa could have arrived at any point before the doors opened without it impacting OP. OP is squarely in the wrong. It was not her ticket to sell.\n\nImagine a friend has something you bought. They give it away without permission. Are you going to be happy simply because you are made financially whole again? Or are you going to think your friend sucks for giving away *your stuff* that they had no right to give away?", "I could see Marissa being an AH for not responding to her texts/calls but OP just cut and ran before Marissa really had a chance to explain.", "She\u2019s not late a ton but it\u2019s not surprising that she fucked up the whole call off of work thing", "So? I find it hard to believe Ticketmaster has not considered such a situation or the need for someone to sell and transfer a ticket to another individual.", "That\u2019s a whooooole lot of mental gymnastics when it\u2019s far more likely that she\u2019s doing okay for herself", "It was 230 when she started to call so it was 2 and a half hours we had zero contact from her", "Skynet lol", "I can see that. But I\u2019m hung up on Marissa saying she would be done at Noon. So at some point Marissa would have been getting ready to leave and get sucked back in, which does happen. However it\u2019s odd to me at that point she went two and a half hours no contact after breaking a deadline she set herself for being off work. \n\nThe OP sister thing seems to convenient. ESH is my take.", "Because the concert was at night and she works in the morning?", "Do you know she could afford to? Maybe this was her rent money or her merch money.", "Hey OP thanks for responding. Can you clarify what you mean by call off of work? My understanding was she had to work and committed to being off at Noon. But call off sounds like she was planning on calling in sick/using a reason to not show up for a shift?", "Why are you arguing with me? Go ask OP or go look up how the app works.", "Its really not. 20 year old living in the chicago suburbs working as a breakfast server likely isnt rolling in dough.", "And? Did she say why she wasn\u2019t able to answer her phone?", "You\u2019re trying to make it sound much bigger than it is, it was 30 minutes until she contacted you after the time you plan to leave by. 30 minutes did not put you at risk for not making it to the concert.\n\nYou can respond to his many messages as you want, you\u2019re clearly still the asshole", "OP is still making excuses in the comments. That almost absolves Marissa in my eyes.", "Not call off but just request off in advance. I told my boss for a few months I wouldn\u2019t be able to work that day.", "I\u2019m not arguing? Because you said it wasn\u2019t her ticket to give away. So why was she the one in possession of it rather than the owner of it.", "Yeah I responded to OP to dig deeper. Something doesn\u2019t feel right. \n\nThe swifties have amassed into a swarm though. This is kind of amazing. Like a video of a bee hive melting a hornet that broke in.", "It wasnt hers to give away because Marissa paid her for it\u2026 but have you ever bought concert tickets? If you want seats together one person would buy them and the tickets will be on their account. \n\nYou can transfer the tickets to someone if they have a Ticketmaster account", "She was supposed to be done around 12. There were 2 hours where she just didn\u2019t respond and we had absolutely no clue what was going on with her. We all were calling and texting", "Im a recent convert and I have to say, I\u2019m here for this post.", "So\u2026 once Marissa knew she didn\u2019t have the day off she could have considered the necessity of a back up plan and had OP transfer the ticket to her in case she needed to meet them there. That way, OP is no longer in possession of it. Which would mean she could never have made a back up plan with her sister, her sister would have to make that deal with Marissa if it came to that. She was able to transfer her money easily enough. That doesn\u2019t mean Marissa is to blame but it does raise the importance within this friend group of being responsible for your own ticket, etc rather than entrusting it to someone else.", "Gotcha. So I\u2019ll be honest you all suck here. Marissa for her terrible time management and committing to 12 but then not notifying anyone in the 2 hours. A lot of people are hung up on \u201cwell what if she couldn\u2019t use her phone\u201d but to me there would have been a point before noon where she realized she wasn\u2019t going to make it that she could have alerted everyone. \n\nHowever, it really seems like you just wanted to give your sister the ticket. Even if that\u2019s not true, you gotta understand the optics look bad.", "My post or OP?"]}
