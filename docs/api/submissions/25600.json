I could almost repair the glass with what's in the trunk of my car.

Hell, if you're careful about it, you could use your hand. So I guess she's out there.- The most evil thing you can put shards of glass in is food. (Shoes are a close 2nd.) She'll throw it away, for sure. But think of all the possibilities of living things that might have access to and the hunger for any kind of food they can find. Dogs, cats, rats, mice, birds, fish, even the homeless guy you see every day at the corner. Trash doesn't evaporate when the trash men pick it up. There are still a good number of rungs below us in the food chain. She just fed them shards of glass. It's bad enough it's all out there to begin with.

In case roomie had a slice while hungry, OP would have been the AH to berate her, yeah.\n\nBut. Roomie decided -- not to eat some, not to cut up a slice and use it for her deranged and insane solution (a stray dog/rodent/bird could eventually eat that, ingest the shards and die horribly), but to use the whole cake, then get upset and make a fuss when OP understandably complained.\n\nRoomie is unfortunately both disrespectful and not the brightest shard in the cake.", "So you're okay if I use your food to clean up a mess?", "Copying and pasting my reply to someone else\u2019s comment here because it also fits here. \n\nWet towel/rag, paper towel, potato, lint roller, any kind of tape, I can name a ton of ways to clean glass that doesn\u2019t involve picking up each individual piece of glass by hand or using someone else\u2019s food.

I'm guessing both the packaging style, as well as the label this may appear cheap - not in terms of ingredients but an assumed cost. A cake that can be full wrapped up certainly suggests to me that it's cheaper than a cake with decorations or frosting. I realize this isn't always the case, I know of some fruit cakes that are quite expensive and wrapped in foil, but generally this tends to be true. If the packaging is from a store, quite often a very similar product written in a language other than English is cheaper than one written in English here. It's just the way grocery stores have marketed things, the international aisle tends to be cheaper than equivalent product in other aisles.\n\nIt does sound like she was willing to replace it. You didn't explain to her why it couldn't be replaced.\n\nI think he actions were a bit odd, but with a cake that she didn't realize the significance, that had sat in a communal area for days and that she was going to replace - using it to clean glass seems odd, but not rude.\n\nYou need to communicate with her, both so she understands why this was upsetting (and maybe she can find a way to come up with a reasonable replacement). You 2 also need to communicate plans for what is ok to use, what isn't, etc. When sharing a living space some things will be shared.", "I think what she did is INSANE, but she can't know how much she insulted you if you don't explain why you're so hurt.", "She is not a mind reader.

Give it a try.  Would I be upset if you used something special to me? Sure!  But if I had not told you that it was special, I would not blame you for reaching for that first. - That's just me.  I typically look for other people's perspectives before making judgments or getting upset...or ratherremaining upset. I might initially get upset... but then look as the whole situation and information   If you were my roommate and constantly did mindless and careless things, I'd talk to you first.  If that was just your personality ans how you dealt with stuff then we'd have to figure out if we were suitable roommates or not.   - BTW .. I like your username!", "A house that doesn't have a brush isn't likely to have lint rollers, tape and so on.  I'd never even consider using a towel for that, they are expensive and would nee to be thrown out afterwards to avoid slicing people after showering or getting glass into food.\n\nA potato would work, obviously that is also food and I'm again wagering that a household without a brush isn't likely to be one where people keep a stock of basics like potatoes too.\n\n>It\u2019s stupid to act like ops cake was the only possible option available.\n\nI never said it was the only option, clearly the people in this post aren't too experienced at adult life and given this was **A** VALID OPTION, given this was what was seen online recently it is understandable that this and not a potato was what was used.  For students presumably starting out together it isn't even a given that they'd bother to properly clean up shards of glass.\n\nIts a bloody cake, the damage is already done and OP isn't offering any solution at all to this issue.

But reading OP's post and comments it's simply not the case. Saying that using the \"cheap banana cake\" without any context is devaluation of OP is insane. \n\nNow about touching it at all. I thought about e.s.h based on previous paragraph but 2 weeks without explanation why this cake is worth more than on price tag? Really? Is it mature for you? I would understand if roommate knew about it, if she simply dismissed cake's importance. \n\nBut there's is no any importance of cake. It's not vase or some other family relic. Only value it has is important only for OP and without explanation it will be so. That's why I can't blame Jane for not understanding, there is nothing to understand.

That you?", "No one cares about your opinion - your comment is cheap", "I will say if this cake was so valuable she should prob not put it on living room table and not tell anyone about it. Maybe put it in your room? Or in minifridge with a sticky note?  If it was so important I dont get why you would put it out like\nIts for everybody", "Of course it is an idiotic behavior to waste food to get rid of glass shards when there are so many other options like a rag or toilet paper. I would even say so if it was her own cake. \n\nI voted ESH because of it.\n\nJane for wasting food, but OP for not explaining what was going on and then shutting her off for a whole week, because if it was a cheap cake like it was from Jane's perspective, her \"crime\" so to speak was negligible and really minor. And she also offered to replace the cake at once with a better tasting and more expensive one. It just would not be this big thing. OP never would have reacted like this in a thousand years if it was truly a cheap cake she bought from a shop where she lives currently.", "For being angry that someone used her cake as mop? \n\nBecause she was supposed to tell an adult \"don't use my cake to clean up glass shards because it is special to me?\"\n\nAnd you are supposedly the one reasoning not \"childish?\"", "I mean I do agree.
