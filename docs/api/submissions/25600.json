She'll throw it away, for sure. But think of all the possibilities of living things that might have access to and the hunger for any kind of food they can find. Dogs, cats, rats, mice, birds, fish, even the homeless guy you see every day at the corner. Trash doesn't evaporate when the trash men pick it up. There are still a good number of rungs below us in the food chain. She just fed them shards of glass. It's bad enough it's all out there to begin with.

I was planning to eat it on that day until she used it to clean up the glass shards.", "It was the way she disrespected me and telling me it is just a \"cheap banana cake\" and trying to replace it with another cake doesn't even compensate in sentimental value, and thinking how a cake from the cafe is good enough in compensation (just because of the cost) made me so angry that I don't think living with her is a good idea anymore. \n\nI worry that she will make more demeaning comments on the food from my culture.", "It didn't fuck up my life. I am just very angry with her. I got very offended by her \"cheap banana cake\" comment. So if I got my cake from an expensive bakery/cafe, say it hypothetically cost $200 a slice, does it make her actions anymore egregious?", "I don\u2019t think you know what that word means.", "You've failed to explain the emotional value of the banana cake. She believes its a \"cheap banana cake\" and yet you wonder why she seems unapologetic? Talk. To. Her. Explain why it's made you sad, angry and disappointed.", "Unfortunately people won't understand cultural insensitivity until it's explained to them. It's fine if you don't want to be the one to do so, but she will learn nothing.", "Just change roommates now so you don't continue to have new stories\n\nHopefully you can find out the unique recipe. I love banana cake", "She sounds like an idiot, but unless you actually explain *why* the banana bread meant so much to you, you can't really expect her to understand the severity of the issue.", "If you explained this and she still doesn't get it, then she's ta. If you've just been giving her the silent treatment and tryna figure out how to cut her out of your life rather than trying to communicate with your roommate... That's a different story.", "A thick layer of napkins run through water will also do the trick", "They don't even have a broom, there's no way they have paper towels", "Get a plunger while you're at it.", "Why would it being ordinary cake make it ok? It\u2019s not her food, and the price of college and the cost of living combined make college student food insecurity a very real problem for more students than you\u2019d think.", "Of course she doesn't understand, you haven't explained it. People arent likely to apologise over something so trivial especially if you're yelling at them and they don't understand the context of it.\n\nThe most she had to do in this situation after using the cake would be a \"hey sorry, I used your cake to clean this but I'll replace it later with a better one\"", "Hi OP, it sounds like you took \u201ccheap\u201d to mean \u201clow quality\u201d or \u201clow class\u201d or something like that. Often, it\u2019s used simply to say \u201cinexpensive,\u201d without being a negative judgment on whatever it\u2019s describing. \n\nFor example, I have an amazing pair of shoes that were only $10. When someone compliments them, I might say, \u201cThanks! I can\u2019t believe they were so cheap!\u201d I don\u2019t mean that they\u2019re poorly made or tacky or anything like that \u2014 just that they didn\u2019t cost me much. \n\nMy point is that your roommate likely just meant something like, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so upset. I used an inexpensive item that can be easily replaced.\u201d Not, \u201cThat cake looked gross and poorly made anyway\u201d or something. \n\nOf course, WE know it can\u2019t actually be replaced, but it sounds like your roommate doesn\u2019t. I doubt she was being judgmental about the quality of your cake or whatever. She just didn\u2019t understand why you were SO upset.", "I know this isn't the point, but who the hell eats cake for breakfast?? That's wild", "While there is a *chance* this is her being remarkably offensive about your culture, I suspect it is the simpler possibility. \n\nShe didn't see your cake as \"this is something important to OP due to her culture\", she saw the cake as \"some random cake that OP picked up that has no particular importance or significance\". \n\nTalk to your roommate, ***calmly***, and explain that the cake is something from your home, ***why*** it is important to you, and how it helped you deal with home sickness. If she is still disrespectful, *then* go talk to someone about switching if you still want to do so.", "Well then tell her that instead of random people on the internet.", "Alright I'll try talking to her tonight", "This. For all she knows you picked up a 1$ banana cake from a nearby store. If she doesn\u2019t know, at least let her know. Then decide based on her reaction. If I had done that I\u2019d been so sorry.", "I don't know what country OP is staying in, but I don't know of one where it's okay to go through your new roommate's stuff, steal their food, fill their bread with glass, and then not apologize.\n\nAnd to think that she can replace OP's food from their home country with $$ is a very American mindset. (I say as an American.)\n\nOP, switch roommates if you can. This is entitled, uncurious behavior that you shouldn't need to put up with.", "They gotta have toilet paper.", "It would not have made wasting food okay, but she offered to replace the cake with a better, more expensive one. So there would have been no money loss or increased food insecurity for OP. Also OP specifically wrote this:\n\n>It's not about the cake's monetary value\n\nIf it were an ordinary cake, this AITA post would not exist for sure. OP might have been a bit angry and think her roommate is an idiot for not using a rag or toilet paper instead and might have also asked her to never take her food again in the future, but in the end she would have agreed to the better replacement cake and would have moved on and everything would have been fine.", "My vote is ESH. You placed banana bread in a shared living space and didn't tell anyone it was important. I definitely think it's stupid to use a whole loaf (if that's how much she used, we don't know if it was just a slice or not) to clean up glass but I think getting that angry, not talking for a week and consider changing roommates is an overreaction. You just met and it was a misunderstanding.", "Ngl though there are so many red flags for the roomate that I would be wanting to move out too. \n\nFirst, using the food in the first place- no way in hell am I stealing a roomate's food when I've known them a mere three days. Only someone shitty to live with finds stealing strangers food acceptable. \n\nSecond, the only acceptable reaction if your roommate is upset about you taking their irreplaceable banana bread is mortification. If she's doubling down by calling it 'cheap' there's literally no reasoning with her. She is and will continue to be a bad roomate.", "I feel like I would be pretty mad even if it was cheap cake because of the principle. If my roommate feels comfortable taking my food and has the audacity to call it cheap, when I've known them for three days, I'm just going to assume that they'll be happy to steal my stuff going forward, and will be a selfish roomate. First impressions matter. \n\nIf this had happened six months in in the context of otherwise peaceful co existence, I'd feel differently, but it's a major red flag that roomate is happy to act this way a mere three days in", "I mean, I agree that OP should have explained rather than just not speaking to the room mate. \n\nBut I feel like if you've just moved in and someone is already taking and destroying your food, even if it wasn't something sentimental, it would be reasonable to be annoyed and expect an apology. I don't think it's negligible or really minor to take something belonging to your brand new room mate you barely know and waste it. Especially with students who generally don't have a lot of money to buy treats like cakes, even cheaper ones.", "I think it\u2019s more about boundaries and the fact she uses OP\u2019s stuff. It wasn\u2019t her\u2019s, no matter the value she is the AH for touching other people\u2019s stuff. OP has every reason to be mad even without the sentimental part so idk why him suddenly saying it meant a lot to him would make it better? clearly she already lacked the basic decency to ask before using other people\u2019s stuff, and he shouldn\u2019t need to spell stuff like this out, this should be. a common thing for roommates.", "no she still would have been an AH for using her roommate\u2019s stuff, especially food. It shouldn\u2019t matter if she offered to replace it she should have asked and OP has zero obligation to tell her it\u2019s special, what for? she doesn\u2019t care and probably wouldn\u2019t if it was from his dead grandma or smth", "And seeing a doctor?", "Presumably the \"shared living space\" is the kitchen...aka a perfectly reasonable place to store food with the expectation that no one would take it? Anyone saying that OP should have specified that her roommate wasn't to touch it is unhinged, you shouldn't have to tell people you've been living with only three days that they can't touch your food. Plus calling a stranger's food 'cheap' is a huge insult and assuming that you have free reign to use your roomate's food just because you'll buy them a more expensive 'better version' smacks of entitlement. Roomate will 100% be shit to live with.", "Do you honestly believe telling her not to touch it would have a different result? It's not roommate's cake to touch in the first place. The fact she didn't buy it should be enough to realize you shouldn't touch it", "The rising price of college combined with the rising cost of living makes the use of someone else\u2019s food for any reason asshole behavior.", "Who on earth is assuming that their roommate's food is 'unimportant' in the first place? I'm assuming their living space is the kitchen, so a perfectly reasonable place for OP to store food with the expectation that her roommate doesn't touch it. \n\nIn all the time that I've been living with housemates, including strangers, never once has anyone had to be told not to steal each others food.", "Okay, whatever you do or decide: First rule in roommate situation: Never ever leave something important to you that is edible on the kitchen table. Expecially not for days and without comment!\n\nNAH.", "fr. they\u2019ve been living together for a short time, it\u2019s all downhill from here. she\u2019ll get more comfortable shitting on op\u2019s boundaries as time goes by. if op can switch roommates, they should. nta.", "And a wet paper towel wouldn't work?\nTo me it just feels wrong to use bread for that if other things work just as well", "Bread works better than wet paper towels in my experience"]}
