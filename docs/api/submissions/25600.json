Ok, momentarily putting aside that the absolute BEST idea this chick came up with to pick up shards of glass, in an entire 2 people living there apartment was an article she read that she thinks said to use bread.- Really, I've got 5 better options in my small purse. I could almost repair the glass with what's in the trunk of my car. Off the top of my head: 2 pieces of any size paper, mismatched socks, cardboard moving box, packing tape, duct tape, bubble gum if it was a shot glass. Hell, if you're careful about it, you could use your hand. So I guess she's out there.- The most evil thing you can put shards of glass in is food. (Shoes are a close 2nd.) She'll throw it away, for sure. But think of all the possibilities of living things that might have access to and the hunger for any kind of food they can find. Dogs, cats, rats, mice, birds, fish, even the homeless guy you see every day at the corner. Trash doesn't evaporate when the trash men pick it up. There are still a good number of rungs below us in the food chain. She just fed them shards of glass. It's bad enough it's all out there to begin with. Let's not start infusing the somewhat beneficial parts with glass shards. But, really, if possible, OP, you really need to rethink this living situation. Or she must have some huge positive aspects. This one incident leads me to believe she's careless, selfish, willing to take what's yours without asking for literally the dumbest reason I ever heard, cruel & clueless. If it's already a done deal, only agree to the shortest possible lease. Good luck. Keep your things locked up and switch to unbreakable cups.", "NTA - I'd change roommates. You don't use other people's food to clean up glass. And the fact that she doesn't understand this tells me you're going to be dealing with a bunch of other nonsense with her.
