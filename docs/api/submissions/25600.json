I could almost repair the glass with what's in the trunk of my car.

Hell, if you're careful about it, you could use your hand. So I guess she's out there.- The most evil thing you can put shards of glass in is food. (Shoes are a close 2nd.) She'll throw it away, for sure. But think of all the possibilities of living things that might have access to and the hunger for any kind of food they can find. Dogs, cats, rats, mice, birds, fish, even the homeless guy you see every day at the corner. Trash doesn't evaporate when the trash men pick it up. There are still a good number of rungs below us in the food chain. She just fed them shards of glass. It's bad enough it's all out there to begin with.

Phones exist ...", "You\u2019re gonna compare her food to paper towels? Please. Do you make it a habit of taking other peoples food and thinking it\u2019s not a big deal?", "Panic? It's a broken glass, not a fire.", "I just assumed I was talking to a child since you continuously use the wrong your and you use flawed logic. My apologies, that one is on me.", "I'm wondering why it was necessary to use the WHOLE LOAF of bread instead of say just cut off a slice so the whole thing isn't ruined. That is assuming there truly was NOTHING else to safely clean it up with and she couldn't just pop over to the store to get any number of things without fear of harming someone.", "So roommate isn't the brightest bulb. She looked up the best way to clean glass and blindly followed some internet \"hack.\" She used something of OP's that - from the roommate's perspective - is easily replaceable.\n\nMeanwhile, OP is as upset as if roommate had killed her dog. The cake may not be *easily* replaceable, but it is in fact replaceable. It's not like the cake was the last one made by grandma, who just died, and no one has the recipe.", "That's absurd. Roommate had every intention of replacing it.", "It's not like roommate was like, \"I used your stuff, get over it.\" Roommate intended to replace it with something of equal or greater value. It's a cake, not a handmade sweater.\n\nIt isn't as easy to replace as roommate assumed it would be, but it is replaceable.", "They don't have a broom or vacuum, yet. OP stated that in the post. I'm saying ESH. Roommate should have thought of something else, like asking a neighbor to borrow a broom. But OP is blowing this way out of proportion. The cake might not be EASY to replace and I understand sentimentality, but being THIS mad that she's wanting to move out is quite dramatic. These are both young women learning to adult for the first time. Roommate clearing didn't thinknstraight in the moment, but that doesn't make her a completely horrible, irredeemable person.", "Clean up a dangerous mess on their shared floor.", "Yes and offering to replace it is helpful, but it doesn't change the fact that using someone else's food, regardless of what it is, to CLEAN THE FLOOR, is gross and disrespectful. Taking someone's food without asking is a red flag, and wasting food by using it in such a stupid way is another red flag. \n\nThe \"specialness\"/price of this cake isn't really the point, only adds to it. If it was any old bit of other food, the roommate is still showing a bunch of entitled, rude behaviour and they only just met. \n\nAlso it's clear in the post that it's not possible to get the specific cake in the country they now live in, so replacing it with like-for-like isn't an option. Have you never lived in another country and appreciated little treats from home that aren't available in the new country? It might sound silly but it can be a real comfort and treat, even if it's something inexpensive.", "No offense bro but ur crazy. No way in hell is OP an AH at all when their new roommate steals their stuff to clean up a mess they made instead of going to the store and getting what they need to clean it up properly", "School has just started. I maybe wouldn't have developed close contacts with my collega dorm mates within a week.", "Sometimes you gotta use what is at hand. People can and do use any of my stuff, as needed.\n\nBut if something was special to me I'd use my big words and say \"oh shit, I'm sad that's gone. It was from my home town and I was looking forward to it\". And she'd say \"oh no, I'm so sorry, maybe I can get you a new cake you will like from here to make up for it\".", "depending on how you grew up, a broken glass can definitely be a panic", "yes I missed you're while typing on my phone,  one look at your profile tells me *you're* lonely and nobody really likes you and you use your sexuality to try to be unique, *you're* not, *you're* nothing, just like the rest of us.", "Believe it or not, the bread trick works amazingly.  Generally it has to be the cheap white sandwich bread or similar texture, but if you break glass in the house and like to go barefoot or have pets or small kids crawling around, it's worth wasting one slice of (your own) bread.\n\nUsing your roommate's bread would be poor judgement.", "Couldn't agree more. Using someone else's cake to clean up broken glass is a bit of a stupid choice, as is OP's refusal to communicate about it afterwards, but both relatively minor in the big picture. Specifics aside, I'd bet that many of us here (that are a little older) have been on one side or both of this situation at some point. Learning how to communicate with people and resolve conflicts is one of the best skills you can have in life, as is learning how to react in the moment and \"clean up your mess\" (literally and figuratively). Nothing here is unforgivable - TALK about it, learn from it, and move on.", "Or, you know, have basic respect for your room mates and don't touch stuff that isn't yours without asking.", "AH comment.  First rule of being a roommate is to respect the other roommate and their things, which the AH in the post did not do.", "Having roommates and helping yourself to their food without asking is an asshole move.", "And people who ask forgiveness later instead of permission in the moment suck.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like that particular cake is easily replaceable. A cake flavor with special significance can\u2019t just be replaced by some other cake that tastes completely different.", "That's still not good justification for taking someone's item, even if you think you can just go buy one it's still AH behavior. You're telling me you wouldn't be annoyed if you came home wanting some cereal after work and your roommate said oh yeah I used your milk to drown a spider sorry ill replace it?", "It\u2019s literally not replaceable until OP goes home again, like did you even read the post? And even if it was replaceable, so what? Don\u2019t touch food that isn\u2019t yours, period. And on top of that OP is clearly incredibly upset so roommate should read the room and realize \u201coh wow I fucked up, maybe I should apologize and try to find out why my roommate is so upset over a cake.\u201d", "With the worst possible thing she could find. Why didn\u2019t she ask to borrow a broom form someone else instead?", "And if you are so far from close contacts that you don\u2019t have their phone number, don\u2019t use their food to clean up glass. Leave a note that says \u201ccareful - broken glass!  Running to the store for <a broom, paper towels, rags, etc>\u201d and then do that.  Might even be cleaned before OP returns because college dorms tend to have plenty of essentials. She could even buy a loaf of cheap bread and use a slice of that if she really wants to try out the tok tok trend or whatever", "Still don\u2019t agree. She could have used something other than her food.", "This is likely their first time being a roommate, and they\u2019re only a few weeks into it.", "No, but she doesn\u2019t know that", "New dorm room, it sounds like. Not sure who is there or home or who has a broom. \n\nWe absolutely did not have a broom. I don't think our floor was swept or vacuumed for 5 months", "I've been in a dorm where the only stuff you have at hand is see through toilet paper and a bar fridge with a bad light. I", "Wet paper Towels don't get those tiny shards of glass at all. Bread picks it all all up. I rather use bread to pick up Gass then run the risk of my kids or pets getting hurt", "I think that's sort of a \"blame the victim\" mentality. You're right that people should make an effort to protect the stuff that's valuable to them, but the person who destroys someone else's possessions is still ultimately in the wrong. In the case of a blender, if you had an agreement that you all shared appliances then that's one thing, but if it was exclusively your blender then that's a different thing.", "Everyone saying \u201cJust talk to your roommate about why you\u2019re mad!\u201d  Clearly have no idea about how clueless & rude people can be.  In our city right now the University is asking people to let out a spare room for a student, when I think about roommate proofing my house\u2026I like my blender, let\u2019s put it that way.", "I would ask my neighbors, at least in my experience a lot of people I know brought those little hand vacuumed and brooms, dust brushes. It could be because we were told to bring those things.\nbut even so I would use the shirt off my back before I tried to sweep with cake."]}
