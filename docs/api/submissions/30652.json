Growing up in south Florida, she didn't have much opportunity to travel, so she's very excited to see Paris for the 1st time, mountains with snow (Alps), etc.\n\nI am a very experienced traveler and for multiple practical reasons I ALWAYS travel with a carry-on, whether for 1, 2 or 3 weeks. If I need to wash clothes along the way, fine. I told my niece that this was my **only** condition for us to travel together.\n\nI don't like the extra hassle of having to check luggage, then wait for it at the other end, while hoping the airline didn't lose it. Also, I know who will end up carrying that huge suitcase around cities, and up/down subway stairs -- ME! :)\n\nI understand she doesn't have experience packing, so I went over what we'll need. I even packed my carry-on in front of her, so she could see what I was taking. I explained to her several times why it's more practical to travel light, with carry-ons only. But she's still whining that she wants a large suitcase. IDK, maybe she needs a lot of clothes because she's planning a fashion show for her followers on Instagram/ TikTok, LOL.

Am I being an unreasonable AH to expect that a young lady can survive for 2 weeks with a carry-on only (even though one of our Airbnbs has washer/dryer)? Or am I right to draw that line in the sand, since I understand better the issues that come with not traveling light?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT #1: Thanks for all the replies! This keeps coming up in the comments, so maybe I should add it here. The problem with a large suitcase is not just the extra time to check it before the flight and wait for it at the other end. There's always the small risk that it won't arrive with you. \n\nMost importantly though are the practical and security issues. Some of you appear to not be familiar with travel in Europe and may not understand what this involves, including the security risks. We'll have 4 days on the move, having to carry all our bags along busy streets, train/subway stations, up/down stairs, etc. \n\nTrain stations in Paris and other large cities area often a little dangerous, popular among pickpockets. My niece is not familiar with this kind of risk and I will NOT endanger her by letting her lag behind trying to drag a large suitcase, just to \"prove a point\" that she should've packed light. I will end up carrying her large suitcase in such situations, if she takes one.", "created_utc": 1699536973, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17rd2xr/wibtah_if_i_insisted_that_my_niece_travel_for_2/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

On the other hand, I'm a guy who doesn't require much maintenance.\n\nYou're definitely being a curmudgeon, though. You're an adult, you don't have to carry anything for your niece.

I agree with the folks who said to tell her \u201cyou packed it you carry it\u201d. And stick to it no matter how much she whines. \n\n2. A lot depends on how much you\u2019re moving around in Europe. It\u2019s one thing to have heavy bags if you go to a city for five days, another for three, and a third for six. It\u2019s another thing entirely if you\u2019re hopping cities every couple of days. \n\n3. Being from Florida, your niece may be used to driving absolutely everywhere. She may not realize how different it is in Europe. This extends beyond just luggage; if she\u2019s Instagram-crazy she may be intending to wear uncomfortably high-heeled shoes all the time, etc. Not unusual for a twenty-something today but probably could use a dose of reality. \n\n4. Any chance you could take her on a short trip (like long weekend) to someplace like NYC or Boston where people walk everywhere?

Make it clear ahead of time that there will be no big suitcase and no complaining. Those are the grounds for the trip. If she doesn\u2019t agree, traveling alone is better than a whiny overpacked companion.", "My own personal rule after the last 4 years is the same as yours: when traveling internationally, checked bags = lost bags. \n\ntip: get her packing cubes. They're a lifesaver. I did 2 weeks around europe last summer and it was perfect. NTA", "NTA, even flying domestically I try to avoid checking bags whenever possible. I recently took my younger sister to a destination that she has always wanted to go. I was told I'm being too harsh by making sure she only had a small carry-on suitcase. I even helped her pack for the trip and made sure she had room to bring back a lot of souvenirs. She did by a lot of stuff there and ended up also stashing some in my suitcase on the way home. There is nothing wrong with packing smart and exact with 1 spare outfit just in case.", "NTA and no, you should not \"just suck it up\". Yours is a reasonable condition that any normal adult should be perfectly happy with, especially considering that the whole thing is a free trip. And you are right, the hours wasted in airports, waiting for your luggage to come, could be spent so much better. Strangely enough, the washing mashine and laundry detergents have found their way even to the darkest corners of Europe! LOL.", "NTA I traveled to Paris and the US last summer for 7 weeks and only used a carry on. In Paris, there was a laundromat down the street, next to a caf\u00e9 where I could enjoy my coffee and croissant while the laundry spun and in the US I had a washer/dryer. It was more than fine. Do **not** let her pack a big suitcase unless you are prepared to make her deal with it. She will be miserable. In Europe, train and subway travel means schlepping suitcases up and down a lot of staircases. You do not want to take on that burden. And it's so nice to breeze through airports without waiting for luggage.   \nHere's what I took, heavily edited and curated to make sure I always looked nice and had appropriate things to wear for all kinds of activities and unexpected invitations: 2 skirts, 2 pairs of pants, six tops ranging from casual to dressy, two dresses with everything in the same color family so you can mix and match (I always decide beforehand if my base is black, navy, or camel/cream and build the travel wardrobe from there); 5 pairs of underwear and socks, 1 sleep shirt, 1 pair of sneakers, 1 pair of comfortable but attractive walking shoes, 1 pair of light strappy heels; some nice accessories that don't take up a ton of room, a small toiletries bag and one 10 shade eyeshadow palette. Lightweight, washable silk is a dream; it takes up practically no space and is elegant. I was able to do light hiking to fancy dinner parties with this mix, had no trouble carrying it or putting it in the overhead bin, and had room to buy gifts.", "YTA Your expectations are unreasonable for a 20 year old woman. There are many options for luggage sizes. You could ensure that she uses a smaller piece of luggage in addition to her carry on. This way she\u2019s not over packing and it\u2019s easier for her to handle on her own.", "YWBTA\nIt\u2019s not only about clothing but cosmetic products, hair drier/similar. I\u2019ve travelled a lot and, if it\u2019s a matter of choice, I would get a checked in luggage for a 2 week trip too. I\u2019d rather be relaxed & enjoy the sights than think that I have to repackage my cosmetic products into smaller bottles and waste time on finding a laundry, washing, drying etc. \nYou could reiterate that you are not going to carry her luggage and, if the plane tickets were bought with carry on only, that she is responsible to pay any luggage fees along the way (including storage in cities)", "NAH. Shoot, I take a large suitcase for one week.\nShe probably has no idea what she\u2019ll want to wear, and if she\u2019s anything like my 20s daughter, she\u2019ll wear multiple outfits each day.\nHave fun!", "NAH   I would just point out that not checking your luggage is your personal preference.

Get her the largest one allowed on the carrier.", "I cruise. I bring one suitcase (yes it is the big one).

And if you do she\u2019ll probably be miserable and blame you. \n\nI think you\u2019ll just have to accept it, but don\u2019t carry her stuff for her (though you can offer to help on some of the bigger staircases)\n\nCan you find any articles about London or Paris stations and the age of them and how they all have stairs? I remember hauling my suitcase around london, exhausted and miserable. And now I use a back pack!", "NTA. She doesn't have to come.\n\nThat said is there a compromise possible here? I do have some sympathy. Hand luggage doesn't offer a lot when you want something stylish for going out in cities, don't want to wear the same clothes every day, and also want something warm for mountains. \n\nA backpack is a lot more convenient and it feels a lot more reasonable to expect her to lug it around. Sure, you'll have to wait at the airport for bag check/reclaim, but that's not going to add a lot of time.", "YTA. You know how to pack lightly because you're a seasoned traveller. You know what's essential *to you*. She needs to learn this stuff herself. The things you mention sure are a bit of a faff, but you would be better equipped to deal with that than vice versa. Totally fair to say she has to carry it herself though.", "YWNBTA - if you tell her right now what to expect from you. \u201cIf you show up with large luggage you will be repacking it in a carry on\u201d. \n\nIf she truly needs to check a bag then she is 20\u2026 she can figure it out & carry it without your help.\n\n(My husband has the same rule for our family. He travels often. Our kids (26,26,28,30) have learned to never carry big luggage\u2026 we go by the rule if you forget it or need it then you go buy it. Not the end of the world)", "If she shows up with her big suitcase tell her that she will solely be responsible for moving it- stairs, subways etc. And stick to your word- if she needs all that extra stuff she needs to be ready to carry it. \n\nPersonally I could not travel for 2 -3 weeks with just a carry on and I wouldn\u2019t even want to try. But I pack a bag I can deal with by myself without inconveniencing anyone else. \n\nNTA", "NTA but let her make her own mistakes. Be very clear though, up front, you will never haul, carry or lift her large suitcase. If she wants to bring it\u2026she must haul it herself.", "INFO: Are you male?\n\nYTA - I ask the question because IDK how any female travels for 2 weeks with just a carry on. I mean you can't even fit enough liquids (shampoo, conditioner, etc with the 3 oz restrictions) in a carry on for travel for 2 weeks, let alone enough clothes and accessories. I get that you don't want to carry her shit around but I don't get why you would have to. You let her know now before the trip that if she brings a large suitcase that she and she alone will be responsible for   carrying it around.

You admit she hasn't traveled much. You decided to make this a gift. Most people going on a 2 week international trip would check a bag. It's great that you don't need to!

But everyone saying she's a big girl and can handle a check back, so is she big enough to get to the hotel/airbnb on their own? Or can OP just head off as they planned w. Their carry on.

She'll manage the suitcase.", "YTA. This is a silly hill to die on. If you want, encourage her to get a backpack rather than a suitcase and make sure she knows she'll have to carry it.", "YTA- not everyone is comfortable traveling light and either it\u2019s a gifted trip or not. Too many restrictions and she won\u2019t want to go. A 20 yo girl is going to want to look amazing on her trip - I\u2019m not 20 and I would NOT travel overseas with just a carryon. But yes she is responsible for all her bags.", "YTA. Let her pack how she wants, and deal with the consequences. If you don't want to carry her bag, don't. Also, you don't have to wait that long to get a checked bag at the airport. It'll delay you less than 30mins probably.", "YTA\n\nI've traveled a lot my whole life and I have only once had a mishap with my luggage. Actually twice - and that was bc my carry-on was forced to be checked at the gate (crowding) and went on to another city without me, leaving me trapped in NYC in winter with no warm wear (as it was in my carry on and I was coming from warmth.) \n\nCarry-on is fine for men. It's fine for women IF you are doing a singular activity, like hiking, or going to a beach. If you are traveling in mild weather. And if you are a simple/ low maintenance person and esp if you are white with straight hair. \n\nIf you have any texture to your hair, you need products. If you have more melanin, you probably need body moisturizer. You may need a (decent) hair dryer. (Airbnbs and hotels often have awful ones.) You probably want a minimum of two shoes (walking, evening) and that is harder if it's cooler (boots). IF she wears makeup, it's costly to get small sizes of everything just to fit in carry on - esp the liquids etc. Ridiculously expensive in fact.\n\nThe compression cubes can help, as can the very fancy small suitcases but it really just depends on the person. \n\nSo yeah. It's a rude imposition to save a COUPLE of minutes on the other side. I've never waited more than 5-10 minutes in pretty much every continent other than Africa and Australia. Bc you have to debark, get to customs, clear customs, etc. Within Europe - you have less of this, but you're either in a major airport where they are fast bc they are busy, or you are in a secondary airport where they are fast bc they are small.", "[deleted]", "YTA.

But we'll have 4 days on the move, navigating train stations and city streets with our bags. Some of these train stations have lots of pickpockets, so I can't just leave her behind (especially because this kind of big city security risk is not something she's really been exposed to in her life).", "I am considering compromising on letting her take one big suitcase instead of just a carry-on -- but not both, LOL! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry, but that kind of overpacking you describe only works for vacations to resorts or when you have a car taking you from airport to hotel to airport. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have to take trains, walk from A to B, go up and down subway stairs, then that is impossible. Not to mention the safety concerns around many parts of Paris.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, have you never had a luggage lost by an airline? It's awful when it happens at the start of a trip.", "Considering it's winter though, does it matter what you're wearing beneath a heavy jacket or sweater if others can't see it? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe my male perspective is skewed, but I also find it easy to buy things like shampoo along the way, if needed. No need to wait in line. And I'm OK paying it for her, if it helps her travel light.", "If you can travel with only a backpack when you have a toddler in tote, you have my utmost respect. Those little critters need far more supplies than adults do!", "If selfish assholes wouldn't cram full-sized suitcases into the overhead, there would be room for everyone's smaller carry-on.", "Instead of pj's I wear a sort of sack dress to bed that I can also use as a dress or a swimsuit cover-up. No jeans. A plain pair of slacks that I can dress up or down.\n\nAs someone else said, experience tells you how you can \"cheat\" and still look good - and smell good. :)  I do a lot of sink laundry so only fast drying clothes get packed.\n\nThe only thing I miss when I travel is my wardrobe. Shoes are my packing downfall. My largest suitcase is usually full of them.", "Sometimes the bins are full and they force you to gate check it.", "airlines love to charge to check bags, so everyone tries to get away with a carry on. if you\u2019re at the end of the queue, the overhead bins may be full up before you board and they then force you to check your bag at the gate.", "Or you drop by the nearest GLS spot and mail it home if it is important enough.\n\nAnd it has the positive side effect you begin to think about if you _really_ need this dustcollecter or not?", "I was thinking the same thing: a need for suitcase space for purchases made on the trip.", "Men, as a general rule, don't use as many skin care and makeup. Men. in general, will use anything to wash their hair, including only soap.", "You are being wilfully obtuse here and it's plain for everyone to see.", "I\u2019ve traveled 2 weeks in Europe with a carry on. It isn\u2019t as hard as you might think, it just takes planning. Coats and boots are worn on the plane. 3 pairs of shoes is unnecessary - you carefully plan a capsule wardrobe such that everything goes with everything, so you don\u2019t take the outfit that needs special shoes. (Skip the heels, they\u2019ll probably be walking a lot in cobblestones and European women don\u2019t wear them as much.) Internal menstrual products don\u2019t take up much space, while bulky products can probably be bought in country since they tend to be less finicky. I pack 2 sweaters, but not bulky ones. You do need to choose items that pack well.", "She could have bought one for the trip. They\u2019re available on Amazon.", "Not trying to be argumentative, but your plan for getting to your Airbnb sounds overly complicated and possibly dangerous. If it were me, I'd use something like LeCab or Uber in Paris when leaving the airport.", "Why can't you Uber from airports/train stations to the hotels?", "lol It was a hassle to use the train while traveling. The first 2 places I went on the trip we took the train and walked and honestly it was difficult. Thankfully I didn't have any problems and kept a very watchful eye on everything. But by the 3rd city we did just say F\\* the train and took a taxi.\n\n>Also, have you never had a luggage lost by an airline?\n\nNo but this is exactly why I take a carry on along with luggage. I have some clothes and all valuables in the carry-on. That way if the luggage does get lost I still have the (what I consider to be) minimal amount of clothes to get by with and don't have to buy anymore. I had a coworker in mid 2000s to lose luggage on a trip and had to buy everything over. I learned that day pack enough in a carry on to not to have to buy clothes. But I could never do just the carry-on alone.\n\nETA - That she can buy a strap like this one so that she can attach her carryon to her large luggage so it's easier to transport all together.

I once had a true AH on a flight arguing for 40min with the flight attendants against putting his suitcase that was way too big for the head bin as a checked luggage. Such a waste of everyone\u2019s time! Just let folks check luggages for \u201cfree\u201d! Esp on trans-ocean flights", "Menstrual products are inherently personal. There are many women who can't wear just whatever. I can't. As for how many pairs of shoes or sweaters or anything else really are necessary - that's not your call to make. That's also up to each woman to decide. I've regularly walked on cobblestones in heels and it isn't that hard. As for what European women do, that's on them. She isn't a European woman."]}
