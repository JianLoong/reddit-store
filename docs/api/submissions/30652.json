Growing up in south Florida, she didn't have much opportunity to travel, so she's very excited to see Paris for the 1st time, mountains with snow (Alps), etc.\n\nI am a very experienced traveler and for multiple practical reasons I ALWAYS travel with a carry-on, whether for 1, 2 or 3 weeks. If I need to wash clothes along the way, fine. I told my niece that this was my **only** condition for us to travel together.\n\nI don't like the extra hassle of having to check luggage, then wait for it at the other end, while hoping the airline didn't lose it. Also, I know who will end up carrying that huge suitcase around cities, and up/down subway stairs -- ME! :)\n\nI understand she doesn't have experience packing, so I went over what we'll need. I even packed my carry-on in front of her, so she could see what I was taking. I explained to her several times why it's more practical to travel light, with carry-ons only. But she's still whining that she wants a large suitcase. IDK, maybe she needs a lot of clothes because she's planning a fashion show for her followers on Instagram/ TikTok, LOL. Or maybe I'm being an old curmudgeon?\n\nAnyway, before our flight on Saturday I fear she will show up at my door with her large suitcase. If she does... should I just suck it up and mentally prepare myself to carry her suitcase across Europe, to avoid the drama? Or, WIBTAH if I made her pick & choose, repacking a subset of her things into one of my extra carry-ons before our flight (knowing she'll probably complain the whole trip that she doesn't have enough clothes)? Am I being an unreasonable AH to expect that a young lady can survive for 2 weeks with a carry-on only (even though one of our Airbnbs has washer/dryer)? Or am I right to draw that line in the sand, since I understand better the issues that come with not traveling light?\n\nEDIT #1: Thanks for all the replies! This keeps coming up in the comments, so maybe I should add it here. The problem with a large suitcase is not just the extra time to check it before the flight and wait for it at the other end. There's always the small risk that it won't arrive with you.\n\nMost importantly though are the practical and security issues. Some of you appear to not be familiar with travel in Europe and may not understand what this involves, including the security risks. We'll have 4 days on the move, having to carry all our bags along busy streets, train/subway stations, up/down stairs, etc.\n\nTrain stations in Paris and other large cities area often a little dangerous, popular among pickpockets. My niece is not familiar with this kind of risk and I will NOT endanger her by letting her lag behind trying to drag a large suitcase, just to \"prove a point\" that she should've packed light. I will end up carrying her large suitcase in such situations, if she takes one.\n\nEDIT #2:  I'm male.

On the other hand, I'm a guy who doesn't require much maintenance.\n\nYou're definitely being a curmudgeon, though. You're an adult, you don't have to carry anything for your niece.

I agree with the folks who said to tell her \u201cyou packed it you carry it\u201d. And stick to it no matter how much she whines. \n\n2. A lot depends on how much you\u2019re moving around in Europe. It\u2019s one thing to have heavy bags if you go to a city for five days, another for three, and a third for six. It\u2019s another thing entirely if you\u2019re hopping cities every couple of days. \n\n3. Being from Florida, your niece may be used to driving absolutely everywhere. She may not realize how different it is in Europe. This extends beyond just luggage; if she\u2019s Instagram-crazy she may be intending to wear uncomfortably high-heeled shoes all the time, etc. Not unusual for a twenty-something today but probably could use a dose of reality. \n\n4. Any chance you could take her on a short trip (like long weekend) to someplace like NYC or Boston where people walk everywhere? It\u2019s not quite European levels of walking but it might give her a taste of what it really means.", "NTA\u2026..my ex & i once traveled from cali to new jersey\u2026then we got hit by a big storm, it pushed our fight out, then cancelled it, then rerouted to philadelphia \u2026.i learned in philly the value in packing lighter as i hauled my big ass suitcase around town\u2026. some things must be learned by doing\u2026.", "She can take whatever suitcase but tell her ahead of time she\u2019s the one that will be carrying her suitcase around bc you warned her", "NTA.  \n\n\nBut since you're footing the bill, explain to her that she will have to pay for the checked luggage as well as dealing with that luggage on her ow,  \n\n\nI'm guessing once she sees how much airlines charge for that suitcase, she'll quickly find a way to pack a little lighter.", "NTA. Make it clear ahead of time that there will be no big suitcase and no complaining. Those are the grounds for the trip. If she doesn\u2019t agree, traveling alone is better than a whiny overpacked companion.", "My own personal rule after the last 4 years is the same as yours: when traveling internationally, checked bags = lost bags. \n\ntip: get her packing cubes. They're a lifesaver. I did 2 weeks around europe last summer and it was perfect. NTA", "NTA, even flying domestically I try to avoid checking bags whenever possible. I recently took my younger sister to a destination that she has always wanted to go. I was told I'm being too harsh by making sure she only had a small carry-on suitcase. I even helped her pack for the trip and made sure she had room to bring back a lot of souvenirs. She did by a lot of stuff there and ended up also stashing some in my suitcase on the way home. There is nothing wrong with packing smart and exact with 1 spare outfit just in case.", "NTA and no, you should not \"just suck it up\". Yours is a reasonable condition that any normal adult should be perfectly happy with, especially considering that the whole thing is a free trip. And you are right, the hours wasted in airports, waiting for your luggage to come, could be spent so much better. Strangely enough, the washing mashine and laundry detergents have found their way even to the darkest corners of Europe! LOL.", "NTA I traveled to Paris and the US last summer for 7 weeks and only used a carry on. In Paris, there was a laundromat down the street, next to a caf\u00e9 where I could enjoy my coffee and croissant while the laundry spun and in the US I had a washer/dryer. It was more than fine. Do **not** let her pack a big suitcase unless you are prepared to make her deal with it. She will be miserable. In Europe, train and subway travel means schlepping suitcases up and down a lot of staircases. You do not want to take on that burden. And it's so nice to breeze through airports without waiting for luggage.   \nHere's what I took, heavily edited and curated to make sure I always looked nice and had appropriate things to wear for all kinds of activities and unexpected invitations: 2 skirts, 2 pairs of pants, six tops ranging from casual to dressy, two dresses with everything in the same color family so you can mix and match (I always decide beforehand if my base is black, navy, or camel/cream and build the travel wardrobe from there); 5 pairs of underwear and socks, 1 sleep shirt, 1 pair of sneakers, 1 pair of comfortable but attractive walking shoes, 1 pair of light strappy heels; some nice accessories that don't take up a ton of room, a small toiletries bag and one 10 shade eyeshadow palette. Lightweight, washable silk is a dream; it takes up practically no space and is elegant. I was able to do light hiking to fancy dinner parties with this mix, had no trouble carrying it or putting it in the overhead bin, and had room to buy gifts.", "YTA Your expectations are unreasonable for a 20 year old woman. There are many options for luggage sizes. You could ensure that she uses a smaller piece of luggage in addition to her carry on. This way she\u2019s not over packing and it\u2019s easier for her to handle on her own.", "YWBTA\nIt\u2019s not only about clothing but cosmetic products, hair drier/similar. I\u2019ve travelled a lot and, if it\u2019s a matter of choice, I would get a checked in luggage for a 2 week trip too. I\u2019d rather be relaxed & enjoy the sights than think that I have to repackage my cosmetic products into smaller bottles and waste time on finding a laundry, washing, drying etc. \nYou could reiterate that you are not going to carry her luggage and, if the plane tickets were bought with carry on only, that she is responsible to pay any luggage fees along the way (including storage in cities)", "NAH. Shoot, I take a large suitcase for one week.\nShe probably has no idea what she\u2019ll want to wear, and if she\u2019s anything like my 20s daughter, she\u2019ll wear multiple outfits each day.\nHave fun!", "NAH   I would just point out that not checking your luggage is your personal preference. If your niece prefers to travel with checked luggage (so do I) that is just a difference in travel preferences, neither of you is \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong.\u201d\n\nThat said if you\u2019re fully funding this trip she should probably be doing her best to accommodate you.

Get her the largest one allowed on the carrier.", "I cruise. I bring one suitcase (yes it is the big one). Years ago I have said to my cruise companions\u2026what you bring on you must be able to take off yourself. I have been with friends who can\u2019t manage all their bags. I remind them\u2026I have my hands full with my own stuff.

And if you do she\u2019ll probably be miserable and blame you. \n\nI think you\u2019ll just have to accept it, but don\u2019t carry her stuff for her (though you can offer to help on some of the bigger staircases)\n\nCan you find any articles about London or Paris stations and the age of them and how they all have stairs? I remember hauling my suitcase around london, exhausted and miserable. And now I use a back pack!", "NTA. She doesn't have to come.\n\nThat said is there a compromise possible here? I do have some sympathy. Hand luggage doesn't offer a lot when you want something stylish for going out in cities, don't want to wear the same clothes every day, and also want something warm for mountains. \n\nA backpack is a lot more convenient and it feels a lot more reasonable to expect her to lug it around. Sure, you'll have to wait at the airport for bag check/reclaim, but that's not going to add a lot of time.", "YTA. You know how to pack lightly because you're a seasoned traveller. You know what's essential *to you*. She needs to learn this stuff herself. The things you mention sure are a bit of a faff, but you would be better equipped to deal with that than vice versa. Totally fair to say she has to carry it herself though.", "YWNBTA - if you tell her right now what to expect from you. \u201cIf you show up with large luggage you will be repacking it in a carry on\u201d. \n\nIf she truly needs to check a bag then she is 20\u2026 she can figure it out & carry it without your help.\n\n(My husband has the same rule for our family. He travels often. Our kids (26,26,28,30) have learned to never carry big luggage\u2026 we go by the rule if you forget it or need it then you go buy it. Not the end of the world)", "If she shows up with her big suitcase tell her that she will solely be responsible for moving it- stairs, subways etc. And stick to your word- if she needs all that extra stuff she needs to be ready to carry it. \n\nPersonally I could not travel for 2 -3 weeks with just a carry on and I wouldn\u2019t even want to try. But I pack a bag I can deal with by myself without inconveniencing anyone else. \n\nNTA", "NTA but let her make her own mistakes. Be very clear though, up front, you will never haul, carry or lift her large suitcase. If she wants to bring it\u2026she must haul it herself.", "INFO: Are you male?\n\nYTA - I ask the question because IDK how any female travels for 2 weeks with just a carry on. I mean you can't even fit enough liquids (shampoo, conditioner, etc with the 3 oz restrictions) in a carry on for travel for 2 weeks, let alone enough clothes and accessories. I get that you don't want to carry her shit around but I don't get why you would have to. You let her know now before the trip that if she brings a large suitcase that she and she alone will be responsible for   carrying it around. That you will not be carrying it around for her or it will be left wherever she decides she doesn't want to deal with it anymore because you certainly won't be carrying it.", "NTA.", "YWBTA. You admit she hasn't traveled much. You decided to make this a gift. Most people going on a 2 week international trip would check a bag. It's great that you don't need to! But its really not as big a hassle as you're making it out to be.", "Nta, you listed your reason y. But everyone saying she's a big girl and can handle a check back, so is she big enough to get to the hotel/airbnb on their own? Or can OP just head off as they planned w. Their carry on. She is a big girl who could handle their luggage, she's big enough to handle transport too.", "YWBTA. I've done the large suitcase traveling. It's doable. Clothes are important to your niece. She'll manage the suitcase.", "YTA. This is a silly hill to die on. If you want, encourage her to get a backpack rather than a suitcase and make sure she knows she'll have to carry it.", "YTA- not everyone is comfortable traveling light and either it\u2019s a gifted trip or not. Too many restrictions and she won\u2019t want to go. A 20 yo girl is going to want to look amazing on her trip - I\u2019m not 20 and I would NOT travel overseas with just a carryon. But yes she is responsible for all her bags.", "YTA. Let her pack how she wants, and deal with the consequences. If you don't want to carry her bag, don't. Also, you don't have to wait that long to get a checked bag at the airport. It'll delay you less than 30mins probably.", "YTA\n\nI've traveled a lot my whole life and I have only once had a mishap with my luggage. Actually twice - and that was bc my carry-on was forced to be checked at the gate (crowding) and went on to another city without me, leaving me trapped in NYC in winter with no warm wear (as it was in my carry on and I was coming from warmth.) \n\nCarry-on is fine for men. It's fine for women IF you are doing a singular activity, like hiking, or going to a beach. If you are traveling in mild weather. And if you are a simple/ low maintenance person and esp if you are white with straight hair. \n\nIf you have any texture to your hair, you need products. If you have more melanin, you probably need body moisturizer. You may need a (decent) hair dryer. (Airbnbs and hotels often have awful ones.) You probably want a minimum of two shoes (walking, evening) and that is harder if it's cooler (boots). IF she wears makeup, it's costly to get small sizes of everything just to fit in carry on - esp the liquids etc. Ridiculously expensive in fact.\n\nThe compression cubes can help, as can the very fancy small suitcases but it really just depends on the person. \n\nSo yeah. It's a rude imposition to save a COUPLE of minutes on the other side. I've never waited more than 5-10 minutes in pretty much every continent other than Africa and Australia. Bc you have to debark, get to customs, clear customs, etc. Within Europe - you have less of this, but you're either in a major airport where they are fast bc they are busy, or you are in a secondary airport where they are fast bc they are small.", "[deleted]", "YTA.

Did a few Europeans also tease her? Yes. My only point is that if this is your niece\u2019s first time taking a trip like this, wanting (only) one large bag still seems reasonable to me, even if traveling lighter would be less of a hassle.
