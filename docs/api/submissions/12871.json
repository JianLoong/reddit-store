Is that correct? \n\nIssues around payment and cancellation are an important part of analytic therapy, and it\u2019s likely that your psychiatrist has chosen to not be lenient regarding the cancellation fee for a particular reason which is important to your treatment. It sounds like you have turned it into a power struggle, which is important and helpful for treatment, as long as you bring it up with them honestly. \n\nRules are important bc., for example, patients with a paranoid personality type might become very nervous if their therapist does not follow the rules, and it may affect their sense of safety in the treatment (ie. they may start wondering what the therapist is trying to get out of them). A narcissistically inclined or dependent type of patient might see a leniency in the rules are a reflection of them being special or the favourite patient and may stop paying or may start at pushing other boundaries. \n\nIf you are annoyed about being charged, if you feel resentful about how much you have paid, it\u2019s important you bring it up in your next session, as honestly as you can. It\u2019s important for treatment. If you suspect they are not acting in your best interest, also bring it up, their reaction to this will give you a lot of helpful information about whether you wish to continue seeing this person. But you still need to respect your psychiatrists right to not budge on their cancellation policy, and to request that you change a session time or day, so that they can accomodate other patients. \n\nBest of luck in your treatment.\n\nETA: I just saw that she only informed you 20 minutes before your session about double booking you.
