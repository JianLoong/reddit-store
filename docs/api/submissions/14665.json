He would sometimes eat them if we were out at a restaurant and they came as part of his meal. But he never ate them when I cooked for him. Originally I thought that maybe my cooking was the problem so I asked him if he enjoyed my food and he told me he loves my cooking. On nights I didn\u2019t cook for him, he ate exclusively frozen foods and never ate the vegetables in those either. Naturally, he has some health issues. Vitamin deficiencies etc. he had phrased it to me as if he was somehow just genetically unlucky. I believed it for a while bc idk how that stuff works but eventually it became clear to me it\u2019s because he voluntarily eats a vegetable like once a month. \n\n6 months ago I started hiding vegetables in my cooking. If I was making pasta I\u2019d put the vegetables in I\u2019d usually put in for myself, then take half out and blend it so he wouldn\u2019t notice the vegetable chunks and then tell him I\u2019d just scooped the veg out of his portion. This happens more often now we live together because I do all of the cooking. He\u2019s been telling me a lot lately he\u2019s been feeling a lot better the past few months and has even had his doctor reduce the dosage of some of his medications and he hasn\u2019t had to take his multivitamin in weeks. I kept my mouth shut because I\u2019m just glad he\u2019s feeling better and it really does me no harm to hide the veg in his food. \n\nYesterday, I was making one of our regular pasta meals (it\u2019s one that\u2019s very easy to hide at least 4 veggies in) and i was about to blend my boyfriend\u2019s portion when the blender died mid-blend. I had to serve it in all its veg chunk glory.  My boyfriend refused to eat the vegetables but when he tasted the sauce he said it\u2019s weird how it tastes the exact same even though this one has veg in it. So, I confessed. He screamed at me and called me a controlling bitch and said that it\u2019s none of my business if he thinks vegetables don\u2019t do anything. I pointed out he said he felt better. He said his health was none of my business and that I\u2019m a controlling, judgey AH and stormed out of our apartment to stay with his sister. His sister texted me to say he\u2019s fine but she agrees with. him. My friends agree it\u2019s ridiculos that he didn\u2019t eat veg but agree I\u2019m being an AH.

This is a grown man 8 years older than you. If he has a problem with your cooking, let him make his own food. He\u2019s already coddled by his sister and doesn\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t need to be by you.", "This guy is crying about eating vegetable that he didn\u2019t know he was eating and actually liked how it taste. What a donut.", "NTA but you do not need to be with him. He sounds like a child. Move tf on", "NTA. Why are you with a child?", "No. You are NTA in anyway, and I don't care what anyone says. I admittedly was the same way, till my girlfriend kinda got me to start. I've felt much better afterwards and just. Yea. Minus squash. I will straight up fight someone over having to eat that nasty hell food lol\n\nIf he's gonna be a cry baby about it, he can cook his food and you can cook yours. That way he can \"control what he's putting in his body\" as another comment said", "I have to disagree with everyone here, NTA. If you have to sneak in vegetables because he has an abject objection to adhering to his body's requirements to be healthy, then it's because there is something wrong with him and hs needs dragged to a doctor to address his purposeful malnutrition and a therapist to address why he insists on what is basically self-harm out of negligence. \n\nYour feeding him food that he requires to be healthy literally improved his wellbeing. So clearly he's fine with vegetables as long as he doesn't know that his body's needs are being fullfilled. \n\nYou didn't feed his poison. You fed him real food. He's wrong for eating wrong, he's wrong for neglecting his needs, he's wrong for basically being upset that his improved quality of life was the result of him being fed vegetables that he would outright choose not to eat if he saw them. \n\n> and said that it\u2019s none of my business if he thinks vegetables don\u2019t do anything. \n\nHe's wrong for literally harboring incorrect beliefs. \n\n> I pointed out he said he felt better. He said his health was none of my business\n\nBetter remember this when he finally  wants any kind of health-related help. Health is always a partner's business. He's literally mad that you care about him, let that sink in. \n\nAnd unless you literally tied him to a chair and forced food down his throat, you didn't control him. Decieve him? Sure. But you didn't control him. But unless he's asking for a bullet point list of every item is in a given plate of food, he willingly ate food that he didn't even ask what's in it, so it's not really deception either. And given that it's healthy food, he's no better than a toddler demanding chicken nuggets for dinner. Him being a toddler about it makes you his mommy girlfriend, this isn't an adult relationship you're in, you're parenting a mental child. \n\nHe is being a toddler, that should have been corrected decades ago. \n\nIf you are an AH for anything, it's for being with a toddler. An adult who won't willingly eat vegetables unless his gf plays mommy to get him to stop being purposely malnourished is not at all mature enough to have relationships. \n\nPlease, dump the toddler and find a man, do you really want to baby him for the rest of his life?", "No no, run. This man has less maturity than my friends\u2019 four year old. His beliefs are mindless, his diet is ridiculous, and his temper is dangerous.

Men can be such babies.", "NTA. \nI wish someone would cook for me and hide vegetables so I would eat better.

As long as it's not dangerous or wildly unexpected/abnormal you can put whatever you want in the food you cook even if it's served to others.

He's a grown man and he can eat whatever he wants but if he doesn't like what you are cooking he can make his own food. That he doesn't want to take care of his own health is pretty pathetic. He can surely blend his own veggie sauce? That said everyone has a right to know exactly what they are eating so they can decide whether to eat it. Food tampering is a violation of his autonomy however good the intention.", "I mean, you shouldn't trick people into eating things, so I guess, technically, you're the asshole? However, you need to think really hard about continuing this relationship. He doesn't think vegetables do anything? That's an odd stance for someone having to take multivitamins and prescription medications when he's not being tricked into eating vegetables. You really want to sign up for a lifetime of this? Those health problems are only going to get worse.", "I'm kind of on the fence because on the one hand he's supposed to be a grown ass adult but he just threw a giant temper tantrum and stormed out because he found out that there were vegetables in his pasta.\n\nOn the other hand, I can understand how it would be a violation of his autonomy; he may be acting like a child but he isn't one so it's his own fault that he can't grow up and eat a vegetable for his own health.  I can tell you were coming from a place of caring for him and his health but you can't control him and you can't care more about him than he does, that's not healthy either.\n\nSo, ESH", "NTA You were dishonest and manipulative, but you can actually buy spaghetti sauce that has vegetables in it so it is a normal ingredients to put in spaghetti sauce like onions, carrots, green peppers, mushrooms etc. Even blended they are legit ingredients. You knew he just didn't like the taste so if it was hidden then it was fine. Like if you started using turkey sausage to make chili because it is healthier. Most people wouldn't think it was a dealbreaker.", "ESH. He's an absolute weirdo, and you voluntarily moved in with him.", "Can I get some of these recipes??? I\u2019m working on eating more and more veggies but I\u2019ll do anything to get more in!", "The things women will do for men who literally just don\u2019t care is just embarrassing at some points. As a member of the species, STOP. He\u2019s not a dog that needs his tick antibiotics rolled up a dozen layers of swiss cheese coated in peanut butter. You\u2019re literally battling a grown man and leading a whole ass double life to get him to eat his vegetables. Please, do yourself a favor and find a guy that can handle a little broccoli once a week.", "NTA. How can people not ear vegetables?! How horrible has his parents been to not give him vegetables as a child?", "NTA. But please date someone more mature. I\u2019m a vegetarian and my husband isn\u2019t and he also ate very few vegetables before we got together but since we\u2019ve been cooking together he eats more of them voluntarily. If he had been like your bf our relationship would not have lasted.", "NTA.\n\nBlitzing veggies into a pasta sauce is pretty standard globally, whether you're actively trying to hide them or not.\n\nI think your other half has issues if that's his reaction. It's disproportionate to the situation.\n\nObviously we don't know you and the relationship, so I'm not jumping on the \"OMG leave him\" bandwagon. Only you will know if this is something that can be worked out as a blip and reconciled or if it's part of a slippery slope to unhappiness.\n\nAs a side note, I think adults that have the dietry preferences of young children (not liking vegetables and eating heaps of freezer food) do need professional help with a counsellor or therapist.", "I want to say NTA but at the same time I think went about it the wrong way by lying about removing the vegetables. I don't think the way you cooked it is wrong but it's still dishonest. \n\nThough did you ever ask him why he was against vegetables? Could be a taste thing or sensory issues. That said maybe you should have tried to find a compromise instead of going behind his back as that's not a sign of a healthy relationship even if it's for a good cause. \n\nAs for him and his sisters I don't want to call them AHs but yeah this could have been avoided with a simple conversation.", "I'd leave him.\n\nNTA", "YTA you mean well but food tampering is a crime. \n\nYou should have just discussed this with him like the adults you're supposed to be.", "YTA- tricking someone into eating something that they aren't aware of is a pretty serious breach of trust.\n\nThat being said - he sounds like a complete was of space and you don't need to put up with someone who won't look after themselves.", "ESH. On one hand, you shouldn\u2019t be tampering with his food. Id be annoyed if my partner took it upon themselves to police my food, and put in stuff that id made it very clear I didn\u2019t like. He\u2019s an adult and can make his own decisions on what he eats, even if this is at the detriment of his health. \nHe sucks for being a giant toddler. You know they make hidden veggie sauce for kids right? Directly marketed for children. \n\nI wonder why you are mothering him like this. You do all the cooking, I bet you also wash his clothes, you know, because you are doing all the laundry anyway, and most of the cleaning yeah? Because he\u2019s busy, playing Xbox or whatever\u2026. I know I\u2019m making assumptions, but this man hasn\u2019t noticed you using a blender on all his meals, so I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s not paying any attention to you at all while you cook. \nAre you planning on being responsible for this man forever? Especially such an ungrateful one.", "ESH  Why are you in a relationship with an 11 year old?", "This is tricky. I'm going with ESH, though I think he sucks far more than you. His overaction is *really* silly, but I can understand how he feels manipulated by you. Meanwhile, you had great intentions and actually helped him, but the subterfuge bothers me - the guy is an adult, and he gets to choose his own diet.", "Your boyfriend\u2019s an idiot and acting like a child. You can do better. Move on. \n\nSoft YTA as I don\u2019t think you should do this sort of thing to adults, but I do understand why you did.", "This one is a little tricky, but I'm landing in a soft YTA, but only because you lied to him about it. If you're doing the cooking, you are free to put vegetables in your food whenever, wherever and however you want. You don't have to tell him, but you shouldn't lie to him either.", "YTA. Listen. Lies and deception are no way to build a healthy relationship. You know that, he knows that, society in general knows that. So your part in this makes you the AH. However, consider what drove you to this behavior because it doesn't sound like this would be a healthy relationship even without the lying and food drama. This is what I'm getting: your much older partner is refusing to take care of himself in a way that keeps him healthy (seriously, not even supplements??) and in response you turned into his mother. How does this affect other aspects of your relationship? Is this behavior from him attractive for you? Can you see yourself building a family together with this guy?", "YTA- Maybe have a conversation with him like adults? \n\nPretty crazy that you immediately jumped to messing with his food instead of bringing up your (valid) concerns about his diet\n\n\nEdit:spelling", "ESH but I completely understand where you're coming from. My boyfriend is the same way. It sucks knowing that they don't care enough to take care of themselves, despite what it could do to you. His health is already bad that you feel like you have to take care of him. Imagine what that will be like after you get older. \n\nThat being said, you just don't mess with anyone's food behind their back. It's honestly a pretty vulnerable thing, even if it's harmless.", "I will say that hiding it is kinda manipulative. But his behavior is child like. So I would say NTA but this situation seems untenable and you should look for a new partner", "ESH. \n\nWhy are you mothering him?\n\nLet him cook disgusting food for himself. \n\nHe has to come to realise we are what we eat!\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t hide veggies with an adult", "Yikes on bikes. NAH yeah you shouldn\u2019t of lied to him? But, you also literally improved his life. He was an absolute troll about everything but I don\u2019t blame him for overreacting when he found out. I\u2019m sure from his perspective he felt embarrassed/humiliated/foolish because he didn\u2019t realize he had been eating vegetables and didn\u2019t want to admit he was wrong. \n\nTbh, I\u2019d find a new bf I didn\u2019t have to babysit though.", "YTA.  You took it on yourself to override a decision that's not yours to make.  More importantly, you deliberately misled him and then blamed him for the consequences when he found out.", "Are you his mother?\n\nYTA - You took away someone's agency over what they put in their body. Sure, you wanted him to be healthier, but you might as well have been treating him like a toddler and calling broccoli, dino trees.", "YTA. This is a ridiculous argument to have with a grown man\u2026because you are treating him like a toddler. You could have had a conversation with him about your concerns and ask if he\u2019d like your help to incorporate more vegetables into his diet. Lying to him about what he\u2019s eating is manipulative, infantilizing and unacceptable.", "YTA\n\nEasy one, really. Lying and tricking him makes you TA of course.", "YTA for intentionally tampering with his food without him knowing.", "ESH- You\u2019re not his mother and it is controlling. He\u2019s a giant toddler. Pack up, take the loss, and move on to someone else.", "ESH, but you less so than him. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to essentially lie by omission. HOWEVER, people who behave like your boyfriend are ridiculous. It\u2019s like they won\u2019t eat vegetables out of some weird principle, which has no basis in logic. People like this are just so foolish to me. Like, yes, sure. If you think vegetable = bad, then I guess you\u2019re entitled to that opinion, but seriously? Are you sure your boyfriend is 36 and not 6? It\u2019s just like you said: he\u2019s a grown man. He doesn\u2019t dislike the vegetables because he ate them just fine before you told him. He\u2019s clearly not refusing them on the basis of health as it sounds like eating them was improving his health, so again, I circle back to this weird superficial sense of superiority people like this tend to display. Honestly, his behavior is so childish that I\u2019m almost on the N T A train, but I still think lying by omission is wrong, even though your boyfriend is ridiculous and I can\u2019t believe a grown man is acting like this much of a child over some vegetables.\n\nEdit: spelling", "ESH. The main reason I'm calling you an AH in this scenario is because you kept this a secret from your boyfriend without a full understanding of his dietary preferences and without having a serious conversation like adults about why it may be a good idea to eat some veg. Instead you treated him like a child and tried to control his diet.\n\nI would be very careful about slipping other items in a partner's food. Let's say hypothetically he had some rare condition that made him allergic or intolerant to certain vegetables but never told you, you could have run the risk of causing him discomfort, pain or an allergic reaction by doing this.\n\nI mean you wouldn't slip peanuts into the dish of a partner with a severe nut allergy, would you?\n\nHe definitely overreacted in a way that's even more childish than how you've been treating him, to the point where I would seriously question whether I wanted to stay in a relationship with someone this petty. I would not be surprised if he was thinking of breaking things off with you over this too.", "YTA\u2014he is your boyfriend, not your child.  He needs to be able to make choices for himself and it is not your job to trick him into making choices that you deem more healthy for him.  Even if it is better for him, you lied to him over and over again and messed with his food so he didn\u2019t know what he was eating.\n\nHe is absolutely right that you are controlling.  It\u2019s controlling and deceptive and shows that you don\u2019t care about his wishes or trust him to make simple decisions about his body and his wishes.  This would absolutely be a deal breaker for me as I wouldn\u2019t be able to trust you anymore.  I\u2019d be afraid of being manipulated again in the future if you didn\u2019t agree with other choices of mine.", "YTA. Don't hide things in people's food.", "Technically YTA because you shouldn\u2019t be lying to people about what they are eating. But honestly I\u2019m gonna echo what was said in another comment, you don\u2019t have to live like this, you are a girlfriend to an adult not a parent trying to convince their kids to eat their veggies.", "Oh honey. If he wanted to be a grown-up, he'd have hooked up with someone older. \n\nAlso, being deceptive about his food, while done with very good intentions, may well backfire in many ways, aside from the way it has. \n\nAlso also, you can pre-prepare the vegetable puree and store in the freezer, that's how I did it when I had to hide vegetables for my children.", "*I (28f) have been with my boyfriend (36f)* \n\nTypo??\n\nAll you showed your partner is that you are sneaky and willing to go the distance to hide things from him. Not a good trait to have unless you're a magician. At the end of the day, he isn't going to trust you now. Was this whole thing worth it?", "YTA you have good intentions but he's not a child. If he wants to mess up his health it's his business. Let him know that you're not going to stay with him and watch him do it. Find someone you don't have to treat like a kid.", "YTA and a massive one at that.\n\nIf you are not happy with the way he eats you need to have a conversation with him about it, not treat him like a stubborn toddler.  Do you know why he doesn't like vegetables? Are there any he does like that you could introduce?\n\nIf he is under the care of a physician and is being treated for potential nutritional deficiencies then it's not your concern.  \n\nSome people have texture issues.  Others it's taste.  For others it's both.\n\nI absolutely hate red meat. Despise it in fact. Don't like the taste or texture and if anyone tried to sneak it into my food I would be livid. In fact, I'd be dumping them pretty quick and moving out.\n\nYou are not the AH for being concerned about hus health, but YTA for being controlling and untrustworthy.  I hope he finds someone who respects him enough to leave his dietary preferences alone, or will talk to him like an adult about any concerns and I hope you've learned not to be a deceitful girlfriend to your next boyfriend.\n\nAnd if you are adamant that he eat the veggies in the dishes you prepare and he says no, then tell him he can cook his own meals. Good grief, what is it with people who think they know better about someone else's health and then tricks them into doing things their way?", "ESH there are people who say you shouldn't lie to your kids about what you are feeding them so the same goes for this overgrown child. He is a baby and if he doesn't want to eat vegetables then you shouldn't cook dinner for him at all.\n\n(Also, blending vegetables for a pasta sauce isn't uncommon so I don't think for that dish you had to \"hide it\" you know?)", "I understand where you're coming from but you just don't sneak vegetables into food. My mother is super picky and hates vegetables, so I give her fruit and sometimes raw vegetables.  Soft YTA because there are alternatives.", "Yes YTA, and yes bf is a damned moron. Being deceived is only fun at magic shows. This is clearly the case here and the bf, stupid as he is, is clearly justified in being upset his SO has been lying to him on the daily for the past six months.", "I think I\u2019d go with ESA. He did tell you quite clearly he doesn\u2019t want to eat vegetables and assuming he\u2019s a fully functional adult, that\u2019s his choice. It\u2019s one thing if he goes to a potluck and chooses to eat a dish not knowing there might be veggies in it, but it\u2019s quite another for his partner to intentionally deceive him regarding what she\u2019s putting in the meals she\u2019s cooking when he specifically said he didn\u2019t want it in his food. I think the deceit is what makes your part in it a little disrespectful. Of course you totally did it from a place of love and caring about his health, but that doesn\u2019t make it okay to lie to someone about what you\u2019re feeding them. I honestly think you owe him an apology for not being honest. You absolutely should tell him you did it out of concern for his health and were relieved when he started experiencing a reduction in his symptoms, but that you shouldn\u2019t have been dishonest.\nPerhaps you can embark upon a journey together to introduce more variety into his diet and work on figuring out whether he might find veggies prepared in different ways more appealing. But don\u2019t shame him or tell him he\u2019s wrong for his tastes. A lot of people have sensory issues; maybe that\u2019s part of what\u2019s going on. \nI would say he also owes you an apology for losing his temper and running to his sister rather than working it out with you.\n\nEdit to say: his health IS your concern especially if you\u2019re planning on being together long-term, let alone marrying and possibly having kids with him. Doesn\u2019t he think his partner has a right to have input if he\u2019s making poor health choices? Would he say the same thing if he did drugs or drank too much? That would certainly be your concern!", "BS BS BS BS BS BS BS BS\n\nNo one knows they don't need to take their multivitamin. That is beyond stupid. And while veggies are good it would be very unlikely for a months of veggies blended into your food to make your doctor lower you medications unless they were literally prescribed vitamins (which exist, I've taken them before)\n\nAlso, his reaction sounds so made up it's not even funny. BS. What is up with the trolls on here today?", "ESH\n\nYour bf is a stupid child for his dietary choices and for not connecting the dots. \n\nYou on the other hand are a liar. You don\u2019t want to date an irresponsible person for their ignorance and health choices? This makes perfect sense!

He would sometimes eat them if we were out at a restaurant and they came as part of his meal. But he never ate them when I cooked for him. Originally I thought that maybe my cooking was the problem so I asked him if he enjoyed my food and he told me he loves my cooking. On nights I didn\u2019t cook for him, he ate exclusively frozen foods and never ate the vegetables in those either. Naturally, he has some health issues. Vitamin deficiencies etc. he had phrased it to me as if he was somehow just genetically unlucky. I believed it for a while bc idk how that stuff works but eventually it became clear to me it\u2019s because he voluntarily eats a vegetable like once a month. \n\n6 months ago I started hiding vegetables in my cooking. If I was making pasta I\u2019d put the vegetables in I\u2019d usually put in for myself, then take half out and blend it so he wouldn\u2019t notice the vegetable chunks and then tell him I\u2019d just scooped the veg out of his portion. This happens more often now we live together because I do all of the cooking. He\u2019s been telling me a lot lately he\u2019s been feeling a lot better the past few months and has even had his doctor reduce the dosage of some of his medications and he hasn\u2019t had to take his multivitamin in weeks. I kept my mouth shut because I\u2019m just glad he\u2019s feeling better and it really does me no harm to hide the veg in his food. \n\nYesterday, I was making one of our regular pasta meals (it\u2019s one that\u2019s very easy to hide at least 4 veggies in) and i was about to blend my boyfriend\u2019s portion when the blender died mid-blend. I had to serve it in all its veg chunk glory.  My boyfriend refused to eat the vegetables but when he tasted the sauce he said it\u2019s weird how it tastes the exact same even though this one has veg in it. So, I confessed. He screamed at me and called me a controlling bitch and said that it\u2019s none of my business if he thinks vegetables don\u2019t do anything. I pointed out he said he felt better. He said his health was none of my business and that I\u2019m a controlling, judgey AH and stormed out of our apartment to stay with his sister. His sister texted me to say he\u2019s fine but she agrees with. him. My friends agree it\u2019s ridiculos that he didn\u2019t eat veg but agree I\u2019m being an AH.

He just took medical advice from an ex-doctor who lost his license, who told him the healthiest diet was one where you only ate 100% red meat. He also knew what I was doing the whole time,  but he wholeheartedly believed that since he had a job outside of the house,  and I am AFAB, it was my duty to cook for him... and he knew I'd be complained,  I would stop cooking for him.", "I do sympathise also, OP's bf eats like a child, in fact my toddler eats better than him. I know there wasn't any spite or malice involved on OP 's side, but people do have a right to know what they are eating. OP was thinking about his health which did benefit from her cooking. So I'm not going to call her a AH. But I would say she's in the wrong, it's his decision what he eats or doesn't eat, not hers.", "I love noodles too, but the spaghetti squash can be better. The next day leftovers are the best!", "Mashed potato squash is good too. Hoping to get some in the garden this year.\n\nIf you like sweet potatoes, try roasted butternut with honey. It's firmer and similar sweet potato texture.", "In this instance the 'victim' is a male meat eater...\n\nI'm with you 100%, but AITA wears its collective bigotries proudly on its sleeves, and doesn't feel any compunction to wield hypocrisy with abandon.", "No it doesn't make it tampering and no it's not the same as putting an allergen in food or violating Kosher which AFAIK is more of a religious thing than a taste thing.\n\nShe modified the veggies to mix into the sauce better thus removing the distasteful large chunks. The only thing she's guilty of is making the food more appetizing. Veggies in sauces are very normal. Maybe if she put something abnormal in the food (bugs, served raccoon instead of beef, spit in the food, etc.) you'd have a point but OP just made regular food.", "That's not how it works for all. \n\nFor example: I started my life as a pure vegetarian while living with my grandparents, but later in childhood, my parents needed to force me to eat my veggies so much so that they still have stories about that. Only as an adult have I acquired a taste for them.", "Yeah that's definitely not true. I gave my daughter a wide selection of fruit and vegetables when she first started solids. She would eat almost anything. Now she refuses pretty much all vegetables that are not blended to oblivion.", "When I was little, we did not eat out very often but when we did, we always got to get an appetizer.  My parents would order us a side of veggies as our appetizers LOL.  We were hungry, and board so we at them without thinking it was not really an appetizer.", "Giving vegetables to eat and giving meat to a vegetarian are two totally different things.", ">But imagine the reactions here if it wasn't about veggies, but about serving a meat to a vegetarian.\n\nI know right. Imagine if it wasn't a meal, but a gun, and instead of vegetables, bullets. The mind boggles at the sick things the OP could have done if the facts and the situation was completely different!", "I have sensory issues and have some foods I don't want to touch out of my own volition. It's not on allergy-level of total avoidance but I absolutely loathe when I have communicated clearly thay I have issues with specific things and then without warning I find them used in meals.\n\nLike fine, I don't want to restrict anyone else's food but at least give a warning if the meal contains stuff I don't want to eat? Then I can decide what I want to do. \nSometimes I make sure to confirm what ingredients were used, sometimes I can see if it's used without asking and sometimes I don't even realize that it might have been used.\n\nI mean I can power through and eat them if I ignore the fact I'm eating it. Or I can eat around it. But that doesn't make any nicer when a person doesn't respect your boundaries, as silly as they may seem to them. My case is fairly mild as I can still force myself to eating these foods but intentionally deceiving someone into eating foods they don't want to consume? Nope. I would also lose it.", "Hiding can simply mean making them less obvious. I hide veggies in my food too b/c I dislike them. Regardless she can hide whatever she wants as long as it's not dangerous or wildly abnormal. \n\nIf nobody is allergic and nobody is a vegetarian shrimp isn't different. Was the context serving it to either of those groups?", "Lol ok, if you say so", "I'm sorry you had to deal with that.", "Now that is just a straight up lie. You will go to pasta jail for that blasphemy!", "She lied to him. She told him that she had removed the veggies from his portion.\n\nVeggies in sauce are absolutely normal. Lying isn't.", "I imagine you just eating pasta and rice. Much like my niece... \n\nMany kids go thru what our doctor called a \"white phase\" where they start only wanting that color food. It's painful.", "Its true in all the cases i know.", "Okay, I\u2019ll bite. Why is it different? The vegetarian doesn\u2019t want to eat meat, OP\u2018s boyfriend doesn\u2019t want to eat vegetables. Why is hiding one thing in their food okay, but the other is not?", "Y'all think the bf is unappealing so you're good with whatever op does...", "What's your issue? I think it's hypocritical to say it's ok to hide food just because the food in question is vegetables. But I can't have tasty meal made of bullets. That would get me to er, also I would probably loose all my teeth. So I don't see how this relates.", "Yep I'm with you and I completely understand what you mean. OP deliberately lied about veggie not being there. I am similar about some foods (although I didn't know the term sensory issues existed until I found reddit, so I have no clue what it is for me). And if I had to count all the times I thought the food was really bad and asked is there 'insert food I wouldn't eat' and was told 'no'.... So I powered through and was later told 'yeah, it was there and you can still eat it, so you must like that food'...", "But he's been eating it for months, so obviously it's not about the taste or texture, at least not in the way she was serving it to him. Would it really bother you if you absolutely couldn't tell and enjoyed it originally? Because that seems less like legitimate dislike and far more like stubborn, mindless refusal. The things you are talking about, the other reply mentioned \"powering through\", but OP's BF already expressed several times that he enjoyed it. He liked the flavor; it was just the texture and idea of vegetables he seemed to find unappealing. But she took care of that by blending them so the texture wasn't an issue anymore.", "unknown for the question. the person who was given the food hated shrimp but liked the food given. why they didnt like shrimp was omitted, there wasnt any stated medical, moral or religious reason. people unanimously agreed op was TA", "Thanks.  He was trash, but I did take the garbage out.  Just took a while for me to swallow my pride and move back to my mom's.", "I mean in a way she did. The veggies were now fully incorporated as part of the sauce instead of being distinct separate ingredients in the dish.", "She took the veggies out of his. \n\nThen she blended them up, and put them back in.\n\nLied by omission.", "You're right.", "Bullseye, just add nuggets or any other heavily processed meat, and it's complete.", "Because one is a moral imperative whereas the other is just stubborn refusal, not even because he dislikes the taste or anything. He just doesn't seem to want to eat vegetables.", "I never said what OP did was right, I just said the comparison above is wrong", "If OP knew for a fact the person wasn't allergic, a vegetarian, or had some other moral or religious stance against eating shrimp then they weren't the AH. However without seeing the post my guess is ppl voted that way b/c it wasn't clear if OP did know those things or not. \n\nBy comparison this OP has seen her boyfriend eat vegetables (although not often) so knew not eating them wasn't due to allergies or taking part in a deliberate diet. By deliberate diet I mean something like following a carnivore diet.", "She made sauces. Which he liked. The fact that they also happened to be good for him isn\u2019t the crime some people are making it out to be.", "Oh good lord. This is such hand holding bullshit. What pasta sauce with vegetables can be genuinely passed off as a sauce with no veg?", "The fact you even had to explain this makes me so disappointed in this thread. Holy shit.", "Why? What makes it wrong?", "Not a crime at all. She told the truth for the first halfbecause she did in fact remove his half of the veggies.  She just didn't keep them out.\n\nI commend her ability to disguise the veggies for that long without him catching on. That's something that you do for toddlers though... Dude should just eat some veg sometimes. You'd hope that he'd come out of this realizing that veggies are delicious instead of pissed that she fed him things he otherwise wouldn't eat.\n\nShe cooked for him and made food that she likes to make and he liked to eat. No harm done. Not any allergies, not a moral or religious reason to eat a particular way. Doesn't seem like it's a dietary thing\n. Dudes just got eating habits of a 2 year old. And deals with his emotions like one too."]}
