He would sometimes eat them if we were out at a restaurant and they came as part of his meal. But he never ate them when I cooked for him. Originally I thought that maybe my cooking was the problem so I asked him if he enjoyed my food and he told me he loves my cooking. On nights I didn\u2019t cook for him, he ate exclusively frozen foods and never ate the vegetables in those either. Naturally, he has some health issues. Vitamin deficiencies etc. he had phrased it to me as if he was somehow just genetically unlucky. I believed it for a while bc idk how that stuff works but eventually it became clear to me it\u2019s because he voluntarily eats a vegetable like once a month. \n\n6 months ago I started hiding vegetables in my cooking. If I was making pasta I\u2019d put the vegetables in I\u2019d usually put in for myself, then take half out and blend it so he wouldn\u2019t notice the vegetable chunks and then tell him I\u2019d just scooped the veg out of his portion. This happens more often now we live together because I do all of the cooking. He\u2019s been telling me a lot lately he\u2019s been feeling a lot better the past few months and has even had his doctor reduce the dosage of some of his medications and he hasn\u2019t had to take his multivitamin in weeks. I kept my mouth shut because I\u2019m just glad he\u2019s feeling better and it really does me no harm to hide the veg in his food. \n\nYesterday, I was making one of our regular pasta meals (it\u2019s one that\u2019s very easy to hide at least 4 veggies in) and i was about to blend my boyfriend\u2019s portion when the blender died mid-blend. I had to serve it in all its veg chunk glory.  My boyfriend refused to eat the vegetables but when he tasted the sauce he said it\u2019s weird how it tastes the exact same even though this one has veg in it. So, I confessed. He screamed at me and called me a controlling bitch and said that it\u2019s none of my business if he thinks vegetables don\u2019t do anything. I pointed out he said he felt better. He said his health was none of my business and that I\u2019m a controlling, judgey AH and stormed out of our apartment to stay with his sister. His sister texted me to say he\u2019s fine but she agrees with. him. My friends agree it\u2019s ridiculos that he didn\u2019t eat veg but agree I\u2019m being an AH.

This is a grown man 8 years older than you. If he has a problem with your cooking, let him make his own food.

What a donut.", "[removed]", "NTA. Why are you with a child?", "No. You are NTA in anyway, and I don't care what anyone says. I admittedly was the same way, till my girlfriend kinda got me to start. I've felt much better afterwards and just. Yea. Minus squash. I will straight up fight someone over having to eat that nasty hell food lol\n\nIf he's gonna be a cry baby about it, he can cook his food and you can cook yours. That way he can \"control what he's putting in his body\" as another comment said", "I have to disagree with everyone here, NTA. If you have to sneak in vegetables because he has an abject objection to adhering to his body's requirements to be healthy, then it's because there is something wrong with him and hs needs dragged to a doctor to address his purposeful malnutrition and a therapist to address why he insists on what is basically self-harm out of negligence. \n\nYour feeding him food that he requires to be healthy literally improved his wellbeing. So clearly he's fine with vegetables as long as he doesn't know that his body's needs are being fullfilled. \n\nYou didn't feed his poison. You fed him real food. He's wrong for eating wrong, he's wrong for neglecting his needs, he's wrong for basically being upset that his improved quality of life was the result of him being fed vegetables that he would outright choose not to eat if he saw them. \n\n> and said that it\u2019s none of my business if he thinks vegetables don\u2019t do anything. \n\nHe's wrong for literally harboring incorrect beliefs. \n\n> I pointed out he said he felt better. He said his health was none of my business\n\nBetter remember this when he finally  wants any kind of health-related help. Health is always a partner's business. He's literally mad that you care about him, let that sink in. \n\nAnd unless you literally tied him to a chair and forced food down his throat, you didn't control him. Decieve him? Sure. But you didn't control him. But unless he's asking for a bullet point list of every item is in a given plate of food, he willingly ate food that he didn't even ask what's in it, so it's not really deception either. And given that it's healthy food, he's no better than a toddler demanding chicken nuggets for dinner. Him being a toddler about it makes you his mommy girlfriend, this isn't an adult relationship you're in, you're parenting a mental child. \n\nHe is being a toddler, that should have been corrected decades ago. \n\nIf you are an AH for anything, it's for being with a toddler. An adult who won't willingly eat vegetables unless his gf plays mommy to get him to stop being purposely malnourished is not at all mature enough to have relationships. \n\nPlease, dump the toddler and find a man, do you really want to baby him for the rest of his life?", "No no, run. This man has less maturity than my friends\u2019 four year old. His beliefs are mindless, his diet is ridiculous, and his temper is dangerous. This is not someone anyone should have the misfortune to be around.\n\nNTA for making him eat like a grown up big boy, but you will be if you waste your time with someone that is so inwardly and outwardly toxic.", "I think you just need to quit acting like his mother. Also, you are dating a toddler. You are NTA for feeding him vegetables, which apparently he liked and is now having a tantrum about, but you should have had a discussion about it. He sounds incredibly immature, he is currently at his sister\u2019s house whining about how you hid veggies in his meals. I somehow doubt that this is the only aspect of your relationship where he acts like a child.", "NTA.

Finally made a meal and some was noticeable so he asked about it, I told him what I'd been doing, he laughed and kept eating. From then on I was able to stop hiding the veggies, until we had kids.", "i dated a dude like this lol the only vegetable he would eat was broccoli. & he was so fucking picky but always wanted me to cook for him.

This is a ridiculous argument. If he wants to be in control of the ingredients then tell him to cook for himself. Men can be such babies.", "NTA. \nI wish someone would cook for me and hide vegetables so I would eat better.

The best I can do is sneak chicken bouillon into the water while it cooks to help give them extra calories.", "NTA", "NTA stop cooking for him. He can make his own food.", "Him: I hate vegs but I need them because my doctor says so. I want to feel better so I will take supplements. I want both tasty food and vitamins. Omg my gf achieved that, I\u2019m so mad!!!!!!\n\nNTA lol", "NTA. As long as it's not dangerous or wildly unexpected/abnormal you can put whatever you want in the food you cook even if it's served to others. If he likes the taste of the food then what does it matter the flavor happened to come from veggies? He can cook his own meals if he wants  control over the ingredients.\n\nI'm curious what he's telling everyone tho b/c it seems odd they're all agreeing with him. That is unless they're also anti-veggie crusaders.", "NTA. Girl run.", "YTA to yourself. There is no reason to live like this. This man is acting like a four year old who won\u2019t eat his peas and instead of leaving him to find another adult to be with, you\u2019ve become his mother. You deserve way better.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nLeave him. You deserve better than him, and he and his sister deserve the health problems that he will end up with.", "Let us know when you have your own place to live again. NTA.", "ESH but mainly him. He's a grown man and he can eat whatever he wants but if he doesn't like what you are cooking he can make his own food. That he doesn't want to take care of his own health is pretty pathetic. He can surely blend his own veggie sauce? That said everyone has a right to know exactly what they are eating so they can decide whether to eat it. Food tampering is a violation of his autonomy however good the intention.", "I mean, you shouldn't trick people into eating things, so I guess, technically, you're the asshole? However, you need to think really hard about continuing this relationship. He doesn't think vegetables do anything? That's an odd stance for someone having to take multivitamins and prescription medications when he's not being tricked into eating vegetables. You really want to sign up for a lifetime of this? Those health problems are only going to get worse.", "I'm kind of on the fence because on the one hand he's supposed to be a grown ass adult but he just threw a giant temper tantrum and stormed out because he found out that there were vegetables in his pasta.\n\nOn the other hand, I can understand how it would be a violation of his autonomy; he may be acting like a child but he isn't one so it's his own fault that he can't grow up and eat a vegetable for his own health.  I can tell you were coming from a place of caring for him and his health but you can't control him and you can't care more about him than he does, that's not healthy either.\n\nSo, ESH", "NTA You were dishonest and manipulative, but you can actually buy spaghetti sauce that has vegetables in it so it is a normal ingredients to put in spaghetti sauce like onions, carrots, green peppers, mushrooms etc. Even blended they are legit ingredients. You knew he just didn't like the taste so if it was hidden then it was fine. Like if you started using turkey sausage to make chili because it is healthier. Most people wouldn't think it was a dealbreaker.", "ESH. He's an absolute weirdo, and you voluntarily moved in with him.", "Can I get some of these recipes??? I\u2019m working on eating more and more veggies but I\u2019ll do anything to get more in!", "The things women will do for men who literally just don\u2019t care is just embarrassing at some points. As a member of the species, STOP. He\u2019s not a dog that needs his tick antibiotics rolled up a dozen layers of swiss cheese coated in peanut butter. You\u2019re literally battling a grown man and leading a whole ass double life to get him to eat his vegetables. Please, do yourself a favor and find a guy that can handle a little broccoli once a week.", "NTA. How can people not ear vegetables?! How horrible has his parents been to not give him vegetables as a child?", "NTA. But please date someone more mature. I\u2019m a vegetarian and my husband isn\u2019t and he also ate very few vegetables before we got together but since we\u2019ve been cooking together he eats more of them voluntarily. If he had been like your bf our relationship would not have lasted.", "NTA.\n\nBlitzing veggies into a pasta sauce is pretty standard globally, whether you're actively trying to hide them or not.\n\nI think your other half has issues if that's his reaction. It's disproportionate to the situation.\n\nObviously we don't know you and the relationship, so I'm not jumping on the \"OMG leave him\" bandwagon. Only you will know if this is something that can be worked out as a blip and reconciled or if it's part of a slippery slope to unhappiness.\n\nAs a side note, I think adults that have the dietry preferences of young children (not liking vegetables and eating heaps of freezer food) do need professional help with a counsellor or therapist.", "I want to say NTA but at the same time I think went about it the wrong way by lying about removing the vegetables. I don't think the way you cooked it is wrong but it's still dishonest. \n\nThough did you ever ask him why he was against vegetables? Could be a taste thing or sensory issues. That said maybe you should have tried to find a compromise instead of going behind his back as that's not a sign of a healthy relationship even if it's for a good cause. \n\nAs for him and his sisters I don't want to call them AHs but yeah this could have been avoided with a simple conversation.", "I'd leave him.\n\nNTA", "YTA you mean well but food tampering is a crime. \n\nYou should have just discussed this with him like the adults you're supposed to be.", "YTA- tricking someone into eating something that they aren't aware of is a pretty serious breach of trust.\n\nThat being said - he sounds like a complete was of space and you don't need to put up with someone who won't look after themselves.", "ESH. On one hand, you shouldn\u2019t be tampering with his food. Id be annoyed if my partner took it upon themselves to police my food, and put in stuff that id made it very clear I didn\u2019t like. He\u2019s an adult and can make his own decisions on what he eats, even if this is at the detriment of his health. \nHe sucks for being a giant toddler. You know they make hidden veggie sauce for kids right? Directly marketed for children. \n\nI wonder why you are mothering him like this. You do all the cooking, I bet you also wash his clothes, you know, because you are doing all the laundry anyway, and most of the cleaning yeah? Because he\u2019s busy, playing Xbox or whatever\u2026. I know I\u2019m making assumptions, but this man hasn\u2019t noticed you using a blender on all his meals, so I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s not paying any attention to you at all while you cook. \nAre you planning on being responsible for this man forever? Especially such an ungrateful one.", "[removed]", "This is tricky. I'm going with ESH, though I think he sucks far more than you. His overaction is *really* silly, but I can understand how he feels manipulated by you. Meanwhile, you had great intentions and actually helped him, but the subterfuge bothers me - the guy is an adult, and he gets to choose his own diet.", "Your boyfriend\u2019s an idiot and acting like a child. You can do better. Move on. \n\nSoft YTA as I don\u2019t think you should do this sort of thing to adults, but I do understand why you did.", "This one is a little tricky, but I'm landing in a soft YTA, but only because you lied to him about it. If you're doing the cooking, you are free to put vegetables in your food whenever, wherever and however you want. You don't have to tell him, but you shouldn't lie to him either.", "YTA. Listen. Lies and deception are no way to build a healthy relationship. You know that, he knows that, society in general knows that. So your part in this makes you the AH. However, consider what drove you to this behavior because it doesn't sound like this would be a healthy relationship even without the lying and food drama. This is what I'm getting: your much older partner is refusing to take care of himself in a way that keeps him healthy (seriously, not even supplements??) and in response you turned into his mother. How does this affect other aspects of your relationship? Is this behavior from him attractive for you? Can you see yourself building a family together with this guy?", "[deleted]", "ESH but I completely understand where you're coming from. My boyfriend is the same way. It sucks knowing that they don't care enough to take care of themselves, despite what it could do to you. His health is already bad that you feel like you have to take care of him. Imagine what that will be like after you get older. \n\nThat being said, you just don't mess with anyone's food behind their back. It's honestly a pretty vulnerable thing, even if it's harmless.", "I will say that hiding it is kinda manipulative. But his behavior is child like. So I would say NTA but this situation seems untenable and you should look for a new partner", "ESH. \n\nWhy are you mothering him?\n\nLet him cook disgusting food for himself. \n\nHe has to come to realise we are what we eat!\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t hide veggies with an adult", "Yikes on bikes. NAH yeah you shouldn\u2019t of lied to him? But, you also literally improved his life. He was an absolute troll about everything but I don\u2019t blame him for overreacting when he found out. I\u2019m sure from his perspective he felt embarrassed/humiliated/foolish because he didn\u2019t realize he had been eating vegetables and didn\u2019t want to admit he was wrong. \n\nTbh, I\u2019d find a new bf I didn\u2019t have to babysit though.", "YTA.  You took it on yourself to override a decision that's not yours to make.  More importantly, you deliberately misled him and then blamed him for the consequences when he found out.", "Are you his mother?\n\nYTA - You took away someone's agency over what they put in their body. Sure, you wanted him to be healthier, but you might as well have been treating him like a toddler and calling broccoli, dino trees.", "YTA. This is a ridiculous argument to have with a grown man\u2026because you are treating him like a toddler. You could have had a conversation with him about your concerns and ask if he\u2019d like your help to incorporate more vegetables into his diet. Lying to him about what he\u2019s eating is manipulative, infantilizing and unacceptable.", "YTA\n\nEasy one, really. Lying and tricking him makes you TA of course.", "YTA for intentionally tampering with his food without him knowing.", "ESH- You\u2019re not his mother and it is controlling. He\u2019s a giant toddler. Pack up, take the loss, and move on to someone else.", "ESH, but you less so than him. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to essentially lie by omission. HOWEVER, people who behave like your boyfriend are ridiculous. It\u2019s like they won\u2019t eat vegetables out of some weird principle, which has no basis in logic. People like this are just so foolish to me. Like, yes, sure. If you think vegetable = bad, then I guess you\u2019re entitled to that opinion, but seriously? Are you sure your boyfriend is 36 and not 6? It\u2019s just like you said: he\u2019s a grown man. He doesn\u2019t dislike the vegetables because he ate them just fine before you told him. He\u2019s clearly not refusing them on the basis of health as it sounds like eating them was improving his health, so again, I circle back to this weird superficial sense of superiority people like this tend to display. Honestly, his behavior is so childish that I\u2019m almost on the N T A train, but I still think lying by omission is wrong, even though your boyfriend is ridiculous and I can\u2019t believe a grown man is acting like this much of a child over some vegetables.\n\nEdit: spelling", "ESH. The main reason I'm calling you an AH in this scenario is because you kept this a secret from your boyfriend without a full understanding of his dietary preferences and without having a serious conversation like adults about why it may be a good idea to eat some veg. Instead you treated him like a child and tried to control his diet.\n\nI would be very careful about slipping other items in a partner's food. Let's say hypothetically he had some rare condition that made him allergic or intolerant to certain vegetables but never told you, you could have run the risk of causing him discomfort, pain or an allergic reaction by doing this.\n\nI mean you wouldn't slip peanuts into the dish of a partner with a severe nut allergy, would you?\n\nHe definitely overreacted in a way that's even more childish than how you've been treating him, to the point where I would seriously question whether I wanted to stay in a relationship with someone this petty. I would not be surprised if he was thinking of breaking things off with you over this too.", "YTA\u2014he is your boyfriend, not your child.  He needs to be able to make choices for himself and it is not your job to trick him into making choices that you deem more healthy for him.  Even if it is better for him, you lied to him over and over again and messed with his food so he didn\u2019t know what he was eating.\n\nHe is absolutely right that you are controlling.  It\u2019s controlling and deceptive and shows that you don\u2019t care about his wishes or trust him to make simple decisions about his body and his wishes.  This would absolutely be a deal breaker for me as I wouldn\u2019t be able to trust you anymore.  I\u2019d be afraid of being manipulated again in the future if you didn\u2019t agree with other choices of mine.", "YTA. Don't hide things in people's food.", "Technically YTA because you shouldn\u2019t be lying to people about what they are eating. But honestly I\u2019m gonna echo what was said in another comment, you don\u2019t have to live like this, you are a girlfriend to an adult not a parent trying to convince their kids to eat their veggies.", "Oh honey. If he wanted to be a grown-up, he'd have hooked up with someone older. \n\nAlso, being deceptive about his food, while done with very good intentions, may well backfire in many ways, aside from the way it has. \n\nAlso also, you can pre-prepare the vegetable puree and store in the freezer, that's how I did it when I had to hide vegetables for my children.", "*I (28f) have been with my boyfriend (36f)* \n\nTypo??\n\nAll you showed your partner is that you are sneaky and willing to go the distance to hide things from him. Not a good trait to have unless you're a magician. At the end of the day, he isn't going to trust you now. Was this whole thing worth it?", "YTA you have good intentions but he's not a child. If he wants to mess up his health it's his business. Let him know that you're not going to stay with him and watch him do it. Find someone you don't have to treat like a kid.", "YTA and a massive one at that.\n\nIf you are not happy with the way he eats you need to have a conversation with him about it, not treat him like a stubborn toddler.  Do you know why he doesn't like vegetables? Are there any he does like that you could introduce?\n\nIf he is under the care of a physician and is being treated for potential nutritional deficiencies then it's not your concern.  \n\nSome people have texture issues.  Others it's taste.  For others it's both.\n\nI absolutely hate red meat. Despise it in fact. Don't like the taste or texture and if anyone tried to sneak it into my food I would be livid. In fact, I'd be dumping them pretty quick and moving out.\n\nYou are not the AH for being concerned about hus health, but YTA for being controlling and untrustworthy.  I hope he finds someone who respects him enough to leave his dietary preferences alone, or will talk to him like an adult about any concerns and I hope you've learned not to be a deceitful girlfriend to your next boyfriend.\n\nAnd if you are adamant that he eat the veggies in the dishes you prepare and he says no, then tell him he can cook his own meals. Good grief, what is it with people who think they know better about someone else's health and then tricks them into doing things their way?", "ESH there are people who say you shouldn't lie to your kids about what you are feeding them so the same goes for this overgrown child. He is a baby and if he doesn't want to eat vegetables then you shouldn't cook dinner for him at all.\n\n(Also, blending vegetables for a pasta sauce isn't uncommon so I don't think for that dish you had to \"hide it\" you know?)", "I understand where you're coming from but you just don't sneak vegetables into food. My mother is super picky and hates vegetables, so I give her fruit and sometimes raw vegetables.  Soft YTA because there are alternatives.", "Yes YTA, and yes bf is a damned moron. Being deceived is only fun at magic shows. This is clearly the case here and the bf, stupid as he is, is clearly justified in being upset his SO has been lying to him on the daily for the past six months.", "I think I\u2019d go with ESA. He did tell you quite clearly he doesn\u2019t want to eat vegetables and assuming he\u2019s a fully functional adult, that\u2019s his choice. It\u2019s one thing if he goes to a potluck and chooses to eat a dish not knowing there might be veggies in it, but it\u2019s quite another for his partner to intentionally deceive him regarding what she\u2019s putting in the meals she\u2019s cooking when he specifically said he didn\u2019t want it in his food. I think the deceit is what makes your part in it a little disrespectful. Of course you totally did it from a place of love and caring about his health, but that doesn\u2019t make it okay to lie to someone about what you\u2019re feeding them. I honestly think you owe him an apology for not being honest. You absolutely should tell him you did it out of concern for his health and were relieved when he started experiencing a reduction in his symptoms, but that you shouldn\u2019t have been dishonest.\nPerhaps you can embark upon a journey together to introduce more variety into his diet and work on figuring out whether he might find veggies prepared in different ways more appealing. But don\u2019t shame him or tell him he\u2019s wrong for his tastes. A lot of people have sensory issues; maybe that\u2019s part of what\u2019s going on. \nI would say he also owes you an apology for losing his temper and running to his sister rather than working it out with you.\n\nEdit to say: his health IS your concern especially if you\u2019re planning on being together long-term, let alone marrying and possibly having kids with him. Doesn\u2019t he think his partner has a right to have input if he\u2019s making poor health choices? Would he say the same thing if he did drugs or drank too much? That would certainly be your concern!", "BS BS BS BS BS BS BS BS\n\nNo one knows they don't need to take their multivitamin. That is beyond stupid. And while veggies are good it would be very unlikely for a months of veggies blended into your food to make your doctor lower you medications unless they were literally prescribed vitamins (which exist, I've taken them before)\n\nAlso, his reaction sounds so made up it's not even funny. BS. What is up with the trolls on here today?", "ESH\n\nYour bf is a stupid child for his dietary choices and for not connecting the dots. \n\nYou on the other hand are a liar. You don\u2019t want to date an irresponsible person for their ignorance and health choices? This makes perfect sense! So don\u2019t date them and don\u2019t move it with them.", "YTA for lying to him. \nBut why are you dating a man that doesn\u2019t eat vegetables?", "Massive YTA!!!! Don't lie about what's in someone else's food if you're making it, their preferences are their preferences. You have absolutely no right in any form of interference. If you're cooking for him, either respect his preferences or don't cook at all.

He would sometimes eat them if we were out at a restaurant and they came as part of his meal. But he never ate them when I cooked for him. Originally I thought that maybe my cooking was the problem so I asked him if he enjoyed my food and he told me he loves my cooking. On nights I didn\u2019t cook for him, he ate exclusively frozen foods and never ate the vegetables in those either. Naturally, he has some health issues. Vitamin deficiencies etc. he had phrased it to me as if he was somehow just genetically unlucky. I believed it for a while bc idk how that stuff works but eventually it became clear to me it\u2019s because he voluntarily eats a vegetable like once a month. \n\n6 months ago I started hiding vegetables in my cooking. If I was making pasta I\u2019d put the vegetables in I\u2019d usually put in for myself, then take half out and blend it so he wouldn\u2019t notice the vegetable chunks and then tell him I\u2019d just scooped the veg out of his portion. This happens more often now we live together because I do all of the cooking. He\u2019s been telling me a lot lately he\u2019s been feeling a lot better the past few months and has even had his doctor reduce the dosage of some of his medications and he hasn\u2019t had to take his multivitamin in weeks. I kept my mouth shut because I\u2019m just glad he\u2019s feeling better and it really does me no harm to hide the veg in his food. \n\nYesterday, I was making one of our regular pasta meals (it\u2019s one that\u2019s very easy to hide at least 4 veggies in) and i was about to blend my boyfriend\u2019s portion when the blender died mid-blend. I had to serve it in all its veg chunk glory.  My boyfriend refused to eat the vegetables but when he tasted the sauce he said it\u2019s weird how it tastes the exact same even though this one has veg in it. So, I confessed. He screamed at me and called me a controlling bitch and said that it\u2019s none of my business if he thinks vegetables don\u2019t do anything. I pointed out he said he felt better. He said his health was none of my business and that I\u2019m a controlling, judgey AH and stormed out of our apartment to stay with his sister. His sister texted me to say he\u2019s fine but she agrees with. him. My friends agree it\u2019s ridiculos that he didn\u2019t eat veg but agree I\u2019m being an AH.

So sadly Y T A on this, but this isn\u2019t really the issue that I think bothers you.\n\nHe\u2019s more than a bit out of touch with reality if he can overreact like that, deny how he feels better with your intervention (that I would probably do myself)- the pathological reaction seems extreme. Someone mature and secure could be pissed but would have to recognize the truth that you proved- he can eat them and they are good for him. \n\nSo on this specific small, small instance you were in the bad but overwhelmingly he\u2019s the one that needs a lot of work and self reflection, not you.", "A somewhat soft Y T A\u2026 due to consent violation. You don\u2019t feed an adult with full agency over themselves something they haven\u2019t consented to. Be it good for them or not.\n\nYour BF\u2019s also TA, because he had a complete toddler meltdown.\n\nSo I\u2019m going with ESH", "YTA. Though I will say his reaction was completely over the top, but I can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re saying he literally screamed at you, which would be alarming and cause this to be an everything sucks situation, or if it\u2019s a figure of speech. \n\nI would have said you weren\u2019t the asshole if you didn\u2019t straight up lie to him at times and tell him that you were taking the vegetables out of his portion when you were in fact sneaking it in. You could have spun it like, hey I have this idea would you be willing to try this and see if you like veggies prepared like this. He deserves to make the choice whether he wants to eat veggies even if it makes him feel sick and unwell. I can\u2019t say it\u2019s a smart idea but he\u2019s an adult and it\u2019s his choice.", "(Please read until the end before downvoting)\n\nThe way I see it you \\*might\\* be the AH for hiding things in his food, I strongly believe a healthy relationship must be build on confidence and open talk.\n\nBUT\n\nIf at 36 he doesn't know how to eat properly to the point it is affecting his health, I guess it was your last resort. I don't know where you're from but I was taught in 4thgrade (or maybe 5th) how you need to have a bit of everything in your diet to be healthy, that's how basic this knowledge is. At the same age you learn how to write and count, you learn how to properly eat.\n\nI'm even more furious because it's this same kind of man that keep the \"men are children\" idea alive. I'm not a child, most of men I know aren't... but some of them definitely are and that's not funny nor to be valued.\n\nNTA (and maybe consider dumping him, his sister can help to change his diaper while he searches for another mommy)", "On one hand, he has the right to not eat vegetables if he doesn\u2019t want to, so you shouldn\u2019t have lied. However, you also have the right to put whatever you want in your cooking, and if he has a problem with it he can make or buy his own damn food. So I\u2019m going with ESH. But I\u2019d seriously reconsider this relationship if I were you.", "WTF did you confess? He has an extreme aversion to these foods, and he may have a valid reason. Yes, he needs them. Yes, you were looking after his basic health needs. NTA for that. But you did lie to him. You did feed him these foods without his consent. He set an unhealthy boundary and you ignored it. Unless you have a medical POA, your betrayal, as well-meaning and beneficial as it may have been, is still a betrayal. Is it the worst thing ever? Doesn't sound like it. But it sure was upsetting for your boyfriend, and rightly so.  Did he react well? Nope.\n\nI hesitate at ESH.\n\nAnd I hesitate at NAH.\n\nSo here are some things for you both to consider.\n\n\\*Some people can't handle the texture of veggies.\n\n\\*Editing to add Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder and SPD (Sensory Processing Disorder)\n\n\\*And up to 20% of the population have a genetic predisposition to find vegetables disgusting to their palates.\n\n\\*And some people who couldn't stomach vegetables as kids were abused by parents who just wanted their children to have the proper nutrients.\n\nSome kids had to sit down at the dinner table at 6:00 PM and weren't allowed to leave until after 10:00 PM if they refused to eat their vegetables. They had to just sit there. No homework. No reading. No talking. They were shouted at and belittled and threatened by parents and teased by siblings who gloated over them while enjoying desserts the kids who didn't like veggies weren't allowed to have.\n\nAnd sometimes these kids were physically abused. Hit, slapped, kicked, knocked to the floor, and had food mashed into their faces, and shoved into their throats - hands over their mouths while their heads were shaken and they gagged and choked and coughed and sometimes vomited. And then had to clean it all up themselves because they were disgusting ungrateful brats who didn't know what was good for them. Look at the mess they caused.\n\nThis was my reality off and on for years. Maybe not your boyfriend's. Not once. At least I hope not.\n\nI still have an aversion to vegetables and people trying to control what I eat. I do my best. Pureeing them into the sauce is brilliant. That's one strategy that works, and I hope he learns to accept that. There are still things I just can't eat - even pureed into a sauce, or fried, or covered in bacon or cheese.\n\nWhen he calms down and you're feeling less righteous, talk this through.\n\nHugs to both of you. Really.", "You're both in the wrong\n\nYour partner doesn't need to get so wound up about vegetables unless they're allergic or sm\n\nYou could have just spoken to them rather than going straight onto hiding them in his food\n\nYou both need to grow up", "ESH - You are the asshole because you do not decide for himself, and he is the asshole because self destroying himself is not cool. \n\nYou should have talked with him and let him decide however.", "ESH. While he is a grown ass man who threw a tantrum despite liking the food and had better health from the vegetables, something doesn't sit right with the fact that you purposefully told him you scooped out the vegetables when you didn't. I think a conversation could have been had about your genuine concern for his health and showing him ways that vegetables can taste good. If he is still unwilling to eat vegetables (which I have a feeling he'd still say no) then that's on him. His health is in his own hands. I guess at least he sees the benefits of eating veggies now.", "YTA - food tampering.  Idgaf if you did it to \"help\" him or not, you do NOT F with people's food and hide ingredients. \n\n- Sincerely someone with a severe food allergy to a common herb/spice", "ESH. Yes he is being ridiculous, and others have said you really shouldn't have to deal with that. However, messing with someone's food without them knowing isn't a good thing to be doing!", "You know who hides veggies in food?  Moms do.  You are literally babying him.  You had good intentions, but he's an adult.  You should communicate with him. \n\nYou don't sound very upset that he called you a controlling b\\*\\*\\*\\*.  It's ok that he's upset about what you did, but he needs to use his words in a constructive way without resorting to name-calling.

It is reasonable to explode because someone snuck stuff into your food.", "YTA. He also sucks, and despite being the asshole in this situation you're probably the better person, but here is the thing: you hid this from him, because *you knew it was wrong*. And you knew it was wrong, because it is not okay to mess with people's bodily autonomy and to conceal secrets from them or *try to make their decisions for them*. Regardless of his dietary habits, mutual respect is the foundation for any relationship and you violated that. Everyone who is exonerating you would go absolutely apeshit if the situation was that of a guy messing with his GFs food because he wanted her to lose weight so he'd find her more sexually attractive, and rightly so. Your behavior is terrible, no reasons or excuses matter one jot. This is a very basic \"do not do this, it's wrong\", and you knew it and did it anyway. If you were sincere, you could have done it in the open, but you wouldn't even let him make his own choice honestly.", "This is the best comment I've read all week and am going to use it on someone tomorrow to see their face \ud83d\ude02", "Why would you let him speak to you this way? Gurl have some self respect.\nAlso you cook all meals? You clean too? \nYour bf is a lazy bum who can't even fwd himself. You deserve better", "YTA\n\nI agree with your logic and I love vegetables, but I also have a partner who refuses to eat vegetables - he has a reaction of outright disgust towards them. I have also tried coaxing him to try them.\n\nWhether he feels better or not, you have no right to deceive him or compel him to act against his own desires, even if you are trying to do so for his greater good. People are entitled to make poor choices about their own health. This \"ends justifies the means\" attitude is toxic behaviour, and it is a breach of trust. You *are* wilfully deceiving him, and you admit as much yourself - and so it's no wonder he considers your behaviour as controlling!\n\nReddit is inconsistent. They only favour this because the topic of vegetables is somewhere between insignificant and a nutritional good. On a more controversial subject, this website would absolutely rip you a new arsehole for your approach here."]}
