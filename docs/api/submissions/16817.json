Originally I wasn\u2019t invited, only my parents. When I found out that all the other girls in the family friend group (age range 18-22) were invited I felt really sad and excluded. Despite that, I didn\u2019t make a scene I just accepted the fact that I wasn\u2019t invited and I wasn\u2019t going to ask why I wasn\u2019t invited. \n\nAll the girls are in a groupchat (except for Phoebe) and they were all talking about what dresses they\u2019d wear to the wedding. I was asked in the chat what I was going to wear and I replied that I wouldn\u2019t be at the wedding because I was not invited. All the girls were very shocked because we all grew up close, so they were confused as to why Phoebe wouldn\u2019t invite me. I told them it was okay and that it\u2019s not a big deal. One of the girls in the groupchat \u201cNadia\u201d (F21) then said that she also wouldn\u2019t be at the wedding because she would be on a work trip that same weekend. \n\nThe fact that all the girls were shocked about me not being invited got back to Phoebe and she sent me this exact message this morning:\n\n\u201chey! we sent out invitations for the wedding earlier this month and we know it only listed your parents , but Nadia isn\u2019t going anymore so you could come if you\u2019d like! The thing is we already confirmed with the caterer the exact number of people so unfortunately there won\u2019t be seating/dinner for you at the reception. We can try to figure something out for you though! Let us know!\u201d \n\nI replied,\n\n\u201c Thank you for reaching out Phoebe, but unfortunately I cannot attend your wedding. We grew up together and the fact that I wasn\u2019t even a thought to be on the original guestlist but the other girls were, speaks volumes. We\u2019ve never had issues so I\u2019m not sure what your thought process was with that decision. I won\u2019t be accepting a pity invite just because someone else has canceled espec with the complications of seating/dinner. I wish you a beautiful wedding day and a happy marriage nonetheless . \u201c \n\nApparently that text message did not go over well with Phoebe and she started telling everyone that I was being very rude for refusing her invite and calling it a \u201cpity invite\u201d. Now everyone is telling me that I kinda deserved not to be invited. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683653803, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13d0b69/aita_for_refusing_a_pity_invite/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
