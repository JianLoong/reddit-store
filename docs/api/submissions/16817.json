Originally I wasn\u2019t invited, only my parents. When I found out that all the other girls in the family friend group (age range 18-22) were invited I felt really sad and excluded. Despite that, I didn\u2019t make a scene I just accepted the fact that I wasn\u2019t invited and I wasn\u2019t going to ask why I wasn\u2019t invited. \n\nAll the girls are in a groupchat (except for Phoebe) and they were all talking about what dresses they\u2019d wear to the wedding. I was asked in the chat what I was going to wear and I replied that I wouldn\u2019t be at the wedding because I was not invited. All the girls were very shocked because we all grew up close, so they were confused as to why Phoebe wouldn\u2019t invite me. I told them it was okay and that it\u2019s not a big deal. One of the girls in the groupchat \u201cNadia\u201d (F21) then said that she also wouldn\u2019t be at the wedding because she would be on a work trip that same weekend. \n\nThe fact that all the girls were shocked about me not being invited got back to Phoebe and she sent me this exact message this morning:\n\n\u201chey! we sent out invitations for the wedding earlier this month and we know it only listed your parents , but Nadia isn\u2019t going anymore so you could come if you\u2019d like! The thing is we already confirmed with the caterer the exact number of people so unfortunately there won\u2019t be seating/dinner for you at the reception. We can try to figure something out for you though! Let us know!\u201d \n\nI replied,\n\n\u201c Thank you for reaching out Phoebe, but unfortunately I cannot attend your wedding. We grew up together and the fact that I wasn\u2019t even a thought to be on the original guestlist but the other girls were, speaks volumes. We\u2019ve never had issues so I\u2019m not sure what your thought process was with that decision. I won\u2019t be accepting a pity invite just because someone else has canceled espec with the complications of seating/dinner. I wish you a beautiful wedding day and a happy marriage nonetheless . \u201c \n\nApparently that text message did not go over well with Phoebe and she started telling everyone that I was being very rude for refusing her invite and calling it a \u201cpity invite\u201d. Now everyone is telling me that I kinda deserved not to be invited. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I sent the link to this post and the screenshot of Phoebe\u2019s message to the groupchat. The girls are now calling out Phoebe for being fake.

It was a pity invite, her message to invite you was so out of touch I wonder how her brain works and you handled it beautifully.", "NTA.  It appears that Phoebe doesn't want to look bad in front of her chosen ones, but that throw-away invite was pathetic at best.

Even the way it was worded, \"Nadia, can't come, so now you can come if you like, but we can't feed you, but e can figure something out,\" is something you would send to someone who you would like for to not come to your wedding.

I'm SO sorry, of course you're included!\" This is the time a white lie is appropriate.", "Absolutely right. What gets me is that she wasn\u2019t even smart enough to try and make it look like an accident/oversight to save face. She\u2019s a family friend and knows the parents, so she could have acted like OP was accidentally left off a family invitation or something. At least that way she\u2019d have some deniability and could claim it was a miscommunication. I\u2019ve seen people do this and most of the time it works because it\u2019s difficult to prove the person is lying. Phoebe must not be very clever.", "Wrong.  OP isn\u2019t getting fed.  Her supposed \u201cfriend\u201d already told the caterer the number of people who would be at the wedding reception and it\u2019s been carved in stone and can\u2019t be changed.", "I'm actually in that boat right now, having just been invited to a friend's wedding that's happening at the end of THIS week. Apparently they've had some people last minute tell them that they weren't going to make it after all, but all of the food is already paid for, so now they're inviting all of the \"secondary\" people that they didn't invite in the first place. \n\nI'm not offended at all. Weddings are stressful and expensive, and having planned one myself I totally get that there has to be a line drawn somewhere when it comes to who to invite and who not to. \n\nThat said, they have a place / seat for me and my husband. If they invited us and were like \"oh but you don't have a seat lol sorry, figure it out\" THEN I would be offended.", "I think Phoebe's (very likely untrue) claim was supposed to be that she confirmed the head count to caterer after Nadja RSVP'd no.", "Simple, yet elegant. I like it!", "See, this is the answer I would have given. 'Thanks, but I'm busy.' \n\nSimple, doesn't make you look bitter and - most importantly- drives her crazy thinking 'why is she not bothered about maaahh wedddaaang?'", "Because Phoebe doesn't actually want OP there. Her story falls apart once you realize that if someone was coming and then had to cancel... there's a plate and seat open.\n\nAlso caterers never cook JUST enough food. There's always an extra plate available.", "That\u2019s what I want to know! Why wouldn\u2019t OP have Nadia\u2019s seat and plate? WTF?", "And OP. Please keep us up to date with all of the groupchat drama as the wedding approaches.", "\"Seeing as how we have a cancellation, you can come, I guess, but it will be really inconvenient for me\" is a pity invite.\n\n\"Oh shit, I'm so sorry, you were meant to be named on your parent's invite, I don't know how we missed that, of course you're invited!\" is the response that should have happened.\n\nOr, if it was intentional, 'Hey, we didn't invite you because.....'", ">a pity invite\n\n> >an \u201coh-shit\u201d invite\n\nA shitty invite?", "This. This here. She is upset she got caught at whatever and op turned her down then. That's all. \n\nStill no actual reason.  Best to be drama free and walk away as you did. Let people talk. Does it really matter?", "I don\u2019t see why Nadia responding no meant that OP could be invited, since they had already given the number to the caterers without Nadia. Were they that close to capacity on the venue that there\u2019s only space for OP if someone else couldn\u2019t go? And what was OP supposed to do during the reception, walk around until someone left so a chair was available? Use a campstool?\n\nI agree that Phoebe was embarrassed. She deserved to be.", "I might've said, \"It's ok!  Maybe I can catch your next one!\"", "Yea that whole thing about confirming with the caterer didn\u2019t really add up in my mind either. I mean the wedding is the first week of June.. but still? \n\nRegardless , I\u2019ve always known Phoebe wasn\u2019t the sharpest tool in the shed so this type of \u201cslip up\u201d isn\u2019t surprising from her.", "They will of course have a little extra, but also, not everyone who RSVP'd will show up.  It was a non-vitation.  Like, you can come sit in the corner if you really want to.  Phoebe can kick rocks.  NTA", "My caterer and venue needed final numbers and payment 6 weeks before. My decorator needed the final seating plan 3 *months* before. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are early may, so a mid-June summer wedding is feasible with the info given. I\u2019m not defending Phoebe\u2019s rudeness, but claiming it\u2019s impossible the caterer has a final count is disingenuous.", "Except the exact wording says Nadia isn't coming *anymore.*\n\nThat frees up both a seat and a plate. I can understand not having the seat, but why wouldn't OP get her plate, at the very least?\n\nThat right there proves Phoebe is lying about the catering being set in stone, despite the fact that caterers never cook JUST enough. They cook extra, in case of something going wrong.", "But weird that she'd claim to have room without Nadia; no seat and no dinner means no room.", "Agreed.", "Yes", "A shitty pity invite", "shitvite", "It was definitely a pity invite and you don't need that person in your life.NAT", "You are right in not going. And to anyone who says anything, \"I wasn't invited but I never said anything about or complained. When other people pointed it out, she said I could come because someone else canceled. I consider that a pity invite and would rather spend my time and energy on people who appreciate my presence.\"", "And how is there space for you that there wasn\u2019t before? Were they right at the allowed venue capacity before Nadia dropped out?\n\nIn my fantasy I\u2019d show up with a folding stool and a picnic basket, but in real life I wouldn\u2019t go either.", "I hope your parents don\u2019t go either.", "Mmh, sharp as a marble that one.", "Stand in the corner. There\u2019s no seat for OP either.", "Right? No professional caterer would be all, oops, we dropped a plate so no food for you.", "The \u201cinvitation\u201d states the following:\n\n\u201chey! we sent out invitations for the wedding earlier this month and we know it only listed your parents , but Nadia isn\u2019t going anymore so you could come if you\u2019d like! The thing is we already confirmed with the caterer the exact number of people so unfortunately there won\u2019t be seating/dinner for you at the reception. We can try to figure something out for you though! Let us know!\u201d\n\nNote where it states:\n\u201cThe thing is we already confirmed with the caterer the exact number of people so unfortunately there won\u2019t be seating/dinner for you at the reception.\u201d\n\nSo while a cancellation usually means a seat and dinner has become available, in this case, for some reason, it doesn\u2019t. \n\nAnd of course Phoebe has lied multiple times.", "Ah, you're right. Well OP mentioned Phoebe isn't the sharpest pencil in the box.", "Somehow there is space because Nadia dropped out, but there still is no space on dinner? Was Nadia not invited to that? Is the ceremony so space restricted there wouldn't have been space for one extra? And dinner reception even more so?\n\nI'm really confused. This all reads as Phoebe really not wanting OP there but caving for ceremony too try and appear as accommodating.\n\nWhat was her game plan there had this not been brought up, just claim OP randomly didn't show up?", "Proof!"]}
