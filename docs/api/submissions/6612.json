This didn\u2019t actually happen before we closed on the house so we used the money they gave us to add a bathroom to the 1st floor for them. That money is now gone and they have lived with us for 18 months so we decided to ask them for rent to cover 40-50% of our utilities (gas, electricity, water, trash, internet). The rent we are asking is no more than 20% of their monthly income. We don\u2019t need NEED the money but it would help to get some of our other debts paid off more quickly. \n\nWhen my husband talked to them he explained our utilities and asked them to pay their portion.

She is exhibiting some signs of dementia, but I feel odd praying that she passes bf it comes to the point that we have to make some hard choices. \n\nSo maybe you and your spouse should talk about this aspect. And then depending on what you decide, maybe talk with your parents to make sure you\u2019re all on the same page. Also have the hard discussions about end of life choices. I don\u2019t know where you are located, but make sure you have proper paperwork signed now. Here in US, it\u2019s called a power of attorney and medical POA though the technical names may vary from state to state. Even if they\u2019re mentally competent now, these papers can be held in reserve until the time they are needed. My parents prepared theirs before they moved in with us. It has made the progression of life changes so much easier. I just keep a stack of copies of the POA & MPOA on hand to take with me every time we go to a new facility. And they are scanned as jpg\u2019s on my desktop so I can send them to agencies or companies showing I am authorized to talk for her. \n\nIf I could go back in time, truthfully, I would just pay the stupid utilities in full and not worry about it bc guess what? I\u2019m paying the utilities in full now, along with all her food, laundry, etc. So, maybe consider your long range situation instead of just the harsh pinch of inflation now. If I\u2019ve learned anything in my 70 years and my business training, it\u2019s that there\u2019s a lot of ups & downs and a person needs to be sure to look at long term, often hidden costs and benefits and weigh those against the short term, in your face obvious choices. \n\nBest of luck.", "How so?\n\nParents sold there house to give Op a presumably large amount of money.

Will living with you cut them off from things like help with medical care/bills? NAH but I think you *all* need to look at your finances.

On top of that mom is picking up and watching the older child every day, which would average about $250 a week if paying a service, so that's an additional $1000/month OP's saving on childcare.  That alone should more than cover any financial obligation for paying rent.  Mom is probably also taking on a lot of responsibility even when OP and her partner are home during the week and on weekends.

Don\u2019t go 50-50 equity. It\u2019s YOUR home and yours and your husband\u2019s responsibility to pay for, not your parents.

How much have the utilities actually raised in the time they\u2019ve been there? Once you have that number, you should consider the amount of childcare they\u2019re providing (I would recommend looking into childcare calculators for after school care as well as all day care. It\u2019s not uncommon for child minding to be undervalued as it often is for stay at home parents. This might give you a clearer picture of how much they\u2019re contributing to the household). I would consider the groceries to be a moot point, both you and your parents are buying groceries.

I would def. vote for AH if they are asking for rent (and also think the estimation of their financial benefit of 2 days/week and afterschool care is way undervalued, but also read this as  they ARE and will be getting free rent and am going to assume the bathroom add on was primarily for the parents (because I am sure they prefer not to share one).  I actually think a utilities request (at least for the basics that will have increased substantially with additional people\u2026perhaps not internet, cable etc. they would pay anyway), might ease the concern with asking parents to  conserve and eliminate any resentment over that.  Perhaps a sit down expressing great appreciation for child care and that of course they wouldnt charge RENT, but that a contribution towards increased utilities (water, heat, air based on percent of usage 1/3?)  would help them not feel like they would want to regulate their use.  Of course if all heat, cooling is out of the control of the parents and their comfort is not considered that might not be appropriate either.  Having had family members stay with me that treat utilities as if they were costing nothing, addressing it might help matters.  I also think the parents may be a bit stuck even without the bathroom add-on money as rent and utilities would be far more than 1/3 of utilities.  It sounds like this was a plan, to assist with childcare and live in and ideally contributing towards utilities should have been discussed in advance.  So, OP needs to evaluate whether if after reasonable discussion and a look at their own finances whether  the additional utilities cost is really worth losing all the child care help, which is not only a large cost and convenience (picking up kids from school alone is a huge help and if it is every day limits their ability to do things outside the house as well and is pretty constraining on the parents (their ability to travel etc).  It is a big adjustment to live with additional adults in a house and I hope it all works out.", "YTA. It sounds like you will put them out anyway when your new debts are paid. You\u2019re so selfish that you have not thought ahead.

How you could ever look your parents in the eye right now is astounding.", "YTA. Not only are you saving money on free childcare and got a bathroom added to your house which will add resale value, you asked 2 of the 6 people living in your house to pay 40-50% of the utilities? It was rude to ask them at all but you should be paying the majority share of the utilities since there are 4 of you and 2 of them. If the agreement was they would have moved out by now and haven\u2019t then asking for a contribution might be understandable but you did not indicate this was the case.", "YTA, your parents saving you way more than $300 a month. You are severely under estimating that cost. Especially since she is picking your daughter up from school and then providing additional childcare. \n\nThey sold their home to provide you and your children with a better life. Even if you didn\u2019t need it, that was their intention. You are missing the fact that they put themselves in a financially poor position for your benefit and they still continue to help you. \n\nHere is the bigger issue that you aren\u2019t getting. Since your parents no longer own property they have no financial gain. This also means, should one of your parents need medical care they cannot afford they will be asked to show proof they can pay that. Since they can\u2019t because they have almost no net worth and no property to mortgage they will not able to receive what could be life sustaining treatment.  (I am assuming you live in America just based of your self entitlement.) \n\nThey also have no ability to purchase a new home now. They have no true income and they gave you a huge lump sum of money. \n\nYour parents no longer owe you for the life they gave you. Stop milking a dead horse. Consider truly how much your parents are already contributing to your household. You have two right choices. First, apologize and tell your mom you were wrong. You needed to reflect on how much she is contributing to your household and asking you to contribute to rent when you don\u2019t NEED it is not acceptable. Second option is to co-sign on an affordable home for your parents and given them a down payment and then pay them for the childcare they are providing.  The wrong choice is continuing with what you\u2019re doing. I hope you have siblings that are willing to treat your parents like human beings so they can get away from you.", "YTA. Damn.

And you said you don't need the money - it would be different if them moving in caused your bills to exceed your budget.\n\nAlso they are 2 people compared to your 4 person family, so AT BEST you could ask for a third of the utilities, but 40-50 is too much, and I don't think you should be asking for anything at all.", "One of the biggest YTA this week.\nAs Greta would say, \u201cHow dare you\u201d!", "YTA\n\nThey help out with childcare, and sold their house to help you buy yours, which went into bathroom renovations, and you have the audacity to ask for MORE?!?", "YTA!!!!
