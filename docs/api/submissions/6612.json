My husband and I have hybrid work positions and can work from home so typically one of us is home at least 4 of the 5 work days. They sold their home to help us with our down payment. This didn\u2019t actually happen before we closed on the house so we used the money they gave us to add a bathroom to the 1st floor for them. That money is now gone and they have lived with us for 18 months so we decided to ask them for rent to cover 40-50% of our utilities (gas, electricity, water, trash, internet). The rent we are asking is no more than 20% of their monthly income. We don\u2019t need NEED the money but it would help to get some of our other debts paid off more quickly. \n\nWhen my husband talked to them he explained our utilities and asked them to pay their portion. My mom said she thought she wouldn\u2019t need to pay rent because she watches our kids (as already explained) and simply said I\u2019ll have to look at our finances and then hid in her room fuming the rest of the day.

OP is TA but there\u2019s also a little bit of ESH", "The bathroom is for her parents if I\u2019m not mistaken .", "So you've already talked about this and are going back on the agreement now that the lump sum is gone!?\n\nThis is getting more and more evil the more of your comments I read, holy hell.", "Did you not answer your own question with this specific statement?\n\nI forbid you and your corny spouse from doing this. It\u2019s really trashy of you.\n\n\nGreedy.", "How are YOU helping take care of your dad? You've already taken their money and using your mother as an au pair, free of charge. Were they good parents? Did were they always there for you? Mine weren't, and even I wouldn't have asked for them to give me a dollar for utilities. How do you sleep at night, SMH.", "AND your mom chose 1 of these options AH! So why do you want to punish them now in their old age by going back on your words ?? There was a long term plan that you both agreed to and now you want to change that? Because you need extra money? How and why TF is that your parents problem? Go get another part time job you hypocrite!", "Doesn\u2019t matter. You still made them sell their house. Give you a lump sum of money. And force them to watch your kids.\n\nOmg you are the devil himself. Who does this to their parents. Especially parents who actually help them out so much.", "So they paid you to move in and work for you for free and now you're asking for more? This can't be real.", "If they pay rent you should pay her for childminding. Not just the 300$/month either, she deserves an hourly rate including all the after-school hours.", "If OP didn\u2019t want to concern themselves with their parents retirement plans, they shouldn\u2019t have taken the money from their parents house sale.", "I feel like that was pretty obvious when they SOLD THEIR HOUSE AND GAVE YOU THE MONEY. Of course they plan to stay there indefinitely, they have given you most of their assets?", "Your dad is disabled and your mom is retired. Meaning they don\u2019t have jobs! Their income is their retirement and savings! Why do you want that? You KNEW they were going to live with you forever when they sold their house TO HELP YOU. Stop playing dumb and naive. If you didn\u2019t wanted them to live with you forever you should have STOPPED them from selling their house. But why would you when you got free money. \n\nThe solution is that they pay for their own food and personal stuff like clothes and skincare and hygiene products.", "I certainly would. Sorry, honey, I have to get a part time job so I can pay rent! Hope you can get childcare but honestly it's not my responsibility and I am *so sorry* that your disabled father and I have been such a burden! \n\nTo me it sounds like OP found out that she doesn't like the arrangement and is slowly turning the screws to get them to leave. She got her cash infusion, why else would she keep them around?", "If that is what your parents wanted, they wouldn't have sold their goddamn house and given the money they got from that to you. They expected you to take care of them until the end, hence why they gave you all that money and childcare.\n\nIf they wanted to go into a nursing home, or knew you were going to be this heartless, they would have kept the money themselves and used that to go to a nursing home. Now you've taken that money and *still expect them to pay for a nursing home themselves*.\n\nFucking hell.", "I\u2019d like to add something to this if I may. I am 70YO and the primary caretaker of my 92YO mom. Why? Bc my dad, a retired CPA, blew through all their $ due to his dementia before any of us realized it. (He always handled the $ and didn\u2019t really question him. By the time we realized how serious the problem was, it was too late.) \n\nAnyway, he has passed away, thankfully fairly quickly bf we faced the long journey, but now I am having to handle my mom virtually alone (w/o siblings) instead of enjoying **my** retirement. \n\nNot sure about other areas but here in Texas a nursing home avgs ~$4K/m. Our only option would be a Medicaid home.  I wouldn\u2019t put *anything* I love in a local Medicaid facility if I had any choice. \n\nI may not have a choice. Should she become bedridden and incontinent, I will have to be the one to clean and turn her, which I cannot do. And none of us can afford 24/7 nursing care. So I\u2019m not sure what we\u2019ll do. She is exhibiting some signs of dementia, but I feel odd praying that she passes bf it comes to the point that we have to make some hard choices. \n\nSo maybe you and your spouse should talk about this aspect. And then depending on what you decide, maybe talk with your parents to make sure you\u2019re all on the same page. Also have the hard discussions about end of life choices. I don\u2019t know where you are located, but make sure you have proper paperwork signed now. Here in US, it\u2019s called a power of attorney and medical POA though the technical names may vary from state to state. Even if they\u2019re mentally competent now, these papers can be held in reserve until the time they are needed. My parents prepared theirs before they moved in with us. It has made the progression of life changes so much easier. I just keep a stack of copies of the POA & MPOA on hand to take with me every time we go to a new facility. And they are scanned as jpg\u2019s on my desktop so I can send them to agencies or companies showing I am authorized to talk for her. \n\nIf I could go back in time, truthfully, I would just pay the stupid utilities in full and not worry about it bc guess what? I\u2019m paying the utilities in full now, along with all her food, laundry, etc. So, maybe consider your long range situation instead of just the harsh pinch of inflation now. If I\u2019ve learned anything in my 70 years and my business training, it\u2019s that there\u2019s a lot of ups & downs and a person needs to be sure to look at long term, often hidden costs and benefits and weigh those against the short term, in your face obvious choices. \n\nBest of luck.", "How so?\n\nParents sold there house to give Op a presumably large amount of money.  Mom watches the kid 8 days a month ( which Op is crediting at $37 a day).  And zero credit for picking the other kid from school and watching her for hours.   Adding a bathroom is in the 10s of thousands \n\nHad op asked for rent before they sold their house that would be one thing.", "If the parents move out it\u2019s not going with them", "Man I Don\u2019t even see anything about a bathroom in your post my Reddit has been responding to random people today but that response was meant for someone else who said they have a new bathroom for themselves when she states it\u2019s for the parents . But I\u2019m probably not gonna find it lmao, sorry for replying to this comment and not making sense tho.", "Still not OPs problem. They offered the money, doesn\u2019t mean OP has to help fund their parent\u2019s retirement. We do not owe our parents anything, and they are not our responsibility when they get older. If they can\u2019t figure out their own retirement, that\u2019s on them. They can live on the streets, still not OPs problem. When you live with someone else, you should pay rent, period.", "Okay, so you want OP to kick their parents out after they provided OP with a large sum of money that they got from *selling their house*, providing $300/month worth of childcare, and general help around the house, while only expecting OP to house them in return?\n\nJesus Christ that's absolutely heartless.", "Less; children and households with children need more cleaning, more frequently. Plus all the extra laundry. Older folks who don't get around as much might shower every other day and only do laundry as needed.", "Yeah, but by this post it doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019ll be moving out , which is totally okay. I mean I feel like it\u2019s just her prerogative . Me personally? I wouldn\u2019t charge my parents for rent , they\u2019ve never charged me for rent ( although I move out at 17) , so I\u2019d extend the same courtesy out to them not making them when I\u2019m the responsible one with the payments .", "Woah cold blooded...", "Not really. Just being real. We do not owe our parents anything. They decided to have us, not the other way around. I do not understand this mentality where people think they have to help out their parents when they get older, cause it\u2019s not right.", "They benefit from having a house with an additional bathroom that substantially improves its value.\n\nUnless parents are on title to the house OP & Co. are the ones benefitting from both his and child care worth much more than $300/month (and I just don't believe that child care several days a week is $75 per week as OP claims) plus pickup from school etc.", "Gee, maybe because they raised us for at least 18 yrs smdh. You need a heart and therapy.", "Thank you, it was late and my math just wasn\u2019t mathing!"]}
