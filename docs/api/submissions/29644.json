I was gone on him for a long time. We were planning to move in together until he dumped me over a FB message one night, saying he\u2019d stopped being in love with me about 8 months prior but had no idea how to dump me \u201cwithout entirely ruining my life\u201d (his words). This means he strung me long for 8 extra months (including an anniversary trip) while I was oblivious. This was in 2017. \r  \nIt messed me up hard. I\u2019m autistic and terrible at reading people, so after that text, I spent nearly 2 years paranoid than any signal I read off of anyone would be misread, and everyone I knew was always lying about liking me. It took a lot of therapy just to be able to open up to anyone again. \r  \nI left the state in 2019. I decided I would only feel okay dating again if I started over from scratch. I surprised myself when I found a relationship less than a month after moving west with a great man we\u2019ll call Tom (M, 33). It\u2019s been four years, he\u2019s wonderful and honest with me, and we live together with plans on getting engaged next year if our finances line up. \r  \nSam\u2019s father FB\u2019d me about a week ago and said that Sam is in the hospital with pneumonia, and unless he improves soon, he may be put on a ventilator, and his odds once they do that don\u2019t look too good. He wants to clear the air with some people in case things turn for the terminal, and I\u2019m on his list of people he wants to apologize to. Could I drive back for a day to listen to what he has to say? \r  \nWhen I read the message, I had a panic attack at the thought of going back and seeing him again. I have not replied yet. I would rather drive my car off a bridge than see Sam again in any capacity. The very thought of him makes me want to run into Tom\u2019s arms before I start reliving my trust issues. I\u2019ve spent years enduring the insecurities he left me with, fighting them off, moving away, and starting over. \r  \nTom doesn\u2019t think I owe Sam anything and that if this was something he truly regretted, he would have tried to reach out to me before being on his possible-deathbed. Tom\u2019s naturally skeptic, and he said this smells performative, but IDK I don\u2019t trust myself to read subtext enough. \r  \nMy mother thinks I need to respect a possibly-dying man\u2019s wishes because at this point, why would he lie anymore? She doesn\u2019t think it\u2019ll do harm to either of us, and it would show grace on my part to bring peace to him in his last days (if it ends up being so, again he\u2019s not terminal yet from the sound of it\u2026just a pessimistic prognosis right now).\r  \nI hadn\u2019t thought about Sam since starting my life with Tom outside of the therapy that helped me move on. I love my new home, it\u2019s amazing how perfectly my romantic life, as well as my career and hobbies, fell into place once I settled down. I haven\u2019t even SEEN Sam since the breakup in 2017. I didn\u2019t think he thought about me anymore either. \r  \nSo\u2026would I be TA if I refused to go see Sam, esp if he\u2019s dying?

I would also suggest, if you haven't already, go back into therapy for a few sessions.

You said you\u2019d rather drive off a bridge than to see him, so that is your answer. Don\u2019t see him. \n\n It\u2019s ok to do what\u2019s best for you. No outside input needed.", "NTA. You owe him and his guilt nothing. This isn\u2019t even about you, it\u2019s another situation about him at your expense. I know it\u2019s probably viewed as taboo, or w/e, but just because someone is dying/sick, doesn\u2019t mean that you need to respect their wishes in regards to situations like this. He just wants to feel better so that if he does pass away he doesn\u2019t feel guilty for stuff he chose to do. \nIMO it should not take the end of your existence to be the only reason you try to fix wrongs you\u2019ve done.", "You do not owe this joker absolution, even if he is on his death bed.   \n\n\nYou are living your best life without any interference from him. If he's that keen on an apologize he can write you a letter (that you can burn without reading if you choose to). Don't allow HIS need for forgiveness to override YOUR need for peace. (For the record, I think Tom is right, this sounds performative AF)  \n\n\nNTA", "NAH.\n\nA potentially dying man wants to make amends and his father is trying to help him do so. Unless ulterior motives are expected, this is a very reasonable request.\n\nOn your end, people are not required to accept apologies. It's great when formerly terrible people try to make amends, but part of that is understanding that not everyone is going to accept or even want to hear them.\n\nHOWEVER, you haven't really said anything terrible that Sam did and I think you are taking your own issues and painting him in a bad light. Guess what? Everyone spends some time thinking about a breakup before they actually do it (baring some kind of discovery like cheating or whatever). People do fall out of love or realize that the relationship isn't what they want for the rest of their lives, and that's completely reasonable. But that realization doesn't happen instantly, it's a slow process. It's not like he suddenly decided that he didn't love you and then planned to trick you for 8 months, he probably only realized it after being unhappy for a while and then looking back at the prior months. And even once you come to that conclusion, taking some time to make sure it's what you actually want, whether it's worth trying to change things, and eventually deciding how to actually break up all take time too. YOU have an issue with it because of your own hang-ups, but someone spending 8ish months (after 3+ years of being tog3ether) trying to decide if a relationship is worth saving is not terrible behavior, coming to that decision is hard. Your inability to realize there were issues in the relationship or that he was pulling away does not make him a bad person.\n\nThe only crappy thing he did is doing it over FB, but I'd hardly deny someone a deathbed request over that bit of poor judgement.", "you don\u2019t owe anyone anything just because you are ex\u2019s. if you don\u2019t want to then you don\u2019t have to. do what you need for you. good luck for whatever you decide.", "The relationship and trust issues *are* on Sam, letting things go on for 8 months longer and then on top of it saying to OP that he purpousfully lead her on for almost a year although he know it would be over would have taken a toll on anyone and on an autistic person that already has a hard tine getting social cues it's even worse. Sam is an AH through and through and *if* he actually dies he shoukd do so knowing that because you can make a mistsje yes but doing something ovwr a time span of 8 months is not a mistake, it's a plan to purpousfully suck. NTA", "No I wouldn't write something like that, it's just unnecessarily cruel and would be worse than what Sam did to the OP - which was bad, but he's not evil or anything.\n\nI'd probably just write, decline, wish them well and leave it at that.", "Your mother is the only AH in this situation. She doesn\u2019t think it\u2019ll do harm to either of you, but from the way you're describing it, you are very likely to be emotionally harmed. Don't do this to yourself, decline politely and if your mother insists, shut her down.", "op, your mother might be very nice the rest of the time, but in this situation she's the only arsehole\n\nit absolutely will do you harm and you don't owe him any grace", "Yes you could say that you have moved on with your life and don\u2019t need an apology from him.  If he writes a letter to clear his mind, that would be fine.  (It can go straight into the circular file under the kitchen sink).", "We're talking about Sam's dad here. Why on earth would you be cruel to a man who never wronged you while his son is sick?", "Perfect"]}
