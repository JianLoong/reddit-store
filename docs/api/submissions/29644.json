I was gone on him for a long time. We were planning to move in together until he dumped me over a FB message one night, saying he\u2019d stopped being in love with me about 8 months prior but had no idea how to dump me \u201cwithout entirely ruining my life\u201d (his words). This means he strung me long for 8 extra months (including an anniversary trip) while I was oblivious. This was in 2017. \r  \nIt messed me up hard. I\u2019m autistic and terrible at reading people, so after that text, I spent nearly 2 years paranoid than any signal I read off of anyone would be misread, and everyone I knew was always lying about liking me. It took a lot of therapy just to be able to open up to anyone again. \r  \nI left the state in 2019. I decided I would only feel okay dating again if I started over from scratch. I surprised myself when I found a relationship less than a month after moving west with a great man we\u2019ll call Tom (M, 33). It\u2019s been four years, he\u2019s wonderful and honest with me, and we live together with plans on getting engaged next year if our finances line up. \r  \nSam\u2019s father FB\u2019d me about a week ago and said that Sam is in the hospital with pneumonia, and unless he improves soon, he may be put on a ventilator, and his odds once they do that don\u2019t look too good. He wants to clear the air with some people in case things turn for the terminal, and I\u2019m on his list of people he wants to apologize to. Could I drive back for a day to listen to what he has to say? \r  \nWhen I read the message, I had a panic attack at the thought of going back and seeing him again. I have not replied yet. I would rather drive my car off a bridge than see Sam again in any capacity. The very thought of him makes me want to run into Tom\u2019s arms before I start reliving my trust issues. I\u2019ve spent years enduring the insecurities he left me with, fighting them off, moving away, and starting over. \r  \nTom doesn\u2019t think I owe Sam anything and that if this was something he truly regretted, he would have tried to reach out to me before being on his possible-deathbed. Tom\u2019s naturally skeptic, and he said this smells performative, but IDK I don\u2019t trust myself to read subtext enough. \r  \nMy mother thinks I need to respect a possibly-dying man\u2019s wishes because at this point, why would he lie anymore? She doesn\u2019t think it\u2019ll do harm to either of us, and it would show grace on my part to bring peace to him in his last days (if it ends up being so, again he\u2019s not terminal yet from the sound of it\u2026just a pessimistic prognosis right now).\r  \nI hadn\u2019t thought about Sam since starting my life with Tom outside of the therapy that helped me move on. I love my new home, it\u2019s amazing how perfectly my romantic life, as well as my career and hobbies, fell into place once I settled down. I haven\u2019t even SEEN Sam since the breakup in 2017. I didn\u2019t think he thought about me anymore either. \r  \nSo\u2026would I be TA if I refused to go see Sam, esp if he\u2019s dying?

I would also suggest, if you haven't already, go back into therapy for a few sessions.

I would've asked to send a thoughtful reply about him recovering well and apologizing for not being able to visit him, but seriously, F that. People always judge no matter what, and who knows what they'll do if they have something in writing from you.", "YWNBTAH\n\nYou don't owe him anything, dying or not. And like you said, if he was really interested in making amends, he wouldn't have waited until he was possibly dying to do so. Also, he could write a letter, send a card, text, whatever. He doesn't need to see you face to face. And he is not deserving of your consideration, especially at the cost of your own mental health, after the way he treated you.", "You don't owe him any of your time.  In that regard, if you choose not to go, you will not be the asshole.  \n\nI do urge you though, not to reconsider, but in making your decision consider how you believe you will feel about the person looking back at you in the mirror if you do not.  \n\nI can't tell you what you need to do.  I can't even necessarily tell you what I would do.  Clearly your past relationship with him is still traumatic for you.  When you are deciding you should also look at if it will be traumatic for you if you don't go and he dies.  \n\nHonestly, based on how long it's been and your physical reaction to the request, I think if you can pull it off you might consider seeing a therapist to help you sort out your trauma from then and your feelings about it now.  This is the best way to determine what choice is best - not Reddit.  \n\nWhatever you decide... good luck!", "NAH, i feel like you're taking it a bit too far for essentially saying you had PTSD because he broke up via Facebook. It's definitely a shitty behavior but come on he didn't kill anyone or something like that. Except if he was violent and you didn't say it in your post.\n\nNow you're saying you are even going to therapy even years later because of this. Maybe listening to his apologies would actually help you feel better more than it would help him.", "NTA - you don\u2019t have to respect anything at all and if he wants to apologize so bad he\u2019s welcomed to write a letter that his good o\u2019l dad can drive all day and night to hand deliver it. \n\nThen when you get it you don\u2019t have to open it or do anything with it.\n\nWhat he did to you is his and your trauma respectively to deal with and y\u2019all don\u2019t owe one another anything on the other side of it.\n\nYou do you because ultimately only you can process your own emotions and traumas.", "NAH,\n\nHis father is respecting his son's wishes, because it is possible that's his dying wish.  \nYou on your hand, does not wishes to meet him again, wich is perfectly understandable given your history.\n\nJust don't unload your feelings to the dad, he has to process what's happening, and what happened between you and your ex is not for him to know.\n\nI'd say, you thank him for having reached out as per his son's request, you wish him the best but can't be there. No need to explain further, and no need to dig up the past.\n\nBest of luck OP, and best of luck for Sam despite his past behavior.", "NTA - decline politely and ask him to send you a letter through snail mail as it would mean so much more to you.", "Sometime if you forgive. It's let's the weight off you.", "Will be banned for this but if my ex was dying, I would visit her alright", "NTA - You should prioritize your well being above this man that hurt you. His father isn't the AH for conveying the message. But it's a choice. You don't have to do anything. You get to make a choice. It's sad that a man has a list of people he needs to apologize to but it is not your responsibility to obviate his guilt or make yourself available to people that want to apologize to you.", "NTA, don't go, the asshole is still trying to pull your strings, what's the saying about assholes that death doesn't change them to a good person.  You do not owe him anything, especially grace.  Block his Dad on FB and don't respond.  Stick with your honey..", "No. Fuck Sam. You owe him nothing and visiting him would be damaging to you. Don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t even respond.", "NTA, \n\nIt's not your job to clear his conscience and make him feel better at the risk to your own mental health.  \n\nYou have the option of ignoring the request or replying to his father that unfortunately you are unable to come but wish him the best.", "Tell the dad u hope Sam dies", "NTA\n\nEverything Tom said in the lower paragraphs covers my thoughts exactly, if he truly had any care or thought he wouldn't have waited till his possible deathbed. \n\nPersonally, I'd politely decline the offer and express your well wishes. It's a chapter of your life that closed a long time ago,focus on the present.", "NTA. You have your own mental health and peace of mind to take care of. Put yourself first and say NO.", "I\u2019d just say to his dad you accept his apology, it\u2019ll help you as you can stop thinking about it, which is the best thing for your mental health, also it\u2019ll stop any guilt from creeping in ( which it always seems to do where a death is concerned).  And it would stop any talk about going to see him", "NTA\n\nI would probably have been petty and told him just that\n\"I would rather drive my car out of a bridge than see him in any capacity\" but that's also largely do to the fact that his not doing it because his sorry, if I was, he would have done it before he was about to leave this world.", "NTA\n\nyou aren\u2019t obligated to do that, even if other people think it\u2019s mean if you don\u2019t. you shouldn\u2019t have to face someone who hurt you so deeply just to make them feel better. it\u2019s sad that he\u2019s dying and i feel for his family, but you don\u2019t owe them anything. don\u2019t feel bad if you don\u2019t go, i honestly don\u2019t think i would", "NTA.  Tom is right about if he truly regretted it he would of reached out further.  IMO, its a selfish act when people do these acts on their death beds.  They're doing it for their OWN piece of mind rather than doing it for the other person.  Just so they can die in peace.  If you're happy now and this is going to cause pain, anxiety, and drudge up negative emotions for something you worked years to undo then I think it isn't worth it.", "Thank you for the graceful criticism. If I decline, I don't intend to say anything disrespectful about him. Just \"I wish the best for all of you but I cannot be there.\"\n\nHis father is actually a very nice man, I would never do that to him regardless", "That last bit is the most important. You have no obligation to see anyone or do anything other than the obligation we all have twords being decent to others. The father here is doing his best for his child who is passing away. I wish you the best", "She could block, ghost, or slam the guy and I wouldn't mind. He is, and will forever be, the AH", "She doesn't owe him even a fake apology. The right thing is to put herself first and not let Sam take any more of her energy. Fuck his peace", "If he can end a four year relationship in a facebook message he can say whatever he needs to say to her now with a facebook message.", "Sounds like HE\u2019S the fragile one, if he\u2019s tracking down people he\u2019s wronged to disrupt their lives.", "IFeel free to copy from the below however you wish - including not at all.\n\n\"Hey [Sam's Father],\n\nI'm sorry to hear Sam is so sick. I am not available to see him, but I wish you and the family all the best.\"\n\nGenerally, I'd aim for kind, but utterly neutral. You don't need to tell Sam's father about your trauma or recovery, just express your condolences and decline to visit.", "Perfect.", "If you decline, and honestly I think you should based on how the request affected you, I think it would be fine to ask Sam\u2019s father to tell him that you\u2019ve moved on, found happiness with someone new, and wish him all the best and hope he gets better. (Maybe you don\u2019t wish him well, but since his dad is a nice man I think it would be kind to say.).", "I agree that leaving dad out of it is a kind thing, and you absolutely owe him nothing.\n\nI have an ex that stuff happened with that still makes me want to break out in hives/ I get lightheaded just thinking about it. He reached out a couple of years ago to say sorry and I was confused because I didn\u2019t have his number saved anymore (Just deleted him vs blocking). I asked who it was and never responded after he told me. Even if he was on his deathbed, I wouldn\u2019t owe him anything.  Why would I \u201cowe\u201d it to anyone to make them feel better about how they treated me? If they\u2019re really sorry they\u2019ll respect your needs and not expect you to retraumatize yourself to make them feel better. \n\nNTA, and if you at any point feel guilty about not taking time out of your life to make this trip and then recover from the aftermath, please be gentle to yourself and know that you don\u2019t owe him anything. Anyone who thinks otherwise can kick rocks.", "You owe nothing to him. If this interaction causes you distress, you\u2019re the one who will have live with it. Maybe that\u2019s crude, but it is what it is. Sam will die, and you owe him nothing. He can send healing energy out into the universe and know that he wanted to apologize for past actions, and accept that this is the way it ends, it\u2019s on himself to find healing, not you. It is selfish to impose an apology on someone in a way that will or might further harm them. The request was made, and you do not have to sacrifice your wellbeing. Take care. NTA.", "NTA, and the most he would get from me is a Zoom call. Why the hell would I spend a day of my life to go to someone's bedside like that when they rocked my world so badly?\n\nTo him, I bet a phone call isn't good enough since he can't see your facial expressions, so Zoom would be the most I'm willing to do. That way, you can have your partner off screen for support too.", "I never said she owed him, I just think that since OP is asking the question in the first place they will possibly feel guilty at some point in their life and a simple text to the dad could avoid that feeling.", "I agree.", "Hey now, THIS is the answer.", "Yes.  Keep it short and to the point with no further explanations and then to add you can make it clear that it is your final answer and to not contact you again."]}
