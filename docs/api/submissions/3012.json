I didn't understand why the other kids got to have Christmas and I didn't.\n\nI was also denied toys for the most part, and we never did fun family stuff together.

Keep it up!", "NTA. Sorry, OP, now you gotta double down, I don\u2019t make the rules. Spoil your wife!", "I wasn't allowed to play with Lego when I was a kid because 'it was for boys'.  Guess who has a ton of Lego and enjoys making stuff with her son?  It's awesome!  My parents roll their eyes at me, but eff them for trying to make me feel guilty for having fun.", "I\u2019m almost 50 and I collect stuffed animals. My most recent acquisition - a well known hedgehog and his partner \ud83d\ude0d my husband fully supports this, even though our apartment is teeny weeny and the stuff irs take up more room than we do aha \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nWhat you\u2019re doing is a great thing. Don\u2019t change to appease your in-laws. \nI detect no asshole here.", "Tons of folks older than you and your wife that enjoy the what her parents probably term as \"kids stuff\". I'd counter and say most anime is not for kids (I mean really not for kids). Tons of adults love Legos, heck there was a TV show with adults competing with Legos. Being Asian some parents raise their kids uber strict. I knew folks who in high school has only a few hours on Sunday for friends and usually it's \"selected\" friends. It's tutoring, music lessons, language lessons, tutoring for SATs, tutoring for tutoring, volunteering, etc. Some that I grew up with broke under this pressure. There was no time to be a kid and and toys were only educational. I was lucky my mom was never like that but I had to tell her to tell some of her acquaintances to back off their kids because I saw the breaks coming (as a kid I cannot possibly understand so it can't come from me \ud83d\ude44). Most of these parents grew up with a culture where you have to be a success so they spend so much time investing in their kids this way they forget they are just kids. I get your wife and thanks for opening up the world for her. NTA", "You are not the asshole", "YTA\n\nYou are enabling her. Its ok to let her enjoy life, but is she doing anything in return and treating you are an equal or are you just using her as a \"trophy\".", "THIS! OMG was thinking the exact same thing.", "Came to say similar I\u2019m 43 I collect pandas and squirrels, stuffies, pajamas, socks, pillows. You name it. \n\nOp is NTA. Just a good lovely caring hubby.", "My mother's in her 60s and still loves it when my dad wins stuffed prizes at the arcades or fairgrounds for her.\n\nOP is a good husband!", "I agree!! I had a horrible childhood growing up with lots and lots of trauma. \n\nI'm in an incredibly healthy relationship and I can finally do things fun cute silly childish things I never gotvto experience as a kid because I was in survival mode. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 has bought me so many build a bears. He takes me to arcades even though he doesn't love them the way I do. It's the best thing ever!\n\nOP NTA!", "Are you going to ask for Lego flowers for Christmas? Because you totally should. I\u2019m imagining the Lego sets being friends and that thought sparked so much joy. ^-^", "My husband got the succulent set for me too\n.. it's so cool.  The orchid is top-notch.", "There are so many bad husband stories on AITA but you are definitely not that.\n\nYou sound like an amazing husband, OP! Don't let her parents get into your head.\n\nNTA.", "Yes, congrats OP you are a very loving husband. But are you really contemplating changing because of her shitty parents,who bring her misery? Do you want to bring her misery?!", "Seriously, this man is giving love to both his wife and her inner child that didn\u2019t get to have fun. And his greatest joy genuinely seems to be making her happy.\n\nDammit, what a gem!", "I agree! This story was beautiful and I wish you and your wife a long lasting and loving life and marriage! \n\n\nAlso, you're not doing anything wrong, her parents need to be blocked, because they are the problem and they are the ones trying to manipulate her to do what they want.", "Truly!! Enjoy whatever you enjoy. OP sounds like a wonderful partner to his wife.", "Your friend is truly amazing. I am so happy you have such a great friend in your life!", "Your story made me so sad. I am sorry you had to go through that trauma as a child, but I am so happy that you have a friend who takes care of you!\n\n\nI hope the rest of your Christmas' are just as happy as the first one with your friend! \ud83d\udc9c", "Currently cuddling my squishmallows in bed while I read Reddit with legos on the shelves of my master bedroom. My husband isn\u2019t perfect, but he lets my inner kid be happy. \n\nNTA", "No. I think I just let them get in my head.  I always get her regular gifts too.  I just wasn't sure if maybe I should stop getting her toys.", "Right?  I'm looking at this thinking \"Where is \\*Her\\* agency here\"?  \n\n\nThe story is she \\*likes\\* these things, that's really the end of the story. There's nothing infantilizing about giving an adult toys if they enjoy them.  Infantilizing is denying someone's own decision making ability, which is exactly what they are doing to her by assuming somehow your job is to direct her attention like they did as a child.  \n\nThey are very much projecting.", "Speaking of up, has she ever climbed a tree? I think I know a fun family activity in the near future :D", "when's the last time you built a lego set\n\ni can change you", "Nice congrats on 49 years. One more year until the golden one. \u2764\ufe0f", "Magic the Gathering", "That was also my first thought!", "You got a brother or something? Lmao", "Lol literally what in the actual heck are you even saying, my dude? If by enabling, you mean encouraging her to enjoy herself & be unashamed to be honest about what she loves, then yeah. He\u2019s giving his partner gifts that she loves & has been denied most of her life. He is definitely NTA.", "She's in school.  What exactly is she supposed to be doing?", "Enabling her to do what? Have fun?", "I am 33. I work for attorneys. We have regular light sabre battles in the hallway.\n\nAlso, we have a 'team Panda', because they like pandas so much. Their office is amazing", "I'm 55 and I have a collection of stuffed sloths, including one that us 2 feet tall. I love when my husband goes to Wally World and plays the claw machines and brings me stuffed animals. I also have a lot of minion toys and baby yodas. \n\nOp you are a wonderful man who knows how to bring his wife joy, something her parents never did", "My husband\u2019s stocking last year was full of fidget toys and lightsaber chopsticks.  This year, it\u2019s new, different fidget toys, a neat hovering/flying ball, and Lego flowers.  He rarely buys these sorts of things for himself because he feels silly doing it, but he has used them all year (except the lightsaber chopsticks, but that was because they were too flexible to be good chopsticks, not because he didn\u2019t enjoy them).  He got more and more excited as he pulled out and tried each new toy, and I expect he\u2019ll do the same this year.  He knows I bought 2 of those balls for our nephews, and was enchanted when we tested them to make sure they worked, but he has no idea there\u2019s a third one in my closet, waiting to go in his stocking.\n\nThe best gifts are things the recipient will deeply enjoy but wouldn\u2019t buy for themself, for whatever reason.", "Absolutely not! We have a tradition at Christmas, that everyone gets one 'real' gift, and at least one 'joke' gift. Guess which ones bring the  most laughter and shared experience on Christmas Day?   \nI treasure my stupid anime fluffy slippers and socks with chickens on them. I treasure the Nessie soup ladle and the mug with a photo of my husband laughing like a maniac. \n\nNever stop doing the things that bring your wife JOY, you make her heart sing. Who cares if her parents disapprove? They can be killjoys and bland and boring and serious in their *own* house. They don't get to make the rules for yours.\n\nNTA", "Not at all. But feel free to send them random toys too for gifts :D Just because :D If they're going to insult you for making her happy, might as well have some fun with it."]}
