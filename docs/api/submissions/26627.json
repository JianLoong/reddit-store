Like, I'm trying to think what I would have said if I were in OPs shoes and everything I can think of is WAY harsher. If I try to come up with something less harsh, I only get generic insults like jerk that don't quite fit the nature of this argument.\n\nConsider that acts where people choose to be naked in close proximity to one another are generally considered sexual in nature, and that any form of unwanted touching can be considered assault. OP explicitly denied her consent for her husband wedging his sweaty naked ass into a confined space where she's also naked and trying to shower. Some couples like this sure, but no means no. This is just a step down from having sex with an unconsenting marriage partner, which I hope we all know is NOT okay just because you are married. I'm absolutely not saying this was an act of r\\*pe, but it's in the same camp. Another user said it well, not all nudity is all sexual, but all nudity requires consent.\n\nSo to me perv is really the only term that comes to mind which covers both \"You are an asshole and also invading my privacy in an unwanted manner\" without going straight into much more loaded language.", "\"perv\" is a normal reaction when someone 1. Doesn't ask for consent 2. When told no  still decides to overstep your boundaries.\n\nEven if it's someone you love and care about, indecent exposure is a crime in some places, on public or private settings. For example in Alaska indecent exposure in the second degree is \"(a) An offender commits the crime of indecent exposure in the second degree if the offender knowingly exposes the offender\u2019s genitals in the presence of another person with reckless disregard for the offensive, insulting, or frightening effect the act may have.\"\n\nIn this case OP husband disregarded OP feelings and comfort and choose to be offended after he was called on it. He is a perv, it's sad that a lot of people normalize this type of disrespect in their own relationships. It's okay to have a partner who you agreed beforehand that you both are comfortable being nude outside the bedroom, what is not is expect everyone to think the same way you do and crossing their boundaries when they say no.\n\nHe could have asked or he could have used the other bathroom, what he cannot do is    to overstep OP boundaries.
