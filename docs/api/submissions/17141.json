Remember it\u2019s war for parking and no prisoners are taken.", "NTA parking isn't assigned. Regardless of how he asked you're not obligated.", "NTA. He is basically trying to guilt everyone into guaranteeing he always has a spot. Your apartment complex sucks for not having enough off street parking.", "NTA, but he did ask nicely and getting along with neighbors is easier than fighting. Maybe ask your landlord to assign the spots, and he can have that spot for his unit, that way everybody gets an assigned spot.\n\nTo offer what could happen when things dont go well, I had a somewhat similar experience, different outcome. I lived in my 4-plex for 2 years and got a new neighbor. We do have 8 assigned parking spots, 2 tandem for each unit. He had a big truck. He asked if I could park on the street from now on so he could get out of his truck because the spots were too small. I said no, because I work random , sometimes long 16 hour shifts, so street parking isn't ideal esp since I already have assigned spot. He got MAD. Like really mad. And he would hit my car with his doors, block me in etc. He was a jerk about so many other things, but parking was his obsession. He then demanded I park in my other neighbors spot since she didnt always use her spot. He escalated to parking a second car behind me so I couldn't back out. I had to call the cops to get him to move. He then would wait for me to leave, then move his truck so he was parked in BOTH spots. I ended up installing a camera and documenting it, and reporting to my landlord, then he backed off, but he was still hostile and it made living there uncomfortable. He eventually moved. If I could go back I still would have held my ground, but I think I would have gotten the camera sooner. \nSo if your guy is being nice, and not demanding you park on the street, just not in that spot, I would just go along to get along, because the negative feelings and resentment that builds is not healthy.", "I recently got an expedition and I would probably prefer to park it in the street if parking is that tight. \n\nSometimes if you drive a big car you make sacrifices."]}
