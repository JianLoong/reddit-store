Well they broke up and she was heart broken, it was a very odd break up, but she realized later that she wasn\u2019t really in love with him but loved him as a person. She also realized though that he gaslit her a lot and started to separate her from her family and would get upset if she wanted to spend time with family over him. Well over the past 6 months she\u2019s been on dating apps while still \u201cstalking\u201d her ex (she would sometimes look at his instagram to see what he was up to, in the beginning it was frequent like 1-2 times a week and now it\u2019s like maybe once in 2 months). \n\n So now she\u2019s on dating apps and going on dates with guys weekly. I love my friend we have been best friends since 12 but she falls hard and fast for guys. Context: I am literally her only friend since she moved. (She\u2019s close with her younger sister too but I\u2019m her only friend). She will go on 2 or 3 dates with guy and then call me and be like \u201cshould I text him first since he didn\u2019t text me yesterday?\u201d Or \u201cwell he\u2019s being short with me should I not talk to him anymore\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019m over him he isn\u2019t really talking to me\u201d and then she tells me \u201cwell I really like this guy he seems so nice\u201d but complain to me about him (I get a call like this multiple times a week). She also struggles with mental health a lot to where she wouldn\u2019t be able to live alone. \n\nI tell my friend that she should stop talking to these guys and trying to get validation from them and going on those dating apps and focus on her mental health and being happy with her self. (When these guys either stop talking to her or put in little effort [I think it\u2019s cause all they wanted was sex] she gets really sad and it really messes with her mental health and self image) She tells me that she will delete the apps and stop talking to them but never does. Again we have this conversation weekly! I absolutely love my friend but I\u2019m tired of giving her the same advice week after week. I asked my sister and she said that I might be an ass cause I\u2019m her only friend and she feels comfortable enough to open up about what she\u2019s dealing with, but I\u2019m just tired of telling her to same thing.

And then change the subject, or end the convo if she won't.", "I get that must be incredibly irritating when its delivered like water torture. I don't really know if you would be an asshole for saying stop asking for advice. The thing is, one sentence can destroy a friendship, and not to be sexist but girls (at least in my experience) tend not to forgive as easily and will hold grudges for longer. So, this is possibly a destructive thing to say. \n\nMy advice in order to be NTA is to allow her to come to the realisation, have a serious discussion and subtly infer you don't want to hear other peoples problems because you have enough of your own - what ever it is just try and make her realise. Even if you said it straight up I don't think you'd be an asshole because if she is a good friend she will respect your boundaries.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
