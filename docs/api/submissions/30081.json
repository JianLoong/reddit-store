When S was required to get vaccinated as part of his job, he actually cried about it and thought about quitting- even though he purports to be a man\u2019s man that does what he has to do for his family.

These drugs, of course, were developed by the same evil, unscrupulous companies, and we do not know the long-term impact of ingesting these drugs for the purpose of weight loss.

Needless to say, my comments were not well received by G, S, or by her parents who were also present. Also, in their defense, G and S have a child that is autistic and they blame their child's autism on vaccines. \n\nFor the record, I am not against anyone making their own medical decisions.

Not just when it suits them and gets them out of something they don\u2019t want to do.  \n\nOne of my friends attends a Bible study group that had several members who couldn\u2019t possibly get vaccinated because fetal cell lines were used in testing.

Make THEM stop contacting you. haha\n\n\nPersonally, I agree. \n\nWe know the vaccines are safe. We know they are more tested than many vaccines have ever been, and they don't contain any mind-control chips or whatever conspiracy they're on about. \n\n\nYou're also correct that the GLP1 drugs are mostly safe, but we don't know the long-term effects, and there are some pretty severe known side-effects from them, etc. etc. \n\nYou're also correct that autism has nothing to do with vaccines. \n\n\nSo yeah, they're idiots, hypocrites, liars, peddlers of misinformation and best avoided.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s worse , Ozempic has some really bad side effects.

For the record I also refuse to trust the medical/pharmaceutical complex.\n\nHeres the thing.  When you point out the hypocrisy in others, you have to ask yourself what your motivation was.   If your goal was to help open their eyes and mind to the things in life they were blind too then NTA.  If you sank to their level and pointed out their hypocrisy because you saw that they were vulnerable and wished to rub it in, then yes, YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
