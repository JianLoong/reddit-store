Assuming neither is going to behave poorly, I don\u2019t see a problem with him having a guys night and her having a girls night.\n\nHis other behavior was incompatible with a trusting partner, which means they should break up.  Trust is essential.  Maybe I\u2019ve been married too long to know what the big deal about going to a club is.", "Absolutely.  My partner and I \"ask permission\" to do shit all the time, but the question isn't \"Can I go to this place without you throwing a tantrum?\" or \"Can I do laundry now without you demanding I stay next to you on the couch and tell you how you're the only man on the planet?\", it's \"Do you need me to do something else?\" or \"Do we have something else planned which I forgot?\"\n\nThat's not the situation here.  This girl asked him if she CAN go somewhere, and his response was, \"Well, since you're going somewhere, I'm going to go somewhere borderline inappropriate just to spite you since we can obviously just go anywhere we please!\". That's asking for permission from a controlling partner, not asking whether or not her presence is needed for something she overlooked", "True lol.. but in this case given how old they are etc, I get it", "The problem is it reads like retaliation. And that makes it seem like he doesn't want her to go to the NBA game. Instead of saying no, I don't want you to go the the NBA game, it's sure you CAN go, but if you do go I'm going to do this to spite you.", "I can see the retaliation.  I was more commenting on the idea that both should be allowed to do what they want.", "Yeah and I don't think anyone here would argue with you on that. I find the issue with this post being the retaliation I spoke on. Bare minimum in a relationship should be both sides being able to do what they want."]}
