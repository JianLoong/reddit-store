He is dumb, his daughter may as well learn now.", "Wow, your brother is unbelievably insecure. Forget not wanting to be wrong, he can't bear to look like there's something he doesn't know? That is *not* a good quality in a parent (or in anyone!!).\n\nKids - and people in general - do not respect that kind of thing. They don't respect someone who can't admit they don't know something, or can't admit they're wrong. I've done a lot of teaching and I saw that all the time - and it's only a matter of time before she figures out her dad can't say \"I don't know,\" and that's NOT going to make her think he knows everything. \n\nHe needs to recognize that if he wants his daughter's respect, his best bet is to honest about the limits of his knowledge, and then support her in finding the answers he doesn't have. \n\nSo many people make the mistake of thinking that the worst thing for a teacher to say is \"I don't know.\" But that's complete BS! Past a certain age (and niece is at that age), no one expects that one person is going to know everything! \n\nThe way to gain respect is NOT to pretend you know everything. Sooner or later, you're going to make a mistake, and your inability to admit that, or to admit any lack of knowledge, is going to seem like the massive weakness it is. \n\nLearners actually *respect* people who are willing to admit when there's something they don't know. \n\nFor example, my dad knows a lot, but even as a kid I knew he didn't know everything, *because he told me so.* If I asked him a question he couldn't answer, he would say he didn't know, but he would follow it up with ideas and suggestions for how we might figure it out together. Sometimes that just meant finding a person who knew the right answer, but sometimes it might mean doing our own research or little experiments. Sometimes it meant recognizing that no one knew the answer, and that was fascinating in its own right.\n\nI learned as much from my dad figuring out things he didn't know as I did from him telling me the things he did know. Over time, the ability to look at a question I couldn't answer and come up with ideas for how to answer it was *much* more important than whatever information my dad imparted.\n\nOh, and to this day (I'm in my 50s) I think my dad is one of the smartest people I've ever known. \n\nSo if your brother wants his kid to think he's smart, he's going about it in exactly the wrong way. She probably already knows that he doesn't have all the world's knowledge in his head; if she doesn't know that yet, she will soon. And once she figures that out, him pretending to know is only going to make her distrust his answers, and respect him less. \n\nHe needs to learn how to say I don't know, and he needs to learn that not knowing is not a bad thing. It's going to make him a better teacher and a better parent.\n\nOh, and obviously NTA.", "No. You were educating your niece. If your brother feels stupid, that's on him", "NTA \n\nYour brother seems to have a big fragile ego. You only stated a fact to your niece and didn\u2019t insult your brother in the process.

What a fragile ego, one that is shattered by oatmeal raisin cookies.", "NTA a simple no without an explanation means nothing to a kid or to anyone for that matter. The explanation that sugar is really bad for a dog is something the kid will remember and can actually associate in the future.", "NTA - it was a teaching moment.
