He is dumb, his daughter may as well learn now.", "Wow, your brother is unbelievably insecure. Forget not wanting to be wrong, he can't bear to look like there's something he doesn't know? That is *not* a good quality in a parent (or in anyone!!).\n\nKids - and people in general - do not respect that kind of thing. They don't respect someone who can't admit they don't know something, or can't admit they're wrong. I've done a lot of teaching and I saw that all the time - and it's only a matter of time before she figures out her dad can't say \"I don't know,\" and that's NOT going to make her think he knows everything. \n\nHe needs to recognize that if he wants his daughter's respect, his best bet is to honest about the limits of his knowledge, and then support her in finding the answers he doesn't have. \n\nSo many people make the mistake of thinking that the worst thing for a teacher to say is \"I don't know.\" But that's complete BS! Past a certain age (and niece is at that age), no one expects that one person is going to know everything! \n\nThe way to gain respect is NOT to pretend you know everything. Sooner or later, you're going to make a mistake, and your inability to admit that, or to admit any lack of knowledge, is going to seem like the massive weakness it is. \n\nLearners actually *respect* people who are willing to admit when there's something they don't know. \n\nFor example, my dad knows a lot, but even as a kid I knew he didn't know everything, *because he told me so.* If I asked him a question he couldn't answer, he would say he didn't know, but he would follow it up with ideas and suggestions for how we might figure it out together. Sometimes that just meant finding a person who knew the right answer, but sometimes it might mean doing our own research or little experiments. Sometimes it meant recognizing that no one knew the answer, and that was fascinating in its own right.\n\nI learned as much from my dad figuring out things he didn't know as I did from him telling me the things he did know. Over time, the ability to look at a question I couldn't answer and come up with ideas for how to answer it was *much* more important than whatever information my dad imparted.\n\nOh, and to this day (I'm in my 50s) I think my dad is one of the smartest people I've ever known. \n\nSo if your brother wants his kid to think he's smart, he's going about it in exactly the wrong way. She probably already knows that he doesn't have all the world's knowledge in his head; if she doesn't know that yet, she will soon. And once she figures that out, him pretending to know is only going to make her distrust his answers, and respect him less. \n\nHe needs to learn how to say I don't know, and he needs to learn that not knowing is not a bad thing. It's going to make him a better teacher and a better parent.\n\nOh, and obviously NTA.", "No. You were educating your niece. If your brother feels stupid, that's on him", "NTA \n\nYour brother seems to have a big fragile ego. You only stated a fact to your niece and didn\u2019t insult your brother in the process.

What a fragile ego, one that is shattered by oatmeal raisin cookies.", "NTA a simple no without an explanation means nothing to a kid or to anyone for that matter.

You're NTA for the situation you asked about, but also I'm genuinely curious why this would matter?", "NTA. Bro made hiself look stupid, not you. Maybe go into more graphic detail with the raisins and grapes next time. One of the guys from Ben & Jerry's liked the sister of the other guy. Back in the 1960s or 70s he heard that you can't make grape ice cream because an enzyme or something in grapes prevents the cream mixture from freezing. He experimented until he actually made grape ice cream that was properly frozen. He rushed over to the other guy's folks house where the sister lived and casually fed a bite to the dog. It literally dropped dead because grapes are so toxic to dogs. Raisins are worse because when you dry the fruit out you concentrate all of the nutrients, enzymes, etc, making them far more potent.", "NTA - you only look stupid in front of your kid if you are unwilling to learn something new. \n\nMy kids LOVE watching me learn new things, especially if they get to teach them to me.\n\nI think a big reason so many younger-than-boomer adults are so lost right now, is because our parents let us believe there was a point at which we WOULD know everything and have it figured out, and that was a total lie.", "NTA. Good dog owner and good Uncle using an opportunity to educate both niece and brother... \n\nYour brother may have self esteem issues if he has thrown a tantrum over this.\nMaybe it's a sign of other issues in his life and could benefit from a brother chat...
