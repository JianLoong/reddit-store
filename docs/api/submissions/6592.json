He's half Great Dane and half some dog my friend's dog met during an unauthorized absence. My son loves this dog and does all the care for him (except vet stuff) and is a very responsible dog owner. This dog is pretty much his best friend.\n\nMy wife is 12 weeks pregnant, and ever since we confirmed the pregnancy she has been acting weird around the dog. She avoids him, puts her hands over her stomach when he is around and jolts whenever he makes noise. Today she told me she wants to re-home the dog. I asked her what she was talking about.\n\nShe said she has been having anxiety that he will jump on her. This is completely unreasonable. He doesn't jump on people. We trained him not to jump on people or run into people very young because he is half Great Dane and I felt this was important for all dogs, but especially one who could possibly grow to such a large size (which he did). There is no reason for her to think the dog will jump on her.\n\nShe said that there is no way to know for sure that the dog won't jump on her, and if he does our baby could be hurt. This dog has never so much as growled at her. She said even if the dog doesn't jump on her, her anxiety about it is bad for her health. She said she needs the dog elsewhere for her safety and the baby's.\n\nI told her that there was no way. My son got this dog right after he lost his mom and imprinted on him hard. Sometimes I think he loves the dog more than me! I'm not taking his dog. The dog didn't do anything!\n\nMy wife said I am prioritizing the dog over her pregnancy. The dog isn't a threat to her pregnancy. If this were any other unreasonable request, I would just do it because she is pregnant. I just can't break my son's heart over a fear she has that makes no sense.

That being said talk to her about talking to her Dr and a therapist. Good luck", "NTA and while your wife is correct on not knowing for sure that a dog may or may not jump(even with proper training it can happen) she is just overthinking things.

A new baby is a busy time, as you probably know.", "NTA. Do not take the dog away. If your wife really has anxiety about this, she needs therapy.

They knew something was up and were even more protective of my ex at the time -- they knew somehow that she was pregnant. They stayed out of her lap. They guarded her. When my daughter was born, they were dedicated protectors. One was always close to the bassinet. The other was the scout, investigating any sound, prepared to protect that child. They were the same way when my son was born.\n\nFast forward many years. I'm divorced. Our beautiful, wonderful dogs have long passed. My disabled adult son still lives with me.

Separating them would be a disaster for both of them.\n\nYou *can't* give that dog away. Your son *needs* him (and vice versa). Unless your wife has some hostile relationship with the dog, this seems like a very natural, very understandable, very strong, but possibly irrational reaction, to fears about this pregnancy.

All of these factors generate powerful feelings that can't be denied.\n\nIf you give that dog away, your son will (rightly) resent you, your wife, and the new child. \n\nThis is going to be messy, but you are NTA for standing up for your son and his dog.

Your hormones are doing super weird things to your body and your brain when you\u2019re pregnant, and sometimes this becomes more than just general concern. Your wife should think about speaking to someone about this. In the mean time, is there a way you can support her without having to rehome the dog, like keeping him restrained when he\u2019s around her, or making sure she always has people between herself and the dog?", "NTA. But keep an eyeball on the dog. She sounds a bit unhinged.", "Definitely NTA!  \nI understand that she's anxious and all of that, but this dog is important to your son - and by the sounds of it, was there before she was. \n\nIf the dog is causing her that much anxiety, that is something she will need to address herself, it is definitely not reasonable to ask you (and your son) to re-home the dog.", "NTA\n\nNot wanting to be the one who walks the dog is one thing.\n\nWanting to get rid of her stepchild\u2019s beloved dog because she\u2019s pregnant is ridiculous.\n\nIf it helps tell her I not only cared for a 90 pound dog while pregnant, I *ran* her for a good portion", "Noooo please don't rehome the doggy ignore her NTA", "NTA - there really is no rational risk here, especially if she is not even caring for the dog or interacting with it. \n\nI can see two different reasons behind this - the first is prenatal anxiety, which can be very real, and very debilitating. This will be hard to broach, because sometimes it can feel like somebody is calling you irrational, which doesn't help the situation (even when you kind of are being irrational - it feels real. Pregnancy can make you feel incredibly powerless!)\n\nThe second less likely but far more craven possibility is that she's asking you to do this as some kind of twisted way of establishing dominance for your new child over your son, or testing your loyalty to the new baby over your son - e.g. get rid of your son's dog for the safety of our new shared child - are you going to prioritise the baby etc.", "NTA - you are prioritizing your son, not the dog. But your wife should speak to her doctor about her anxiety. Some women do experience anxiety and depression during pregnancy and that should be addressed. It will be something they follow throughout her pregnancy and well as postpartum.", "NTA. If the dog has actually done something to give her a valid reason for concern then you should rehome the dog, but since he\u2019s never jumped on anyone or even growled at her I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a reason to worry.", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t let this be another post where someone pregnant acts unreasonable towards a pet - (family member) and forces you to get rid of him. \n\nThe animal has done nothing wrong. In fact, it seems this is all based on a *perceived* possible thing that *could possibly* happen. This is no reason to dump your dog.", "NTA. Make sure the dog is microchipped and geotagged. Her anxiety is real but not rational. And irrational people can do crazy things.", "NTA but she\u2019s definitely trying to manipulate you concerning your son\u2019s dog. Sit her down and have a long talk about why the dog is.Important to your son. During this talk, let her know you care but that she needs help with her pregnancy anxiety. And insist on the therapy because I suspect she will just keep fixating on unreasonable fears related to the pregnancy and her desire to protect her baby (that part is reasonable). But absolutely stand firm on not giving up the dog. There\u2019s more to her wanting to rehome the dog than she is saying!", "\"My son got this dog right after he lost his mom and imprinted on him hard.\"\n\nAaaaand there it is. She's using the pregnancy as leverage to pit herself against your son and prove you love her the most. Which is immature, gross, and probably something she's been quietly insecure about for a long time.\n\nI'm sure getting pregnant made her think about her place in your family, what her child's place will be, how the siblings are going to get along etc. But she has no right to take out her insecurities on your son. If she's that anxious, tell her to get therapy. I have clinical anxiety so I made sure I had extra support during and after my pregnancy.  My daughter is a happy, well adjusted three year old.\n\nNTA.", "NTA I knew before I got to the end of your \npost your wife was a stepmom and not a mother to your son. \n\nI predict your wife will become more ludicrous once she has her own child and try to alienate and push your son and his wants and needs out of the picture. Keep standing up for your son\u2019s needs.", "YTA but not for the reasons you think.\n\nI see a few scenarios here:\n\n1.The dog is actually dangerous and you are underestimating the danger because you don't want to deal with it.\n\n2. Your wife is having an extreme irrational fear while undergoing pregnancy which could be a sign of severe mental issues that could arise and you HAVEN'T TAKEN HER TO A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL WHEN YOU SHOULD.\n\n3. Your wife is a master manipulator who waited until she got pregnant to get rid of your child's dog, in which case you are an asshole for bringing her into your child's life.\n\nIt seems to me that you are not taking this situation seriously enough. If the danger feels real to her then something needs to be done about it and there are many other options that aren't re housing the dog. Explore some of those.", "Tell her she can find somewhere else to be because the dog was here first. #FOH", "NTA - ask her: tell me you hate dogs without telling me you hate dogs. She\u2019s using it as an excuse. DO NOT TAKE THAT DOG AWAY. When I was a kid our dog had pups. We kept one and she was my brothers dog. My parent split when that dog was young. She was a bit goofy due to poor training but my dad at some point paid the neighbor to take her behind his back and have her put down. And that destroyed my brother. He doesn\u2019t know she died like that - just that my dad gave her away. That neighbor told me years later and I never told him because that poor kid also is the one who found our mom dead. Sorry but your wife is a witch.", "NTA. She sounds like she is just trying to get rid of the dog in hopes everyone will focus their attention on her new puppy\u2026 I mean, child. Her anxiety can be managed. Talk about it with her doctor at the next appointment and see if he or she can offer any suggestions to ease her mind.", "NTA. You're prioritizing your son over her ridiculousness.", "I'm not sure my assessment would be as aggressive as this. Your wife is clearly concerned after the well being of her unborn child. I'd be worried if she wasn't. \n\nI don't see her as Lady MacBething your dog. But I do think it's important you find a compromise that includes keeping the dog. Your 14 year old son will already be experiencing a lot of emotions about having a new born added to the family. I imagine it would be quite traumatic to have the dog he loved removed from his family.", "Definitely feels like the last part.. for sure. I\u2019m currently pregnant, and have a goldendoodle who HAS jumped on me and pushed against my belly. What did I learn? To work on training and to protect my belly when I get home. Never did I think about rehoming him. But that\u2019s also because I love my dog and would not even consider. Yes I get some anxiety about how my dogs will behave around the baby, but again this is where I\u2019m taking steps to prepare my dogs for the baby. Definitely think your wife just doesn\u2019t like the dog and is using her pregnancy as an excuse. Sorry \ud83d\ude22", "I\u2019d also slip an AirTag onto his collar. Microchips are good but they rely on someone else finding the dog and deciding to have it scanned. An AirTag is a geolocation thing.\n\nEdit: yes everyone I KNOW an AirTag can be removed and that they\u2019re bulky. I said ALSO for a reason. \n\nThere\u2019s a chance it might go unnoticed AND if it doesn\u2019t you might be able to trace the collar back to the wife", "Piggybacking on this \u261d\ufe0fcomment above.  Maybe, just in case of a worst case scenario you might want to consider familiarizing yourself with the animal shelters in your area and surrounding areas.  And take lots of pictures of the dog.  Get a GPS dog collar w/ smartphone app.  And make sure your partner knows that you're keeping the dog over her if you have to choose.", "The son will likely resent his new sibling too which isn't fair to either kid.", "I was thinking this as well. Getting rid of the dog permanently seems pretty unreasonable, but I could see having a friend or family member keep the dog for a short time, or limiting where the dog can go in the house so she has places she can go away from the dog if she's concerned. My only concern would be that after the baby is born she would still be just as nervous about the dog being around the infant and want to make any temporary changes more permanent.", "Yes. It sounds like she has postpartum anxiety or OCD (which can happen before giving birth). It\u2019s scary and not fun. She might genuinely think the dog is a danger because her hormones aren\u2019t allowing her to think rationally. Help her get help, OP!", "Agreed. NAH - the dog should stay and she needs help from her doctor. When I was pregnant I would get fixated on certain things and worry. Laying on my belly in the first trimester was a big one for me. I know logically it was fine but I was terrified that I would squish my baby. Of course that didn\u2019t happen and my doctor helped alleviate my anxiety. I have anxiety meds I take but having her answer my questions in depth was a big comfort.", "Good points. A colleague's daughter works in a gym (she's a trainer). When she was pregnant with her 1st baby, she had \\*massive\\* anxiety about getting some horrible contagion from the equipment that would imperil her pregnancy. Her husband was a shit about it at first until his wife burst into tears and listed all the horrible things that could happen during pregnancy (partially because my colleague urged her daughter to explain her anxieties). She (the pregnant woman) ended up on a safe-during-pregnancy Rx that drastically eased her worries during the pregnancy. She still works at the gym and has 2 healthy kids (and a bunch of dogs that never caused worries...)", "His relationship with his son is important.", "OP - it\u2019s possible that pregnancy is bringing out anxiety she didn\u2019t realize was present. Id recommend gently talking to her about discussing anxiety treatment options with her OB provider. There are many safe options out there.", "I disagree with the original commenter. I would encourage your wife to discuss this with her OB. One of the big symptoms of my antepartum anxiety (which carried into postpartum) was how I reacted to our dog. It also bled to our dogs personality while I was pregnant (she\u2019s a bully, and she would anxiously pace and/or follow me around way more closely and generally acted out - ie she is housebroken but would go the bathroom without queuing she needed to go out or would shred our older kids toys). \n\nSome counseling might help your wife. The first trimester is also brutal. It tended to level out for me in my second trimester and then ramp back up as i neared delivery.", "Also, the baby is extremely well protected inside her womb. There's a lot between the dog and the baby, especially in the first and second trimesters.", "And that is your sons dog he loves and is attached to after his mothers death? Do NOT give in to your wife please. It would be cruel to your son. Your wife needs to get over it.", "Postpartum anxiety can also be prepartum anxiety. There is treatment available if this is what\u2019s going on with her, and getting rid of the dog won\u2019t fix the anxiety if that\u2019s the underlying cause of all this - she would just be anxious about something else. She needs to talk to her doctor about this.", "I understand her reason why she wants to get rid of the dog. Now you also have to understand she is pregnant and our hormones going crazy while pregnant so this could be the hormones.", "Yeah. She\u2019s manipulating you.

Honestly I'm am utterly disgusted when people dump their pets like an inconvenient toy of no use because of mini version of themselves is more entertaining.  I would end friendships over it.\n\n  \nAnd that's without going into the trauma it will cause your son.  I still get sad 30 years later when I think about my dad putting down our dog because he claimed the dog had growled at my baby brother (she never growled at anyone) just because he was fed up having the dog around.\n\n  \nYou are a good person for not considering it.", "You not only trained a dog to behave properly but also raised an 8 yo to be a responsible dog owner! That's like a minor miracle to me! I'd trust you with pretty much anything just hearing those two things.\n\nIt really honestly sounds like a manipulation tactic and your son will recognize it as such and seriously turn against both her, you and the kid if she gets away with this. This isn't really a choice between her and the dog, it's a choice between her and your 14 yo kid. \n\nIf her anxiety is that bad, she needs therapy stat.

In late 2020-early 2021 with my daughter I was taking Wellbutrin and Prozac.  I also stayed on my meds while pumping milk for both kids.  Both kids were born healthy, at term, with no issues.  \n\nI've taken these kinds of meds since I was in high school and am now in my late 30s.  Therapy off and on occasionally helped.  We do have a family history of mental illness so I was very conscious of what I was putting into my body.\n\nI chose to stay on meds while pregnant because of my long history with depression and anxiety.

NTA", "So an interesting thing about medications with suicidal ideation as a side effect (namely anxiety or depression meds) is that the ideation generally exists within a person before the medications, even in a small way.\n\nWith anti depressants - theyre made to remove the chemical imbalance causing depression. Suicidal ideation, or even passive Suicidal ideation (i.e. 'im not gonna do it myself but idc if it happens') is a different thing from depression. Removing the depression removes the lack of motivation, leading to more thoughts or even planning. In some unfortunate cases, even action.\n\nWith anxiety meds - it removes the anxiety surrounding the act or the thought of committing the act, leading to the same as before. More planning, free range thoughts, or even committing. \n\nSo, TL;DR, anxiety and antidepressants *should* be okay for OPs wife (and anyone else for that matter) to take without ideation becoming a real concern unless theres been thoughts of that beforehand.\n\nAs far as the nausea and anxiety, a big thing to remember for side effects is that just because its *listed* doesnt mean it's *true* or going to happen.

My birth control has a side effect of dark spots appearing on the face/arms (patch).

Step two, I believe is therapy for your family, perhaps a combination of joint and individual sessions. Your wife needs therapy for her pregnancy as well as to identify, whatever is causing fear of the dog. This isn't for you to figure out, but for the therapist to assist her with. Secondly, individual sessions for your son, as this dog is very important to him and came into his life at an important time; not giving him an opportunity to address this with a therapist could result in resentment between him and your wife/his stepmom.

Don't make her feel like she is crazy, or necessarily wrong about wanting to make sure your unborn child is safe. As there is no immediate threat, there is no reason to go to that drastic length at this point. Go to counseling with her, it would probably be good to do a few sessions together too.

A lot of women go through it it\u2019s under studied but it does exist. Some people actually experienced this very early in the pregnancy before they even started showing other symptoms of pregnancy.", "It's completely normal for pregnant women to turn on animals in the house (or even their husbands or other children).

The doctor is a neutral third party with nothing but mother and baby\u2019s best interests in mind. Hopefully they could reassure the wife and give some guidance about the anxiety.

OP, be as kind as possible even if she\u2019s being unreasonable because it\u2019s hard to explain how much pregnancy hormones affect your ability to regulate your emotions. She\u2019s probably anxious about many things she can\u2019t control and has therefore latched on to this one source of anxiety that she thinks she can. Also, this is a pretty common thing for some pregnant women. It might be good to discuss all the precautions you will take to keep baby safe even though you have total faith in your dog (ex: never leave baby and dog unattended together, keep baby far away from anything dog is protective over, make sure dog is able to get away from baby once baby is crawling, teach dog from an early age to only sniff baby\u2019s feet and not head, etc)", "They were still kittens and found a good home.

It\u2019s bizarre what can happen in your brain during pregnancy, as I am a HUGE animal person and have always looked to those relationships for support and strength in my life. \n\nIf I would have known it was something going on with me that would likely subside after pregnancy or could be worked through then I wouldn\u2019t have made that choice.

Depression in pregnancy carried a much higher risk.", "I think it's really positive for your daughter that you've recognised the impact of the decision and the reasons behind it. From a practical perspective though, kittens are very high maintenance and could have been challenging in a household with a toddler and a new baby but that doesn't change how the situation affected your daughter and the sibling relationship. But for anyone thinking of adding a pet/pets to a household with infants and toddlers, adult pets who a shelter knows is chilled out and low maintenance is probably a better idea than kittens or puppies - might be difficult to negotiate with a toddler set on kittens though!", "I think that this is really a decision between a woman and her doctor and there are probably a lot of variables making everyone\u2019s situation a little different.

New neighbours used to call to warn about \u201cthe big bear\u201d seen around our place, but he was the sweetest dog ever. When I was a few months old, my aunt came to visit my parents with my baby cousin. Both of us were put in our stroller outside with a baby monitor for nap time. That dog stayed outside with us to watch over and wouldn\u2019t let my aunt take my cousin when he started crying, as he didn\u2019t know her well. Wasn\u2019t agressive or anything, he just kept putting himself between her and the stroller. My bro had to come move him so my aunt could finally take her own son.", "NTA, you and your son trained your dog well. With no history of any aggression or over excitement towards her there's no reason to re-home the dog. Be on the lookout of her enticing the dog to react. She may try to force a reaction to make an excuse to re-home the dog. \n\nPS. Any tips for training a dog not to jump? I've been turning my back to my pup when he jumps and telling him down when he attempts to jump on guests and asking them not to pet him until he goes down. Beyond that, is it just consistency?", "This is why I will never understand people who listen to random redditors. There\u2019s more reasons than just \u201cshe\u2019s traumatized or she\u2019s manipulating you\u201d. To say that so absolutely is silly to me.

We would also give my son's friends treats and have them do the same. Then when it became a habit for him, we would give him a treat for doing it without a command. So now it's just ingrained behavior for him not to jump on someone when they come in a room. The key is not to react to the jumping, but to prevent it altogether, basically. Train him to sit when people enter a room instead of training him not to jump. Easier to train a dog to do something than not to do something, if that makes sense.", "I first read about that a few weeks ago on this sub - and found that informative super interesting.  When I got pregnant my previously super chill dog developed bad anxiety- we think she could smell I was pregnant and it upset her?  Her anxiety was so bad she kept me up at night and I ended up getting anxiety back at her and resented her pretty badly until the end of my pregnancy.  It was so weird because I adored her before that, and recently I've wondered if it wasn't just pregnancy brain telling me she was bad for the baby (because she wouldn't let me sleep).  \n\nI also had crazy strong nesting instincts - so I believe it when someone tells you pregnancy can take over your brain.  Your instincts are so much stronger when pregnant and us humans really aren't used to instincts overruling higher brain functions.", "I agree with this. I had to kick my dog out of my bed (and into her own right next to my bed) when I was pregnant.

One of the reasons I wasn't keen on having kids (aside from a complete lack of desire to have them) was that I take a whole cocktail of medication for depression and ADHD.

Referring to her as \"that woman\" when it's OP's wife, making up a story that her pregnancy is an excuse to manipulate him because she's jealous of the dog (?!), thinking she's a \"hysterical woman\" about to kill the dog (??!),.... talk about paranoia. The kid shouldn't have to lose his dog, but she is also experiencing real anxiety about having a large animal with a small baby. They should talk to her doctor and not reddit.", "Agree.

If she's never had a problem with the dog before, and pregnancy is the only new factor, that's probably the cause.\n\nu/TheGreatestGreatDane One thing that may help is to involve her in training the dog in preparation for a baby in the house (e.g. [tips](https://yourdogsfriend.org/life-with-dogs/preparing-your-dog-for-a-new-baby/)).
