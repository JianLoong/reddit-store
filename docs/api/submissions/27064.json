He was everything to me. Words cannot describe how much I loved him. We are Asians, and love marriages are not that common in my country, but we were determined to make it possible or so I thought. It was a really toxic affair because he used to make me do all his work and fulfill all his needs; basically, I was performing all the wifely duties without being an actual wife. He dumped me three years ago because his parents found a potential bride for him and he could not let them down. I was shaken.\n\nHe was from a rich family, and I come from a humble background, but I never ever took a single penny from him or asked for any expensive shit. Once, during our final year of college, we both needed better laptops due to assignments and projects, but my parents weren't able to afford them at that time, but his father gifted him a more expensive one. I was upset, and let me be very clear: I was not jealous of him; I was just upset that we couldn't do anything about my laptop, but instead of supporting me, he said, \"Girls are liabilities, boys are assets, and of course your parents won't invest in a liability.\" We had a huge argument after this because I am a single child and I know my parents love me.\n\nFast forward to now. He is divorced and has a 1-year-old daughter with his now-ex-wife. I, on the other hand, am thriving in my career and have no plans on getting married. After 3 months of him begging me, my friends, and coming to my city, I agreed to meet him. He was hoping to reconcile, but I flat out told him to just leave me, and anyway, he has a \"liability\" to take care of now, in a sarcastic way. He got confused, so I reminded him about that incident. He got upset is an understatement, and he cursed me out in public. I got scared and left without even arguing. I have nothing against his child, but I think I did something absolutely wrong. It was not intended and happened in the heat of the moment.\n\n\nUpdate: A common friend of ours called me and told me that he is so depressed that he's thinking about taking his own life. I handed him the number of the police and welfare department and said if anything related to him even comes again from you or anyone else, I will forward this to his family so they can deal with his crap and his ex-wife so she can deal with the custody of the baby.", "created_utc": 1694974464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16l7txo/aita_for_sarcastically_referring_to_my_exs_child/", "score": 1791, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He wanted to get back together with OP (without apologizing), and probably wanted her to fill in the mother figure for the child.", "No one is in favor of calling a child a \"liability\". What OP did was show her ex how wrong he was in the past by throwing his words back at him. **HE** said OP was a \"liability\" to her parents because she was a girl, and that since he was a boy, he was an \"asset\". \n\nIs it petty? Of course it is, no disagreement to that. But she didn't say that to hurt the child or out of malice for the child, but rather to cruelly remind her ex of all the horrible things he did and believed. \n\nWould it have been more classy if she had said \"Turns out I'm the asset and you're the liability\" to achieve the same effect? Sure. But why should OP act in her good graces when he was the one who reached out to her in hopes of her getting back with him and assume her wifely duties again?", "I did get a few marriage proposals but I keep rejecting them. For now my work life is awesome and I enjoy every bit of it. My ex once told me \"I will never be able to hold a job and this is just his general observation about me\".\n\nEvery time I get praised by someone for my work I feel validated and content. I am working on myself more than ever.", "Or he\u2019s just upset he can\u2019t convince her to get back together and take on parenting responsibilities for when his daughter is with him.", "Or ... after his divorce he was expecting OP to step right back into the 'wifely duties' including caring for his child. And using his own logic as a reason to turn him down enraged him because 1.) she was supposed to be the same docile, accommodating girl he dated in college and now realized that she had grown a spine (partly due to the way he mistreated her), and 2.) how could she be a proper caretaker if she talked about his daughter that way?!", "No it\u2019s bc he wants her to come back and do the wifely duties he took for granted", "Because she doesn't actually mean it, and he knows that. Talk about didn't get the joke. Plus, he was clearly abusive when they were together, and OP flat out said she has nothing against his daughter. She said it as a way to clap back at him and force him to face his own misogyny.", "You're likely right. I think he was only nice to her in the same way he'd be nice to his microwave.", "Don't answer unknown numbers. Don't open unknown emails.\n\nConsider changing your phone number.\n\nCan you report him for harassment or unsocial behavior or whatever it's called in your country?", "I'm so sorry this is happening. I think the best way to handle this is to never respond, save all his messages in case you need evidence for a restraining order, and keep blocking the numbers and emails.\n\nI think in some places in the US (I'm not American) you can contact police non emergency line and tell them you are targeted by a stalker. This way they might come sooner if you need to call them.", "Now aren't you glad that he didn't marry you back then? Otherwise you will be the single mum now with an abusive ex-husband to deal with? \n\nHe did you a favour. Block him forever and live your best life. As Ajahn Brahm related, \"Good or bad, who knows?\" In your case it was definitely a silver lining!", "Rightfully so as he sounds dangerous - and the whole \"he's thinking about taking his own life\" sounds like a tactic to try and control your more than anything. I would consider contacting police and getting a protection order - it won't necessarily stop him but it introduces consequences that'll make him think twice.", "Can you get a restraining order?", "With all due respect you might want to well \u2026 lie. \u201cMom and dad I had a friend in college but he\u2019s really changed. His wife left him bc he has anger issues and is a manipulative liar - he\u2019s looking for a replacement mom for his kid and got mad when I told him no! He\u2019s completely fabricated our history and is crazy enough to think I had a thing for him back then!!\u201d\n\nBasically say whatever it is you need to say to get ahead of the story and make him look unhinged and crazy and like he\u2019s not above photoshopping pictures of you guys together to try to destroy your life.", "Definitely change your number and other contact information, contact the police, and get ahead of this with your parents. This is a time where you are going to have to fib a bit to them. Say that you were close friends in school but he became obsessed with wanting to become more, and was very toxic like tearing up your assignments and other things to try and make you fail at school because you wouldn't date him. You thought it was all taken care of when his family found him a wife. But now they are divorced because he was heavily abusive towards her (I know you don't know this for sure, but in what other instances in your culture would her family allow her to divorce him so fast??), and now he is stocking and harassing you again, and making up all these lies about your relationship before, trying to force you to have a relationship with him now which would include taking care of this child he had with his ex-wife. That doesn't have to be EXACTLY what yoy say, but you get the idea. You just absolutely want to cover all your bases so there is absolutely no way he can manipulate the situation.", "Yes, it is very interesting that many people look down on American culture without considering their own.", "And insulted an innocent child in the process", "Do not ever jump into marriage too quick. It's good on you to focus on you and your career. You dodged a bullet with this guy.", "Maybe his parents can find him another bride. /s", "This is more like it.", "He's controlling and abusive. Why would you want to go back and be treated like the nanny? NTA. Good for you throwing his own prejudice back in his face.", "It's not a joke. OP directed her anger at him into the misogynistic dig at a baby girl. This is what perpetuates this kind of culture. I'm Asian. Older Asian women put younger women down a lot instead of directing their anger at the men in their life. They had to take shit so why shouldn't the younger generation, is the thinking. \n\nWhat OP did was shitty. She should be asking why of all the things she could have said about his shitty behavior, she chose to go for that?", "I hate my old microwave and I'm still nicer to it than that.", "I might have to if he does something near my workplace. But letting him cool down is a better option.\n\nI once argued back a lot to him in college and he tore my assignments and made me rewrite them in one day.", "The amount of countries where the police will actually do anything real to help us pretty slim.", "Okay, you can stop white knighting for America now. This is getting cringey.", "Tbqh, it isn't really Americans \"culture\" everyone looks down on. It's the other stuff.", "Comprehension skills aren't your best, hey?", "That clearly takes some time, he needs someone to take the responsibilities in the meantime. /s", "You do realize that his family finding a bride for him was the best thing that could have happened to you? You were so in love with him that he got away with treating you like shit.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if he's divorced so quickly because his new wife had enough self-respect to not put up with being treated like that. So he comes back to you because he figures that things will be the same as they were before and he can abuse you and demean you and you'll still think he's wonderful and hung the moon like you did before.\n\nThat you fear his violent / destructive reaction is all the more reason to call the police. At least it would be in this country where a police report would be a step toward getting a restraining order against him.\n\nI cannot emphasize enough to never have anything more to do with this man. And to get rid of any friends who try to mediate for him.", "What a jerk. Avoid all contact and get in touch with the police if necessary.", "That's pretty much textbook academic abuse \u2013 taking out his anger and 'punishing' you by directly attacking your ability to perform well in school. Refusing to honor your desire not to be in contact with him is also wildly unacceptable. NTA, you owe an abuser nothing. Just please do what you need to do to protect yourself.", "You can still ask the police department to open a file. Calling you for others numbers after you've blocked him is considered harassment in a lot of places. The police might not take it seriously but having a record of it can come in handy.  Let your phone company know as well they may let you change your phone number for free.  I'm sorry your having to deal with it, I know this shit ain't fun. One of my ex -stalked me which is where the advice is coming from.", "Ya many more things happened, this is just a tip of an iceberg, but I will be careful now."]}
