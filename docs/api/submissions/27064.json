He was everything to me. Words cannot describe how much I loved him. We are Asians, and love marriages are not that common in my country, but we were determined to make it possible. It was a really toxic affair because he used to make me do all his work and fulfill all his needs; basically, I was performing all the wifely duties without being an actual wife. He dumped me three years ago because his parents found a potential bride for him and he could not let them down. I was shaken.\n\nHe was from a rich family, and I come from a humble background, but I never ever took a single penny from him or asked for any expensive shit. Once, during our final year of college, we both needed better laptops due to assignments and projects, but my parents weren't able to afford them at that time, but his father gifted him a more expensive one. I was upset, and let me be very clear: I was not jealous of him; I was just upset that we couldn't do anything about my laptop, but instead of supporting me, he said, \"Girls are liabilities, boys are assets, and of course your parents won't invest in a liability.\" We had a huge argument after this because I am a single child and I know my parents love me.\n\nFast forward to now. He is divorced and has a 1-year-old daughter with his now-ex-wife. I, on the other hand, am thriving in my career and have no plans on getting married. After 3 months of him begging me, my friends, and coming to my city, I agreed to meet him. He was hoping to reconcile, but I flat out told him to just leave me, and anyway, he has a \"liability\" to take care of now, in a sarcastic way. He got confused, so I reminded him about that incident. He got upset is an understatement, and he cursed me out in public. I got scared and left without even arguing. I have nothing against his child, but I think I did something absolutely wrong. It was not intended and happened in the heat of the moment.", "created_utc": 1694974464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16l7txo/aita_for_sarcastically_referring_to_my_exs_child/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he believed it then, why the big deal over reminding him about it now? Was it nice, polite or really necessary? No, not really. But sometimes throwing someone else's shit back at them is satisfying if only for a moment.", "NTA. This guy may have been nice to you in the past but he's a sexidt jerk who was only nice to you in the same way you're nice to an appliance. In that you don't compromise its ability to work for you but you still replace it when you want something better. So while calling his daughter that word might have been unnecessary, it showed him how he should feel if someone used his own words against someone he's supposed to care about.", "I feel like you actually didn't mean that his daughter is a liability or any woman in this world is, you just want to hurt him.\n\n\nNTA and you should block him from your life.", "NTA.  Funny how when a person's harsh words are used against them, they take umbrage.  Tough!  He deserves his miserable life and good for you being successful and happy.", "NTA.

Of course they are going to treat their son better. You sound ungrateful. I doubt this guy wanted anything to do with you. If anything you begged him to come see you just so you can be spiteful.

You haven't gone through that type of change yet. Understandably you want to hurt him the way he hurt you. However, you chose the wrong target. It was inappropriate of you to insult a child. While I'm sure it felt good to use those words back at him, it makes you immature to direct it towards them. \n\nHe should have been your target not his child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
