I had my son about a month ago. \nI live with at my moms and decided to have a baby shower after giving birth. The baby shower was held at our moms and I just wanted close family. My brother(28) and his girlfriend(26) have been together 5 years. They live together out of state from us, so we only see them a couple times a year. I sent an invite to brother obviously. \n\nFor the shower I made shirts for family members that said \u201cmom, dad, grandma\u201d etc\nI thought it would be cute for photos. I had an uncle shirt for my brother and he brought his gf with. I didn\u2019t have a shirt for her. They\u2019re not married, so I didn\u2019t think to make an \u201caunt\u201d shirt for her, or include her in family photos. Once the shirts were handed out she sat in the living room alone and was on her phone. It was awkward. \nI didn\u2019t let her hold the baby because her body language was closed off during the party and my brother was accommodating her half the time. I barely got to spend time with him. She was free to eat and join games but she didn\u2019t seem interested, and they ended up leaving early to go to her dads. (who also lives in the same city as us) Once the night passed my mom called my brother to ask what was up and my brother said his gf was very upset and felt excluded like she\u2019s not apart of our family. The party was literally for my newborn son and now it turned into drama. I feel like my brother is mad at me over this.

My partner and I are together for 13 (which is statistically longer than the average marriage around here) years by now. We live together for more than 10 and we are married in all but name. We love each other we are planning a future together, but we are not married and most likely will not marry because we don't feel like it. Nevertheless I feel like I am part of his family and he is part of mine. We refer to each other as \"my partner\" or even as \"husband/wife\" (which is very easy because around here my the word for my man/ my woman is the same as husband/wife).

It feels like he thinks we won't work out.\n\nThat is what you did. You did VERY CLEARLY show her and ANY OTHER PERSON at that party that you do not consider her family. Of course she was hurt and of course she was closed off. You singled her out.

Once the shirts were handed out she sat in the living room alone and was on her phone. It was awkward. \nI didn\u2019t let her hold the baby because her body language was closed off during the party and my brother was accommodating her half the time I barely got to spend time with him. She was free to eat and join games but she didn\u2019t seem interested, and they ended up leaving early to go to her dads who also lives in the same city as us.

What's really going on??", "Yeah you\u2019re definitely YTA. Just cause they\u2019re not married you consider their long term relationship not legitimate. If it were a few months or even a year or two I could maybe see it but five years come on. Then to not let her hold your baby cause her \u201cvibe\u201d was off.

Way to telegraph loud and clear that she is not part of your family! What does it take to be considered family, a legal marriage ceremony?  This is a really outdated mindset.

Wow.", "YTA not letting her hold the baby is ridiculous.", "YTA. 5 years. How long have you and your husband been together? Who cares if they aren\u2019t married? \nYou live with your mom, with a baby, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re following strict traditions like the ones you\u2019re enforcing. \nAs a side note, I remember when someone posted that their wife didn\u2019t want men at a baby shower, and he was expected to cancel invites for a party he planned, and leave the home for 10 hours. People in the comments lost their minds and accused him of ruining tradition. In reality, it should be about getting together, not set rules.

Even if you did not expect her to come (which you probably should have) you could have done so many things to make her included (grab a plain white tee and write on it something, or just ask her to be in the photos) You could have also avoided all of this if you would have talked to your brother before hand about this, although I would suspect that if you would have told him not to come with her someone would still become upset. In retrospect, be kinder to your brother\u2019s GF. I have been excluded myself as a GF and it is not nice. GF was right to be upset.", "YTA Plain and simple. Grow up.", "YTA!", "YTA.

I'm not. We aren't married. There's no evidence this relationship is permanent. \n\nI think it's absolutely your right to choose not to refer to someone who isn't legally part of your family as \"aunt\".

Maybe he will one day and on that day welcome her in with open arms. Further, unless she has proposed to him she doesn't care enough either. Choosing to remain bf/gf instead of husband and wife is their choice and you chose to respect it.", "YTA. Sounds to me like you\u2019re a bit jealous of the gf. Or at least of your bro and his partners relationship. I didn\u2019t see any mention of baby\u2019s father anywhere?  The gf stayed away and didn\u2019t try to steal your joy. You did that.

You are awful because you are a hypocrite.", "NTA. I am not married to my partner, and my brother is not married to his. I just had a child and did not get an auntie gift for his gf. She was not offended, and I was not offended either when I was on the other end. We dont refer to each other that way, although we are close. It would be nice to include her in some photos, but not in others (for posterity) because bfs/gfs do break up. Since this is an issue, you should apologize and ask her what she'd like to do going forward. Either way, you would have been commenting on their relationship by bestowing a status that he has yet to give. Next time, the lesson is to ask.\n\nIt was a little careless and unkind in such an intimate setting (probably fine at a larger party) to not have a plan for the one person who would be there but not in the photos (if I'm \nreading that right), but I definitely would try to talk it out and smooth things over. I see both sides on this one.", "YTA. Their relationship is longer than you\u2019ve been out of high school.

Also incredibly judgmental, which is surprising seeing that you yourself seem to be in a situation which is usually one that gets easily judged.\n\nYour brother and his girlfriend traveled all the way to see you and the baby. And you act like an entitled, spoiled brat. Just be kind and inclusive, is that so hard? \n\nCall her and apologize. Tell her that you were thoughtless and overwhelmed, and made a mistake. Tell her that you hope that you can fix this and build a relationship. You will need her help and support in the coming years. Trust me.", "I wonder how OPs mother didn\u2019t notice the exclusion.

But you have a lot to learn!!!  The way you treated your brother\u2019s LONG time gf was really rude and inexcusable even if you don\u2019t like her (which is apparently true).  You have expanded the family (congrats!) so now is the time to build bridges and strengthen family ties, when you have just done the opposite.  I suggest you find a way to extend an olive branch to this woman.  You might be sharing holidays and other important events with her FOREVER.

Its understandable that  she\u2019s hurt (after dating someone for 5 years i would think she\u2019s practically considered family) but by removing herself she did take away the attention from your newborn. HOWEVER, it wouldn\u2019t have hurt if your included her more. You didn\u2019t have to make her a shirt, but I do think you should have asked her to join in on the pics. She\u2019s been with your brother for 5 years, so not some random person, and it\u2019s probably safe to assume she will marry into the family some day. You also could have let her hold the baby and personally asked her to join in on the games. I\u2019m sure she felt like you didn\u2019t even want her here which is why she was isolating herself.

Your brother and his gf live out of state. So, there may not be the closeness, with you and her, but she didn\u2019t need to sulk. This wasn\u2019t about her. It was about you and your son. Maybe, to take a pic of them holding your son. I\u2019m wondering if this goes a bit deeper with her, being upset that she\u2019s not having the baby or getting married.

You know pregnancy only lasts +- 9 months.", "My sister is probably never going to marry her partner, but his brothers kids call me Aunty, and I love them, OP is clearly a very immature person, I would have told her to her face what I thought about her attitude.", "I'm white and in the US and my kids have several \"Aunties\" and \"Uncles\" who are not actually related.", "Or for birthdays, graduations etc", "\ud83d\udcb0\ud83c\udfc6\u269c\ufe0f\ud83e\udd47\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc51\u269c\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udcb0", "We let everyone in our photo's, one son is now married and another has a GF. They are all on the wall.  Even if those relationships change in the future they are important to my kids right now. I can also get and almost certainly well update photos in the future no matter anyone relationship status.  \n\n\nMy LC paternal family though only has an interest in DNA and people with marriage certs...  They tend to suck as a general rule.", "Exactly! I\u2019ve seen multiple posts over the years with people freaking out about wedding pictures. \n\n\u201cMy brother has been with his girlfriend for 10 years & wants her in the picture with him but they\u2019re not married so I don\u2019t want her in them!\u201d This is often said by someone marrying a partner they met a month ago. \n\n\u201cUncle Frank is on wife #5. AITA if I don\u2019t let her in the pictures?\u201d Turns out the family loves good old Uncle Frank & treat his marital merry go round as a fine family joke. But not in wedding pictures! Then it\u2019s a crime against humanity! \n\n\u201cOmg my parents got a divorce right after my wedding! What do I do with the wedding pictures they\u2019re in together?\u201d \n\nLife happens! People stress out so much about these things. Yes I get that breakups are painful but more for the people directly involved. Is it really that upsetting if your second cousin gets a divorce from the woman that\u2019s in your wedding photos? Can you never show those photos again because of it? \n\nI\u2019ve always been fonder of the truth, whether it\u2019s good or bad, instead of attempting to totally whitewash life. Breakups happen. Divorces happen. Using a marriage license as the sole criterion of the stability of a relationship is strange to me.", "That part was weird. Is OP trying to imply that the GF would hurt the baby or something?", "I heard he sat around all day, demanding people feed him, entertain him and wipe his butt whenever he wanted else he\u2019d just cry super loudly."]}
