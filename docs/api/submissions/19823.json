I had my son about a month ago. \nI live with at my moms and decided to have a baby shower after giving birth. The baby shower was held at our moms and I just wanted close family. My brother(28) and his girlfriend(26) have been together 5 years. They live together out of state from us, so we only see them a couple times a year. I sent an invite to brother obviously. \n\nFor the shower I made shirts for family members that said \u201cmom, dad, grandma\u201d etc\nI thought it would be cute for photos. I had an uncle shirt for my brother and he brought his gf with. I didn\u2019t have a shirt for her. They\u2019re not married, so I didn\u2019t think to make an \u201caunt\u201d shirt for her, or include her in family photos. Once the shirts were handed out she sat in the living room alone and was on her phone. It was awkward. \nI didn\u2019t let her hold the baby because her body language was closed off during the party and my brother was accommodating her half the time. I barely got to spend time with him. She was free to eat and join games but she didn\u2019t seem interested, and they ended up leaving early to go to her dads. (who also lives in the same city as us) Once the night passed my mom called my brother to ask what was up and my brother said his gf was very upset and felt excluded like she\u2019s not apart of our family. The party was literally for my newborn son and now it turned into drama. I feel like my brother is mad at me over this.

My partner and I are together for 13 (which is statistically longer than the average marriage around here) years by now. We live together for more than 10 and we are married in all but name. We love each other we are planning a future together, but we are not married and most likely will not marry because we don't feel like it. Nevertheless I feel like I am part of his family and he is part of mine. We refer to each other as \"my partner\" or even as \"husband/wife\" (which is very easy because around here my the word for my man/ my woman is the same as husband/wife).

It feels like he thinks we won't work out.\n\nThat is what you did. You did VERY CLEARLY show her and ANY OTHER PERSON at that party that you do not consider her family. Of course she was hurt and of course she was closed off. You singled her out.

It was awkward. \nI didn\u2019t let her hold the baby because her body language was closed off during the party and my brother was accommodating her half the time I barely got to spend time with him. She was free to eat and join games but she didn\u2019t seem interested, and they ended up leaving early to go to her dads who also lives in the same city as us.

That alone is rude enough.", "yta", "yea imma have to go with YTA here. I giant one at that.

What's really going on??", "Yeah you\u2019re definitely YTA. Just cause they\u2019re not married you consider their long term relationship not legitimate. If it were a few months or even a year or two I could maybe see it but five years come on. Then to not let her hold your baby cause her \u201cvibe\u201d was off.

Way to telegraph loud and clear that she is not part of your family! What does it take to be considered family, a legal marriage ceremony?  This is a really outdated mindset.

Wow.", "YTA not letting her hold the baby is ridiculous.", "YTA. 5 years. How long have you and your husband been together? Who cares if they aren\u2019t married? \nYou live with your mom, with a baby, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re following strict traditions like the ones you\u2019re enforcing. \nAs a side note, I remember when someone posted that their wife didn\u2019t want men at a baby shower, and he was expected to cancel invites for a party he planned, and leave the home for 10 hours.

YTA! Is there something between you and her? I think we are definitely missing some info but based on all of this it sounds like you did exclude her. People don\u2019t just feel excluded out of nowhere. Even if you did not expect her to come (which you probably should have) you could have done so many things to make her included (grab a plain white tee and write on it something, or just ask her to be in the photos) You could have also avoided all of this if you would have talked to your brother before hand about this, although I would suspect that if you would have told him not to come with her someone would still become upset. In retrospect, be kinder to your brother\u2019s GF. I have been excluded myself as a GF and it is not nice. GF was right to be upset.", "YTA Plain and simple. Grow up.", "YTA!", "YTA.

I'm not. We aren't married. There's no evidence this relationship is permanent. \n\nI think it's absolutely your right to choose not to refer to someone who isn't legally part of your family as \"aunt\".

You wouldn't let her hold the baby either?  Yeah, that whole thing is rude af, you didn't have to make her a shirt to include her.  Incredibly inconsiderate.

You excluded her from minute 1 and then act surprised that she stayed closed off in a place where she was very obviously not welcome.", "NTA, your brother clearly doesn't care about her enough yet to bring her into the family. Maybe he will one day and on that day welcome her in with open arms. Further, unless she has proposed to him she doesn't care enough either. Choosing to remain bf/gf instead of husband and wife is their choice and you chose to respect it.", "YTA. Sounds to me like you\u2019re a bit jealous of the gf.

With the judgement you passed on the GF my judgement is fair. You are awful because you are a hypocrite.", "NTA. I am not married to my partner, and my brother is not married to his. I just had a child and did not get an auntie gift for his gf. She was not offended, and I would not be offended either. I would say that it would be nice to include her in some photos, but not in others (for posterity). Since this is an issue, I'd say that you should apologize and ask her what she'd like to do going forward. \n\nIt was probably a little careless in such an intimate setting (probably fine at a larger party), but I definitely would try to talk it out and smooth things over. I see both sides on this one.", "YTA. Their relationship is longer than you\u2019ve been out of high school.

Also incredibly judgmental, which is surprising seeing that you yourself seem to be in a situation which is usually one that gets easily judged.\n\nYour brother and his girlfriend traveled all the way to see you and the baby. And you act like an entitled, spoiled brat. Just be kind and inclusive, is that so hard? \n\nCall her and apologize. Tell her that you were thoughtless and overwhelmed, and made a mistake. Tell her that you hope that you can fix this and build a relationship. You will need her help and support in the coming years. Trust me.", "I wonder how OPs mother didn\u2019t notice the exclusion.

That is longer than you have been an adult.\n\nWhat does baby daddy think of this?

But you have a lot to learn!!!  The way you treated your brother\u2019s LONG time gf was really rude and inexcusable even if you don\u2019t like her (which is apparently true).  You have expanded the family (congrats!) so now is the time to build bridges and strengthen family ties, when you have just done the opposite.  I suggest you find a way to extend an olive branch to this woman.  You might be sharing holidays and other important events with her FOREVER.

HOWEVER, it wouldn\u2019t have hurt if your included her more. You didn\u2019t have to make her a shirt, but I do think you should have asked her to join in on the pics. She\u2019s been with your brother for 5 years, so not some random person, and it\u2019s probably safe to assume she will marry into the family some day. You also could have let her hold the baby and personally asked her to join in on the games. I\u2019m sure she felt like you didn\u2019t even want her here which is why she was isolating herself.

Your brother and his gf live out of state. So, there may not be the closeness, with you and her, but she didn\u2019t need to sulk. This wasn\u2019t about her. It was about you and your son. Maybe, to take a pic of them holding your son. I\u2019m wondering if this goes a bit deeper with her, being upset that she\u2019s not having the baby or getting married.

Aunties and uncles from our old neighborhood, my mom\u2019s friends, etc. Their kids and us still call each other \u201ccousins.\u201d Lol. Though it seemed more POC thing here in US where I lived. More family to care about the kid won\u2019t hurt! As long as they aren\u2019t toxic or dangerous. More village is better off kiddo.", "I have several \"aunts,\" too. One in particular, who is just as much family as my blood. My grandma and her best friend (Boots) were so close that Boots held an official adoption ceremony for my grandma. Her whole family welcomed my grandma and my grandma's whole family into open arms. She was always Auntie to my dad growing up, and she's Auntie to us all now, even long after my grandma passed. Yesterday was my birthday, and Boots cried (Facetime) while she told me how much I look like her \"Dodie.\" We might not be related by blood, but that IS my Auntie. OP deprived her brother's gf of this type of love and acceptance. It's sad. \n\nOP yta", "Americans too. I have two \"aunts\" who really were just my mom's best friends.", "\"That woman in the corner that we're ignoring\"", "She says  she lives with her mom and brother...", "In the South in the US, they used to have (maybe still do?) \u201csip \u2018n sees,\u201d which was a party to introduce the baby to friends and family. They generally aren\u2019t a gift grab like a shower, but people did usually bring something for the baby.\n\nETA: I\u2019m old too! Old enough that we sent out birth announcements in the mail. LOL", "Oh my god yes! I used to be part of a group who held this belief firmly. Jokes on them though when the married family members ended up getting divorced and the folks they \u201cexcluded\u201d eventually got married and are still going to this day. Thus it\u2019s a stupid rule to go by.", "I think this is more immaturity related than hormone personally.", "That baby has only been around for a month, I certainly hope he didn't get a t-shirt. He needs to put in some more time!", "My friend's family did not like her husband. She was sent a birthday party invitation for her niece's birthday with only her name on the invitation. She and her husband thought that was tacky and her husband came to the birthday party anyway. My friend got into a big fight with her brother because her husband was excluded from the birthday party. Events like excluding someone from a family party can cause hurt, bitterness and drama.", "What was childish about the girlfriends response exactly? She rightfully felt excluded from the family she has been a part of for 5 years.", "Lots of people don't get married, they're still family", "There's a lot of reasons people choose to not get legally married and it's perfectly valid. Just because someone is not legally married to their partner does not make them any less of a family member.", "OP isn't married, she's still living with her mom and brother.", "She sucked it up when she travelled for several hours to go to a baby shower (and presumably bought a gift) to be supportive of her partners sister who made a point to not include her on an invitation to purposely exclude her.", "She's been his girlfriend since OP was 15. OP is definitely unkind.", "Yeah, this isn't back in the say of film cameras where you could only take a certain number of pictures. How hard is it to have her in for a few, and then ask to do smaller groups?", "I mean parents are totally *entitled* to decide who holds/interacts with their kids. However plenty of parents weaponise their kids against people in their circle, which seems to be what OP was doing, and is asshole behaviour.", "Eh, if you\u2019re passing a baby round for cuddles, excluding one specific person is still an asshole move unless they\u2019re likely to cause actual harm to the infant. Babies aren\u2019t toys but if mum is already happy to pass it round and allowing everyone except you to hold it for a couple of minutes, it is just mum making a point of \u2018you aren\u2019t good enough to hold my baby\u2019 and has nothing to do with the welfare of the infant. And that\u2019s a total asshole move.\n\nIt\u2019s such a petty \u2018power play\u2019 to allow everyone to hold your baby but then be like, \u2018Oh no not YOU, you aren\u2019t allowed to touch my baby.\u2019 Come on OP, grow up.", "She says she lives with her mom and brother but she did make up a \"Dad\" T-shirt.   She seems to think that his few moments of participation make him a close family member whereas her brother's gf of fie years is not.", "god forbid someone else has a supportive partner when OP doesn't", "Well someone had to pay attention to her!", "i think op wasnt planning on her attending. she says she sent her BROTHER an invite, not that she sent it for them. i think the point is op didnt want the gf there", "It makes no sense to me honestly. My kids are going to be so surprised most of their aunts and uncles aren\u2019t actually related to them by marriage or otherwise when they\u2019re older.", "This is such a great idea. OP says the party \u201cturned into drama\u201d, but that could have been avoided with better communication.", "My fianc\u00e9's family does this, when we were dating I either wasn't in the pictures or they'd take 1 set with me and 1 set without me / his brother's gfs.

Why did you treat her this badly? Was it the attention you wanted for yourself?", "This is not accurate at all.", "By the proper definitions, she isn\u2019t related.\n\nHowever, to most people, she would be considered the aunt. I had been with my partner for less time than five years when his nieces and nephews started to call me Auntie.", "I want to know how long OP and her baby daddy have been together since being with someone for 5 years isn't considered family", "It's not subtle, she very clearly excluded one member of a social unit.", "Not necessarily, I'm white and my parents friends were and still are aunt and uncle to me.", "Agreed. I'd like to assume positive intentions and think she just didn't think it through. Her mom didn't step in and stop her, though...", "Sulking by herself in another room during the party was childish.  I would have taken no issue with her reaching out to OP after the party to express her feelings about being excluded, but her approach effectively put other people in the middle and created an awkward situation for people who had no responsibility for OP\u2019s behavior.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "I understand what you\u2019re saying, and I agree that OP should have been more inclusive to his girlfriend. I\u2019m not saying that the way her brother\u2019s girlfriend acted was completely uncalled for. I do think though that it would have been better if she sucked it up and had her boyfriend talk with OP after the event about it. Completely isolating yourself from the rest of the party is going to make things awkward. The day was about the newborn baby and it was obvious enough that the rest of the family thought it was weird. Again, I\u2019m not saying what OB did was right, but I think there are better ways to handle the situation.", ".... She made a Dad shirt for the baby's dad... Why is that a point of contention. Just because they're long term partners doesn't make the gf automatically related. DNA does however, regardless of current relationship to op", "That\u2019s not a thing with long term partners. She\u2019s pretty much family even if op doesn\u2019t know her well.", "I\u2019m THAT aunt!!!", "\"Aunt\" is such a loose title anyway.\n\nMom had five high school friends that she met with twice a year.\n\nI had five non-biological aunts.", "Bonus aunt.

Partner and I were together for 2 years when we finally went out of state together and I met his nieces/nephews and fam. They immediately called me an aunt even though I insisted they didn't have to. It was sweet and made me feel so included and accepted even though it was odd to be called an aunt since I'm an only child.", "My best friends kids call me auntie. I've known them for 20+ years. They themselves will say we're going to visit auntie. I'm the cool fun aunt that will dance in the middle of the store aisle with them. There's no reason for the gf to be excluded like that.", "Hell, I\u2019m not related in any way to my friends\u2019 kids and they\u2019ll call me Auntie from time to time.", "Good observation! I hadn't thought of that. You'd think mom would say \"hey include your brothers gf too\" if she liked her.", "What relevance does that have here?", "Assuming much?", "Or she is just upset that after 5 years she isn't considered family. I would be upset if that happened. I've been with my partner for over a decade, but have no desire to get married. If his sisters treated me like OP did I would be upset, and not because he hasn't proposed (because he knows I wouldn't want that at ALL).", "I disagree, it seems to me that the OP is taking things out on her brother and GF because she (the OP) doesn't have a stable relationship with her baby daddy.   The whole business of not allowing someone she's known for  years to even hold the baby was petty to the extreme.   Actually, she messed up when she seemed to expect her brother to travel without his 5-year partner.", ">DNA does however\n\nHahahaha no\n\nDNA means you're biologically related.  Family is based on relationships and connections.", "Nope nope nope. Not allowing \"blood is thicker than water\" shit here.", "im not saying shes correct i was clarifying for the other commenter who said she could have asked what she wouldve wanted on the shirt. op would not have asked what she wanted on the shirt bc she clearly has an issue with the gf and didnt invite her", "Well it\u2019s pretty obvious OP doesn\u2019t consider the GF family based on her actions. Doesn\u2019t invite her, excludes here from pics, doesn\u2019t let her hold the baby, and doesn\u2019t include her in the shirts, of which she made for family members.
