{"id": 27044, "submission_id": "16ktiqf", "title": "WIBTA for speaking to the manager about my waitress after terrible service?", "selftext": "So I went out to eat with my boyfriend for breakfast/ lunch. I decided I wanted to try this local place that had just opened and had this one specific menu item I wanted. We went, it was a 35 minute estimated wait for a table. I said okay, it took about 30 until we were seated. Not a big deal. Then the waitress came to get our drink orders and she looked at me surprised and said \u2018Oh, hey!\u2019 Like she recognized me. She looked familiar but I couldn\u2019t place it. Ordered myself a drink and my boyfriend got some water. He had to step outside for a work related call so it was just me at the table for some time. At first the waitress came over and asked if I wanted another drink and I said yes. She checked on me a few times. Then about an hour passed, no food. Everyone in the tiny restaurant got their food but I didn\u2019t. The waitress kept checking on the table directly in front of me but wouldn\u2019t say anything to me or come to my table. Finally she comes over, we\u2019ve been here about two hours at this point. My boyfriend said let\u2019s just get it to go because I had work and so did he. I asked her how long it would take. She said she would go check. She went to the back and then some random man comes over, says sorry there was some kind of glitch with my order (when they put it in ectronically I guess?) and it \u2018was there and then it wasn\u2019t\u2019 and that it was \u2018coming up.\u2019 They gave me 10 percent off and a free alcoholic beverage worth 10 bucks. And btw, food wasn\u2019t all that when I finally ate it at work. Anyway, I remembered who the waitress was because her name was on the receipt. She was associated with my childhood bullies in elementary school. I just think it\u2019s weird that only OUR order had a \u2018glitch\u2019 and that she didn\u2019t check on me for 45 minutes to an hour. Should I say something, because I filed out a survey and they might call me to get \u2018more info\u2019 it said. I get it, it\u2019s hard to be a waitress but checking on everyone but me? WIBTA for mentioning the poor service of this waitress? And no, I didn\u2019t say anything or complain in any way, shape or form about anything that happened while we were there.", "created_utc": 1694932613, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ktiqf/wibta_for_speaking_to_the_manager_about_my/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You already got a discount and a free drink. What would your purpose be in calling? Getting her fired over something you can\u2019t prove happened?\n\nBut seriously, who sits in a small restaurant for 2 hours waiting for food without asking where it was? Did you think they were out mowing down wheat, and butchering the pigs for sausage and bacon?", "NTA. However, I would have left after an hour of no service.", "ESH\u2026The time to say something was in the first hour of no food or check-in by the server. Learn to speak up in the moment so that the correction can be made then. But you didn\u2019t, but still the manager already comped you a drink and discounted your meal, you can\u2019t be mad now that you *think maybe* the server did it on purpose. That\u2019s petty.", "NTA\n\nBut yes if anybody calls, be honest  \nThe waitstaff is supposed to be the middleman between the customer and the kitchen - if the food is delayed, they smooth things over with you and set expectations, not pretend you don't exist.  She surely knew that you were waiting and waiting and waiting.  It's perfectly appropriate to say that she ignored you for approximately #minutes, and there was no communication about why your food wasn't arriving.", "YWNBTA.  I've worked in restaurants forever.  I'm guessing there was no glitch and she just forgot to put in the order.  Basically a pocket ticket and they made something up to cover her mistake.", "Info:\n\nHow long was the BF gone for the calls?\n\n>He had to step outside for a work related call so it was just me at the table for some time. At first the waitress came over and asked if I wanted another drink and I said yes. She checked on me a few times. Then about an hour passed, no food.\n\nThe way this is worded makes it seem like you were at the restaurant for an hour by yourself as your bf was outside making multiple work calls.\n\nIf this is the case, I can see the waitress holding off on the ticket while your bf was not present.", "Yeah, I'd say mention it. That's shitty service and probably why they're asking for more info on the survey. Just keep it professional though - nobody likes to be called out on their bad behavior. Don't make it personal and try not to come across as petty or trying to get revenge.", "NTA\n\nYou had a bad experience. Period.", "You would not be the jerk in this situation. Your response is justified and whether or not this person had a past connection to you doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. She did a poor job acting professionally and it seems alright for you to speak about her performance.", "Nta. Honestly you're grown now and shouldn't take her shit anymore love. You should have said something about it 30 -45 mins in of not receiving your food. At least stopped her in the passing chances and shouldn't let her get away with it. Obviously she still thinks she can treat you like dog shit which isn't cool.", "It's her job. There are certain expectations and she didn't meet them. You're well within your right to speak on your experience. Personal stuff aside, you still had crappy service. Nta", "I would give her the benefit of the doubt simply because your order may have been cleared from the expo screen by the kitchen on accident. \n\nIt sucks that it happened but it was probably not intentional, and as a hospitality worker for 15 years I can say that things like this do happen and it\u2019s not in your servers interest to give shitty service because she relies on tips to live.", "Let it go, don't go back, leave a google review if you really feel so inclined but otherwise, move on.", "Nta but the ship has sailed. Leave a bad review and don\u2019t visit again", "Yes.  YWBTA.  Stop assuming a conspiracy against you.  The manager came out and explained.  She wasn't rude to you. \n\nIt was a busy time if you had to wait for a table and your BF was out for however long taking a call.  To me your table could have just as easily slipped her mind because she didn't see the 2 of you there.  And there was a system glitch.  \n\nAnd frankly even if she purposefully delayed your order....how miserable must her life be that this is the only thing she can do to have power over people?", "When in doubt rat her out.  Anyway, it's always proper to give feedback in an unsatisfactory customer service situation, especially if you are factual and don't let it be tainted by revenge.  NTA.", "NTA. Its a flashback of the trauma bullying caused. \n\nThe waitress is an asshole - not just because of shitty service. \n\nImagine being a bully and going upto your victim eons later as they have moved on in life and asking - \"you look familiar\" \"do I know you\" \n\nShitty shit person that one.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
