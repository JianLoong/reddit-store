I decided I wanted to try this local place that had just opened and had this one specific menu item I wanted. We went, it was a 35 minute estimated wait for a table. I said okay, it took about 30 until we were seated. Not a big deal. Then the waitress came to get our drink orders and she looked at me surprised and said \u2018Oh, hey!\u2019 Like she recognized me. She looked familiar but I couldn\u2019t place it. Ordered myself a drink and my boyfriend got some water. He had to step outside for a work related call so it was just me at the table for some time. At first the waitress came over and asked if I wanted another drink and I said yes. She checked on me a few times. Then about an hour passed, no food. Everyone in the tiny restaurant got their food but I didn\u2019t. The waitress kept checking on the table directly in front of me but wouldn\u2019t say anything to me or come to my table. Finally she comes over, we\u2019ve been here about two hours at this point. My boyfriend said let\u2019s just get it to go because I had work and so did he. I asked her how long it would take. She said she would go check. She went to the back and then some random man comes over, says sorry there was some kind of glitch with my order (when they put it in ectronically I guess?) and it \u2018was there and then it wasn\u2019t\u2019 and that it was \u2018coming up.\u2019 They gave me 10 percent off and a free alcoholic beverage worth 10 bucks. And btw, food wasn\u2019t all that when I finally ate it at work. Anyway, I remembered who the waitress was because her name was on the receipt. She was associated with my childhood bullies in elementary school. I just think it\u2019s weird that only OUR order had a \u2018glitch\u2019 and that she didn\u2019t check on me for 45 minutes to an hour. Should I say something, because I filed out a survey and they might call me to get \u2018more info\u2019 it said. I get it, it\u2019s hard to be a waitress but checking on everyone but me? WIBTA for mentioning the poor service of this waitress? And no, I didn\u2019t say anything or complain in any way, shape or form about anything that happened while we were there.\n\nEDIT: When I said \u2018I had been there for two hours\u2019 I included the 30 minutes we waited for the table. I meant the total time. So I had been waiting for food for an hour and thirty minutes if this matters. Also, my boyfriend ordered before he stepped out.", "created_utc": 1694932613, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ktiqf/wibta_for_speaking_to_the_manager_about_my/", "score": 218, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should have said something about it 30 -45 mins in of not receiving your food. At least stopped her in the passing chances and shouldn't let her get away with it.

It also sounds like they were extremely busy and a new spot is bound to have kinks and make mistakes. I am service industry and personally I would just not go back to that restaurant. The manager should have at least comped a meal for your wait, 10% is nothing. The server could have been acting malicously or she could've been busy and just not have done her due diligence in checking on your food. The kitchen could have just screwed up your order and she felt awkward coming over because frankly you can only say so much when the kitchen just goes sideways. It sounds to me like the whole place is a miss and you have nothing to gain from complaining after the fact. If the food is bad and the wait is long that place probably won't stay around very long anyways.", "YTA - the manager came and explained what happened. if you were upset or wanted something else done, the time to speak up was then, certainly not now.", "You could be AH bc after 30 mins and no food you just sat there looking hungry? \ud83d\ude02... sipping on your sippy drink without checking on your order.

Sure complain about the restaurant wait time but she doesn\u2019t make the food it\u2019s not her fault.", "NTA but you can\u2019t prove that the waitress did this \u201con purpose\u201d. At this point, you can only go by what the restaurant told you which is that there was a system issue and that\u2019s why your food was delayed. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the waitress did it on purpose. \n\nI\u2019d say if the restaurant does call you back, explain the whole situation to them but don\u2019t make any assumptions or accusations about the waitress. Tell them that you were waiting too long and someone finally came to your table to tell you it\u2019s due to a system issue and you got compensation for the wait but it\u2019s strange that it took the restaurant 2 hours to realize this. That is poor service on their end so you have the right to voice that to them. Then see where the conversation goes from there. \n\nIdk what other action the restaurant can take tbh since you already got compensated. But if you\u2019re looking to give them feedback for the sake of constructive criticism then go ahead.

They should have given you the meal for free.  Next time, speak up earlier.", ">What would your purpose be in calling? Getting her fired over something you can\u2019t prove happened?\n\nI'm pretty sure that's exactly what she wants. Petty revenge on someone who was just associated with OP's childhood bullies, not even one of the actual bullies. \n\nOP really needs to go to therapy if she's still this hung up on something that happened at least a decade ago if not much longer. I was also bullied mercilessly as a kid, but there's no point in holding a grudge for so long. It's extremely unhealthy and accomplishes nothing.", "I've waited an hour+ before for food without asking, but each time I understood what was going on. The first time, a huge group of us (like 30+ people) descended on a diner after clubbing. In retrospect, we should have given them a heads up at the beginning of the week. Still, no one gave them trouble for the wait and I at least tipped well.\n\nThe 2nd time, my friends and I (5 top) were so hungover, that it took a while for us to realize, hey we haven't been serviced, what gives? They were super slammed and had three new people *and* a newly promoted hostess and one of the new people was supposed to be our waitress who didn't realize we were her table.", "Also he had sat down and ordered right away! Then he stepped out", "Never had that happen at any other restaurant when any other person in my party had to step out/ wasn\u2019t there yet. Also, she still could\u2019ve checked on me because I was ordering alcoholic beverages and had already ordered two before she stopped coming by because I wanted to order more! Lastly, I personally don\u2019t control his work schedule and the fact that he had to go take a call. Why should I be ignored just because my boyfriend stepped out? Also, should the kitchen be told to stop my order just because my boyfriend wasn\u2019t at the table?

She had other seated tables.  That part is her fault. I mean I would not call and get her fired, but I wouldn\u2019t have tipped her more than 15%.", "I don\u2019t want any compensation. I just don\u2019t think the service I received was right and what if she is this inattentive to other tables too?", "It says the waitress was associated with the bullies, back in elementary school. So she wasn't a bully hersel based on that statement.", "Im also pretty shy, once I ordered something in a restaurant and seemingly it took a long time. Everyone else got their food and I was still waiting, it was probably about 45 minutes and I was getting a little pissed. So I walked over there and politely asked why I haven't gotten my food yet. Turns out there was a glitch on the system or something like that and they couldn't see my order. They apologized and I got my food within 10 minutes. I can't imagine being that shy that you sit hungry for 2 hours because you can't mutter 'hey we ordered a long time ago can you check on our order?.", "Asking a question about your food isn\u2019t confrontation.  Stop mentally escalating everything to confrontation when a simple conversation can fix things.\n\nIt seems that you\u2019re in need of a backbone.  Consider talking to someone about how afraid you are.", "If you want to complain, do so. While it would be optimal to complain in the moment, the owner should know how his staff handle mistakes. You should have been comped fully, not 10% off and a drink, for your over an hour late food.", "When they (servers at a restaurant) look at you, it\u2019s a visual check. That\u2019s when you make a motion or indicate in some way that you\u2019d like to speak to them.\n\nBoth of you could have communicated better in this situation.", "Just curious- you were ordering alcoholic drinks before going to work?", "Because waiters want to come to the table when they can order for everyone. And they want to avoid that you complain the food got delivered while not everyone was there. If you are going to be away from the table long, you should say the food can come no matter what.", "Ok if you think it\u2019s justified then you can complain about her. Yes I agreed the service was poor and you can voice that to them. I just wasn\u2019t sure about the waitress bc you didn\u2019t have proof that she purposely didn\u2019t come to your table. But if you\u2019re concerned that she might have been like this with other tables too then go ahead.", "It's almost as if that's why she's looking to reddit for advice.

Frankly, that serves no one, and could easily make you seem bitter.", "I seriously doubt they will call you back.

If you won't advocate for yourself, who will?", "Making eye contact is not enough to indicate you need something. Did you try waving at her or doing literally anything else besides look at her to let her know you needed to speak with her?", "Because the service I received from her wasn\u2019t good tbh\u2026.
