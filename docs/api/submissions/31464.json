People can find you. There are so many weirdos on the Internet. Also, if you Google yourself, does this fanfic show up?? That... might not look great to potential employers. Not to mention your family and friends who actively use Wattpad and might see it.\n\nIt's a very serious privacy issue and a breach of trust. You did not give her permission to use your name and real-life description in this way, and you're NTA for being upset.", "NTA. At the minimum she needs to change the names in the fan-fiction and other personal info. Would she like it if you wrote public fan-fiction about her with all her personal info?\n\nNote: this is NOT legal advice. If she refuses to take it down or change the info about you, I\u2019d consider contacting a lawyer. Depending on where you live, doxing is illegal and a lawyer might be able to write a Cease and Desist letter telling her to remove/change the info she published online. LegalShield is low-cost legal counsel ($32/month) and helped me with family law issues. If you decide to go the legal route, take screenshots of the fan-fiction and document EVERYTHING.\n\nBest of luck!", "NTA: Right off the bat, using your full name without permission is already a huge no no. You just don't do that without permission. But it's also completely valid to be uncomfortable with this regardless of sexuality. This is someone basically putting you in a sexual position you never consented to. Fan-Fics of real people can already be pushing the line at least, but when it's people you actually know, that's getting into a gross territory.\n\nThe fact she so immediately went on the offensive though is really upsetting. A good partner in that situation who just wasn't thinking ahead of time would realize \"oh, I've done something that clearly upsets my partner and is making them uncomfortable. I need to take a step back and think about what to do here.\" I'd imagine a good part of that reaction is from this being something important to her like a serious passion project. But that doesn't make her going against or behind your boundaries ok. And it doesn't make it her place to tell you how you can or can't feel about it.\n\nI don't like being the \"just dump her guy\". But if she can't respect basic boundaries, as well as just general respect for privacy both online and offline. She isn't likely going to change with how she's acting.\n\nThe petty part of me though is thinking you should just start talking about her having sex with other women, even when other people are around. I mean, clearly there's nothing to be upset about, right? But that's just my petty side, and I don't think it would be worth the effort, nor would she get the message.\n\nSorry for the rant.", "NTA. She should not be using your name without your permission, period. That's not \"restraining\" her fantasy life, that is asking not to be non-consensually included in it. \n\nWhat she did is a violation on multiple levels. And it would be easy for her to change the name and one or two characteristics.", "NTA, that's creepy and weird obsessive behavior.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is creepy and weird, break up with her", "Definitely NTA. Could you try reporting her account to Wattpad? Surely if you tell them you know her, and she's used your full name and description in her stories without consent, they would take them down for you.", "NTA, She\u2019s weird for that. Not even for the gay pairing, just for writing fan fiction about a real normal person. I understand writing fan fiction about celebrities, but real people you know who DONT know you\u2019re writing about them? She should\u2019ve asked for your consent beforehand. You have every right to be upset", "NTA. This is SO fucked and such an insane violation. OP, I\u2019m so sorry. You could realistically take legal action against her for using your full name and likeness if she doesn\u2019t take it down.", "NTA at all!!!  \nIn things I write (which I'm nowhere near putting out in public just yet) I have descriptions that may vaguely look like people in my life, because we take inspiration from things around us, but I am very careful to a) never make it so that descriptions are close enough to recognise - there are a lot of black haired, brown eyed women in the world... and b) absolutely never ever use a full name!! if a story gets popular enough, those wattpad or AO3 links end up very VERY accessible with google", "NTA\n\nYour girlfriend sounds creepy. Why does she need to write about you specifically in that context? She could write a real fiction instead.", "NTA it's really out of line, demand she delete it. Then end relationship there is something seriously wrong with her and she is gaslighting you.", "NTA.\n\n\nI wrote a lot of fanfic in my late teens/early 20s.\n\nAnd I never even used my OWN real name, let alone anyone else's. There were a few times I used very obvious replacements, but even 25 years ago I knew not to use real names.", "NTA.  She is using your likeness without your permission.  If she is using your full name and any sort of description of you that's... well, not ok to do without asking.  And you didn't tell her not to write it, but not to make it public.\n\nThat would really bother me too.  And in case anyone thinks it's because of the gay part, I wouldn't want anything sexual about me out there like that OR anything holistically untrue.  So, it would be the same if it put me out there as a big sports fan or into fashion (I'm not into either).\n\nIt's not that hard to change a character's name. She is being TA for not considering your feelings.", "NTA. \n\nOP you need to break up with this girl ASAP. She doesn't respect your boundaries and I wouldn't be surprised if she pushes the issue further.\n\nGTFO while you still can", "NTA, names are supposed to be changed for a reason. That literally puts you in danger, or could lead to discrimination. You can't say she should stop completely, but she should at the very least change the name and apologize.", "What in the actual fuck did I just read? NTA dude. \n\nHonestly, you might be able to reach out to Wattpad and let them know. It's a major breach of privacy and there are laws against it. If she's been writing with your name since you started dating, you were a minor as well. That's majorly illegal.\n\nLook for their customer service/helpline and see if you can't email them to get those pulled down for your safety. She can go be upset all she likes, that's super dangerous.", "NTA and technically this is against the law. She cannot legally use your image and likness without permission - even if it is fanfic.", "NTA.\n\nDump her and run far.\n\nWhen I was about 13, I wrote some exceedingly awful self insert Jonas Brothers fanfiction (I know. I cringe so hard thinking about it now) and used my real name and my friend\u2019s real name. I forgot about it for years until my friend brought it up when we were about 20, because it came up when you googled her name and she was worried about future employers. So I deleted it, after spending ages trying to get into my old account.\n\nMy point is that I made a stupid mistake when I was 13 and as soon as it was pointed out to me, I rectified it. Your girlfriend is 18, did this deliberately and threw a tantrum when you asked her to delete it.\n\nAlso, writing explicit gay fanfic about your straight boyfriend is just straight up weird and disgusting. Having the other person be an actual person is also disgusting.\n\nLike I said, I wrote real person fanfic. But I was 13, there was nothing explicit (I don\u2019t think I even wrote any kissing) and I stopped writing RPF not long after that. I think it\u2019s pretty gross to write like that about actual real people, especially because the kind of fans who write fanfic like that are also the sort to rabidly hate their chosen celebrity\u2019s partners. Ugh.", "NTA. She shouldn't be using your full name. That's completely out of line. \n\nYou could compromise by asking her to use an alias at the very least.", "NTA while i am a fujoshi and an avid fanfic enjoyer.\n\nThis is too far.\n\nThats ur literal full name. I would definitely take this further if she doesnt at least change the name.\n\nI cant lie though this is hilarious and im glad i decided to stay up and scroll reddit instead of sleeping now.", "I had to read the title twice, like what?", "NTA. The obvious AH behaviour aside, fetishising gay men is also not great. Never mind that the gay men she\u2019s fetishising aren\u2019t actually gay. Creepy, weirdo behaviour tbh", "NTA WHAT THE FUCK. ABOUT YOU AND A REAL CELEBRITY??? WHAT????", "nta, but wtf have i just read.....", "NTA, I read a lot of gay fanfic and Im absolutely against using real people in fics. Same with shipping real people. Its just weird and disrespectful. Also, using your name?? Nah man, thats going way too far. She is not respecting your boundaries.\n\nDepending on the situation this could actually be enough to sue her if she insists on using your name.", "I'd be pissed off too.  It'd be over then and there.  Next I'd be sending her a CERTIFIED LETTER.  Informing her to change and remove any likeness of you in that fan fic.  If she refused.  I'm going to an attorney.  Not only rude this behavior violates several laws.", "NTA- she made a homoerotic story about you down to the most minor detail and exploits that in an extremely gross fashion. Not to mention that she lit you up so quickly when you asked for her to stop as it made you uncomfortable, she's exploiting you and your identity especially in a public space used by family and friends. You aren't the AH, but your gf's response paired with her use of you without consent in a public erotic context makes her one gross, creepy AH.", "NTA, what girls typically do in these scenarios is talk to their friends about it and then the friends get together to roast/advise the partner. Your gf is an AH for using your actual full name to write this type of crap, if you remain with her, you\u2019re essentially telling her you don\u2019t really care.", "NTA: If she\u2019s using your real name and description then it\u2019s not very fictional, and with a male K-pop member?\n\nEven if you were gay/bi/pan, this can be seen as defamation of character. Might need to chat with her parents/guardians about her fan fic including you.\n\nPersonally, I write fan fiction myself but never ship REAL people. I\u2019ve sadly witness the number of crazy people K-pop members have to deal with, never mind fans!", "Nta - this is horrifying. And the fact she\u2019s getting defensive about it is even worse.\n\nMy god, run, run!", "NTA \n\nShe\u2019s gaslighting you. You don\u2019t use people\u2019s full names in fictional stories! It doesn\u2019t matter the sexual orientation, you don\u2019t do it. What makes it even worse is she didn\u2019t ask for your permission. And yes, she should have. It\u2019s one thing if you make up a name, and it happens to be someone you don\u2019t know. It\u2019s another thing when you have direct access to the person and you go and take their name as if you have the right to it.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to change the name. That is so not okay.\n\nAnd then you need to really truly consider if you can a) trust her and b) be with someone who\u2019d do this and then argue with you when you had a problem with it.", "You should turn it into a non-fic to show her who\u2019s boss. NTA BTW", "NTA. You can't control what she writes, but that's a very reasonable request and she should respect your feelings. How hard would it be to change his name and hair color? This sounds like the kind of behavior that is probably a symptom of larger problems, but I don't know. Like do your feelings just not matter to her at all?", "NTA", "NTA\nShe used your full name.  That can become a huge complication for you.  Google your name and see if that comes up.  Every job you ever interview for is going to google you.  Get this scrubbed as soon as you can.", "NTA. First things first she doesn't care about about your feelings one bit nor does she respect you. You asked for her not to use you and your name in her written fantasies and she made you out to be the bad guy. You're not. I hate to say this but you may need to consider breaking it off.", "NTA WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK", "NTA I cannot believe she did this to you", "NTA - kpop fans are literally unhinged creeps", "As a fanfic writer, NTA. She should not have done that.", "NTA. That's the fucking creepiest thing I've read in a long time. You should probably break up with her because she is definitely crazy.", "NTA. She used your name and description.l", "What the heeeeeelll", "This is fucking hilarious to me. But also very fucked up. NTA and you should do something about it. This is serious and dangerous to your privacy and safety.", "Defamation lawsuit . Lawyer up ...", "NTA. She has no right to use your exact likeness and Information for her weird fetishisation of gay men.   You aren\u2019t restraining her in any way. She does not have a right to make you the star of her smut just because she thinks it\u2019s super sexy.", "NTA she's fucked, stand your ground. This is crazy.", "I would break up with her immediately. If my name and likeness was being used for erotic fiction I would be contacting a lawyer.", "Ofc you're NTA. What the hell? I like to draw my friends and mutuals every now and then, and if I wanna post those drawings I ALWAYS ask for permission from people in question. Even though they're my drawings and SFW. When I was reading your text I kept thinking \"That's GOTTA be illegal\". Tv-series, books and other story formats often state something along lines \"All similarities with real people and events are purely coincidental\", no? Isn't that to avoid legal trouble? It wouldn't be as bad (though still weird imo) if she was just writing for herself, but she DEFINITELY can't just go and publish something like that. I really hope you do something about this and get some justice.", "NTA. That is completely out of line. She should not be posting your personal info. Doesn't matter that the personal info is in a fanfiction, she still released your personal info. You might want to get some legal advice if she doesn't take your personal info out of the stories. It could count as doxxing, but I'm no legal expert.", "NTA - Bro, as a former fan fic writer and was part of that community, there is an unwritten rule that we **DON'T WRITE FICS BASED ON REAL PEOPLE**. It's weird, creepy, and in your case, a huge invasion of privacy.\n\nThere is a difference on writting based on a character a person is playing and the actual person itself. What your girlfriend did is super uncalled for and she has no right to be mad when you ask her to stop, esp when she's using your entire name and personality. Huge no no, esp if you didnt have consent.", "NTA. Dump her. Seriously, something is wrong with her for that. Especially her lack of care about your comfortability, you do not want that in any partner, especially not a life-long one. She probably has some kind of cheating kink if she\u2019s writing fantasies like that too. She\u2019s no good.", "NTA. She\u2019s one of *those* kpop stans. I\u2019d run far away.", "Nta", "NTA. This is super disturbing and a massive violation. It's a breach of privacy and consent. If she wants to fantasize in the privacy of her bedroom, that's her call to make, but publishing where anyone can see is gross and cruel and probably illegal.", "Threaten to sue and break up with her. NTA. Kidding about suing but that\u2019s not right what she\u2019s doing.", "NTA.\n\nShe is doxxing and writing rape erotica about you. I also won't post it here but it took three google searches and a quick look at your reddit history to find your name, social media and the 7 part series of you K POPPIN'.", "NTA and I\u2019d think about suing her if I were you. What she did is creepy and a breach of trust.", "Wait till an employer does a background check on you.. it will pop up", "NTA.  You need to reevaluate your relationship b/c your gf crossed a line.", "NTA \n\nI've privately written stories about my partner, but that's intentionally for us to enjoy, not for me to publish somewhere. This is so not kosher for like the bdsm or kink community. She doesn't have your consent to write about you, using your name, using your description and identity. \n\n100% contact moderators of whatever community she's publishing too. Start reporting everyone of the pieces with you referenced. \n\nYou don't deserve to be treated like this, I don't usually jump to break ups, but if she doesn't get it together, and continues to gaslight you about this- I'd consider whether or not it's a healthy space to occupy.", "nta, if someone's writing anything about you, never mind if it's explicate or not, it's you, so if it makes you uncomfortable and you want it taken down she should take it down.", "INFO: did you ask why she sent you the link? \n\nDoesn't change my judgement of NTA, but I'm just curious what she was thinking", "NTA \nYou\u2019re entitled to your privacy", "NTA. This is wrong on so many levels. You aren't restraining her by asking her not to write these fanfics about you, you are setting a completely reasonable boundary. Unfortunately, she is probably already very invested in the fanfics, considering the 7 part series, which is why she immediately got defensive. Hold your ground, OP!\n\nYou should also explain to her that those kpop singers are already public figures, so their names and appearances are already public information. She is violating your privacy by writing about you, using your real name and description online. I say this as a fanfic writer and a kpop fan: your girlfriend has crossed your boundaries and is disrespecting you by refusing to take down the fanfics. She has a right to express herself, but she does NOT have a right to expose your personal details online and write stories revolving around you that are making you uncomfortable.", "Feel free to write some stories about her", "Omg this is so funny \ud83d\ude02. Bro yeah just dump her this girl has no boundaries. This has to be one of the funniest aita", "NTA. I\u2019m not putting down the LGBTQ+ community, but there\u2019s real haters out there that do hate the gay community and you could start to be threatened or worse. This is why a person\u2019s real name and description isn\u2019t used in fiction. These wack jobs don\u2019t/can\u2019t/won\u2019t distinguish reality from fiction.

Make sure to use as many fetishes you can stick in there. The more unsettling or concerning the better. Write her dialogue in such a way that is just super pumped to be involved and a very enthusiastic if not downright gushing about how much she loves it all. Just to show her you're a good sport and encouraging her treatment of your fictional self. Hell, if you really want to be a good guy you could even change one letter of her name to respect her privacy and show her how easy that would have been.", "Had she changed your name, I wouldn't have seen the issue, but using your name, if you apply to a job and they search your name, they land on a gay story with a pretty precise description of you.\n\nNow while being gay shouldn't be an issue, there will be someone who would find this kind of story, using your name, problematic in regard to hiring you...\n\nSo you're most definitely NTA.\n\nAsk her how she would feel if you wrote stories, using her exact description, and name, where she was an extremely racist homophobe who liked torturing animals.\n\nWhile the latter is of course an extreme, one could just argue that it's \"fiction\" and part of your \"creativity\" to write stories, so why would she care, unless she's willing to admit that using your full name can be problematic even though it's just fiction.", "INFO: Send us the link so we can make an informed decision. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA, were you giving or receiving from K-Pop?\n\nFrom what I know of them you are a little old for their liking, male or female.", "YTA for having to ask if YTA & not demanding that be taken down immediately.

I remember reading something about Supernatural had this huge thing blown up with shipping especially BL shipping that the main actors had to say something about it. I\u2019ve also seen it with some anime/games that certain fans seriously get extremely upset if their ship isn\u2019t happening. I recall Mineta from MHA had the LGBT ppl super pissed cuz you find out he\u2019s actually bi instead of straight.

But yeah, asking anyone to sign that kind of stuff is messed up.", "I feel bad for the fanfiction writers who, yeah might ship *characters* (not all do!), but ultimately don't fetishize them, fetishize mental illnesses, get WEIRD with the actors/creators, or worse get effed up with things like Non-Con/minor characters/abuse/violence/etc.\n\nPeople like OPs hopefully soon to be *ex* girlfriend ruin it. Loud, overly invested, with 0 sense for reason or boundaries!\n\nReal Person Fanfiction is looked down upon pretty harshly in most fandom spaces and most people even in the communities I've been in in the distant past would absolutely call her out for the creepy nonsense. Corners of AO3 exist for it, but it is FAR from acceptable even to most of what I call \"the fandom crazies\"\n\nThey just use these characters to either alter their existing story, continue on with new stories, and/or take those characters (appearance, personality, etc) and use them to make totally new unrelated stories. It can take the pressure off, using pre-made and fleshed out characters. \n\nIt can allow the authors to focus more on world-building (locations, cultures, languages, backstory), it can allow the authors to focus on character study (how would this character react to THIS) and it can allow for more focus on plot.\n\nThe \"good ones\" exist in droves, quietly making millions of good stories and bad stories for free, some of them longer than War and Peace, creating simply because they wanted to see this story out there but as per usual the loud weirdos have to be the face of it.\n\nHeck, a lot of stories that were published in Sci-Fi communities as books if not published, could be considered fanfiction as they were not made by the original creators.\n\nLike Star Trek or Doctor Who novels not based on episodes. Yes they were published, but the point I'm making is that I've read fanfiction nearly indistinguishable from those types of stories. (ie not fetishistic or whatever other description we could apply to *that* kind of fanfiction)\n\nThat said, I freaking HATE when someone either brings up fanfiction or fanart to an actor or creator. Most of the people I knew who have written fanfiction or made fanart would agree with me here. \n\nI hate it particularly when it's a talk show host taking excerpts from a fanfiction author and using it to make the guest uncomfortable, thereby humiliating their guest but also the author because MOST fanartists would not want that. Yeah it's published, but they're not all assholes wanting secretly for Robert Downey Jr to find their Iron Man fanfiction, but normal people writing stories about a character because it tickles the creative side of their brain. \n\nOr when someone does something similar with explicit fan art, which is often made by/for a reeeeally cheap commission and is therefore the content desired by the buyer. Again, yep, they made it and yeah they put it out there. But chances are, they didn't want that shit winding up in Misha Collins' hands at Comic-Con or some shit.\n\nSorry, it's just sad to me, only ever seeing fanfiction boiled down to: creepy fetishizing straight teen girls with no sense of propriety or decency or boundaries, who would love to stalk and horrify their \"OTP\" with their works. Again, because of people like OP's girlfriend. Loud fetishizing no-boundary-having folks who would and should be judged, even by most on AO3 or Tumblr.\n\nFanfiction can be *brilliant*. It can be bizarre. It's just damn unfortunate that we never hear about the first option, just the latter.\n\nIt's worth examining as well, the gender aspect not only in the Straight Person Writing/Creating Gay Erotica and how we view straight men directing lesbian pornography vs straight women writing explicit gay fanfiction but also in the \"do we view this differently as a society because fanfiction is overwhelmingly female-driven and therefore more likely to be viewed negatively.\"\n\nUgh, still horrified as SHIT about this post though.", "I'm a guy, and i write a bit of Yaoi (boy / boy snut) ((not fanfic)) and i read some too....

Like the idiot things they understand DID even tho the character is either too young or doesn't display appropriate symptoms or the therapist isn't doing anything.\n\nThere a handful of really sweet sometimes but steamy yaoi by women that are very fucking sweet and don't fetishising gay men.\n\n\nI remember one, rather popular, yaoi comic where the leads were gay... But the marry sue would watch and get turned on and was joining in at moments. Very fucking weird.", "She wanted him to find this. I am sure. Someone else wrote that OP is probably asian too and theres a fetish going on", "DID is the worst offender for romanticized mental illnesses. I blame tiktok \u201csystems\u201d and that multiplicity and me on YouTube. I got diagnosed this year and tbh, it\u2019s not so much I\u2019m mad or whatever, I just feel like the social and mass media representation of DID contributes to this subtle undercurrent of the people around me thinking I\u2019m dangerous. \n\nAlso this reminds me of the FNAF creator writing that CANON story that involved MatPat getting Mpreg from an animatronic and how UNCOMFORTABLE it made him to know about. \n\nNTA op your gf is being creepy and selfish.", "I wasn\u2019t very clear but when I said \u2018nod *as though* pointing someone out\u2019 I meant don\u2019t actually single out some innocent stranger.", "I've seen did fakers before tictok.\n\nI've once had a girl protend to be a guy to get me to send nudes."]}
