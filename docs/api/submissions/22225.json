He became embarrassed and then redirected his inability to accept and regulate that onto you. NTA.", "NTA\n\nGeee, just remembered he could pay with his phone?  Wow\n\nHe was the AH For expecting anyone else to cover him.  He showed himself to be a megaAH for then berating you about it. \n\nGood for you for bringing cash and standing up for yourself.", "NTA. This is my kind of petty :-) You said initially \"someone forgets their wallet.\" Then at the end your friend approached you outside to complain. Sounds like 'friend' was specifically targeting you. Is this a repeat behavior with said 'friend?' If so, we found the AH.", "NTA\n\nYour friend is expecting you to be his personal ATM, he is embarrassing himself.", "NTA\n\nYou are not your friend's bank.\n\nAlso I have been out with my friend group for around 15 years, not once did anyone claim they didn't bring a way to pay. If you go out, at some point it is likely you have to pay something. \"Routinely\"forgetting to bring means of payment is really inconsiderate and disrespectful towards the friend you went out with.\n\nAnd yes, once or twice I could overlook but after that I'd feel quite a bit disrespected.", "NTA. This person is trying use you as his personal interest free line of credit.\n\nYou didn't embarrasse him... He did that to himself", "LOL wait, what? YOU made HIM look cheap because you couldn\u2019t spot him for the meal? GTFOH with that, your friend must\u2019ve been smoking some good shit. NTA and find some friends who aren\u2019t cheapskates. Who just \u201cforgets\u201d their wallet when going out to eat?", "INFO: Who are all these people who regularly forget their wallets?", "Last I checked, friends are not required to pay for each other's meals. This person has been allowed to skate on this in the past and took weeks to pay you back. You owe him nothing. If he can't afford to eat out, he should refrain from going with you. If he's embarrassed, it's his problem.", "NTA, and I would continue to do this until Mr Moocher remembers he's responsible for paying for himself.", "Lol busted\ud83d\ude02", "Oh, yeah just remembered, sure.\n\nNTA", "NTA if asking you for money while knowing full well he can just pay from his phone instead of shmoozing off you was going to be such an embarrassing thing for him then why'd he do it?", "NTA. You are not responsible for their bill.", "NTA lol this was brilliant!", "NTA. He IS cheap. There have been times where I ask a friend if they want to grab food, they say they are tight on money, and I covered them (keep in mind we're talking buying Jack in the Box in college and stuff like that). But it was NEVER an expectation", "You embarrassed him by letting himself make it abundantly clear that he *is* cheap. NTA", "NTA\n\nHe keeps doing this? It\u2019s intentional. For whatever reason, especially since he apparently does pay you back?\n\nEither way, don\u2019t lend this person any more money. He made himself look cheap.\n\nAlso blows my mind that in a group of adults someone *regularly* forgets their wallet. Y\u2019all need to grow the hell up if it\u2019s frequent and more than one person", "Well played. The only people I've ever known who habitually forget their wallets are either cheapskates or were trying to hide the fact that they don't have enough money at the time.  It's never an honest circumstance. NTA.  You mind as well start bringing cash more often.", "Absolutely not.", "NTA. He wasn't asking if you would pay. He had a very unreasonable expectation that you would pay before he even got there and got upset when you didn't/ couldn't. And the fact that he paid for it himself after you said no would be very concerning to me. He had the money. He just wanted you to pay anyway.", "NTA.  Person was being cheap.  was he hoping that you would forget if you paid for him?", "NTA. Your solution was elegant.", "NTA, getting people to pay you back is annoying and if this could pay with his phone this whole time, then he was making excuses to not pay.", "NTA\n\nHe embarrassed himself. \n\nI literally had to start doing this (bringing cash) when my ex husband and I were first separated and then divorcing if we had had dinner together with our kids (birthdays, holidays, etc). I learned my lesson when we had dinner together with our 2 youngest after our middle child returned from being out of the country for a year. The poor waiter brought our check, and I was figuring out what my ex and I owed (he didn\u2019t touch the check). My ex pretended there wasn\u2019t a check. The restaurant was busy and needed to turn our table, so I paid the entire bill. \n\nThe next morning, my ex was driving back home with our youngest (I was staying with our son to visit longer). We all met for breakfast before they got on the road. I told our waitress that my ex would be on his own check (I got there first without kids since ex doesn\u2019t know how to tell time). My check came, and his food was on my check. I protested to the manager (not done at the table nor in front of my kids). Basically, my ex told (when I went to the bathroom) the poor waitress that it should be on one check. She assumed he\u2019d pay it. \n\nMy bill was immediately fixed, and the look on my ex\u2019s face was priceless. Ever since that weekend 8 or 9 years ago, I always have cash with me that covers my food and 50% of my kids\u2019 meals. My ex has learned.", "Anybody who goes to dinner in a restaurant and doesn't bring either cash or a debit/credit card? A. They are an asshole and B. They should not be surprised if they never get invited anywhere", "He embarrassed himself by being a mooch. NTA", "NTA. I'm sincerely curious how your actions supposedly made him look cheap? He made himself look cheap. But on the plus side now you know he can pay with his phone! Unless he forgets that too and I bet he will. Just bring cash from now on.", "That person has issues", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. He is cheap.", "NTA he is cheap and had the means to pay. Which shows every other time you\u2019ve covered them they were just being difficult for no reason.", "NTA. Money can be exchanged for goods and services. Lmao.", "Interesting take from the friend still trying to deflect responsibility. OP is NTA.", "NTA \nI am not sure I would consider a friend, a person who uses me for their convenience and chides me when I am not available to be used because they don't like the way they look when bared from  using me.\nThat is some sense of entitlement.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
