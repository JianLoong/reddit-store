My check came, and his food was on my check. I protested to the manager (not done at the table nor in front of my kids).

If you behave responsibly, the power of a bank is much more likely to work for you than against you.", "Actually, no.  There are an amazing number of \"unbanked\" and \"Under-banked\" people.   People who don't, for one reason or another, have a bank account at a bank, S&L or CU.    \n\nIn the 1960s and earlier, they might have done their \"banking\" at the USPS.  The USPS used to do some very basic banking services, before the government spun them off into being a pseudo-corporate entity rather than an actual division of the government.  \n\nThese days, many of them are now paid on a bank issued payment card for their paycheck, but not all of them.  There are still small businesses who literally hand write out paychecks once a week.    Even the unbanked who get a paycheck card often go draw it all out when they get paid, and pay for everything in cash.  It is the only way to keep from over-spending for many of them.  The reason many of them do not have bank accounts is because they had one, and over-drew it too many times, and the banking network will no longer allow them to have an account without paying their debt.", "It's a small plate type of cuisine, it can be extremely cheap or extremely expensive or anywhere between depending on the diner's appetite and self discipline. I don't think location has as much to do with it tbh.", "I never understood this idea that separate checks is \u201cdifficult\u201d, is this a US thing? Here, the server asks whether the bill will be together or separate at the end of the meal, every time.", "I\u2019m glad it works out for you, credit cards are another thing for me, I\u2019ve seen people get into major debt because of a bad circumstance and they are a tool that can be used for both good and bad things. I don\u2019t use them because if anything were to happen to me I wouldn\u2019t want debt hanging over my head until I was able to start making money again. Without a credit card I live 100% within my means and I don\u2019t owe anybody anything. Also keeping track of money spent is a lot easier and when you are handing over physical cash rather than tapping your card or phone. There is no such thing as \u201cfree\u201d in this world.", "... prime rib is so expensive *by itself* and he added LOBSTER\u203d\n\nGood lord", "There is no debt hanging over your head if you pay it off in full each month.  \nKeeping track of money spent isn't any different, my app shows what I've spent. I don't have to count my cash.  \n\nIf you live somewhere that has credit card fees built into the marked price for goods, unless vendors are giving you a cash discount you could be paying 2-4% more for items without enjoying any of the credit card rewards that comes with that fee. Nothing is free, but you're likely paying the cc fee without anything to show for it. You're giving away money to corporations.", "Which state is this?!", "So basically you\u2019re telling me IF I pay off the card I won\u2019t get charged interest? What happens if I break my hand and I can\u2019t earn money for 2 months? I know what I have cash wise because I count my money every Friday and I keep it tallied on my notes in my phone for savings etc. In America sure I understand the credit card gouging prices because the USA mindset is debt debt debt, but here in the uk at least where I live, competition in goods and services is so high that businesses regulate their own prices fairly well to remain competitive. Even if I pay some hidden 1-5% increased fee I\u2019m still happy to do that because I\u2019m still living within my means and I would still pay that even if I paid with a credit card and I physically cannot spend the pound notes I don\u2019t physically posses.", "You have money to pay off your cc. If you don't, and you break your hand and can't earn money for 2 months, how is that any different?  \nYou don't like banks but you're happy to pay a 1-5% hidden fee with nothing to show for it... \nIt sounds like you can't be helped, you keep making excuses to give away money.", "NTA\n\nBut why did you lie about forgetting a wallet? Could have just said, \"I'm only using cash today.\"", "NTA\n\nHow convenient that he remembered he could actually pay. \n\nThis guy is clearly trying to use you like a no interest payday money loan to extend his own funds, since he wasn't interested in getting help from someone who wanted to be paid back immediately. It's also pretty telling that he was upset *at you* for not having money, and not, say, the person who offered to pay for him but wanted to immediately be paid back. Not that he should have, I just think it's funny he's blaming you for not having money. He looks cheap, because he is cheap, and he knows it. This guy ain't your friend.", "idk lol", "NTA. How entitled of them,I can\u2019t stand people like that. \n\nI did something similar to a guy in college and he never forgot his wallet again or at least not around me.", "NTA.  You called out the mooch in the best way possible.  They got upset because the only other person willing to pay for them wanted to be reimbursed immediately, and they were used to sponging off you and dragging their feet in repaying.", "This story doesn't add up and sounds made up.", "Nope, he embarrassed himself by making himself look cheap and just down right silly.\n\nNTA.  At all.  Maybe for awhile make sure you have cash for you only.", "He made himself look cheap. Next time separate checks.  Oh you are NTA by the way", "[removed]", "But he will gladly pay you Tuesday, for a hamburger today!", "He\u2019s probably also the type of person who owes $10.65 for his meal, but only pays $10.", "I let my brother order doordash from my phone the other day. Let him select what he wanted on my phone. It was like 25 bucks. I finished the order and tipped like I  usually do and paid for priority. Total was like 40 bucks. He gave me 25 bucks cash to cover it.", "So you drove up the cost and expected him to front the bill for those extras?", "If you order the most expensive item on the menu and then want to split the bill evenly we have a problem and that problem is you. The audacity of some people is just crazy!", "Exactly.  THere are an amazing number of Americans who live in poverty who are unbanked or underbanked.  They depend on cashing their checks at their local supermarket, walmart or check-cashing store.  They pay a pretty penny to do so in many cases.  It is expensive to be unbanked.", "The brother should at least cover the door dash fees, if thatnwasnt part of the $25, and should expect to add tip too. \n\nOtherwise yeah, I agree with you, can't jack up the price with options that the person ordering didn't ask for.", "There is nothing wrong with \u201csplit evenly\u201d as long as you don\u2019t dine with assholes. I loathe the pettiness of having group members contribute \u201ctheir share\u201d and ending up with not enough for the bill, let alone a tip.  This resulted in multiple rounds of \u201cwe need more money\u201d and the generous folks end up giving even more.\n\nNow I eat with people where we take turns paying and I\u2019m not taken advantage of because I don\u2019t eat with assholes (at least not twice).  \n\nIn modern times it\u2019s easier to split checks so that\u2019s a reasonable option, but I still don\u2019t want to dine with people who would try to take advantage.  Just cut them from your life, or at least from your social events which have bills.", "I do not pay for anything until after I am provided with services that are to a satisfactory standard, I very rarely order online because I live within 10 miles of 2 different city centres and 1 has the biggest shopping centre in the country. These reversed charges problems are only a problem to me if I was to use a bank card to pay for things, without a bank card I can still receive a receipt of goods and services and warranty\u2019s and if it\u2019s not a big company I still wouldn\u2019t pay till I receive work or goods to the standard agreed upon. I work with my hands and I deal in cash and if someone didn\u2019t pay me for work I did I would take them to court and collect payments with interest. Sure it may take a little longer but I also would receive interest on payments owed to me. Banks don\u2019t hold your money for your own benefit. They want your money to make their money and I\u2019m not being a pawn, I bought a car when I was 22 and the bank refused to let me spend \u00a312,000 unless I could prove where it come from and after the hassle of resolving that with the hassle of proving my income with tax returns I decided to just live without that hassle and having someone tell me how the fuck I spend my own money", "\u201cBehave responsibly\u201d with my own money? That\u2019s my problem. I\u2019m not trying to change anyone\u2019s mind, if you\u2019re okay with using banks and you prefer the convenience that\u2019s okay but I enjoy the freedom to spend money on what I please and not have it digitally tracked and line the pockets of some wa-banker.", "This is certainly your choice, but I can\u2019t imagine giving up all that participating in the modern financial world has gotten me. Banks are currently paying 5% interest, and I get 1-5% back on all my credit card purchases. I am earning over $500 a month just for having my money in a bank. I earn thousands a year from my credit card cash back. I have never paid a penny of interest on a credit card, not a penny in annual fees for either my bank account nor my credit card.\n\nI understand how people can get screwed by banks and credit cards, but it sounds like you are very financially disciplined already\u2026 if you are financially disciplined, banking is only a positive.", "I am probably too far financially strict on myself but I don\u2019t believe in debt being a good thing, debt is modern day slavery and in almost every religion; usury is frowned upon apart from the Jewish people. Most people in the modern western world are 1-2 pay checks in debt as it is. The 5% interest you talk about is nothing with inflation hitting anywhere from 12-40% in most of the western world. I do have a bank account because there are some things you absolutely cannot do without a bank account but I literally use it for a very rare occasion where I put the money in at a post office and within minutes the money has gone to where it needs to go. You can make a lot better than 5% if you buy and sell goods or investments like jewellery for example if you are willing to spend a few months looking into it. If the bank is giving me 5% they\u2019re making more than 5%. Again I believe in live and let live but people seem to struggle to understand how and why banks operate and the many negatives that banks bring to the world. If you\u2019re paying extortionate prices on rent/mortgages that\u2019s because of banks. The very reason the world is in a massive inflation curve at the moment is because the banks were going crazy printing money out of thin air in 2019. Banks aren\u2019t your friend and they exist to use your money to make themselves rich and that is all they are there to do, they can and do control how you spend your money, they can and do raise the prices of everything because of bankers pulling the world off the gold standard and on to the fractional reserve system we have now leading to the crazy inflation we have now which has arguably made the world poorer than it\u2019s been since the Industrial Revolution on a wage/purchasing power level.", "NSW are the ones pushing hard with the digital ID. I'm in VIC and they are supportive of it but haven't released it here yet, personally would not like that at all.", "If I dont, I use my savings I\u2019ve accumulated and cut back on spending because I see the physical currency dwindling away and it\u2019s been proven that people\u2019s phycology is more conservative with hard currency. Competition regulates business prices rising and if a company is more expensive round here they will lose my custom it\u2019s that simple and that is why all 12 fuel stations near me are selling diesel for 1.40 and petrol for 1.37. Credit card fees aren\u2019t built into the prices because even if I was using a card guess what? I\u2019d still be paying those prices! Cash is king because it\u2019s untraceable and receipts are always going to be receipts for goods not delivered. You think credit card companies give you these bonuses because they\u2019re nice and give away free stuff? You\u2019re delusional and if you feel mighty with your plastic shackle then more power to you my friend", "This is a smart move!\n\nI also had to resort to similar tactics with someone who never chipped in gas.

You need to do a better job of disclosing fee's and tips. \n\nA better option is before you hit order you ask them \"Hey, your share after fees and tip is going to be $30, you still want to order?\" \n\nThat tells them exactly what you expect to receive and gives them a chance to change their order if they don't have the money.
