Personally I think she should just stop doing anything meal related for him every day, not just the 3 or so days a week she's looking for him to do it. She's stated she doesn't want to (with valid reasons), and he's an adult who apparently cooked prior to OP's surgery.", "Apparently? The post literally says she asked him and that he shut it down on the basis of he \"doesn't like to rush to get it ready\". So she then did the prep as a compromise which is reasonable enough because if someone says it's the rushing to prep that's the problem then taking that off their hands is hardly a jump to unreasonable. It's unclear from the post alone whether this was discussed prior to her doing it but you're really going to focus on her only doing half the cooking for one night..after months of being the sole cook when it was previously a shared responsibility.. because she potentially didn't inform him first, Over him literally going from sharing the responsibility to expecting it all to be done for him because she's at home already? (Again, on MEDICAL LEAVE)\nI agree if she didn't inform him beforehand then it's not a positive way to go about it but seriously dude, You're reaching with calling her toxic for doing half the chore that she's been doing single handedly whilst recovering from surgery for months.", "Sounds like you guys should start a subreddit, r/blendedfoods maybe?", "Do you have Fairlife brand Core Power shakes where you live? They usually sell them in the supplement/protein powder section on the shelf... But they're bottled drinks. I get the one that's 46 g of protein and it tastes like a milkshake! As somebody that's been going to the gym and drink protein shakes for 30 years, I promise you these will be the best ones you ever have!", "My husband adores Adkins plus. It has the protein and calories he needs.  Try that flavor maybe.  Best of luck.  Nta  but husband is.", "If you can stand almond or soy milk I cut my chocolate ensure with those and its a lot less cloying!", "I had gastric bypass,  had to live on protein shakes for a while. Found an online store that stocked ALL the torani, davinci, etc. syrups. Ordered a case of sugar free, loved my coconut chocolate, cherry chocolate, orange chocolate, chocolate mint, etc. etc.", "I was having to drink those just to get some amount of food in during a different medical issue and like. Sure, they're not the *worst* but only that for this long would be *miserable*.\n\nHonestly, I feel like it might be worth it to say \"either you cook your own food or you eat what I'm eating\" for a stretch.", "I actually quite like the Vega brand coconut shake. It's still... chalky, like any shake, but it's got a great flavour.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry, Ensure (or anything similar) is nasty shit. My oncologist wanted me to drink Ensure when I was on chemo. I laughed and said no \ud83d\ude02 \n\nMy friends use them in a milkshakes and Ensure-sicles.", "Just wanted to add I buy soylent ready made drinks and they all taste really good.", "Core Power by Fair Life and Premier Protein both have better tasting flavors. \n\nCore power has a 42g protein version that tastes a little thin, but the 26g ones are my absolute favorite as a lifter. \n\nYou can also look up protein shake recipes on tiktok, using sugar free jello and pudding has been revolutionary to the flavor options.", "Try looking for Premier Protein.  My mom started drinking it during her cancer treatment.  Comes in a bunch of flavors.  I think she gets hers at Walmart.", "Try the Fairlife protein chocolate. It\u2019s by far my favorite and doesn\u2019t even taste like you\u2019re drinking something \u201chealthy\u201d.", "Have you tried core power from fair life? Pretty high protein contents. Huel is a good option too (blend, don't shake, the texture is better) and they have savory options as well. It's called a complete meal so has carbs etc, not just protein.", "There are other protein meal replacement options that are much better then ensure.", "You think OP would be mentioning it if it was a 20-30 minute jaunt to the supermarket? That's just a normal errand.", "You people have a very different understanding of the word compromise than me.\n\nCompromising isn't telling someone what they will start doing.\n\nBut it's obvious we disagree, you have your vote, I have mine.  I encourage and support your right to vote however you want.", "We have very different interpretations of the word compromise.  I think of a compromise as something both parties agree to.\n\nYou seem to be confusing her legitimate issue with cooking and her approach to resolving that.  Her approach is what made her the AH, not the fact that her situation is what it is.\n\nIf I asked you to where a thong and you said no, then you came home and I replaced all your underwear with cheeky panties and said 'I decided we'd compromise' is that what a compromise is to you?", "I'll look!  Thank you!!  I haven't heard of it, but will check around because that sounds like a fabulous amount of protein!", "Yeah and for people who live next to the border that\u2019s an errand lol, the annoying part is the customs stuff, that\u2019s the unknown, but yes, for many Canadians, it would legit be a 20-30 minute jaunt at the best of times even with customs.", "Dude. She did talk to him. She tried to get him to compromise. She never \"told him what he'd start doing\", she asked him for help, then when her desire to let him fend for himself came in, she STILL provided assistance by prepping all the ingredients. \n\nIt feels like you are saying she should just keep doing it because he won't. Because anything less than her doing it 100% of the time is \"toxic\". She is not required to cook him meals EVER. She is doing a lot already while still financially providing for the household. She's not even asking him to cook for himself every night! Literally 3ish nights of the week.\n\nWe can have different votes, but you keep focusing on this 1 thing, and it's not even valid.", "I literally said in my comment that I do not agree with the move if it wasn't discussed beforehand. \n\nI'm sorry.. you're equating having a preference in what underwear your partner wears for your own gratification and then forcing them to wear only that by getting rid of all other options.. to her doing half the cooking that is a literal human necessity for them both in order for him to actually do the other half for the first time in months even when she'd communicated that she was in distress and he dismissed her? I've seen some extreme false equivalences on this site but that takes the cake. Wanting your partner to take back some of the necessary, adult responsibility they've decided to dump entirely on you for unjustifiable reasons is not the same as wanting your partner to gratify your sexual preferences and the fact you've confused the two is concerning.", "You definitely have to try them, they are so good! They have two different versions one has like 26 g of protein the other has like 46. The vanilla is the absolute best, followed by chocolate and then the strawberries. You can drink them warm, but they're definitely better if you put them in the fridge first.", "You've probably gotten a lot of suggestions, but I had jaw surgery back in September. When my mouth was no longer wired shut, I still was not allowed to chew food. If that is the case for you as well, I highly recommend making different kinds of dips. The dips I made included buffalo chicken, tuna, taco, and lasagna. I made sure the meat was ground ir shredded so I didn't have to chew, and took small bites to make sure I didn't choke. They were heaven compared to the liquid only diet I was forced to consume for a few weeks (I also survived on Ensure). \n\nBest of luck with the recovery, and definetly NTA", "I'm with the other suggestions that everyone can have soup, at least a few nights a week.\n\nThere are some soups that actually suggest blending to a puree with chunks, like potato soup, where that texture is exactly what everyone expects from the soup. I'd suggest things like that, and your portion can just go in the blender a bit longer. Also get store bought bread and pre made garlic butter - bread that's nicer than plain sandwich bread if you feel like being nice. Hubby can toast some bread and butter it if he wants a bit more with his soup. Either way, at least 2 dinners a week you should not be slaving away with smells you can't eat.\n\nIf that's not enough for him, he can help. Possible compromise being that you might make soups that go really well with grilled cheese and other sandwiches, and prep the stuff for that. He can stand and make/heat his sandwich. You might, if you feel nice, come up with sandwich ideas if you feel like his reluctance to help is an issue of not having the habit of figuring out what's for dinner and how to season it.\n\nI like grilled cheese and chicken noodle soup. I've also had turkey and cream cheese sandwiches (not grilled) dipped in lentil soup. If the soup is nice and hot, the cream cheese melts into it. If you go with the cream cheese sandwich idea, you could dollop some seasoned cream cheese into your portion of the soup.\n\nTwo nights a week would be a nice start to getting some respect, if you don't feel like cutting him off completely. His choices are cooperating or he can come home to literally nothing while you sip ensure. If he truly cannot handle that *two nights a week* then he needs to cough up some cash and buy dinner.\n\nEdited to add\n\nForgot to mention. I have some jaw issues myself, though not severe (yet). If you Google \"broken jaw panic button\" someone made a blog post specifically with that sentence for search engine reasons. They were keeping an online food journal after breaking their jaw from hypoglycemic passing out - family was panicked that they'd pass out more because they couldn't eat well while wired shut. That journal has some good ideas and some bad ideas but mostly is a decent listing of what they tried and how it worked out.", "This might be a silly suggestion, but have you considered adding popping or tapioca boba to your smoothies?", "Thank you!  I'll have a look.  I'm in Canada, and haven't seen that here, but we're only a few hours from the border.", "Those all sound delicious!  I am definitely looking forward to losing the wires and enjoying some of those things!"]}
