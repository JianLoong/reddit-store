And get your husband to take you for a slap up meal when you are better.", "Hey OP - I don\u2019t know what all you\u2019ve tried yet, but I used to cook and blend food in a group home for individuals who couldn\u2019t chew their own food. I LOVE to cook and found the food they were eating before nasty, plain, and abhorrent, so I found ways to make the food delicious, and some of our residents noticeably gained some needed weight after I joined on. I can\u2019t solve the texture issue unfortunately, but if you\u2019d like, I\u2019d be happy to offer some suggestions to make blended food more palatable?", "Order in a few times a week.", "I think that there are better ways to negotiate than just the one way they have considered. Yes she is recovering from surgery however, he is still working full time it sounds like. I think everybody is so quick to pass blame instead of some things are easier to just compromise and communicate. If it remains a problem and husband isn't willing to compromise or communicate than it becomes a problem.", "Depends how near the border they live. I cross a border for my commute to work.", "Just the chocolate kind or chocolate Boost with extra protein.  Those are the only two I can stomach.  It's not great, but manageable anyway.", "Just curious, do you make yourself smoothies with a lot of fruits, vegetables and protein/fiber (like nut butter, cooked oats, yogurt, etc)? You might feel more full and satiated rather than primarily drinking Ensure. How much longer do you need you have your jaw wired? I'm so sorry you're experiencing this.\n\nAnd obviously NTA for the cooking. Honestly, you should only be responsible for cooking for your child, your husband is a grown man and he is capable of cooking for himself. I get that it's less convenient for him to come home from work and make dinner, but guess who has to do that? Most goddamn adults, on a daily basis.", "If you like coffee I suggest adding the ensure/protein shake to that! Makes it much more tolerable. I also add a splash of creamer if I\u2019m feeling fancy.", "My jaw will be wired for at least another month...we'll see after that.  Hopefully that will be it.  \ud83e\udd1e\n\nI was drinking a lot of smoothies, but stopped because I got bored with the texture.  I should definitely start making them again though...thanks for the reminder!", "Get him some Hungry Man freezer dinners. They only take a couple minutes to heat and then he can't complain about the time dinner takes to cook. I have recently diagnosed food allergies to all of my favorite foods. Going to the grocery store is torture, because everything is a reminder of something I love and can't have anymore. My husband is consistently sympathetic and thoughtful and would never ask me to make my old favorites and then sit there and watch him eat them. Your hubby is being massively inconsiderate. NTA, and sending good wishes for your recovery.", "Just stopping by to ask whether you're aware of and have tried the non-milk based supplements...? Boost Breeze is one brand, but I'm sure there's an equivalent from other brands. They're more like juice or punch, and a lot of my patients like them better.\n\nWishing you a speedy recovery! NTA", "You can also use ensure in milkshakes. I do that at work for patients. Nta"]}
