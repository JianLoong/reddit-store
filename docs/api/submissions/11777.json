I cook whole packages of bacon on wire cookie racks with foil under them at 350 in the oven.  BLT's for dinner.   Add bagged salad with any of these and you have dinner.

If husband had done some cooking before, it's not like you are asking him to do something more than he had done in the past. If cooking dinner is a generally new task for him, I can understand how he would find it a challenge to get used to doing after a day at work. But he could still easily pick up Sat and Sun evenings.

I'd suggest things like that, and your portion can just go in the blender a bit longer. Also get store bought bread and pre made garlic butter - bread that's nicer than plain sandwich bread if you feel like being nice. Hubby can toast some bread and butter it if he wants a bit more with his soup. Either way, at least 2 dinners a week you should not be slaving away with smells you can't eat.\n\nIf that's not enough for him, he can help. Possible compromise being that you might make soups that go really well with grilled cheese and other sandwiches, and prep the stuff for that. He can stand and make/heat his sandwich. You might, if you feel nice, come up with sandwich ideas if you feel like his reluctance to help is an issue of not having the habit of figuring out what's for dinner and how to season it.\n\nI like grilled cheese and chicken noodle soup. I've also had turkey and cream cheese sandwiches (not grilled) dipped in lentil soup. If the soup is nice and hot, the cream cheese melts into it. If you go with the cream cheese sandwich idea, you could dollop some seasoned cream cheese into your portion of the soup.\n\nTwo nights a week would be a nice start to getting some respect, if you don't feel like cutting him off completely.

She objects because she can't eat solid food and is upset she cannot eat solid food when she cooks but thinks she would have less of a problem if husband cooked some nights.\n\n  \n OP's surgery may have been an elective surgery to wire her jaw shut because she does not mention a traumatic fracture.  An elective jaw wiring surgery involves intentionally breaking the jawbone bilaterally and readjusting \\[either by lengthening or shortening\\] the lower jaw bone to achieve either a cosmetic effect \\[altering the appearance of the face or to achieve a change in food intake to reduce weight\\] or a functional effect \\[improve jaw joint function\\]. Shortening the mandible \\[lower jawbone\\] involves cutting out some of the mandible before wiring.  Any traumatic injury sufficient to cause a jaw fracture might involve other bodily injuries yet none are mentioned by OP.  If it is an elective surgery, OP knew what was coming and scheduled time off work to have the surgery.  If it is the latter, she did not make that decision.  While it may be aggravating not to be able to eat solid food, it sounds like OP decided to do that.  If it was for weight reduction, OP's intolerance of food preparation may be related to a disordered relationship with food.  If it was for changing her facial appearance, she decided in advance be to tolerate this cost for her cosmetic goal.  If it was for trauma or weight reduction, OP may need therapy to deal with the trauma/disordered eating.  Whether or not OP is the AH depends on the reason for the surgery and whether or not she is getting therapy to deal with the initial trauma and her intolerance of cooking.  \n\nINFO:  What was the reason for the surgery?  Was OP's husband involved in any decision OP made to have an elective surgery involving jaw wiring?  Does OP do more work around the house while off work?  How recent was surgery?  Was OP employed outside the house full time before the surgery?  Who did the cooking for the evening meal before the surgery?

Longer answer: it was a complicated situation. \n\nFull answer, if you\u2019re interested: When we got together we were both disabled. Me, recently; he had lifelong issues.\n\nOver time, my body began to break down. We learned that I was immune impaired and had latent TB. We found out my spinal injury was the beginning of my hips and other joints breaking down. We learned that I had a genetic disease that put me at high risk for certain cancers.\n\nI had adult onset diabetes. [Type 1.5 LADA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_autoimmune_diabetes_in_adults) (Basically my pancreas died and I was in a three day coma and almost died). I had a nine pound ovarian tumor. I was in and out of the hospital with surgeries constantly.\n\nWe were together for 15 years. He was a novelist and journalist. I had to give up my career as a hotel pastry chef (due to disability) and find a new career as a banker. His income was sporadic; mine was what paid the bills, covered insurance, etc.\n\nHe was also 22 years older than me. Over time, due to his age,, he became more and more impaired: DMT2, sleep apnea, Bipolar 2 (news to him, not me lol), mobility issues, depressive disorder.\n\nI was the breadwinner, the housekeeper, the planner, the bill payer, the keeper of all things medical. I worked as much as I was physically able and my job accommodated me. I also did rescue, foster, and hospice for pets, so I constantly had a houseful of sick and/or dying animals.\n\nSo, yeah that\u2019s a lot. If you\u2019re still with me, thank you.\n\nThere came a time when I became too disabled to work. And needed some help. I had become significantly more disabled physically and needed care and support he couldn\u2019t give me. We loved each other but we couldn\u2019t live together.\n\nHe refused to see, understand, or accept my limitations. And I was no longer able to manage a lot of the tasks I listed above. He did not support me, step in, work to find other solutions, etc. He became constantly angry at me, and resentful. He demeaned me openly, vocally, and often in public. \n\nMy mother came to visit, took in the situation, and said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t get out of here you\u2019re going to die.\u201d And she was right. She moved from Texas to my home state so I had a place to live and someone who could help me with the things I could no longer do. And she saved my life.\n\nSo I could have said \u201clife is complicated.\u201d But now you\u2019ve got the whole story or, at least, a good part of it.
