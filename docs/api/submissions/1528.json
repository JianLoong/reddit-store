My husband (M31) took some time off work when the baby was born, but has since gone back, so it is just the babies in the house day-to-day. Safe to say, I am not particularly well-rested at the moment, and the house is a bit chaotic.\n\nToday being Saturday, my husband said that he would help me catch up on some of the chores while I got some rest. I was really grateful, it has been a tough week. Unfortunately, some kids in the neighbourhood must have taken advantage of the good weather and thought to play ding-dong-dash.  \n\nThe first incident was funny, the second time was mildly irritating, but I was downright frustrated by the sixth time. The baby and the toddler were both woken/disturbed each time, and I didn't get any of the rest that I was so looking forward to. I decided that I would help my husband with chores seeing as I was up anyway.\n\nThe seventh ding-dong-dash just so happened to be when I was vaccumming the hallway, so I got to the door before the kids were gone. There were two young boys, I would say six or seven, and they got a massive shock when I opened the door.\n\nTo be clear, I was firm but I was by no means shouting or hostile. I asked them what they thought was funny about disturbing my family, and one of them responded that I was not their mom. I said back, \"I am not, but I don't think she would want to be disturbed either.\" After that, they turned and ran away. It was a very brief interaction.\n\nLater, a man identifying himself as the boys' dad knocked on the door and said I made the boys cry. He said that it was children being children, they weren't hurting anyone, and my comment about their mom being disturbed was uncalled for seeing as she had passed away. He said that I made them both cry all afternoon and they are afraid of playing in the neighbourhood anymore. He also said that he could not believe I \"lay in wait for them.\"\n\nI explained that I was sick and tired of the doorbell going off, but he said that I should just disarm it if some ringing disturbs my family that much. I feel like I am entitled to a doorbell, but that I shouldn't have to deal with constant ringing.", "created_utc": 1667643492, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ympzq8/aita_for_confronting_neighbourhood_dingdongdashers/", "score": 3244, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wtf? He needs to parent his kids and not let them run wild and crazy. Why would you disable YOUR doorbell so his kids can prank the house? What is his logic?", "NTA. Your house isn't a playground for the neighborhood children. His children just experienced what's called natural consequences.

NTA", "You were not, neither were the kids but I sure think their dad is one because he shows no empathy with his neighbors whatsoever and their traumatic family incident does not justify that you have put up with this.

Like you, I waited at the door - and they laughed their asses off at me. Turns out their culture \"doesn't respect women as authority\" as their mum put it when I walked them downstairs.
