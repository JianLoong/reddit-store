My husband (M31) took some time off work when the baby was born, but has since gone back, so it is just the babies in the house day-to-day. Safe to say, I am not particularly well-rested at the moment, and the house is a bit chaotic.\n\nToday being Saturday, my husband said that he would help me catch up on some of the chores while I got some rest. I was really grateful, it has been a tough week. Unfortunately, some kids in the neighbourhood must have taken advantage of the good weather and thought to play ding-dong-dash.  \n\nThe first incident was funny, the second time was mildly irritating, but I was downright frustrated by the sixth time. The baby and the toddler were both woken/disturbed each time, and I didn't get any of the rest that I was so looking forward to. I decided that I would help my husband with chores seeing as I was up anyway.\n\nThe seventh ding-dong-dash just so happened to be when I was vaccumming the hallway, so I got to the door before the kids were gone. There were two young boys, I would say six or seven, and they got a massive shock when I opened the door.\n\nTo be clear, I was firm but I was by no means shouting or hostile. I asked them what they thought was funny about disturbing my family, and one of them responded that I was not their mom. I said back, \"I am not, but I don't think she would want to be disturbed either.\" After that, they turned and ran away. It was a very brief interaction.\n\nLater, a man identifying himself as the boys' dad knocked on the door and said I made the boys cry. He said that it was children being children, they weren't hurting anyone, and my comment about their mom being disturbed was uncalled for seeing as she had passed away. He said that I made them both cry all afternoon and they are afraid of playing in the neighbourhood anymore. He also said that he could not believe I \"lay in wait for them.\"\n\nI explained that I was sick and tired of the doorbell going off, but he said that I should just disarm it if some ringing disturbs my family that much.

Wtf? He needs to parent his kids and not let them run wild and crazy. Why would you disable YOUR doorbell so his kids can prank the house? What is his logic?", "NTA. Your house isn't a playground for the neighborhood children. His children just experienced what's called natural consequences. If he doesn't want to parent his children other people will and often less kindly.\n\nAlso, boys being boys is a terrible excuse for letting your kids run wild.", "NTA\n\nWhat was that monster of a man going on about? His brat child and his brat friends were harassing you.

NTA", "You were not, neither were the kids but I sure think their dad is one because he shows no empathy with his neighbors whatsoever and their traumatic family incident does not justify that you have put up with this.

Where I'm from, kids who played this game would rather die before letting their parents find out that they were doing this. It's not funny the first time, nevermind the 7th (?!?!?).

Like you, I waited at the door - and they laughed their asses off at me. Turns out their culture \"doesn't respect women as authority\" as their mum put it when I walked them downstairs. She told me I needed to speak to her husband because they wouldn't listen to her either! 3 hours later when he got home I talked to him and he told me they could do what they wanted and they were kids having fun.

Asshole raising assholes.", "Also the kids mentioned their mom first!", "I work at a major retail store and one day some kids were running around, running up and down the escalator. My coworker very politely asked them to stop so they don't get hurt, but they continued. She finally figured out who the dad was and asked him to ask them to stop so they don't get hurt. The dad responded \"oh they're just athletes.\" The weirdest spin on boys will be boys.", "I agree with NTA, the only point I\u2019d add is that it may have been better to express her frustration and feelings without resorting to moral guilt tripping tactics by going all \u201cwhat would your mother say?\u201d on the kids.\n\nThat clearly made the situation worse, nothing wrong with telling the kids off though.", "I used to have a sign that said 'No solicitors, no missionaries,  no campaigners'. Some dude rang the bell to ask if we wanted him to remove the stump in the yard. I made him read the sign to me. Like, I pointed at it and asked him what it said, he tried to apologize and leave, and I was like, no, read it out loud, the same way I do with my students. He did, and then ran away, lol.", " had ding dongs ringing my doorbell like that once. Only once. I eventually lost my cherub like demeanour and hid behind the bushes. Sure enough, the ding dongs returned to ring my bell again.", "an OK game to play?  BS.  Unless of course you were ringing your own doorbell and running when your parents came to answer it.  But I bet your house was one of the certain houses.", "Or he could, yanno, use his words to explain why this behavior isn\u2019t okay rather than just hurting them and making them afraid?

NTA", "I don\u2019t think one is funny when you have a sleeping baby.", "I\u2019d be a girl being a girl and ring their doorbell to share in the \u201cfun\u201d.", "This is a very common tactic, because a lot of kids know how their parents react to things. Even parents use it on their own kids. \"What would dad think of you being awake right now?\" She's not rest and has sick kiddos. It's not a far-fetched behavior.", "We get the odd ding dong dasher but tends to be once a year around Halloween.", "Yes. They want attention I think and he is not giving his time to them.\nNTA", "It wasn\u2019t. Other kids did it at our house too. We were on friendly terms with all of our neighbors and it really wasn\u2019t an issue. It was not something that happened all the time and looking back I think the neighborhood was mostly happy this was the kind of mischief the neighborhood children were up to.", "Yes words work on American kids your correct \ud83d\udc4f", "I\u2019m imagining it\u2019s sticking the toothprick so the doorbell is pressed in and then break off the part that sticks out. Continuously ringing doorbell until they manage to wedge it out", "Basically you push the doorbell and stick the toothpick in the small gap around it and break it so it cannt be pulled out by hand. \n\nThat will make a lovely soundtrack to the poor soul who lives there. \n\nDone it a few times to a couple wankers.
