My husband (M31) took some time off work when the baby was born, but has since gone back, so it is just the babies in the house day-to-day. Safe to say, I am not particularly well-rested at the moment, and the house is a bit chaotic.\n\nToday being Saturday, my husband said that he would help me catch up on some of the chores while I got some rest. I was really grateful, it has been a tough week. Unfortunately, some kids in the neighbourhood must have taken advantage of the good weather and thought to play ding-dong-dash.  \n\nThe first incident was funny, the second time was mildly irritating, but I was downright frustrated by the sixth time. The baby and the toddler were both woken/disturbed each time, and I didn't get any of the rest that I was so looking forward to. I decided that I would help my husband with chores seeing as I was up anyway.\n\nThe seventh ding-dong-dash just so happened to be when I was vaccumming the hallway, so I got to the door before the kids were gone. There were two young boys, I would say six or seven, and they got a massive shock when I opened the door.\n\nTo be clear, I was firm but I was by no means shouting or hostile. I asked them what they thought was funny about disturbing my family, and one of them responded that I was not their mom. I said back, \"I am not, but I don't think she would want to be disturbed either.\" After that, they turned and ran away. It was a very brief interaction.\n\nLater, a man identifying himself as the boys' dad knocked on the door and said I made the boys cry. He said that it was children being children, they weren't hurting anyone, and my comment about their mom being disturbed was uncalled for seeing as she had passed away. He said that I made them both cry all afternoon and they are afraid of playing in the neighbourhood anymore. He also said that he could not believe I \"lay in wait for them.\"\n\nI explained that I was sick and tired of the doorbell going off, but he said that I should just disarm it if some ringing disturbs my family that much. I feel like I am entitled to a doorbell, but that I shouldn't have to deal with constant ringing.", "created_utc": 1667643492, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ympzq8/aita_for_confronting_neighbourhood_dingdongdashers/", "score": 142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were nicer than I would've been. I have a sign on my door that says DO NOT KNOCK and I wanted to rip the UPS guy in half when he knocked, made the dogs bark, and woke up my baby who I had finally gotten down and had only been asleep for 25 minutes. Fuck them kids.", "NTA\n\nMy petty ass would find out where he lives and each time his kids come ding dong dash, I'd go over there and ring his doorbell continuously. If he's so irritated with it, he should disarm his doorbell, right?", "NTA. You weren't 'laying in wait' it was the SEVENTH time the little monsters rang your doorbell in a short period of time and you were just doing a chore. How were you supposed to know their mom died? Wtf? He needs to parent his kids and not let them run wild and crazy. Why would you disable YOUR doorbell so his kids can prank the house? What is his logic?", "NTA. Your house isn't a playground for the neighborhood children. His children just experienced what's called natural consequences. If he doesn't want to parent his children other people will and often less kindly.\n\nAlso, boys being boys is a terrible excuse for letting your kids run wild.", "NTA\n\nWhat was that monster of a man going on about? His brat child and his brat friends were harassing you. They should never have started with this game and cannot continue doing. \n\nHe should be embarrassed and ashamed that he cannot manage his children. He\u2019s raising awful rotten little brats. Clearly that man is not playing with a full deck. He should have come round to apologize and asked the children to apologize as well. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, but there is nothing silly and cute about kids harassing neighbors. DDD is not \u201ckids being kids\u201d. It\u2019s rude, and disruptive. IDC that he\u2019s widowed and the kids have no mother. He\u2019s probably lying but if he\u2019s not, here\u2019s a sign that he needs to man up and be a parent. Those kids need help. Letting them run around the neighborhood terrorizing people is doing them no favors.", "NTA in any way.  The father is definitely an AH though.", "NTA. That person should have been supervising his kids more closely.", "Nta, I'm petty so I'd find their house and start getting people to do it to them 24/7.", "NTA. These kids need to learn what is acceptable and what is not.", "[removed]", "NTA. There's no excuse for this.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe their dad should try parenting instead of making excuses for his children harassing the neighbourhood. Try answering the door with a pail of dirty mop water next time.", "NTA \nBeing a kid doesn\u2019t excuse disturbing people, that dad needs to fix his parenting tactics or else\u2019s his children might end up in prison or with a beating from someone who isn\u2019t as nice.", "NTA. Kids often don\u2019t know how much their asshole behaviour impacts others, but targeting your house seven times is harassment. We get the odd ding dong dasher but tends to be once a year around Halloween. I\u2019d have been ready to feed them to lions in your situation. \n\nYou were beyond the usual tactic of just ignoring it at that point, and the kids dad was out of order.", "You are NTA. That dad is unreasonable. Okay, so the kids lost their mom but that doesn't give them a pass for being brats. I bet they've been brats for a long time and the dad just ignores it. You have every right to keep from being pestered like that. If it happens again, call the cops. You don't need to this harassment.", "NTA, you have more patience that I would have had.", "NTA. He\u2019s doing a piss poor job at parenting", "NTA. He can't just let his kids go around ringing doorbells.", "NTA. What would the Dad have done if the person was elderly and had a fright!", "NTA. But go ring the shit out of his doorbell if it\u2019s not that big of a deal to him", "NTA. 1 or 2 times, fair enough its just a joke. But 7 times is basically harrassment. The kids probably don't know that but the dad certainly should so he has no right to come arguing with you.", "The dad is an asshole.  What kind of stupid reasoning is that to justify his kid's behavior?  You can choose to lay in wait for anyone on your own property.  NTA", "You were not, neither were the kids but I sure think their dad is one because he shows no empathy with his neighbors whatsoever and their traumatic family incident does not justify that you have put up with this. Parenting is his job and the kids had the opportunity to  learn a lesson today that harassing neighbors is bad behavior. Unfortunately, their dad ruined that lesson by teaching them that they may do what they want without negative consequences.", "NTA. I wonder what the kids told him and how many times he thought they\u2019d rung the bell. Regardless, once was enough and he should either have left you in peace completely or just popped a note through the door apologising for their behaviour and promising it won\u2019t happen again", "NTA. This dude is letting his kids run around bothering people. They deserve to be reprimanded.", "NTA. The biggest AH here is the other dad (not your husband, OP) for condoning his sons' behavior.", "NTA. I'm with you- one is funny, 7 is infuriating. Their dad is entitled and apparently teaching the kids to be the same. It's your house, they were disturbing you, you didn't yell at them or hurt them. You did nothing wrong.", "\"yes, my kids are punching you in the face, but that's your fault for not moving your head out of the way. That's just what kids do\"\n\nNTA.", "Lol f that, he needs to parent his kids. What an asshole", "NTA", "NTA sure I've gone around ding dong dashing but it was once at a given house, watch for answer/reaction, then go to a house on the next block. That dad sounds like he doesn't know how to tell them that they're the problem", "NTA. He's not raising children, he's raising criminals.", "NTA. When I was young my parents explained to me it was an ok game to play but I was specifically told not to ring the bell at certain houses. Elderly, handicapped, sick plande people with young children were to be left alone. My mother explained why and to us it was very reasonable.", "Those kids need their ass whooped\nEdit so doess the dad for the bs excuse", "As a dad or two young children, he might not understand how difficult it is to be at home with a sick toddler and a newborn, but his wife surely does. If she\u2019s not an entitled parent I suggest you ask her to sit down and have a chat. These kids don\u2019t quite understand how difficult and annoying it can be to care for young kids And have two children playing  dingdong ditch interrupting your care, possibly waking the baby up and then having to deal with a cranky baby and toddler.\n\nThis man is just being disrespectful and defensive the next time this happens contact your HOA if you\u2019re feeling petty if not go talk to his partner. Because this dad sounds beyond selfish.\n\nNTA", "NTA lol once I was walking home with friends and a cop stopped us because we \u201cmatched the description\u201d of serial ding dong ditchers. She let us go since it was clearly not us but yeah you can call the cops about these things. I wouldn\u2019t say involving cops is the best choice but I lived in a small town where cops would turn up to give parents/kids a stern talk and then leave.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to do it once, it\u2019s another to harass a house. They\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t escalate.", "Nta\n\n> not hurting anyone\n\nThey are disrupting you and your baby's sleep, so yes they are hurting you.\n\nHe thinks the problem is the doorbell, when the real problem is that his kids are purposely being disruptive. If you disable the doorbell they can still do other annoying shit like knock on the door -- what does he expect you to do then, remove the door? \ud83d\ude02\n\nHe needs to take accountability and discipline his kids. The info about their mother is irrelevant-- regardless if she is alive or not, he should be teaching his kids not to play stupid pranks. Them being upset is the consequences of their own actions.", "NTA. It would become my mission in life to scare the absolute crap out of those little brats every time they dared to ring my doorbell again.", "NTA. They are being brats. I would put up no trespassing signs.", "NTA.  My son and his friend decided to ding dong ditch one day.  When I found out, I marched him out and made him apologize to every single house he had done it to.  He was mortified and has t done it since.  This father is a total asshole for using the death of the kids mother as an excuse for not properly supervising his kids.", "What?? Is there a parallel universe where this is an acceptable game? Where I'm from, kids who played this game would rather die before letting their parents find out that they were doing this. It's not funny the first time, nevermind the 7th (?!?!?). Bothering people, specially in their own home, it's simply not funny.\nNTA, at all.", "Nta,  I found out my kids were doing this, and it was a couple with the wife getting cancer treatments.   I was mortified,  made my children apologize and do a chore for them.   I don\u2019t fully approve of once,  but it\u2019s kids,  multiple times isn\u2019t funny", "NTA. I woulda waited on the other side of the door with a paintball gun then threw open the door and lit them up the second it rang", "NTA.", "Lying in wait in your own home? Damn I\u2019d give them all something to cry about", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
