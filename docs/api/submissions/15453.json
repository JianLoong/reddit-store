My girlfriend is American and she's black, I am German - American and white. My great grandparents and grandparents were born in Germany, my great granddad was in the army and they moved to US after the war when my granddad and his siblings were young (and I think some of them had not been born yet) that is my mom's side of the family\n\n\nMy mom was born in America. My dad's family are German and they were born and always lived in Germany. They met in Germany and then my dad moved here too. I was born in America however after I turned 4 we moved back to Germany. We lived there until I was 16 when we moved back to here. My whole family is very stereotypically german, which means pale and blonde hair. \n\nI don't have any racist ideas, neither does my parents or my grandparents. \n\nHowever my girlfriend seems to disagree and thinks she has to \"educate\" us about race, I guess you can picture why giving my family's story. \n\nAdding to that is that my parents don't like her a lot. This is more of a \"no one is good enough for our son\" (I'm their only son) than something regarding her race. However my girlfriend disagrees with that, she thinks they don't like her because she's black and they want me to date a German girl. My parents have never said anything bad to her, not at all. They're just a bit cold. \n\nAnyway to the conflict. I live with my parents still, she came over for dinner the yesterday.  After eating we were chatting, that same day early my mom had been going though our albums of photos and she left the albums at the coffee table.\n\nMy girlfriend asked if she could see the photos and we all were watching the photos. In one I was wearing a Lederhose that is those shorts you may have seen in the movies when a person from Germany or the region is shown. It was for a school act and I was maybe like 7/8. Another classmate was acting like a African person (the school act was about different ethnicities or something like that) and had black make up on his face.\n\nMy mom made a comment about how cute I was and how darker my hair had got. Then my dad laughed at my classmate because of the make up (it was honestly funny and he was making a weird face). \n\nThen my girlfriend noticed the guy and made a comment about how it's racist to make blackface and why is bad to laugh about it. She then turned that into a lecture about why it is bad. I got tired of it and I excused from my parents and asked her to talk outside. I told her that she was making my parents and I extremely uncomfortable saying we're racist for everything we do. I told her she needs to quit that or we'll have to break up because it gets tiring. Then she got angry and started yelling at me. I told her to calm down and that not everything is about race, we were just watching photos, not discussing politics. She called me an asshole and left. Later I called her and she told me to not reach her until I understand why race matter to her. AITA\n\nEDIT: I understand that I was wrong, I'll apologize to my girlfriend and I'll read the articles some people sent me, thanks.", "created_utc": 1682191529, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12vge2h/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_not/", "score": 172, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A child who doesn't understand is not necessarily a racist, but blackface is inherently racist and it's weird that your parents chose that picture to keep and also that they (and you) laughed about it rather than acknowledging that it's an issue. Your girlfriend isn't \"making everything about race\", she's telling you that a specific thing is racist because it is. \n\nI'd also hazard that if your parents dislike your girlfriend and haven't given you an actual reason for it other than \"no one is good enough for my son\", it might be a great time to investigate if \"not good enough\" is tied subconsciously to her being black.", "YTA. Holy crap. \n\n\"I don't have any racist ideas\"\n\n*Is completely okay with blackface*. \n\nLet me let you in on a little hint.

YOU don't get to decide what is racist and what isn't, bud. You DO have a lot of learning to do- a LOT. Starting with understanding why someone painting their face black and putting on a performance mocking black people might be a little *fucking offensive* to black people. \n\nYou were TA when you said \"I don't have any racist ideas\"- if you were brought up in America?

Maybe you really haven't ever thought about it in detail. (You should). \n\nHere's the thing: it is possible to do a *racist thing* without actually being a person who walks around and thinks about how much they hate people of another race. Racism isn't wearing an American KKK outfit circa 1940. In fact, much of it is so ingrained that the people who do those things are convinced they don't have a racist bone in their body. \n\nThey just...     think it's hilarious for someone to put on blackface and pretend to be a raving imbecile. They never stop to think about how doing that *necessarily* implies something about black people in general.

Where you are the asshole is in the fact that you're blowing off her feelings and her experience. You need to honestly listen to her with an open mind. You talk about your and your parents' discomfort? Imagine hers, watching and listening to you all laughing at someone mimicking someone pretending to be like her. Blackface ain't funny. It's hurtful.

Aren't my big lips funny, isn't my black skin hilarious, aren't my tight curls outrageous? HAHAHA.\" There is NOTHING funny about having your race's physical features mocked. Your father laughed at the photo and then you tried to tell your Black gf that he wasn't laughing at the Blackface but the funny expression on the wearer's face. The expression is a PART of the Blackface routine. You really need to educate yourself or accept that your gf is right and let her go, because you and your family are exhibiting racist behavior and acting entitled to that behavior, while discounting or even gaslighting your gf's appropriate repulsion. YTA.", "You're a little too old to not use Google to figure out why blackface is bad. You also take priority of yours and your family's discomfort of being perceived as racist over the fact that someone is nice enough to point out racism and was DATING YOU despite knowing it. She's young and will learn from the mistake of dating you, but you should also do your part to at least learn basic stuff about another ethnicities ESPECIALLY if you decide to date someone of a different background. You have the privilege to walk through life where your demographic is considered the majority and don't face discrimination and microaggression because of it.

Of all the things to get annoyed at is blackface? \"I don't have any racist ideas, neither does my parents or my grandparents\" yet be dismissive about it?\n\nOP your narrative sounds unreliable.

Like I\u2019m at a loss how any educator would think this was a positive and constructive approach \n\nYou need to be an active listener in the feelings your gf is expressing. Instead of holding steadfast on your parents values you need to open yourself up to what your gf perceives. \n\nI\u2019m just dumbstruck that you are so fast at shutting her down. Just because your parents in your eyes aren\u2019t racist does not mean that some of the things they see as cute or funny don\u2019t hold major racial biases.\n\nIt\u2019s like when Elementary schools here in the south have kids dress up in Traditional Indigenous garb for Thanksgiving.

Most black folks would just cut you off for being racist. The fact that your gf is sticking around to explain things and try to better you is very kind, and shows that she cares about you.

You pretty much told her that you don\u2019t care about the racism that was very present in your family just based on that photo alone.

As a German, the idea of Black facing is not really that much ingrained as something bad or evil in our culture, the only real tradition in connection with that is during epiphany to depict one of the three holy kings searching for the Jesus child as black, one kid is black faced. (It is basically a tradition to actually honor that one of the three wise man welcoming him is black.) In contrast, in the US, Blackfacing was used historically for ethnic caricatures, and because of that, it has a very different meaning.\n\nOn the other side, as a German, I can also say: There is some degree of racism against (Edit) black people here. Less direct and targeted racism as we often hear it about the US, but regularly one more born from ignorance because we don't have really a significant minority of African descent here. The main targets of racism are more eastern European and these from the Middle east, so the groups that have a considerable higher percentage within our population. Because of that, there are many especially Black Americans who report very positively how they faced less racism in Germany than they were used to. \n\nMy feeling is: ESH.\n\nYou might have grown up in a German society, but you are now in the US, and I highly doubt that you don't know about the US ideas of what is racism and what is not. Especially with a girlfriend who seems to be very sensitive about these issues probably because of personal bad experienced, you belittled her about her insecurities in that regard. On the other hand, she tries to impose the ideas of what is racist that exist in the US onto other cultures, which have a different history and different traditions and thus other things that were used historically for racism. You both don't take into account the cultural differences of each other, and don't try to understand and mitigate between each other to see the world through the eyes of the other, but belittle the cultural differences you are dealing with.", "ESH. I don't think White Europeans can understand the hundreds of years of blatant racism (and worse) Black Americans have had to face even today, so yeah, blackface is horribly racist.

My great grandparents and grandparents were born in Germany, my great granddad was in the army and they moved to US after the war when my granddad and his siblings were young (and I think some of them had not been born yet) that is my mom's side of the family\n\n\nMy mom was born in America. My dad's family are German and they were born and always lived in Germany. They met in Germany and then my dad moved here too. I was born in America however after I turned 4 we moved back to Germany. We lived there until I was 16 when we moved back to here. My whole family is very stereotypically german, which means pale and blonde hair. \n\nI don't have any racist ideas, neither does my parents or my grandparents. \n\nHowever my girlfriend seems to disagree and thinks she has to \"educate\" us about race, I guess you can picture why giving my family's story. \n\nAdding to that is that my parents don't like her a lot. This is more of a \"no one is good enough for our son\" (I'm their only son) than something regarding her race. However my girlfriend disagrees with that, she thinks they don't like her because she's black and they want me to date a German girl. My parents have never said anything bad to her, not at all. They're just a bit cold. \n\nAnyway to the conflict. I live with my parents still, she came over for dinner the yesterday.  After eating we were chatting, that same day early my mom had been going though our albums of photos and she left the albums at the coffee table.\n\nMy girlfriend asked if she could see the photos and we all were watching the photos. In one I was wearing a Lederhose that is those shorts you may have seen in the movies when a person from Germany or the region is shown. It was for a school act and I was maybe like 7/8. Another classmate was acting like a African person (the school act was about different ethnicities or something like that) and had black make up on his face.\n\nMy mom made a comment about how cute I was and how darker my hair had got. Then my dad laughed at my classmate because of the make up (it was honestly funny and he was making a weird face). \n\nThen my girlfriend noticed the guy and made a comment about how it's racist to make blackface and why is bad to laugh about it. She then turned that into a lecture about why it is bad. I got tired of it and I excused from my parents and asked her to talk outside. I told her that she was making my parents and I extremely uncomfortable saying we're racist for everything we do. I told her she needs to quit that or we'll have to break up because it gets tiring. Then she got angry and started yelling at me. I told her to calm down and that not everything is about race, we were just watching photos, not discussing politics. She called me an asshole and left. Later I called her and she told me to not reach her until I understand why race matter to her. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But to not acknowledge that it was wrong likely made her feel that you thought it wasn\u2019t offensive which I\u2019m sure will lead to disagreements about what\u2019s offensive and what\u2019s okay down the road.", "YTA.\n\nYour reaction to the photos and your gfs comments are what makes you such a clear AH here \n\nMe and my family were looking back at old photos and there were stuffed toys, and one of them has very racist connotations.

I am also European, but not German. There are practically no black people in my home country, I personally know only one in my home city, he is originally from Kenya, came as a student and married a local girl. When I was in primary school, we also had a school event, where different nationalities/races have been presented, and some of the kids wore make up and clothes to represent the relevant nationality. There was absolutely nothing racist about this, exactly the opposite, the overall idea was all people are brothers and sisters, friendship, unity, and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, if you go to Rome, behave as the Romans.", "That is, so far, the most reasonable comment here taking into account the two different cultures / upbringings of OP and his girlfriend. I am German myself and wanted to point out to the custom of the three holy kings in Germany too. \nIt is only a recent development that blackfaceing is perceived racist in Germany and it is still in progress. OP and his parents may not be aware of this development in Germany. However, they live in the US now and his mother was born and raised there, so they should at least be sensitive to the topic and not be dismissive of the girlfriends feelings.\nCommunication is the key.\n\n OP explain to your GF the circumstances and origin of the picture. That at that time it was not perceived racist in Germany. But that it would be perceived racist now, and that most likely a similar picture would not be taken today. Apology to her since it is never okay to dismiss someone's feelings and/or explain to them how they should towards certain topics. Especially when the other side speaks from experience. \nTell her also why Germans are sensitive to the concept of race since it doesn't compare to the US concept. Let her educate you about what is perceived racist in the US and compare it to your upbringing in Germany. Maybe you will understand each other better.\nAnd to make it clear blackfaceing is racist and never okay also in Germany. We should all be able to learn from past mistakes and do better in the present and future.", "Why not consider that it *was* racist, even if it didn't have malicious intent, and that because there are far smaller populations of black folks in Germany than elsewhere there was less public conversation about how these things were wrong? So now that it's 2023 and we have the benefit of time, access to information about why these things are wrong, etc. we can be understanding of why a black woman would be offended by black face even if their wasn't malicious intent?", "That's utter BS. Of course there were Black people in Germany (and likely other European countries as well) in the 90s and 00s.\n\nAnd our Aryan friend here is 20, he was born in 2002/2003. People from that generation are very well aware of what is racist and that blackface is racist. Even if his parents are some Hinterw\u00e4ldler (who btw also had more than enough time to educate themselves), he should support his gf. There's literally no reason (other than ignorance or being racist) to defend blackface.\n\nThat picture was taken in 2010, it's not an artifact back from colonial times when it was \"in\" to dress up as and ridicule Black people. And even if it wasn't done with malicious intent back then, they had enough time to realize that it was wrong and to not make fun of it today.", "It\u2019s not about going back in time and changing the past, it\u2019s about recognizing it in the PRESENT.", "Except that is absolutely not the case here.\nOr do you also think blackface isn't racist?", "I\u2019m German-Australian, part white, party Asian part Australian-indigenous living in US.

But your girlfriend shared that your family laughing at blackface made her uncomfortable (rightly so), and your response to that was \"it's not that serious\". That's not the response of an informed partner who cares about their partner's feelings and comfort. So whether or not you're a racist, you don't care about your girlfriend. She's your ex girlfriend now, I can almost guarantee you that.", "Maybe if every German she knows wasn't actively defending black face, she wouldn't think that", "So if you know why it's bad, why didn't you say anything when your dad laughed at it?", "Ya I\u2019m interested to know what your great grandads ideals were and I\u2019m pretty positive he passed them on even if you don\u2019t understand it", "Come on man the majority of white Germans are racist though.

I'm brown. My parents were both born in Indian but I was not. I currently live in a very white part of America and the things I hear that are not meant to be malicious and come from ignorance would blow people's minds.

If you read further, you will notice that I directly compare the racism against black people that comes mostly from ignorance with racism against much larger minorities in Germany, like people from Middle East (including Turkey).

If someone or something offends me, I would start a conversation why. And trust me it works better than scolding other adults.

My great granddad was judged and not found a nazi, so why would I think he's a nazi?", "Likes what? The constant bitching (as you call it)  when she tries to explain her concerns? Or maybe the downplaying of her needs and concerns?", "Exactly! Like maybe this post was made up. Maybe it wasn\u2019t. But either way if someone is reading it and it resonates with them and my opinion could in any way be helpful sure I\u2019ll gladly give it because the whole point of this thread is to try to persuade or enlighten. Count me in. I just don\u2019t get people that come on here and go \u2018this is FAKE!\u2019. Ok, if you think this is fake and it matters to you why bother commenting?", "Concentration camps were known. They were public knowledge. Footage of them was released as propaganda. The rhetoric used by the Nazi Party specifically spoke of \"purging undesirables.\" The leap from \"let's round up all these people we hate and force them to live in squalor\" to \"let's start murdering all the people we hate and rounded up\" is not a big one. The only thing that was revealed when the Allies found the death camps was the *scale* of the atrocity. The *existence* was known well before then. Also, no one was judged on the basis of \"being a Nazi.\" They were judged on the basis of \"committing war crimes.\" Congrats, your great-grandpappy didn't shank a civilian. This does not exonerate him. Once again, I ask you to self-reflect on why you want to defend someone who was, enthusiastic or not, on the wrong side of history.\n\nRegardless, you're getting off track. Do some reading. Go to a Holocaust Museum and a Black History Museum. Learn. Be better. Waste less time arguing about whether or not someone was a Nazi, and spend your energy on becoming better than those who came before you.", "Weird stance because multiple German people I know, raised in Germany all of their childhood and young adult lives and currently in the 30s, would agree with the comment you responded to. So is it \"thinking like a person living there\", or is it just not wanting to reconcile an ugly truth about your family?", "Almost everything in this comment is completely ahistorical rubbish. There were a few soldiers who refused to do Nazi shit. They weren't punished. And the Holocaust was known. Nazi crimes go far beyond concentration camps. Do you know nothing about the many massacres on the eastern front? Mobile gas vans? Kristallnacht? The Madagascar plan? The Rosenstrasse protest? I don't even study WWII you ignorant half-baked apologist."]}
