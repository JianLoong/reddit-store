My girlfriend is American and she's black, I am German - American and white. My great grandparents and grandparents were born in Germany, my great granddad was in the army and they moved to US after the war when my granddad and his siblings were young (and I think some of them had not been born yet) that is my mom's side of the family\n\n\nMy mom was born in America. My dad's family are German and they were born and always lived in Germany. They met in Germany and then my dad moved here too. I was born in America however after I turned 4 we moved back to Germany. We lived there until I was 16 when we moved back to here. My whole family is very stereotypically german, which means pale and blonde hair. \n\nI don't have any racist ideas, neither does my parents or my grandparents. \n\nHowever my girlfriend seems to disagree and thinks she has to \"educate\" us about race, I guess you can picture why giving my family's story. \n\nAdding to that is that my parents don't like her a lot. This is more of a \"no one is good enough for our son\" (I'm their only son) than something regarding her race. However my girlfriend disagrees with that, she thinks they don't like her because she's black and they want me to date a German girl. My parents have never said anything bad to her, not at all. They're just a bit cold. \n\nAnyway to the conflict. I live with my parents still, she came over for dinner the yesterday.  After eating we were chatting, that same day early my mom had been going though our albums of photos and she left the albums at the coffee table.\n\nMy girlfriend asked if she could see the photos and we all were watching the photos. In one I was wearing a Lederhose that is those shorts you may have seen in the movies when a person from Germany or the region is shown. It was for a school act and I was maybe like 7/8. Another classmate was acting like a African person (the school act was about different ethnicities or something like that) and had black make up on his face.\n\nMy mom made a comment about how cute I was and how darker my hair had got. Then my dad laughed at my classmate because of the make up (it was honestly funny and he was making a weird face). \n\nThen my girlfriend noticed the guy and made a comment about how it's racist to make blackface and why is bad to laugh about it. She then turned that into a lecture about why it is bad. I got tired of it and I excused from my parents and asked her to talk outside. I told her that she was making my parents and I extremely uncomfortable saying we're racist for everything we do. I told her she needs to quit that or we'll have to break up because it gets tiring. Then she got angry and started yelling at me. I told her to calm down and that not everything is about race, we were just watching photos, not discussing politics. She called me an asshole and left. Later I called her and she told me to not reach her until I understand why race matter to her. AITA\n\nEDIT: I understand that I was wrong, I'll apologize to my girlfriend and I'll read the articles some people sent me, thanks.", "created_utc": 1682191529, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12vge2h/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_not/", "score": 874, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A child who doesn't understand is not necessarily a racist, but blackface is inherently racist and it's weird that your parents chose that picture to keep and also that they (and you) laughed about it rather than acknowledging that it's an issue. Your girlfriend isn't \"making everything about race\", she's telling you that a specific thing is racist because it is. \n\nI'd also hazard that if your parents dislike your girlfriend and haven't given you an actual reason for it other than \"no one is good enough for my son\", it might be a great time to investigate if \"not good enough\" is tied subconsciously to her being black.", "YTA. Holy crap. \n\n\"I don't have any racist ideas\"\n\n*Is completely okay with blackface*. \n\nLet me let you in on a little hint.

YOU don't get to decide what is racist and what isn't, bud. You DO have a lot of learning to do- a LOT. Starting with understanding why someone painting their face black and putting on a performance mocking black people might be a little *fucking offensive* to black people. \n\nYou were TA when you said \"I don't have any racist ideas\"- if you were brought up in America?

Maybe you really haven't ever thought about it in detail. (You should). \n\nHere's the thing: it is possible to do a *racist thing* without actually being a person who walks around and thinks about how much they hate people of another race. Racism isn't wearing an American KKK outfit circa 1940. In fact, much of it is so ingrained that the people who do those things are convinced they don't have a racist bone in their body. \n\nThey just...     think it's hilarious for someone to put on blackface and pretend to be a raving imbecile. They never stop to think about how doing that *necessarily* implies something about black people in general.

Where you are the asshole is in the fact that you're blowing off her feelings and her experience. You need to honestly listen to her with an open mind. You talk about your and your parents' discomfort? Imagine hers, watching and listening to you all laughing at someone mimicking someone pretending to be like her. Blackface ain't funny. It's hurtful.

Aren't my big lips funny, isn't my black skin hilarious, aren't my tight curls outrageous? HAHAHA.\" There is NOTHING funny about having your race's physical features mocked. Your father laughed at the photo and then you tried to tell your Black gf that he wasn't laughing at the Blackface but the funny expression on the wearer's face. The expression is a PART of the Blackface routine. You really need to educate yourself or accept that your gf is right and let her go, because you and your family are exhibiting racist behavior and acting entitled to that behavior, while discounting or even gaslighting your gf's appropriate repulsion. YTA.", "You're a little too old to not use Google to figure out why blackface is bad. You also take priority of yours and your family's discomfort of being perceived as racist over the fact that someone is nice enough to point out racism and was DATING YOU despite knowing it. She's young and will learn from the mistake of dating you, but you should also do your part to at least learn basic stuff about another ethnicities ESPECIALLY if you decide to date someone of a different background. You have the privilege to walk through life where your demographic is considered the majority and don't face discrimination and microaggression because of it.

Of all the things to get annoyed at is blackface? \"I don't have any racist ideas, neither does my parents or my grandparents\" yet be dismissive about it?\n\nOP your narrative sounds unreliable.

Like I\u2019m at a loss how any educator would think this was a positive and constructive approach \n\nYou need to be an active listener in the feelings your gf is expressing. Instead of holding steadfast on your parents values you need to open yourself up to what your gf perceives. \n\nI\u2019m just dumbstruck that you are so fast at shutting her down. Just because your parents in your eyes aren\u2019t racist does not mean that some of the things they see as cute or funny don\u2019t hold major racial biases.\n\nIt\u2019s like when Elementary schools here in the south have kids dress up in Traditional Indigenous garb for Thanksgiving.

Most black folks would just cut you off for being racist. The fact that your gf is sticking around to explain things and try to better you is very kind, and shows that she cares about you.

As a German, the idea of Black facing is not really that much ingrained as something bad or evil in our culture, the only real tradition in connection with that is during epiphany to depict one of the three holy kings searching for the Jesus child as black, one kid is black faced. (It is basically a tradition to actually honor that one of the three wise man welcoming him is black.) In contrast, in the US, Blackfacing was used historically for ethnic caricatures, and because of that, it has a very different meaning.\n\nOn the other side, as a German, I can also say: There is some degree of racism against (Edit) black people here. Less direct and targeted racism as we often hear it about the US, but regularly one more born from ignorance because we don't have really a significant minority of African descent here. The main targets of racism are more eastern European and these from the Middle east, so the groups that have a considerable higher percentage within our population. Because of that, there are many especially Black Americans who report very positively how they faced less racism in Germany than they were used to. \n\nMy feeling is: ESH.\n\nYou might have grown up in a German society, but you are now in the US, and I highly doubt that you don't know about the US ideas of what is racism and what is not. Especially with a girlfriend who seems to be very sensitive about these issues probably because of personal bad experienced, you belittled her about her insecurities in that regard. On the other hand, she tries to impose the ideas of what is racist that exist in the US onto other cultures, which have a different history and different traditions and thus other things that were used historically for racism. You both don't take into account the cultural differences of each other, and don't try to understand and mitigate between each other to see the world through the eyes of the other, but belittle the cultural differences you are dealing with.", "ESH. I don't think White Europeans can understand the hundreds of years of blatant racism (and worse) Black Americans have had to face even today, so yeah, blackface is horribly racist.

My great grandparents and grandparents were born in Germany, my great granddad was in the army and they moved to US after the war when my granddad and his siblings were young (and I think some of them had not been born yet) that is my mom's side of the family\n\n\nMy mom was born in America. My dad's family are German and they were born and always lived in Germany. They met in Germany and then my dad moved here too. I was born in America however after I turned 4 we moved back to Germany. We lived there until I was 16 when we moved back to here. My whole family is very stereotypically german, which means pale and blonde hair. \n\nI don't have any racist ideas, neither does my parents or my grandparents. \n\nHowever my girlfriend seems to disagree and thinks she has to \"educate\" us about race, I guess you can picture why giving my family's story. \n\nAdding to that is that my parents don't like her a lot. This is more of a \"no one is good enough for our son\" (I'm their only son) than something regarding her race. However my girlfriend disagrees with that, she thinks they don't like her because she's black and they want me to date a German girl. My parents have never said anything bad to her, not at all. They're just a bit cold. \n\nAnyway to the conflict. I live with my parents still, she came over for dinner the yesterday.  After eating we were chatting, that same day early my mom had been going though our albums of photos and she left the albums at the coffee table.\n\nMy girlfriend asked if she could see the photos and we all were watching the photos. In one I was wearing a Lederhose that is those shorts you may have seen in the movies when a person from Germany or the region is shown. It was for a school act and I was maybe like 7/8. Another classmate was acting like a African person (the school act was about different ethnicities or something like that) and had black make up on his face.\n\nMy mom made a comment about how cute I was and how darker my hair had got. Then my dad laughed at my classmate because of the make up (it was honestly funny and he was making a weird face). \n\nThen my girlfriend noticed the guy and made a comment about how it's racist to make blackface and why is bad to laugh about it. She then turned that into a lecture about why it is bad. I got tired of it and I excused from my parents and asked her to talk outside. I told her that she was making my parents and I extremely uncomfortable saying we're racist for everything we do. I told her she needs to quit that or we'll have to break up because it gets tiring. Then she got angry and started yelling at me. I told her to calm down and that not everything is about race, we were just watching photos, not discussing politics. She called me an asshole and left. Later I called her and she told me to not reach her until I understand why race matter to her. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But to not acknowledge that it was wrong likely made her feel that you thought it wasn\u2019t offensive which I\u2019m sure will lead to disagreements about what\u2019s offensive and what\u2019s okay down the road.", "YTA.\n\nYour reaction to the photos and your gfs comments are what makes you such a clear AH here \n\nMe and my family were looking back at old photos and there were stuffed toys, and one of them has very racist connotations.

Racism against asians is also pretty common.", ">On the other hand, she tries to impose the ideas of what is racist that exist in the US onto other cultures, which have a different history and different traditions and thus other things that were used historically for racism. \n\nBlackface is inherently racist.\n\nThat some countries haven't reached as much of an awareness of that as others doesn't make it any less racist. \n\nAnd btw there are growing numbers of people in Germany and the Netherlands that do believe three wise men blackface is not ok. \n\nCulture can excuse the OPs original ignorance, but it doesn't excuse OP from being open to learning.", "The most balanced and thoughtful comment in this tread. I am also European, but not German. There are practically no black people in my home country, I personally know only one in my home city, he is originally from Kenya, came as a student and married a local girl. When I was in primary school, we also had a school event, where different nationalities/races have been presented, and some of the kids wore make up and clothes to represent the relevant nationality. There was absolutely nothing racist about this, exactly the opposite, the overall idea was all people are brothers and sisters, friendship, unity, and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, if you go to Rome, behave as the Romans.", "That is, so far, the most reasonable comment here taking into account the two different cultures / upbringings of OP and his girlfriend. I am German myself and wanted to point out to the custom of the three holy kings in Germany too. \nIt is only a recent development that blackfaceing is perceived racist in Germany and it is still in progress. OP and his parents may not be aware of this development in Germany. However, they live in the US now and his mother was born and raised there, so they should at least be sensitive to the topic and not be dismissive of the girlfriends feelings.\nCommunication is the key.\n\n OP explain to your GF the circumstances and origin of the picture. That at that time it was not perceived racist in Germany. But that it would be perceived racist now, and that most likely a similar picture would not be taken today. Apology to her since it is never okay to dismiss someone's feelings and/or explain to them how they should towards certain topics. Especially when the other side speaks from experience. \nTell her also why Germans are sensitive to the concept of race since it doesn't compare to the US concept. Let her educate you about what is perceived racist in the US and compare it to your upbringing in Germany. Maybe you will understand each other better.\nAnd to make it clear blackfaceing is racist and never okay also in Germany. We should all be able to learn from past mistakes and do better in the present and future.", "Why not consider that it *was* racist, even if it didn't have malicious intent, and that because there are far smaller populations of black folks in Germany than elsewhere there was less public conversation about how these things were wrong? So now that it's 2023 and we have the benefit of time, access to information about why these things are wrong, etc. we can be understanding of why a black woman would be offended by black face even if their wasn't malicious intent?", "That's utter BS. Of course there were Black people in Germany (and likely other European countries as well) in the 90s and 00s.\n\nAnd our Aryan friend here is 20, he was born in 2002/2003. People from that generation are very well aware of what is racist and that blackface is racist. Even if his parents are some Hinterw\u00e4ldler (who btw also had more than enough time to educate themselves), he should support his gf. There's literally no reason (other than ignorance or being racist) to defend blackface.\n\nThat picture was taken in 2010, it's not an artifact back from colonial times when it was \"in\" to dress up as and ridicule Black people. And even if it wasn't done with malicious intent back then, they had enough time to realize that it was wrong and to not make fun of it today.", "It\u2019s not about going back in time and changing the past, it\u2019s about recognizing it in the PRESENT.", "Except that is absolutely not the case here.\nOr do you also think blackface isn't racist?", "I\u2019m German-Australian, part white, party Asian part Australian-indigenous living in US.

But your girlfriend shared that your family laughing at blackface made her uncomfortable (rightly so), and your response to that was \"it's not that serious\". That's not the response of an informed partner who cares about their partner's feelings and comfort. So whether or not you're a racist, you don't care about your girlfriend.

Tja, verglichen mit anderen Familien haben manche von uns aber schon nen gro\u00dfen Vorteil davon, wenn unsere Gro\u00dfeltern oder Urgro\u00dfeltern nicht umgebracht wurden, oder als Fl\u00fcchtlinge auswandern mussten. Du kannst nix daf\u00fcr, dass du diesen Vorteil hast. Aber du kannst dich respektvoller verhalten, dich informieren, und dein Bestes tun um nicht die Fehler unserer Vorfahren zu wiederholen.", "Or you and other Americans can stop being imperialistic and stop imposing your standards and culture on everybody else. I know you like to look at everything through the lens of a race, but others do not.", "But why is she lecturing him and his family over something that happened 20 years ago? \n\nI don't think anyone argues that doing blackface is okay. But it's an old childhood memory. Even if it's not okay by today's standards, it's their family photo book.", "I disagree", "Erm.. they might think the arranged marriage question is acceptable to ask because it still happens, though. My chemistry professor immigrated from India and arranged his very American daughter's marriage, despite her protests. And my coworker right now from Afghanistan said he considered it as well. It happens all the time so I'm confused why you found that particular question offensive", "I attended a small high school in the mid 1990s, that had an average population of about 380 students.  6 students were minorities, every other student was white.  All but 1 of those minority students were foreign exchange students, so overall I grew up in a pretty homogenized area.  Even so, I still was taught that racism is still an ongoing in American society.  I\u2019m sorry your school and your teachers failed you by giving you the false impression that it no longer exists.", "I am not being sarcastic, ya\u2019ll seriously did not learn about the history of racism in this country. What was your history lessons like on slavery, the reconstruction era and Jim Crow? This is probably the most shocking things I have read. What was taught in American History?", "\"Xennial\"? Would you mind just writing down your age in decades so that it's clear to other people what age range you're talking about?\n\n\"I'm in my [ late / mid / early ] twenties, thirties, fourties\" etc.", "I mean you are simply wrong here. I remember seeing some kids in an event that includes fancy dress in black face in rural Denmark. Trying to explain to my Danish uncle about black fack and why it's racist, he just couldn't understand because it doesn't have any of that history in Denmark. Still not ok same as fancy dress as a geisha would be inappropriate but it's simply not the same as it is in America. \n\nI can see how in Germany 20 years ago this would have be socially acceptable and not viewed as racist but merely as a costume. I am not saying I think it is ok myself obviously but just giving some cultural context.\n\nOOP and his mother who grew up in the US should have a better understanding of the cultural context in the US though. Seems like they are racist in the I don't want to make any changes or effort way", "So what?", "In parts of Germany they celebrate the so called Fassenacht, celebrating the end of winter and scaring away harmful spirits. One costume has a black face. This tradition predates Christian times and was created centuries before any Germanic tribe even saw a black person.

I just can't keep count of how other ethnicities have been portrayed by white people.", "They do. Those groups just don't make a fuss about it. Europeans never considered black face a racist thing, since the wholer racist part comes from America and the historical use of blackface in America. Europe doesn't have that so we don't have the same connotations as Americans.   \nThe fact that Americans think they get to dictate intend is just good all American superiority thinking their discourse runs the world.   \n\n\nIn this example telling your girlfriend you will break up if she doesn't chill it with making everything about race is a bit extreme,  but i think everyone can imagine how tiring it must be to hang around someone who can turn even the most innocuous of occasions (looking at childrens photos) into a lecture on race.", "You realize it isn't in the past and still happens right? That racism is still alive and well. That there are literally hate crimes still going on.", "How do you \u2018use it as a chance to open up a discussion\u2019 without that immediately being \u2018she lectured us on race?\u2019. His family clearly didn\u2019t want to acknowledge it and that\u2019s the whole issue here.", "The reason why Germany allows this stems from the fact that blackface doesn't have the same connotations in Europe that it has in the US. \n\nEurope never had a substantial black minority until fairly recently (think 30/20 years ago tops), and while black makeup was used on occasion to make crass and racist jokes about black people, most of its use came from theatre and cinema, where it was difficult to find and hire actors of colour because there simply weren't any to be found. \n\nNow today there are black actors available to play black people on the stage or in films, so a lot of people would disapprove of hiring a white actor with black makeup when a black actor is available. \nAnyone sane would obviously cringe and disapprove of using blackface the way it was used by some comedians in the 60s, using racist stereotypes to mock black people. \n\nBut I doubt most people would disapprove if, say, a rural school in the ass end of Germany, with no black kids attending, were to put black makeup on a random child to put up a little performance about the different population of the world. \n\nHence why this thing isn't seen as an issue in Germany. Europe still has to wrap it's head around the whole blackface thing. \n\nThat's not an excuse though, OP is American, he should be aware of the connotations blackface has in America, and he should have been considerate enough to not show the picture to his girlfriend. Besides, a lot of black people feel uncomfortable around blackface, even if you don't understand why, it's only fucking polite not to engage in a behaviour other people find uncomfortable when said people are present.", "Not quite. \n\nHe is meant to be black, but originally he was a Moorish page. \nHim being a liberated slave came later.", ">  It was for a school act and I was maybe like 7/8. Another classmate was acting like a African person (the school act was about different ethnicities or something like that) and had black make up on his face.           \n\nRacism means to discriminate or marginalize based on race or ethnicity.   No one was being discriminated against in this elementary play.  I don't know how many Black people are in Germany, but i'm guessing not many.  Likely they didn't have anyone of Color to play this role.   I'm not sure what a suitable alternative would be, i guess just no make-up and just SAY the kid is portraying a black person?", "I\u2019m not wrong. You\u2019re literally missing my point. \nYou\u2019re saying your uncle couldn\u2019t understand bc it doesn\u2019t have any of that history in Denmark. \n\nMy point was regardless of that, the act of black face is still racist!! Just because someone isn\u2019t aware or have knowledge of a racist act, it doesn\u2019t omit the fact that the act is racist.", "Why did this get down voted lmao", "I think there are similarities. Blackface can be misappropriated in other cultures I think this would be more comparable to porn vs a naked body with no sexual context. It\u2019s like someone culturally taking offense to a standard naked body, because they are deeply conditioned that this is a shameful/sexual thing that should be totally private. Same level of awareness in both accounts & cause for belief. Anti-racism is equally as conditioned as racism, so people have a very strong reaction to anything perceived as racism, even if it\u2019s not the case. Like stereotypes, we all recognize them and unless they are intentionally used to harm someone, are pretty innocent. I speak openly with so many people. I\u2019ve probably spoken to at least 20,000 people in my 14 years of customer service & stereotypes are typically acknowledged and accepted without negative regard by the culture they portray. Consider this, a young American football bro, eating hamburgers, and doing dumb teenage stuff w his friends. Now think of this a morbidly obese person with diabetes rolling around Walmart & buying cakes wearing an American flag hat that\u2019s entire identity is wrapped in whatever politics they represent. Those are both stereotypes, one is offensive. Idk, I\u2019m rambling lol. \n\nEdit: remembered where I was going w this \nMost people who are knee jerk anti-racist (which overall I consider to be a good thing, the only downfall is unperceived nuances in the general pop & the ability to create a focus in the media large enough to create mass distraction - not that it\u2019s not important or necessary, but that it can be controlled) assume that a stereotype is offensive and it can actually impede cultural education, it closes the door to conversations between cultures because stereotypes = bad; which they generally are but they also open the door for a lot of communication to happen between individuals about what is offensive to them & what isn\u2019t. Does that make sense?", "How exactly?", "Hitler.", "Then you definitely consume too much US content and let it influence you.", "Nope", "I'm from Austria which is culturally very similar to Germany and while I see that a lot of things in our culture are problematic, they are not always racially motivated, or let's say it's so deeply rooted in culture that people have no idea about the possible initial racist origin of certain practice. Most of our culture is based on pagan traditions or Christian (heavily catholic).\n\nKrampus as others have pointed out is not human, but a beastlike mystical creature. \n\nLot of it is tied to Catholic church that is still strong here (more in Austria than Germany). We have \"Sternsinger\" every year that cosplay to represent the holy 3 kings, that gave presents to baby Jesus. And 1 of them is traditionally blackface. \n\nBlackface seems less severe to us probably, because we don't have the negative history associated with it like the US. We are also used to it due to stuff like the Sternsinger tradition. In general Germany and Austria is way less divers than America. Seeing a black person here is still rare outside of major cities. And even there they are a smaller minority. \n\nThere are certainly more racist impressions about people from Turkey or muslim countries or Balkan or Middle East. There used to be a huge immigrant wave from Turkey and those people were never properly integrated, which built a lot of resentment on both sides. Balkan and middle East are usually tied to being refugees. \nAmong some people there's especially more resentment towards Middle East or even African refugees because they have a very different culture (Muslim) and because some people consider them economic refugees from far away. People are a bit more open towards Ukraine refugees because they \"feel\" closer or more like us. Balkan is also a difficult topic, because of the history of the Austria-Hungary monarchy. \n\nOverall black people are not very present here, positively or negatively. Only more recently, starting from the 2015 refugee crisis, have black people been more present, but with the image of refugees most prominent. \n\nSo, I think it's important to discuss cultural relevance in situations like this. While things like blackface are racist either way, and I don't want to downplay it, please don't misunderstand, it will have different relevance or associations depending on where you live and grew up. It's important to give people some grace and educate, rather than shame, because the topic of blackface doesn't really come up when growing up in Germany or Austria. If there's a schools play with a black person, there is often no black kid to play the part, so someone is dressed up. So the choice is either to not depict different ethnics in plays if you have nobody of that origin and whitewash, or it's makeup. \n\nHistory and culture play a huge part in how these things are perceived. We can and should always learn and improve, but it doesn't mean everyone is malicious intentionally. \n\nIt's rather insensitive due to ignorance. And the best way to cure that is having a friendly and open conversation to educate. Unless the person proofs to be an asshole or major racist, but that shouldn't be the default assumptions, because it prevents communication and education. \n\nI'm sure there's plenty of things that someone from the US wouldn't see a problematic or would act insensitive to someone from a different culture without any bad intention.", "What the hell you talking about, blackface is absolutely considered racist over here in Europe too. As is dressing up as any minority group.\n\nThe family deserved a lecture because they didn\u2019t see any issue with it. We have a family photo of me and my brother dressed up as native Americans and it\u2019s such a cute picture it\u2019s been kept. But whenever it makes an appearance it\u2019s prefaced with \u2018oh god we did so much shit back then we know not to do back then this very much was not ok\u2019.\n\nEdit: oh and for reference I\u2019m from a small town and we didn\u2019t learn these kind of things at all, but now live in a big city. My mum wouldn\u2019t have known better but we have now educated her as millennials who have a much better understanding of why these kinds of things were problematic", "I\u2019m sorry WHAAAAT?  What do you mean they don\u2019t consider it racist? Everyone knows that black face is racist. I live in the Netherlands and trust that after the protests (kick out zwarte Piet) EVERYONE knows. Yes, us POC\u2019s here still have to tell them how blackface makes us feel. Especially to the older generation that cling to some ridiculous idea that it\u2019s solely for entertainment of the children. It took some time but a lot is and has changed over the past 15 years since the protests became more prevalent. I am inclined to believe OPs family missed the memo whilst traveling back and forth but your statement is blatantly false in my experience. \n\nSource: ME, a black woman in the Netherlands.", "Yes I do. Believe me when I say I see it daily. I am talking in reference to the op who stated they were looking at the photos which, given he was a kid would\u2019ve happened easily 10-15 years ago. In those circumstances, opening up a discussion and talking TO not AT has got to be a better way to educate people who might otherwise not realise how or why it\u2019s wrong", "I suspect this is true, I\u2019m from a small rural English town with almost no diversity and I can absolutely see that my school would have put on a school play in the 90s, under Blair\u2019s \u2018multiculturalism\u2019 where we \u2018learnt all about other races and cultures\u2019 with an appalling broad brush strokes approach of grouping large populations together and learning a few basic facts (stereotypes) about \u2018people from Africa\u2019 with one single child representing the entirety of Africa dressed up in a mismash of vaguely African items of clothing that had been dug out of parents fancy dress boxes because there would have been no one other than white kids to play the non white parts. And the play probably would have ended with some message about how racism is bad, with racism being defined as saying hateful things to people with a different skin tone or judging them before you even know them only\u2026 all round good intentions terrible execution!\n\nHowever I am much older than OP and I absolutely 100% understand that while not meant to be offensive and not fitting in to the extremely narrow definition of racism = yelling the N word at Black people it is absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt still ultimately very problematic and ultimately built on some racist ideas. That doesn\u2019t make OP and family \u2018A RACIST\u2019 (although the whole picture builds up to that being likely) any more than it makes me \u2018A RACIST\u2019 for the picture I have of me at about 4 with \u2018Indian\u2019 (as in cowboys and \u2018indians\u2019) face paint and headdress on. It\u2019s been kept in the family album because it\u2019s a very sweet picture of me and my brother but we absolutely acknowledge that element of it is very problematic and based on racist stereotypes and we know better now and have moved on from doing stuff like this when looking at that picture. How OP can be 14 years younger than me, also from Europe and not get that is staggering.", "Fair enough in the sense that I'm not German so honestly I'm not in a position to know what people there think but I DO live in the UK and can honestly assure you we know blackface is bad and have done for years. Sure there are plenty of \"political correctness gone mad\" types who'll try to tell you it's all nonsense that's gone too far, but blackface wouldn't have been included in any school performance even 30+ years ago when I was at school, and I'm in Scotland which wasn't at all progressive then.", "There is where we disagree. There is nothing inherently racist about dressing up as someone of a different race, it is racist due to context of it being used to portray a group in a negative light.

Same as the swastika isn't inherently problematic (see Hinduism) but is with the context of events in Europe.", "Wrong again but you're welcome to waste more of your time trying to find justifications to dismiss my point of view\ud83e\udd23", "Fellow European here and where I am it's quite divided, we have the whole Zwarte Piet/Black Peter thing going on and people are being so stubborn and stupid about it.\n\nThere's another tradition called 'Three King's Day' that seems to have largely disappeared but was definitely a thing when I was a kid... we would dress up as the three wise men from the nativity story and go around the neighbourhood singing a song at the doors in exchange for coins or candy (think trick or treat but we had to sing and there were no tricks).

At all.", ">While some perpetrators in the Holocaust claimed, and may have believed, that they would be physically harmed if they did not follow orders to participate in mass murder, historian Doris Bergen notes that the Nazis did not harm those who refused:  \n>  \n>Germans were not forced to be killers. Those who refused to participate were given other assignments or transferred. To this day no one has found an example of a German who was executed for refusing to take part in the killing of Jews or other civilians. Defense attorneys of people accused of war crimes have looked hard for such a case because it would support the claim that their clients had no choice. The Nazi system, however, did not work that way. There were enough willing perpetrators so that coercive force could be reserved for those deemed enemies.\n\nDoris L.
