Im totally cool with that, i like long hair on guys, so this isnt a style judgement thing. \n\nMy nephew is 8, and his hair is all the way down to his butt. He used to get really upset by people asking if he was a girl all the time, but his mother shot down any requests for a hair cut. Now he just introduces himself as \"Hi, Im X, im a boy\".\n\nWhen he was in his mothers care, he would come for visits with knots so big some of them looked like dreads because she wouldnt wash or brush his hair. This was years ago, he definitely wasnt old enough to do it himself, and it would take me and or my mother an hour or more to get all the knots out while he cried about hating having so much hair. \n\nHis mother has been a revolving door parent his entire life, but up until now she has always had custody even when she disappeared for months at a time with no visits. After she good hooked on fentanyl she didnt visit or call for six months. After she started putting my niece and nephew in actively dangerous situations my mother filed for custody and now she and i each have them for half the week, and my sisters visitation was suspended after she did something that really hurt my niece. \n\nWhen my nephew realized it was going to be a while before hed see his mom again, he jumped and asked for a haircut, and admitted he wanted to cut it all off himself but he knew how mad his mom would be. My mother is all for it so i booked him an appointment and he picked out a short style he likes. It will be the first time since he was born that his hair has been this short. \n\nHes ecstatic, and whether im the AH or not i am going to take him, but i do feel like an AH knowing his mother is going to be furious.

Thank you!", "NTA, if you are taking over the **care** of your Nephew, because his mother has lost that right/privilege, and he wants to get a haircut... then that **IS** part of his care.\n\nPlease give him that agency", "NTA\n\n> i do feel like an AH knowing his mother is going to be furious. I love him so much, but hes also not my kid.\n\nKids shouldn\u2019t be treated like property that parents have total control over; it is appropriate for an 8yo to decide what haircut they want.\n\nKids NEED to start being able to make decisions about themselves, and wanting a specific haircut is not going to endanger them.\n\nAlso as your mother and you currently have custody of them, you are not obligated to act as a cop for his mother.\n\nYou have the legal and moral authority to let him get a haircut.\n\nAnd frankly his mother has no grounds to say shit as she\u2019s an abusive, neglectful parent. Her opinion is worthless.\n\nIf the long hair is a cultural thing I\u2019m sad your nephew wants to cut it, but 1. It\u2019s still his hair, and 2. For him the long hair is a source of pain and a symbol of a controlling, neglectful parent. Let him have this chance to be free of this.", "YWNBTA, even if the only thing wrong with his mother would be the hair thing. With 8 years of age children definitely should have a say in their haircut and your nephew absolutely hated his long hair for years, so the chances that he will regret his new haircut is zero.", "My son has long hair. It would/will make me so sad when/if he decides to cut it. However, it's HIS hair and when he makes a decision about it, I will be the one to drive him. Do what HE wants", "NTA. He wants it cut.

When you abandon your child you lose the moral rights to start crap with the people doing your life choice.\n Your sweet nephew is 8Yrs old.\nBody autonomy is his now. He has the RIGHT to choose to have his hair cut and  It's time  and important he learns healthy age appropriate self care.\nI wish you the most and please don't be bullied by \"mom\" she doesn't hold the cards. Do keep notes and details on any issues she causes or threats and mistreatment.  Proof to show the courts.\ud83d\ude4f", "Not exactly.  It depends on what type of custody order they have.  If this is a permanent custody arrangement, they can do this.  If this is a temporary order through a child protection agency, (like a shelter order or a foster care placement), parents have the right to refuse haircuts.", "That's great too!  Whatever positive experience he can get from this will only benefit him more!  He gets control back of his own self, as well as knowing he has done good in the world.  That's awesome!  :)", "Wow!
