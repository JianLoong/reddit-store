Im totally cool with that, i like long hair on guys, so this isnt a style judgement thing. \n\nMy nephew is 8, and his hair is all the way down to his butt. He used to get really upset by people asking if he was a girl all the time, but his mother shot down any requests for a hair cut. Now he just introduces himself as \"Hi, Im X, im a boy\".\n\nWhen he was in his mothers care, he would come for visits with knots so big some of them looked like dreads because she wouldnt wash or brush his hair. This was years ago, he definitely wasnt old enough to do it himself, and it would take me and or my mother an hour or more to get all the knots out while he cried about hating having so much hair. \n\nHis mother has been a revolving door parent his entire life, but up until now she has always had custody even when she disappeared for months at a time with no visits. After she good hooked on fentanyl she didnt visit or call for six months. After she started putting my niece and nephew in actively dangerous situations my mother filed for custody and now she and i each have them for half the week, and my sisters visitation was suspended after she did something that really hurt my niece. \n\nWhen my nephew realized it was going to be a while before hed see his mom again, he jumped and asked for a haircut, and admitted he wanted to cut it all off himself but he knew how mad his mom would be. My mother is all for it so i booked him an appointment and he picked out a short style he likes. It will be the first time since he was born that his hair has been this short. \n\nHes ecstatic, and whether im the AH or not i am going to take him, but i do feel like an AH knowing his mother is going to be furious.

The kid hates his hair, and he\u2019s in you and your moms care. Think about what the kid wants.", "NTA, your nephew wants it", "NTA. You have custody and his hair is impacting his health (mental and partially physical) so cutting it is both morally and legally right. If his mom was his guardian I'd still say it would br best to cut it as she doesn't maintain it or help him keep it up.", "NTA because the long hair is a health and safety hazard and you\u2019re the guardian anyway", "NTA. You may be an asshole to the mom, who is an asshole herself, but you\u2019ll be the hero to the kid who is just seeking some bodily autonomy.

Long hair takes a lot of work to keep it neat and detangled, and if he doesn't like it, it'd be cruel to insist on him keeping it.

You can do what you see fit. I am so happy he is going to get a haircut he loves. People don't realise how much of our confidence can come from our hair.", "NTA.  His mother is just an egg donor.

My boys have long hair but it's because of our indigenous culture and beliefs. Your sister lost her voice to make these choices for her children when she started not being a decent parent to them. But if he has had his hair this length his entire life, I personally would direct him to something not super short but slowly get to that point. He may cry once it is gone and wish he didn't go so short. Or he may cry tears of happiness. In my culture, our strength is in our hair, which is why we cut our hair when our loved ones pass and send it with them on their journey. I think you're doing it with good intentions. You're not forcing him. He's asking to have it done. Oh gosh, just think of how great his head will feel once the weight is lifted off. Also, the emotional weight as well. The trauma he has will be lifted because he probably connects his long hair with his mother and the trauma he's gone through with her. Good luck to all of yall \ud83d\udc93", "Not sure where you're located or the exact nature of the custody order, but look into the rules to be sure.  If it's a kinship foster placement and not full, final custody, haircuts are a specific thing requiring specific permission in some jurisdictions.

Old enough to decide his hiar style.", "I guess i feel like because she has lost my respect that this is going to come off as a \"F you\" to her even though thats not why im doing it. And i am trying to be as civil as i can theough this whole process which hasnt been easy", "Now that hes with us, his hair doesnt get like that anymore. We brush it twice a day and have detangling conditioner just for him, it only got like that when his mother was allowed to take him for extended periods.  So in all fairness,  his *physical* wellbeing isnt in jeopardy with long hair anymore, but i think his mental wellbeing is.", "I think you just helped me realize part of why i feel guilty. She lost custody for a good reason. I AM angry with her for what she did to them. I think i feel like she doesnt really deserve the respect of being able to make calls on their behalf anymore. Maybe my brain is equating that to this being a spiteful move, even though i am 100% doing this for him.", "Technically my mother is his guardian and i just babysit half the week, but she is on board and it is defi itely what he wants", "The next step in court if/when she complies with orders would be supervised visitation with a court appointed supervisor. Im not sure if i would be allowed to be there but i do plan to prep him the best i can to handle anything she might say", "She definitely wouldnt get any kind of alone custody with him after what she did to his sister, at least not for a very long time. Best case scenario for her is she gets supervised visitation with a court appointed supervisor afyer the ne t court date but even thay seems unlikely as shes being pretty uncooperative with the judges demands. And im fully prepared for her to take a swing at me when she finds out, thats fine. I wont let her hurt him though.", "I think i feel like such a butt because i know how pissed i would be if someone messed with my kids hair,  but at the same time, i wouldnt make my kid sit through years of a haircut that he hated", "They are in therapy, and she isnt actually legally allowed to visit them right now but the next step in court if/when she complies is court appointed supervised visitation in a public place. Im hoping shes not dumb enough to lash out at him with a court supervior standing there, because thay would crush him.", "Exactly my thought: you are both his legal tutors so you make the decisions. That\u2019s the end of it. The mother can stop cutting his hair once she gets back custody (if it ever happens)", "Definitely not being pressured, if there is any pressure its in the opposite direction from people wanting him to keep it long. And ive always taken the stance that its his head he should have it how he wants, but ive gotten a lot of backlash in the past because \"im not his mom its not my call\" when ive brought it up.", "Thats fair. Ive been called the AH for ragging on my sister about not letting him get it cut and her not taking care of it before, but he is older now.", "She has actually made that accusation when its been brought up in the past, that we only want to cut it because its important to her. And shes screamed that while hes im tears while me and my mother were trying to get the knots out as gently as we could. Shes unbelievably self centered to the point of blindness.", "I'm not sure if i have a different answer tbh, i might still feel the the AH at the end of this even if everyone says im not, but id feel like more of an AH  not doing it with hiw long hes been begging for a haircut", "At this point its only a mental impact, me and my mother work really hard to keep his hair maintained, we brush it two or more times a day and have special product to keep the tangles out. It only gets matted when his mother has him for extended periods.", "I wish i could use the health and safety as an excuse, but with us his hair is fine. We work very hard to maintain it so hair brushing doesnt hurt and it doesnt tangle. It his mental wellbeing we worry about.", "If she was still allowed to take him, the neglect would be an arguable factor on my end, but shes not even allowed to see him right now, so his hair is actually very well maintained. At this point its just the fact that he hates it and what could happen in the very unlikely event that she gets unsupervised visitation again.", "I agree. But in all fairness to honesty, i though it should be his call when he was four and crying about how much he hated his hair too.", "Definitely will lol", "I feel like this is less me worrying about her opinion, i know shell be furious, and more about whether or not i owe her more respect as his parent whether she has custody or not. And i dont respect her right now. So while im doing this for him, idk it feels vindictive. Or maybe i am just worried she will see it thay way even though it isnt. Its tough.", "We are 48% native american, but my sister isnt into it for that reason. For her its entirely a style thing because so many men in our family have long hair (many of them do keep it long for cultural reasons, but not all) That can be shown by the fact she always kept my nieces hair just longer than a bob cut, and she herself has had her hair done extremely short in a few occassions unrelated to grieving.", "My mother has primary physical and my sister had visitation but it was revoked, were in NY. I dont think there are any legal issues though because when i was 11 my stepmother had my head shaved without my or my mothers consent with joint custody and the police said they couldnt do anything", "It goes both ways, sweetie.  She has not been civil.  Your focus needs to be the children, not their druggie mother.", "Your nephew is old enough to have a say in his own appearance, and he is asking for something entirely reasonable. The AH move in this case would be to tell him that is opinion on himself is not important", "Maybe it is time for a white lie so that your nephew can get a cut he actually likes without being attacked by his mom for it. Chewing gum can be hard to get out, as can a lot of other stuff where it would just make sense to get a cut. I don't know what scenario could work for you, but if your nephew is on board, I'd go for it.", "You're mad at her because she is neglecting those children to the point where your mom had to get custody.  This isn't spiteful.  You are helping to care for the children.", "I think the rule for these kind of decisions (hair style, clothing choice, hobbies, basically age appropriate self expression) should be up to the child in question plus one guardian. You\u2019ve got that so you\u2019re not only NTA but the hero this kid needs since you are listening to what he wants and caring for him after what sounds like a tough start in life.", "Damn that\u2019s rough , sorry for your niece and nephew sounds like they\u2019ve had it tough. Good thing they have you and your mum in their corner though!! I hope he loves his haircut", "Ultimately you have the little fellas best interests at heart. He\u2019s 8, he know what hairstyle he wants, he\u2019s had years of a style he doesn\u2019t love. The Mam, as sad a situation that is, is not about to be making the calls now.

She's not allowed to see them so you and your mom do what you need to do.", "Obviously NTA!", "Sweet as then it's his choice \n\nyou're right it's not his moms hair or your hair it is his hair he's not a doll or toy for her to curate ;he's a small human growing and learning how to be a big human and being able to choose your own haircut is part of that\n\nShe'll likely throw an entitled tantrum (my mum literally screamed and cried when I cut my own hair at first - it was awful emotionally because I felt guilty for doing something that also made me happy due to her response ) but that's not your or his fault so do remind him that his body including his hair belongs to him and nobody else and that somtimes people react unkindly like how his mother is but that it's more about her than him and it's not his fault or his responsibility to manage her emotions \n\nINFO: Could you try to get guardianship of him or adopt him?\n\nIs he in therapy? (highly recommend)", "It\u2019s gross how people will say that when a concerned adult tries to advocate for a child who had the misfortune of being born to shitty parents.", "You know in your heart it will make him happy. That sense of justice (that you feel as vindictive) is earned. Helping a child out, when their own parents can\u2019t, is an amazing gift you\u2019re giving. Just talk your little one through it. Explain why you think it\u2019s ok, even if mommy seems upset at first. \n\nHow long does she go between seeing him? If it\u2019s infrequent, she may not even see how short it\u2019s cut. \n\nBig hugs and good luck. I truly know how difficult it is.", "With that said. If she is doing it purely for esthetic reasons I still say NTA. She didn't take care of his hair or protect it. And girl we don't go by that 48% stuff. That's colonizer blood quantum. Yall are indigenous through and through. Don't let anyone tell ya other wise. We all have our own reasons for keeping our hair long or short. Not all of us keep it long. But my boys do because we keep it long for our family members who were forced to have there's cut at residential school. But my husband he has short hair. He used to have very long native thick hair. But he's currently doing chemo and has multiple brain surroundings he has opted to keep it short. I think yall definitely have your nephews best interest at heart for sure. If your sister gets pressed about it then hit her with facts.... like the fact she's an unfit parent who let her boys hair get so matted it put him in physical pain to have it fixed. You got this girl!", "Also I'm sorry I assumed you were female when I ended my last reply. If your not I correct myself.", "He is really excited, which helps. He went through hundreds of pictures before settling on the style he wants", "He and his sister are both in therapy and right now my mother has primary physical and his mothers visitation has been suspended. I will be sure to talk to him after and try to make sure he takes as little a blow from his moms reaction as possible", "Im going to try to reframe it in my mind as justice. She has gone as long as six months without a visit, but rn she isnt allowed to see them until she meets court demands.  It would take years for his hair to grow back as long as it is now though so she'll definitely notice when the time comes for her to see them. He wants it short short and its down to his butt now"]}
