Im totally cool with that, i like long hair on guys, so this isnt a style judgement thing. \n\nMy nephew is 8, and his hair is all the way down to his butt. He used to get really upset by people asking if he was a girl all the time, but his mother shot down any requests for a hair cut. Now he just introduces himself as \"Hi, Im X, im a boy\".\n\nWhen he was in his mothers care, he would come for visits with knots so big some of them looked like dreads because she wouldnt wash or brush his hair. This was years ago, he definitely wasnt old enough to do it himself, and it would take me and or my mother an hour or more to get all the knots out while he cried about hating having so much hair. \n\nHis mother has been a revolving door parent his entire life, but up until now she has always had custody even when she disappeared for months at a time with no visits. After she good hooked on fentanyl she didnt visit or call for six months. After she started putting my niece and nephew in actively dangerous situations my mother filed for custody and now she and i each have them for half the week, and my sisters visitation was suspended after she did something that really hurt my niece. \n\nWhen my nephew realized it was going to be a while before hed see his mom again, he jumped and asked for a haircut, and admitted he wanted to cut it all off himself but he knew how mad his mom would be. My mother is all for it so i booked him an appointment and he picked out a short style he likes. It will be the first time since he was born that his hair has been this short. \n\nHes ecstatic, and whether im the AH or not i am going to take him, but i do feel like an AH knowing his mother is going to be furious.

He has such lovely curly hair and demanded it be shaved from four years old on due to all the touching by people.  So it is very physical.  But if you\u2019ve never been in the situation, you wouldn\u2019t know.", "Typically it\u2019s pretty taboo to abandon your child for 6 months. \n\nMost people get haircuts every 1-2 months. \n\nAbandoning your child for 6 months and then being mad that their hair got cut is like disappearing for a week and being mad that somebody fed your child. \n\nIt\u2019s basic self-care. Do you know a single person who just never gets hair cuts?", "Thats a good idea. Ill make sure its in a tight braid so we can keep it without it falling apart", "Ive always seen it that way, but on the ocassions i brought this up befpre she lost custody the general consensus was that she is his mother, she gets to call the shots", "Were actually working really hard on not lying, as its a bad habit she actively tried to instill in them, but also wouldnt work to calm her down. He got headlice from school twice and she still wouldnt allow it to be cut. She wasnt the one paying for the copious amounts of lice treatment or the one sitting there for hours with a tiny lice comb trying to get everything out, but even that wasnt a good enough reason for her, gum wouldnt be any different.", "I used to have hair as long as his, but i was pretty scary looking and so was my mother so there was no pulling or touching lol, but yeah i can remember sitting on it, having it get stuck in clothes, jewelry, hair shed on everything. I actually get a lot more touching issues with short colored hair. Especially old women for some reason lol", "Im so used to specifying because im one of the few in the family who got the irish skin tone from the other half XD so i automatically get shit on when i say im indigenous despite the fact that im extremely active in our culture. I appreciate the pep talk though, its nice to be reminded i dont always have to cater to other peoples expectations lol", "Most of the guys in our family actually lol. Not even trims for a lot of them. But they are adults and it is their choice.", "(maybe be sure she wants it before you offer it to her? worst case she could see it as insult to injury, best case a touching gesture.) nta, kid wants it, guardian is cool\nwith it, go forth and chop.", "The job of the parent and of any custodian is to make sure that the child is OK. They do have the right to \"call the shots\" with the understanding that those decisions will be for the best of the kid. Not everyone is good at it. Your sister sounds like someone who doesn't even really care for what is good for the kid. So, as a custodian, you are making the right decision for all the right reasons I would say.", "I don't think you need to lie at all. Your nephew is old enough to have a say in how he looks, and managing very long and thick hair is difficult and not fun for a child. I would know, I had to do it and I desperately wanted shorter hair when I was that age too! If she is bothered, stand your ground and say it isn't up to her, your nephew is happy and well cared for. Her view no longer carries weight.", "If she doesnt want it, he still might. Im not in contact with her at all and dont even actually have a way to ask until after it will be dead", "definitely keep it, that\u2019s a great idea. i\u2018m just saying if you see screaming or throwing things on the horizon don\u2019t give her the hair to throw.", "Makes sense"]}
