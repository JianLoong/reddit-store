By getting a color you know she doesn\u2019t wear you were being thoughtless of her preferences.

Bro. My guy. Friend, I had a glance at your post history. You have deep dysfunction in your relationship. Extremely deep. And it sounds like you have a long history of not being thoughtful and a good partner to someone who doesn't feel recognized, someone who has had fragile mental health and needs your support. If you aren't both deeply invested in this marriage, get out now. The fact that you're trying to make it into something about a watch is kind of the core of the issue here. It's not the watch. It's the hundreds and probably thousands of ways you were inconsiderate and didn't actually care about what your wife wanted.}\n\nYou bought something for your wife in a color you **know** she doesn't wear. This is an expensive piece of technology (and therefore an investment for most people) so instead of checking with her, you just decided to get it _anyway._ And now you're upset she doesn't like the thing you knew she wouldn't like. It sounds like you just wanted a new Apple watch and didn't really care she didn't get what she wanted, you just wanted her to be satisfied anyway.\n\nAdmittedly I do think the accusation that you're doing it to hurt her might be a lot. Normally I would say she is TA as a result. I strongly believe that you should usually receive gifts very graciously. However, that reaction, combined with your comment about how you admitting that you consistently \"fall short\" makes me extremely curious if this is an ongoing pattern. When you give someone something that they have to wear, like jewelry or clothing, you have to be extremely sure it's the size, color, and style that they would wear. Although I don't really believe in the love language nonsense, it sounds like she's someone who highly values thoughtful gift-giving and receipt. There is, unfortunately, a long history of men giving inconsiderate gifts to women in their lives because of something they prioritized without checking in with them (getting their own watch, using their preferred provider, getting a deal, etc.) about what her priorities were.\n\nI get that you were hoping to secure both of you an Apple watch through this deal. But it comes off as \"I knew she wouldn't really like it but I'm upset she said I did it to hurt her, when the truth is I just didn't take her preferences into account.\"\n\nIt sounds like you two are really communicating past each other around this topic. She doesn't feel sane and cared for in a way that she values and you feel her reaction was an overreaction. You need to be able to talk openly and vulnerably about this and talk about how you're going to avoid it in the future.", "ESH.

I\u2019m sorry the sweet (and expensive) gesture was not appreciated. I think you guys need to talk about the response, is she currently going through some difficult times?

I have 2 adult kids (boys) and my husband. Kids are home temporarily for personal and financial reasons. There are times I\u2019m frustrated living with all men. Ugh. It\u2019s probably exacerbated since I\u2019m also a caregiver for my mom and at times feel I can\u2019t get a break. \n\nI will purposely buy things (insulated mugs, pens, notepads, blankets etc) that are pink or floral. Not that I necessarily want it in those colors but I know they won\u2019t use or take them if it\u2019s bright pink or floral. Lol. Stay away from my stuff!", "Sadly, Wellbutrin is the antidepressant that makes me cry uncontrollably with little to no warning and for no reason at all.", "My ironclad thing is... my Harry Potter lego collection. All the releases from recent years. 99% still in the boxes because I tried to assemble ONE SMALL one, and the kids pulled it apart and lost half the pieces. I bought a replacement and just put everything in a closet.", "If it were me in this scenario, I'd be completely bewildered my husband bought me something I'd have to wear.  With my sensory issues, I don't wear any of the jewelry I own.  I seldom wear my wedding ring because my hands swell and shrink too much to keep one good fit.  (My husband is fine with this, says if I need the ring to remember I'm married, we have a bigger problem.)\n\nIt might be an honest slip but it could also be just one more example of \"Does this person I love know me af all?\"", "I just asked my husband of 16 years and he got it backwards. \"Well I know you don't like silver so gold.\" He tried \ud83d\ude05", "That\u2019s fine for you. You\u2019re not OPs wife and it\u2019s not fine for her.", "I love mixed metal jewelry as well as wearing all three options.  But my favorite is rose gold and my husband knows this. \n\n(Literally just checked with him and he looked adorably confused while answering, lol)\n\nHowever, I do understand the situation that OP was in - when there\u2019s limited options, you go with the lesser of evils which unfortunately happened to be the silver watch.  Although this is my covid hermit status betraying me, don\u2019t apple watches allow for covers to be put on them, basically a phone case for a watch?  I\u2019ve never had one so I\u2019m not very familiar with them.  But I know when my parents upgraded my phone for me and the only color option was black, I was disappointed that I couldn\u2019t get what I wanted but still grateful that I had a better phone than before.  And I just bought a beautiful case that hid the black.", "So why not pick black? Oh because you wanted to be the AH.", ">  Some husband's don't pay attention to their wives, and visa versa.\n\nthat's.... sad. I've been married 15 years and I love my spouse so much. I love doing things that make them happy. I can't imagine things otherwise. This makes me sad for a lot of people.", "Me too. People think I\u2019m weird, but I\u2019m the same way with Pepsi and Coke.\nAnyway, I\u2019d be so stoked about getting a cool watch, l probably wouldn\u2019t care if it didn\u2019t match anything else I was wearing. I\u2019d wear it every day and be grateful for the loving gesture. I think some people are being too hard on the poor guy, he seems sweet and like he really means well \ud83d\ude0a", "I think it depends on how you go about it. If you ask the wife to make a wishlist to take out all the guess work, that definitely adds more to her load. But I don't think finding a gift and checking to see if she'd like it, or what color she'd prefer before buying would add work on her end.", "Can you post a picture of the ring? I'd really like to see it after reading what you had to say about it!", "You should melt it down! If it's massive there should be plenty of gold to recreate your mom's ring.", "Dads usually are so oblivious with gift giving.. or at least, mine is.\n\n i have to remind my dad to do this or do that for mom, because he doesnt look at things like we do. or my sibling will buy a gift and tell dad to gift it to mom. then dad goes \" dear, the kids bought this for you. happy ___ day!\" \nfacepalm! lol... but he does do all the small things in the house, some chores, laundry, cooking breakfast (mom does dinners).", "I currently have purple titanium, silver and black stainless steel in my ears and gold in my nose. I love it", "He does most the house work, cleaning, and taking care of the kids. Sounds like this work trip isn\u2019t a regular thing from reading his posts.", "Those are all assumptions. They both work and he does most the child care, cooking, and cleaning. She gets home from work grabs her iPad and goes to the room. I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with shortcomings in his part. More likely medication, switch or adjustment needed.", "Literally!! When he said it was between white and silver my brain was like please don\u2019t say you picked silver!", "I mean, my husband knows I only wear silver or white gold jewelry, cause more colorful metals just accentuate how paper white I am. But if he bought me an expensive smart watch in gold, I sure wouldn't throw a hissy fit about it. I'd be razzed about finally having a smart watch. I get that his comment history indicates that she's depressed, and that can manifest in unpleasant ways, but good grief. Losing your cool over a new $600 smart watch because it's the wrong color is such a first world problem it's hard to know where to begin. Just makes her come off as a petty, entitled brat who's actively looking for reasons to complain about the good things in her life. And I say this as a bipolar mom of two with post-partum depression. I'm no stranger to behaving in antisocial ways due to depression. But that's an explanation, not an excuse. I usually apologize for going off about something stupid after I've had time to cool down and reflect. \n\nNTA\n\nEdit: For reference, I'm also no stranger to getting awesome, expensive gifts in a color I hate. As a teenager, I wore a lot of black, because, again, my natural coloring is essentially greyscale. White skin, black hair, and grey eyes. So my dad, in protest of my gothy, monochrome proclivities, always bought me hot pink things for birthdays or Christmas. First decent iPod: hot pink. A nice kindle fire in a hot pink case. First cell phone had a hot pink cover on the flip part and a hot pink car charger. \n\nI hate hot pink. He knows this. He was being a troll. I still loved the gifts. I've long since upgraded the phone and kindle, but I still use that iPod and car charger to this day. It didn't even occur to me to throw a fit over the high-end gifts just cause they were a color I didn't like.", "I mean...  he just spent $1,200 to replace watches that still work, just have slightly depleted battery life, and aren't remotely a necessity to start with...\n\nthey obviously aren't hurting.\n\nI was joking with my husband about this the other day.  He knows a couple where the wife is a doctor and the husband has a job he travels for, and I was like \"If one partner makes doctor money, why would the other partner have a traveling job just to make more, more money.  Surely they could find a job where they could actually be around, and still be just fine financially\"...  we live in a lower cost of living area and they only have one child, so there's not some crazy extenuating circumstances.\n\nBut some people don't seem to understand the time vs money equation.  If traveling for their job makes them slightly more money, they do it, instead of looking around at what they have and figuring out what will actually make them happier with their life.\n\n$600 could have paid for home many visits from a cleaning lady?  How many hours of childcare/babysitter so the wife could have some time to herself?  Etc.", "I'm glad it worked for you. It made me suicidal. Drugs don't have the same effect on everyone.im also not just crapping on Wellbutrin. I know it works well for some", "I don't even have to ask. My partner knows I prefer sterling but can't wear it and bitch about the upkeep, so white gold or platinum it is.", "I think it has a lot to do with the listening, but could also have a lot to do with how she is and has been doing mentally. It\u2019s so much easier to get mad, sad, offended when you are in that headspace. \nWishing OP and Mrs. OP all the best, healing, happiness, and love!\ud83d\udc9c\n\nEDIT: To add NTA \n\nYou are just trying your best, OP and it makes me sad that you get excited to do and buy these things for her, then feel like you somehow messed up. Just keep trying your best. It\u2019s just a little rough patch that you and your wife WILL get through! Sending more love, healing, and happiness your and your wife\u2019s way, OP.", "He spent 600 dollars on something she didn\u2019t want instead of 2 seconds verifying. I\u2019m so sick of guys like this getting constant passes for being thoughtless. I would never get my husband something if there was two options and one is something with a little thought I\u2019d know he\u2019d not prefer. And if I did, I would apologize and sell it and get the right color, or return it. This is someone that has bought her jewelry before. Someone thoughtful towards their partner learns their preferences.\n\nETA and if I wasn\u2019t sure I would ASK especially if it was something that cost that much money."]}
