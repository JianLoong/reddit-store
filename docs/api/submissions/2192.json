I got mine which was the same size and colour but my wife\u2019s the only one I thought she\u2019d like was silver and white. \n\nSo I get parcel tracking and thought it would be a nice surprise for her to open when I knew it arrived (being that I\u2019m away with work it was going to be a remote surprise) and I asked if she would open the parcel that came for me that day. \n\nInitially she was happy that I\u2019d surprised her that way until she opened the box and said words to the effect of \u201cugh, why did you get me a silver watch?

I can also acknowledge that yes, I should\u2019ve been more thoughtful but I was limited in the range that was available? \n\nNow I have a $600 watch that won\u2019t be worn and an angry wife.

I was feeding the baby and he offered to get me something. I asked for a bagel. I got a cold bagel. I was bummed, but thankful for food. He gets a hot English muffin with butter and honey every night before bed. I will even make it for him when he's feeding the baby.  I later asked him why my bagel was cold. He froze like a scared cat and said \"I thought you liked them that way. I always see you eating them cold.\" I told him that while I was grateful, I eat them cold most of the time bc I'm tired, starving and don't have the patience to wait for it to be warmed up. I'm also typically in a hurry.\n\nYou tried and fell a little short, and she's hurt bc she feels you didn't pay enough attention. It's not the end of the world.

My skin has yellow undertones and silver looks awful. I have received silver jewelry more than once. After the first, second and third reminder I gave up. I see these pieces as a sign of the state of our marriage. One more thing to really push home the fact that he honestly just doesn\u2019t give a crap, but a real FU if I have the audacity to complain. Cue misunderstood face and gaslighting about my lack of gratitude. I don\u2019t wear silver, but I own earrings and a necklace from anniversaries past. They gather dust and sometimes he wonders why I don\u2019t wear my jewelry. Only you know if you are the ahole.", "It seems a petty response but I've been there. How many times did she express her dislike for silver? Because I've repeated at every possible occasion growing up how much i hated navy blue, and honestly when my mom kept buying me navy blue stuff \"why blue again\" was the first thing i said and i didn't feel happy or thankful at all.", "INFO: do you guys have shared finances?", "NAH, but you should have just asked her about it instead of trying to guess what color she would like. Not every gift has to be a surprise.", "The bit that is REALLY concerning about it isn\u2019t that you got a surprise wrong or didn\u2019t pay enough attention to what colours she likes\u2026the issue is that she\u2019s decided you did it INTENTIONALLY to hurt her.\n\nSo you planned a surprise but then as a sting in the tail picked the colour you knew she\u2019d dislike and not wear to hurt and punish her?!!

Go thru the buyers remorse process.", "Lmao NTA. She can just go exchange it if she hates it so much but who is that ungrateful for a surprise apple watch? Like it's not silver jewelry, unless they have a different band than I'm imagining?", "Did you know that she doesn't wear silver? Because I personally do not wear silver ever. It just doesn't look good on me and I also don't like the way silver appear. If ur wife has other silver jewelleries than its on her but if she doesn't than u should've just asked even if u tried to surprise. Again I'm basing this on my own experience I always find silver things to look tacky on me because I've a gold undertone, so I'd rather not where jewellery. As for judgement ur intentions were sweet so u're probably NTA", "NTA\n\nHer reaction was childish and uncalled for. Not liking the colour is completely understandable, but she could have expressed that in so many other ways instead of going 'ugh you know I don't wear this colour'.\n\nYou mentioned in other comments that your wife likes surprises, but I think you might need to gently point out that surprises mean that she might not like what she gets when she's got such strong preferences when it comes to colour.\n\nMaybe ask for a list of colours she likes for future purchases? Say, she'd like blue over everything else, but green if blue isn't available, red if green isn't available, etc.", "YTA for not asking her about the color. But why is this a big deal? Can't the watch be exchanged?", "NAH. You can exchange the watch. Or replace the band and get a case. You tried to do a nice thing. She does wear that color. You're both right.", "When we say that it's the thought that counts, we mean that your wife would have been perfectly happy with \"I wanted to buy this for you, but I wasn't sure you would love the color so I didn't. Would you like this if I buy it for you or do you want us to look somewhere else?\"", "NTA.  Unfortunately at the moment we live in a world where all \"colors and sizes\" are simply not available.  Your wife could learn to be just a bit more flexible.", "ESH. \n\nYou-I think her issue is the lack of (perceived) thought in picking the color for her. If you knew her at all then you would\u2019ve know she wears gold jewelry instead of silver so you shouldn\u2019t have got her a silver watch. By getting a color you know she doesn\u2019t wear you were being thoughtless of her preferences. (This is what I think she thinks here) I think she has a point here, you bought a watch based on what was part of the promotion being offered and not based on her actual tastes. \n\nHer-She is.making this into a bigger issue than it should be and being ungrateful of your gift.", "NTA? Is it not returnable if she didn\u2019t like the color?", "INFO: was there a gold option?", "NAH but idk maybe a little. Like this sort of thing feels silly to me, but at the same time I know it would be a big deal to my mom. And I do think part of the issue is knowing what's important to our loved ones even if it seems silly to us. I don't think you did it intentionally to hurt her, but she might think its just as hurtful that you didn't think about it or didn't know her well enough to realize it would be a big deal to her.", "Go on Amazon and get her a pack of bands in every color as well as the watch faces. Sheesh, it's not that hard.", "NTA Your wife is a brat OP", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry she made you feel bad for doing something thoughtful.  There are infinite bands available in all materials and colors and the actual silver part of the watch barely shows. You meant well and intent is everything.  I hope this type of response is a one-off and not the norm, because accusing you of deliberately trying to hurt her is extreme.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShe can exchange it for what she want but the way she reacted you could return it & just get your money back. She sounds a little ungrateful.", "Im so sorry. NTA at all.\n\nThis sucks. Im sorry you are being gaslit and abused.\n\nI think you need to leave this relationship.", "You are not the AH. However, your wife is. \nSounds like she\u2019s very ungrateful for the things she\u2019s gifted. I\u2019d she doesn\u2019t like the color, she can order a case on Amazon for it. She did not need to lash out at you for something as small at that. Try to reason with her by sending her gold cases (they do have these) on Amazon to see if she\u2019s be interested in that.", "NTA. You can buy protective covers to change the face trim colour. I'm pretty horrified that your wife has turned it around to make you the villain.", "NTA. My significant other did the same for me a couple of years ago - bought me an Apple Watch and I thought the silicon band was soooooo ugly. You know what I did? I thanked him for the lovely gift, then went on Amazon and bought myself a leather replacement strap for ten bucks and called it a day. There was absolutely no reason for her to treat you so abhorrently in response to a thoughtful gesture.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is an expensive piece of technology (and therefore an investment for most people) so instead of checking with her, you just decided to get it _anyway._ And now you're upset she doesn't like the thing you knew she wouldn't like. It sounds like you just wanted a new Apple watch and didn't really care she didn't get what she wanted, you just wanted her to be satisfied anyway.\n\nAdmittedly I do think the accusation that you're doing it to hurt her might be a lot. Normally I would say she is TA as a result. I strongly believe that you should usually receive gifts very graciously. However, that reaction, combined with your comment about how you consistently \"fall short\" makes me extremely curious if this is an ongoing pattern. When you give someone something that they have to wear, like jewelry or clothing, you have to be extremely sure it's the size, color, and style that they would wear. Although I don't really believe in the love language nonsense, it sounds like she's someone who highly values thoughtful gift-giving and receipt. There is, unfortunately, a long history of men giving inconsiderate gifts to women in their lives because of something they prioritized without checking in with them (getting their own watch, using their preferred provider, getting a deal, etc.) about what her priorities were.\n\nI get that you were hoping to secure both of you an Apple watch through this deal. But it comes off as \"I knew she wouldn't really like it but I'm upset she said I did it to hurt her, when the truth is I just didn't take her preferences into account.\"", "ESH.
