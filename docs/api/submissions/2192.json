Bro. My guy. Friend, I had a glance at your post history. You have deep dysfunction in your relationship. Extremely deep. And it sounds like you have a long history of not being thoughtful and a good partner to someone who doesn't feel recognized, someone who has had fragile mental health and needs your support. If you aren't both deeply invested in this marriage, get out now. The fact that you're trying to make it into something about a watch is kind of the core of the issue here. It's not the watch. It's the hundreds and probably thousands of ways you were inconsiderate and didn't actually care about what your wife wanted.}\n\nYou bought something for your wife in a color you **know** she doesn't wear. This is an expensive piece of technology (and therefore an investment for most people) so instead of checking with her, you just decided to get it _anyway._ And now you're upset she doesn't like the thing you knew she wouldn't like. It sounds like you just wanted a new Apple watch and didn't really care she didn't get what she wanted, you just wanted her to be satisfied anyway.\n\nAdmittedly I do think the accusation that you're doing it to hurt her might be a lot. Normally I would say she is TA as a result. I strongly believe that you should usually receive gifts very graciously. However, that reaction, combined with your comment about how you admitting that you consistently \"fall short\" makes me extremely curious if this is an ongoing pattern. When you give someone something that they have to wear, like jewelry or clothing, you have to be extremely sure it's the size, color, and style that they would wear. Although I don't really believe in the love language nonsense, it sounds like she's someone who highly values thoughtful gift-giving and receipt. There is, unfortunately, a long history of men giving inconsiderate gifts to women in their lives because of something they prioritized without checking in with them (getting their own watch, using their preferred provider, getting a deal, etc.) about what her priorities were.\n\nI get that you were hoping to secure both of you an Apple watch through this deal. But it comes off as \"I knew she wouldn't really like it but I'm upset she said I did it to hurt her, when the truth is I just didn't take her preferences into account.\"\n\nIt sounds like you two are really communicating past each other around this topic. She doesn't feel sane and cared for in a way that she values and you feel her reaction was an overreaction. You need to be able to talk openly and vulnerably about this and talk about how you're going to avoid it in the future.", "ESH.
