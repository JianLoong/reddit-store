Bro. My guy. Friend, I had a glance at your post history. You have deep dysfunction in your relationship. Extremely deep. And it sounds like you have a long history of not being thoughtful and a good partner to someone who doesn't feel recognized, someone who has had fragile mental health and needs your support. If you aren't both deeply invested in this marriage, get out now. The fact that you're trying to make it into something about a watch is kind of the core of the issue here. It's not the watch. It's the hundreds and probably thousands of ways you were inconsiderate and didn't actually care about what your wife wanted.}\n\nYou bought something for your wife in a color you **know** she doesn't wear. This is an expensive piece of technology (and therefore an investment for most people) so instead of checking with her, you just decided to get it _anyway._ And now you're upset she doesn't like the thing you knew she wouldn't like. It sounds like you just wanted a new Apple watch and didn't really care she didn't get what she wanted, you just wanted her to be satisfied anyway.\n\nAdmittedly I do think the accusation that you're doing it to hurt her might be a lot. Normally I would say she is TA as a result. I strongly believe that you should usually receive gifts very graciously. However, that reaction, combined with your comment about how you admitting that you consistently \"fall short\" makes me extremely curious if this is an ongoing pattern. When you give someone something that they have to wear, like jewelry or clothing, you have to be extremely sure it's the size, color, and style that they would wear. Although I don't really believe in the love language nonsense, it sounds like she's someone who highly values thoughtful gift-giving and receipt. There is, unfortunately, a long history of men giving inconsiderate gifts to women in their lives because of something they prioritized without checking in with them (getting their own watch, using their preferred provider, getting a deal, etc.) about what her priorities were.\n\nI get that you were hoping to secure both of you an Apple watch through this deal. But it comes off as \"I knew she wouldn't really like it but I'm upset she said I did it to hurt her, when the truth is I just didn't take her preferences into account.\"\n\nIt sounds like you two are really communicating past each other around this topic. She doesn't feel sane and cared for in a way that she values and you feel her reaction was an overreaction. You need to be able to talk openly and vulnerably about this and talk about how you're going to avoid it in the future.", "ESH.

I'd either never wear it and always feel bad about it, or I'd try to get the use out of it by wearing it and every time I looked at it, I'd feel disappointed that I didn't like it, the little stab of pain that I'd been bought the wrong thing by somebody who probably should have known better and then guilt again for feeling like that and not being more grateful.\n\nAnd owning the damn watch I didn't like would also stop me from buying a watch I did want.", "No I believe he did it with incompetence, lack of respect and taking his wife for granted.", "Okay? But people can be frustrated by their partner phoning it in. I don\u2019t like yellow gold. I don\u2019t want expensive gifts I wouldn\u2019t wear. My husband knows me", "Her reaction makes me wonder if it's part of a pattern. I could see her reaction as mean, or I could see it as understandable frustration over feeling like OP doesn't listen to her.", "I read it . Just why buy something without the effort?", "Hmmm, I\u2019m not sure I understand where you\u2019re coming from here.  His literal username is Adefeatedguy, and he\u2019s admitted that he knows that she doesn\u2019t like silver jewelry and that he ignored that.  But most of his responses are about how he just can\u2019t seem to do anything right, and how his wife is just never satisfied, when by his own telling, she has a pretty valid reason for being upset.\n\nThe guy made a mistake, like we all do.  He\u2019s acting like a bit of an AH about it, but I\u2019m not sure how that makes him a pantomime villain??", "She\u2019s probably can\u2019t believe he could be so dense so malicious intent seemed a more practical reason", "Not to mention that the color should ultimately be a non-issue? I have a faceplate and replacement band on my watch. Why can\u2019t the wife do that? \n\nI have a black faceplate and band on mine now. It wouldn\u2019t have been one I bought for myself, but it was a Christmas present last year and I took it gratefully instead of complaining and acting like it was a personal slight.", "For a gift *that price* it would have been wise to ask if you don't pay attention enough to your partner to be able pick the right colour.", "There was thought put in to it. The battery life of her watch was becoming increasingly poor, so he got her a new one. In what world is that \u201cthoughtless\u201d?", "Alright so just my opinion but, there's a huge difference between accidently upsetting someone and purposefully doing so. If a partner of mine tried to purposefully get a rise out of me with something like an expensive gift they knew I wouldn't like I'd probably be getting out of the relationship. But a mistake can be talked through like two adults", "> But people can be frustrated by their partner phoning it in.\n\nOkay? And what's that got to do with your question?\n\n>My husband knows me\n\nI bet he does. Ever since that time he bought you a brand new white BMW and you got frustrated, because it wasn't blue, I'm sure he's very, very careful.", "I'd agree up until she accused him. Being disappointed would've been fine, not making it out like he purposefully got her the watch to upset her.", "He slipped on a color and she accused him of doing it on purpose to upset her, do you honestly think he did that with malicious intent? I don't.", "I swear to god u captured the perfect manner that social media uses this term and it honestly makes me upset", "A gift that price may not be as big of a deal to these people as it is for you. Again, he said she was happy with the gift up until the color. I don\u2019t think someone would refuse to wear a $600 smart watch because it is silver if the cost was the issue. If she was pissed about him buying her a watch in the first place, then sure, make that argument all you want.", "Because he didn't bother to make sure that she would like the appearance of something she wears *every day.* It's a milder version of men who don't bother to consider their partner's taste when they buy engagement/wedding rings.", "But is it a mistake? You\u2019ve heard your wife tell you for years she doesn\u2019t not like silver, and you forget? And then think well it doesn\u2019t matter that she doesn\u2019t like it she should just be grateful I got her anything at all. Who cares if she has preferences, I wanted to do something nice and it doesn\u2019t matter what she\u2019s told me in the past.  The bar is so low for men, and still they can\u2019t get a simple thing right after years of being told the same thing over and over again.", "Lol\u2026 you just assume for me? No. He knows me like I know him. Thank you for thinking we are bmw people, but we are not.", ">I'd agree up until she accused him.\n\nI think it has to do with their relationship dynamic, she's accusing him of doing it on purpose to hurt her, now he's in the comments accusing her of not wanting him to fix the problem by changing the watch because she wants to hurt him and make him feel bad... I mean, instead of assuming the worst of each other they could definitely try to work on their communication.", "Not malicious but careless. And careless can feel personal when it\u2019s from your partner", "He didn't slip. He knew it was a color she didn't like and the type of jewelry she didn't wear. It wasn't an accident, he just decided it wasn't as important to him as it might be to her.", "I disagree. People with less money still have preferences and still would be hurt by this enough to not wear it.", "Forgetting is a mistake, yes.", "That's a great point, I just don't believe that's an excuse for how she reacted, communication is key and accusations aren't a part of that", "You said that like he made a conscious decision to go against what she likes, he mentions in the post he wasn't thinking of colors just the practicality of a smart watch.", "But when things have broken down? We only see things when that\u2019s already happened . If I can see this from his perspective? What does she see?", "> my wife\u2019s the only one I thought she\u2019d like was silver and white. \n\nIf he's not thinking of color, why did he think she would like silver and white?\n\n> I acknowledge that she prefers gold jewelry. But I wasn\u2019t thinking of colours, more the practical requirement that the smart watch would be for her?\n\n\"I was only thinking about the fact that the smartwatch was a smartwatch.\" That doesn't even make sense as a defense. Then why not get it in whatever other color it was available in. And he just said he thought she would like silver and white.\n\n> I can also acknowledge that yes, I should\u2019ve been more thoughtful but I was limited in the range that was available?\n\nSo again, why did he choose silver and white, if it was truly random and he just wanted to get her any smartwatch."]}
