You ditched your wife of 32 years over takeaway food??? \n\nI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re 50+ but still, you need to grow the fuck up dude.", "YTA\n\nI'll get lynched for saying this but did you get through 32 years by not making any compromises.\n\nJudging by the comment you think you're allowed this behaviour because the car is expensive. Let me tell you something: Everyone buys the best car they can for the money they're earning. Everyone's car is in proportion to their wealth as valuable to them as yours is to you.\n\nIf you have the money for a Porche, you have the money to invest in an air-tight container to keep in your truck. A human > object. If you're so tight on your rule, at least offer a way for your wife to be escorted home safely like a taxi. Or just air the car. It's just a bit of food, nothing air can't fix.", "YTA you could have wrapped it in extra bags or something?! What a stupid hill to die on.", "YTA it's not that she was going to be eating in your car, it was simply a box. You could have rolled the windows down, put it in the trunk, or even carried large Ziploc bags in the car and have her put the box inside of there if you care that much. You need to find some way to compromise here.", "YTA.  A small bit of pork chop in a container just for the ride home is not going to leave a lingering odor in your car.  This takes control freak to a new level.", "Wow. Just wow. You know you can get your car detailed, right?\n\nYTA. But I guess your Porsche is simply more important than your wife. And now everyone knows it.", "YTA. There is a compromise here and your extreme rigidity on this topic is alienating and inconsiderate. Get a clean, airtight container that you keep in the trunk, that you can put packaged food/takeout into for short periods. Allow takeout but not actually eating in the car. These are two ideas that would  preserve your general sentiment towards cleanliness and odor control without literally forcing your wife to find another away home just because she has leftovers.", "YTA!\nYou sound like a horrible husband. 32 years and you still treat your car better than your wife?!? I am wondering what else you do to your wife? You sound like a piece of work!", "YTA. You care more about your car than you for your wife. You might need to pick one or the other because it sounds like your wife might be tired of playing second fiddle to an inanimate object", "YTA. \n\nI love my car. I spent over $80k on it.

Your *clothes* pick up odors from restaurants, too; do you strip before you get into your car?", "YTA\n\nIf you are so worried about the car's condition, then learn to detail.\n\nIts a box for 10 minute? 20?  Not like she's eating it and potentially spilling it.", "YTA. its your wife and a take home box.\n\nalso - you may want to consider the fact that as you are married, in most jurisdictions that means all of the cars are actually half owned by your wife anyway.

You made your wife get another ride home so that the temporary smell of pork chop wouldn\u2019t be in your car? It was in a box dude, it\u2019s not like she was going to lay it out on the dashboard and go to town. \n\nShe\u2019s an adult, perfectly capable of holding a box upright for a short ride home. You have issues.", "Yta - waste food because you don't want a to go container in your car long enough to drive home??

Get a car spray and loosen up.", "YTA - How are you going to feel when there will be a day that you have your good smelling car, but not your wife, unless you pass first?  If there had been an accident and your wife was critically injured, or worse, could you have lived with yourself?\n\nI'm sure your wife was embarrassed and humiliated in front of her friend. Those friends probably don't have a high opinion of you. Time to grow up.", "YTA. It's taking home food in a box, not chowing down on a McDonalds. Could always take an airtight container if you don't want to risk spillage. \n\nMaybe your wife should gift you a bottle of new car smell spray. Eternal new car smell! \n\n(Working for food delivery can make your car smell of food on a more permanent basis but carrying the odd to go box isn't going to permanently stink out your car).", "YTA for caring more about a car than you do about your wife.", "YTA - I wonder if you're also the troll who couldn't pick his kids up at daycare when his wife had a migraine because he didn't want to put carseats in his car.", "I thought this was going to about **eating** in the car; asking people not to eat in the car is mostly reasonable. \n\nBut not -carrying- food in the car?  Not letting -your wife- carry food in the car?\n\nYTA.", "YTA, bruh", "YTA\n\nShe is not eating messy food in your car, which you would have a right to say no to, she is just transporting it.

You have the right to not let people bring food into your car, but a pork chop and some sides don\u2019t seem like they\u2019re particularly smelly.

Im leaning towards soft YTA because it\u2019s really not that big of a deal and she really enjoys the leftovers// it\u2019s doesn\u2019t seem particularly smelly.
