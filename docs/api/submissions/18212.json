I have no kids, myself, but many of my friends are parents, and some stay at home with the kids while the other parent works outside the home. I've heard some commonalities. When you're at home with the kids all day, you have to do EVERYTHING to keep the household going and the children cared for. Often when the other parent comes home, the kids are so, so happy and excited to see them and the stay-at-home parent can feel unappreciated. They've worked constantly with no breaks all day long, and the other parent is the one they're happy to see. I'm not making any assumptions about your household or your wife's feelings, but if she happened to feel that way last night (or whenever this happened) I can see how she may want to step in and be the one the kid(s) actually want to see. \n\nOn the flip side, if a child calls for \"mom\" it doesn't mean \"only mom is allowed to come get me\"; the child wants a trusted adult to ease their worry or distress. Mom is the one who does it all day long, so naturally she's calling for mom. It isn't wrong of you to step into that role. Of course you want to ensure that your children are safe and that their needs are attended to. Again, it just seems to me like your wife is exhausted and maybe overwhelmed; it was the middle of the night, and emotions were high.

This is so out of the ordinary.\n\nThis is the part that makes me wonder if there's more context. I posted this elsewhere, but my 2-year had a brief phase where he had literal panic attacks in the middle of the night if his father went to him instead of me. If I went to him he'd calm down and back to sleep quickly, if his father did, it was about an hour to calm him down. It was just after I'd been in the hospital to have my second kid and then I had covid and was isolating, so I think it was a need to see me, specifically. If my husband knew that and set off a panic attack, I'd be annoyed too.\n\nSo my question is, is there something going on with the mom that she's this upset about something that she shouldn't be, or is there something that the Dad knows about/should know about or actively does and it made the situation worse?

If I am not missing something glaringly obvious then I\u2019m going with NTA and betting a lot of women wish their partners would do this!", "Is it possible she feels like you coming too is a judgement of her parenting? Like you don't trust her to handle it?", "NTA\n\nYour wife is being fucking ridiculous. When your kid is in distress, it doesn\u2019t matter which parent is being yelled for.", "Nta. My husband and I used to argue about who would get up because we wanted the OTHER to get some sleep.", "Wtf? NTA. I would LOVE if my partner let me relax to go tend to our kiddo, even if they are screaming \"mommy\". Why is your wife upset that you're being an involved parent??", "NTA", "NTA,  Super weird thing for your wife to be upset about.  If she wants to get up too nobody is stopping her.  Going and checking on the kids isn't some mutually exclusive thing where if one parent gets there first the other parent is prevented from being there.", "Jfc you are absolutely 100% NTA\u2026\n\nPlease let your wife read my comment \u201cI would have given ANYTHING to have my (now ex) husband go to our children in the middle of the night, even just once in a while. Instead he would literally shove me out of the bed to get them so his sleep wasn\u2019t disturbed\u201d \na child will be ok with the other parent running in when they scream for help, just gotta explain \u201care you ok? mommy(or daddy or whatever the parental term of choice is) is coming in right now, and she/he will help too\u201d\n\nHonestly your wife has me fucking livid right now, we got men out here who won\u2019t do a fucking thing for their children and she\u2019s mad at you for actively parenting your kid. \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12", "No way! I LOVE when my husband responds! Love, LOVE, LOVE! I get to stay in bed and go back to sleep.  Comforting a child isn't only mom's job.", "What the hell kind of argument is this?!? Regardless of who child calls for in the middle of the night the parent who gets there first deals with it. If our child asks for a specific parent again then that parent takes over. We communicate and we both do what we can to fix whatever issue has occurred. Why is this even an issue? Why is your wife making it an issue? NTA", "NTA.  The fact that you were willing to get up to check on your daughter was decent.  There are wives all over the world that would love to get an extra moment of shut eye and not have to get up. I don't know if it's jealousy or what, but your daughter is just as much your child as she is your wife's.  And if anyone ever told me that I can't go to comfort my kid, there'd be a big problem", "NAH. Y\u2019all are sleep deprived as hell. Been there.  You have to recognize that when you are that level of tired, you\u2019re gonna probably say some dumb stuff and maybe fight over some dumb stuff. You both gotta learn to just let it go when your exhausted spouse says some ridiculous stuff in the middle of the night when caring for waking children. Strive for grace under fire. \n\nTo your point, it probably doesn\u2019t matter who goes to care for the kid as long as they are cared for.", "No assholes here. She\u2019s coming from a place of love and some insecurity. I\u2019m glad you care enough to get up and take care of your kid. I\u2019m glad your wife values you enough to feel anxiety about you feeling rested for work. You sound like a loving team who just needs a bit more communication. You\u2019ve got this! NTA", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an intentional asshole. I think this is more a society pressure thing. She feels like she needs to be a mum during the weekend as you work and she doesn\u2019t atm. Society tells her/pressures her to feel like she needs to step up and be a 24/7 mum while you work all day", "This is not even worth questioning, too many factors: child\u2019s tone, habit of child (does this happen a lot), child\u2019s expectations, time of night ect ect. \nI would say in general it\u2019s fine for you to go to your daughter, I would also say there\u2019s no harm in communicating with the person in bed next to you. For my husband and I it\u2019s as simple as \u201cI\u2019ll go\u201d (or more likely \u201cyour turn\u201d", "NAH. I think that it's great that you want to be an active part of your children's lives. I also understand where she is coming from. \n\nWhen my one year old busted her lip falling down, I picked her up and was comforting her and my husband grabbed her from me( not mean just also worried) and I felt like he thought I couldn't handle comforting my own kid. I didn't get mad at him and we talked it out so we could avoid situations like that in the future but I could definitely see her side. \n\nKeep being a great active dad and just try to talk it out", "NAH, from your edit, you and your wife figured it out. My only complaint towards you would be be that you jumped on reddit before talking to your wife. You did what you should do as a father but you have a life outside of that. Your wife is currently a SAHM, so her life is limited to taking care of of children. Please talk things out before blasting it world-wide.", "NTA as written.  You use a lot of explaining though, which leads me to wonder if you are being one-sided, or leaving anything out.  Straighten this out asap.  Children learn familial politics quite young, and it is not fair that they need to.  I vividly remember calling for mom in the middle of the night,*knowing* it would be dad who came, but also knowing calling for him directly would cause problems.  That memory has to be 55 years old by now, and I resent it on behalf of my childhood self.", "NTA, but your wife isn't actually mad at you either. She's feeling inferior because you're doing her 'job'.  It may sound silly, but she's struggling with her role and feeling important, and when you can do your job and hers she feels unimportant and unneeded. She's lashing out at you, but it's not actually about you, it's about her own personal struggle and feelings of self worth.", "INFO: did you go over to help or to micromanage your wife helping?", "NTA and great job dad! You would be TA if you just rolled over and ignored your child. Did wife come check or was she pouting and busy planning the fight to actually go check on your child? What a selfish and horrible mom.", "Yeah, I occasionally got daddy after yelling for my mom. It was a nice surprise honestly, he was always calmer because he didn't deal with my shit 24/7 lol. He'd go get her if it was really a mom-only situation, of course. I bet OP would have too.", "Honestly, I'd say neither is an AH.\n\nI share parenting responsibilities with my partner and get that emotions can run high in times of distress, leading to some irrational thinking on the part of either parent at times. If the opinion doesn't last and you can talk it out, I'd call it a wash.", "My daughter was NOT a good sleeper. I think her infant-mind was convinced we were doing fun stuff when we left her in the crib in her room. She'd cry, and when we'd get her back to sleep, she'd stir and start up again at the first inkling of someone leaving the room.\n\nThough I wake easily, I also sleep easily, and my ex- was driving herself to a breakdown trying to comfort our daughter at the expense of her own needed sleep.\n\nI finally laid down the law and sidelined my ex- from any middle of the night daughter duty.  My arms were long enough and my pickiness about how I got my sleep was small enough that I could faceplant on a pillow on the carpet next to her crib and fall asleep with arm between the crib bars and my hand on her back. Problem solved.", "We didn't talk about such a situation before. But it was not a lack of sleep reaction either, since the argument was much later in the day.", "She has confirmed your theory.", "This was my first thought. You explained it well. This was my experience as a stay at home mom. There was also anxiety and guilt over leaving my profession to be a SAHM. Even though my husband was great I often felt like I needed to do more to \u201cpull my weight.\u201d \n\nThen there was the perception of others. People would make comments about me having it easy or talk about how hard he was working. If he mentioned being tired because he got up with the baby in front of someone else, I sometimes felt judged. Some of it was probably just my own insecurities but I can remember resenting his help because of perceived judgment by family members.", "It turns out that some of the theories here were correct and she thinks that on a weekday (or weeknight) taking care of the kids is her job so I'm rested for work. And my actions made it so she couldn't do her job.", "Mind you he\u2019d hear them before me because I was always exhausted because he didn\u2019t help and I\u2019d wake up ~because~ he shoved me roughly onto the floor.", "Happy cake day!", "I went over to help my daughter.", "> Did wife come check\n\nShe didn't, because she knows that I would come got her if it was serious.\n\n> What a selfish and horrible mom.\n\nWhile we do have some problems she is definitely not a horrible mom, she cares a lot about our kids and is a good mother who would do anything for her kids.", "Same. My husband didn't even know our 3yo still wakes up sometimes. He just sleeps right through it.", "Oh? Well then....I'm glad I wasn't crazy off with my theory, though I'm not glad there was a big fight. \ud83d\ude1e I sincerely hope you two will work it through since you both clearly love each other and your family. Best wishes. \u263a\ufe0f", "Because 99% of people who comment on these posts are here to vilify someone, they aren\u2019t here to be helpful or insightful.", "I can definitely understand this point of view.  I am the stay-at-home parent and at times not bringing in an income, feeling Like I'm not financially contributing, makes the work at home feel more like this is a job I must do to carry my weight.\n\nInstead of the satisfaction and taking care of the family that loves me.", "not to point any fingers, as i think op isn\u2019t in the worng at all, but if a baby ends up being abused in any way it is most always someone who is close to the baby. obviously i don\u2019t think op would do that, he clearly loves his kids, i just wanted to clarify some things.", "That would make this situation 100% worse, and would make her a massive asshole for putting that on her husband.", "I can certainly see how that could be triggering and I have trauma myself so I get what its like but surely you either trust your husband not to SA your child or you divorce him? Stopping him from checking on his own daughter sounds like a way to make his relationship with her worse not better. If she had an abusive relationship with her father for example then in a (much smaller) way she is continuing the cycle by creating another strained relationship for her daughter with her father by not letting him be a dad.", "Thank you!", "My daughter was sitting on the couch watching TV with dad and came to me to ask for a snack. I was in the shower! I handed her the shampoo bottle and told her to enjoy. She handed it back and said she would just ask daddy instead.", "Absolutely not.", "NAH what you have is a miscommunication. It\u2019s ok for you get up to your daughter calling mommy and it\u2019s ok for your wife to feel like she wants her daughter to know if she calls for her she will come.", "No assholes here. She wanted you well rested for work. As a worker who gets up before dawn, I get that a good night's sleep is important. However, you were being a dad. I'm not a parent, but I do understand that you were just helping her. Was she raised to believe that women watched the kids while the men just didn't parent their kids or something?", "Right? I the question was supposed to be \u201cAITA for *not* getting up to see what\u2019s wrong with my child in the middle of the night instead of my wife\u201d.\n\nThis guy is asking if he\u2019s the asshole for *checks notes acting like a parent?", "After seeing @op's edits, I'm going to say wife is feeling insecure, not being an AH. She is feeling like she isn't pulling her wait and worried @op doesn't value her/her contributions. I think couples' counseling to work on communication would be a good idea. Don't wait until it becomes a problem", "Reread it and read his comments. It seems like she was on her way to handle it, and he rushed in there to get to the daughter first. At least that's the impression he is giving me", "It turns out that some of the theories here were correct and she thinks that on a weekday (or weeknight) taking care of the kids is her job so I'm rested for work. And my actions made it so she couldn't do her job. She will be back at work when the young one starts kindergarden in the fall.", "Can confirm. Was infant.", "I'm pretty tired of seeing \"I can't believe this comment that is 15 minutes old doesn't have more up votes!\"", "Funny how every possibility you conjured up in some way either pinned blame on him or reduced blame on her.\n\nAnd even if she did have a mental illness, it doesn't excuse her behaviour and in this scenario she is at fault", "Yes it does lol. That's why \"INFO\" even became a vote; it's common for people to want to know more of the story and often make wild assumptions about commenters, even when the demographics vary or are left out entirely.\n\nFunnily enough, many people in this thread have said there has to be more to the story for the wife to be so upset about something that most would be happy for (including wondering about her mental health, PPD, childhood, etc.), and the assumption that they all must be an accusation against the husband is just confirmation bias.", "I agree with you that it\u2019s probably not malicious, but I get nervous when the sub plays armchair psychiatrist about serious medical conditions. PPD affects one in seven women. Lack of sleep affects every new parent.", "Facts. Lol she has it good and doesn\u2019t realize it lol"]}
