He drives his bike for 20kms daily and isn't concerned about fuel but wants my scooter to drive for 2kms. He also does not share any of his stuff not that I ask him too either.

It\u2019s not your fault that he chose the less economical to drive version, he had options.  Sounds like he wanted the faster/sexier version and has discovered it has drawbacks.", "NTA \n\nYou are absolutely not the asshole in this situation. Your parents bought you an electric scooter specifically for your needs, and they even offered to buy your brother an electric bike, but he insisted on getting a fuel bike instead. It's clear that you have been reluctant but still shared your scooter with him for a long time, which shows your willingness to be accommodating.\n\nYour brother's constant requests to use your scooter for short distances, even when his bike is perfectly functional, is unreasonable and selfish. It's understandable that your scooter holds significant value for you, serving as both a means of transportation and a personal space. \n\nFurthermore, your brother's refusal to share any of his belongings while expecting you to share your scooter demonstrates a clear double standard. It's not fair for him to expect you to constantly give in and accommodate his desires while he doesn't reciprocate.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA- Walking to the gym would be a great warm up exercise for him.", "NTA. He has his own vehicle that he chose for himself. If he can use his bike 20 km on a daily basis, he can use it for the extra 2 km to go the gym. If he really doesn\u2019t want to take his bike he can walk imo."]}
