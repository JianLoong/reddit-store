It has been a rough year for both of us so we just wanted to enjoy ourselves. As soon as the concert started, we both stood up and started dancing (very badly) along with a lot of other people around us. After the first song, a man next to us asked if we were going to be standing up all night because he couldn't see. He refused to stand up because 'he had paid for the seat to sit in it' and told us to stop dancing and be seated for the rest of the show. My dad, who was probably a bit tipsy at the time, ignored him and continued standing up and dancing, causing the guy to loudly complain about us to those nearby.. I felt bad so I sat down for a couple songs but, with convincing from my dad, I got up again for the rest of the show and really enjoyed myself. The man eventually stood up for a couple of the more popular songs but I think we drove him away - halfway through the show, he left and never came back.\n\nI can see both sides. On the one hand, it must have been very frustrating to not be able to see the stage properly and it was his choice to remain seated if he didn't want to stand. On the other hand, he went to a stadium rock gig and somehow didn't expect people to stand up. Almost everyone else around us was doing the exact same thing. I feel like it was a poor decision to sit at the back if he was so concerned about people ruining his view.\n\nThere was also another guy behind us who told us at the start that his young son, who was sat at the back with headphones in, also couldn't see. I was told that after a while the kid stood on his seat and could see but I still feel awful for that, especially because the father was quite polite about it.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: For everyone saying that we should have bought standing tickets, this was not possible as that section was sold out. Same goes for the people saying that the man may have been disabled and should have bought disabled tickets, I have no idea if that was possible or not", "created_utc": 1687337975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14f2c4h/aita_for_not_sitting_down_at_a_concert/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They should be able to enjoy the concert from their seats. \n\nYou booked in a seated section.\n\nThe fact that other people around your were selfish AHs doesn't make you less of one.", "YTA. Not everyone is fit enough to stand all night and that's why they choose seats in a stadium instead of arena-tickets. Be considerate.", "YTA .. you have payed for a seat ticket as well as the person behind you. You are standing up and there for forcing the people behind you to also stand up, forcing people behind them to also stand up. This continues all the way. The person behind you also payed the same amount as you did. What gives you more right to ruin their night? Its a reason they are called seat tickets.", "YTA. Someone had a nearly identical post about a week or so ago but it was a Stevie Nicks/Billy Joel show and OP was with her mother. And it's the same answer: Read the room; if you are seated in a seated area and you decide tipsy dancing is the way to go, don't be surprised when people who want to watch the concert ask you and your tipsy daddy to stop blocking their view.", "YTA. I'm not disabled, but I have a badly arthritic knees, cannot stand for long periods. my knee swells like a grapefruit and is sore for a day or 2 when I do. I'd be pissed if some jerks in front of me were standing and dancing lamely for an entire show (Muse, no less!), when I'm in a seated section.\n\nshow some consideration. you and your dad are TAs.", "YTA - And so is your dad.  You paid for SEATS, not a private dance area.  \n\nYou are both inconsiderate AHs who ruined the experience for those seated behind you.", "I don\u2019t blame anyone for getting up and dancing, even in the seating section. A bit obnoxious? Perhaps. But harmless if the people around you -including, nay, **especially** behind- don\u2019t mind. \n\nGetting up if the people behind you are staying seated without asking them if they mind before doing it is a dick-ish move, but so far not entirely into AH territory as long as you comply if they ask you to sit. \n\nBut when the person behind you asks you to sit *in the seated area* so they can also enjoy the show, not sitting and not even offering to switch seat with them make YTA. This is basic decency. They paid to be in the seated area, they should be allowed to sit. \n\nThe fact that the standing area was sold-out isn\u2019t a good excuse, bud. That\u2019s on you for not being quick enough. Be considerate, sit down and suck it up or find another solution so you can dance without blocking them.", "Personally, I've always been of the opinion that when you buy a SEAT..... You SIT in it. If you want to dance and enjoy yourself, purchase a lawn seat/general admission seat/whatever it's called where you don't get a seat. Especially when you standing prevents others in their seats from sitting. \n\nNAH (only because it is sadly generally accepted to stand even when you have a seat)", "YTA (if someone has a specific need to be seated the whole time and asks you to sit so that you can all enjoy the show, you should sit). However, all the people acting like \"seated concert tickets only exist because people want to sit the entire time\" is some universally accepted fact are way off base.", "YTA. \n\nYou bought seated - stay seated. Those arguing it\u2019s a rock concert - doesn\u2019t matter what sort of concert it is. \nI\u2019m actually a rock fan - and like Muse. But I\u2019m also disabled. I use crutches so have a bit more flexibility than people with other mobility impairments so if there\u2019s someone I really want to see and some of the VERY FEW accessible seats are unavailable, I ask to be allocated somewhere in seating with minimal steps etc. \n\nChair dancing is a thing!", ">  For everyone saying that we should have bought standing tickets, this was not possible as that section was sold out\n\nSo you bought tickets for a seated area, and stood throughout the concert. I would be a hypocrite if I said YTA as I have done the same thing at football matches, but the guy who said he paid for a seated ticket in a seated area did have a point.", "YTA. There\u2019s a reason they sell 2 types of tickets. Standing and seated. Why did you buy seated when you were going to be standing?", "YTA. Having a hard year doesn't give you a pass to be a jerk. Asshole.", "Yta. You bought seated. So did everyone else and multiple people said they couldn't see because of you both.", "NAH - I know they were seated tickets but at a rock gig you cannot expect everyone to sit down for the whole show.

Why not \"sit and be fit\" dance. It's not like you can't sway/headbang in your seat.  Half the time, I just see people tapping their foot and random fist bumps; that can all be done while sitting! With that being said, if everyone in front of you is standing too it would have fucked you over anyway. Basically, anyone standing in the front of a seated section is the asshole cause everyone has to stand then.", "YTA\n\nwow. lots of people who get sitting tickets (eg myself) get them because they are unable to stand up for that period of time. you were inconsiderate to those around you, disabled or not. \n\nwell done for possibly ruining the concert for others.", "YTA, just because you couldn't get standing tickets, doesn't give you the right to ruin the experience for others who also paid their tickets. It's one thing if you stand up every now and then to give standing applause or whatever with the rest of the crowd. But to stand throughout in a seated area is an a-hole move.", "This might not go over well, but majority of the concerts I've been too where there are seats...most people stand.  It depends on the artist whether their music is inclined to sitting.  I mean I wouldn't stand at a symphony, but Muse?  Yeah I would.  Even in the nosebleeds, this seems to me as a common concert behavior for that genre of music.\n\nI mean you were probably an AH to the guy behind you, but to the general concert population you were just enjoying yourself.", "NTA I don't think anyone who voted Y T A has actually ever been to a rock show in their entire lives.  I have been to countless shows in the last 30+ years and of all the venues I have ever been to the only one that people sat through the entire shows were at Red Rocks Amphitheater other then that at ever one the audience stood.  It like complaining about people singing at a concert.", "I would go on the general vibe. Like if only a few people in the seated area are standing then YTA but if literally everyone is up on their feet then NTA. I've been to concerts where people were standing most of the time even in the seated section.", "NTA but leaning also towards NAH. Standing at a concert is definitely expected, and if everyone is standing up around you and you sit down then you can\u2019t see either. On the other hand, the people sitting paid for seats and there could be any number of reasons, possibly he isn\u2019t able to stand for a long time hence why he bought seats. If you want to stand, maybe buy floor tickets next time.", "YTA, I get standing to clap etc, but if it\u2019s specifically a seated section\u2026. Then it\u2019s that way for a reason. The standing area being sold out is a you problem, don\u2019t make it everyone else\u2019s problem.", "NTA There are many things at rock concerts you would like not to happen. Unfortunately, you need to learn to accept it and not let it spoil your enjoyment.\n\nPeople standing is normal and the least of your worries.", "YTA\n\nEspecially you dad. Not sure how much life experience you've had but he will have had more than enough to know there are hundreds of different medical reasons why people can't stand for long periods of time, so have to get seated seats. Disabled seating is usually for people medical aids.\n\nShame on him for teaching you to be selfish and ableist.", "NTA Everyone stands at concerts, I cannot believe this comment thread is so full of people saying you\u2019re the Asshole.  Have none of them ever been to a concert?  I\u2019ve literally never been to a show where the vast majority of the crowd wasn\u2019t standing for most of the show.  This is crazy.", "NTA.  I\u2019ve been in this position.  Everyone standing, we stood, and the couple in back asked us to sit.  We sit and can\u2019t see anything because everyone is standing.  We stand again at a stirring moment and they are tapping our shoulders again.  We sit again. Another concert goer threatens to fight the seated couple because by insisting we sit, he feels they are disrespecting his rock idol.  I try to convince them not to fight.  Eventually we just stand and ignore them. They leave.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nYou chose seated tickets and blocked the view of other people who wanted to remain seated.", "YTA.

So no verdict here.\n\nYes, you had a seat which you can utilize. At the same time however you are perfectly okay to stand if there is no rule against it. \n\nTo be honest I think the people who miss out most in these scenarios are kids as they smaller.
