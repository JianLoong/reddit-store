We just wanted to enjoy ourselves. As soon as the concert started, we both stood up and started dancing (very badly) along with a lot of other people around us. After the first song, a man next to us asked if we were going to be standing up all night because he couldn't see. He refused to stand up because 'he had paid for the seat to sit in it' and told us to stop dancing and be seated for the rest of the show. My dad, who was probably a bit tipsy at the time, ignored him and continued standing up and dancing, causing the guy to loudly complain about us to those nearby.. I felt bad so I sat down for a couple songs but, with convincing from my dad, I got up again for the rest of the show and really enjoyed myself. The man eventually stood up for a couple of the more popular songs but I think we drove him away - halfway through the show, he left and never came back.\n\nI can see both sides. On the one hand, it must have been very frustrating to not be able to see the stage properly and it was his choice to remain seated if he didn't want to stand. On the other hand, he went to a stadium rock gig and somehow didn't expect people to stand up. Almost everyone else around us was doing the exact same thing. I feel like it was a poor decision to sit at the back if he was so concerned about people ruining his view.\n\nThere was also another guy behind us who told us at the start that his young son, who was sat at the back with headphones in, also couldn't see. I was told that after a while the kid stood on his seat and could see but I still feel awful for that, especially because the father was quite polite about it.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: For everyone saying that we should have bought standing tickets, this was not possible as that section was sold out. Same goes for the people saying that the man may have been disabled and should have bought disabled tickets, I have no idea if that was possible or not", "created_utc": 1687337975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14f2c4h/aita_for_not_sitting_down_at_a_concert/", "score": 3020, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Most of the venues I\u2019ve gone to though you were able to sit down and still see the screens because of the way seating was made.

Also I\u2019m sure that at a MUSE concert everyone is vibing along and dancing or sitting to their liking.

This sub is so biased against reality.", "NTA. It's pretty usual to stand at a stadium rock concert. Now, I also don't hold with the idea that it's *rude* to the musicians to sit--and I've seen that idea floated around--but you go there with the expectation that lots of people will stand, even if you have seats.", "NTA. \n\nIt's a rock concert, not a theater play.", "WTF?

Usually I\u2019ll see people randomly sit down for a song or two (myself included), but doesn\u2019t standing up to sing and dance with the performer come along with enjoying the show?  Even when you watch a recording of a concert, you don\u2019t see many sitting down!  Honestly if the guy doesn\u2019t want those around him standing up he can buy extra tickets to be sure he has a radius to exclude those having fun.  Plus, if you do sit down, then generally you cannot see because EVERYONE else is standing!  \n\nI\u2019m guessing all of those voting Y T A are the ones who also go to a concert expecting everyone to sit down because THEY personally don\u2019t want to stand up to enjoy the show.

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills reading all the YTA. First of all I can't even imagine seeing Muse and sitting for the show, it'd be a new form of torture. Secondly, these people clearly don't go to high energy concerts much. Everyone stands. I've been to hundreds of concerts, people sit for mellow acoustic sessions, orchestra music, not rock concerts. Third!So many venues only have a few hundred standing tickets  and thousands of \"seats\". They're just trying to fill the stadium not dictate that you have to sit. \n\nThe responses have to be a joke.

I go to tons of concerts of all genres, as well as sporting events, and I'm pretty tall, so I over-think this a lot. I try to do what everyone else is doing. If other people are standing at a seated event, it's fair game. I avoid being the only one standing. If people in front of me are standing, I definitely stand. I've been in the front row at a show where I wanted to stand and dance, but literally not another person in the place would stand up, so I sadly sat and enjoyed the show anyway. For Muse, standing would feel wrong. Stadiums are enormous, people can re-locate themselves if you're bothering them.\n\nNAH", "Get standing tickets if you want to stand, if those are sold out your options are either to be respectful and sit down or you stand in an aisle or something so you at least don't ruin the show for everyone else.

I'll repeat what I said last time: some people have hidden disabilities, they can't stand up even if they want to. \n\nYou mention the child was wearing headphones, did you ever try to analyse why? Do you think he just wore them cause he wasn't interested in the concert? I can guarantee you that kid has a sensitivity and wanted to enjoy the concert from his seat, in peace, in his own way which was sat at the seat he paid for. \n\nI have various diagnosed conditions that stop me from being able to stand for more than a couple minutes at a time, even when sat I'm in severe pain most of the time but I live a normal life, work, go out and look well, you would not be able to tell this tall, young woman sitting behind you asking you to please sit because she wants to watch a concert is actually suffering from herniated discs, lordosis, scoliosis, kyphosis, modic changes in plates, spinal tears, endometriosis, adenomyosis, abdominal nerve + muscular damages and IBD-colitis. All of which do NOT qualify as official disabilities so I can't buy disabled tickets. \n\nAnd to be honest even if that kid or the man beat you didn't have similar issues, they bought seated tickets expecting to be able to watch the concert sat, period. You weren't able to buy standing tickets, you tried them first, they were sold out, so I assume your intention all along was to stand up? They bought seated tickets because their intention was to sit down. Understanding this is the key here, being considerate of others and their rights is very basic commonsense and I see your father has very little therefore he's not passing them down to you as he should. \n\nBe better next time? Buy tickets where you truly want to be or get another date, or don't go at all. I'm always telling my children this: when you go to church, you behave like you're I'm church. When you go to school you behave like you're in school, at the beach, wear beach clothes and play and run and act like you're at the beach. At a club, party away. At the supermarket? Act like you're shopping for groceries. Get the gist? At a concert? Got floor tickets: stand and dance the night away, got seated tickets? You know what to do!", "YTA... he asked politely.  I had bad knees before my knee replacement surgery and I could not have stood that long.   It was beyond rude after he asked.  You were asked by multiple people and you didn't care.

I buy seated tickets for concerts because I am barely 5 feet tall. Pretty much everyone in the world is taller than me (yes I\u2019m exaggerating) so if I\u2019m in a seated area and the person in front of me stands, even if I also stand then I still can\u2019t see!

I understand there could possibly be mobility issues for people, but a gig is a gig. You stand up and dance.

As soon as the show started the people in the seated area stood. We had no choice but to stand (stadium seating and cramped). One of my friends is a double above the knee amputee with prosthetics.

But it is really a matter of how the crowd acts: if it is a quiet moment and everyone is sitting down, a lone guy staying up and dancing may get some remarks from the people behind him. There is like a implicit rule that standing up and dancing is tolerated during upbeat songs and if all people around do it as well, and that it is the normal thing to sit down during quieter songs or when waiting for the encore. You have to \"feel\" the room, it really depends on the genre: I have seen Agnes Obel and everyone was seated, I have seen Faithless and I can't imagine there was a single person still sitting in their seat after the first song.\n\nBest moment: I was at a concert of Kasabian, in the standing area, and after their first song, the singer shouted at the people in the seats \"hey you over there, c'mon, stand up !

In places where standing is the norm the seated sections are for the _option_ of sitting.

We usually have a standing area for those wanting to stand and a seated area where people actually sit. And for those saying that people with disabilities can sit at a designted area, there are way to few seats like that and if you are lucky enough to get one they usually have limits of 1 person that can sit with them. That means that they could not go enjoy the concert with a friend group, just one person. \n\nI saw a video clip from an American tv show laughing at people in Stockholm staying seated in the seated section of a Beyonc\u00e9 concert. Americans in the comment section seemed to find it weird, but it's not weird to a Scandinavian. Buy standing if you want to stand, sit in the seated section.", "100% agreed. Muse especially is high energy constantly so everyone is standing and dancing. A rock concert is not one you sit and be quiet to. These people have never been to a concert.", "This must be a subreddit of people who have never been to a concert at a stadium. People stand and dance at concerts, those seats are usually uncomfortable AF and built for short people! If there is a standing area, it's usually expensive to be there, and any seated areas you really can't see much on the stage anyway unless you brought binoculars. It's music, the most important part is what hits your ears.", "I was just at a stadium concert on the weekend - nearly everyone around us was standing. Those who weren\u2019t, didn\u2019t seem to be bothered. If it\u2019s a high energy show, people aren\u2019t sitting for that. I sat  down for a couple songs and wasn\u2019t going to complain that the people in front of me were standing. \n\nNTA, that\u2019s how concerts work. You go expecting people to stand and dance.", "I have mobility issues and can't stand for periods of time without becoming painful. It blows me away how many people feel SOO entitled.

I am not sure why but I have been yelled at at every show I have ever been to for standing.. It does not matter the genre of music.  If you want to sit and listen purchase a CD.", "I'm confused, too. Most concerts with seats are stadium seats? Like, I saw Green Day at a baseball stadium and stood the whole time because they're stadium seats. Do you watch a sport live and complain that people need to sit down and cheer a play? Mind boggling.\n\nEven floor seats, you're gonna stand since it's just the pit experience with assigned seating lol\n\nIf you can't stand you get accessible seating that has clear views at the tops of sections, otherwise you don't complain.\n\nNTA, op.", "Exactly. Even when I have paid seats in an arena, I know what's going to happen as soon as the main act comes out (if not sooner). I begrudge nobody for standing and enjoying the music! \n\nWhile I may be less energetic as I've gotten older about standing and dancing in crowded spaces for hours, that's the vibe of live music and if I wanted to avoid that, I wouldn't go to a concert in the first place. It comes with the territory!", "I agree. In an ideal situation everyone would stay seated the whole time, but that's not happening at any type of rock concert. It should be expected when buying the ticket", "Agreed. I prefer to sit.  So I buy tickets in the front row of the higher up/cheap sections. Everyone else can dance and enjoy, and I can still see.", "I\u2019m amazed! Like who goes to a concert and doesn\u2019t dance? I get people with disabilities but still, crazy all the Y T A comments. I m in europe and every concert I\u2019ve been to people sit until the performers come out.", "Seriously! The bands that I go see would be pretty bummed if the audience just sat calmly in their seats during the show. That\u2019s not the reaction that they want from a crowd.", "I understand where they're coming from. I am a person with mobility issues who can't stand for long but at the end of the day, my problems are not other's, people have bought tickets and are well within their rights to enjoy themselves. Not everyone can afford the tickets in the standing sections, seated are the most affordable and often, standing sells out within seconds. Front row gives you an unobstructed view, but again, availability is limited as well as affordability.\n\nWhen I was more able-bodied, I stood for almost an entire Paramore concert in the seated section (seat breaks for pain). Other concert-goers are not responsible for the inaccessibility of concerts, particularly the venues.

I go to concerts multiple times a month and no one is sitting in the areas with seats aside from the ADA sections. \n\nAlso, you typically have no other choice than seats in venues. The standing only section is considerably smaller and sells out immediately. Have you never been to a concert before?", "Ffs, this is a rock show, not an opera or orchestra.", "It's a stadium. There were probably 1000 standing tickets and 10000 seats. How many stadium concerts have you been to? Most people stand at their seats.", "No, no, no.  I have been to over 100 concerts.  From big names like Paul McCartney, ZZ Top, Rush, Rolling Stones, REO, The Who, etc., etc. to small acts like Bedford Band, Dirty Honey, Levon, etc., to middle of the road groups.  People stand at ALL of them.  Have you not noticed that the FRONT row fans stand for nearly the entire show at every rock concert in every venue.  If the first row stands, guess what, ripple effect.  I was in the lower arena at a Clapton show in the 4th row of seats.  The first 3 rows were standing, so of course I and my date stood.  The people behind me were screaming at me to sit down.  It was funny because you could only hear them between songs due to the volume of the band.  I was in the 6th row floor for REO right behind the wheel chair row.  There was around an eight foot gap between the wheel chair row and the first 4 rows for maneuverability.  The person in the wheel chair called over an usher and asked them to tell people in the FRONT rows to sit down so they could see better.  The usher politely, but immediately said, \"No Way\", this is a rock concert, people are allowed to stand and rock.   OP is NTA.", "Have you ever go to a concert?

Wouldn\u2019t be stood up from start to finish either, just alternating because some songs you\u2019ll enjoy more than others.\n\nI mean, if you were standing and the people in front were too tall, you wouldn\u2019t get mad at them, you\u2019d move somewhere with more visibility or ask to squeeze in front.", "Yeah so weird.

Some shows have a standing room only space (aka, the pit) at the front near the stage, which is general admission and no seats. This will depend on the show itself, some bands lend themselves more for that sort of thing. \n\nSmaller venues (like under 2K people): standing room only and general admission, you'd better get there early if you want to be near the front. If there are assigned seats they're going to be in a balcony. \n\nOutdoor venue: Assigned seats up close, and then a whole big general admission area in the back. Usually on a slight hill. Again, better get there early  and stake out a spot if you don't want to be at the very back.  They don't even assign sections in the general admission space, it's a free for all. \n\nI've been pretty much only buying assigned seats since my late 20s, I don't want to deal with the general admission seating anymore, and I've been kicked in the face more than once in the mosh pit.

Crouch in their seat?\n\nI'd say NAH because I don't blame the guy behind OP for being upset that he couldn't see, but even if OP had sat down, it wouldn't have helped because *most people around them were also standing*! All the Y T A votes seem to conveniently overlook that if OP had sat down, they wouldn't be able to see either.

(it was the Grace Under Pressure tour)\n\nIt was in what would now be a small-medium arena, and we had seats on the side where every row from front to back was higher than the one in front of it. Standing in your seat would barely block the person behind you. They'd just have to lean a bit but could still see. \n\nMy ex was drunk, because he felt that attending anything special like a concert was a waste if you weren't inebriated in some way. And that statement alone should also tell you he was an asshole.\n\nWe sat down in our seats and the people in front of us were up dancing like 90% of everybody there. My ex tapped the guy on the shoulder and told him to \"sit the fuck down.\" The guy shrugged off his hand and told him to fuck off.

Immediately he redirected his anger at me, grabbed my arm, and dragged me out of our seats and up to the next riser.

Stay and see the concert, which would have either ended the relationship if he left, or he would have come back every 10 minutes to argue with me to make sure I didn't enjoy the show. I didn't drive (yet) and had no money on me. This was before cell phones, and even before ATM machines were a thing.

Only concerts where you should only be seated should be classical pieces \u00af\u2060\\\u2060_\u2060(\u2060\u30c4\u2060)\u2060_\u2060/\u2060\u00af", "England, and yes, pretty much.", "I mean, until they go to OP\u2019s seats and the people directly in front of OP are also standing \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "ITT: people who either A-don't go to concerts or B-listen to really boring, uninteresting and/or snooty music", "Some people, like my boyfriend, have mobility problems.

In addition to his age, he was in early remission at the time and we knew he'd want to sit while others were likely to stand. So we got him front row balcony seats.  He could sit and still see even if those next to/behind him could stand and dance. Worked out great.\n\nCaveat: we could afford to splurge - this isn't an option for most people especially the way concert tickets are sold nowadays.", "I've been to two Slipknot concerts in Stockholm and we stayed seated the whole time.

I'm Polish. But to each their own, there should be both options available, and special sections for sitting and standing (which I guess is usually the case). Although during most concerts I've been to (Poland, Germany, Czech Republic) people in the sitting area still stand up and dance. I believe it's a regional thing.\nI could sit during a classical music concert but chances of me going to one are pretty low.", "I have been to 5 Green Day concerts, all in Sweden or Denmark and everyone has been standing at all of them, even in the seated section. So I have no idea what Concerts you have been to where people are all sitting in the seated section.", "Yep, that\u2019s been my experience as well. My mom is in her 70s and has issues with standing and climbing stairs but doesn\u2019t use a medical mobility aid. She has a handicap placard for her car but parking is about all it\u2019s good for.

We are very lowkey and if you're the only one dancing and screaming around, it's seen extremely rude.

Not to mention that even just in a normal setting, we generally find Americans quite loud lol.\n\nPeople commenting how they would never want to visit a concert like that, great, then don't go to Sweden.

I went to a concert last year where almost no one in the balcony was standing (maybe 5%) but the woman in front of me stood the entire time. I have a disability that prevents standing for more than a few minutes at a time, so I barely saw a thing the whole night. The woman\u2019s boyfriend was sitting next to her the whole concert.

I am not legally disabled, so that is no help. I guess that means I can never purchase a seat to watch anything because people can just stand and block my view if they feel like it. I would suggest that next time buy the tickets in the standing section quicker. I am going to leave the Judgement blank, but hopefully I gave you something to think about.", "YTA.

The standing area is usually a tiny area right in front of the stage (usually only holds a few hundred people and ends up being the most expensive) and the entire rest of the multi-thousand seat arena is seating. At a rock concert, where the energy is high and dancing is encouraged, it's not reasonable to expect only the lucky/privileged 5% who managed to get a GA ticket to dance and everyone else to sit there. The band doesn't want that either. \n\nCulturally, at least here, at a stadium rock concert you expect that everyone around you will be standing and it's your choice to join them or accept that you won't have a clear line of sight.

Usually you also need to go down stairs to access the regular seats, so the disabled seating would not require that. All you'd have to do is contact guest services for the stadium. By law they can't charge more for disabled seats as they would for any other seat.\n\nAlso, as someone who goes to a lot of festivals/raves, I've seen people in wheelchairs in the GA having the time of their lives without being able to see the stage.
