We just wanted to enjoy ourselves. As soon as the concert started, we both stood up and started dancing (very badly) along with a lot of other people around us. After the first song, a man next to us asked if we were going to be standing up all night because he couldn't see. He refused to stand up because 'he had paid for the seat to sit in it' and told us to stop dancing and be seated for the rest of the show. My dad, who was probably a bit tipsy at the time, ignored him and continued standing up and dancing, causing the guy to loudly complain about us to those nearby.. I felt bad so I sat down for a couple songs but, with convincing from my dad, I got up again for the rest of the show and really enjoyed myself. The man eventually stood up for a couple of the more popular songs but I think we drove him away - halfway through the show, he left and never came back.\n\nI can see both sides. On the one hand, it must have been very frustrating to not be able to see the stage properly and it was his choice to remain seated if he didn't want to stand. On the other hand, he went to a stadium rock gig and somehow didn't expect people to stand up. Almost everyone else around us was doing the exact same thing. I feel like it was a poor decision to sit at the back if he was so concerned about people ruining his view.\n\nThere was also another guy behind us who told us at the start that his young son, who was sat at the back with headphones in, also couldn't see. I was told that after a while the kid stood on his seat and could see but I still feel awful for that, especially because the father was quite polite about it.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: For everyone saying that we should have bought standing tickets, this was not possible as that section was sold out. Same goes for the people saying that the man may have been disabled and should have bought disabled tickets, I have no idea if that was possible or not", "created_utc": 1687337975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14f2c4h/aita_for_not_sitting_down_at_a_concert/", "score": 466, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Someone had a nearly identical post about a week or so ago but it was a Stevie Nicks/Billy Joel show and OP was with her mother.

It\u2019s a concert. I\u2019ve been to 4 concerts in my life and in every single one I\u2019ve ended up standing for most of it. Always up in the nosebleed section but everyone around me would be standing and dancing so I would too so I could see better. Most of the venues I\u2019ve gone to though you were able to sit down and still see the screens because of the way seating was made.

Also I\u2019m sure that at a MUSE concert everyone is vibing along and dancing or sitting to their liking.

This sub is so biased against reality.", "NTA. It's pretty usual to stand at a stadium rock concert. Now, I also don't hold with the idea that it's *rude* to the musicians to sit--and I've seen that idea floated around--but you go there with the expectation that lots of people will stand, even if you have seats.", "NTA. \n\nIt's a rock concert, not a theater play.", "WTF?

Even when you watch a recording of a concert, you don\u2019t see many sitting down!  Honestly if the guy doesn\u2019t want those around him standing up he can buy extra tickets to be sure he has a radius to exclude those having fun.  Plus, if you do sit down, then generally you cannot see because EVERYONE else is standing!  \n\nI\u2019m guessing all of those voting Y T A are the ones who also go to a concert expecting everyone to sit down because THEY personally don\u2019t want to stand up to enjoy the show.

I go to tons of concerts of all genres, as well as sporting events, and I'm pretty tall, so I over-think this a lot. I try to do what everyone else is doing. If other people are standing at a seated event, it's fair game. I avoid being the only one standing. If people in front of me are standing, I definitely stand. I've been in the front row at a show where I wanted to stand and dance, but literally not another person in the place would stand up, so I sadly sat and enjoyed the show anyway. For Muse, standing would feel wrong. Stadiums are enormous, people can re-locate themselves if you're bothering them.\n\nNAH", "Get standing tickets if you want to stand, if those are sold out your options are either to be respectful and sit down or you stand in an aisle or something so you at least don't ruin the show for everyone else.

I'll repeat what I said last time: some people have hidden disabilities, they can't stand up even if they want to. \n\nYou mention the child was wearing headphones, did you ever try to analyse why? Do you think he just wore them cause he wasn't interested in the concert? I can guarantee you that kid has a sensitivity and wanted to enjoy the concert from his seat, in peace, in his own way which was sat at the seat he paid for. \n\nI have various diagnosed conditions that stop me from being able to stand for more than a couple minutes at a time, even when sat I'm in severe pain most of the time but I live a normal life, work, go out and look well, you would not be able to tell this tall, young woman sitting behind you asking you to please sit because she wants to watch a concert is actually suffering from herniated discs, lordosis, scoliosis, kyphosis, modic changes in plates, spinal tears, endometriosis, adenomyosis, abdominal nerve + muscular damages and IBD-colitis. All of which do NOT qualify as official disabilities so I can't buy disabled tickets. \n\nAnd to be honest even if that kid or the man beat you didn't have similar issues, they bought seated tickets expecting to be able to watch the concert sat, period. You weren't able to buy standing tickets, you tried them first, they were sold out, so I assume your intention all along was to stand up? They bought seated tickets because their intention was to sit down. Understanding this is the key here, being considerate of others and their rights is very basic commonsense and I see your father has very little therefore he's not passing them down to you as he should. \n\nBe better next time? Buy tickets where you truly want to be or get another date, or don't go at all. I'm always telling my children this: when you go to church, you behave like you're I'm church. When you go to school you behave like you're in school, at the beach, wear beach clothes and play and run and act like you're at the beach. At a club, party away. At the supermarket? Act like you're shopping for groceries. Get the gist? At a concert? Got floor tickets: stand and dance the night away, got seated tickets? You know what to do!", "YTA... he asked politely.  I had bad knees before my knee replacement surgery and I could not have stood that long.   It was beyond rude after he asked.  You were asked by multiple people and you didn't care.

I buy seated tickets for concerts because I am barely 5 feet tall.

I understand there could possibly be mobility issues for people, but a gig is a gig. You stand up and dance.

I can understand when it's someone using their phone in a restaurant but wanting to immortalise something is not evil. \n\nIt's only natural to want to relive a moment where we were happy and experiencing something we enjoyed. A concert or a festival are rare events and therefore worthy of being filmed, I don't understand the need to piss all over people's happiness with judgement. The downvotes are telling me I'm very unpopular for this though lmao", "I don't know about the punk scene, but many rock and metal fans are elderly these days and at ever non-festival concert I've been to, if there are seating sections, you sit. There's usually a floor with a mosh pit you can go to if you want, though you should've probably booked a standing ticket, but the chairs are for sitting in. Arena chairs aren't even safe to dance in, the floor space is too narrow and the fall would be steep and break a lot of peoples necks.", "> But if it had electrical guitars in it I would not expect a view while sitting in a chair. Not even in a sitting section.\n\nI went to see Trans-Siberian Orchestra and everyone sat. Same for \"Weird Al\" Yankovic.", "European here (Belgian, specifically) and avid rock fan: I have been to countless rock/pop concerts, sometimes in the seats area, and at least here, there is always a moment where, after a few songs, most attendees will stand up and dance and cheer along until the end. It would then be absurd for someone to argue they have paid for a seat and ask the other people to sit down. But it is really a matter of how the crowd acts: if it is a quiet moment and everyone is sitting down, a lone guy staying up and dancing may get some remarks from the people behind him. There is like a implicit rule that standing up and dancing is tolerated during upbeat songs and if all people around do it as well, and that it is the normal thing to sit down during quieter songs or when waiting for the encore. You have to \"feel\" the room, it really depends on the genre: I have seen Agnes Obel and everyone was seated, I have seen Faithless and I can't imagine there was a single person still sitting in their seat after the first song.\n\nBest moment: I was at a concert of Kasabian, in the standing area, and after their first song, the singer shouted at the people in the seats \"hey you over there, c'mon, stand up ! This is no f\\*cking Coldplay concert !\". And everyone joyfully complied.", "did you realize the whole point of this place is to call other people assholes based on your opinion?", "concerts that don't exist", "I don't find it to be performative, it's just kind of instinct to get up and dance when you're vibing with the show. Similar to jamming out in your car. Nobody looks at people sitting and goes \"STAND UP ARENT YOU HAVING ANY FUN??\" I fully expect to be tired and sore the day after a concert from dancing and rumbling around so much, it's like a reminder that I was having a great time the night before.", "Why? The op said that most people were standing, does that made everyone excluding the man who sat an ah? Why is it a dick move to stand at a rock concert? (Regardless of where the seats are) \n\n Yes I get that some people get seats because of physical limitations or disabilities, but usually people get seats because thats the option that is available to them. Yes it sucks that the dude couldn\u2019t see, but at concerts people usually like to rock out and enjoy the music, not sit quietly and and just stare, its not a movie", "Lmao ok", "I have. And I always buy tickets in the seated section, why? Because I have a bad back and can't stand for long periods of time \n\nBut inconsiderate ah's ruin it for everyone", "That seats = sitting?", "They aren't baseline correct just because they're seats. The seats are there because it's an event space that would be used for many different fucking events some where standing is the norm and some where sitting is the norm. They aren't gonna fucking remove all of the seats for an event more people would prefer to stand at because that's vastly to much fucking work for a single event. That doesn't mean the seats _HAVE_ to be sat in. If that were the case people would've been told by security to sit. They fucking weren't so its completely welcomed and reasonable for people to stand at a concert. The guy could've done plenty of things to ensure others wouldn't hurt his enjoyment without having to worry about policing what others do.  It's normal in ops area to do this. That is the cultural norm so doing it doesn't make you an asshole just because \"there are standing sections and seating sections\". In places where standing is the norm the seated sections are for the _option_ of sitting. When it's an event that requires sitting (say a comedy show or play) there will be signs posted asking people not to stand and likely ushers or security that would ask people to sit. There wasn't any of that _so the CHOICE to sit or stand is equally okay for each person._ You don't get to police how other people enjoy their experience when they literally are not breaking any fucking rules. Especially when you had the option of buying seats either in an accessible area where there _is_ a rule against standing and is there for shit like this or get a front row seat in any one the the dozen or more sections so that you don't have to worry about what other people are doing and they don't have to worry about you. People don't get to go to events and make up rules that others have to follow just because they don't like the way all the other people around them are acting, if it were an actual problem the event themselves would've had people deal with it.", "Is it now a social requirement for the section with seats\n\nWhich is generally a majority of the arena\n\nTo sit the entire time\n\nGo outside", "I could sit and silently appreciate an orchestra, but anything rock, pop, country, rap, hip hop, or electronic would seemingly invite some sort of participation. If the music itself is meant to just be about the beauty of music, silent appreciation makes sense to me. Many other genres involve some level of engagement.", "Right the key word there is 'other' That's not how it works for rock music, or country music, or most music that isn't classical.", "Think for yourself doesn't mean always go against the grain no matter the context", "Well next time you\u2019re on the floor look behind you.  Everyone else is standing too.", "Lol the downvotes suck but I feel ya, I copped a lot of hate (to the point of people commenting on my selfies from 2015) for making a similar comment on instagram once. \n\nIf it were 40 years ago and handheld camcorders were super unaffordable and rare, I bet you the same people shitting on people using phones today would be jealous and snarky towards those with the ability to film back then. Everyone's gotta have a problem!", "Lol! Older millennial here and it\u2019s the primary source of conversation as we make eye contact at metal shows while trying to find somewhere to rest our achy weary bones.", "Any concert I've been to ever, has a mixture people standing and sitting in the seated areas. Any concert that I've gone to, people understand the risk of if you choose a seating ticket instead of a standing area ticket, you run the risk of the people in front of you standing up.\nThat's part of the risk of going to concerts altogether, is that you're not going to be able to clearly see the stage. Because other people are attending and enjoying the concert too.", "Not in ampetheatet settings. There is usaually a \u201clawn area\u201d that is general admission where the pits are BEHIND the seating section. Meaning you either get pit or you get close to the stage", "I went to tso and everyone stood . I asked if I 5'4\" could switch my third seat from aisle with a guy over 6ft tall on aisle and he said no. I only saw flames and felt them until they did the moving up high with a crane part.", "No they exist. It\u2019s dependent on the type of musician and audience. For example, my last concert was Bob Dylan. A mostly older crowd who sat through the set.", "if people \"ruin\" every show for you by standing, buy tickets at the front of a section where nobody is seated directly in front of you. voila.", "It\u2019s inconsiderate to expect everyone around you to accomodate your needs. I enjoy standing and singing and dancing at shows with my wife. We\u2019re surrounded by people that do the same. I\u2019m sorry you have a bad back, but the onus is on you to accomodate that to maximize your own enjoyment, not minimize mine for your benefit.", "I've seen \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, They Might Be Giants, Moxy Fruvous, and numerous jazz acts and people generally were only standing if there were no seats.", "And that\u2019s absolutely fine but if someone asked you to sit down in seating you should. You basically say f everyone that can\u2019t stand for the concert, that\u2019s very self-centred. Just buy standing tickets and when your legs get tired/hurt go sit down in the back?", "and op is talking about muse and the norm is standing", "But this wasn\u2019t Dylan. This was MUSE\n\nThat\u2019s like comparing shania Twain and slayer", "People stand in the aisles. Now what?", ">the onus is on you to accomodate that\n\nThat's why I buy a seat \ud83e\udd2f", "well yes there is because lots of places only allow people with walking aids to access those areas. what about if someone has arthritis making it difficult to stand, or autism for sensory overload?", "That's sad.", "Nono!\n\nConcert etiquette is for moshpits only! In the middle you help each other up. When someone wants out, you help them. When a creep starts inappropriately touching a woman you defend her (and that is greatly appreciated, moshpits are about the most safe place a woman can be during a concert in my experience).\n\nOutside of the moshpit it's like being in the wild west and you've got to fend for yourself.", "Sure. That wasn\u2019t what I was talking about, I was responding to your false claim that seated concerts don\u2019t exist.", "thats not allowed at any venue i've ever been to lol not sure where you are but where i am, security shoos people away real quick if they try to stop and claim a spot on a walkway. never been anywhere that just let people block throughways, massive safety hazard.", "Is anyone taking your seat dude? Is anyone telling you you can't sit in it? Nope. Sit down and listen to the music if you can't stand. Enough of this bullshit. Let me tell you what's happening on stage. 3 or 4 dots are moving around and lights are flashing.\n\nDon't make everyone around you as miserable as you are.", "Again, a seat doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re required to sit for the show. I\u2019ve been to 100\u2019s of shows with seats and the norm is to stand. Even if there is a GA area for that concert, people stand.", "Arthritis gets a pass.\n\nThere's no real advantage for an autistic person to be there so probably not unless they're with someone who requires it.\n\nAre people making you prove your disabilities before selling you tickets or something?", "maybe you could try comprehending how a convo works? i said no concerts have people seated in their seats. because that's the kind of concert op was at. being pedantic gets you nowhere. and the person i replied to already stated the exception??", "not every place gives a pass for stuff. i know many people who have been denied a pass for various disabilities", ">There's no real advantage for an autistic person to be there \n\nSo they don't get to experience things because why?"]}
