My husband grew up Orthodox Jewish. His brother has left the religion all together. My husband and I aren't religious anymore but still celebrate holidays culturally. I'm very interested and well read in biblical criticism. I also have respect for my Orthodox family members. I do not intentionally try to offend them.\n\nFor the first Seder we went to FIL's house. BIL and SIL would not stop scoffing and throwing around \"fun facts\" that are simply not true, according to academics who spend decades studying the subject. Then making fun of things that my FIL does. I snapped back that they should consider how accepting FIL is of all of us and the paths we've chosen, instead of trying to change our minds.\n\nThey then said something about Judaism being based off Norse Paganism which is just totally baloney. I said so, but that I will not get into it more out of respect for my FIL. For some reason this pissed SIL off and she kept saying if I wouldn't explain myself then I was just \"covering up lies\". She started going after my parents, asking how \"supposedly intelligent\" people could be \"so gullible\" and insinuated that my parents weren't \"good enough\" Jewish people anyway. I apologized to my FIL and left early. \n\nTomorrow night my husband and I are hosting some of his siblings for dinner. I was shocked when SIL texted me about it. I told her they were no longer invited. She responded back calling me a holier-then-thou know it all, and that I don't get to dictate what she's allowed to say. So I responded back that she sounds like a 15 year old who scanned a Wikipedia page and thinks they know everything.\n\nMy BIL called my husband, who asked me if I would reconsider if they promised not to bring that stuff up. I said their beliefs weren't the issue, it was the insulting my parents, and they could come if SIL apologized. He communicated this to BIL who said this was \"unreasonable\" and that I should be the one apologizing because my last text made SIL cry. \n\nMy husband says he understands how I feel and will support me either way, but could I consider just dropping it. I don't want to drop it but I don't know if that's just me being stubborn. I don't like causing drama, but I also really don't feel like being around them.

Pesach is a time for family, reflection, and respect, not for insulting parents and stirring up drama. She insulted your parents, refused to apologize, and they make it sounds like it's your fault.\n\nPersonally, if I unintentionally insult someone, I don't make a big deal about apologizing. It's not unreasonable.

You don't get to try to force *your* values and beliefs onto the people who taught you *theirs*. How they treat their own father is reprehensible. He and his wife thiught their beliefs and values were important enough that they took the time to instruct their children and raise them with those values and beliefs.\n\nWe want our children to be like us, only better.

I would worry that that level of stupid would leak out and get all over the furniture.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Honestly, it sounds to me like SIL has dipped so far into paganism/the occult that she's wound up going down the rabbit hole of the \"Aryan\" neomythology created in the 1880s by people like Karl Penka and Helena Blavatsky which eventually led to the Nazis' obsession with combining history/archeology and the occult to justify their racism. And that should be deeply concerning for a Jewish family.\n\nThe Norse didn't keep a lot of written history for a long while and their mythology doesn't have all that great historical attestation - seriously, the earliest record we have of Odin comes from [the 5th century CE](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna73939). There is no good reason why she should think that Judaism, with a traceable history of over 3000 years could possibly be a knock-off of a religion half its age. \n\nIt's conspiracy theory bullshit. And antisemitic conspiracy theories, to boot.", ">I don't like causing drama\n\nCould've fooled me. \n\nSounds like you caused a lot of drama by butting into a conversation between your in-laws, baiting them, and then rescinding their invitation to dinner. Everyone here sounds insufferable. ESH", "Probably a hot take, but ESH.\n\nYou're 100% right to be pissed off at the way SIL acted, she's a jackass.  Good on you for telling her she blows and that she needs to apologize.  She sucks a whoooooole lot for saying that and then getting all pissy when you called her on her bullshit.\n\nHowever, coming from someone who also culturally celebrates Passover with some (at times, in the past) obnoxious family members, I feel like it's not worth it to dig your heels in here.  It's nice your husband is supporting you either way, and I'm sure he probably thinks SIL is shitty too, but it's a family holiday and SIL is part of his family. \n\nSo, SIL is the AH to, like, the 10th degree. You're NTA for telling her she sucks and that she needs to apologize, but YTA in a small way for barring her from Passover.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
