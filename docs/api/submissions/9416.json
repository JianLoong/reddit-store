You let her move in with her kids. You can still live separate lives and you deserve time with your kids alone. Not to mention, you\u2019ve been doing this since before she started staying with you. Her situation sucks but you shouldn\u2019t have to change something that you\u2019ve been doing with your family IMO. The pizza is a good idea though!", "NAH. \n\nI say that rather than N-T-A because I\u2019m giving your sister the grace that this is a hard situation for her to navigate and explaining the breakdown of a family to young kids is hard enough without having to also explain why they can\u2019t have all the things they used to have but have to watch their cousins get those things. I feel for her and assuming your relationship is good otherwise, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s TA. More like a stressed parent trying to do the best she can. \n\nThat being said, keep to your traditions. Have a conversation with her at a time where this isn\u2019t an imminent issue. Maybe she can take her kids to do something cheap/free while you\u2019re out with yours so it feels less like it\u2019s being rubbed in their face to them.", "NTA. You are offering help and a place to stay, not a lifestyle change on your end. I feel awful for you sister and nieces, but their mom needs to step up and fix the issue by offering to find the money to cover a meal if she wants her kids to have that. \n\nIf not, she can leave.", "NTA. I agree with you completely.", "NTA\n\nIt's your kids, your money, and they should respect that", "Nta it\u2019s good for your relationship with your children to also have some alone time", "NTA.\n\nYour budget and your family traditions both include you and the kids enjoying eating out together once a week.\n\nYour sister needs to be grateful for all that you're able to do for her and realize that asking you to suspend your weekly tradition will wear out her welcome faster. If she's committed to moving out within the next few weeks, it might be a reasonable request. If there is no end in sight for her and her kids staying with you, she simply needs to come to grips with the fact that you can't afford to raise her standard of living to match yours \\*and\\* it's unreasonable to ask you to lower your standard of living to what she can afford. She's already quite fortunate that you're willing to let her stay with you.", "NTA. It's hard on your nieces, of course. They have lost so much already. But, you need to take care of your kids. And a little family time away from longterm house guests is probably very needed. (Info. Does your sister work? Pay rent? Why does she not have money to buy dinner ?)", "NTA\n\nYou have given her and her children a place to live. You didnt agree to be married to her. It sounds like you do 'family style' most of the time but this is a tradition that you and your kids have done for a long time.\n\nIts sad that she doesnt have the money to take her kids out like that, but its also not your fault nor should your kids be punished for her unfortunate circumstances. As it is, they have to share their house and you and probably alot of their things with their cousins now, so taking something away wouldnt be fair.\n\nMaybe she and her kids could participate once or twice a month where you pool your money and bring take out food home for everyone to share and the other times you can take your kids out with you and she can maybe make something special at home for her kids.\n\nThere are alot of ways to do 'special meals' without spending alot of money, at home. She and her kids could make home made pizza's or something, on those nights you take your kids out.\n\nOn her part, she could be focusing on building those traditions that she can afford, with her kids, now that she is single -- and would be a good thing.\n\nWhen I was first single with my kids, we got stuff from the Dollar Tree (craft things) and once a week we painted or glued or did something crafty. And these were the things they gave to their Grandparents for Christmas.  It cost very little but was a tradition that we started and it continued until my kids were out of high school!", "NAH\n\nI understand your sister asking about it. But I don\u2019t think you need to change it.\n\nIf you can do pizza once a month with her and the kids and then continue with your kids the other weeks, hopefully they understand in time.\n\nMaybe letting them know, you are so happy that they are with you and you know they\u2019ve had some changes. Mention the monthly pizza. I\u2019d also mention that it\u2019s important for you and your kids to have/maintain some traditions of your own.\n\nMaybe your sister could set up an ice bar or s\u2019mores making or something fun for the nights you\u2019re out or an indoor picnic and movie or maybe you all do it together another night.\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard having extra people in the house and it\u2019s important for you and your kids to be able to get some time alone and do some check ins. \n\nYour sister probably just wants to fix it the easiest way for her and the kids and she should explain that she understands it can be hard seeing you guys go out, but that it\u2019s important for you as a family to have this time together. It doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t love them. It\u2019s ok for them to be sad/frustrated, but you should have some things as a family.", "NAH I do think having more of a roommate like dinner approach would have made it less obvious when you guys do other things, but failing that, framing it in the first instance as each family getting alone time such that it still felt special to them at home would have been better than you guys just heading out once a week while her kids piece together that it\u2019s for a special outing that they can\u2019t have. For now, Your sister should find non-food things or cheap food things that make that night fun. Maybe that\u2019s their movie night, or build a blanket fort night or pancakes for dinner night. Maybe every once in a while you make it something other than dinner so your outing isn\u2019t centered around food - eat at home and then take just your kids to the park or for a drive or something your sister theoretically could afford, so that is about family time, not their lack of money.", "NTA.  Eat out whenever you want. She has literally no say in it.", "Nta you deserve you time.with your kids you've already helped your sister  out loads  you have to put your kids first", "NTA.  You three need alone time as a family since your house is now very full.  You can still have once a month pizza night with everyone.  Your sister can also find free things to do with her kids so you both have free time from each other.\n\nHave a serious discussion with your sister.  Your life shouldn't have to change because she's there.  Tell her that basically you are roommates until she leaves.", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed to have special moments with just your kids. \n\nThe fact that your sister lives with you does not mean that you have to include everyone in everything all the time. \n\nYou may want to encourage your sister to make those nights special with her kids too. They can have movie nights or \"camp\" in the living room or something else different and fun that doesn't require a lot of money.", "NTA. You and your kids shouldn\u2019t be punished because she can\u2019t afford to do the same. She should be grateful for the help they\u2019re getting and keep it pushing.", "NTA. It is very considerate not to bring food home your sister can't afford for her family. And wanting time every now and then with just you kids makes sense. Just be sure your kids aren't talking about it in front of the others.", "NAH. You are doing them a favor and it is on your sister to teach her kids that not everything is fair in life. You could cut it down to once every other week while sister is there though. Pizza night also sounds like a lovely idea. \n\nThey lost their dad, their home, and they are now seeing how lucky their cousins have it. But it isn't on you to cater to them when you are already being nice enough as a single mom to let them stay with you. I can see where it might hurt their feelings though, as kids don't understand these things. That's why I say maybe just cut it to every other week instead for now?\n\n Or! You could go eat before grocery shopping and just don't tell them you ate out while you were shopping at the grocery store with your kids.", "NTA. But, maybe when you take your kids out, you can get ice cream for ALL the kids. Or a candy bar. Something that the kids that stayed home can look forward to, as well as your own kids. Bring it home and they can all have a treat together.", "NAH \u2026 but, consider the lesson you\u2019re teaching your own kids and how your nieces and nephews may feel .. and your sister.", "NTA. It's important to preserve some family unit time with you and your two kids. Just because you all live together now doesn't mean you all have to do everything together every single day. Preserving that tradition is great. \n\nJust because you keep doing this one tradition with your kids doesn't mean you can't also start a new one with your sister and her kids, though. There's no reason you can't *also* do a monthly pizza night or Ice Cream Sundays or taco Tuesdays or any other new special thing for your now blended family. If money's the problem you can make pizza, buy bulk ice cream, etc. Feel free to keep your weekly dinner but just add on another thing too for the nieces.", "Having grown up quite poor and then poorer when my mom felt we had \u201cjust enough\u201d to help other people at the expense of all \u201ctreats\u201d or private time together and occasionally necessities\u2026 I have to go with NTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like the living situation will change soon. \n\nIf you really can\u2019t afford to take everyone and she really can\u2019t afford to join, it would be gracious to maybe skip a week and do pizza once a month- but those \u201conly us\u201d times with your kids are probably sacred to them and they don\u2019t even realize it. I understand your sister asking, but it\u2019s okay to take time for just your kiddos. Doubly so if you\u2019re able to bring home ice cream or do something \u201cspecial\u201d occasionally with her family. \n\nIt\u2019s a tough spot to be in.

Great role model for these kids, by the way.", "ESH\n\nYou admit that you saw this as a win win with childcare trade offs to have her move in. \n\nSome kindness would go a long way here. Your sister and those kids have their entire lives changed without their input. The stress she must be under trying to figure out what she is going to do long term is much more than your stress of these extra people you chose to invite into your home is causing you. \n\nTalk to your sister so that everyone can get some family unit alone time which will ease tensions.

Your kids count, too. NTA.", "That's a tough one because this is a crappy situation for everyone.

NAH, and I hope you can figure out a compromise.", "I agree NTA and that OP shouldn't have to change habits. \n\nBut, man, it's got to be really frustrating for the sister's kids to be left out, without having any knowledge of finances, budgeting, or adult rationalization. They don't know what they've done wrong, but now they see themselves being treated like second class citizens.", "Great perspective", "Or could the special meal be something they could all do together once a month?

She already said it's not in her budget.", "So I think NTA, but if you're looking for a middle ground maybe once every few weeks you guys could get a tub of ice cream and have an ice cream party with all the kids..?", "Well, just say what my parents always did when they tried to get away from us\n\n\\*Us kids to parents\\* \"Where you going?\" \\*parents\\* \"Crazy!\" \\*Us\\* \"oh....\n\nYou don't have to blatantly say where you are going (though too late they probably know by now). Your sister could be taking her kids to the park for a picnic or something to distract them too when you go for your dinner.\n\nThis isn't a you problem, it is a your sister problem. She needs to take care of it, but I do see where she might feel guilty towards her kids and thus feel bad when they see you eating out every week. I get why she may ask you to cut it down. But, I would say you don't have to agree to do so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: That's why I say NAH btw, instead of N.T.A. I don't see where it was wrong for her to have asked.

If you stay at home and eat as a family and don\u2019t leave out the others, you\u2019re teaching empathy, understanding, doing something for others. Simply having a conversation like, \u201clisten, I know we like eating out, but our family is here and I feel badly leaving them out. I think it would be nice to have a special dinner altogether at home to make them feel included.
