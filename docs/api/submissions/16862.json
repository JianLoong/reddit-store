It's important for her to understand that not everyone has the same financial situation and ability to travel, and it's not fair to expect people to go above and beyond what they can reasonably afford. It's great that you're trying to talk to her about it, but it's ultimately her decision on how she wants to plan her wedding. Hopefully, she'll take your concerns into consideration and make adjustments that are more feasible for everyone involved.", "NTA \n\nYou agreed to be a part of the wedding party not knowing of the expenses and being part of the wedding party/ as family, it is ok to voice ur opinion that it is too expensive for you and possibly the other guests.

You wish you could, but that it's too expensive. Then tell her that a lot of the members of the wedding party are planning to drop out too for the same reason.

Maybe a group of you could have a sort of intervention. I guess you could always tell her what you are able to afford and tell her you can't be involved in everything that she's planning.\n\nThe gifts thing - don't feel like you need to give her a gift for every damn party she has.

People aren\u2019t going to prioritise their money on gifts/travel/hotels/etc for her wedding. \n\nMy niece wanted a destination wedding and was looking at Europe. She and her mother were very excited and stated that she could get so much more for their wedding budget than in our home country. Her mother is an elitist who lives off her rich husband\u2019s money, and doesn\u2019t live in the real world. Low income households are struggling to eat because of rise of living costs but she can\u2019t understand why people are moaning, \u2018surely they should just work more hours\u2019. \n\nAt a family dinner, the bride bought up the question \u201cif I marry abroad, will your family go?\u201d\n\nI said that I\u2019d have to look at our budget but if a three day destination wedding is more than our family holiday, then no. Her mother then piped up, \u201cwell you could always get a loan\u201d.

She's a bridesmaid in this one too and talks about all the differences.", "NTA\n\nmaybe start a group with the other bridesmaids and ask for their opinions, especially about how they\u2018re gonna afford something like that. \n\nWhen there are enough people with the same opinions you should sit her down together and tell her that it\u2018s impossible to spend all your personal money on one person\u2018s dream and throw yourselves and your own dreams/plans that you\u2018re saving up for back for years.", "NTA.\n\n\n\nYour sister may be entitled to her dream wedding etc., BUT she needs to realise that she's NOT entitled to demand others to afford/spend possibly a fortune on it.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019ve told friends and family if their wedding is a destination wedding (eg to the Caribbean, not me having to fly to their home city) or destination bachelor party or their wedding is child free, then I won\u2019t be coming.
