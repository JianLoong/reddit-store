There is very little else you can do other than refuse to attend all the additional events and concentrate on the actual wedding day only.

It's bad enough that weddings nowadays seem to bankrupt the parents/bride & groom the way the costs have spiralled out of control, but where does it say that all the guests have to bankrupt themselves as well?  If everyone saved the costs of outfitting ever-larger bridal parties, ridiculously expensive wedding dresses, venues and feeding 100-200 people, most of whom either the bride or the groom don't know, and/or don't like, there would be enough money for a party with actual friends and family, a fabulous honeymoon and in some cases even a deposit on a first home.  The wedding industry and (mostly) bride's expectations have spun out of control, I do not understand what feeds this obsession with colour-coordinated dresses, venue colour schemes, food, out-of-this-world venues, and inviting the world and their wife to a wedding?  Most brides and grooms end up not enjoying these monstrous productions, and probably don't remember very much about the actual day afterwards.

Flying hither and yon is expensive and your sister should realize that she's not the damn Kardashians. I'm so sick of hearing of demands like this. People can't afford this crap! Even when they make six figures they can't afford this crap! It's ridiculous IMO. Someone getting married is not the most important thing in the world except to the two getting married. They need to start realizing that and manage expectations accordingly.", "NTA, but good lord. \n\nYeah, your sister is being a little insane, and I\u2019m being generous here. An expensive wedding is all well and good, provided that the wedding party and attendees are made aware of the costs *before* they agree to take part. Clearly, that\u2019s not the case here. \n\nFrankly, this seems like a shakedown. Your sister is asking her bridal party to take their hard earned money and PTO, so she can have two very expensive holidays that exclusively celebrate her.

Tell her that you cannot afford it, you have to budget what you can do, and from what you're hearing from everyone else, she is distressing everyone with her expectations.\n\nShe needs to know it's not just you, and hearing it from her own family would be best. What a selfish bride - the wedding is supposed to be about love, and she is using her love for her husband as an excuse to use others.", "Yup. NTA but it was probably a tactical error to talk to your sister in a general way about how this is out of hand. Attend the parts you can, decline the parts you can't (feeling free to tell her exactly why, i.e., \"I'm sorry to miss your bachelorette trip, but it's not in my budget! Looking forward to the wedding though!\"). There is no room for argument there - she can offer to pay your way, but she can't force you to attend when you can't afford it. She might still be mad, but it will be easier to manage if you are not judging HER plans, just letting her know what is possible for YOU. Leave all other bridal party members and guests to set their own boundaries.", "Beyond absurd as OP mentioned this is a second marriage and that she was much more reasonable for her first. I wonder if she feels like she didn't get the wedding of her dreams + the 1st marriage ending has made her go overboard and veer into bridezilla. OP should sit her down again and find out why she is having such an exorbitant second wedding and to remind her that people's funds are not unlimited and if she wants people to be at this wedding she has to make it so people can afford to go.

Once we passed 25, my friends all 1) knew what they liked and bought it themselves and more importantly 2) could afford better (and appreciate better) than Vicky's Secret.", "It's tacky and low-class to stick your attendants with big bills.

Why this is indeed out of control:\n\n>The bridesmaid dress and the shoes will cost over me $500.\n\nThat's ridiculous.  Example: my wife told her bridesmaids to go find something silver or grey and she'd give them each \u00a3100.  As for shoes, they could wear existing ones or get their own new ones. \n\n>She is planning an international trip (Las Vegas) for her bachelorette party\n\nThat alone sounds expensive.  My wife's bachelorette party was a quiet rural affair two hours drive away.  I get some people like a big city do - indeed my mate tried to get us to do his in Dubai which is a 7 hour flight away - but not everyone has that kind of cash.  In the case of Dubai boy, his stag do was in London which is the nearest city to where he lives. \n\n>They already had an engagement party, my sister is throwing a bridal shower on top of it.\n\nGod.  People are gonna be sick of project TFW at this rate (That Fucking Wedding).  What is the difference between a bachelorette party and a bridal shower anyway?\n\n>Plus the cheapest option on their registry is $165.\n\nIf registry is N American for gift list, that's off the scale rude whether it's USD or CAD.  Our cheapest item was aimed at some relatives who were poor students - a laundry basket for \u00a36.50 and we made damn sure to have lots under \u00a325.\n\n>Now they decided they want to have a resort wedding in the Caribbean instead of getting married here, so that's another trip/flight/hotel. \n\nProbably because if they get something like 20 guests to come and stay for a week then their whole trip, stay and wedding is free.  Not had that happen to me, but I have friends who have experienced that one.\n\n>I'm hearing similar complaints from her fianc\u00e9's wedding party members especially because it's his second wedding too. Lots of the families and friends are feeling put out about being asked to give 3 different gifts and now having the wedding moved to another country.\n\nI'm not surprised!  Watch them all drop like flies as the date approaches as they duck out for various reasons (hopefully most will be honest that they can't get close to affording this nonsense).\n\n>I tried to tell my sister this is getting to be too much for the bridesmaids and groomsmen not to mention the guests even\n\nGood for you!\n\n>She didn't take it well and we've had a couple of big arguments.\n\nBridezilla alert.\n\n>I want to stand with her at her wedding but it's getting out of control.\n\nI applaud you.\n\n>She's normally not like this but I feel like I'm talking to a wall with her. I'm not even the only one to bring this up either. She doesn't listen or doesn't care and it's causing arguments.\n\nIt's time to draft a joint statement and set up a group call with them olus the maid of honour, bridesmaids, groomsmen, siblings and both sets of parents to identify how much this is gonna cost for the attendees nd how much most people have to budget on this.  There will be a gap and it's up to the couple to either accept absences at some/all of it due to insufficient funds or if people's presence matter more than far flung destinations then they should scale back the pre parties and the big day itself and they can burn the money on a new house, car or mega honeymoon.", "NTA that\u2019s too much!

I ended up telling the bride that I could either do the wedding or the bridal shower . That the cost was prohibitive and unreasonable to ask, that there was no way I could justify spending more money in the role as Bridesmaid, than I did on my entire own wedding.. \n\nI was \"uninvited\" from the wedding*(shocker)* \n\nIn  the end she lost half the bridal party and other than  parents and sibs, most of the family on both sides didn't attend.", "NTA just tell her you are out and your problem is solved.

Not everyone can afford destination weddings and parties.", "If someone wants to waste a ridiculous amount of money on a party, that's they're business. If they want to waste everyone else's, they're an AH. Also, it's gauche to make this kind of a fuss on a second wedding.

And yes, it's going off the rails. \n\nMaybe have at least some of the others join you in a sit down and tell your sister either she can pay for it herself or she scale things back to something everyone can easily afford.
