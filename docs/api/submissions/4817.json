Two nights before the wedding, my wife\u2019s immediate family divided off for the evening, with the males and females doing separate activities. My future father-in-law, and 2 future brothers-in-law (33 and 40) decided to spent the night in my father-in-law\u2019s hotel room, for a quiet night in, watching sport on tv, over beers and pizza. \n\nI rang the pizza shop (a well-known national franchise) and was starting to place orders for some pizzas. As I was ordering, the youngest brother-in-law asked me what was the price of the pizzas that were being ordered. I told him the prices. He immediately started yelling: \u201ccancel the order. It\u2019s too much. The same pizzas in [his home town] from the same store cost $5 less\u201d. \n\nFor context, I have a well paying job so the price of the pizzas wasn\u2019t something that affected my decision about whether to order. It\u2019s a holiday town and so there was going to be a premium for what was already fairly cheap pizza from a no-frills cheap-and-cheerful franchise. My BIL lives in a regional town, earns reasonable coin for the area, but has a well-honed appreciation for the value of money shall we say. \n\nI dismissed the BIL\u2019s objection with a wave of my hand and said: \u201cdon\u2019t worry, I got this, my shout\u201d. \n\nThe BIL kept protesting but when I hung up the phone, he got up, said I\u2019m not eating that pizza and made himself a toasted sandwich, which he proceeded to eat, and gave the rest of us the silent treatment for the rest of the night. \n\nThe pizzas arrived and the rest of us ate it in largely awkward silence. \n\nSo, readers, AITA?", "created_utc": 1671137370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmvogp/aita_for_ordering_overpriced_pizza_over_my/", "score": 703, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
