{"id": 4817, "submission_id": "zmvogp", "title": "AITA for ordering overpriced pizza over my brother-in-law\u2019s objection?", "selftext": "I (M33) recently got married, in a holiday town about an hour away from my wife\u2019s home town in Australia. Two nights before the wedding, my wife\u2019s immediate family divided off for the evening, with the males and females doing separate activities. My future father-in-law, and 2 future brothers-in-law (33 and 40) decided to spent the night in my father-in-law\u2019s hotel room, for a quiet night in, watching sport on tv, over beers and pizza. \n\nI rang the pizza shop (a well-known national franchise) and was starting to place orders for some pizzas. As I was ordering, the youngest brother-in-law asked me what was the price of the pizzas that were being ordered. I told him the prices. He immediately started yelling: \u201ccancel the order. It\u2019s too much. The same pizzas in [his home town] from the same store cost $5 less\u201d. \n\nFor context, I have a well paying job so the price of the pizzas wasn\u2019t something that affected my decision about whether to order. It\u2019s a holiday town and so there was going to be a premium for what was already fairly cheap pizza from a no-frills cheap-and-cheerful franchise. My BIL lives in a regional town, earns reasonable coin for the area, but has a well-honed appreciation for the value of money shall we say. \n\nI dismissed the BIL\u2019s objection with a wave of my hand and said: \u201cdon\u2019t worry, I got this, my shout\u201d. \n\nThe BIL kept protesting but when I hung up the phone, he got up, said I\u2019m not eating that pizza and made himself a toasted sandwich, which he proceeded to eat, and gave the rest of us the silent treatment for the rest of the night. \n\nThe pizzas arrived and the rest of us ate it in largely awkward silence. \n\nSo, readers, AITA?", "created_utc": 1671137370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmvogp/aita_for_ordering_overpriced_pizza_over_my/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

From the way you're telling the story, I don't even see the BIL's point. Cancel the pizza and then stop eating until you're in a cheaper town ? If you're not in the town that sells cheap pizza, order the pizza you have access to. Way to ruin the night for the groom for no logical reason.", "NTA: he\u2019s being the asshole. Not only does it not matter about the price when it\u2019s your treat and you\u2019re paying for it but for him to throw his toys out the pram afterwards and refuse to eat it is a complete and utter overreaction and childlike behaviour. I\u2019d keep an eye on him after your marriage as that behaviour could be a nightmare", "NTA. I mean, did he think it would've been cheaper to have the pizza delivered from his home town to the hotel you were staying at?", "NTA.\n\nYou paid for it and he\u2018s throwing a fit over nothing. He doesn\u2019t have to eat the pizza, but he can\u2018t forbid you to buy something with your own money just because he \"disapproves\".", "NTA\n\nIt takes a real AH to turn down pizza dinner and camaraderie, especially if other's offered to cover the difference.", "NTA \nBIL acting like a child \nJust to confirm were you spitting the cost of the pizza or just covering it for your family- if that\u2019s the case he is a Giant A", "NTA, primarily because you picked up the tab. If you had asked him to split, it would have been different.", "What on earth. NTA. And I\u2019m here trying to figure out if it was Crust you ordered from \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. You're paying, he was grandstanding. He's mad because a) you didn't listen, b) no one else followed his lead, and c) he had to eat a sandwich while smelling and watching everyone else eat hot, delicious pizza.", "Obviously NTA\n\nBIL is TA, his reaction was extreme to begin with, then he pouted like a child.", "NTA. What your BIL did was extremely rude.", "You paid for it, so I'm not understanding why he's upset. His behavior is childish, and it's his loss. NTA.", "Does he have an interest or share in that other pizza shop? I understand wanting to order local, but sometimes convenient pizza supersedes that. \n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole - your the awesome who paid for the pizza. He\u2019s a strange bird. This was the hill he decided to die on?", "NTA. It wasn't his money being spent.", "INFO: on what planet would anyone other than your BIL be an asshole? You ordered pizza and paid for it yourself and your BIL made his own sandwich and then pouted like a child for the rest of the night because he thought pizza he was never expected to pay for was too expensive. \n\nSeriously, how is it possible you need to ask this question?", ">he got up, said I\u2019m not eating that pizza and made himself a toasted sandwich, (...) and gave the rest of us the silent treatment\n\n\n\nThis is a capricious tantrum a child would pull. I can't believe this man is 33 years old\n\nNTA", "NTA his way overreacted\u2026 about pizza\u2026 that he wast even paying for\u2026", "NTA, you paid for it so who cares?  Seems like the behavior of a 5yo, not an adult.", "NTA he has issues that have nothing to do with you, or anyone else.", "You paid for it, whats his problem? \n\nNtA", "NTA it was nice of you to treat them to pizza.  Also what kind of person doesn't like free food?!", "NTA. BIL was acting childishly. Why try to punish you for eating pizza that cost more than he believed it should when he wasn't even paying? Was the pizza and money so much more important to him than the company? Sounds like he's overly controlling here.", "NTA.  If he wants to sulk over pizza he\u2019s not paying for whether he eats it or not, that\u2019s his problem.", "NTA glad everyone else enjoyed the pizza!", "NTA. What the heck? It was your money to spend, not his.", "NTA.   Seriously, a 33 year old man behaved like this?  WTF.", "NTA. You bought someone pizza and an expensive area and they complained that it was pricier than the pizza they got at home? You are not the asshole, your brother-in-law is just weird.", "NTA\n\nit your money why is he get  mad about a  free pizza osome people just make no sense", "Oh no, 5$ more! \n\nSeriously I don't get it? I mean I'm not a huge fan of domino's pizza, but I love their hot wings \n\nThings in tourist towns are more expensive what was he expecting? \n\nSource - grew up in a very high tourist location.", "I mean, I see it was Dominos, which I think *checks notes* yes. Has been made a rule that it's an automatic Y T A, regardless of scenario.\n\nBut no, let your BIL cut off his nose with his dry arse toastie to spite his pizza-less face. It costs less somewhere else? Alert the damn media.\n\nMore pizza for everyone else. The only concern is why this wasn't an occasion for joy, rather than awkward silence - is his life so small that this was the major event of 2022?

What a weird hill to die on, he was getting free to him pizza.\n\nWhat some people don't realize is that tourist (holiday) cities cost more, it's the nature of the beast.", "NTA. If you expected him to share in the cost I would say otherwise. He sounds like he just doesn't like to be out of a position of control. Tough. Congrats on the wedding.", "NTA\u2026 your BIL is a brat and a half\u2026 and at 33? Dang\u2026 I can\u2019t.", "NTA. As a Pizza connoisseur, good pizza is never cheap and I understand about ordering cheaper pizza for a large group but it was just you guys, small group. Your BIL is a big baby. You said you would cover it but he got upset and acted like a child. You offered to pay so ultimately it's up to you. Enjoy another slice for me", "Wow, you are NTA, but BIL sure is!! This was your bachelor party, right? And he\u2019s throwing a fit over $5 difference? Even in the same city, different McDonald\u2019s will have different prices on their McCaf\u00e9 depending on which store. Like the one near campus is the most. I just can\u2019t get over what an AH BIL was. And you even said you were paying for the food for your own event?", "NTA.  Sounds like your BIL was already angry and just looking for an excuse to be a grump.  Is he always this difficult?", "NTA...and what is your BIL's deal? He wasn't even paying, I really don't understand it. Good eat your sandwich and STFU I guess?", "It was the principle of it, I think. He told me to cancel and I refused.", "Would have loved to hear that conversation.", "I offered to pay, and then paid, the whole of the cost of the pizzas for everyone.", "It takes a real AH (or anyone really) to turn down free pizza period.", "Worse. Domino\u2019s in Byron Bay. \ud83d\ude48", "I mean, it was Dominos. They were eating hot, edible pizza.", "Because I did defy his request that I cancel the order, he was about to be my BIL, and I knew he has a stubborn streak.", "Besides everyone knows the prices vary from location to location. no matter if it's Pizza,  Walmart or anything else", "I was thinking that too. A tantrum over pizza, not only that, but pizza he wasn't paying for?", "Principles don't feed a wedding party XD", "Ding ding! He is controlling, and that should be a big red flag. He may be anxious about losing \"power\" in his position in the family since you are marrying in and are his same age, he is being insecure. So, when his attempt at forcing his power at you failed, he sulked like a toddler. \n\nAt least, that's my theory from what's presented here. Seems like some weird toxic masculinity alpha-male silliness.", "BIL is a piece of work sorry for the awkwardness he created for no reason", "Hahaha I was debating Domino\u2019s or Crust but figured from the way BIL was freaking out, Crust was a bit more \u201cpremium\u201d. \n\nYou guys better not eat anything else in Byron, he\u2019ll keel over in shock!", "NTA. He\u2019s a tightwad and was afraid of getting the bill. Dominos is horrible, hope no tummy issues!!", "I can pretty much guarantee the smell of melted cheese and pepperoni made him think the pizza everyone else was eating tasted amazing, and he couldn't prove otherwise because he was stubbornly eating his sandwich to make a point.", "> Because I did defy his request that I cancel the order\n\n...and so what if you did? It's not like you were making him pay for it lol", "This is stupid, he was never paying for it. Why on earth would you cancel an order for tasty food on it's way that you paid for because some dude was having a hissy fit?", "I'm struggling to think how someone even has a tantrum over pizza. Like, even if it's not great, it's pizza you didn't pay for bro.", "But then all he needed to do is remember the name on the pizza box - I\u2019d rather have a toasted sandwich than another of their pizza\u2019s (toasted sandwich just one of the things on a very long list\u2026). But that\u2019s no excuse for his behaviour- NTA"]}
