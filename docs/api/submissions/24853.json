You should have walked away.", "Ouch\n\nI get your inappropriate laughter, have trouble with this sometimes too but yeah YTA \ud83d\ude2c but you already know you messed up. It's hard to get a relationship back from that, he feels disrespected and betrayed. Maybe he'll be able to talk to you and work it through after a bit more time has passed.", "ESH. The parents most of all and OP kinda. Laughing however is an involuntary response though. And OP did apologize after.\n\nOn the downside bf was watching his family falling apart at the seams so no wonder he's pissed.", "YTA\n\nI think you already know your reaction hurt your bf. Even if this reaction was involuntary, it\u2019s wrong & unkind.\n\nYou screwed up. Just own it & keep apologizing. Hopefully, you hear back from him.", "If somebody really enjoys the schadenfreude of conservatives being exposed for being hypocrites, it's me. But as much as I really truly understand this was an involuntary reaction that was a mixture of shock and nerves, I'm afraid YTA. Your bf and his family's whole world has come apart, and I'm sure they are all devastated. I hope you can come back from this, but you have a lot of work to do to try and make it up to him. And that should start with not gossiping to your friends about this- like, ever.", "Can you update us on how this resolves?\n\nSmall YTA, but I think a lot of your boyfriends distance comes from everything going on within the rest of the family.\n\nMaybe he feels embarrassed and thinks you\u2019ll judge him and critique him, and use this as something to embarrass him or attack him with in later arguments. For example, I always personally feel attacked when my wife criticizes my mother, even though many times my mothers behavior is wrong and does warrant some criticism, because my mother is still my mother and no one talks shit about my mother except for me. \n\nMaybe his own understanding and belief in relationships, trust, and commitment are shaken by what happened.\n\nBest you can do is give him space, but offer him an unconditional judgement free zone when he\u2019s ready to make up. \n\nYou apologized, not much more you can do.. just keep in mind no matter what he says/vents about his family, he\u2019ll get upset if you talk about them in similar language.", "YTA. Your BF's family is unravelling and you laugh!  As soon as you started feeling amused by the hypocrisy you should have excused yourself and raced away from the house  to laugh where they could not hear you or see your amusement at their pain. \n\nWork on your poker face.", "Of course YTA. You're supposed to at least make enough of an effort to hold it in or leave.", "YTA Your bff's family just got ripped apart. How do you think he feels? It isn't about them, it's about him. He's decreased, and you laughed.", "I\u2019ve never seen blow out spelled that way!", "YTA - Not the right place for laughter.  While it may feel satisfying to see the inside of the hypocrisy-sausage-factory, your obligation in that moment is to not become a part of the volatile moment and to support your partner.  Laughing at his family's dysfunction in that moment is the opposite of that.", "YTA. Your boyfriends parents sound like the worst kind of people, but laughing in your boyfriends face while his family is falling apart makes you the asshole", "It's completely understandable that you laughed, but also it was the wrong reaction. It honestly would be more appropriate to break into laughter at a funeral.\n\nWhether you intended it or not, you almost certainly made your boyfriend feel humiliated, possibly twice over. Once because you heard how his world was falling apart, and you laughed at him. The second time because if any of his family heard you laughing, then he's the one who brought a non family member into a very, very personal family moment AND when the non family member heard the news she LAUGHED AT THEM. YTA.\n\nEven if he is the kind to agree it's funny and not be humiliated, you should reasonably expect that he's going to be very distracted while his family tries to reconcile (or not). If he was offended, then you moved you out of the supportive safe person to relax around while this nightmare plays out kind of relationship, and into another problem to be sorted.\n\nThis family revelation has a solid chance of making your boyfriend question a bunch of stuff about himself, and maybe even his plans for the future. If he does break up with you, understand that it won't *just* be because you laughed. And it won't mean he wasn't happy before this. Big life events can make us decide to change the direction of our lives.\n\nFinally write the shortest possible message containing the next elements:\n\n1. I assume you already apologised. Maybe not well (look up the 4 step apology) but possibly profusely. If so write your 4 step apology on paper and put it in your pocket or something.\n\n2. If you haven't done the below, do it once.\n\nIf he has a favourite cafe/eatery, ask if you could join him for breakfast or lunch or whatever you two would sometimes do on a crazy busy week. Just to see him, and to give him a hug. Emphasise that it can just be 30 minutes if that's all the time he has, that you'd like to see him because you miss him.\n\n3. Tell him you understand there's a lot going on in his life right now, and you don't want to be an unwanted distraction so you're going to leave him be for the next two weeks unless he wants to reconnect sooner. Which you hope he does, especially if you can meet for coffee.\n\n\nThen leave him alone for 2 weeks unless he reaches out.\n\nAn example:\n\nBoyfriend. I know there's a lot of shit going on in your world, and I don't want to make your life any harder. I miss you, and if you're free next Thursday,  I'd love to meet you at Cafe. We can talk about anything you want, including not talking about anything you don't want to. I would love to see you and give you a hug. If you can't stay for long, I understand.\n\nI'm going to stop blowing up your phone, unless you say you want me to continue. If I haven't heard from you in two weeks, I'll reach out again. I hope I do hear from you. If I can help in any other way, please let me know.", "YTA - Whilst I see the humour, laughing out loud in front of the whole family.....bad move on your part!", "YTA. \n\nI do see the irony and I bet it probably felt, in a way, like karma or justice after the way MIL judged and criticized you. However, people's lives were torn apart in the moment, people were hurting, people's heads were swirling from the information....It wasn't JUST the MIL...Everyone, including your bf, was dealing with the news and everything that meant. There are certain times when laughing isn't appropriate and...This is one of those times.", "YTA. I'm also a nervous laugher, and I can definitely see how that could be one of those situations, but you've gotta read the room. If he had been laughing a bit telling you about the situation, it would have been different, but it sounds like he was upset and you laughed in his face.", "You definitely should've apologized asap, but even if you did I doubt his reaction would've changed. Still tho **YTA**", "Soft YTA\n\nI can get having a need to have an uncontrollable laugh, you could not help it, the problem is you got cought up in his mothers hypocrasy and overlooked the actual damage and fall out of it.\n\nIts not just she is a hipokrit, your BF's entire family, his entire youth his upbringing everything was literraly destroyed in this. He does not know who his father is anymore, and he knows his mother cannot be trusted, and his siblings are not his siblings.\n\nYou got so cought up in laughing at her for her double standards you overlooked the victims of it, which included your BF who needed you desprately at that time and likely still does. Apologise to him for your bad timing and for not realising that supporting him at that time was more important than your feelings regarding his mothers double standards in life.", "NTA. His parents are stuck up hypocrites and got what they deserved. Given all shit that went down I think they have other things to worry that you laughing at them.", "I've seen a new acronym lately, JAM, Justifiable Asshole Move. I'll go with that. I probably would've reacted the same way.", "YTa what is wrong with you", "Soft YTA\n\nI see the irony but unfortunately while you see it he is dealing with a boat load of new information. \n\nHopefully your partner will forgive you. Its probably just a fresh wound that needs a bit of time to heal. Perhaps you will joke about it in a couple of years.", "YTA. You need to grow up. His family is having a major reckoning, and he turned to you for support. You literally laughed in his face because you dislike his mom. It wasn't about her hypocrisy.", "YTA.", "I'm not gonna put a judgment here\n\nbut I agree the irony is delightful", "YTA. \n\nThis must have been incredibly difficult and stressful for your boyfriend. Forget his family etc, your boyfriend, the person you\u2019re meant to love and support, is having a very difficult time and you \u201csupported\u201d him by laughing in his face at the circumstances of his upset. \n\nAH move.", "Is this even a question? Of course YTA. Your boyfriends family is falling apart because your boyfriends brother found out he isn\u2019t actually his brother. \n\nThink about it. Would you be ok if your boyfriend laughed so hard when your mother and father fight because they found out each of them had an affair and kept massively fighting and on top of that the family is starting to fall apart", "NTA. You laughed because it\u2019s ridiculous. Conservative hypocrisy.", "Were you the asshole? Maybe. It's debatable.\n\nBut I really cant blame you for laughing (I would find it hard to not do the same). The whole situation is extremely ridiculous. It sounds like something out of an old black-and-white satirical movie.", "Gentle Yta, I too would be struggling not to laugh at this", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven if you are right about his mom, laughing at your partner's problems makes you an AH ... and it seems his ex.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I can't even comment with my friends because they are mutual friends and i don't know if they know!\" .. you are fine to discuss this with trusted friends.

Nervous laughter is a reflex which can't be helped, and with that level of hypocrisy, his mother can take that stick out of her ass!  I'm sorry for your bf and his siblings, hopefully in time, once things have levelled out he'll understand, BUT, be prepared for this to take a loooong time.", "NTA. Your laughing is the least of this family\u2019s worries. It\u2019s just another example them blaming/calling someone else the problem so they don\u2019t have to focus on their own shit.", "NTA. You might not be the greatest girlfriend in this instant but who wouldn't laugh at this? Besides, it isn't like laughter is a planned action. It's an automatic response and let's be honest... This was funny af. \n\nSo much for all that propriety and those \"old money\" values, huh? LMAOOO\n\nGive your bf time to cool off and when he's ready to talk, tell him you're a nervous laugher.
