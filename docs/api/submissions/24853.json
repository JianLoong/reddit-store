You should have walked away.", "Ouch\n\nI get your inappropriate laughter, have trouble with this sometimes too but yeah YTA \ud83d\ude2c but you already know you messed up. It's hard to get a relationship back from that, he feels disrespected and betrayed. Maybe he'll be able to talk to you and work it through after a bit more time has passed.", "ESH. The parents most of all and OP kinda. Laughing however is an involuntary response though. And OP did apologize after.\n\nOn the downside bf was watching his family falling apart at the seams so no wonder he's pissed.", "YTA\n\nI think you already know your reaction hurt your bf. Even if this reaction was involuntary, it\u2019s wrong & unkind.\n\nYou screwed up. Just own it & keep apologizing. Hopefully, you hear back from him.", "If somebody really enjoys the schadenfreude of conservatives being exposed for being hypocrites, it's me. But as much as I really truly understand this was an involuntary reaction that was a mixture of shock and nerves, I'm afraid YTA. Your bf and his family's whole world has come apart, and I'm sure they are all devastated. I hope you can come back from this, but you have a lot of work to do to try and make it up to him. And that should start with not gossiping to your friends about this- like, ever.", "Can you update us on how this resolves?\n\nSmall YTA, but I think a lot of your boyfriends distance comes from everything going on within the rest of the family.\n\nMaybe he feels embarrassed and thinks you\u2019ll judge him and critique him, and use this as something to embarrass him or attack him with in later arguments. For example, I always personally feel attacked when my wife criticizes my mother, even though many times my mothers behavior is wrong and does warrant some criticism, because my mother is still my mother and no one talks shit about my mother except for me. \n\nMaybe his own understanding and belief in relationships, trust, and commitment are shaken by what happened.\n\nBest you can do is give him space, but offer him an unconditional judgement free zone when he\u2019s ready to make up. \n\nYou apologized, not much more you can do.. just keep in mind no matter what he says/vents about his family, he\u2019ll get upset if you talk about them in similar language.", "YTA. Your BF's family is unravelling and you laugh!  As soon as you started feeling amused by the hypocrisy you should have excused yourself and raced away from the house  to laugh where they could not hear you or see your amusement at their pain. \n\nWork on your poker face.", "Of course YTA. You're supposed to at least make enough of an effort to hold it in or leave.", "YTA Your bff's family just got ripped apart. How do you think he feels? It isn't about them, it's about him. He's decreased, and you laughed.", "I\u2019ve never seen blow out spelled that way!", "YTA - Not the right place for laughter.  While it may feel satisfying to see the inside of the hypocrisy-sausage-factory, your obligation in that moment is to not become a part of the volatile moment and to support your partner.  Laughing at his family's dysfunction in that moment is the opposite of that.", "YTA. Your boyfriends parents sound like the worst kind of people, but laughing in your boyfriends face while his family is falling apart makes you the asshole", "It's completely understandable that you laughed, but also it was the wrong reaction. It honestly would be more appropriate to break into laughter at a funeral.\n\nWhether you intended it or not, you almost certainly made your boyfriend feel humiliated, possibly twice over. Once because you heard how his world was falling apart, and you laughed at him. The second time because if any of his family heard you laughing, then he's the one who brought a non family member into a very, very personal family moment AND when the non family member heard the news she LAUGHED AT THEM. YTA.\n\nEven if he is the kind to agree it's funny and not be humiliated, you should reasonably expect that he's going to be very distracted while his family tries to reconcile (or not). If he was offended, then you moved you out of the supportive safe person to relax around while this nightmare plays out kind of relationship, and into another problem to be sorted.\n\nThis family revelation has a solid chance of making your boyfriend question a bunch of stuff about himself, and maybe even his plans for the future. If he does break up with you, understand that it won't *just* be because you laughed. And it won't mean he wasn't happy before this. Big life events can make us decide to change the direction of our lives.\n\nFinally write the shortest possible message containing the next elements:\n\n1. I assume you already apologised. Maybe not well (look up the 4 step apology) but possibly profusely. If so write your 4 step apology on paper and put it in your pocket or something.\n\n2. If you haven't done the below, do it once.\n\nIf he has a favourite cafe/eatery, ask if you could join him for breakfast or lunch or whatever you two would sometimes do on a crazy busy week. Just to see him, and to give him a hug. Emphasise that it can just be 30 minutes if that's all the time he has, that you'd like to see him because you miss him.\n\n3. Tell him you understand there's a lot going on in his life right now, and you don't want to be an unwanted distraction so you're going to leave him be for the next two weeks unless he wants to reconnect sooner. Which you hope he does, especially if you can meet for coffee.\n\n\nThen leave him alone for 2 weeks unless he reaches out.\n\nAn example:\n\nBoyfriend. I know there's a lot of shit going on in your world, and I don't want to make your life any harder. I miss you, and if you're free next Thursday,  I'd love to meet you at Cafe. We can talk about anything you want, including not talking about anything you don't want to. I would love to see you and give you a hug. If you can't stay for long, I understand.\n\nI'm going to stop blowing up your phone, unless you say you want me to continue. If I haven't heard from you in two weeks, I'll reach out again. I hope I do hear from you. If I can help in any other way, please let me know.", "YTA - Whilst I see the humour, laughing out loud in front of the whole family.....bad move on your part!", "YTA. \n\nI do see the irony and I bet it probably felt, in a way, like karma or justice after the way MIL judged and criticized you. However, people's lives were torn apart in the moment, people were hurting, people's heads were swirling from the information....It wasn't JUST the MIL...Everyone, including your bf, was dealing with the news and everything that meant. There are certain times when laughing isn't appropriate and...This is one of those times.", "YTA. I'm also a nervous laugher, and I can definitely see how that could be one of those situations, but you've gotta read the room. If he had been laughing a bit telling you about the situation, it would have been different, but it sounds like he was upset and you laughed in his face.", "You definitely should've apologized asap, but even if you did I doubt his reaction would've changed. Still tho **YTA**", "Soft YTA\n\nI can get having a need to have an uncontrollable laugh, you could not help it, the problem is you got cought up in his mothers hypocrasy and overlooked the actual damage and fall out of it.\n\nIts not just she is a hipokrit, your BF's entire family, his entire youth his upbringing everything was literraly destroyed in this. He does not know who his father is anymore, and he knows his mother cannot be trusted, and his siblings are not his siblings.\n\nYou got so cought up in laughing at her for her double standards you overlooked the victims of it, which included your BF who needed you desprately at that time and likely still does. Apologise to him for your bad timing and for not realising that supporting him at that time was more important than your feelings regarding his mothers double standards in life.", "NTA. His parents are stuck up hypocrites and got what they deserved. Given all shit that went down I think they have other things to worry that you laughing at them.", "I've seen a new acronym lately, JAM, Justifiable Asshole Move. I'll go with that. I probably would've reacted the same way.", "YTa what is wrong with you", "Soft YTA\n\nI see the irony but unfortunately while you see it he is dealing with a boat load of new information. \n\nHopefully your partner will forgive you. Its probably just a fresh wound that needs a bit of time to heal. Perhaps you will joke about it in a couple of years.", "YTA. You need to grow up. His family is having a major reckoning, and he turned to you for support. You literally laughed in his face because you dislike his mom. It wasn't about her hypocrisy.", "YTA.", "I'm not gonna put a judgment here\n\nbut I agree the irony is delightful", "YTA. \n\nThis must have been incredibly difficult and stressful for your boyfriend. Forget his family etc, your boyfriend, the person you\u2019re meant to love and support, is having a very difficult time and you \u201csupported\u201d him by laughing in his face at the circumstances of his upset. \n\nAH move.", "Is this even a question? Of course YTA. Your boyfriends family is falling apart because your boyfriends brother found out he isn\u2019t actually his brother. \n\nThink about it. Would you be ok if your boyfriend laughed so hard when your mother and father fight because they found out each of them had an affair and kept massively fighting and on top of that the family is starting to fall apart", "NTA. You laughed because it\u2019s ridiculous. Conservative hypocrisy.", "Were you the asshole? Maybe. It's debatable.\n\nBut I really cant blame you for laughing (I would find it hard to not do the same). The whole situation is extremely ridiculous. It sounds like something out of an old black-and-white satirical movie.", "Gentle Yta, I too would be struggling not to laugh at this", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven if you are right about his mom, laughing at your partner's problems makes you an AH ... and it seems his ex.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I can't even comment with my friends because they are mutual friends and i don't know if they know!\" .. you are fine to discuss this with trusted friends.

Your laughing is the least of this family\u2019s worries. It\u2019s just another example them blaming/calling someone else the problem so they don\u2019t have to focus on their own shit.", "NTA.

It can't be much worse for him.", "YTA even though I fully understand laughing in this situation. My natural reaction is to laugh in uncomfortable and messed up situations and there\u2019s been more than one occasion where I\u2019ve beat myself up for laughing at completely inappropriate times. However involuntary or not, it was an AH move and your bf\u2019s upset is justified.", "NTA cause laughter is very often a response in these situations however I don\u2019t think your boyfriend is forgiving you or understanding of it cause he hasn\u2019t even read your apologies. He must have been so hurt and sometimes there just isn\u2019t moving on from there.", "As someone who found out later in life about my mom\u2019s affairs and will not get a DNA test because I love my dad, affairs broke my fucking heart. If my support had laughed at me I don\u2019t know what I would have done. Thankfully, they were 100% supportive in any way they could be and four years later they are sleeping right next to me. Going to go snuggle them and be thankful I don\u2019t have a partner like you OP. YTA", "NTA. Shit happens. Seems more of your bf issue than yours. Honestly those stuck up sorts have the best secrets  :) the bf seems like he is the one who has the problem. Idk", "Giggle isn't \"loud laughter\" though", "Haha thank you! Me too, me too! Happy hunting. <3", "YTA. I get it was nervous laughter but I still feel bad for him. You humiliated him. Just apologize and try to move on.", "YTA ,,,", "Na, you slipped up and apologised. You also offered support to him and his siblings so not much more you can do \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f give him his space and see what he does, none of us are perfect and sh*t happens. His parents just proved that x", "How is laughing at the fact your bf's family is falling apart justified?", ">The initial \u201cloud\u201d laugh was bc of the mother\u2019s hypocrisy. Her instinct was to take joy in the mother\u2019s comeuppance rather than sympathize with her boyfriend\u2019s pain.\n\nWritten by someone that doesn't laugh? \n\nAgain, genuine laughter is an involuntary reaction. The fact that OP finds humor in hipocrisy has no bearing on whether she sympathizes with her bf or not. \n\nOnly fake laughter could've been cold and there's no indication that it was fake.", ">Yeah, that is cold as hell\n\nActually, it's very obviously pathological. Which means you're quite literally unable to observe and see what the people around you need in order to help them. Otherwise, you would've made that connection ages ago. \n\nYou should really make more of an effort to be empathetic in your actions instead of your words. The latter doesn't count for much.", ">inappropriate reactions to certain revelations happen.\n\nYep, but adults should be mature enough like you to be able to control it when it's highly inappropriate and you can see the hurt reaction of the other person (especially a loved one) right there.", "Oh please, you're not a baby or toddler to laugh uncontrollably. Adults can suppress the instinct to laugh if they want to. A chuckle or laughter bubbling up? Maybe not. Loud laughter at inappropriate times when you can see the other person getting hurt by it? YTA!", ">Adults can suppress the instinct to laugh if they want to.\n\nAnd all other adults can see you surpress that laugh unless you actually train to do it really subtly.\n\nWhat's your point?", ">What's your point?\n\nThe point is the other person can see that is involuntary and that you are making an effort to be considerate of their feelings by trying to suppress it. It hits different from being laughed at for your misfortune.", "So exactly what OP did after the initial outburst. How cold of her! \n\nIt took me until age 30 to get my nervous laughter under full control and have quite a bit of experience with rude people thinking that means I'm cold. They sounded exactly like you. And they were clearly being rude.\n\nHer bf has an excuse, you don't. End of discussion.", "No, OP's first round of loud laughter wasn't nervous laughter. They were laughing at the comeuppance of her bf's mother, despite seeing their bf's pain and discomfort at their reaction. They didn't even attempt to stop it. Then they laughed nervously after registering bf's reaction. And it's only now, after they went on a work trip and the bf wasn't responding to their texts that they are even wondering if their reaction was wrong. Complete lack of empathy and self-awareness and maturity."]}
