{"id": 2087, "submission_id": "ysud9u", "title": "AITA - GF mad that female friend asked to wear my sweatpants... and I said yes", "selftext": "I have been dating a girl for around 7 months now and things are pretty serious. Early in our relationship, she would spend just about every night at my apartment for \\~2 months in a row. Then we decided her place was better to spend so much of our time at, so I have been spending just about every night at her place for the past \\~2 months. This has been great, as we enjoy spending so much time together.\n\nCoincidentally, a female friend of mine needed a place to stay after her lease ended since she will only be here for 6-8 more weeks before moving across the country.\n\nSince I spend every night at my gf's house, and my apartment is not being used, I decided my female friend could help me pay rent and stay at my apartment to avoid having to pay very high rent prices in the short time before she left.\n\nRecently, my female friend asked if she could wear a pair of sweatpants that I left behind, and I said yes, not thinking anything of it. I mentioned it in passing to my gf, who told me it was weird. She was fine the rest of the night, but the next day I got the silent treatment and she proceeded to get mad and declare that it was breaching a boundary. She decided to only tell me this after apparently concealing her feelings the night before and after I asked multiple times to explain what was bothering her.\n\nAltogether, my gf made a big deal of it, cried, and asked me to not let her wear my clothes.\n\nAITA? I saw nothing wrong with lending a friend some sweatpants that I don't use and thought nothing of it. I feel that my gf is disproportionately upset for what happened and emotionally immature for handling things this way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Removal of a point. I initially stated in the post that 1) the friend is platonic and has never crossed boundaries 2) is kind which MIGHT be construed as having a crush on me (gf has previously asked if this was the case, to which I replied no) 3) the friend has been good friends with my girlfriend. **Within minutes after posting**, I decided to remove this point because the vast majority of comments hyperfocused on this friend matter-of-factly having a crush on me, which was never stated but somehow inferred from the above 3 points. I wanted a broader perspective from Redditors. I don't need to be told that entertaining a girl with a crush is wrong. I initially included this point because it was a justification from my gf for being upset with me. My gf claimed that she probably has a crush on me, which I further explained I do not believe is the case. There are many pieces of evidence that suggest we are platonic friends, such as her having guys over to my apartment that she sleeps with. Did not think I had to go this far to justify removing a few words.\n\nAdditional context: the friend put a lot of her stuff in a storage locker, and does not have a washer and dryer at my apartment, so she has to leave to go do laundry. Someone commented on this and thought it was relevant so I am putting that here. However, this was never discussed between the friend and I. I simply said yes and did not ask questions.", "created_utc": 1668220581, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ysud9u/aita_gf_mad_that_female_friend_asked_to_wear_my/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Never anyone else of the opposite sex. It's a respect thing. Because as a woman I know women take things like that differently than men.

She knew what she was doing.\n\nThere are men who don't like their women wearing another man's clothes even if other man was a relative. That is something intimate. \n\nIt probably did bother your gf from the beginning, but she didn't know how you would react so didn't say anything, but the longer she thought about it the worse it got, so she finally had to say something. Or she could have been serving guessing herself and finally came to a decision the next day.\n\nNow you know it's a boundary don't do it again.\n\nQuestion though. How did she come across your sweat pants in first place? Was she snooping in your room? Did you leave them out in the open?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Never suggested or led to anything, and nobody thought it did or would either.    And as another poster said, if you'll use a towel in their home, why are clean sweats any different?\n\nWhen she supposedly had a crush on him, I could see why this would be a concern to some people - but I honestly don't get why people think this is such a weird thing.", "It would be the same if you had a towel just for washing your crotch then you let a woman borrow it so she could only wash her crotch with it. But yeah, this is a situation where it is more about the connotation of the gesture than the gesture itself."]}
