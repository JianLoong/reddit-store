I don\u2019t want my very large best friend as my bridesmaid\n\n\nI (F 27) am aware how this may sound guys, but hear me out. \nMy entire life I have been supportive of my best friend, we shall call her A, 26, who is morbidly obese and 6ft. We met when we were 10 and even then she was a larger girl, but as time went on she has just got larger and fatter. I\u2019m conscious of how uncomfortable with society\u2019s standards it must be for her to be so tall, but her physical health is declining significantly. To spend time together we must be sat, she needs crutches to walk as her knees can\u2019t support her weight and she frequently complains about all of her ailments. I have tried to inspire her by helping her get onto a path of a healthier lifestyle, inviting her on gentle walks and encouraging her to be more active and eat more consciously. I even moved in with A, for a period of 2 months, and she was doing really well during the day times accompanying me on slow walks and I also taught her how to weight lift at the gym, her confidence grew and I was so proud of her, but every single night she would- once I was asleep- order two large dominos pizzas and eat them, binning them in the morning. I never snooped and she didn\u2019t try to hide it, so I offered her larger portions of what we were eating during the day and yet still she would have two pizzas at night. Daily I think she was consuming around 8000 calories, and is about 390lbs. Another issue I face with her is encouraging her to clean. In her apartment she is too fat to fit in the shower, but doesn\u2019t bother to bathe in any other way. I snapped at her once as I had a plus one to a party, invited her and we met up a few hours before attending. When she got to my place there was a foul smell of BO and I suggested she should shower, offering her mine, which she can fit in. She called me rude and left, upset, a few days later we spoke and I snapped at her, I can\u2019t deal with her tantrums and said it would have been inconsiderate for me to bring her to a dinner party when she was unhygienic.\n\nAfter I left her place she went straight back to her old habits and stopped leaving her house, stopped weight lifting and going to the gym. \nAll I care about is her health, happiness and well-being, but it\u2019s exhausting trying to help and adult function. \n\nI am now getting married, and have 5 girls who will be my bridesmaids, A keeps on talking about how excited she is, assuming she is going to be one. For comparison, she is 6ft, 380lbs and I am 5ft1, 110lbs, she will swamp me in all pictures, the dresses that I have found do not accommodate her size and I am also conscious about her BO being unpleasant. \n\nAm I an awful human being? I don\u2019t want to hurt her.", "created_utc": 1674536759, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jxrh2/aita_i_dont_want_my_very_large_best_friend_as_my/", "score": 350, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In what world is it ok to invite someone to a wedding, much less participate in the bridal party if the person is known to not clean themselves and stinking like BO is their normal operating procedure?  This is disgusting.\n\nOP, she needs help and until she gets that help then she can join society as a normally participating member.  Your friend cant even take care of herself properly.  You need bridesmaids who can assist you on the day of your wedding, not require assistance for themselves.  E.g. if you have bridesmaids enter the reception or service paired with a groomsman, this poor friend cant even walk in to make an entrance.  \n\nIf it was improper to bring her to a dinner party, then its certainly not right to bring her to a wedding.  This is your day, an expensive day at that and a day you want to remember for the right reasons for the rest of your life.  You want people to focus on you and your wedding.  NTA", "NTA.

There is no way she isn\u2019t going to be emotionally hurt but maybe the tough love will help.\n\nIt sounds like, at the least, she has a food addiction. Has she thought about therapy??\n\nThis is a bigger issue than your wedding. \n\nEverything aside, it\u2019s your wedding and what you want goes. \n\nYou need to tell her you love her, but no, you do not want her to be in your wedding. You also need to tell her that you\u2019re worried about her and you want to help: she needs help or her life could be cut very short (from what you\u2019ve said about her mobility- like the Dr on My 600 Lb Lifr says, once you\u2019re immobile, you\u2019re done)", "NTA. I'm a bigger girl, not that big, but beyond plus size, so my opinion is not sizeist. Ultimately, you're the bride and it's your day. You're not being a bridezilla, you're being practical. Would she even manage to stand during the ceremony?? Or would she be expecting to be sitting beside you while you're getting married? Those pictures would not look good, especially considering the size difference. Especially regarding a day that is, all about you and your fiancee. You are unable to find a suitable dress in her size that you like. The only way of getting around that is to get them custom made, which is very costly. Would she pay for the price difference of a custom made dress for your other bridesmaids and hers? I guarantee it would be at least double. \n\nIt is not your job to baby her delicate feelings regarding her lack of hygiene or rampant self neglect.

I struggled with binge eating and my weight for the majority of my life but two pizzas is next level. If she\u2019s on crutches and can\u2019t walk around easily (especially in heels which is common for bridal parties) I don\u2019t understand why she would even want to be a part of the bridal party anyway?

I don't have sympathy for excluding a friend for aesthetic reasons.\n\n>the dresses that I have found do not accommodate her size\n\nThis is a legitimate logistical issue, but it also seems like there are ways to work around it.\n\n* Have a dress tailored to her size\n* Allow her to wear a similar colored/styled dress that isn't 100% the same\n* Choose a dress that can accommodate her\n\nAll of these require some extra work or concession on your part. You are the best judge of how much work/how big of a concession it would be. I do not think you would be the AH for choosing not to take this on, but understand that the less you are willing to accommodate your friend, the less it will seem like you care about your friend.\n\n>I am also conscious about her BO being unpleasant\n\nAgain I think this is a legitimate concern, but you are not giving her a chance to correct the issue. You can ask her to bath herself before coming. She might get upset again, and that is on her, but it is more respectful than just silently excluding her.\n\nSince her health makes it difficult for her to clean herself you might, *if you feel up to it*, offer or arrange for her to get some help, for example if she doesn't have access to a large enough shower.\n\nAn indirect option is to have the bridesmaids go swimming the day before the wedding.\n\n\\---\n\nOverall^(2) you are Not TA^(3), but if you want to include your friend there are other options you might consider.\n\n^(1: Most of your post was irrelevant to the question. It doesn't matter whether or not her obesity is her \"fault\".)\n\n^(2: with the exception of \"she will swamp me in all pictures\"... there you are TA)\n\n^(3: My ruling is NAH because the friend isn't an asshole for being fat)", "NTA for the wedding/bridesmaids but, but perhaps it\u2019s time to be honest to yourself and her that you guys are no longer as close and you no longer have room/mental capacity for her in your life.\n\nIt\u2019s ok you know. Friendships run their course and people drift apart and perhaps it\u2019s sad but it\u2019s part of life.

It is your wedding, it should be exactly what you want\u2026but there\u2019s no chance your friend won\u2019t forget about this exclusion and she will feel awful. You say you don\u2019t want to do hurt her but you realize if you tell her she can\u2019t be a part of this, you are going to hurt her feelings. Just be prepared for that.", "NTA. You seem genuinely concerned about her health and you tried all you can to help her with her issues. She continues with her lifestyle and proceeds to lash out on you.\n\nWhile your comments about her looks are a bit shallow, I kind of get it. Your relationship is strained and that can turn into resentment which ultimately leads for us to look at someone in a negative way.", "I'm pretty sure most people will disagree with me, but whatever. NTA. While you could have a bit better of an attitude about it, I was friends with a girl who was 448  lbs at the time (weighed at a hospital) and she would only shower every 4 to 7 days. When she moved out we could not get her smell out of the room she stayed in. We use bleach and cleaning products on the floor, windows, walls, ceiling, doors, etc. It would NOT come out. When we took her out for lunch we would often have people comment about the smell. We tried to be supportive of her because she was pretty depressed but it was so bad that I'd say it wasn't fair to those in public around her.\n\nAnyway, be kind about how you bring it up with her but if she's not taking care of herself in any way you don't want her smell to be what people remember about the wedding.\n\n(With the girl I know they eventually had to tear the drywall and flooring out then repainted the room after the place sold. This level of smell is pretty intense if anyone hasn't been around it before was curious.)", "NTA but I think you need to accept that this friendship would be over then \n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to invite her to the wedding, not due to the obesity issue but due to the hygiene issue. You\u2019ve also really tried to help her. But she\u2019s entitled to be hurt", "Being a bridesmaid is by invitation only, you already have 5 girls. It doesn't sound like you're as close as you used to be, it's ok if she's just a guest.\n\nI can understand its a big turn off she doesn't bathe and reeks.  You can't help someone who doesn't help themselves.  \n\nIf you don't want her in the wedding id focus on other reasons than her body size. ESH", "NTA. You can have whoever you want as a bridesmaid for whatever reason you want. Unfortunately as heartless as it sounds, she decides everyday to alienate herself and dig herself into a deeper lonelier hole.

That way she wouldn\u2019t have to stand beside you and struggle. She could have the same color as your bridesmaids but it wouldn\u2019t have to match perfectly. That way you could still include her. I\u2019m going to be honest, I have mixed feelings but I understand. Especially about the BO, which I\u2019m not sure there is a way around that one.

Often the biggest factor in physical health can be mental health. Her wellbeing is far above your pay grade. I\u2019m giving a soft YTA here because I feel like you genuinely care about her. Not having her in the wedding will make her feel awful. She is not equipped to handle that. You will feel awful for making your friend feel that way. I don\u2019t know how to help her friend but maybe start with an open and honest conversation about how you feel about her mental health. I really hope her being fat isn\u2019t the reason you don\u2019t want her in the wedding. Being fat is a often a symptom of other things.

Bridesmaid is supposed to be a supportive position. Not just in an emotional sense but in the full capability to get stuff done leading up to and on the wedding day.

There are some people who prioritize a certain aesthetic for a wedding and want to make sure their pictures fit that mold. That\u2019s your prerogative, and, while it\u2019s not my style, I\u2019m trying not to be too judgmental about it. With that said, when you look back at your photos, do you want to think \u201cdamn, look how fit everyone in the wedding party is\u201d or do you just want to remember a fun celebration of love with the people you care about most. Obviously those things aren\u2019t mutually exclusive, but you get the idea. Just know that based on what you wrote about here regarding her expectations, it seems like excluding your best friend will likely have consequences for your friendship.\n\nAnother way to think about it: is it going to stress you out more trying to accommodate her during the ceremony and worrying about photos and hygiene, etc., or is it going to be more stressful to wonder how she\u2019ll react to being excluded and potentially lose a (best) friend? If you do decide not to include her in the wedding party, is there another way you can recognize her as your best friend instead to soften the blow (ask her to give a toast, etc.)?", "YTA.  Kinda.

The truth is that there is quite literally nothing you can do about your friend's weight. That is going to be her own struggle to hopefully overcome someday. You will never be able to make her lose weight, she has to make that choice for herself. I think you would be a bad friend if you kept her out of the wedding just because she's \"big\" and would distract people. No one would care, you are the one in the wedding dress that will stand out. If your main concern is the lack of hygiene, then that'd be justified. I wouldn't want to have the smell of bad BO be a lasting memory on my wedding day. However, that is just part of the deal you make when you are friends with an individual too large to fit their shower. \n\nYou need to decide whether it's worth maintaining a friendship with this person. If you love her enough, then you'll have to cope with those issues you have with her and don't try to make her feel bad about them.

You have to think of the rest of your wedding party if her BO is that offensive.  It will just put a damper on a day that is supposed to be all about you and your soon to be husband.  Congrats on the upcoming wedding!\n\nEdit to add... I just noticed the part where is said she is expecting to be a bridesmaid. If it were me and my best friend, I would just have an honest conversation with her and let her know as gently as possible that you already have your bridesmaids selected.

Eg, if I knew someone was a heavy smoker, and someone was allergic to cigarette smoke, I don\u2019t think I could sit them next to eachother.

Regardless of the issues, it's your day. You're going to hurt her regardless. Ppl who are morbidly obese are constantly hurt by family, friends and society. We fear for their physical and mental health and unless they want to be healthier, there's not much you can do. They will see it as fat shaming, and there's definitely many who do that, but that's not your intention. \n\nYou're going to have to have a hard and painful conversation with her.", "I think this is a case of not just her weight-but her mobility and ability to perform as bridesmaid.

I don\u2019t want my very large best friend as my bridesmaid\n\n\nI (F 27) am aware how this may sound guys, but hear me out. \nMy entire life I have been supportive of my best friend, we shall call her A, 26, who is morbidly obese and 6ft. We met when we were 10 and even then she was a larger girl, but as time went on she has just got larger and fatter. I\u2019m conscious of how uncomfortable with society\u2019s standards it must be for her to be so tall, but her physical health is declining significantly. To spend time together we must be sat, she needs crutches to walk as her knees can\u2019t support her weight and she frequently complains about all of her ailments. I have tried to inspire her by helping her get onto a path of a healthier lifestyle, inviting her on gentle walks and encouraging her to be more active and eat more consciously. I even moved in with A, for a period of 2 months, and she was doing really well during the day times accompanying me on slow walks and I also taught her how to weight lift at the gym, her confidence grew and I was so proud of her, but every single night she would- once I was asleep- order two large dominos pizzas and eat them, binning them in the morning. I never snooped and she didn\u2019t try to hide it, so I offered her larger portions of what we were eating during the day and yet still she would have two pizzas at night. Daily I think she was consuming around 8000 calories, and is about 390lbs. Another issue I face with her is encouraging her to clean. In her apartment she is too fat to fit in the shower, but doesn\u2019t bother to bathe in any other way. I snapped at her once as I had a plus one to a party, invited her and we met up a few hours before attending. When she got to my place there was a foul smell of BO and I suggested she should shower, offering her mine, which she can fit in. She called me rude and left, upset, a few days later we spoke and I snapped at her, I can\u2019t deal with her tantrums and said it would have been inconsiderate for me to bring her to a dinner party when she was unhygienic.\n\nAfter I left her place she went straight back to her old habits and stopped leaving her house, stopped weight lifting and going to the gym. \nAll I care about is her health, happiness and well-being, but it\u2019s exhausting trying to help and adult function. \n\nI am now getting married, and have 5 girls who will be my bridesmaids, A keeps on talking about how excited she is, assuming she is going to be one. For comparison, she is 6ft, 380lbs and I am 5ft1, 110lbs, she will swamp me in all pictures, the dresses that I have found do not accommodate her size and I am also conscious about her BO being unpleasant. \n\nAm I an awful human being? I don\u2019t want to hurt her.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have never smelled bad, being big means you have to wipe under the areas that smell. \n\nI will say you are not a true friend. A true friend will have the hard conversation about her smelling and self care. Even if it means not having them as a friend I had a large friend like this and I told her. We had a long conversation and I said she can be fat, but she needs to take care of herself. You can get skin infections from not cleaning in areas where sweat and BO builds. This is a health issue. We are still friends and hit the gym together. I told her she can\u2019t go anywhere with me smelling and that changed. \n\n\nIf it was just the smell you could set down and ultimatum that she needs to clean regularly if she wants to be apart of the wedding party.

Besides the point but we have to go and get help of our own accord. \n\nAlso maybe suggest therapy because it sounds more like she\u2019s depressed and in a mental crisis.

You're right that OP should, if they feel up to it, offer some of the solutions you've provided. Adding to that, OP should approach this *very delicately.* OP (if they care) should be extremely careful with their word choices and tone when they suggest, with empathy and love, that it's important to them that everyone who comes to the wedding is clean and enjoyable to be around. Plus-sized folks (usually) aren't oblivious; they often know if they struggle with personal hygiene and body odor control, and they're likely very self-conscious about that struggle. Being reminded of that can be incredibly painful and isolating. That said, it's still a 100% reasonable request that the friend make sure that they can find a way to address/control that for the wedding. \n\nI would say, for now, NAH... unless OP seriously miffs it with how they choose to handle this concern with their friend.

They disproportionately use public resources on personal choices.   \n  \nSomeone born with no arms is not a burden on medical resources because that\u2019s shit luck.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m here to be downvoted to hell. But the only valid concern you have is hygiene. Everything else is bullshit. \n\nChoosing bridesmaids according to their weight/appearance/ability to stand tells me you care more about how well the pictures will come out than your friends. And yeah, sure it\u2019s your wedding. You can choose who you want. But the fact that you can choose does not make you less of an asshole. \n\nFor me friends are soemthing else. They are people I want with me, in my photos, even when they are not able to stand. Or they look bad. Or they are ill.", "Assume all you want to feel better about yourself. Look at you trying to tell someone else how to think then assume the worst to justify it. You\u2019re a shitty person in your own way but be ignorant and tell yourself all the lies to sleep better. It doesn\u2019t impact me.", "I would argue that a high mortality rate causes a morbidly obese person to consume *fewer* resources over the course of their life. Old people cost a ton of resources on the health system, especially old people who keep recovering.\n\n>Fat people burdens the hospital too. That\u2019s a waste of public resources\n\nYou might want to be careful with how you phrase things. This can really easily be read as \"Saving fat people is a waste of resources\".\n\nI am sure you are making a more nuanced point, but even \"people have a moral obligation to not become obese so that they don't consume more public resources\" is a bit of a slippery slope. Where does the moral obligation to be healthy end?\n\nFor example not getting enough sleep has been shown to have negative impacts on health. Similarly many athletes damage their health while seeking peak physical performance. Have they wronged society by not taking perfect care of their health, while still relying on public health care?", "I have my flaws like anyone else. but hey, at least I don't exclude people I claim to love from important events because they can't walk and I recognize that, as humans, we absolutely do owe things to one another."]}
