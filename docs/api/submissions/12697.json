Thought this was going to be about a q-anon child or something lmao", "NTA...good for you for saying what needed to be said.", "NTA You said what everyone was thinking. Sometimes that's good sometimes it might come back to bite you. Hopefully this will die down and she will pick up her slack.", "NTA, I get that at my office, I\u2019m on the other end of the spectrum I am older, widowed and my children are grown. So whenever somebody needs to stay after work, they always say \u201coh well she can do it because she doesn\u2019t have a family or kids at home.\u201d", "i read the post 3 times trying to work out what a q child was, thinking my eyes missed something, but then realised its a typo.", "NTA. I\u2019m a parent, and she\u2019s handling the balance problem poorly and unprofessionally. Acting like her non-parenting colleagues\u2019 time is worth less than hers is really entitled.", "I mean, her life isn't *nearly as hard* as Gwyneths, with all the going on set and being an A-lister. That is much, much harder, as she told us.\n\n/s", "I always felt awful for our former assistant controller because her boss had three kids and the assistant had no kids, but she did have two large dogs that required a lot of exercise so she would normally take them to the park or for a run after work.\n\nBut she\u2019d CONSTANTLY be given work or told she could stay later because she \u201cdidn\u2019t have kids\u201d and she used to bitch to me about it all the time.  My boss was more understanding that even though I didn\u2019t have kids and everyone in my department did, it didn\u2019t matter and shouldn\u2019t affect my workload/time spent at work compared to others.", "what kind of non-sequitur is this, an anti-Goop bot? think before you blather on.", "Came to say this.  One off would never qualify and, since it was not taking away from her  money or promotion away either, would be nothing to fight here in this one time situation.", "> Asst Manager 2 (me- lead a team of 3)\n\nReally, OP clearly states that they are in the management stream", "But OP is in the management stream in the company *Asst Manager 2 (me- lead a team of 3).*", "ESH\n\nThe coworker isn't wrong for turning down extra work without extra pay, at all.  She's also not wrong for turning down extra work that comes with extra pay.  She is allowed to refuse longer hours regardless of the incentive offered.  However, she is shooting herself in the foot to blame her kid, even if the caregiving workload at home is the reason why she doesn't take on extra responsibilities or longer hours than contracted for.\n\nOP should not have called her out publicly or made a personal attack for a business issue.", "Not sure. You said it wasn't your direct report, so maybe you weren't professional in response either? Of course she's not being reasonable or professional, but that's up to her team and leadership to manage or move her on.", "Not sure but given that you have a management position, you may want to discuss the matter with HR because whether or not anyone is married, single, divorced or in a polygamous relationship has no business being discussed at the office. I get that she\u2019s the one who brings it up but as a manager, you or your company may have some kind of legal exposure based on what you said to her. I highly recommend taking a workshop or two.", "YTA because you know full well that isn\u2019t something you should say (having children is protected) and you just made some paperwork for someone so you could be an ass. It wasn\u2019t your problem. And technically, no worker should be forced to be on call so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f guess her team lead can work it out. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m really doubting she used those words. It sounds like something you\u2019re saying to mock her out of a sense of superiority, and because what she said was actually far more reasonable.", "YTA being a parent is hard, and to be fair it isn't her business, why should she have to sacrifice family time for the machine. I would have kept my spoiled childless mouth shut. Also I don't have children, just compassion for young families", "NTA", "NTA-If it's to much, she should leave.", "YTA.  The issue is her not pulling her weight, not the specific excuse she uses.  You should have focused on that.", "NTA, women like that are insufferable! No one cares that you're a parent!", "wow\u2026 \u201cno, I don\u2019t want this *bad* kind of discrimination that\u2019s *against* me! I want the *good* kind that\u2019s in *my* favor! Because\u2026\u201d \\*fluffs up an already overinflated sense of self-importance\\* \u201cI\u2019m a **MoMmYYYYYYY!!**\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA. Discrimination would be not giving her the same opportunities. She got the opportunities and turned them down whilst discriminating against all of you for not being a mother.\n\nThe world doesn\u2019t just stop. Get child care, work out stuff with a partner, get family involved.\n\nMany women in their 30s suddenly realise there is a lot more to life than working their butt off for material grind, when their kids are more important. They want a work life balance. That comes at the expense of promotions, because the higher up you get, the more stress and hours you have. Excuses don\u2019t cut it.", "I have had to decline early meetings at times because my kids are still at home until a certain time, but my husband and I alternate days we can be to work early and I offer to stay late or come early on days I can.  It's true having kids does affect when I can work outside of contract hours, but I do typically work 10-15 hours outside my contract hours each week and try to accommodate others for appointments, leave, etc, kid related or not, I don't think it bothers my team too much when I do ask to be accomodated due to my kids.", "I mean OP says she's on a team with less pay and less responsibilities, so it sounds like she did.", "I get that. But who got paid more and promoted? I don\u2019t blame the other woman for coming in late and leaving early if she faced no repercussions for it. It is nice to be liked in the office, but if you aren\u2019t there for even 40 hours a week, who cares.", "Saying things like that in front of everyone at a meeting is super unprofessional. She could just say \"okay if you can't take on the extra work how about this person\" then discuss it later. Making a personal attack at someone, especially someone who may have a legitimate reason not to be able to work more hours, just creates a negative environment and looks bad.", "I feel like I was losing brain cells reading everyone say she was blaming her kid when it's like *no her literal child needs her more than extra work*. OP getting all butthurt over a situation when she's not even her manager is frankly ridiculous.", "This!!! It is not okay for superiors to do this. It is grounds for a lawsuit in some cases.", "Well, saying \"I can't perform these duties as I have children\" is perfectly legitimate when asked to do voluntary extra work on the spot. Past situations are irrelevant.", "She didn\u2019t use racial slurs though\u2026 stating you\u2019re a parent is different than a higher up employee going after you for it.", "I used to work with this lady who would run off on a \"break\" to help her daughter and be gone for hours. Her daughter was in her mid twenties and worked in the call center.", "That's me, except it's snow and I work from home on those days.  It's also because I have trouble walking when it's cold or snowy not because I don't like driving in it.", "She made what appears to be a discriminatory statement. That those with children cannot/should not be expected to work like others. \n\nBasically creating an opportunity for the boss to say we don\u2019t discriminate against people without children here. Expectations are the same for all. \n\nWhile it would be much worse if she said purple people don\u2019t do overtime that\u2019s what green people are for, it\u2019s very similar and must be addressed as a group", "Except people higher up need to handle these things more carefully. She said she can\u2019t do it and explained why, and if someone can\u2019t then they can\u2019t. Op crossed a line into a legal discrimination suit when she brought up the fact that the coworker chose to have kids and that\u2019s no one else\u2019s fault. OP made a lot of paperwork for someone because, since OP is in management as far as I can tell, that opens the company up for a lawsuit because of the power dynamic involved.", "Bringing up an actual fact isn\u2019t discrimination. \n\nShe did chose to have kids. \n\nIt isn\u2019t the fault or responsibility of anyone that works there. \n\nI said ESH. OP should have done it in a better manner but it needs to be said. \n\nYour choices (whether they be kids, etc) are not anyone at works problem. Either do the tasks assigned or find another job.", "YTA. Weird to me that anyone\u2019s saying otherwise. A lot of people really hate mothers. If you aren\u2019t paraphrasing, sure, she sounds annoying, but you had no right to humiliate her in front of your fellow colleagues and childcare is a legitimate reason to not take on extra work.", "INFO: is she salaried or hourly?", "I agree with the OP's sentiment. I also agree with what she said,  however, being as blunt as she is, I also know you can't say it like she did.  That was likely quite satisfying, however also quite unprofessional. In Corp America, you use an iron fist in a velvet glove.  Also, it wasn't her place to go there, certainly not in such a public forum.  Sentiment: NTA. Delivery: YTA", "NTA", "NTA, but as someone already pointed out, she isn't your report.  These situations are tricky, and her team lead ought to have stepped in before you did.  When I was a lead, I had to learn to step in graciously, and I was fortunate to have managers who helped me with that.  Not every lead is so fortunate.\n\nThere is an art to standing passively while the other party makes a fool of themselves in front of the team, along with their managers.  It requires a completely neutral face or even an an icing stare, but no words.  OP, I encourage you to cultivate that stare.  Then turn it on Ms. I-have-kids-I-can't-do-that whenever she insists on not pulling her weight.  For your part, being uber-competent helps, too.  A decade into my first job, nobody, but nobody wanted to get on my bad side, because an icy stare from uber-competent me made managers wonder about the other person.", "NTA. Discrimination would be forcing her to work or not work because she has children. What she is doing is *refusing* work because she is a parent.", "Eh.. Kind of ESH.\n\nYou said this in front all staff? In many places that's workplace bullying. *You* were unprofessional there.\n\nAnd she's not even your direct report?!\n\nI certainly don't like the \u201cI can\u2019t be on call extra, I\u2019m a mommy\" line, but you were really unprofessional there, having a pop at someone in front of all staff, and you're not even her manager.\n\nShe was annoying, definitely, but I'd say you absolutely fucked up here, in some companies this would be considered bullying.", "Exactly.", "I got recalled to my office less than a month after the COVID \"lockdowns\" shut things down and was specifically told \"you don't have kids, it doesn't matter as much if you get sick.\"\n\nI didn't stay at that company much longer.", "The amount of people in this comment section that take OP at face value and can\u2019t read that mocking tone is sad.", "I agree. She probably shouldn't say \"because I'm a mommy\", she should say \"I can't work beyond my usual hours because of daycare, bedtime, etc\". Childcare doesn't just appear out of thin air.", "I agree. That\u2019s is why I said ESH. That being said OP really fucked, it will now likely reflect worse on them", "Also who uses the word \"mommy\" to other adults?!"]}
