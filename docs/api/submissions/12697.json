I say this as someone who took my full maternity leave and used appropriate PTO for sick days and appointments.", "NTA.  She's actually discriminating against childless coworkers by expecting special treatment because she's a parent.  Word of warning:  If you're on the same vacation calendar as she is, schedule the days you want early and guard them zealously.  She will expect to play the parent card and take whatever days she wants, even if that means yours get cancelled.\n\nI'm childless.  That doesn't mean I don't have other things going on in my life.  I used to have two coworkers with kids.  One (who was married) frequently came in late \"because of the drop off\" at school.  Then she'd leave early because she needed to \"pick him up.\"  Her kid was in 8th grade.  She refused to work overtime, even when we were prepping for trial.  The other coworker dropped her kids off with whoever was driving carpool and chipped in extra since she couldn't drive it.  Her kids were in an afterschool enrichment program that her husband could pick them up from.  If something came up, she would call him and say, \"Can you start dinner?  I'll be a bit late.\"  If we were doing trial prep, she'd already meal prepped on the weekend before and her husband handled dinner and bedtime on his own.

She isn't entitled to special treatment because she has a kid.  She has a job, and is required to fulfill the job requirements just as other employees do.", "NTA. You said what everyone was thinking. C sounds like a pain in the ass", "NTA.  She accused you of discriminating against her, but she is the one discriminating against you, saying you should get the extra work because you're childless.

She should stop playing the mommy card to get out of doing her job. And you should take it up with management or with HR if she's behaving unprofessionally towards you. Most likely everyone wanted to say something but so many people these days are afraid of discrimination lawsuits. The best way to deal with the mommy card abusers is to refuse to do their work when they ask you and ignore any backhanded comments.", "ESH. It\u2019s legitimate that she may not be able to work her hours due to commitments. I can\u2019t get to the office before 10:00 on the days I\u2019m required to go in due to lack of childcare. I do work extra hours to make it up where I can across the week. It isn\u2019t easy being her parent, it doesn\u2019t mean the way she speaks about it is any less annoying. \n\nThat being what you did say, was totally unprofessional as well. You could have stopped before you got to the part about her being a parent and it would have been a totally valid argument. But you did say it and frankly she does have grounds for discrimination.", "NTA. My former manager used to pull that card at every opportunity presented. Never covered a single call out or stayed late. Instead she would just tell the childless employees already working overtime to do it.", "NTA.

This unfortunately happens to single people too often, me included, where people assume I have more time because I'm single, and therefore can take on more work.

Would've had a separate conversation with your manager about this, and set some boundary that you are not picking up someone else's slack for this reason, and that you don't appreciate her backhanded comments about being a mom.  This is easier said than done because the manager might be encouraging this behavior.
