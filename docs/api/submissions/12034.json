About an year and a half ago, I had a feeling that she was getting  distant . When I asked her if everything was okay, she insisted it was.  But then she ghosted me completely two days after that.\n\nShe went completely no contact for two weeks. I tried to reach out several times but there was no answer.  She came back after two weeks, just showed up like nothing had happened. She didn't even tell me what that was all about. When I questioned her about it, she said that she just needed some time and changed the topic.  She told me she wouldn't do it again, only to do it again literally less than a month later> She ignored all my calls and texts. The silent treatment continued for weeks.\n\n This time when A came back, she assured me it had nothing to do with me, just like she had the first time. I gave her an ultimatum that she talk to me instead of ghosting me without any apparent reason or we're done. I thought she might be cheating on me. When I asked her if she was, she instantly became defensive and told me she would never do anything like that.\n\nThings were going pretty good for a few months after that. We were communicating with each other, and my college was going well.\n\nThen one of our mutuals sent a screenshot of A making out with some dude from her private story. When I confronted her about it, she merely shrugged and told me that she was just \"checking out the other side\" with me she had discovered that she wasn't actually queer. And she left.\n\nI was miserable for months afterwards, because I had truly been in love with her. It hurt me so much I couldn't trust anyone else for a really long time. I still can't.\n\nFast forward to a few days ago when one of our old friends I'd fallen out of touch with texts me. We catch up and make plans to meet. She then adds me to a group chat with a dozen people, some of who I knew and some who were new. Then she tells me that A was going to get married and she wanted a photographer to capture the whole thing.\n\nI explained to her that I'm not a professional photographer and that I photograph birds, not people. I go birdwatching with my dad and it's more of a hobby than anything else.\n\nOne of the other people in the gc said that it couldn't be that hard to click photos. Immediately everyone else supported her and told me I should just do it, especially because A and I had been \"really good friends.\"\n\nWhen I continued to refuse, one of them told me that I was being a \\[bitch\\] because I was petty and resented A for trying to figure herself out when she was young. They told me that I should be considerate and do a good deed for her. Did I mention they wanted me to do it for free?\n\nI told them that there was no way I would be able to do that and left the GC.
