But they stayed close friends til the day my mother died. My dad remarried Ana when I was 7, she had a daughter Eve (22f). Then they had our brother Jake (16M) together.\r  \n\r  \nJake was really sick when he was a toddler so our parents spent a lot of time at the hospital with him and I spent a lot of time at my moms house. Eve\u2019s dad worked weird hours so my mom was more than happy to take Eve too most of the time. She loved hanging out with kids.\r  \n\r  \nMy mom was a talented and passionate artist and she was determined to foster a love of art in us. And she did for both of us but Eve is far more talented than I am and her & my mom bonded over their shared love of painting.\r  \n\r  \nMy mother passed away suddenly this January. I was always extremely close with her and I was & still am completely devastated. I still can\u2019t accept that she\u2019s gone forever... I miss her so so much. In late April, I finally got up the spirit to start organizing her things.\r  \n\r  \nEve approached me after I mentioned that I was going to my mothers home to sort through some stuff and she asked me if she could look through my moms paintings and have a few as a keepsakes because my mother was such an inspiration for her.\r  \n\r  \nI don\u2019t want to & I refused. Not the paintings. I\u2019m willing to give her clothes, jewelry, furniture, almost anything but the paintings and journals are closest things I have left to my mom. There\u2019s pieces of her soul in there, it\u2019s not just stuff. They\u2019re the most personal items she left and I don't want to let a single one go.\r  \n\r  \nEve got really upset and said she didn\u2019t care about any of the other things either and she didn\u2019t think she was asking for that much. She said my mother was an important person in her life and that they had a strong relationship. Eve believes that if my mother would\u2019ve left her something if she had the opportunity to decide.\r  \n\r  \nI still said no and Eve went to her mom to complain and now my immediate family is torn on the issue and arguing when we see each other. My dad understands but thinks I can give up one or two. And that I might change my mind in a couple years once the pain isn\u2019t so fresh and I do think that could\u2019ve happened before but Eve and Ana are pushing me so hard on it and being passive aggressive towards me and I feel completely different about them now. We all used to be close.\r  \n\r  \nI understand she wasn\u2019t a stranger to my mom but that\u2019s just not enough to me. I think my own grief is bigger and to ask me for such a personal thing so soon after her death was insensitive. And I\u2019m ever more upset that they don\u2019t even see the irony of Eve sending her own living mother after me for my dead moms stuff. My boyfriend wants me to just give her one and repair my family so I stop tormenting myself but I think I want to stand my ground here so AITA?", "created_utc": 1684539758, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13mbogh/aita_for_refusing_to_share_a_single_piece_of_my/", "score": 5639, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Objectively she should also be grieving in her way? \n\nThen again, she is wrong to send her mum against you, especially when you lost yours.  \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a bad suggestion, but tell Eve that you are not ready to part with anything currently and she needs to give you space to grief instead of turning your family against you. \n\nHaving to cope with the passing of a parent is hard enough without all these family pressures.\n\nVirtual hugs to you.", "NAH\n\nI don't think this is about the paintings as much as this is about your grieving.

I don't want to call you an AH because what you're going through is horrible, and grief can cause a lot of emotions. But you say that they shared a bond, especially through the paintings. I understand that the trauma from your loss is making it hard to part with them. Depending on how many there were that she left, I'd seriously urge you to consider parting with one, even if it is just one. Eve is also grieving, not the same your grief, but grief nonetheless. \n\n>her & my mom bonded over their shared love of painting\n\n>She said my mother was an important person in her life and that they had a strong relationship.\n\nThey bonded over some of those paintings. She was *your* mother, but other people still had close relationships with her and want to cherish memories with her too. \n\n I lost someone who was close to me a few years ago. when I discovered that I wasn't able to hold onto any of the things we made memories with because direct family members refused to part with them, it hurt. A lot. I understood it, and let it go, because grief is a huge, painful thing. But others are feeling it too.\n\n\nEdit: I am not condoning Eve's actions. The way Eve is handling being denied is not right. However, she is also dealing with grief, which can make tensions high and emotions run rampant. I hope that they can overcome this and learn healthier coping methods. \n\nOP should *not* feel pressured or bullied into making a certain decision if they do not feel *fully comfortable* with it.

Would you be as insistent that Eve get nothing if, instead of being your stepsister, she was a close friend of your mom\u2019s?\n\nI don\u2019t think I have enough information to judge you, but I think you need to do some deeper introspection into the reasons why you aren\u2019t giving Eve any of the art.", "I don't think anyone is an asshole here. I understand why you wouldn't want to give up your mother's artwork, but I also think you could benefit from seeing it more from Eve's perspective. She was (I assume 4? based on the post but could be wrong) when your mother also became a part of her life. Your mom took care of her from such a young age and was essentially a second mother to her. She inspired her and nurtured her talents for the arts, and she really sounded like a very important figure in her life. Obviously, I get that losing your mom has caused tremendous grief and you may not be willing to let go any part of her (including her art), but I also get it from Eve's perspective and understand if having a piece of your mom's work would help her grief. Nobody is an asshole here, and I would recommend to just try discussing it with each other when you're feeling less devastated about the loss of your mother.", "NAH -- grief is messy... this situation is going to be messy. i dont think there's a right or wrong. i understand both viewpoints. i agree with your father, things may change when the wound is less fresh. but maybe it doesn't. is there a way you could compromise with eve and scan the paintings to her somehow? or high quality photos? i feel like that would be a nice olive branch that could go a long way.", "NTA - it\u2019s your mom\u2019s stuff and everything is still so fresh.

My husband's mentor's siblings and other relatives, although blood related, did not suffer health effects after his passing, yet they could have easily thought their grief was \"bigger\" because of the relation.

Would they appreciate it if their mum/dad/partner/child had died and you ganging up on them for a painting/piece of jewellery etc.\n\nI would also probably hit a bit low and tell Eve that she cannot imagine what you are feeling or going through as she still has her mum.  And that you would give away all the paintings if it meant you could have more time with yours.\n\nTell them that their timing was absolutely inappropriate and at some point in the future you probably would have gifted a painting or 2 to Eve but it\u2018s evident that she cares more about materialistic items then she does her family mental health and feelings.  Also tell you dad and your boyfriend to either back you up or back off!!", "NTA - your grief is too new. Too big. The more they try to push you, the more you\u2019re gonna push back. And then nobody is going to be happy. Just tell them to leave you alone for now. You need some time to process and you are not available to make any decisions like that right this second. And if they had any respect for your mom, they should/will respect you. If not, they don\u2019t deserve anything. You may change your mind and gift something down the road.

I don\u2019t think anyone would blame you for feeling so distraught and wanting to hang on to the things that remind you of your mother. \n\nBut Eve had a relationship with her too, and she\u2019s family. That might not have been her mother, but that was her creative mentor. Someone she aspired to and pursued her craft because of. And all she\u2019s asking is for one or two paintings that can be there to remind her of her mentors passion for the craft. Plus, if you keep in good with Eve, you\u2019ll be a part of each others life forever. You\u2019ll never truly lose the art, you\u2019ll just have another location (Eve\u2019s house) where you are reminded of your mothers positive influence and legacy. How is that a bad thing? \n\nObviously no one can force you to give over the art, it\u2019s yours to do with as you see fit, but I think it would mean a hell of a lot to Eve for you to share.", "YTA\n\nI am sorry for your loss and am assuming your behavior is due to grief.  Eve isn't some random step-sibling who didn't even know your mother, your mother and her shared something, she was an important person to her, as you said they had a bond. \n\nTo not allow Eve to have a single one when it sounds like there is quite a bit is selfish. She lost her as well and clearly wants to have something to remind her of your mom. \n\nYou are both grieving, and neither of you acting your best.

Stand your ground!", "Esh.\n\nObviously, Eve and her mother are in the wrong for pushing it and ganging up on you like that.\n\nHowever, I do think your pain is clouding your judgment. It sounds like your mother left behind a lot of paintings behind and that she was like a second mother to your sister during a period in her life that her parents were prioritizing another child. I think you should have tried to compromise and picked out a painting to give her. Or gently told her that the loss is still too fresh and you're not ready to part with them but would revist it the future. Instead, it sounds like you're making a competition out of grief and dismissing your sisters connection to your mother.\nObviously, you're the most impacted by your mother's loss, but people are going to mourn her too and want to hold on to her memory as well.\n\nNow that Eve and her mother have pushed, I get that you're probably even less willing to give Eve a painting. However, if you think there's any possibility of you regreting it in the future, I suggest that you reach out to Eve. Calmly tell her that you are hurt by how she approached things while you are mourning your mother. Acknowledge that you understand that she's also mourning, but she should be able to understand that you are still in a very emotional space after losing your mother and you're simply not ready to lose certain belongings of hers.

Either way, now isn\u2019t the time to make huge decisions like this. \n\nThe idea others shared about making prints might go over well with Eve, and either way, you\u2019re allowed to grieve in your own time. \n\nI am very sorry for your loss and for the added difficulty of the drama your stepfamily is adding to it.", "NTA. Because they keep pressing the ask, and ignoring your grief.", "Soft YTA because you are grieving but Eve had a shared relationship with your mom and art and spent a ton of time with her as well. Bonds are way more than blood and if they spent as much time together as you say and she fostered the love of art in her, it would only be right.\n\nHow many are there? For her to have one or two makes complete sense.", "~~YTA.~~ Changing to ESH because yeah, Eve is shitty for harassing you and especially for getting her mom involved.\n\nI feel for you, I really do. I hoard stuff from my family like a dragon. But your mom loved Eve, and Eve returned the favor. Not only that, but your mother's passion and talent for art lives on in Eve-- Eve's love and practice of art are some of the pieces of soul your mom left behind.\n\nEve knew your mom most of her life, and it sounds like your mother had an immeasurable impact on her. She also clearly saw herself as part of your family. Your behavior is telling her that she never was. As bad as you feel about her and Ana right now, Eve is feeling the same about you. \n\nI also want to encourage you to think about something-- if your mom could see you now, refusing to share the thing that bonded the three of you together, do you think she would be happy? She doesn't sound like the kind of woman who would be glad that you're keeping them for yourself, or proud of you for standing your ground here.

It's not going to hurt you to let your sister have a one or two of the paintings.  She is grieving too.", "I hate to call you the AH since your loss is tragic. I understand how you feel. I also understand Eve\u2019s perspective. I personally think that Eve is deserving of a piece of your mom too, since they were so close and really bonded over art. Would you consider loaning one to Eve? Maybe like a museum where you sign a contract with her, and then in six months or a year or two she could switch the pieces out for a different one? That way they are technically yours but she can feel close to your mom? And you can always revisit it/change your mind about permanently gifting her one, or even once the first loan term is up deciding that right now it\u2019s too hard and not continuing doing it?", "YTA. Your mom shared this passion with both of you and cared for her. From the way you portray your mom, your mom would probably want to share her art with Eve. Some of it should be shared since your mother fostered it in you two and Eve will be inspired as an artist just like your mom wanted it.", "I'm sorry for your loss. Losing a parent is devastating, especially when it's sudden and unexpected. Grief affects us all differently, and the sharing of heirlooms and memories is often fraught even in straightforward situations.\n\nYTA for refusing to share a single piece of your mother's art, but you're also deep in grief (and so is Eve) and grief makes us As at times. A lot of becoming an adult is learning that other people cannot see our internal state of we hide it, and that we cannot see other people's internal state if they hide it. Clearly Eve HAS waited for you to be ready to face dealing with your mother's belongings. She probably felt that this was a positive development that you might be ready to discuss how your mother's art - precious to both of you - might be split. Clearly you're not there yet, but she's not evil for this misunderstanding.\n\nTry to forgive Eve and your family for this. Understand that everyone grieves differently. Everyone's grief over the loss of your mother is real and true and deep and affecting their decision making. If you have the capacity, tell Eve that you're not ready to talk about splitting you mom's art yet but that you will be ready in a month or so. That you appreciate that your mom was a mom too her too for 15 years and that her art was precious to both of you. But for now you need a little bit more space to grieve.", "I am sorry for your loss.

Would your mom have wanted Eve to have some of the paintings had she sorted through the paintings and called them out in a will before she died? Would she have hoped that you would share her talent and memories with Eve given her passing? While your grief is understandable, this should be about what your mom would\u2019ve wanted.", "YTA. You are being selfish. It would not hurt you to let Eve have one painting of someone who meant a lot to her too. Your reaction is pretty extreme in my opinion, especially the bitterness over Eve interacting with her mom (like a normal person) and her mom (like a normal person) speaking to you. You need therapy to deal with your emotions. It\u2019s more than grief.

True, if Eve and Ava had been a little less self-centered, you may have come around to parting with a painting or two.  Of course, your mother could have given Eve a piece herself if she'd wanted to.  You DID offer Eve a different option (several of them, in fact) as a memento, which she very ungraciously refused.  As it stands, I'd make it very clear to them that the more they harangue you about parting with YOUR MOTHER'S things, the more resolved you are that you made the correct choice.  Also, make it very clear to them that their continued harassment of you during an incredibly difficult time won't be tolerated.  I'd recommend going LC with the two of them for the immediate future and I'd be very clear to your dad that if he presses the issue, you'll follow suit for him.

Look to see if there are two that give you similar feelings when you look at them. Maybe they share a color story or subject matter.

Go to your moms & do what it was you intended to do. Pack your moms art carefully & store them away for a few months. Then you grieve. Wake up the next day & breath in & out. Then grieve some more. Or don\u2019t. There is no textbook way to grieve. It comes & goes.  \n\nNow, here is a suggestion to help give you time to decide whether you want to keep your moms art wrapped & stored away or to showcase then in your home.  And to assist Eve, who wasn\u2019t related to your mom but did have a relationship with her, with her grief.   Write Eve a letter. Tell her you are sorry for dismissing her & her feelings toward your mother. Ask her to understand that right now, you can\u2019t think straight & are emotionally compromised. You need time. Lots of time. And at the end of that time, maybe 6 months? Maybe a year. Or two. There is no expiration date for grief & no rush to be okay. And that you will consider her request & ask that she respect your wishes & give you space to handle all these emotions. And also, getting other family members involved was a terrible thing to do & that you feel very attacked. This was YOUR mother. you feel overwhelmed & lost. It wasn\u2019t fair of her to get others involved to emotionally bully you & that if it continues then you will not be able to ever feel objective nor happy to possibly give her any of your mothers art. As of right now, you feel angry & disgusted with the entire situation. But if she gives you the space & time, you hope that the two of you will be able to one day come together & talk about how much your mom meant to the both of you.", "NAH\n\nBut I would hope despite your grief you can acknowledge your step sis and mom had a deep, unique bond too. \n\nMy mother is a wonderful painter and I paint similarly to her. My sis is more talented at sewing and knitting, something me and my mom don't do well, but BOTH us daughters each have a few of mom's paintings. \n\nYou're not obligated to share any paintings, you are not the bad guy for refusing, but it would be an incredibly generous thing to do.", "NAH", "Nah. But I\u2019d ask yourself what you honestly think your mother would have wanted and would go from there.", "NTA. Like you mentioned, you may have felt differently in the future, but the way Eve and Anna are behaving right now is selfish and entitled. You have the right to grieve however you need to. Do not let them make you feel bad or bully you into submission.", "NTA.  I would shoot straight with Eve.  She has no idea of the grief you\u2019re feeling.  She may have lost someone she admired and was even a little close to, but you lost your mother - and she still has hers.  Bluntly tell her she cannot understand your pain and right now is not a good time to ask you to give up any part of your mom you have left.\n\nBut now you have drama in the family because of this.  Tell Eve that you hear and understand why she is making this request.  While right now, your grief is too fresh to part with any paintings, you will consider it again down the road, BUT only if she and the rest of your family back off.  If at a later time, you feel differently, you will let her know.  But if she cannot drop it at a time you are experiencing some of the worst pain on your life, then she will lose the opportunity permanently.\n\nEve and the rest of your family should have enough sense and love not to push you on this, but if bargaining that you\u2019ll reconsider down the road buys you some time and space from the drama, it may be worth it.", "It's too soon.

I have witnessed my parents and their siblings squabble and hold long term resentments with each other when divvying up their parents' things after they died. It's silly. Your mom sounds like she was a very loving person, who was happy to share her kindness with someone who was not her own. What makes you more deserving of the relics of that love than your step sibling? And what, exactly, will you lose by letting your sister have a painting of your mom's? \n\nI know your grieving and like others said, I would ask for some time. But I do think that you receive what you put out, if you catch my drift. If you put out love, kindness, generosity just like your mother did, then you will get it in return.

But one shirt would mean the world to me. He went thru the closet and separated 4 out of the group and I chose one of those. Win win. \n\nYour grief is real and I\u2019m sorry.

I really think when the shock and numbness wear off, you will come to regret the way you are alienating your family.

I love that I still grieve my mother, but I hate it too. People react to such a huge loss differently.  You may find yourself thawing in a while, but it's too raw right now.  And giving up any part of her feels impossible because that's all that's left of her. \n\nMy mom was the foundation of my world, and I still don't know how to navigate this life without her.  You're angry she's gone,  or at least I was,  so I'm assuming. And when someone wants a part of the lost person, it's impossible to think of giving it up.  \n\nMaybe you'll be ready to share the pieces of her someday, but not yet. And that's ok,  even if it's not in your lifetime,  that's ok too. You can,  if you feel ready, tell this girl who loved your mom,  that when you're gone you'll leave them to her in your will,  or to give you time to come to terms with how you feel and you'll be able to reassess, or that you utterly understand why she wants to have something of your moms mind but you can't do it.  She can have pictures of them. If you never can do it,  that's ok.  If you find yourself able to let go later,  that's ok too. Maybe you'll want to have a bondfire, and burn it all, that is ok. \n\nIt's hard to tell people to leave you alone and let you be when you're hurting,  I couldn't.  I was lucky enough to have a lot of people to help me. I still smart (two years later) over a well-meaning friend who threw away my mom's lotion, because that's what she smelled like.  It's not great lotion, I didn't love it before she died,  but I would swim in it now.  If you are worried about your family and the relationship with them,  and you might not have that in you right now,  but if you do. Tell her that you're not ready to let go,  that if you are you'll tell her. And to let it be until then.  She's hurting too and probably angry over the loss of a strong important woman in her life. \n\nYour mom sounds incredible! I'm sure she impacted many of the people around her,  but she was yours too. And the paintings she poured her soul into are the parts of it that are tangible in this world.  They will exist long after we're all dust,  part of her will live forever in them.  I look at Van Gogh's art, or Dali's, or Stan Lee, or watch an old Cary Grant movie, or read Tolkien, and part of them lives.  Art transcends our lives. And I love that.  My mom made jewelry,   I wear a necklace she made me and never take it off. The tangible part of her that I can,  I hold tight.  I had to sell the home she lived in most of our lives last year,  and it about killed me.  She died at home with me holding her hand,  IN that house.  I kissed her for the last time in that house.  And I ache thinking about it.  \n\nNAH", "NTA, regardless of her relationship to your mom, you were her child. you aren\u2019t harboring ill will towards Eve , but you set a boundary about what you\u2019re willing to give to her & she turned it around on you . she may be grieving but she still has her mom & memories to make as well. you shouldn\u2019t give her any paintings if you dont want to. you offered her anything else but those & that should\u2019ve been enough for her. im sorry for your loss and i know your mother would be content with her daughter having the most intimate parts of her life, passion, & soul. you dont have to give that to anyone. heal & dont let anyone guilt trip you while you\u2019re already down.", "YTA. \nThe paintings are yours to do with as you wish, but you\u2019re being cruel in what you\u2019re doing.\n\nYour mom was important to her as well, it\u2019s not a matter of who is experiencing greater loss.

The emotionally mature answer would've been \"I'm not ready right now, but let's revisit the topic in a few months or a year\"\n\nI'm sorry for what you're going through, but I can't imagine being so callous as to disregard your stepsister's love and appreciation of the place your mother held in her life.", "YTA, it's one painting. Are you going to hang all of them at your house, or leave a bunch in storage? \n\nIt's hard to make good decisions when you're grieving. Let Evie know you need some time and then you'll give her one.", "I kinda wanna go NAH\u2026 they\u2019re grieving, and it\u2019s understandable that they\u2019d be acting out of character because this is a situation of high emotions. But you have every right to refuse.", "NAH. I think sometimes grief has to be selfish for a person to fully process it. You're not wrong for wanting to hold on to everything you can from your mom. I don't think Eve is wrong either because it sounds like your mom was important to her and the art specifically is what solidified their bond. In time I think you'll both be able to find ways to compromise and grieve in a way that supports each other.", "YTA, but I know you\u2019re grief is clouding your decisions. If she left multiple paintings, giving one to Eve would have been a lovely gesture and you still have her other paintings. It sounds a bit like you\u2019re jealous of their shared talent and bond. I was very close to my father and was devastated when he died, but shared his things with others, taking solace in knowing he will be remembered by many of his friends who cherish those items. I know he would have considered me selfish if I had hoarded things that were special to others.", "YTA.   \nYour mother was a close member of Eve\u2019s life too\u2026 she looked after Eve from a young age, mentored and fostered her love of art, and had a 15 year relationship by the sounds of it with her.   \nYour mum\u2018s relationship wasn\u2019t \u2018step dad\u2019s ex wife\u2019, but a genuine relationship with mutual respect with Eve, and  while you lost your mum, Eve lost a lot too.   \n\n\nChoose what you want to keep for yourself, and then let Eve choose from the rest. You won\u2019t want everything. You are putting your own (very valid) grief ahead of the future relationship with Eve, and that\u2019s going to cause you a life time of grief.", "NAH but maybe it\u2019s better than you\u2019re not the only one trying to honor her memory?

If moms had say 10 paintings and Eve wanted 3-4 NTA. \n\nEve also a bit of an ass for pushing back, if she would've been chill trust me in time the OP would want to give her a few paintings. \n\nTiem will resolve this issue, trust me.", "I dont think you're an asshole.\n\nWhat would your mom want?\n\nYou already know the answer.\n\nGrieve and share pieces of your mom's soul with those  who would appreciate it.", "If you are going to display or protect the art and you feel this way keep it.  But if it is going to just sit or be stored then YWBTA.", "NTA\n\nYou're grieving and need time to sort through your emotions. Eve is grieving too and it wasn't out of line for her to ask. When she kept pushing it and brought her mom into it, well, that's a different story.\n\nI do suspect (as you did) that in time, your attitude might have changed. Can you ask your family to give you some time without pressuring you and then set a time to revisit it in a year or two?\n\nThis is probably one of the first times you or Eve have suffered such a big loss - you're both pretty young and the feelings can be very overwhelming. Time will change how you feel - not erase it, but temper it.", "NAH. \n\n\nI do think maybe you should revisit this after the pain isn't so raw. You're both grieving.", "NAH.. I feel like this is tricky. My mom died suddenly in her sleep when I was 26. She was an avid crocheter and left a stash of finished blankets. My sisters and I agreed that we would gift them to close friends and family members when they had children so that these other people who loved our mom could have a piece of her. This makes sense in our situation because that's why she made the blankets in the first place. I don't know if this is helpful or not. Everyone grieves in their own way, but for me it feels good to share this special part of my mom with people who can appreciate it.", "NAH\n\nYour step-sister is going through a grief that sounds very similar to yours, only it's being deemed as less valid because it's not her bio mom. Wouldn't you be sad and want a meaningful keepsake of Ana if she passed? Wouldn't you be hurt if Eve categorically refused? \n\nI would suggest just being honest about how you feel. \"Eve, I'm still hurting and processing. I was only just going to look and take inventory, not even remotely ready to start actually making decisions about the stuff there. So you asking for something so soon felt overwhelming and really upsetting. I'm not opposed to you having something, I'm just not ready for that yet. But the way you and Ana have treated me since then has been deeply hurtful and is making me feel really alienated.\" \n\nLet her sit with that and see what she says. Because while I agree it's 100% your right to decide what gets done with your Moms things, it seems a bit cruel to say no to someone your Mom played a huge part in raising. That doesn't seem like something that (from the very little that's here) she would have wanted. I'm sure your step-sister is feeling very rejected by your refusal and alienated in her own way. You may find a common path forward here.", "First of all I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\nThis is a tough one because to be completely honest I think you should\u2019ve given her one, but now her reaction has ruined the good faith. As someone else already pointed out, gifts should be given because the giver wants to, not because the receiver pressured them about it. \n\nMy first reaction was E S H, but now I\u2019m thinking NAH. Both of you have done things I don\u2019t necessarily agree with, but you\u2019re both also somewhat excused due to the circumstances imo. \n\nINFO: how much art are we talking? I could be swayed from NAH to either NTA or YTA based on whether it was a lot or a little.", "NAH. Both of you are grieving in your own ways and both, as you have stated, had a close relationship with your mother, where she was a very close friend if not basically a second mother to Eve. \n\nWhen you have some time to reflect, skipping anyone else's comments from family, reconsider gifting Eve one painting of your mother's. It sounds like you and Eve have a decent relationship and this one thing can either cement it or ruin it.", "P", "So, you have a step sister who you are apparently close to, close enough to call her your immediate family, and that your mother was very close to, close enough to foster an artistic interest that they shared passion in.

Sorry to go against the grain but I\u2019m saying YTA, regardless of the family drama that followed.", "I\u2019m going with ESH. Your grieve is valid but so is your sisters.\n\nEdit: regardless of how she\u2019s related she was extremely close to your mother and deserves a piece of her art too.", "YTA", "YWBTA - I\u2019ve recently started going through my deceased mothers things. I was a primary caretaker for the month and a half after she fell in the shower one night and the next day was diagnosed with stage IV glioblastoma. Half of her body was paralyzed. \n\nI get why you\u2019re having all of these emotions. I get why she wants a painting or two. That is also something she shared a love for with your mom, who introduced her to that form of art. \n\nI\u2019ve been in charge of handling my moms stuff and it\u2019s been hard giving people things that I wanted or had an attachment to, but I know mom would want that person to have those things or a specific item. \n\nIt\u2019s been a hell of a process already and a lot of family drama. I\u2019ve gone NC with one of my sisters and her husband due to an item. I was treated like dog shit over doing research (yes, I only asked a single family member if they knew where it came from) on a newspaper that was found in her storage unit. \n\nMy words were misconstrued and their made up drama was told to other family members. They swore up and down I was trying to keep it. After my older sister, whom we agreed to give it to, gave it to me for my husband who is a history major. My older sister and my stepdad were there and saw everything that transpired. It\u2019s crazy how people can act when it comes to situations like this. I never said I was keeping it after they told me they thought it came from her husbands great grandmother. I even offered it to them! It was all fucked. \n\nI know it\u2019s YOUR moms stuff. You can\u2019t tell me your mom wouldn\u2019t want her to have a piece of her soul. There\u2019s just no way from how you described their relationship. If you don\u2019t give her a couple of paintings, you will regret it in a few years. Your heart will hurt for her and then it may be too late. You pick the paintings you MUST have and can\u2019t live without. Let her choose from a handful remaining. I know, I swear I know how hard it is. Just please keep in mind how you would feel if you were her. Switch places in your head and you\u2019ll realize she\u2019s hurting like you.", "Stand your ground tell eve and her mom it was a b move to ask especially so soon and a bigger b move for eve to send her mom to harass you for your dead moms things and you considered that when the pain wasn't so fresh giving 1 or 2 to eve but since they seem to think they are entitled and harassed you you have decided to never give her anything perhaps if they shut up about and SINCERELY apologize you might reconsider in the future", "Sorry for your loss. Gotta be real tough on you and everyone else. That said, it\u2019s also hard on Eve. Seems like your mom thought of her as a daughter too.

It\u2019s been about 4 months since she dead - I get Eve and your mum were close but she was not her mum. I get that she gave it a bit of time to ask, but she should have accepted the no and considered bringing it up later when it wasn\u2019t so fresh. \n\nInstead she has let this spiral with sides and people trying to pressure you. That\u2019s not right. The paintings aren\u2019t just things of your mum\u2019s, as evidenced by your willingness to give up her possessions, the paintings are a part of her person. I\u2019m not one to make a competition of grief, but gosh darn it\u2019s right in this situation.", "NTA. This is grief. You are all grabbing at pieces of what\u2019s left of your mom out of grief.

The fact is they don't. \nSome redditors even \"urging you\" to consider XYZ are out of their lane.\nI recently lost my dad 5 weeks ago and if someone came at me like that, close relationship or no, to tantrum and involve other people after being told no to their request would be placed in time out.

A lot of people push off tasks like that, but it\u2019s best done as soon as someone has a child, and then get updated after major life events like divorce or more children. \n\nSince your mother did not expressly leave Eve anything, and these things comfort you, then do not give in to pressure to give them away. \n\nTell the family that you are the only person who lost her as your mother, and you are feeling raw and overwhelmed. Their actions are coming across as hostile and manipulative, at the worst possible time for you. Tell them to give you some grace and back off so you can deal with your feelings without a pack of relatives squabbling over wanting your mother\u2019s things.

No is a full sentence.", "NTA, but I think you should reconsider and let Eve have one painting.\n\nMy mother died suddenly this past December. She and I had a complicated relationship. Her mother, who died in 2009, was the backbone of the family. My mother was devastated by her death. She took so many things of my Grandmother's and squirreled them away. Now that my mother is gone and we're cleaning out her things, it's heartbreaking to see all of the things that have been hidden away in an attic for 14 years when there are family members that would have treasured them. \n\nGrief isn't a competition. Eve could have been more sensitive to your feelings, but she is grieving too. She is entitled to grieve in her way just as you are to grieve in yours.

I'm 37 now.\n\nIt still hurts, but it's not quite as raw.\n\nI eventually did want to share some of their precious items with people who loved them, but some of my brothers paintings are just way too precious for me to ever give away. I'll never get another conversation with him, but sometimes when I see his art around my home it makes me feel that there is a piece of him still with me.\n\nIf someone asked me what he would have wanted...? He didn't want to die. He wanted to live. He was desperate to live and refused to even discuss death. I had to be the one to help him write a will and end of life plans so that we could get him hospice care. It broke my heart.\n\nNobody else was with me in that room having that talk with him. I was the one he asked to stay up to talk with him his last night with us. Nobody else stayed awake with us for hours. I was the one he shared his phone password with and asked me to read his private notes app so that I could say his prayers he had written down out loud for him when it hurt for him to talk - his most private fears. I was the one he confided in that he felt his nurses were trying to bring down his spirits when they told him to prepare for the end. \n\nSo many other people loved him and he loved them - they all have beautiful memories and pieces of him in all kinds of ways. But I was the one who had to shepherd him gently to an inevitable death he fought so hard against. It was a privilege to be trusted by him - to know that my role as his big sister could still help him navigate such scary uncharted territory.\n\nIt was so traumatic for me though. It still is. Some of the things that people said or did after that really made it worse for me and I have a hard time forgiving them. I'm working on it.\n\nHe loved to hold grudges and he would have been livid about the things they said to me in the days after his painful death I had to watch.\n\nSo basically I just don't think it matters what anyone thinks about the paintings but you.\n\nThey don't know what her death and grieving have been like for you. If you weren't there that would be traumatic too.

From what you\u2019ve said, I think it\u2019d be nice to let Eve have something eventually, but they should not be rushing/pressuring you considering the situation, and if they\u2019re gonna be assholes about it, you shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to share.", "NTA.

My dad passed last year and he was a prolific and VERY talented artist, his work sells for five figures.  My house is filled with his art and so is my parents' place.  When he passed, I initially felt a need to horde all of his paintings as they are the closest thing to my heart, but I've since realized that's the wrong approach. My dad had a wife, sisters, brother, all grieving and altho it's easy for me to say my grieving is more important than all of them other than my mom and brother, it's not. I have found great joy in giving his nieces and nephews his easels, paints, brushes, cameras, so many things they were crying when I did so because they felt like my dad was an inspiration for them to keep doing art.\n\nYou can't take them with you when you leave this world and it's more important for me to ensure that family members that want a painting get a painting.  There are a few family members that don't have one yet and I plan to pass them on other than the ones we don't sell. Don't get me wrong, I want to keep them all, I love them all, but why?  You should really reconsider giving 1-2 to Eve, maybe pick 1-2 that you definitely don't want her to choose and go from there.  Memories are going to be more important at the end of the day in terms of healing and you will still have plenty of art to look at.\n\nI hope you reconsider.\n\nNAH", "Christ, give her a picture.

Maybe make a deal with yourself and Eve, that you'll give yourself room to grieve and get the house sorted. And before you move in, let Eve take whatever you're comfortable with.

You're \\~a man and a father\\~, so presumably you've been 22 before and I have zero doubt that you fucked up a few times with people who were important to you at that age. If you can't empathize with a young adult who lost a significant person, I really encourage you to practice compassion with other folks before your kid(s) get to an age where they need complex emotional support from you. \n\nFWIW, I lost my dad when I was 20. My mom's response to both me and my brother was that she had known him longer so her pain was worse. \"We've known him for literally our entire lives\" fell on deaf ears. She tried to take the tiny amount of money he'd set aside for each of us because she felt entitled to it. That was shitty. What Eve asked for is shitty. My mom's reaction was shitty, Eve's reaction is shitty. But to me, someone being shitty for a limited time due to extenuating circumstances (like someone they love DYING) does not make them an asshole. Assholes don't deserve to be close to us, ever. Sad, hurt people who make mistakes out of pain aren't on the same level. There's enough evidence here that OP and Eve get along and love each other except for this one issue, and as huge and hurtful as this issue is I don't think it warrants a nuclear option of writing Eve off forever or destroying a close, loving relationship. \n\n(Ana, though........Ana fucked up good.

Not that I didn't want other people who loved him to have pieces of his art work, but as his sister it felt too personal to give that away.

But Eve isn't being DEPRIVED of anything by not getting a painting she never had and wasn't promised.  The first time OP said no they should have dropped it.

Not even close. \n\nHer manipulation alone spells out her lack of feeling. Her grief actually isn't \"big enough\" and quite possibly not even real since the focus is all about her.

The settling of affairs after a sudden death is something that comes with the territory and I think that asking you several months after the passing is a respectful thing for Eve to do. You are being blinded by not wanting to face the reality that settling an affair like this will mean she really is gone. Your mum had a bond with eve. Respect that. It\u2019s perfectly fine to ask for a breather to think it over. Communicate that to Eve. Explain how you feel about the loss of your mum.

You might say your mom was a second mom to her. You also did say they were close and art was something they both shared in interest and in talent. She is clearly at her best right now and may be a little desperate for something to hang onto just like you are. I\u2019m going to suggest that you give it some time.

What I really needed was to preserve the idea of him in my head in that moment so that he didn't rush away from me all in one go, I was devastated and had to clutch on to every little piece of him I could.

I've now come to think that there is a beauty in the things my father used or created still having a journey through the world, he lives in the ripples of love caused by someone picking up the handle of a well worn hammer, closing the oak drawer he machined perfectly or kicking an engine he put together into life and thinking \"ah, this was Bert's, he was a good bloke\".\n\nMy collection of things isn't complete anymore, but everytime I see an old friend they relate to me how the thing they have of my dad's is still there, giving them some kind of joy and that let's me smile about the old man rather than just being bitter about my loss. Its not really about the things, it's about the connection, and that will never die, it's a part of you. I've also only given things to people close enough to me that if I still see cabinets he made in people's homes whilst having a cup of tea and a catch up, I do have an understanding with them all though that if they don't need the thing they got anymore that I get it back (someone returned an old screwdriver set to me before they moved far away a couple of years ago for example).\n\nI don't think you're an AH, I think you're hurt, I think eve looks like an AH because she's hurt, I think eves mum is probably a bit of an AH, she should have known better.

I know you're hurting too but I really need support right now, i feel really alone, I can't handle falling out with the people close to me on top of that\" if they're still petty after that then you have your answer, die on the hill, you've been completely the bigger person.", "Okay, this settles it.

I guess both parties need to talk and decide if the art is worth the relationship.", "The request to go through the paintings and pick out the ones she wants \u2014 that\u2019s very presumptuous, and also seems to convey that Eve thinks of herself as the heir to OP\u2019s mother\u2019s artistry. Like because they had bonded over art, OP couldn\u2019t really understand her mother\u2019s art the way her stepsister could.", "And! OP offered other things like jewelry. Other things that eve can have as a memory of her loss. That was very generous. Eve feels entitled to a painting- or two! Or five!- and isn\u2019t taking no for an answer. Fuck all the way off, eve.", "Someone who was like a parent is someone who was a close adult who does not fulfill the actual parental role or fill the emotional role of a parent. I am not talking about chosen parents. You can have the same parental bond with someone that is not actually your parent, and if that was the case with Eve, maybe it would be different. Eve, however, clearly feels that bond with her own, living, mother.", "That's why I suggested the parents work it out and approach their own kids to get a feel for how they are thinking and help each other come to an understanding.\n\nI agree that whatever OP wants is her decision alone.  I was saying in a *perfect* world - one before Eve and her mother pushed the OP - this would have been better handled through the parents trying to comfort and assure their kids separately. That includes perhaps having the girls agree to delay this conversation until a later time when they have both had time to process some of their emotions better.", "[removed]", "No, she asked for *a few* of her paintings. \n\nI agree with her father, give it some time, the daughter may find a couple she would be willing to part with.

And keep her journals no matter what.", ">\"Eve approached me after I mentioned that I was going to my mothers home to sort through some stuff and she asked me if she could look through my moms paintings and have a few as a keepsakes because my mother was such an inspiration for her.\"\n\nNot a U-Haul but I think it was overstepping when Eve asked to come look through OP's mom's paintings and choose *a few* for herself. It's understandable if that felt intrusive and demanding to OP, fresh in her grief.\n\nThat's worse than just asking OP if she's comfortable letting her have a painting. And what's even worse is not letting it go when this is so raw and OP said no.\n\nPeople often clutch onto their loved one's things for comfort when they first die. If OP ever decides to give Eve a painting it needs to be on her timeline with no pressure from anyone. And if she doesn't want to, that's her choice. No one has to like it but they should respect her decision.", "Yes, but when she was told no by her mentor's grieving child, she went and sic'd her own mother and the rest of the family on her stepsibling to DEMAND her stepsibling give up the goods. Op's mom would be appalled at her mentored child's behavior, even if she would've been okay willing a painting to her. Stepsister is literally tearing their family a part and adding additional stress because she couldn't have the decency to allow her stepsibling to grieve for a while. \n\nA close friend would've stepped back, and realized what additional grief and damage they were causing. Both stepsister and stepmother should be ashamed of themselves.", "Actually, Op said she asked to go through Op\u2019s mom\u2019s things and have a few paintings.", "Stepsis didnt ask for A painting, she asked for a FEW, that she\u2019s expecting to pick out herself no less. I mean how entitled and then sicking her family on her\u2026 classic vulture behaviour, you dont treat people you care about like that", "Agreed. But I also think in the face of an unexpected tragedy they both should get a pass for being... uncharitable. \n\nOP for saying Eve doesn't deserve any piece of OP's mother, and Eve for continuing to insist she does even if she's not legally entitled to it.", "Right. We don\u2019t know that the OP\u2019s mom and Eve had a continuing relationship. People are calling her a \u201cmom figure\u201d when with the facts we have, she babysat her 10+ years ago and they bonded over a common interest and the mom sparked an interest in Eve. That sounds more like the relationship you have with a distant aunt or family friend. OP lost her MOTHER. Eve\u2019s original ask was a bit much but doesn\u2019t make her an AH but complaining to her LIVING mom sure does. \n\nOPs grief is still and she even says she might have felt differently in time. My dad has been dead for 20 years and if one of close family friends had asked for, say, some of his Yankees memorabilia right after he died I would have said no way. My mom couldn\u2019t donate any of my dads things for a year. With time we both felt differently but you need to give people time.

Do you think anyone would dare to demand the children of their nanny to give them deeply personal items as mementos?\n\nGrief or not, there is a time and a place. And lashing out at first could make sense, but they keep at it and it seems no one is inclined to tell her to stop. While they are very happy to tell OP, the actual daughter to give away her mom's paintings.\n\nFor me Eve is a huge ah. If she loved OPs mom she would realize that OPs mom would never want to see OP suffering and being harassed by the family.\n\nShe doesn't even really care, she wants the paintings. OP had offered other stuff. So is this about a memento to remember her or is this about having the paintings she wants? Yes you can say paintings are special, but in the current situation if she really wanted a memento, any would do. I mean even the brushes. But instead she asked to go and check to pick the paintings she wanted. I could bet that ir OP had agreed and she would have chosen a painting OP didn't want to part with, they would be at the same place.\n\nStep sister didn't even ask for any painting, she asked to go and select a few, the entitlement of such a request is ridiculous.\n\nNTA. I bet The reason everyone tells OP to give in, is because she is usually the reasonable one while step sister is used to get away with what she wants. Because her mom and all her family in this argument was also a very low move.", "eve is also grieving. you won't give her a pass? How reliable of a narrator is someone who is grieving their mother when the subject is so sensitive and there are so many blurred lines (ie. the  bond between her stepsister and her mother).", "I'm indigenous Mexican, from the Mixtec people and we are quite the opposite on death so it's fascinating seeing and reading how different others are. \n\nWhat tribe are you?

Like did OP just casually tell stepsis that she's going to her moms place and stepsis thinks OPs already been through the stuff so it should be fine for her to go through it too. Or has OP been emotionally leaning on stepsis and stepsis thinks she has a right to this stuff.\n\nStepsis kinda sounds like she thinks she's entitled to everything OP is. Like \"she was like a mom to me and you're my sister so we're in the same position for Inheritance\".", "Actually she wanted to pick the paintings. For me this is just ridiculous. She wants to go and get the mementos she wants out of OPs mom belongings.\n\nStep sister went very wrong about this and then upped the bet pulling everyone in the family. And everyone is telling OP to give in, not because it is the right thing but to keep the peace. Whenever everyone gangs up on the person that is saying \"no I don't want to give my stuff away\" over the person that is actually causing all the drama, the step sister, you know they just don't want to deal with step sister. They think OP is more reasonable and will give in. No one cares that OP lost her mother and should be allowed to grief as she needs to. \n\nThe step sister was waiting for OP to go do that to get paintings she wanted. What do you think was going to happen if OP said OK but then step sister wanted a painting she didn't want to part with? Wanna bet step sister would have pulled the same nonsense and people would be telling her to just give in? People don't like to rock the boat, when someone does it, when someone stands their ground everyone tries to stop it. If the family is willing to harass OP, when she is grieving the loss of her mother, they were not good family to begin with. If the sister soo much wanted a memento, she should be able to conform with anything else, at least for the moment. But no, she wants the paintings. Step sister should have waited, should have shown empathy, she could have even said hey I would like a painting of your mom to remember her, but please take your time consider, or whatever.\n\nNTA. Does it suck that someone close to you dies and you can't get a memento? Yes it sucks, but the family, the daughter in this case, takes priority. You can ask politely, and probably OP would have felt inclined to give away a painting after a while. But demanding to be allowed to check the stuff so you can get what you want and when you are told no, turn everyone around on the grieving daughter. I can tell you OPs mom wouldn't want to give any painting to such a person.", "Mom helped raise Eve, too.

Honoring the mom is nice in theory, but it will just be a guess because no directives were left behind. Imagine if the mom actually did want OP to have everything/decide what she wanted? That's just as likely a possibility.", "OP needs to pull themselves out of their grief and think about what their mother would want them to do. She was close to the half sister and she welcomed her into her home and her heart, so I know she would want OP to share her artwork. \n\nI get grief. I get wanting to hold onto things that belong to the person that we lost, but those things are just things. The memories that OP, their mom and half sister share can\u2019t be taken away. \n\nThe whole situation is sad and OP is letting their grief control them and it\u2019s destroying their family.", "I agree with this, particularly because sharing OP\u2019s mom\u2019s work would be like spreading her positive energy to someone else she deeply cared about. Obviously not the same as she cared for her own daughter, but the gesture to share the love she so clearly gave when she was alive, would probably have meant a lot to her", "I don't understand this. Why is Eve entitled to anything? She asked and OP said no, that should be the end of it. She may not like the answer but that's the answer she got and she's not in a position where she gets to make any decisions. OP already offered Eve literally any of the other items left behind. \n\nOP is completely right about the paintings and journals being like pieces of her mother's soul. She's not ready to part with what's left of her mother and may never be ready. That's okay. I think it's interesting that the dad understands but the two people not related to the mom do not. \n\nI have a feeling Eve doesn't understand that she's encroaching into a grief she has no grasp of. **Eve lost a mentor, not a mom.** She can go home and hug her mom when she feels torn up about OP's mom's death. OP gets to live with the torn up, hard-to-breath feeling and the reality that she doesn't have that person anymore. For the rest of her life. All the things she may have assumed she'd talk to her mom about, or show her mom, or have her mom be there for. Gone. She's adjusting to a future she didn't expect or want. Eve will have her mom on mother's day and her whole family intact for Christmas and Thanksgiving and other family holidays. Those holidays are likely going to be cruel reminders for OP for some time. In a way they will not be for Eve. \n\nAlso, as someone who loves art and particularly paintings, having art at another location does not feel as great as having art with you in your home. I bet OP feels the same: she'll be able to look at those pieces of her mother whenever she needs/wants to.", "That is just...wow. You have the ugliest, most selfish soul I've ever seen put to words. Truly remarkable, for all the worst reasons.", "Not give in to the stepmom / stepsister ganging up on me for things I already refused.", "\n\n>She decided to give them to you\n\nno, what it sounds like is she died without a will and they went to op automatically as next of kin", "If you find a reasonable option for having high quality prints made of the art, you might be able to distribute them to friends and family who are interested. It allows you to share her art while keeping the originals with you.", "Yes, because her mom probably assumed her child would have an ounce of empathy towards her sister? Maybe?", "Not making a will can be a choice, though, if the person you would want to inherit your stuff is also the person who inherits by default in your state. Many people make that decision to save money.", "I think considering what mom would've wanted is nicer in theory than in practice. Mom is dead. OP needs to do what helps her in her grief.", "Not bothering to make a will when you know your child will get everything without one can also be a choice (generally to save money).", "They are both grieving but Eve still has her mother. Her mother should be pointing that out to her and telling her to let this go instead of helping in bullying the OP to hand over some art.", "Seriously?! Yeah the loss of op IS BIGGER then the loss of stepsis, she lost her parent.

It's too soon.", "This is a really beautiful way of putting it. OP you don't have to do it right now, but if one day you were to let Eve have a painting, it will be cherished by someone who knew your mum and loved her, and will think about her and help keep her memory alive. I know that feels like your sole responsibility right now, but it doesn't have to be.\n\nI also think, ignoring the paintings issue entirely, your mum would want you to have the support network of your family around you right now (and always). She clearly had a good relationship with Eve, and it sounds like other than her art, one of the big things she gifted you both was all this time together growing up to bond as stepsisters. Those memories of making art with your mum are ones Eve can share with you. She might not be your sister by blood, but one day you might be glad of someone you can talk to about your shared memories. If you feel able, I'd suggest you try to take the advice on just turning down the temperature on things for now and asking for a bit of time.", "I am so, so sorry for your loss.", "But Eve's mother is now harassing her, and while it's totally fine for Eve to have asked, she seems to not be taking no for an answer in having her mother as well as OP's father trying to talk her into what she has already said no to.

It sounds like you've never lived in a family or spent time dealing with people. Sure, the OP can sit there alone, legally right without owing anyone anything. Or she can be with her family, morally right by doing what her mother would have obviously wanted. Make compromises, acting like an adult, and having empathy instead of alienating her family when she needs them more than ever. \n\nInstead of seeing each interaction with people as something to win or lose, why not look at as what we do for family. We do stuff for family because we love them. The OP loves her step sister. They both loved her mother.

Of course Eve is going to say that, Eve wants a painting!", "But she did have the opportunity to decide.  She may have decided not to make a will because she wanted her daughter to inherit everything anyway, and wills cost money.", "Yes it is.  Many people choose  not to make a will when the person they want to inherit is the person who will get it anyway by law.  source: am lawyer", "Or was sometime who spent a lot of time and shared interests with OP's late mother. Hardly a ghoul.", "Maybe she could\u2019ve handled it better, but it\u2019s the part where her stepmom and stepsister are pestering her for the paintings. If someone tells you \u201cno\u201d then it means \u201cno\u201d. Why are the stepsister and stepmom feel so entitled they\u2019re blowing up their family dynamic over a dead woman\u2019s paintings, who, in actuality, they had no biological relationship with that woman, and they would have no relationship with her if OP wasn\u2019t in the picture.", "I think people are getting really hung up on Eve being mentored by the mom. That in no way means mom treated or considered Eve as a daughter. It in no way means the mom would want Eve to have any of her stuff. \n\nI had an aunt that I was incredibly in awe of and she treated me well. However, I know she never considered me as close as being her child or thought of herself as a mother figure for me. When she died, the grief really hit like a truck but I know that it hit her kids even harder because their bond was different. \n\nI can't imagine how hard this must be for OP. That was her mom, of whom there is no other. Now she has only one parent (who it sounds like maybe wasn't as close to her because of other responsibilities). Eve fully has two. \n\nWhile losing a mentor is definitely heartbreaking, losing the bond between parent and child (particularly a bond that was so healthy and robust for both) is incomparable. \n\nNo one is denying that Eve is affected, but she didn't lose a parent. She has no right to any of OPs things and needs to deal with it. Her connection with OP's mom lives on in the paintings she created under her tutelage.", "I made another comment about this but thats really unlikely in my experience with trusts and estates work. It is WAY more common that people put it off thinking they had more time from what I have seen and learned. Estate planning is downright terrifying for a lot of people--it is hard to think about even if practical. So many people put it on the back burner.", "And I find it interesting that the OP is willing to give Eve things of her mother's, but not her art,  that \"by coincidence\" is the thing her mother and Eve had bonded over becuad Eve was better at it that OP. I suspect this is more about the OP being jealous of their relationship than OP's melodramatic declaration about not wanting to part with her mother's soul. And Eve's argument that the mother would have probably left a painting to her if she had the time to make a will is probably true.\n\nThat being said, she has a right to refuse and Eve and everyone pressuring her are over the line.

There's almost nothing that I hate more. One of my dad's cousin was an artist who gave paintings to just about everyone in the family. After he died, his daughter spent years \"shaking down\" relatives to to get the paintings all back. She was so rude about it that my other cousin took the painting off the wall and almost threw it at her saying you only came to visit me to get the painting so take it and go. Not even her sister has a painting. My dad is the only one who still has a painting, probably because he lives 1500 miles away from her. So something similar has happened in my family and I can empathize. \n\nTo get back on track, NTA. No one is an asshole in this situation, but imo, the OP wrong. She isn't doing what her mom would have wanted, which is to give Eve a few paintings. I know it's hard and probably feels like a loss on top of an already tragic loss, but it definitely seems like what her mom would have wanted.

I did eventually pick items out for all the cousins and for my aunts. I\u2019m still rather annoyed by the one cousin that asked.

It would allow you time to grieve, process and decide about originals, but while you are also still generously sharing some of your Mom's love and memories with Eve, who appreciated her, without you losing anything.  Plus, if you did eventually decide to give her an original, you could at least keep the copy to have the set complete.\n\nI hate to say this, but I have been on reddit too long not to.  If your Mom's home is not being lived in at the moment, consider security (changing locks, install non-permanent security system or update codes, etc.). Too many people may have ways to potentially access the home, because someone else watered plants for her one time, but still has a key or made a copy, etc.  Also, if this is unusual behavior for Eve and Ann, I would wonder if more is going on with Eve that they haven't told you about?  \n\nI also just wanted to say, I am so sorry about your Mom.", "100%", "If the art is OPs to do with as they see fit, then why does it make her an asshole for saying no?

The man who I adopted as my paternal figure barely four years ago died this week, and the grief I feel is a thousand fold what I felt for them. I have a hat he gave me, and three books he gave my husband, and we cherish them profoundly. It should be easily understandable why she wants something that makes her feel connected to OP's mother. \n\nThis is a tragedy for OP, and I feel for her deeply. It's not her job to comfort the other kid, it's really not. But pain is relative and no one can say she doesn't have the right to grieve too."]}
