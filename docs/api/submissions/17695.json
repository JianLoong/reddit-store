But they stayed close friends til the day my mother died. My dad remarried Ana when I was 7, she had a daughter Eve (22f). Then they had our brother Jake (16M) together.\r  \n\r  \nJake was really sick when he was a toddler so our parents spent a lot of time at the hospital with him and I spent a lot of time at my moms house. Eve\u2019s dad worked weird hours so my mom was more than happy to take Eve too most of the time. She loved hanging out with kids.\r  \n\r  \nMy mom was a talented and passionate artist and she was determined to foster a love of art in us. And she did for both of us but Eve is far more talented than I am and her & my mom bonded over their shared love of painting.\r  \n\r  \nMy mother passed away suddenly this January. I was always extremely close with her and I was & still am completely devastated. I still can\u2019t accept that she\u2019s gone forever... I miss her so so much. In late April, I finally got up the spirit to start organizing her things.\r  \n\r  \nEve approached me after I mentioned that I was going to my mothers home to sort through some stuff and she asked me if she could look through my moms paintings and have a few as a keepsakes because my mother was such an inspiration for her.\r  \n\r  \nI don\u2019t want to & I refused. Not the paintings. I\u2019m willing to give her clothes, jewelry, furniture, almost anything but the paintings and journals are closest things I have left to my mom. There\u2019s pieces of her soul in there, it\u2019s not just stuff. They\u2019re the most personal items she left and I don't want to let a single one go.\r  \n\r  \nEve got really upset and said she didn\u2019t care about any of the other things either and she didn\u2019t think she was asking for that much. She said my mother was an important person in her life and that they had a strong relationship. Eve believes that if my mother would\u2019ve left her something if she had the opportunity to decide.\r  \n\r  \nI still said no and Eve went to her mom to complain and now my immediate family is torn on the issue and arguing when we see each other. My dad understands but thinks I can give up one or two. And that I might change my mind in a couple years once the pain isn\u2019t so fresh and I do think that could\u2019ve happened before but Eve and Ana are pushing me so hard on it and being passive aggressive towards me and I feel completely different about them now. We all used to be close.\r  \n\r  \nI understand she wasn\u2019t a stranger to my mom but that\u2019s just not enough to me. I think my own grief is bigger and to ask me for such a personal thing so soon after her death was insensitive. And I\u2019m ever more upset that they don\u2019t even see the irony of Eve sending her own living mother after me for my dead moms stuff. My boyfriend wants me to just give her one and repair my family so I stop tormenting myself but I think I want to stand my ground here so AITA?", "created_utc": 1684539758, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13mbogh/aita_for_refusing_to_share_a_single_piece_of_my/", "score": 339, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Objectively she should also be grieving in her way? \n\nThen again, she is wrong to send her mum against you, especially when you lost yours.  \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a bad suggestion, but tell Eve that you are not ready to part with anything currently and she needs to give you space to grief instead of turning your family against you. \n\nHaving to cope with the passing of a parent is hard enough without all these family pressures.\n\nVirtual hugs to you.", "NAH\n\nI don't think this is about the paintings as much as this is about your grieving.

Depending on how many there were that she left, I'd seriously urge you to consider parting with one, even if it is just one.

Would you be as insistent that Eve get nothing if, instead of being your stepsister, she was a close friend of your mom\u2019s?\n\nI don\u2019t think I have enough information to judge you, but I think you need to do some deeper introspection into the reasons why you aren\u2019t giving Eve any of the art.", "I don't think anyone is an asshole here. I understand why you wouldn't want to give up your mother's artwork, but I also think you could benefit from seeing it more from Eve's perspective. She was (I assume 4? based on the post but could be wrong) when your mother also became a part of her life. Your mom took care of her from such a young age and was essentially a second mother to her. She inspired her and nurtured her talents for the arts, and she really sounded like a very important figure in her life. Obviously, I get that losing your mom has caused tremendous grief and you may not be willing to let go any part of her (including her art), but I also get it from Eve's perspective and understand if having a piece of your mom's work would help her grief. Nobody is an asshole here, and I would recommend to just try discussing it with each other when you're feeling less devastated about the loss of your mother.", "NAH -- grief is messy... this situation is going to be messy. i dont think there's a right or wrong. i understand both viewpoints. i agree with your father, things may change when the wound is less fresh. but maybe it doesn't. is there a way you could compromise with eve and scan the paintings to her somehow? or high quality photos? i feel like that would be a nice olive branch that could go a long way.", "NTA - it\u2019s your mom\u2019s stuff and everything is still so fresh.

She is probably used to getting her way and doesn't like that you can say no to her. Screw her and her demands. And screw anyone who takes her side. Ask them, if it was money, would they demand that you give her money just because she feels entitled to it? Well, these paintings have value just like money. They are not just worthless.", "Info: what do you think your mum have wanted? Would she have been happy for her to have one?

Maybe, you'd consider giving her a painting as a Christmas gift or on the 1 yr anniversary of your mom's death. Making a decision now is too soon.

I think you are in a lot of pain that maybe it's clouding some judgement. When you wrote that your grief is bigger, it may just be different. My husband's mentor's siblings and other relatives, although blood related, did not suffer health effects after his passing, yet they could have easily thought their grief was \"bigger\" because of the relation. I think you shouldn't think negatively on the matter and just ask for time to give it some consideration.

Just because she was your mom, doesn't mean she didn't have other close relationships. Other people miss her. You're going through grief negatively. Keeping it to yourself doesn't keep the memory alive and it also doesn't tarnish it. Sharing it is nice because it keeps her memory alive. If you're the only one with anything to remember her by then you just want everyone to forget her????? I sense jealousy about them getting close and enjoying the art. You know this was the one thing she had with your mom and your being horrible to her for it. Souns like she was there to see or help your moms work in action so if there's enough to share even just one, then you should. You're looking at this as a very negative thing because of jealousy and grief. Tell them to give you time to think, but would your mom really want you to be behaving like this ? It takes more energy for all this", "I am so sorry. Losing your mom is so difficult, and sometimes the heartbreak is new every day. \n\nPlease have a one on one conversation with your dad. Ask him to put into words what you cannot right now to everyone else: \u201cI lost my mom less than 6 months ago, and it is only now that I can bear to even look at what was left behind let alone give something away. I know that Eve looked up to mom and I know they shared a love of art. But these paintings are a literal part of mom. I can no more get my mom back than I can give pieces of her away. Maybe, possibly in the future I may be able to, but not now and not in the foreseeable future. Eve and everyone else needs to respect this and respect my grieving process.

Would they appreciate it if they mum/dad/partner/child had died and you ganging up on them for a painting/piece of jewellery etc.\n\nI would also probably hit a bit low and tell Eve that she cannot imagine what you are feeling to going through as she still has her mum.  And that you would give away all the paintings if it meant you could have more time with yours.\n\nTell them that their timing was absolutely inappropriate and at some point in the future you probably have gifted a painting or 2 to Eve but it\u2018s evident that she cares more about materialistic items then she does her family mental health and feelings.  Also tell you dad and your boyfriend to either back you up or back off!!", "NTA - your grief is too new. Too big. The more they try to push you, the more you\u2019re gonna push back. And then nobody is going to be happy. Just tell them to leave you alone for now. You need some time to process and you are not available to make any decisions like that right this second. And if they had any respect for your mom, they should/will respect you. If not, they don\u2019t deserve anything. You may change your mind and give gift something down the road. If you don\u2019t, that\u2019s fine too. They are yours to do it as you please.. .", "YTA very very softly. I get you miss your mom, and this must be an emotionally devastating time for you. I don\u2019t think anyone would blame you for feeling so distraught and wanting to hang on to the things that remind you of your mother. \n\nBut Eve had a relationship with her too, and she\u2019s family. That might not have been her mother, but that was her creative mentor. Someone she aspired to and pursued her craft because of. And all she\u2019s asking is for one or two paintings that can be there to remind her of her mentors passion for the craft. Plus, if you keep in good with Eve, you\u2019ll be a part of each others life forever. You\u2019ll never truly lose the art, you\u2019ll just have another location (Eve\u2019s house) where you are reminded of your mothers positive influence and legacy. How is that a bad thing? \n\nObviously no one can force you to give over the art, it\u2019s yours to do with as you see fit, but I think it would mean a hell of a lot to Eve for you to share.", "YTA\n\nI am sorry for your loss and am assuming your behavior is due to grief.  Eve isn't some random step-sibling who didn't even know your mother, your mother and her shared something, she was an important person to her, as you said they had a bond. \n\nTo not allow Eve to have a single one when it sounds like there is quite a bit is selfish. She lost her as well and clearly wants to have something to remind her of your mom. \n\nYou are both grieving, and neither of you acting your best. I hope with time you two can come to an agreement.", "I agree, NTA. She was YOUR Mom. Stand your ground!", "Esh.\n\nObviously, Eve and her mother are in the wrong for pushing it and ganging up on you like that.\n\nHowever, I do think your pain is clouding your judgment. It sounds like your mother left behind a lot of paintings behind and that she was like a second mother to your sister during a period in her life that her parents were prioritizing another child. I think you should have tried to compromise and picked out a painting to give her. Or gently told her that the loss is still too fresh and you're not ready to part with them but would revist it the future. Instead, it sounds like you're making a competition out of grief and dismissing your sisters connection to your mother.\nObviously, you're the most impacted by your mother's loss, but people are going to mourn her too and want to hold on to her memory as well.\n\nNow that Eve and her mother have pushed, I get that you're probably even less willing to give Eve a painting. However, if you think there's any possibility of you regreting it in the future, I suggest that you reach out to Eve. Calmly tell her that you are hurt by how she approached things while you are mourning your mother. Acknowledge that you understand that she's also mourning, but she should be able to understand that you are still in a very emotional space after losing your mother and you're simply not ready to lose certain belongings of hers. Tell her that you need the issue to be tabled until the wound is not so fresh and you are in a better emotional state.", "NAH You win in grief hierarchy but she\u2019s still a person and she\u2019s still grieving too", "NAH, I can understand why you wouldn't want to part with them.

Once the grief was less raw, I was able to share some of his things with appropriate family members. You may find that\u2019s true for you, too\u2014 or not. Either way, now isn\u2019t the time to make huge decisions like this. \n\nThe idea others shared about making prints might go over well with Eve, and either way, you\u2019re allowed to grieve in your own time. \n\nI am very sorry for your loss and for the added difficulty of the drama your stepfamily is adding to it.", "NTA. Because they keep pressing the ask, and ignoring your grief.", "Soft YTA because you are grieving but Eve had a shared relationship with your mom and art and spent a ton of time with her as well. Bonds are way more than blood and if they spent as much time together as you say and she fostered the love of art in her, it would only be right.\n\nHow many are there? For her to have one or two makes complete sense.", "YTA.\n\nI feel for you, I really do. I hoard stuff from my family like a dragon. But your mom loved Eve, and Eve returned the favor. Not only that, but your mother's passion and talent for art lives on in Eve-- Eve's love and practice of art are some of the pieces of soul your mom left behind.\n\nEve knew your mom most of her life, and it sounds like your mother had an immeasurable impact on her. She also clearly saw herself as part of your family. Your behavior is telling her that she never was. As bad as you feel about her and Ana right now, Eve is feeling the same about you. \n\nI also want to encourage you to think about something-- if your mom could see you now, refusing to share the thing that bonded the three of you together, do you think she would be happy? She doesn't sound like the kind of woman who would be glad that you're keeping them for yourself, or proud of you for standing your ground here. Would your mom really have kept her art from Eve, with whom she made so much of it?", "YTA - her and your mother bonded over art and you\u2019re refusing to give up any of them. You\u2019re grief is speaking and you\u2019re playing the Oppression Olympics on who has it worse.\n\nShe waited until you started going through the things to organize them.

If you wanted everything she had and you didn't want to give a single knick knack away, you would still be NTA.\n\nYes, Eve had a relationship with her, but it wasn't the same as what you had. And maybe in a few years time you may decide to let a painting or two go.

It's not unreasonable for her to ask for some art memory for herself.\n\nYou have your mom's journals, and you will presumably have some of the art even if you share.   It's not going to hurt you to let your sister have a one or two of the paintings.  She is grieving too.", "I hate to call you the AH since your loss is tragic. I understand how you feel. I also understand Eve\u2019s perspective. I personally think that Eve is deserving of a piece of your mom too, since they were so close and really bonded over art. Would you consider loaning one to Eve? Maybe like a museum where you sign a contract with her, and then in six months or a year or two she could switch the pieces out for a different one? That way they are technically yours but she can feel close to your mom? And you can always revisit it/change your mind about permanently gifting her one, or even once the first loan term is up deciding that right now it\u2019s too hard and not continuing doing it?", "YTA. Your mom shared this passion with both of you and cared for her. From the way you portray your mom, your mom would probably want to share her art with Eve. Some of it should be shared since your mother fostered it in you two and Eve will be inspired as an artist just like your mom wanted it.", "I'm sorry for your loss. Losing a parent is devastating, especially when it's sudden and unexpected. Grief affects us all differently, and the sharing of heirlooms and memories is often fraught even in straightforward situations.\n\nYTA for refusing to share a single piece of your mother's art, but you're also deep in grief (and so is Eve) and grief makes us As at times. A lot of becoming an adult is learning that other people cannot see our internal state of we hide it, and that we cannot see other people's internal state if they hide it. Clearly Eve HAS waited for you to be ready to face dealing with your mother's belongings. She probably felt that this was a positive development that you might be ready to discuss how your mother's art - precious to both of you - might be split. Clearly you're not there yet, but she's not evil for this misunderstanding.\n\nTry to forgive Eve and your family for this. Understand that everyone grieves differently. Everyone's grief over the loss of your mother is real and true and deep and affecting their decision making. If you have the capacity, tell Eve that you're not ready to talk about splitting you mom's art yet but that you will be ready in a month or so. That you appreciate that your mom was a mom too her too for 15 years and that her art was precious to both of you. But for now you need a little bit more space to grieve.", "I am sorry for your loss.

Be kind.", "So let me get this straight: your mom is nice enough to spend time with Eve when none of her own parents are paying her any attention and she repays it by trying to take your mom\u2019s stuff from you?!?\nHeck No!

Would your mom have wanted Eve to have some of the paintings had she sorted through the paintings and called them out in a will before she died? Would she have hoped that you would share her talent and memories with Eve given her passing? While your grief is understandable, this should be about what your mom would\u2019ve wanted.", "YTA. You are being selfish. It would not hurt you to let Eve have one painting of someone who meant a lot to her too. Your reaction is pretty extreme in my opinion, especially the bitterness over Eve interacting with her mom (like a normal person) and her mom (like a normal person) speaking to you. You need therapy to deal with your emotions. It\u2019s more than grief. You have a lot of jealousy and resentment that\u2019s showing through.", "YTA I know you're grieving, and I know it is hard, but you had a chance to continue to share your mothers art and legacy with your sister.

What would your mother have wanted?", "The hypocrisy of their behavior is astounding.  I am so very sorry for your loss.  True, if Eve and Ava had been a little less self-centered, you may have come around to parting with a painting or two.  Of course, your mother could have given Eve a piece herself if she'd wanted to.  You DID offer Eve a different option (several of them, in fact) as a memento, which she very ungraciously refused.  As it stands, I'd make it very clear to them that the more they harangue you about parting with YOUR MOTHER'S things, the more resolved you are that you made the correct choice.  Also, make it very clear to them that their continued harassment of you during an incredibly difficult time won't be tolerated.  I'd recommend going LC with the two of them for the immediate future and I'd be very clear to your dad that if he presses the issue, you'll follow suit for him.

Look to see if there are two that give you similar feelings when you look at them. Maybe they share a color story or subject matter. Maybe one of those you could offer to Eve. \n\nI think with time you'll want to be able to talk to Eve about your Mom.

Go to your moms & do what it was you intended to do. Pack your moms art carefully & store them away for a few months. Then you grieve. Wake up the next day & breath in & out. Then grieve some more. Or don\u2019t. There is no textbook way to grieve. It comes & goes.  \n\nNow, here is a suggestion to help give you time to decide whether you want to keep your moms art wrapped & stored away or to showcase then in your home.  And to assist Eve, who wasn\u2019t related to your mom but did have a relationship with her, with her grief.   Write Eve a letter. Tell her you are sorry for dismissing her & her feelings toward your mother. Ask her to understand that right now, you can\u2019t think straight & are emotionally compromised. You need time. Lots of time. And at the end of that time, maybe 6 months? Maybe a year. Or two. There is no expiration date for grief & no rush to be okay. And that you will consider her request & ask that she respect your wishes & give you space to handle all these emotions. And also, getting other family members involved was a terrible thing to do & that you feel very attacked. This was YOUR mother. you feel overwhelmed & lost. It wasn\u2019t fair of her to get others involved to emotionally bully you & that if it continues then you will not be able to ever feel objective nor happy to possibly give her any of your mothers art. As of right now, you feel angry & disgusted with the entire situation. But if she gives you the space & time, you hope that the two of you will be able to one day come together & talk about how much your mom meant to the both of you.", "NAH\n\nBut I would hope despite your grief you can acknowledge your step sis and mom had a deep, unique bond too. \n\nMy mother is a wonderful painter and I paint similarly to her. My sis is more talented at sewing and knitting, something me and my mom don't do well, but BOTH us daughters each have a few of mom's paintings. \n\nYou're not obligated to share any paintings, you are not the bad guy for refusing, but it would be an incredibly generous thing to do.", "NAH", "Nah. But I\u2019d ask yourself what you honestly think your mother would have wanted and would go from there.", "NTA. Like you mentioned, you may have felt differently in the future, but the way Eve and Anna are behaving right now is selfish and entitled. You have the right to grieve however you need to. Do not let them make you feel bad or bully you into submission.", "NTA.  I would shoot straight with Eve.  She has no idea of the grief you\u2019re feeling.  She may have lost someone she admired and was even a little close to, but you lost your mother - and she still has hers.  Bluntly tell her she cannot understand your pain and right now is not a good time to ask you to give up any part of your mom you have left.\n\nBut now you have drama in the family because of this.  Tell Eve that you hear and understand why she is making this request.  While right now, your grief is too fresh to part with any paintings, you will consider it again down the road, BUT only if she and the rest of your family back off.  If at a later time, you feel differently, you will let her know.  But if she cannot drop it at a time you are experiencing some of the worst pain on your life, then she will lose the opportunity permanently.\n\nEve and the rest of your family should have enough sense and love not to push you on this, but if bargaining that you\u2019ll reconsider down the road buys you some time and space from the drama, it may be worth it.", "It's too soon.

I have witnessed my parents and their siblings squabble and hold long term resentments with each other when divvying up their parents' things after they died. It's silly. Your mom sounds like she was a very loving person, who was happy to share her kindness with someone who was not her own. What makes you more deserving of the relics of that love than your step sibling? And what, exactly, will you lose by letting your sister have a painting of your mom's? \n\nI know your grieving and like others said, I would ask for some time. But I do think that you receive what you put out, if you catch my drift. If you put out love, kindness, generosity just like your mother did, then you will get it in return.

I completely sympathize with Eve for asking for one of the paintings. \n\nYou need to sit down and really consider what your mother would have wanted.

But one shirt would mean the world to me. He went thru the closet and separated 4 out of the group and I chose one of those. Win win. \n\nYour grief is real and I\u2019m sorry.

I really think when the shock and numbness wear off, you will come to regret the way you are alienating your family.
