Over quarantine, my husband introduced me to his favorite anime, a long-running one that he\u2019s watched since he was a kid. I pretty much immediately latched onto the interactions between the two (ostensibly straight) main characters and got really into the fanfic community surrounding them. Like, \u201cwriting multiple hundreds of thousands of words about them\u201d into it. I\u2019ll admit that I went overboard and landed in the realm of obsession instead of just enjoying. That\u2019s a separate issue. \nThe problem is that my husband feels hurt that I\u2019m so interested in a gay relationship between the heroes of his childhood, who he always saw as straight. When he asks me what I\u2019m reading or writing, I either have to brush off the question with a \u201cyou don\u2019t really want to know\u201d or risk traumatizing him- I think he actually retched the first time I got descriptive (think, \u201ctrying to figure out how A would do B in a bathroom stall\u201d). It\u2019s not the gay-ness; I can tell him about the same things in the context of original fiction and that\u2019s fine, interesting even. The problem for him is that it\u2019s these characters specifically. \nSo. Am I the asshole for continuing to defile his heroes?", "created_utc": 1696531917, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170pzo2/aita_for_writing_gay_fanfic_of_my_husbands/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But don't be surprised if he keeps his other childhood joys a secret", "NTA. As long as you aren't shoving it in his face or making him read it, there should be nothing wrong with it.

Don't watch, don't read.\n\nIt's time your husband learns about fanfiction, yaoi, slash, BL and of course Fujoshis, who you are.\n\nFanfiction has always existed in any and everything fandom, and it's only normal to find fishy the relation between two people who (for example) spend their time chasing each other like they are totally obsessed with the other.\n\nThere is only a thin line between  hate and love, and I don't see why it should be limited to heterosexual couples.\n\nI think here it is your husband's homophobia and fragile masculinity speaking.\n\nHe loves these characters for certain personal reasons, you have other reasons.

Your husband can write his own fanfic as an alternative one if he isn't OK with what you do.", "Probably NTA.   I would get a laugh out of it and respect your creativity.   I think he's too sensitive.", "NTA this is so weird lol. It's fictional character not real people and you aren't writing any dark content where he would maybe have an argument for not liking it and wanting you to stop. It's just fanfic. He doesn't have to read it or be into it but he also can't force you to stop.", "NTA - 2 years back my husband made me watch dragon z with him. It went and looked up Vegeta fan fiction. He was thought it was hilarious.", "Nta but if I was your husband I would never share anything with you that I enjoyed.", "NAH\n\nIts kind of cute in a way that you are getting so into a show that he loves, but also I can't really blame him for being weirded out by it. It also sounds like the obsession with you ship has gotten a bit out of control too. \n\nYTA if you don't tell us what show it is though.", "NTA, you don't need to stop writing about them, but you also don't need to keep telling him about it. If he asks what you're writing or reading just say fanfic and leave it at that. \n\nOne thing that stuck out to me was you saying he feels hurt that you're interested in this ship. He shouldn't feel hurt by your actions, you haven't done anything to him to hurt him. I'm not sure if that's his wording or yours, but if it was him saying he actually feels emotionally hurt about you writing these stories, that feels a little manipulative of him. He can see the topic as something he doesn't like or want to engage in, but it doesn't make sense for it to emotionally wound him to have you write stories he doesn't have to read. \n\nI think it's fair if he needs a boundary of \"these are my childhood heros, I do not want to hear about them being sexualized\" but the way to hold that boundary is for you to not tell him the details when you engage in this kind of fanfic, not for you to stop engaging in a hobby you enjoy.", "Husband is entitled to his feelings, but you also aren't technically doing anything wrong. You're allowed to ship those characters and interact with them however you want. Maybe don't tell Husband about it too much if it makes him uncomfortable, but tbh it's up to you whether you want to keep writing about them or not. I vote NAH", "NTA, but you might want to try to find another ship to keep the peace. Or just make it more private and not involve him at all, keep your reading and writing of it to when he is not around. I think your writing is yours and you should enjoy it while trying to be respectful of his feelings.\n\nDamn I'm curious about who it is though...", "Only if it\u2019s Dragonball Z\n\nThat would be unforgivable", "if you want to make him regret asking, you can always ask him to examine his default assumptions. why did he always see these characters as straight? is there something wrong with one or the other (or both) characters not being heterosexual? what if one of them was transgender?\n\nNTA, hopefully this can be a learning experience for him (at the very least to stop asking questions he doesnt want to hear the answers to LOL)", "No, it IS the gayness. He doesn't care when it's other fiction because it's not characters he's already very attached to. It's extremely weird how important it is to him that these characters be straight.", "This has no real right answer I feel. Neither are really Assholes, so NAH I guess?You are doing the right thing, trying to minimize telling him about it, caring about his comfort on it. This is definitely not about him being homophobic either...but rather it's uncomfortable seeing his childhood heros in a different light that he isn't open to, so he's not really wrong either.\n\nHonestly I think you doing the right thing in general, trying to tone down how much you mention it and such.", "YTA \n\nThis is your husband's thing - let him have his thing. You could write gay fan fiction about anything else, you're being selfish.", "NAH but YTA if you keep doing it.\n\nThere are thousands upon thousands of different characters in anime you could ship, but by doing two that are memorable to your partner you are telling them \"fuck off.\"\n\nIf my wife did not like garlic and I continued to cook dishes with garlic then I am telling her that she really doesn't matter in my life. That my desires are more important than hers. That this is not a partnership, but instead two individuals that happen to live together.", "YTA so you obsessed over something you know your husband does not like and continue to do it.  That's all this boils down to. You obsessively doing something that your husband has expressed he dislikes and makes him uncomfortable yet you have to ask if you are an asshole.", "NAH", "NAH if you do it on your own and don\u2019t tell him about it. If he asks you can say you continue to write fanfic about a number of universes and you\u2019d rather not discuss it with him to avoid any discomfort for either of you. People are entitled to their private hobbies.", "I'm leaning slightly toward YTA.\n\nIt's nice that you are interested in the things he is interested in. But as a general rule it is kind of inconsiderate to \"poach\" and/or \"spoil\" things in people's innermost circles.\n\nIf this were just one of many things your husband enjoys, it would feel like less of a social faux pas. But if this truly is like his *favorite* piece of media, did you really need to detract from what is probably one of the most important things he has?\n\nIt's not even about the gayness or the sexual explicitness (although maybe I could see his position as being potentially unreasonable if homoeroticism were actually implied in the series). It's about inserting yourself quite specifically into the very scope of things they identify, and commandeering them.\n\nTo use a metaphor: the entire world was open to explore, you could go and take a dump on any piece of media you wanted. But instead of taking the care, and courage, and time to do literally anything else, you chose to take a dump in your husband's bed. And yeah, it's just fanfic, so on the spectrum of seriousness it's quite mild versus things like stealing your friend's fuckbuddy/paramour or taking over their passion project. But however mild, I think that's just kind of inconsiderate.", "This is ridiculous. Your husband is homophobic af.", "NAH, but it could be one of those hobbies or things you enjoy for yourself. I can see where he is coming from, but I don't see any right or wrong here.", ">It\u2019s not the gay-ness\n\nYeah, it's the \"sexualizing children's media\" that would be grossest to me. You're free to do that, but being borderline obsessed with sexualizing children's TV show characters is going to make a lot of people uncomfortable. \"Oh I'm just writing about Mr. Hooper pegging Gordon.\" That shit would weird me out. NAH.", "INFO: Has he asked you to stop? Has he told you it makes him uncomfortable?\n\nIf yes on either of those, you would be the asshole. To him, these characters are his childhood. To you, they are characters you first \"met\" only a few years ago. While you have the right to your own fantasies, if you were my GF and I'd find out you were writing ship fics about my clearly not into each other favorite characters irrelevent of sexuality, I don't think I'd ever share something that important with you again for fear of the memory being corrupted again.", "YTA, if it was anybody else writing them, I would say N T A.\n\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with gay shipping fanfiction but in this specific scenario is what make it YTA, context matters.\n\nYour husband shared something of great sentimental value from his childhood with you and IMHO your chosen course of actions is disrespectful of the place that show and those character have in your husband's life.", "YTA\n\nFrom your husband's point of view, you have taken something he's loved since childhood and put it in a different, more sexual context. It's possible that your husband is being homophobic, but it's also possible he's just upset that you've ignored the canonical attributes (such as sexuality) of characters he has loved for years.\n\nI'm actually focused on why you do this in the first place. Why do you write steamy gay fanfic about ostensibly straight characters? That's kind of weird, if you were a gay man it would seem like wish fulfilment but since you're not it seems fetishistic. There's actually a long history of straight women fetishizing gay male relationships in fandom - I believe the first *Star Trek* zines were full of Kirk/Spock smut - but that doesn't make it any less strange.\n\nFinally, with a whole world of TV, movies, and games to draw inspiration from, you could just as easily write about characters your husband doesn't care about - but you're choosing to write about his favorites, even though you know it makes him uncomfortable. It's true that he can't call \"dibs\" on a fandom, but are you really being a good partner to your husband by doing this?\n\nBy the way, this whole situation is why I've never understood the nerds that want to  date other nerds. It would be nice to date someone that shared all my same hobbies and interests, but only if they liked them in exactly the same way that I did.

YTA", "Yes", "Most likely NAH (like 99%): This is only a complicated one because there are a few scenarios where it could be an AH move, but really, the main idea is simple: if he was a kid that didn't have a father, and you just knowingly perverted his view of childhood heroes that were his archetypes for male role models, then that's a massive AH move, otherwise NAH.", "Why not do it away from him? Is his discomfort a key part of the experience?", "YTA, you purposely went out of your way to ruin your husband's childhood hero's and still continued after finding out he didn't like it.", "NTA unless it\u2019s another Zoro x Sanji.", "Did you continue after he told you how he felt?", "yta for being 30 and writing fan fiction grow up and get a job", "NTA because no one here is the asshole.
