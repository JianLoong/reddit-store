{"id": 10773, "submission_id": "11ah3x6", "title": "AITA for selling my brother's and SIL's belongings and keeping all of the earnings for my niece?", "selftext": "A month ago, my brother and SIL died in a car accident. They left behind my niece, Isla 1F, and no will to state their wishes for her or their home. \n\nMy SIL's family immediately stated their intentions to not take in Isla. From my understanding, no one on that side of the family is financially stable. My SIL's mother works a part time job at Walmart, and her sister has 5 of her own kids who struggled in school and who are perfectly content with working part time retail jobs and living paycheck to paycheck. In the same conversation regarding Isla's future, my SIL's family keenly inquired about taking the cars (both are paid off and are less than 3 years old), taking the TV (Sony 65 inch), taking furniture, and splitting whatever money is left over from my brother's and SIL's accounts after their estates have been settled. Honestly, I don't think the sum of their accounts is a lot because my brother and I would often talk finances. I think they maybe had $5000 between them. \n\nTo be blunt, I was livid. My husband and I immediately stated that Isla would be staying with us, and additionally, outside of any sentimental items, the majority of the remaining possessions would be sold in an estate sale, along with the cars,  with 100% of the earnings being put into a bank account and college savings account for Isla because I imagine that her parents would have wanted that for her. They hadn't opened a bank account for her, so we decided to get that started.  Our son, Luke, is the same age as Isla, and we would want for her to be set financially, just as we have started for Luke. \n\n\nSIL's family fought back, saying that isn't fair. They lost SIL and she would most definitely have wanted for them to have some of their things. Her mother and nephew really want the cars because they can't afford ones of their own, but also, they aren't offering to help with raising Isla. They said they'll babysit if needed, but she'll have to figure out her own finances down the road if she decides to go to college. They said \"if\" because none of them went to college, and they figure Isla might not go either.\n\nAm I in the wrong to deny them the cars or some non-sentimental belongings? I'm honestly 100% thinking of Isla and making sure she gets everything her parents have left for her. I think she deserves everything. This isn't to say that my husband and I won't contribute to her growing funds. We will, of course, be adding more to her savings and college funds, just as we do for Luke. My family will also be contributing.\n\nAITA? Please advise.\n\nEDIT: We have a lawyer and we are going through the proper legal channels here. But the question I am asking everyone is the ethical dilemma of are we being too harsh in denying my SIL's family the non-sentimental property that they're asking for? Like the cars, big electronics, furniture, etc.\n\nEDIT 2: Wow, thank you to everyone for your kind words, advice, and condolences. I've read a lot about keeping this whole situation a legal matter and working with our attorney to do all the talking with my SIL's family. To answer a few questions and confirm some things, we are definitely going to adopt Isla. She's been staying with us ever since the accident and she's adjusting well to being here. The first two weeks were the hardest I think, as we slowly changed her schedule to match Luke's, and she's been such a trooper. We used some of her parents clothes and blankets for her to snuggle into throughout the day, and we've already put away family photographs, their wedding album, and quite a few other personal effects away for her to revisit in the future. \n\nAs for SIL's family, they've been reaching out on social media and via text message (mostly going unanswered by me and addressed by our attorney), and hopefully they'll shape up so they can stay in Isla's life. I do think my SIL would have wanted her daughter to at least know her family, but after this, I can't think of letting them be alone with her, so we'll do supervised visits, hangouts, and family parties. \n\nOnce again, we deeply appreciate all of you for your input. If anything major happens, I'll be sure to post an update. For now, the weather is unusually tolerable for February, so we're  busting out the wagon and taking the kids to the park.
