{"id": 1374, "submission_id": "ymbxj5", "title": "AITA For Refusing To Forgive My Sister And Not Inviting Her To My Wedding?", "selftext": "Throwaway Account\n\nI (30m) have a sister \"Julie\" (25f) and she is in line to inherit our great-grandmother's ring as the first born female through our mom's side. My girlfriend \"Laura\" (26f) saw the ring and thought it was gorgeous and said that one day she'd like to have a ring just like that. Now, I know what you're thinking if you've seen other Reddit posts but Laura isn't the type to actually expect me to give her that exact ring just something like it.\n\nI wanted to propose to Laura and because I knew that she wanted a ring just like that one I decided to pay to have a custom one made. I showed the jewelry maker pictures but they said that it would be better if they could actually see it in-person. I went to my mom (the current holder of the ring) explained the situation and even showed the invoice before asking if I could borrow it. She agreed and so I took the ring.\n\nThe jewelry maker held on to it for about 48 hours and when I was about to head back to my parent's place with the ring, I got a phone call that Laura was in an accident and at the hospital. I rushed over to the hospital with her family and was horrified to hear that she needed immediate surgery. I honestly couldn't really think of anything else other than my girlfriend and stayed with her mom and sister the entire time. I was so relieved when the doctor's said that she was going to be okay and agreed to drive Laura's sister back to the house and then come back.\n\nI dropped Laura's sister off and when back to my place to shower when I saw the police there waiting for me with my parents and Julie. Julie then ran over to me calling me a thief and demanded her ring. Apparently Julie found out that mom gave me the ring and assumed that I lied about just borrowing it. My parents tried to calm her down but when I wouldn't pick up (bad cell reception at the hospital/phone died) Laura called the police. I handed Julie the ring right then and there and told my family about Laura before walking into my apartment.\n\nI also saw that Julie had trashed me all over social media but almost everyone was apologetic when I and Laura's sister explained everything. Julie took down her posts but never apologized. I proposed to Laura once she had recovered, she said \"yes\" and we're preparing for the wedding. Laura asked my other sister \"Annie\" (21f) to be a bridesmaid and when Julie asked if she was going to be one Laura and I informed her that she wasn't invited. Julie is calling me bitter and that I had no reason to still be angry with her. My parents think I'm being too harsh by not at least inviting her but I'm still angry. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Because I keep seeing this in the comments or in the DMs\n\n1. Julie took down the post(s) the following day she got the ring back.\n2. Julie thinks that I made myself look guilty by not responding to the multiple calls and texts that I received before the called the police.\n3. I'm not sure what Julie said or did to convince the police to come with her but all I know is that she was trying to report a theft.\n4. My parents didn't arrive with Julie or the police, they showed up after and was arguing with her with I arrived.\n5. My parents were on my side about being upset with Julie but feels that since it was a year since the mistake/misunderstanding that it was time to let things go.\n6. Julie has read a lot of stories on Reddit about sibling stealing each others possessions and I think that it got to her when it came to the ring.\n7. My mom told Julie I borrowed the ring when Julie stopped by to borrow it for an event.\n\nETA 2: For all the people who think this is fake because I won't give details about how Julie got the police to arrive at my place, I wasn't THERE when she actually called the cops so I don't know that part and no I didn't bother to ask after the fact because A) I was too upset at the fact that she even called the police in the first place B) I stopped talking to Julie C) I was more focused on Laura.\n\nAlso my parents were already talking to the police when I arrived trying to explain the situation. It's not like my mom had physical proof of ownership (it's just a verbal agreement/understanding) so the police had to ask questions and mediate the situation, but once I handed the ring back the issue was considered dropped.\n\nI don't know if Julie got in trouble for calling the cops and I frankly didn't care.", "created_utc": 1667599649, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymbxj5/aita_for_refusing_to_forgive_my_sister_and_not/", "score": 3103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would assume she only wants to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a family even and everyone else will be there etc. she also hasn\u2019t actually said sorry or acknowledged any wrongdoing so why should you move on. MTA", "NTA. Your sister tried to file a police report on a ring that she didn\u2019t even own yet - it still belongs to your mother. Added to that, your mother told her very clearly what was going on, she basically called your mom a liar too.", "NTA. Wasn't her ring. Wasn't her buisness. If she hasn't apologized, I don't see why you should feel obligated to invite her to your wedding. This sort of lack of closeness is the cost of nastiness without even the pretense of remorse.", "NTA- I would have done the exact same thing. Tell your parents one more word about it and they aren't invited either. Julie is lucky that you didn't sue her for slander", "Nta", "i would've posted a rebuttal for everyone on soc media and explain what happened, incl the part where she took down the posts and refused to apologize. then tell everyone this will no longer be discussed, the ring debacle or her absence at the wedding. reiterate that ppl trying to push further discussions will be blocked and not invited as well. NTA", "NTA. She nuked the relationship the moment she called the cops. Frankly, if I were your mom, the youngest daughter would now be getting the family ring, since it wasn't Julie's to even call the cops over!", "NTA. She had no standing to call the cops in the first place since its your mom's ring, not hers. She blew up over something trivial, went absolutely nuclear in smearing you AND Laura, never apologized, and expects to be treated like everything is all hunky-dory? That's not how this works. Weddings aren't the venue for relationship repair. That happens long before the wedding.", "First of all your sister is EXTREMELY greedy and immature.  What kind of relationship did you have with your sister prior to this incident because she \u201cassumed that you lied about just borrowing it\u201d. Why would she immediately assume that?  Your mother was telling her the truth and she didn\u2019t believe your mom.  To actually call the police states a lot even if you couldn\u2019t answer your phone at the moment.  What was she going to do send you to jail, really?!  Your parents think you\u2019re being to harsh but I don\u2019t and you\u2019re not being bitter.  She needs to put on her big girl panties and make this situation right by any means possible and your parents need to stop enabling her bad behavior.", "I think it's ridiculous that your fianc\u00e9e wants a ring just like your furure sister's ring.   You and your fianc\u00e9e are ridiculous at copying.  Real TA\n\nYTA", "Good for you for backing your fianc\u00e9 and not caving to your parents about your sister.", "Why didn\u2019t your mom point out to Julie that mom still owned the ring?", "I have adult daughters and if any of them did ANY of this shit with the jewelry they were SUPPOSED to be inheriting, I would melt that fucker down, sell it, and use the proceeds towards a trip somewhere.", "NTA!!!!  Is she really your sister? Does she even know you. I would never talk to my sister again if she thought I was going to steal something that belongs to her. I would be Devastated that she has such a horrible opinion of me. Personally I need therapy to get over it, but I'm close with my siblings.", "NTA. This! Julie should not be at your wedding.", "She would not be at my wedding even if she crawled to apologize. But I am petty", "Amen\nAnd make\nSure shes arrested and tresspassed if she shows up  uninvited", "I would guard the ring julie might do something stupid", "Nothing - and I mean nothing - worked better in encouraging my sons to treat each other well when they were growing up than requiring a 4-part apology when one treated the other badly. It really did change their behavior.", "Nope. It\u2019s Mum\u2019s ring until Mum dies & Julie inherits. Ring is in Mum\u2019s possession bc it belongs to Mum, and Mum is the only person who can lend it out.  It\u2019s not Julie\u2019s ring.", "I'd honestly turn it back on Julie. Like why would she want to go to your wedding if she's so quick to think of you as a thief?", "NTA. I know you probably don't want to deal with this situation anymore. But if you are curious, you may be able to get a copy of the police report. I would also remind your family that your sister never apologized to you for making an already traumatic day worse. Nor has she expressed any remorse for her false allegations.  You have lost your trust in your sister and she has done nothing to try to gain it back. Her being at the wedding would, at this point, just be a reminder of the worse day of your life. If your sister is truly sorry for her what she did, she needs to show it to you in words and actions. If she is unwilling to do that, then there is no way you will be comfortable with her at your wedding.", "Ah ok, I see. For some reason I thought Annie was asked in front of Julie or something. My bad.\n\nI feel terrible for all of you. I think the maddest I\u2019ve ever been at my sister lasted 4 days. I don\u2019t think I could go a full year at being mad at her. But at the same time, if she called the cops on me and didn\u2019t apologize\u2026well, I get it.\n\nHow is Annie and Julie\u2019s relationship with each other, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?", "I honestly think youre right, this has angry sibling vibes", "I mean. Idk why this would be the sticking point. It's not like mom would have a receipt since she inherited it too, and it wasn't even left to her in a will to show them. As far as they're concerned it's a disputed ownership", "She assumed that for no reason so that makes it worse in my opinion. I would consider going on an info diet with her bc she does not trust you", "... What happened to your grandmother's and great-grandmother's diamonds?", "Oh I totally doubt the story. You can tell by how it's written as a story and not as if it's relaying events. But that's not the sticking point. And we aren't really supposed to call it out without \"proof\" around here", "Sad but typical story of how my sister and I were each supposed to get one diamond, but after my mom had a stroke and wasn't quite the same afterwards my sister got her to divide up the family jewelry when I wasn't there. And lo and behold she ended up with both (my grandmother reset them both in one ugly ring but the plan was to break it back up.) And there's no way I'm ever going to get one of my grandmothers' diamonds at this point. I really wish I had seen their original settings, one should have been Art Deco, but that was destroyed decades ago.", "NTA Julie jumped to massive AH levels here. If she sincerely apologizes before the wedding I would reconsider her attendance, but it would need to be one hell of an apology.", "NTA - Your sister called the police on you because you borrowed your mother's ring so a copy could be made and in the meantime your girlfriend is in a horrific accident and is in the hospital receiving care and you rush to her side . ..  After all the confusion and everything is straightened out . . . your sister never apologizes . . . . which indicates that she values a ring over her brother. Don't invite her to your wedding. Only people who value you and your wife to be should be invited to witness your vows.", "NTA until she realizes how bad she overreacted. it's disturbing how obsessed your sister is with a possession she doesn't even own yet. It's just been promised to her. Sounds like she is going to be an absolute nightmare later in life when inheritance comes around.", " NTA. What\u2019s with everyone posting about grandma\u2019s ring!", "NTA Has your great grandmother passed? Why does your mom hold the ring if it\u2019s Julie\u2019s?", "NTA but your sister and parents are. Julie\u2019s quick knee jerk reaction to call the police for a ring that doesn\u2019t even belong to her. I\u2019ll assume she has a history of being a spoiled, unreasonable jerk with people in general.", "ESH.\nJulie was wrong to accuse you and lie on you on social media, but since there was more than a year of a gap, you need to move on and forgive and you should have invited her", "When the cops are called on someone, it usually means an irreparable relationship break. NTA. The sister was willing to break sibling bonds with OP by calling the cops, she knew there\u2019s no coming back from that. In her mind, she has already broken the sibling bond when she thought OP had stolen the ring, and was willing to follow through with concrete actions since there was no more relationship bonds to consider. \n\ncan\u2019t blame OP for following the path set upon by the sister.", "D\nTet", "NTA.\n\n\nLet me see if I have this straight:\n\n\u2022 The ring currently belongs to your mother, even though it's 'promised' to your sister eventually\n\u2022 You borrowed the ring from your mother, and had it, what, 72 hours? (48 hours + a day at the hospital)\n\u2022 Your sister, for whatever reason, wanted the ring in that small window of time, and flipped out when your mother said you'd borrow it maybe 3 days ago\n\u2022 She called the cops and had them show up at your door - however she arranged that - for an item which she claimed to own, and claimed you had stolen\n\u2022 When the actual owner of the ring showed up, and tried to explain it to the cops, they still didn't leave until you handed the ring back to, who, your mother or your sister (hopefully mother, it's still her ring, after all)\n\n\nIt sounds to me that not only is your sister unhinged, at least about this ring, but by getting the cops to show up *at your door*, presumably at night, the only way any cops *I* know - and I used to work for a major police department - would do that would be for something far more serious than the theft of an item without very large intrinsic value, so she falsified a police report.  Tell Julie she's lucky that she didn't get in all kinds of trouble for that - you could have pursued it, and maybe civil action for lying to police about a crime *you didn't commit*, and then go at least LC with her, until she actually apologizes.", "NTA. Your sister went nuclear without even speaking to you. She just assumed the worst and called the police and slandered you on social media. If she\u2019s capable of doing this over a ring that you borrowed, and when she didn\u2019t bother to establish your intentions before going nuclear- what is she going to do in the future? Is she going to behave at the wedding? Future family functions? I don\u2019t think so", "100% NTA your sister needs to apologize before she could expect to be invited to your wedding... \nOP you have one difficult sister....", "So\u2026 just checking the timeline here. Julie read the recent stories on Reddit about ring-stealing, travelled back in time one year, had her ring stolen and called the cops?\n\nSeems legit.", "Yes. She and my maternal grandmother have been dead for years. My mom is the current holder/owner of the ring with the understanding that it will be Julie's when our mom dies.", "The incident with the ring happened last year. She was also reading Reddit stories about  family members taking each other's stuff since 2020. The issue now is that Laura and I are getting married and Julie isn't invited because of what happened last year.", "She thought I lied to our mom and was planning on keeping the ring.", "If she called from his place to report the the \"theft\" that's where the cops show up. And frankly all she had to do was call 911 and repot \"a\" theft.", "Has anyone asked Julie why she thought you lied instead of trusting you?", "NTA.  Your and Laura's wedding, so your choice.  I wouldn't be surprised if you both were just NC with her forever.  Just say 'Bye,' and be done.  Nothing else to say, really.", "Definitely NTA. It\u2019s so sad to see how little your sister thinks of you! She should apologize genuinely and should of posted a correct statement after she smeared you all over social media. She\u2019s ridiculously entitled and your parents are assholes to for trying to convince you to just forgive her when she won\u2019t even apologize! It wasn\u2019t even your sisters ring yet either to call and report stolen, it was your mom\u2019s still technically. Julie needs to grow up!", "NTA.  Your sister still needs to apologize.", "NTA.  Your now wife could have died. And your sister is more worried  about some stupid ring. NTA.  She shouldn't have  made the posts, and since she did she should have apologized!!!", "NTA. She went a bit too far in calling the police by assuming you took it. Sorry but she doesn\u2019t trust you and that says a lot.", "NTA, there isn't much else to say besides what u/pineboxwaiting put down. That's pretty much it.\n\nThough, I'm lost in the story why your sister thought you stole the ring that was in your mom's possession. There's some serious leaps in communication between them all (unless the ring was in your sister's possession and your mom took it from her things, in which you should have gone to your sister?) Like, a lot of this could have been avoided by including her from the start. Nonetheless, you've done nothing wrong.\n\nGood luck on the wedding!", "Dollars for donuts the sister misrepresented her ownership of the ring.", "I do as well  but julie may show\nUp", "Curious if there\u2019s a history on why she\u2019d immediately go to that conclusion. Putting myself in Julie\u2019s shoes, If I wanted something for an event and another family member borrowed said item to have it replicated, a simple question would be what\u2019s the eta on it? This jump to thievery is extreme.", "You don't get to apologize after you involve the police.  You had permission to borrow the ring for a specific purpose and your sister's actions and behavior during an emergency situation sets the tone for your relationship going forward.  It's sad but she thought more of herself and that ring, than she did you or your future."]}
