{"id": 1374, "submission_id": "ymbxj5", "title": "AITA For Refusing To Forgive My Sister And Not Inviting Her To My Wedding?", "selftext": "Throwaway Account\n\nI (30m) have a sister \"Julie\" (25f) and she is in line to inherit our great-grandmother's ring as the first born female through our mom's side. My girlfriend \"Laura\" (26f) saw the ring and thought it was gorgeous and said that one day she'd like to have a ring just like that. Now, I know what you're thinking if you've seen other Reddit posts but Laura isn't the type to actually expect me to give her that exact ring just something like it.\n\nI wanted to propose to Laura and because I knew that she wanted a ring just like that one I decided to pay to have a custom one made. I showed the jewelry maker pictures but they said that it would be better if they could actually see it in-person. I went to my mom (the current holder of the ring) explained the situation and even showed the invoice before asking if I could borrow it. She agreed and so I took the ring.\n\nThe jewelry maker held on to it for about 48 hours and when I was about to head back to my parent's place with the ring, I got a phone call that Laura was in an accident and at the hospital. I rushed over to the hospital with her family and was horrified to hear that she needed immediate surgery. I honestly couldn't really think of anything else other than my girlfriend and stayed with her mom and sister the entire time. I was so relieved when the doctor's said that she was going to be okay and agreed to drive Laura's sister back to the house and then come back.\n\nI dropped Laura's sister off and when back to my place to shower when I saw the police there waiting for me with my parents and Julie. Julie then ran over to me calling me a thief and demanded her ring. Apparently Julie found out that mom gave me the ring and assumed that I lied about just borrowing it. My parents tried to calm her down but when I wouldn't pick up (bad cell reception at the hospital/phone died) Laura called the police. I handed Julie the ring right then and there and told my family about Laura before walking into my apartment.\n\nI also saw that Julie had trashed me all over social media but almost everyone was apologetic when I and Laura's sister explained everything. Julie took down her posts but never apologized. I proposed to Laura once she had recovered, she said \"yes\" and we're preparing for the wedding. Laura asked my other sister \"Annie\" (21f) to be a bridesmaid and when Julie asked if she was going to be one Laura and I informed her that she wasn't invited. Julie is calling me bitter and that I had no reason to still be angry with her. My parents think I'm being too harsh by not at least inviting her but I'm still angry. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Because I keep seeing this in the comments or in the DMs\n\n1. Julie took down the post(s) the following day she got the ring back.\n2. Julie thinks that I made myself look guilty by not responding to the multiple calls and texts that I received before the called the police.\n3. I'm not sure what Julie said or did to convince the police to come with her but all I know is that she was trying to report a theft.\n4. My parents didn't arrive with Julie or the police, they showed up after and was arguing with her with I arrived.\n5. My parents were on my side about being upset with Julie but feels that since it was a year since the mistake/misunderstanding that it was time to let things go. \n6. Julie has read a lot of stories on Reddit about sibling stealing each others possessions and I think that it got to her when it came to the ring.\n7. My mom told Julie I borrowed the ring when Julie stopped by to borrow it for an event.

You allowed your sister to keep the original and even went above and beyond to ask your mom to borrow the ring for the sole purpose to recreate something similar to it so it would be just right for Laura. Even showing the proper paperwork and more. But when tragedy strikes and you aren\u2019t there to answer at that second because your SO is in emergency care, Julie hauls tail to your house with police and your parents (probably there to stop her). Julie went to far and even going as far as to slander you without probable cause. Plus at the end of the day you AND Laura didn\u2019t want Julie at your wedding the big event BOTH you and Laura paid for.

That hasn\u2019t happened though. So I\u2019m not bitter. I\u2019m just acknowledging reality. I get that engaging in denial by pretending everything is okay works well for you all, but I like reality. And reality is she treated us horribly and apparently thinks it was okay because she hasn\u2019t apologized. And no, people who think it\u2019s okay to treat me horribly are not invited to my wedding.\u201d", "NTa\n\n\"I'm not angry or bitter, I just don't like you.\"", "NTA and I would go No Contact with that person.

You two have a special day, glad Laura's okay.", "Wowza. NTA at all in my opinion. Shes the one who jumped to conclusions for absolutely no reason and never apologized for it. Even if she did, I wouldnt want her at my wedding. If she thinks so little of you, why would you want her there?", "NTA. Talk about over reaction.
