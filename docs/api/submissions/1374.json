My girlfriend \"Laura\" (26f) saw the ring and thought it was gorgeous and said that one day she'd like to have a ring just like that. Now, I know what you're thinking if you've seen other Reddit posts but Laura isn't the type to actually expect me to give her that exact ring just something like it.\n\nI wanted to propose to Laura and because I knew that she wanted a ring just like that one I decided to pay to have a custom one made. I showed the jewelry maker pictures but they said that it would be better if they could actually see it in-person. I went to my mom (the current holder of the ring) explained the situation and even showed the invoice before asking if I could borrow it. She agreed and so I took the ring.\n\nThe jewelry maker held on to it for about 48 hours and when I was about to head back to my parent's place with the ring, I got a phone call that Laura was in an accident and at the hospital. I rushed over to the hospital with her family and was horrified to hear that she needed immediate surgery. I honestly couldn't really think of anything else other than my girlfriend and stayed with her mom and sister the entire time. I was so relieved when the doctor's said that she was going to be okay and agreed to drive Laura's sister back to the house and then come back.\n\nI dropped Laura's sister off and when back to my place to shower when I saw the police there waiting for me with my parents and Julie. Julie then ran over to me calling me a thief and demanded her ring. Apparently Julie found out that mom gave me the ring and assumed that I lied about just borrowing it. My parents tried to calm her down but when I wouldn't pick up (bad cell reception at the hospital/phone died) Laura called the police. I handed Julie the ring right then and there and told my family about Laura before walking into my apartment.\n\nI also saw that Julie had trashed me all over social media but almost everyone was apologetic when I and Laura's sister explained everything. Julie took down her posts but never apologized. I proposed to Laura once she had recovered, she said \"yes\" and we're preparing for the wedding. Laura asked my other sister \"Annie\" (21f) to be a bridesmaid and when Julie asked if she was going to be one Laura and I informed her that she wasn't invited. Julie is calling me bitter and that I had no reason to still be angry with her. My parents think I'm being too harsh by not at least inviting her but I'm still angry. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Because I keep seeing this in the comments or in the DMs\n\n1. Julie took down the post(s) the following day she got the ring back.\n2. Julie thinks that I made myself look guilty by not responding to the multiple calls and texts that I received before the called the police.\n3. I'm not sure what Julie said or did to convince the police to come with her but all I know is that she was trying to report a theft.\n4. My parents didn't arrive with Julie or the police, they showed up after and was arguing with her with I arrived.\n5. My parents were on my side about being upset with Julie but feels that since it was a year since the mistake/misunderstanding that it was time to let things go. \n6. Julie has read a lot of stories on Reddit about sibling stealing each others possessions and I think that it got to her when it came to the ring.\n7. My mom told Julie I borrowed the ring when Julie stopped by to borrow it for an event.

If Julie can't apologize after *breaking the law filing a false report* then I can't blame OP for wanting nothing to do with her.", "I came to say the same thing, mum hasn\u2019t died yet so Julie it\u2019s NOT your ring. I personally wouldn\u2019t forgive her either, especially as she never even apologised or seemed to care that the fianc\u00e9 was in hospital.\n\nNTA", "I was thinking the exact same thing. OP is NTA. His sister certainly is for wasting valuable police resources on something like that.", "and how do we know julie wont  try to accuse op of being a thief or one upping the bride or some other disruptive manner", "Exactly. Unless she filed a false police report, as she is not the owner, she had no right to file the report. It would require OP's mom to file the report. So either the sister committed a crime and lied to the police that the ring was hers, or the mom lied about filing a police report and threw the sister under the bus after the truth came out", "*EXACTLY* Which is why, I doubt the veracity of this story.", "Julie doesn't want to apologize because she'll have to admit she's an asshole.  I know folks like this.  They think if they just avoid the issue and pretend it didn't happen, it's forgotten.  But it's not.  It just gets worse.", "Yeah, that\u2019s true. If sister doesn\u2019t apologize, OP can either include or exclude her. If he excludes her, she probably won\u2019t apologize afterwards or invite her to her wedding", "True. Which is what OP is making very clear here. He doesn\u2019t want his sister in his life. Most of his family will probably pick his side.", "Mom can deny Julie the ring, she\u2019s not obligated to give it to her.", "Yeah, this was my thought too. It was good until the cops showed up and stuck around.", "Why would OP even wanna go to *her* wedding at this point?", "It's been a year already, she'll never apologise.", "So what you\u2019re trying to say here is that your sister, who is not the owner of the ring, had multiple police officers and your parents go to your home and wait(I\u2019m assuming ) til you got home to confront you about this ring, that she still isn\u2019t the owner of, even though your parents, the real owners of the ring, who were there with the cops said it wasn\u2019t stolen. Is that what you\u2019re saying? If so that doesn\u2019t sound believable in the slightest.", "OP do you live in a small town?", "Is your sister Smeagle?", "NTA a few things, \n1) the ring was your mums to decide what to do with, she wasn\u2019t giving you the ring she was letting you borrow it. Ownership of the ring is still with your mum.\n2) she posted all over social media putting you down as a thief and the only thing she did was delete the post after she got proof. \n3) somethings cannot be forgiven and unless she is willing to actually be sorry then nothing more can be done.", "Maybe show Julie this post. You are NTA.", "[removed]", "NTA Your sister assumed you stole her ring because you.... didn't pick up the phone? Where is the logic here. She knows where you live, did she think you would have fled the country for a dumb ring?\n\nShe was being extremely unreasonable and escalated a situation that didn't need to be escalated, meanwhile her sister was going through hell and fearing for her girlfriend.\n\n\"It's been a year.\" Has she done anything in that year to make up for it? She hasn't even apologized and you are suppose to just forgive her?\n\nTell your parents it's your wedding, she accused you of being a thief unprompted and added to one of the worst days in your life because she didn't trust you. \n\nTell your sister if she gets anywhere near your wedding it's *you* who will call the cops on her. :)", "NTA. She was told where the ring was BEFORE she called the cops. And it's not her ring yet. \nHas Julie apologized to you yet? How is calling the police over a ring a mistake/misunderstanding when she was informed of the rings whereabouts?\nIf she is allowed at the wedding, is she going to make sure everyone knows she thought you stole the ring when they compliment Laura's ring?", "NTA. Its your wedding, you get to pick who comes. And who doesnt. It would be wonderful if the incident could be put in the past. If there were a way for Julie to make up for what she did that would let you move past and start healing everyone would benefit. But as others have said what she did needs a full throated apology, much more than just taking down the offending posts. Good luck and congratulations on your wedding!", "I wouldn't be surprised if she is actually jealous that you are copying the ring and that is the root of it.", "NTA \n\nIt doesn't sound like Julie has ever done anything to make amends. Not to mention, she wasn't even the owner of the ring and had no right to report a theft. This is called the consequences for being an AH.", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA!!", "NTA She hasn't owned up to being in the wrong, she hasn't tried to make amends (taking down the post is not enough), she hasn't even apologized. Fuck her, you have no sister.", "NTA...be careful with your mom, I suspect she was more involved than she is letting on.", "NTA Julie was out of line. But as a side note if I was Julie I\u2019d be really upset you were copying the ring for Laura. She probably views this as something special just between her, mother, great grandmother and is not happy you are copying the ring. Her reaction was inappropriate, over the top and a waste of police time, but you definitely should have asked Julie what she thought about you copying the ring for Laura.", "INFO: Has any determined it Sister was going to sell the ring?", "Nta tell her her immaturity and hotheadedness is the reason she is not invited", "Also the fact the sister doesn't even own the ring, her and OP's mum own the ring and she has the audacity to call the cops on OP. Like yes it's a tradition to pass it down on the oldest female, but thing is they can change, mum could have been like actually I want my son to have it.\n\nNTA - sister is an entitled brat, I wouldn't invite her either if she was mine after a stunt like that. \n\nAlso slightly off topic if I was your parents I would look at this incident, and plan for the future, by updating the will to specify exactly who is getting what when they pass. As could be very nasty.", "Also no apologies or posting publicly it was a mistake.  No theft happened.  When a family member makes those types of accusations publicly it has wait that lasts years.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

If it is very unique and the sister loves attention it's a possibility. Even so cop cars and possible arrest records and court costs is extreme lengths to go to in order to keep unique to herself. Huge jerk move towards a family member that didn't do anything wrong.\n\nIt'd take a real conversation to find out.", "And the ring wasn't even hers! The audacity.", "And she went from suspicious to calling the police and smearing her brother's name in no time.  She didn't listen to her parents.  She took a day of not reaching somebody on a cell phone as proof of guilt, when we've all been hard to reach for a day or a day or two due to technical glitches.  I would never trust anyone who had so little trust in me.  Family means good jewelry to her, not good relationships.", "100% spot in the impact lasts a very long time", "Yeah, I\u2019m confused that they entertained this as the ring wasn\u2019t hers yet.
