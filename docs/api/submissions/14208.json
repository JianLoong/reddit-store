Mark has been living with Evan for the past 4 years after finishing school and they've been splitting the rent because they couldn't afford a place on their own. However, Evan recently started a new job, is now making better money and has let his brother know that he will not be renewing the lease and will be moving to another place. However, Mark would like to stay in the current place, yet, he cannot afford the rent on his own. He at first researched for a roommate but decided that he would not feel comfortable living with a stranger and he does not want to downgrade. \n\nSo recently, he came to me and asked me to fulfill the portion of the rent that his brother used to pay so he could keep the place. I, however, have refused because there's room at home for him and I told him that he could just move back in with me and his father if he really needed a place to stay. He doesn't want to move back in with us, however, he says \"It's embarrassing to live with your parents\". I told him that it's really not and that's it's only embarrassing if you're a 40-year-old loser who does nothing but play video games in their mom's basement all and yells at her she accidentally puts *lite* mayo on their sandwich instead of *regular* mayo.\n\nHe disagrees strongly. It's not that I can't afford it, I can, but I really see no reason for it. If he moves back in with us we're not charging him rent or anything, he's not going to have to chip in for bills or anything. It's not like he's lifestyle's going to change that much either. I mean, maybe he won't be allowed to walk around nekked eating ice cream anymore but nothing really significant is gonna change. He's an adult, we're not gonna give his ass an 11 o'clock curfew, he can come and go as he pleases. Literally he's just going to be a roommate who happens to be our son (I guess).\n\nIt just feels like a waste of money for both of us. He can save money by living with us and we can save more money by not spending it on his apartment. And I'm not doing this to force him to move back in, I just let him know that it is an option for him if he chooses to take it. However, he's really angry with me and is now not responding to my texts or calls. Well, I mean he is responding to my texts, but only with \"We'll talk when you decide that helping your son keep his apartment is not a waste of money\". He's also recruited my parents and now their hounding me too about \"not supporting my son\" but I'm literally offering him some support!

That\u2019s a solid down payment on a home for a 26 y/o he\u2019s just too young to realize it.

Good for you for standing your ground. When I graduated college there was an ungodly amount of kids who were having their lifestyles completely subsidized by their parents. \n\nI\u2019m nearing 30 now and it\u2019s still the case. People\u2019s parents are keeping them afloat. I think it teaches the children that they don\u2019t ever have to take full accountability for their lives because their parents will be their to bail them out financially. \n\nI agree with you, let him move home. It\u2019s a good incentive to work hard to get out or proactively search for a potential roommate he can forge a relationship with while living at home before signing a lease.", "NTA\n\nI gt that he doesn't want to live with parents but there is no reason for you to pay for his whims. He can find a second job or a cheaper apartament, his choice. Also\n\n>he says \"It's embarrassing to live with your parents\"\n\nBut taking money from his parents is not embarrassing? He has to grow up and this is a good opportunity to do so.", "NTA Your son needs to grow up and realize that he can't have everything he wants in life. You're refusing to waste your money on an apartment he can't afford and offering him a much better deal. But if he doesn't want to accept it then he'll have to figure things out on his own.", "NTA \n\nYou are right in saying that paying part of the rent for your son\u2019s apartment is a waste of your money.\n\nIf he can\u2019t afford the rent on his own, tough luck!

And other son also wants the same and equal percentage of rent support?", "NTA. Well done", "NTA. If he can't afford the price of his apartment, he needs to downgrade, get a roommate, or get a second job. You did a good thing by refusing to pay. He has to learn that he can't always rely on mom and dad to save him when stuff like this happens. \n\n Honestly there's no shame in coming back to live with your parents, especially now since everything is getting expensive.

As a parent you are doing the right thing by helping him see that.", "NTA\n\n To send you texts like that is outrageous and downright bratty. Sorry your son is an entitled AH at the moment who doesn't realize how lucky he is to have your offer as an option.", "It is equally embarrassing having mommy and daddy foot the bills. You are doing him a favor by giving him the option to come back - he needs to grow up and with your offer at least he has security if he really can\u2019t find a way.", "NTA. Your son is entitled. You owe him nothing and let your parents know if they want to spend their money to support him then they can.  Your son wants to make grown up decisions so he can pay grown up bills. Don\u2019t let him emotionally blackmail you. The apparent maybe has a 1 bedroom he can downsize to. Why does he need a 2 bedroom apartment????????\n\nIf you end up breaking down and giving him money for rent please remember at the end of life to calculate that in and give that much more to his brother along with an increase due to interest as it is not fair to favor one child over the other.", "He wants to be independent while depending on his mother financially. That's the definition of a poser, not an independent adult.\n\nIf he wants to keep the place, he needs to do what most young people who want to live independently do...suck it up and find a roommate to share the costs. You've given him an alternative and a good one at that. He can't pose at your expense.", "Nta. Time for son to adult up and live within his means. He has plenty of choices, move somewhere smaller and cheaper, get a room mate, move in with you or move in with someone else in a different apartment. These are all reasonable compromised any other person would make, but for some reason, Mark thinks he's entitled to additional financial support. Have you asked him how that's fair to his brother, who isn't receiving financial support?", "So he wants to be independent\u2026 while being financially dependent on you\u2026. NTA OP. If he wants to be an adult then he has to make his own decisions.", "NTA...... it is a waste of your money, he doesn't care about wasting your money. Tell everyone that if they are so concerned about yoi not paying his rent, that you won't stop them from paying it.", "NTA for not wanting to subsidize his appartment, but I don't think you should let him move in with you either. He is an adult who needs to make his own arrangement for how he lives.", "If I had told my mother than she needed to pay half my rent when I was 25, she would have taken me to the ER because she would have thought I'd had a stroke.  There's no excuse for that much entitlement.  Good grief.  I'd withdraw the offer to let him live with you for free, too.  Let him find an apartment he can afford by himself.  He needs a little brush with reality.", "NTA. Nope he wants independence, he needs a roommate.", "NTA. If he doesn't want to live with you or have a roommate, the only option for him is to downsize. I get why he wouldn't want to live with his parents, aside from being embarrassing, but it's almost as embarrassing to have his parents pay half his rent.", "NTA\n\nTell him it\u2019s more embarrassing to have his parents funding his rent. \n\nHe is looking for a hand out, not a hand up. \n\nYou are willing to give him a hand up by letting him live rent free with you, so that he can save and put himself in a better position. \n\nDon\u2019t give him a hand out. 1) he won\u2019t actually grow. 2) it\u2019s unfair on his brother. 3) it\u2019s unfair on you.\n\nHe can move home or downsize. He is being entitled.", "NTA, you are offering help and support. it's just not her preferred support, but beggars can't be choosers. He should just be happy he has parents caring enough to let him move back rent free so he can save his money.\n\nThe only thing that really changes living with your parents is that dating is little harder, but not impossible. I mean I met my gf after a rough patch in my life when I had to move back with my parents for a period of time before moving out again.", "NTA he is an adult and he has choices to make. \n\nHe can get a roommate, he can get a cheaper apartment, he can move back in with you.\n\nI'm not sure why he thinks guilt mom into paying my rent is one of those choices, but it isn't.\n\nBroken record technique with him.", "100% NTA\n\nHe can:\n\n1.

Why should you throw your money away to subsidise him!?", "NTA - Wow, when did your son become so entitled to your money.  He obviously hasn't grown up if he's still acting this way.\n\nHe either gets a roommate, another part-time job or like you suggest, moves home and saves money up to afford an apartment.", "Or get a flatmate \n\nCome on I'm sure he can find someone.   \n\nHe is just being entitled and childish by wanting it all his own way.", "Let\u2019s be real. Mom is missing the point. It\u2019s embarrassing to people he wants to date. But if he wants to be an adult and have that autonomy, he has to pay for it.

NTA, you are right, you have offered support and he doesn't want it.", "He has lots of options. He can rent a smaller place, get a roommate, get a second job, or take you up on your generous offer. Embarrassing is thinking your parents still need to take care of you at that age. NTA.", "NTA at all. Plain and simple, he can't afford to live where he wants to live.\n\nIMO, your only mistake would be not charging him for anything if he lives with you.", "NTA. You have offered reasonable and sensible solutions to help him and he\u2019s throwing a hissy fit because you won\u2019t help him the way he wants you to. Plenty of 25 year olds live with their parents, especially these days.
