Let them know that you have not authorized anybody else to pick up this medication for you.\n\nDepending on what sort of doctors you are going to they might have their own website 'portal' basically patients make online accounts and can check appointments/medications/refills etc. In the future pick a pharmacy and ask your doctor to please 'call in the prescription' they can fax/call vs giving you sheets of paper to save for each refill.", "NTA.  But there is no such thing as being an \"on and off\" alcoholic.  Your father is an alcoholic who has relapsed.  He in no way, shape, or form sbpuld be taking  your prescribed opioid medication.", "NTA. The entitlement and selfishness from your dad is unreal.", "NTA at all. \n\nI have endometriosis aswell and I know first hand how difficult it can be to handle the pain, even while using your prescribed medication. You shouldn't be pressured to give it to him because YOU NEED IT.\n\nIf he truly needed opioids, he would get a prescription himself. Regarding his background of substance abuse, I doubt any sane doctor would do this anyways.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind: depending on where you live, it might even be illegal for you to give him your opioids. You could get into trouble.", "Nta. Was it liquid morphine aka oromorph? It doesn't really work for most headaches anyway.", "That addictive behavior. Even his excuses sound like an addict. \n\nHe\u2019s got a problem. Hide all opioids.", "NTA. Get a lockbox to keep your meds in so he can't take them without your knowledge and consent.", "NTA: Your dad is an addict. Xanax is also addictive. So are opiates. His behavior of only wanting addictive substances for headaches and sleep shows he\u2019s not really sober. He\u2019s just substituting other drugs for alcohol. He\u2019s being manipulative to you to obtain your medication. I would strongly suggest you look into Al-Anon or therapy. You need to set boundaries and not enable him to take your medications. You caved once, so now he will keep asking. I do think a lock box is the best idea. I doubt he\u2019d above stealing from you. But you need to disentangle yourself from his addict behaviors. I know about this as I work as a drug and alcohol detox nurse. I have compassion for people with addiction, but I also have boundaries. Enabling your father only harms you.", "You will not get that prescription anymore if anyone finds out you\u2019re letting your father take it. Hide you meds.", "NTA\n\nGatekeeping?  In cases of medication, YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD.  Medicines are a combination of chemicals that are prescribed by medical professionals who understand their effects on their patients.  What might be ok for one could be catastrophic for another.  Also, opioids are dangerous if used improperly.  \n\nTaking someone's medicine is illegal, as others pointed out.  And this addict could make you run out before you're scheduled to refill; then you will be stuck in pain until then (and no, doctors do not allow early refills or bend the rules)\n\nHide the medicine.  Lockbox with key on your person at all times and hide said box somewhere secure.", "NTA\n\nget a safe and lock up your meds or you won't have any when you need it and if the authorities find out you're just giving them away they won't give them to you anymore and might even charge you with a crime. You pops is a druggie, don't ever give him anything again!!\n\nhave you asked your doctor about birth control at all? I too have the same condition and even though its mild it was still absolutely horrible and strong opioids didn't work well for me but birth control has been fantastic, complete 180 for me, now a couple midol and heating pad and I'm good to go. the one I take is called Enskyce, ask your dr. about it", "TAKING \ud83d\udc4f ANOTHER \ud83d\udc4f PERSON'S \ud83d\udc4f PRESCRIPTION \ud83d\udc4f DRUGS \ud83d\udc4f IS \ud83d\udc4f ILLEGAL\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nThe audacity of some people.

Also, keep working with your doctors. I, too, have severe endo, but the right combination of hormones have stopped 98% of my pain without opioids. Any breakthrough pain is gone with Advil.", "Yeah, you're gonna have to call your pharmacist on that. Your father knows exactly what he's doing, and it's addict shit not health shit. NTA", "Are pill safes a thing? I've never heard of them, but it feels like it must be a thing.", "Beyond hiding them I\u2019m going to suggest getting a lock box and keeping the key on you at all times and don\u2019t tell him about the lock box/let him see it when you open it. This sounds like it is more than him needing a stronger medication for headaches, like possible addiction.\n\nYou need that medication for yourself, if his headaches are so severe then he needs to see a doctor about getting prescribed something to help. I\u2019m sorry you are being put in this position, you deserve better. It worries me that he gave you Xanax as a child, I would not be able to trust his judgment.", "Are you in the US?  It is illegal for you to allow your father to take your opioid meds. If you run out early your doctor will not refill your meds early, so you will be without them for however many days equal to the amount your dad took.  Also, what do you think would happen IF he were to have an allergic reaction to them and dies? You could possibly be held responsible since you knew it was wrong to allow him to take them. You need to buy a lock box and keep them locked up.  Offer to make your dad a doctor's appointment to be evaluated for migraines, but never give him your medicine.", "Please do, and you can even get a small safe if you need to. But letting him have access to your meds is BAD NEWS. I'm a chronic pain patient as well as a pharmacy technician so I see this issue from both sides. Evem if you're not caught, youll still run out of meds too soon and you won't have them when you meed them. If found out, best case scenario is that your doctor no longer trusts you and stops giving you the meds that work, worse case is big-time legal trouble. For YOU.\n\nBesides, headaches don't even really respond to opioids. The real issue is that your dad has a substance abuse problem (not a past one, a very current and active one!) and is just looking for a hit. If he truly wanted relief from headaches I can think of several OTC meds that work much better than any narcotic, or he'd see his own doctor.\n\nPLEASE lock up your meds.", "OP, Call your doctor's office and tell them that the paper prescription has been misplaced and you are worried about possible theft. Have them cancel it and reissue with a new prescription (electronic if possible directly to the filling oharmacy). Once this happens let the pharmacy know that NO ONE BUT YOU PERSONALLY is authorized to pick up the Rx, using the same explanation if needed.\n\nGet a small lockbox and strong combination lock and keep your meds under lock and key at all times. When (not if) he pressures you to supply him tell him you are out. Do not take meds in his presence if possible.", "I'm a pharmacy tech and have 25+ years' experience working in doctors' offices. I'd advise you to consider that rx gone. Here's what you do... call your doctor's office, tell them that your father has a problem and has taken your prescription so they can put out an alert to nearby pharmacies to be on the lookout for a man trying to fill someone else's narcotic rx and to alert them if he comes to their pharmacy. And most importantly, have them send your control prescriptions directly - electronically - to your pharmacy from here on out (I'd even get a new pharmacy and not tell your dad where you're filling your rx's anymore). This will be an unusual situation for them, but I promise you won't be the first patient of theirs with a problematic family member who has made this request.", "Your mother is very wrong. Addiction is psychological (you can be addicted without being physically dependent and vice versa) and your dad is already am addict in the throes of active addiction. He doesn't have to drink every day to be in active alcoholism. He's using your meds to supplement his alcohol addiction - theres no question he is already an addict", "That attitude is going to get him seriously hurt one day. There are so many reasons not to take your opiates for his headaches, as others have mentioned (it\u2019s illegal, it\u2019s dangerous, they\u2019re addictive, he could literally stop breathing and die if he chooses to drink after taking them, you could be in legal jeopardy, etc). But also if he uses it regularly for those headaches, his headaches will worsen. Opiates and analgesics are known to cause worsening headaches over time as rebound headaches. Doubtful that information will stop him, but maybe hurting himself will be more reason. \n\nNot sure what state you are in, but many are moving to mandatory electronic prescribing of these substances and Dr offices are gaining the technology to do so. Ask your doctor if he can e-scribe it to your pharmacy instead of paper scripts, reduce his access.", "I just posted this exact advice above \ud83d\ude01 Just wanted to add, as a pain patient, a former dr's office employee for 25+ years, and a current pharmacy tech, its a VERY BAD IDEA to lie in this situation, no matter how harmless it seems. OP can explain that they have a family member with a history of substance abuse, that they live with, so they need their meds sent directly to the pharmacy and that nobody but them is to pick them up. The dr's office and pharmacy have seen this before and honesty is always best in these situations. Better to be the transparent truthful patient than to lie and risk being caught out and losing that trust.", "Oh also if he takes his Xanax with them, it can reduce his respiratory drive and also\u2026 kill him. What he is doing is extremely unsafe.", "Look into section 8 housing. It will cover college housing costs as well.", "Yikes, 12 boxes of what??? Do you mean refills? You can't write refills for narcotics in the US, and 12 boxes of anything in 1 prescription is a HUGE amount. I'm just curious, not really my business, but that's a lot of medication for your father to be withholding from you. I strongly suspect that prescription is already gone. You really need to report this to your doctor or you could possibly get in a lot of trouble if he's already gotten the rx and taken it all."]}
