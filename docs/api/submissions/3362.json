That's a pretty common one, but the reality is that if those issues never get taken seriously, they'll never go away. \n\nBased on what you said, your dad has addiction issues that it sounds like he hasn't addressed or been honest with himself about. (I'm a social worker, working in addiction and mental health). You can't make your dad realize this, but there are groups for family members of ppl with addiction (probably through AA but ask your gp) that can be really helpful for YOU and helping you to understand the ways in which your loved one and their addiction impact YOU. \n\nFor example, he is allowing you to think you are the AH for not letting him abuse your prescription. Im not judging your dad or saying he's a bad guy, but addiction makes people pretty selfish, even if they don't realize it or intend to be. Good people can also experience addiction. It's not \"normal\" for your loved ones to steal your opiates, you don't have to accept that dishonest behavior or internalize your own (really fair) boundaries as you being the AH. \n\nYou can't control your dad, but it sounds like you are setting really healthy basic boundaries and he is manipulating your emotions to make you feel guilty, when it's HIS behavior that is innapropriate.", "I'm willing to hold on to them for you, OP.

When they say these things take a moment and try to look at the big picture and set boundaries, always remember that as much as you love your Dad; he's an addict.  Its an awful disease and it doesn't make him a bad person BUT it does make him an unreliable person.  Since you're in college now consider seeing one of the counselors - you sound like you've got a good head on your shoulders but it must have been difficult growing up with an alcoholic Dad, having a professional help you sort through all the excuses and gaslighting will really help You when it comes to future relationships, and how to deal with your folks.\n\nBe stealthy and get your paper prescription asap.

Basically 'you are an alcoholic who needs treatment' / 'No, Mr.OP Xanax is NOT a drug for headaches I will not write you a prescription\" \n\nYou got your prescription because a DOCTORS ran tests, diagnosed your medical problems and wrote an appropriate prescription for You.  If your Dad doesn't believe in doctors and science he can go to CVS and pickup some OTCs like all the other non-doctors out there.  If he genuinely gets headaches (and he's not just making this up for sympathy and an excuse to take drugs) there are other medications out there that would work better - Aspirin would work better for a real headache, also alcohol is only going to make his head feel worse.", "I take opioids in pill form!

I doubt he\u2019s bought them for himself, but I\u2019m finding it odd that he still hasn\u2019t brought it to me. I\u2019ll put my foot down tomorrow (after he\u2019s calmed down).", "Get the prescription for yourself and fill it yourself. I'd tell your doctor about this situation asap!!!", "\"prescription letter\"? Are you talking about a letter that states that you are under a doctor's care and are prescribed opioids or are you referring to a physical prescription that you take to your pharmacy to show them what you doctor prescribed so they give you the medicine?\n\nIf it is an actual prescription he may no longer have it. He may have filled it and taken the medicine himself. If so he will likely get very angry and defensive to hide that. \n\nI am worried for you. If you are a child who is dependent on your parents, you will likely have to involve responsible adults to keep you safe and make sure your needs are met. Addiction is powerful and can override good intentions."]}
