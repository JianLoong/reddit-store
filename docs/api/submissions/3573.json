Our relationship is pretty normal and there\u2019s no reason to think we will break up. We have the exact same salaries as we work the same job and we split bills  and necessities equally but do have separate bank accounts. It recently occurred to me that I\u2019ve been putting a lot of money into the house which will end up solely in his name and I mentioned to him that while I believe our relationship will stand the test of time,  it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable that if we did decide to end things, he would own the house and I would own nothing. He laughed and said I was being ridiculous and said he wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk about it. I waited a few days and brought it up again. He was downright annoyed with me this time and said I was being greedy and acted like I was trying to take his house from him. (He didn\u2019t call it \u201chis\u201d but that was how I read it). I told him I wouldn\u2019t put anymore money into it until we figured out how to make it a secure investment for me too and then I dropped it because it was getting a bit heated and he clearly thought I was being selfish.
