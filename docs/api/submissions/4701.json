Ben was already annoyed in the beginning of the day, he made a few hurtful comments and acted annoyed anytime I talked.\n\nOnce we got home, I began to make dinner for everyone. Towards the end when the food was almost ready to plate, I asked Ben for some help. To which he rolled his eyes, gave a dramatic sigh, and got up to help. While grabbing something from the cabinet, I stood up too fast and hit my head very hard on the counter. Tears immediately started forming in my eyes and Ben just glared at me and said \u201cThat was gods way of telling you to just stop arguing, you deserved that\u201d. I instantly began crying and he tried to hush me so his parents wouldn\u2019t hear.\n\nI finished dinner, and went to set the plates on the table but he stopped me \nand told me we had to take everything off (place mats, decorations, table runner). This was not something we normally did and when I told him no, he immediately got defensive and told me that his parents would think I was disgusting if I didn\u2019t because we had cats who \u201cget their shitty paws all over it every day\u201d. \n\nOur cats are very clean and get bathed twice weekly (due to skin conditions) so I never thought of them being an issue to anyone. His parents also loved cuddling them the whole day so I was very taken aback. He continued to tell me how disgusting I was for wanting to let his parents eat at the same table our cats walked on, so I excused myself to the bathroom and immediately started crying. \n\nA few moments later, he came in to tell me all the reasons he was pissed off at me that day, but in a very twisted version. For example: Me asking for the baby back so I could breastfeed meant that I didn\u2019t want to \u201clet\u201d him be a father and I never let him hold his child. He continued to tell me everything that was wrong with me, and that I needed to stop \u201carguing\u201d with him and just stop talking. \n\nThis continued for a few minutes, at which point I entirely shut down and agreed with everything he said. He then got upset at me agreeing with him because now it seemed like I didn\u2019t care. He told me that me crying in the bathroom was making the weekend all about me instead of about his parents.\nHe left, and I spent the rest of the night in my room, he came and apologized a few hours later.\nHe told me his parents gave him a good talk and he will be better. But now 2 days later I feel as though our relationship is entirely over. He is the father of my child, but I know this won\u2019t change and I deserve to be treated better.\n\nSo am i the asshole?", "created_utc": 1671009205, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlmcj7/aita_for_excusing_myself_from_dinner_with_my/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that you are on here wondering if all this mess is your fault -- that is breaking my heart.\n\nSweetie, Ben behaved abominably to you, continuously, and with intent. He was insecure and stressed out, for whatever reason, and took it out by being hateful to you. He only apologized when HIS PARENTS reamed him out for his behaviour.\n\nIt doesn't sound like he's proud of you at all, even though you just gave him a beautiful child (amirite? beautiful, hey?) And that is just devastating.\n\nHe's lucky that it was HIS parents visiting and not YOUR family, or he'd already be living solo. I don't know what kind of monster could leave you and baby alone with him in that kind of environment.\n\nNormally when folks have a new baby together, I default to \"Go get some counselling before you decide to leave\". Here, I am reversing policy: OP honey, LEAVE as soon as you safely can, and only return if counselling convinces you that Ben can change. YES you deserve to be treated better than this, by a country mile.\n\nNTA honey. Also, if your head keeps hurting, or you have double vision or nausea from that head impact, go see a doctor, okay?

He is trying to control you by making you have low self esteem.", "NTA , he won\u2019t be better, he\u2019s an abuser.", "NTA and I hope you can go and stay somewhere else with the baby. Your fiance is abusive and gaslighting and just a plain old arsehole. It\u2019s good that you recognise that the relationship is over and that you deserve better. You most definitely do deserve better, especially after having a baby so recently. I hope you can make a quick escape and you never again get stuck with someone who makes you cry. Best of luck.", "Nta. I seriously don\u2019t call that a rocky relationship. He\u2019s abusive and he knows it. Which is why he tried to keep you quiet so his parents couldn\u2019t hear you.

This guy is an asshole with red flags. \n\nDo you want your child to grow up watching their father treat his mother as less than? They'll either learn to emulate him or that it's normal to be treated that way, or they'll resent the both of you. Either way, you're not setting yourself or your child up for success. \n\nEvaluate what is you want for yourself and your baby. \n\nIf you really want to stick it out, try couples therapy, but if he's this much of a dick and says no, he's basically giving you your answer on the chances of success for the relationship. You're both young, so it's likely he hasn't matured enough to have that self-awareness that he's just not a good person. He needs a good kick up the ass and a wake up call. \n\nI would not want a father who would treat my mum like this.", "Absolutely NTA. Ben is abusive and you need to get out before he becomes physically abusive. Babies don\u2019t get easier to raise when they\u2019re older, and you want your baby to be raised in a loving environment.
