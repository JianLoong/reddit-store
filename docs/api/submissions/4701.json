Ben was already annoyed in the beginning of the day, he made a few hurtful comments and acted annoyed anytime I talked.\n\nOnce we got home, I began to make dinner for everyone. Towards the end when the food was almost ready to plate, I asked Ben for some help. To which he rolled his eyes, gave a dramatic sigh, and got up to help. While grabbing something from the cabinet, I stood up too fast and hit my head very hard on the counter. Tears immediately started forming in my eyes and Ben just glared at me and said \u201cThat was gods way of telling you to just stop arguing, you deserved that\u201d. I instantly began crying and he tried to hush me so his parents wouldn\u2019t hear.\n\nI finished dinner, and went to set the plates on the table but he stopped me \nand told me we had to take everything off (place mats, decorations, table runner). This was not something we normally did and when I told him no, he immediately got defensive and told me that his parents would think I was disgusting if I didn\u2019t because we had cats who \u201cget their shitty paws all over it every day\u201d. \n\nOur cats are very clean and get bathed twice weekly (due to skin conditions) so I never thought of them being an issue to anyone. His parents also loved cuddling them the whole day so I was very taken aback. He continued to tell me how disgusting I was for wanting to let his parents eat at the same table our cats walked on, so I excused myself to the bathroom and immediately started crying. \n\nA few moments later, he came in to tell me all the reasons he was pissed off at me that day, but in a very twisted version. For example: Me asking for the baby back so I could breastfeed meant that I didn\u2019t want to \u201clet\u201d him be a father and I never let him hold his child. He continued to tell me everything that was wrong with me, and that I needed to stop \u201carguing\u201d with him and just stop talking. \n\nThis continued for a few minutes, at which point I entirely shut down and agreed with everything he said. He then got upset at me agreeing with him because now it seemed like I didn\u2019t care. He told me that me crying in the bathroom was making the weekend all about me instead of about his parents.\nHe left, and I spent the rest of the night in my room, he came and apologized a few hours later.\nHe told me his parents gave him a good talk and he will be better. But now 2 days later I feel as though our relationship is entirely over. He is the father of my child, but I know this won\u2019t change and I deserve to be treated better.\n\nSo am i the asshole?", "created_utc": 1671009205, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlmcj7/aita_for_excusing_myself_from_dinner_with_my/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that you are on here wondering if all this mess is your fault -- that is breaking my heart.\n\nSweetie, Ben behaved abominably to you, continuously, and with intent. He was insecure and stressed out, for whatever reason, and took it out by being hateful to you. He only apologized when HIS PARENTS reamed him out for his behaviour.\n\nIt doesn't sound like he's proud of you at all, even though you just gave him a beautiful child (amirite? beautiful, hey?) And that is just devastating.\n\nHe's lucky that it was HIS parents visiting and not YOUR family, or he'd already be living solo. I don't know what kind of monster could leave you and baby alone with him in that kind of environment.\n\nNormally when folks have a new baby together, I default to \"Go get some counselling before you decide to leave\". Here, I am reversing policy: OP honey, LEAVE as soon as you safely can, and only return if counselling convinces you that Ben can change. YES you deserve to be treated better than this, by a country mile.\n\nNTA honey. Also, if your head keeps hurting, or you have double vision or nausea from that head impact, go see a doctor, okay? Keeping my fingers crossed for you.", "NTA you need to get out of this abusive relationship.  He is trying to control you by making you have low self esteem.", "NTA , he won\u2019t be better, he\u2019s an abuser.", "NTA and I hope you can go and stay somewhere else with the baby. Your fiance is abusive and gaslighting and just a plain old arsehole. It\u2019s good that you recognise that the relationship is over and that you deserve better. You most definitely do deserve better, especially after having a baby so recently. I hope you can make a quick escape and you never again get stuck with someone who makes you cry. Best of luck.", "Nta. I seriously don\u2019t call that a rocky relationship. He\u2019s abusive and he knows it. Which is why he tried to keep you quiet so his parents couldn\u2019t hear you. You need to leave asap. If not for yourself at least for your child.", "NTA.\n\nI think you know what everyone is going to suggest. This guy is an asshole with red flags. \n\nDo you want your child to grow up watching their father treat his mother as less than? They'll either learn to emulate him or that it's normal to be treated that way, or they'll resent the both of you. Either way, you're not setting yourself or your child up for success. \n\nEvaluate what is you want for yourself and your baby. \n\nIf you really want to stick it out, try couples therapy, but if he's this much of a dick and says no, he's basically giving you your answer on the chances of success for the relationship. You're both young, so it's likely he hasn't matured enough to have that self-awareness that he's just not a good person. He needs a good kick up the ass and a wake up call. \n\nI would not want a father who would treat my mum like this.", "Absolutely NTA. Ben is abusive and you need to get out before he becomes physically abusive. Babies don\u2019t get easier to raise when they\u2019re older, and you want your baby to be raised in a loving environment. Please get yourself in a safe, supportive place and then work on getting yourself  in a good mental space. My heart breaks for you that you\u2019d even question if you\u2019re the AH in this situation, and shows me that you need to learn how to self love.", "Nta and unless you want to be torn down and insulted and treated like crap for the rest of your life dont marry this man. There is no relationship here. There is a man who uses you as a verbal punching bag and then berates you for reacting to it. Is this really the future you want for you and your son?", "Simply put, NTA, Ben is.\n\nIn any case, feelings are something that you cannot decide, and control not a real option, so in any case one could be considered an AH for them.\n\nIf someone's actions hurt you so that you end up crying, I'd safely assume that the problem comes from the one that triggered it by behaving irrespectfully", "Hon you\u2019re not an AH. Clearly not. Please post on r/relationship_advice for better help", "Info: why is he your fianc\u00e9", "NTA for reconsidering your relationship with someone who is that toxic. Do what you can that protects your child and you. \n\n\nIf you cannot imagine yourself having any days where he's not being toxic, that's your sign that you should move on from him and do better for you and your childs wellbeing.", "Please be careful and pay attention to how you feel. Dizziness, lightheaded, and nausea can be a sign of a worse injury to your head like a concussion. If the pain doesn\u2019t go away soon or you start to feel any of these things, please talk to a doctor to make sure you\u2019re ok. \n\nHoney, this is a million red flags in one small story. This is such an abusive relationship and it\u2019s only going to escalate. You are so right. You do deserve better and the relationship should be over. Please, do what you can to prepare yourself and leave. Try to leave on the best terms you can for the sake of your child, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have much control over that with his temper. Please please get out as soon as you can. This is not a good situation for you to be in. Don\u2019t blame yourself please please please. You did absolutely nothing wrong. NTA x1000000 Please get help and get out.", "NTA. You absolutely deserve better than this. Leave and enjoy your life", "NTA do not marry this person. He won\u2019t get better because his parents talked to him. Get out, get a lawyer for child custody agreement. You and child deserve better.", "NTA. But please RUN for your mental well being. He needs help or therapy. Don't go back to him until he gets help and proves he changed. Think of yourself and the baby. The baby deserves better than him.", "NTA - Ben sounds like a narcissist. However, I do agree with the wiping down the table; I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t let someone stand on your table and then eat from it w/o cleaning it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
