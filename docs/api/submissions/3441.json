We supported each other in the process of both of us becoming single moms when our exes turned out to be not good partners.\n\nI recently moved back to our hometown and Nikki excitedly set up a playdate between her boy 'Mike'  (5) and mine 'Dean' (4). The first playdate was rocky, Mike had numerous tantrums including throwing toys and sand at Dean or trying to push him around. I eventually had to hover between the two and mediate while she continued to just speak to me and ignore the issue. It ended on a better note when I gently asked her to watch over Mike while talking because I was unable to listen to her and help both of the boys at the same time.\n\nThe second playdate ended up being an overnight stay at my place because she had lost her job and asked me to watch him for her interviews the next day, and the easiest was to just have him stay overnight. There were meltdowns and a couple of fights between the boys over toys again until Nikki left and Mike was calm, on a hunch I gave Mike a pair of noise-canceling ear protection and that helped significantly, and the boys got along great after that. Further playdates were similar, I figured out that a less populated playground nearby was quiet enough to prevent meltdowns with Mike.\n\nTwo weeks after the sleepover I woke to Dean screaming in his room and I walked in to find bedbugs on his wall and bed. Having worked in the hotel industry for a while I knew how to handle them, and got them cleaned up. After two months of constant paranoia, I think it's finally in the clear. During this time Dean was also very sick from strep and RSV, canceling playdates. I mentioned this in passing when talking to Nikki to re-start the playdates and she admitted that she was fired from her job because they saw a bed bug on her shirt, and stated that her apartment has been infested for years and it's no big deal.\n\nI suggested ways to take care of it, including contacting housing or me giving Nikki everything I had to take care of it, and she said she wasn't interested. Having had them before during a move and working in hotels I just can't wrap my head around being okay with them. I am really uncomfortable with Nikki and Mike in my house or going to their place during the winter, and feel like I will be an AH for permanently canceling the playdates between the boys.  \n\n\nedit: my new partner feels that I would not be the AH for canceling as it is her responsibility for both.", "created_utc": 1669645956, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6y2t7/wibta_for_permanently_canceling_playdates_between/", "score": 524, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Bedbugs are no joke, and someone who *willingly* lives with them is not someone you want around you. I can't imagine just... letting them be. I moved into a house with bedbugs and I still have nights where I wake up panicking because I thought I felt something crawling on me, even though it's been a year since I had the whole house heat-treated. I also can't imagine what it must be like for her poor son. Bedbug bites *itch*, and if he has sensory issues, that might be making everything worse for him.\n\nI hope your friend gets her son the help he needs, but it sounds like you and your son are better off not meeting up with them until/unless she gets the bugs out of her home and learns how to manage her son's sensory needs better.", "NTA but it\u2019s actually child endangerment for your friend to not take care of those bed bugs. She could be in a lot of trouble. It\u2019s a big deal. Idk how you feel about it but I would report her to CPS for not taking care of the bed bugs. Seems like the friendship is dead and this way you can help her son who is clearly being neglected", "I have suggested the solutions to her and she did recently get him signed up for an assessment through a local children's hospital with my financial assistance for the assessment. She was resistant at first because her parents told her it was a 'boys will be boys' situation.", "Cool I  hope things go well with them.\n\n>boys will be boys\n\n I hate that phrase. It is a copout to avoid parenting.", "NTA.\n\nNikki is endangering the wellbeing of both her and your child, and the only thing you have control over is the wellbeing of your own kid.\n\nI feel really sorry for Mike, and I would suggest even considering calling CPS since living in a house with bed bugs is far from a safe environment for a 5 y/o child.", "NTA. I would tell her straight up that while she might be okay living like that, that you don't want to risk picking them up from her *again*.  I really feel bad for her kid and wonder if this doesn't rise to the level of involving CPS.", "Nta. \n\nBed bugs are nasty. As a NYer, I had to move north to find out they were real. \n\nIt's one thing to pick them up while on a train it's another if there is an infestation. \n\nShe didnt get fired for 1 bed bug. She got fired for refusing to fix it. \n\nDo not contaminate urself to make her feel better about you.", "NTA, she knowingly exposed you to bedbugs, I'd be livid and done with the whole friendship nevermind the playdates.", "NTA\n\nProtect your child and your home.  Gross.", "NTA", "NTA. She will infect your home again. It's disgusting", "NTA.\n\nI've had bedbugs before and wouldn't dream of dragging those into someone else's home.

So Nikki\u2019s nonchalance about her situation is baffling, and also neglectful and cruel given that she has a young child.

Especially after you tried to help.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.   \n\n\nDo not open your house to be re-infested with bedbugs.

This is actual neglect and I\u2019m sure the bed bugs aren\u2019t the only the only thing she\u2019s just not dealing with. This doesn\u2019t sound like a safe/healthy environment for the child at all", "I'm surprised no one has said anything. But bedbugs do transmit diseases. Some deadly. It is absolutely a health risk, and is not a safe environment for the child to just...live with them. And even if she hears this and does take you up on the treatment, are you sure she'd take the proper steps to keep the child and herself safe? Bedbug insecticides can be deadly as well if handled improperly.", "It wasn\u2019t until I asked my roommate that I found out she had gotten bites, too, but she still didn\u2019t get nearly as much as I did. I also have sensitive skin so I was in horrible shape and would put on bug spray just to go to bed - which that sensitive skin didn\u2019t enjoy but it was better than getting bitten. My ptsd is so bad I literally broke into hives miles from my house and my first thought was bed bugs were on my sweater. I wouldn\u2019t wish bedbugs on my worst enemy", "Boys will be boys is supposed to mean .... they will do weird gross things. Or dare dvile things.

Don't be like Nikki.", "NTA. Bed bugs are a basic, foundational, important thing to take care of because they are annoying and extremely hard to get rid of. If you don't share her nonchalance towards one of the most persistent and annoying pests, you are eminently justified in not seeing her anymore, let alone in not letting the children play together.", "She knows that autism is genetic, right? It\u2019s incredibly heritable. If she\u2019s autistic, then not only are her kids more likely to be autistic, but her parents are. If they\u2019re not diagnosed, they may have no idea that their personal experience isn\u2019t the norm.", "The fact that you\u2019re \u201cone of her last remaining friends\u201d is a red flag. Maybe take into consideration why she doesn\u2019t have many other friends when deciding if you want to remain in contact with her. But you\u2019re definitely NTA for stopping all future play dates.", "You mentioned she is autistic and as a autistic person sometimes \"beating around the bush\" is very much lost on me and sometimes I do things that I don't realize are socially wrong. Before throwing in the towel try sitting her down and tell her that bedbugs are difficult to get rid of and the bites irritate the kids and you think it would be of everyone's best interest to get rid of them. If your still willing you could even offer help to do so. You can tell her that you noticed that she has a hard time knowing when to pitch in with the boys so maybe instead of letting the kid go by themselves you think it would be nice to play a game the 4 of you together so you can both be attentive to the kids. If not you could also just tell her there's a problem with the boys and you guys should mediate. \n\nA lot of allistics don't seem to realize being as subtle as possible isn't helping and to us it doesn't appear at all or like a passing comment and not advice. If you want this friendship to work you have to clearly communicate your grievances instead of just assuming they understand your issue. Obviously it isn't your responsibility to help them but from experience having a friend that understands that your brain works differently and therefore needs more explicit communication really made me enjoy my friendships more. In fact my bestie sees me as a kind of little brother she never got to have.", "It instantly made me think of that poor woman who thought her boyfriend was drugging and assaulting her in her sleep, turned out she had a horrible bedbug infestation she wasn't aware of. You don't mess around with bedbugs.", "\"The common bed bug (Cimex lectularius) has long been a pest \u2013 feeding on blood, causing itchy bites and generally irritating their human hosts.

However, unlike most public health pests, BED BUGS ARE NOT KNOWN TO TRANSMIT OR SPREAD DISEASE.\" Source: EPA website, emphasis added. They're still nasty & need to be gotten rid of ASAP!!", "This, and also: just because Nikki doesn't always respond to Mike's meltdowns doesn't mean she doesn't want to help out.\n\nI've noticed in myself (diagnosed ASD lvl 1, at 38 years of age) that when I'm engaged in a conversation, my children's behaviour often doesn't register with me until someone else gets up to do something about it. I've been horribly paranoid about coming off as one of those \"doesn't want to parent their kid\" parents, and have since started overcompensating a bit, to the point where people tell me to let the kids figure it out for themselves... but it's a journey. OP mentioned that Nikki does watch Mike when reminded to do so, which makes me think it's not about lack of willingness to parent. But things need to register in her brain.\n\nSimilar with the bedbugs issue. Having a serious conversation with her about bed bugs being a dealbreaker for lots of people, including OP, might sort this problem out.", "That's horrifying. Does that mean they were crawling in her mouth? \n\n\nWhen my grandpa passed his house had bed bugs and my parents let me take a piece of his furniture. I'm surprised they risked it (but nothing happened, my dad is good at getting rid of bugs, and I was so upset because he passed pretty tragically so they weren't going to tell me no lmao).", "Oh for sure! Imagine how painful it is for that poor child!! To have constant bites and be in pain! My heart is breaking just thinking about it.", "Yeah, \"boys will be boys\" is supposed to be for harmless dumb shit.

And she would feel woozy the next day and find wetness on her chest. So it fit symptoms for something like rohypnol and she was trying to fill in the gaps.", "Omg. That's scary, I didn't know their bites could do that.", "NTA Protect your family against bugs. You raised it with her already so you gave fair warning. Since she is autistic, you might want to have another go. Be explicit about health concerns and how you will go NC if she doesn\u2019t fix the problem.", "Your child is being negatively affected. YWBTA if you didn't cancel playmates and keep them out of your home.", "NTA", "NTA though I do feel bad for Mike terrible living conditions and obviously some sort of sensory issues.", "NTA. \n\nBut if she's not willing to handle the bed bug problem then you should be calling child services, so they can be informed that she's putting her kids health and safety in danger. That's disgusting and unsanitary, not to mention that she's sending her and her kid to other people's houses and work with bed bugs. Ewwww. \n\nIf she got fired because they saw one bed bug, then their is more that was going on. \n\nStay away from her for your family health and call child services immediately.", "NTA. Bedbugs?! Nope! And it sounds like Mike needs to maybe be assessed for his apparent aversion to noises. I think you.may need to get in touch with CPS. Your friend needs help.", "Yeah that's a boy thing. \n\nLike girls can be gross bit a game of farting or not ball not their thing", "NTA! You couldn\u2019t possibly be the AH here. I feel very sorry for Mike though, that\u2019s very neglectful and disturbing behaviour from your friend. \n\nIt\u2019s good that Mike is having an assessment because there does sound like a high chance he is on the spectrum from your post and hopefully a diagnosis will help get him the support he needs, for school and so forth.\n\nYour friend really needs to be pushed on the bed bugs issue though, that\u2019s not something she should be ignoring. If she won\u2019t listen to you then I think you have no choice but to report her. It is not fair for that poor boy to be subjected to an unhygienic living environment.", "A little girl died from a severe lice infestation. While I don't think you can die from bedbugs you can get secondary skin infections, scarring and fatigue from lack of sleep.

I\u2019m not one to judge parenting, but this is neglect. A one off bed bug infestation happens, and as long as it\u2019s handled properly, like you did, it\u2019s not really an issue. Knowing you have bed bugs and being completely okay with you and your child being eaten alive, letting your kid and probably yourself spread the infestation to other homes, and *losing your job* because of it is neglectful and disgusting.
