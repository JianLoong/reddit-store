We were 'the outcasts' in the early 2000s, me because of a combination of Goth/ADHD and her because of Poor/Autism. There were others in the group but Nikki and I kept in touch over FB despite the long distance. We supported each other in the process of both of us becoming single moms when our exes turned out to be not good partners.\n\nI recently moved back to our hometown and Nikki excitedly set up a playdate between her boy 'Mike'  (5) and mine 'Dean' (4). The first playdate was rocky, Mike had numerous tantrums including throwing toys and sand at Dean or trying to push him around. I eventually had to hover between the two and mediate while she continued to just speak to me and ignore the issue. It ended on a better note when I gently asked her to watch over Mike while talking because I was unable to listen to her and help both of the boys at the same time.\n\nThe second playdate ended up being an overnight stay at my place because she had lost her job and asked me to watch him for her interviews the next day, and the easiest was to just have him stay overnight. There were meltdowns and a couple of fights between the boys over toys again until Nikki left and Mike was calm, on a hunch I gave Mike a pair of noise-canceling ear protection and that helped significantly, and the boys got along great after that. Further playdates were similar, I figured out that a less populated playground nearby was quiet enough to prevent meltdowns with Mike.\n\nTwo weeks after the sleepover I woke to Dean screaming in his room and I walked in to find bedbugs on his wall and bed. Having worked in the hotel industry for a while I knew how to handle them, and got them cleaned up. After two months of constant paranoia, I think it's finally in the clear. During this time Dean was also very sick from strep and RSV, canceling playdates. I mentioned this in passing when talking to Nikki to re-start the playdates and she admitted that she was fired from her job because they saw a bed bug on her shirt, and stated that her apartment has been infested for years and it's no big deal.\n\nI suggested ways to take care of it, including contacting housing or me giving Nikki everything I had to take care of it, and she said she wasn't interested. Having had them before during a move and working in hotels I just can't wrap my head around being okay with them. I am really uncomfortable with Nikki and Mike in my house or going to their place during the winter, and feel like I will be an AH for permanently canceling the playdates between the boys.  \n\n\nedit: my new partner feels that I would not be the AH for canceling as it is her responsibility for both.", "created_utc": 1669645956, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6y2t7/wibta_for_permanently_canceling_playdates_between/", "score": 128, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Seems there's a lot of drama when they do have playdates, and Nikki doesn't seem to want to help out much. Also the bedbugs things is so irresponsible, the fact she didn't do anything about it is bad enough but the fact she wouldn't warn you or apologise after you got them because of her is so bad.", "NTA \u2013 I would stop the friendship all together. Having had bedbugs and gone through the 90 days of hell to get rid of them, I would no way be friends with somebody who doesn\u2019t deal with the issue.\n\nNot worth it on so many levels. Bedbugs, constant, tantrums, your child not super happy. What are you getting out of this friendship?", "NTA It is your place to decide what you are okay with you and your child are exposed to. Also have you brought up the solutions you found for mike with his mom? It seems that he may have autism or some sort of disorder. I am not a doctor by the way so if I am wrong and overstepping then sorry.", "Ew NTA.\n\nIt's your house and your kid and it's your decision as to whether you want to have bedbugs in your house.  I know I would immediately cancel all playdates if I were you and not have either that woman or her child anywhere close, much less in the house.", "NTA. Who wants bed bugs??", "It's not safe for your child.  End of story.\n\nNTA", "I literally have PTSD from bedbugs....I was the only one in my apartment getting bitten; dozens of bites every morning; and I have a severe reaction to bug bites.... with zero cause found; called exterminators, set traps and NADA.... it wasn't until the day we moved out that we took the pictures off the wall and saw them all behind the pictures scurrying up towards the apartment above us... had to unpack EVERYTHING and go to the laundromat to wash it all in HOT water before it went to the new place; threw out offer half my furniture; and bombed the rest that we couldn't part with.... ugh it was a nightmare. \n\nNTA  NTA  NTA", "Just the bed big issue alone is reason enough to cancel .NYA", "Dean will not be allowed to attend public school if he shows up with bed bugs. Someone will force her to deal with this in a year. \n\nShe never returns any favors. Sounds like an all give and no take relationship.

Bedbugs are no joke, and someone who *willingly* lives with them is not someone you want around you. I can't imagine just... letting them be. I moved into a house with bedbugs and I still have nights where I wake up panicking because I thought I felt something crawling on me, even though it's been a year since I had the whole house heat-treated. I also can't imagine what it must be like for her poor son. Bedbug bites *itch*, and if he has sensory issues, that might be making everything worse for him.\n\nI hope your friend gets her son the help he needs, but it sounds like you and your son are better off not meeting up with them until/unless she gets the bugs out of her home and learns how to manage her son's sensory needs better.", "NTA but it\u2019s actually child endangerment for your friend to not take care of those bed bugs. She could be in a lot of trouble. It\u2019s a big deal. Idk how you feel about it but I would report her to CPS for not taking care of the bed bugs. Seems like the friendship is dead and this way you can help her son who is clearly being neglected", "I have suggested the solutions to her and she did recently get him signed up for an assessment through a local children's hospital with my financial assistance for the assessment. She was resistant at first because her parents told her it was a 'boys will be boys' situation.", "Cool I  hope things go well with them.\n\n>boys will be boys\n\n I hate that phrase. It is a copout to avoid parenting.", "NTA.\n\nNikki is endangering the wellbeing of both her and your child, and the only thing you have control over is the wellbeing of your own kid.\n\nI feel really sorry for Mike, and I would suggest even considering calling CPS since living in a house with bed bugs is far from a safe environment for a 5 y/o child.", "NTA. I would tell her straight up that while she might be okay living like that, that you don't want to risk picking them up from her *again*.  I really feel bad for her kid and wonder if this doesn't rise to the level of involving CPS.", "Nta. \n\nBed bugs are nasty. As a NYer, I had to move north to find out they were real. \n\nIt's one thing to pick them up while on a train it's another if there is an infestation. \n\nShe didnt get fired for 1 bed bug. She got fired for refusing to fix it. \n\nDo not contaminate urself to make her feel better about you.", "NTA, she knowingly exposed you to bedbugs, I'd be livid and done with the whole friendship nevermind the playdates.", "NTA\n\nProtect your child and your home.  Gross.", "NTA", "NTA. She will infect your home again. It's disgusting", "NTA.\n\nI've had bedbugs before and wouldn't dream of dragging those into someone else's home. If she doesn't care enough to rid her home of bedbugs so as to not have her son bring them into your home, her son simply does not get to enter your home.\n\nCancel the playdates and let her know that you're not going to risk another bed bug infestation after offering to help hers just because she's choosing to be lazy and ignore the issue. She has no right to make her lack of care your problem.", ">stated that her apartment has been infested for years\n\nD:\n\nNTA", "I almost feel like this post should have come with a trigger warning because I am constantly terrified of getting bedbugs.  So Nikki\u2019s nonchalance about her situation is baffling, and also neglectful and cruel given that she has a young child. And while she may not care about what happens with him (unfortunately), that doesn\u2019t have to be the case with you. Especially after you tried to help.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.   \n\n\nDo not open your house to be re-infested with bedbugs. Btw, if you are renting yourself, that can cause legal issues with your landlord(s).", "You have a very good point. A long time ago it was support and companionship\u2026. Is it just feels like I\u2019m being guilted into remaining as one of her last remaining friends", "It\u2019s wild that I had to scroll so far down to see this. This is actual neglect and I\u2019m sure the bed bugs aren\u2019t the only the only thing she\u2019s just not dealing with. This doesn\u2019t sound like a safe/healthy environment for the child at all", "I'm surprised no one has said anything. But bedbugs do transmit diseases. Some deadly. It is absolutely a health risk, and is not a safe environment for the child to just...live with them. And even if she hears this and does take you up on the treatment, are you sure she'd take the proper steps to keep the child and herself safe? Bedbug insecticides can be deadly as well if handled improperly.", "It wasn\u2019t until I asked my roommate that I found out she had gotten bites, too, but she still didn\u2019t get nearly as much as I did. I also have sensitive skin so I was in horrible shape and would put on bug spray just to go to bed - which that sensitive skin didn\u2019t enjoy but it was better than getting bitten. My ptsd is so bad I literally broke into hives miles from my house and my first thought was bed bugs were on my sweater. I wouldn\u2019t wish bedbugs on my worst enemy", "Boys will be boys is supposed to mean .... they will do weird gross things. Or dare dvile things. Not assult you and tear up your things in a fit, that is a kid thing because they lack impulse control"]}
