Or maybe dark/neutral/school-colors legwarmers. If shoes aren't pre-defined, tall boots might work. The long skirt is still an option\u2014 if and *only if* she promises not to hike it up (I'm surprised the school doesn't police that!?); if you hear even *one time* that she has, the deal is off and she goes to pants jail, the end.
