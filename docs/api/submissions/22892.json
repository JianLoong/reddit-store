I'd call and ask where they were and it was always at some restaurant, theme park, movie, arcade, bowling or something. I was feeling left out and basically stranded at the hotel. \n\nThe next to last day, I found a waterpark in walking distance from the hotel so I took the boys for the day and got them treats and souvenirs. Joe called while we were there and asked what I'm doing, if the boys are enjoying the hotel and I told him we're at the waterpark right now and going to see dine in movie afterwards. That set him off and he started yelling at me for not inviting him and the girls. That Sara and Lucy love waterparks and going to the movies, and I know this so I should have made sure to include them. Joe then told me I'm a heartless bitch for excluding them and he'll make sure to treat Mark the same way from now on. I tried pointing out that I've been left at the hotel with no car and not invited to anything this whole trip. Joe said that's different because he only sees Lucy a few times a month and Sara once a month if that, because she's in college 2 hours away from home.\n\nJoe ended up extending his and the girls time by 2 days so they could get 2 days at the waterpark, to make things fair. We're all back home now and he's giving Mark the silent treatment, calling me cruel and a bitch, and barely doing anything with Nick.\n\nAITA?\n\nEta: we split the cost of the trip 50/50 if that matters, everything came out of our joint account.", "created_utc": 1690048266, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156qkv1/aita_for_excluding_my_stepkids_from_a_waterpark/", "score": 611, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
