I'd call and ask where they were and it was always at some restaurant, theme park, movie, arcade, bowling or something. I was feeling left out and basically stranded at the hotel. \n\nThe next to last day, I found a waterpark in walking distance from the hotel so I took the boys for the day and got them treats and souvenirs. Joe called while we were there and asked what I'm doing, if the boys are enjoying the hotel and I told him we're at the waterpark right now and going to see dine in movie afterwards. That set him off and he started yelling at me for not inviting him and the girls. That Sara and Lucy love waterparks and going to the movies, and I know this so I should have made sure to include them. Joe then told me I'm a heartless bitch for excluding them and he'll make sure to treat Mark the same way from now on. I tried pointing out that I've been left at the hotel with no car and not invited to anything this whole trip. Joe said that's different because he only sees Lucy a few times a month and Sara once a month if that, because she's in college 2 hours away from home.\n\nJoe ended up extending his and the girls time by 2 days so they could get 2 days at the waterpark, to make things fair. We're all back home now and he's giving Mark the silent treatment, calling me cruel and a bitch, and barely doing anything with Nick.\n\nAITA?\n\nEta: we split the cost of the trip 50/50 if that matters, everything came out of our joint account.", "created_utc": 1690048266, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156qkv1/aita_for_excluding_my_stepkids_from_a_waterpark/", "score": 2560, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As someone raised by and around many assholes, let me explain what happened here:\n\n1. Husband spoke to his daughters who said they don\u2019t want to go on a kiddie vacation and do baby things. He implied/promised/felt pressured to promise to do big girl things with them all exclusively so long as they would agree to go.\n\n\n2. Husband didn\u2019t talk about this promise with you because either he didn\u2019t think you would mind, he knew you would mind and didn\u2019t want to deal with your disappointment, or he honestly does not have the emotional capacity to consider your and Mark\u2019s feelings.\n\n\n3. By day 3-5, he started to notice that you don\u2019t like being a free babysitter and Mark doesn\u2019t like being stuck doing nothing. Your husband started to feel bad.\n\n\n\nWhen non-asshole, well-adjusted and self-aware people feel bad they apologize and make amends. This would be him including you from that moment on. Apologizing for the way things went. Promising a second trip just the three of you to do whatever Mark wants. It would include him saying \u201cI feel bad\u201d and \u201cI am sorry\u201d and \u201chow do I make this right?\u201d\n\nWhen asshole, maladjusted and unaware people feel bad they use their energy to figure out ways to make themselves feel justified. A great way to do that is to convince themselves that you deserved to be treated the way you did by picking a fight. You can\u2019t feel bad about treating someone poorly whom you are angry with and feel deserves to be treated poorly. [Think cheaters who accuse their innocent SO\u2019s of flirting]\n\n4. **Husband picks a fight with you on day 5 to make himself feel better.** Here, it was because you went to a water park without calling him ahead of time. Had you stayed in the room? It would have been because you made yourself a martyr and moped. Or because you spent too much on room service. Or because you didn\u2019t think ahead and plan for a second vehicle. It would have been something. As long as you are the bad guy, he\u2019s the victim here.\n\n\n5. Now he needs you to apologize. That\u2019s what he\u2019s waiting for. If you agree that you were in the wrong you can validate that he was right all along about everything. His silent treatment of Mark and Mark\u2019s house arrest? Your fault. Your shitty vacation? Your fault. Even him feeling bad about all of it. Your fault.\n\n\nYou need professionals, OP. It can be a therapist, a couples counselor or a divorce attorney, but you\u2019all need professionals.", "This is not about a water park. This is about control. He's punishing you (and your poor son) for doing something without his permission. You deserve more than that.", "Please leave with your sons. This man\u2019s behaviour is inexcusable and will not improve.", "He went off without them before the water park, though.  The \"punishment\" was extending the girls' stay two extra days.

He owes you for the extra days & events you missed out on.", "Just leave.  Like I said Joe is dumb dad.  No wonder his ex divorced his dumb brain.", "He treats you and your kids like garbage. Your son is growing up with a stepdad who abuses his mom and gives him the silent treatment because he went to a waterpark after being stranded at a hotel for a week.  You deserve better and so does Mark.", "Of course not. Staying in the suite with the girls is his way of playing \"super dad\" to screw it to thei mother and his current wife could fund his revenge while he neglects and abuses her until she leaves him.", "My ex husband reacted exactly like this on a holiday where I was trapped with small kids and a baby while he went off drinking with friends he made. When I found my way about and planned a great day out with the boys he lost his shit. His behaviour only escalated from there. He's an ex for a very good reason, but only after I stopped ignoring these red flags!", "Red flag number 5-8 (because this one is so BIG) he acted on his retaliation threats, and he\u2019s giving the child the silent treatment", "He extended his and *his* daughters stay (red flag 5) for *2* days of water parks without OP to make it fair for OPs 1 day (so he gets more again, red flag 6) and actually followed through with the retaliatory actions against OPs son.\n\n\nAnd OP had to pay for half.\n\n\nOP needs to run, this is just one trip I hate to imagine how the rest of the relationship goes.\n\n\nAnd the argument that he wants to spend time with his daughters. What bullshit. He has every right to spend time with them. But the *whole* trip. Why even take the wife and son.\n\n\nDon't get me started on the whole step child crap.  Your married. That means those kids are family too.", "I agree. And to bring attention to the \"bitch\" comment, in a past abusive relationship I wouldn't have turned a blind eye to him calling me a bitch. Not because there's nothing wrong with it, but because that's how he spoke to me and bitch was definitely a mild insult. But now I am in a healthy loving relationship, if he ever called me a bitch it would really have me question everything. Op please put you and your kids before this man", "It makes we wonder what would have happened if his daughters hadn't decided to go - whether he would have spent any time at all with the boys, or just gone off by himself for the whole vacation and dumped her with the childcare anyway.  \n\n\nAgreeing with everyone else - her husband's a dick and she's NTA.", "Although I think cold-shouldering his 9-year-old stepson takes first place, right behind that for the \"disturbing prize\" to me is that he had to \"get even\" by extending the stay two days to go to the waterpark. \"Getting even\" is disturbing enough as a concept but the fact that he needed two days to make up for her one day just ratchets up the creepiness. He had to be on top, not just even.\n\nShe doesn't actually say who went to the waterpark those two extra days. Was it just him and his daughters or all of them? Somehow, I think I know the answer. But I hope I'm wrong.\n\nMeanwhile, she never \"got even\" with him for eating at restaurants without her.\n\nI can't even fathom the creepiness of his mind. It gives me the shivers.", "Better no dad than one who will abuse him because he\u2019s throwing a tantrum you didn\u2019t go into a little box like a doll as soon as he turned his back on you.", "Mark is being emotionally abused by this man", "That's not a dad-that's an abuser.

As a child with an abusive dad I wish my mom had left him far sooner.", "I\u2019m going to tell you a little story. My mom has 4 kids, 3 fathers. She married my step dad at age 5/6, (youngest 2\u2019s father) and he was the only dad I knew for over 10 years. But he treated me like shit. The whole step family did. And she allowed it. Christmas with them was torture. Millions of presents for everyone, and nothing for me. They eventually divorced. Then the boyfriends rolled in, some of them cool, some of them assholes, and one that was very inappropriate with a 16 yr old girl. I was never a priority to my mom. I\u2019m 39 now and I will never forget that time in my life. I will never allow my children to ever feel the way I felt.
