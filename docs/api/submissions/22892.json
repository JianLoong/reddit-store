We have a 1 year old boy together, Nick and I have a 9yo, Mark from a previous relationship. Joe has Sara 19f and Lucy 16f from a previous relationship. \n\nWe planned a week long vacation, Sara and Lucy were invited but originally declined. They decided at the last minute to go, so we had to rearrange accommodations for them, which is fine. The girls and my husband shared a suite, while me and the boys shared a queen bed in a regular room. \n\nDuring the trip, every day my husband took the girls out to eat for every meal but did not invite me and the boys to join them. I'd call and ask where they were and it was always at some restaurant, theme park, movie, arcade, bowling or something. I was feeling left out and basically stranded at the hotel. \n\nThe next to last day, I found a waterpark in walking distance from the hotel so I took the boys for the day and got them treats and souvenirs. Joe called while we were there and asked what I'm doing, if the boys are enjoying the hotel and I told him we're at the waterpark right now and going to see dine in movie afterwards. That set him off and he started yelling at me for not inviting him and the girls. That Sara and Lucy love waterparks and going to the movies, and I know this so I should have made sure to include them. Joe then told me I'm a heartless bitch for excluding them and he'll make sure to treat Mark the same way from now on. I tried pointing out that I've been left at the hotel with no car and not invited to anything this whole trip. Joe said that's different because he only sees Lucy a few times a month and Sara once a month if that, because she's in college 2 hours away from home.\n\nJoe ended up extending his and the girls time by 2 days so they could get 2 days at the waterpark, to make things fair. We're all back home now and he's giving Mark the silent treatment, calling me cruel and a bitch, and barely doing anything with Nick.\n\nAITA?\n\nEta: we split the cost of the trip 50/50 if that matters, everything came out of our joint account.", "created_utc": 1690048266, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156qkv1/aita_for_excluding_my_stepkids_from_a_waterpark/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He\u2019s playing you big time.", "Why didn\u2019t all of you go to the activities?", "NTA but look up how exclusion effects children. You need to protect your sons from him.", "That's intentional. Tell him that this is not ok. He can't treat you and the boys like luggage that you leave at the hotel while he spends time with his daughters. \n\nPlease tell me that you tried at him every time he left you behind with the boys.", "you will be the AH if you continue letting this man hurt your 9 yr old child because of some made up reasons in his head.", "I'm sorry but the next time I spoke to this awful man would be through my divorce attorney. If not for your own sake, at least for your sons. Please read back your post and ask yourself why you're staying.", "Leave him sweetie. I normally don\u2019t say this, but please leave him.", "I don't understand why you would ever speak to him again, except through your lawyer.   Your are the asshole if you don't get your children away from this abusive man.", "This is...very bad? Aside from the fact that you don't deserve to be treated this way, he's modeling this behavior for your children and by staying with him you are basically endorsing it.", "And you are letting your son putting out with this treatment???? Sometimes not having a dad it\u2019s betters than being stuck with a shitty one", "That kind of 'dad' is just a cruel man who's willing to give a child emotional damage that could last a lifetime.", "Better to have no dad at all than to have a terrible one.", "That is very unfortunate for Mark. I wouldn't want Joe anywhere near him.", "The suite was originally for us and the boys. Sara and Lucy decided last minute they were going. Joe had the hotel book another room, the cheapest one they had and told me that's my and the boys room.", "OP has said in the original post they had separate rooms, he was with his daughters and she with her sons.", "I just wanted to do something with the boys at least one day we were there. Nick is too young to care but Mark was in tears because we weren't having any fun.", "Why are you here asking if you\u2019re the AH?\n\nGet this man away from your son.", "Leave him honey", "Why didn\u2019t you and the boys go with them?", "It gets better and better the more details you share :(", "I'm sorry but I'm very confused. You say that you were paying 50% of this trip. Why did you not just . . . tell him no? At that point, when he informed you that he was taking the suite with his daughters and relegating you to a cheap room on another floor by yourself with a baby and a 9-year-old on your own vacation, why didn't you just ask him WTF he thought he was doing? Or refuse?\n\nTo be clear, I'm not blaming you. He is clearly an absolute AH. But it sounds like you just kind of let him steamroll you right out of a vacation you paid as much for as he did. Like, again, after the first day that he took off with the girls, why not just say to him, \"I thought this was a family vacation? WTF is going on here? Why would you leave me sitting alone at the hotel with two small children while you go eat and do things? What did you think we were going to do all day?\" \n\nNone of this makes any sense.", "I hate to break this to you, but you\u2019re not married with a partner. You\u2019re living in the same house with an AH who doesn\u2019t care about you and your sons. You either have to choose that you can live with that or start seeking out other solutions. \n\nI\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re NTA, but you will be if you continue to raise your boys in this environment.", "Yes. He was in the suite on the 14th floor, while me and the boys had the cheapest room available on the 2nd floor.", "Has your husband always treated Mark badly?", "of course you did! Mark knew his step family was having a ball and he wasnt being included. How sad for him. Your husband is a hypocrite, bully and all around horrible human.", "leave him", "If it was 50/50 split why on earth would he get a suite and you get the cheapest room?", "Wow. He\u2019s not even trying to hide the favouritism is he. That\u2019s really unfair on the boys.\n\nNTA", "Why wasn\u2019t he staying with you guys instead of a suite with the girls?"]}
