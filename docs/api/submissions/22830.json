In the US it is customary to tip a few dollars for each day you stay that they clean the room By leaving some cash in a very visible spot. I usually tip at least $5 a day because I once had a job where I learned a lot about their working conditions.

You would then leave a much larger tip at the end. \n\nThis should be common knowledge I thought. It\u2019s a tough job. Similar to service on a cruise I always leave cash. I usually estimate $5 per day and I don\u2019t wait until the very end to give it. $10 if my toddler is with us. I leave it somewhere very visible each time they come in. I want to make sure the exact person cleaning my room gets the tip.", "To me, it also depends on where you stay.

I spend one week a month in hotels and it\u2019s polite and standard practice to hang the sign on the door when you don\u2019t want service. Housekeeping generally comes along in the morning.

You know you are why are asking us?", "NTA. I have no idea but it annoys me to no end when housekeeping comes in before checkout.

And do a bit of everything, including cleaning. I would have double-checked that you were actually out of the room. Hell, I even wait til official checkout time to bother going in the rooms unless I know folks have left.\n\nI get why the housekeeper was annoyed. But if it had happened to me, I'd just shrug it off as horrible timing on my part. Yes, I'd be upset, but unless the keys or card have been turned in, then it is best to consider the room occupied.

It's exploitative, cheap on the employers' part, etc. but the solution is NOT to punish the wage slave who is powerless.\n\nAlso rude to not tip delivery drivers a reasonable amount for the same reasons.\n\nI would love for the US tipping culture to change so that a tip is something given for unusually excellent service and people in those industries have a steady, reliable living wage.
