Typically hotels should not clean a room on its last day until well after checkout time to avoid this situation. That's why checkout time is typically 11 or 12, and checkin time is typically 3 or 4.\n\nThey tried to optimize, and just made more work for themselves.", "NAH it sucks that so many people just leave without checking out so I see why they may have thought the room was done for the stay but neither of you did anything wrong", "NTA , but you should put a sign on door if you plan to go back. The housekeeping have it tough and making them clean twice sucks. Plus had they not seen you next person gets a bathroom that wasn't cleaned. I once checked into a room that had a shower that must have been used within the hour of when I checked in. Not a good feeling as single traveler wondering if someone else had key.", "NTA.  The room was yours until 12.  It was the housekeeper's fault for assuming incorrectly that you were done with the room early.", "NTA. \n\nThe room was still leased to you and she made an assumption that you'd checked out early.\n\nI hope you didn't get undue attitude over using your room; however, I hope you were considerate enough to tip her for the effort/inconvenience. \n\nThat she didn't tidy the room the day prior has no bearing in this case. Many hotels have gone to every-other-day cleaning schedules. \n\nThis benefits the hotel's costs, but reduces the maid's earning potential, which really isn't fair to the maid or the customer.", "NAH.  It definitely sucks for the housekeeper, but you hasn\u2019t checked out yet.  If anything, I put that on the communication between the front desk and the housekeeping staff.  Not the first time I\u2019ve heard of/seen a lack of communication - every few months I go to this one hotel in Philly and on the day of checkout, I always ask for and get a late checkout, but housekeeping don\u2019t seem to be informed and have almost come in while I was still there.", "NAH - This is one of the problems with not having to actually click a link or talk to the front desk to check out. They assumed that you were done because your stuff was gone and it was close to checkout. But you paid for the room until 12p.

You paid for the use of the room until 12.", "This is hard, as I am an accomodation cleaner. Correctly so, you had the room until 12:00, so sure, you should be able to use it until then. However, housekeepers have a limited amount of time to clean before check in times. We start with the guests who have \u2018checked out\u2019 which in this case, appeared to be you. I would have done the same thing and began cleaning your room, to help myself make time for the other rooms.

It was a logical assumption if you had removed all of your personal belongings, but that is still no reason to be upset with you.", "I usually do this to but I was intending to check out earlier, just didn't have time", "As someone who used to be a hotel housekeeper, I at least appreciate the sympathy here! It was a terrible job (and very very few people ever tipped).", "As a housekeeper (who just left another comment) I appreciate your mention of the pressure to turn over before check ins. We start with the \u2018checked out\u2019 rooms.", "I didn't realize housekeepers are supposed to be tipped. How do I go about doing this going forward? Do i add a tip when checking out? (I don't carry cash or a purse/wallet). Should I just not ask for housekeeping service if I don't need it?", "Having worked in a hotel, 3-5 hours is not enough time to turn over all of the rooms that check out in a day and housekeepers absolutely turn over rooms earlier than check out time IF (and only if) that room has been definitively checked out. It sounds like OP did not check out though, so the room should not have been touched, although if a housekeeper knocks and then sees a room that appears empty (no belongings) it is a very reasonable assumption that the person has left and just not bothered to go through the formal checking out process (which happens A LOT) \n\nNAH", "*** I hope you didn't get attitude from the maid, I mean. I'm sure you were very polite with the staff. :-)", "Yeah, it happens. Either way, you shouldn't have any guilt for using your room during your stay. Even if it was an hour or less before check out and the room had been cleaned. The cleaning staff can only be mad at whoever assigns them rooms.", "I tip them, just leave a few bucks on the table. I'll often leave a note with the tip thanking them for their hard work as well, just to make it 100% clear that the loose cash sitting on the table is for them.", "I don\u2019t know if you are in the US. In the US it is customary to tip a few dollars for each day you stay that they clean the room By leaving some cash in a very visible spot. I usually tip at least $5 a day because I once had a job where I learned a lot about their working conditions.  The job is incredibly physically demanding (flipping mattresses, cleaning bath tubs), they are under pressure to flip rooms in much less time than is reasonable, and they are paid very poorly.  It has a very high instance of on the job injuries.\n\nPlease always tip your housekeepers.", "My minimum tip is 5$ a day, suites 10$. In the future out your DND sign on if you are not needing services until after checkout.", "Yea it has to be a couple dollars cash you just leave in the room", "I usually leave 10-20 dollars and I draw a smiling onion on the note pad in the room.\n\nWhen I was a housekeeper I would draw the same onion somewhere in the note pad in the hopes someone would see it", "Just because you don\u2019t request service doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not doing any work. I actually read it is much much harder for them if you don\u2019t have them come in regularly because your room will be much dirtier and therefore harder to clean. You would then leave a much larger tip at the end. \n\nThis should be common knowledge I thought. It\u2019s a tough job. Similar to service on a cruise I always leave cash. I usually estimate $5 per day and I don\u2019t wait until the very end to give it. $10 if my toddler is with us. I leave it somewhere very visible each time they come in. I want to make sure the exact person cleaning my room gets the tip.", "To me, it also depends on where you stay. We just stayed somewhere for 2 nights. 0 interactions with housekeeping after coming back 2nd day ( so they were not in the room- no requests for towels,TP or anything) we didn\u2019t tip, but we did \u201cclean up\u201d. Put all garbage in cans, used towels in bath tub, counters cleaned off", "Hotel manager here, and you're definitely NTA.\n\nWhile I can't speak for all hotels, I've worked for most major brand hotels, and the way it works is more-or-less the same across the board.\n\nHousekeeping is given their room assignments, which also include the checked out guests. Any room not listed as checked out needs to be confirmed before starting pretty much specifically to avoid something like from happening. \n\nEssentially... housekeeper did this to themself, so I don't really find any sympathy for them.", "YTA if you didn\u2019t use the \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign on your door to let housekeeping know not to come in.\n\nEDIT: why is this downvoted? I spend one week a month in hotels and it\u2019s polite and standard practice to hang the sign on the door when you don\u2019t want service. Housekeeping generally comes along in the morning. Also, most people just LEAVE\u2014 they don\u2019t formally go check out. Be kind to working people who are cleaning up after you!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTheir chaos and their bad processes are not your fault. You rented the room until checkout, you are fine to use it until checkout.", "NAH. You weren't wrong, but it's a good lesson that if you and your belongings are not in the room on checkout day, it will be assumed that you have left.", "We ALWAYS leave  $40 or more depending on how long we stayed and how much work will be involved cleaning it. We always do the dishes and start the laundry if possible, sometimes no W&D. Always try to leave the place as clean as possible! NTA but start leaving tips!!", "NTA", "Nta. As someone who runs an inn, no. That sucks for her, but the computer, even for a 15 room inn like ours, keeps track of check outs.

They see me and interact with me and I get tipped a lot more because of that, I find.", "The issue is that many people don't officially check out, they just leave. So it's usually a safe assumption that the guest is gone if their stuff is (I used to work in housekeeping).", "Most housekeepers need to clean at least 12 to 16 rooms a day.  They need to start immediately to get that done in time for check ins.", "That is false. They usually start cleaning rooms very early as it takes all day.", "What country are you in? In the UK we don\u2019t tip.", "You can't check into a hotel without a credit card and ID, so I am skeptical about your claim you dont carry a purse/wallet. What is it, a sandwich baggie?\n\nCarry cash. You travel now. This is how it works.", "It doesn't matter if you don't request housekeeping; they have to clean the room before anyone else can use it. So you should always leave a tip. If you don't want housekeeping while you're there, just leave the tip in the room when you leave. And you should *always* have at least some cash on you; you know that card readers can go down, right? What would you do then if you couldn't pay for something you needed? If nothing else, travel with enough cash to leave a tip for housekeeping.", "Many people have little card holders that attach to your phone. Just enough room for a couple credit cards and your ID. Not enough for cash or extras. It\u2019s good for people that don\u2019t want to carry extra items around, especially while traveling.", "While also stripping the magnetic chip, I've heard haha. But yes fair point.\n\nMy cash point stands.", "Those can still fit a folded-up $20.", "You should have tipped. Housekeeping still had to vacuum, empty the garbage cans and replace the liners, strip and remake the bed, clean the shower/tub and counter/sink and toilet, swap out the towels, make sure there was enough TP...", "Yta yea YTA. You know you are why are asking us?", "NTA. I have no idea but it annoys me to no end when housekeeping comes in before checkout. I get it they have a lot of rooms to clean but that's not my responsibility. I don't get to check in early or late without an extra fee usually so why should I have to give up an hour?", "NTA\n\nI work at a small bed and breakfast. And do a bit of everything, including cleaning. I would have double-checked that you were actually out of the room. Hell, I even wait til official checkout time to bother going in the rooms unless I know folks have left.\n\nI get why the housekeeper was annoyed. But if it had happened to me, I'd just shrug it off as horrible timing on my part. Yes, I'd be upset, but unless the keys or card have been turned in, then it is best to consider the room occupied. Oddly enough, I've saved more time by waiting in this way because there are no interruptions.\n\nYes, tipping is more and more expected for housekeeping. Unfortunately, the common pay rate is lower than it should be considering the workload.", "Nta, you werent checked out", "They\u2019re not. It\u2019s just toxic US tipping culture at its finest. This sub Reddit also believes tipping delivery drivers anything less than 20% of your meal is a sin, don\u2019t take their advice if you haven\u2019t been.", "You leave it on the counter in the room, where it is visible to housekeeping.", "Really? Most places leave a thank you note and a gratuity envelope for housekeeping tips. Usually on the desk.", "I sometimes leave a note to be friendly. No one has ever tried to returned loose cash I left behind as if I had forgotten it.", "In the US, they are.\n\nIs \"required tipping culture\" terrible?  YES, of course it is.  It's exploitative, cheap on the employers' part, etc. but the solution is NOT to punish the wage slave who is powerless.\n\nAlso rude to not tip delivery drivers a reasonable amount for the same reasons.\n\nI would love for the US tipping culture to change so that a tip is something given for unusually excellent service and people in those industries have a steady, reliable living wage.  But that's not where we are, so yeah, if you don't tip generously, you're an AH.", "I guess I was born in a barn.  I live in the Midwest, USA and I've never heard of anyone tipping housekeeping. Now, I've also never stayed anywhere nicer than an Embassy Suites or Hyatt.  Is this a big city or nice hotel thing?  Or something that was more common in the past?", "You\u2019re actually supposed to leave smiling watermelons.", "What kind of hotels are you staying in?  They don't do that at any Marriott I've slept in.", "No, in the US they aren\u2019t. This is just toxic US tipping culture trying to make EVERY service job tipped. It isn\u2019t.\n\nI live in the US and have never once tipped at a hotel. I\u2019ve also never left the hotel in a state needing a deep clean, but if you\u2019re just a normal guest leaving a standard mess, no tipping isn\u2019t necessary. This is their job. It may suck, minimum wage should be higher, but it isn\u2019t a position that requires tipping. Please stop with this narrative that consumers are responsible for paying employees fair wages. If you have an issue with it, *contact your actual government officials rather than bullying people on Reddit into tipping people they shouldn\u2019t need to*.", "And that's why they get paid an hourly wage."]}
