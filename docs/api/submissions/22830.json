However, in the future you should hang one of those do not enter tags on your door to avoid this happening. I do it every time I'm out of my room, because I don't want anyone in my personal area while im not there, and I take it off when I'm going to check out.", "NAH. You paid for the room until noon and had the absolute right to shower there.\n\nBut I have a lot of sympathy for the housekeeper.  It is one of the very worst, most physically demanding jobs out there. They are under tremendous pressure to turn over rooms as soon as possible so it makes sense she thought you had checked out and turned over your room.\n\nplease tell me that you tipped her generously.", "NAH. \n\nYou had the room until noon. Unless you told the front desk that you were out, or checked out online, it was still yours. \n\nIt's unfortunate that housekeeping has to redo some stuff. They made a pretty safe assumption that you were done with the room. \n\nIt was just a weird situation and misunderstanding.", "NAH\n\nIt's not your fault that she assumed you already left and it's your room until you check out.", "NTA. If you haven't checked out yet, they shouldn't be doing the turnover cleaning", "NTA. If you didn't check out, it's your room.", "Unless you checked out, you should have access to the room until check out time.", "NTA\n\nYour room until you checked out. Typically hotels should not clean a room on its last day until well after checkout time to avoid this situation. That's why checkout time is typically 11 or 12, and checkin time is typically 3 or 4.\n\nThey tried to optimize, and just made more work for themselves.", "NAH it sucks that so many people just leave without checking out so I see why they may have thought the room was done for the stay but neither of you did anything wrong", "NTA , but you should put a sign on door if you plan to go back. The housekeeping have it tough and making them clean twice sucks. Plus had they not seen you next person gets a bathroom that wasn't cleaned. I once checked into a room that had a shower that must have been used within the hour of when I checked in. Not a good feeling as single traveler wondering if someone else had key.", "NTA.  The room was yours until 12.  It was the housekeeper's fault for assuming incorrectly that you were done with the room early.", "NTA. \n\nThe room was still leased to you and she made an assumption that you'd checked out early.\n\nI hope you didn't get undue attitude over using your room; however, I hope you were considerate enough to tip her for the effort/inconvenience. \n\nThat she didn't tidy the room the day prior has no bearing in this case. Many hotels have gone to every-other-day cleaning schedules. \n\nThis benefits the hotel's costs, but reduces the maid's earning potential, which really isn't fair to the maid or the customer.", "NAH.  It definitely sucks for the housekeeper, but you hasn\u2019t checked out yet.  If anything, I put that on the communication between the front desk and the housekeeping staff.  Not the first time I\u2019ve heard of/seen a lack of communication - every few months I go to this one hotel in Philly and on the day of checkout, I always ask for and get a late checkout, but housekeeping don\u2019t seem to be informed and have almost come in while I was still there.", "NAH - This is one of the problems with not having to actually click a link or talk to the front desk to check out. They assumed that you were done because your stuff was gone and it was close to checkout. But you paid for the room until 12p. So you had every right to use the shower.", "Nta you have what you paid for and it\u2019s her job to clean it", "NTA. You paid for the use of the room until 12.", "This is hard, as I am an accomodation cleaner. Correctly so, you had the room until 12:00, so sure, you should be able to use it until then. However, housekeepers have a limited amount of time to clean before check in times. We start with the guests who have \u2018checked out\u2019 which in this case, appeared to be you. I would have done the same thing and began cleaning your room, to help myself make time for the other rooms. I will\nNOT say that you\u2019re the AH, but I would recommend maybe leaving your luggage or a note to say you are coming back.", "I ALWAYS put the do not disturb sign on the door.

It was your room until noon.", "NTA \n\nId say N A H but the housekeeper had no business berating you.  You did nothing  wrong.  She goofed by jumping the gun and assuming you were fully out.  It was a logical assumption if you had removed all of your personal belongings, but that is still no reason to be upset with you.", "I usually do this to but I was intending to check out earlier, just didn't have time", "As someone who used to be a hotel housekeeper, I at least appreciate the sympathy here! It was a terrible job (and very very few people ever tipped).", "As a housekeeper (who just left another comment) I appreciate your mention of the pressure to turn over before check ins. We start with the \u2018checked out\u2019 rooms.", "I didn't realize housekeepers are supposed to be tipped. How do I go about doing this going forward? Do i add a tip when checking out? (I don't carry cash or a purse/wallet). Should I just not ask for housekeeping service if I don't need it?", "Having worked in a hotel, 3-5 hours is not enough time to turn over all of the rooms that check out in a day and housekeepers absolutely turn over rooms earlier than check out time IF (and only if) that room has been definitively checked out. It sounds like OP did not check out though, so the room should not have been touched, although if a housekeeper knocks and then sees a room that appears empty (no belongings) it is a very reasonable assumption that the person has left and just not bothered to go through the formal checking out process (which happens A LOT) \n\nNAH", "*** I hope you didn't get attitude from the maid, I mean. I'm sure you were very polite with the staff. :-)", "Yeah, it happens. Either way, you shouldn't have any guilt for using your room during your stay. Even if it was an hour or less before check out and the room had been cleaned. The cleaning staff can only be mad at whoever assigns them rooms.", "I tip them, just leave a few bucks on the table. I'll often leave a note with the tip thanking them for their hard work as well, just to make it 100% clear that the loose cash sitting on the table is for them.", "I don\u2019t know if you are in the US. In the US it is customary to tip a few dollars for each day you stay that they clean the room By leaving some cash in a very visible spot. I usually tip at least $5 a day because I once had a job where I learned a lot about their working conditions.  The job is incredibly physically demanding (flipping mattresses, cleaning bath tubs), they are under pressure to flip rooms in much less time than is reasonable, and they are paid very poorly.  It has a very high instance of on the job injuries.\n\nPlease always tip your housekeepers.", "My minimum tip is 5$ a day, suites 10$. In the future out your DND sign on if you are not needing services until after checkout.", "Yea it has to be a couple dollars cash you just leave in the room", "I usually leave 10-20 dollars and I draw a smiling onion on the note pad in the room.\n\nWhen I was a housekeeper I would draw the same onion somewhere in the note pad in the hopes someone would see it", "Just because you don\u2019t request service doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not doing any work. I actually read it is much much harder for them if you don\u2019t have them come in regularly because your room will be much dirtier and therefore harder to clean. You would then leave a much larger tip at the end. \n\nThis should be common knowledge I thought. It\u2019s a tough job. Similar to service on a cruise I always leave cash. I usually estimate $5 per day and I don\u2019t wait until the very end to give it. $10 if my toddler is with us. I leave it somewhere very visible each time they come in. I want to make sure the exact person cleaning my room gets the tip.", "To me, it also depends on where you stay. We just stayed somewhere for 2 nights. 0 interactions with housekeeping after coming back 2nd day ( so they were not in the room- no requests for towels,TP or anything) we didn\u2019t tip, but we did \u201cclean up\u201d. Put all garbage in cans, used towels in bath tub, counters cleaned off"]}
