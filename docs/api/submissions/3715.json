The fianc\u00e9 has 2 teenage sons (14, 17) and my nephew is the only of his siblings still living at home. His dad lives in a different state about 18 hours away.\n\nNephew has been having a hard time adjusting to the new living situation. He doesn't get along great with his future step-dad's kids. Nephew had been \"running away\" to friends houses and not telling his mom where he is for a couple years now. He also regularly spent a lot of time at my house as he's close with my 15 y/o grandson. He's also likes my home because I'm a lot more lax on things than his mom who can be quite strict. She is a great and loving mom, but from her son's view she can be a little overbearing. \n\nAbout 4 weeks ago he got into an argument with one of the fianc\u00e9's sons that turned into a physical fight, they both got in trouble (as they should) but nephew claims the son had been essentially bullying him for a year at this point (not the words he used but a summary of the behaviour he described). This had worsened since they all moved in together and nephew has been increasingly unhappy at home even when the other boys were at their moms. The day after this fight, he ran away to his older half-sisters (dad's side) home 2 hours away. He refused to come home for several days and missed school. Mom was very upset. I went to my nieces with my grandson to convince him to go home but he refused. I was however able to convince him to at least come back to town and stay at my house so he didn't miss anymore school. \n\nI have 3 kids still living at home (17, 11, 8) in a 4 bed house and keep a room spare for my older kids. I gave him this room and he's been staying with me for a little over 3 weeks. He's back in school, and doing everything he normally would but still refuses to go home. His mom is pissed with me because i'm letting him stay with me but his dad is happy he has the option. Brother was in town for the weekend and we all (me, brother, mom, her partner) got together and talked in person. His mom got very upset (which i understand) but then said that I'm ruining her family and her future marriage by not kicking her son out so he would go home. I suggested she and her partner need to figure out a game plan to make all their kids get along better and make everyone comfortable in their new home, she just thinks I'm butting in when i have no right. I personally want to see my nephew move back home before Christmas and don't think this should be a permanent situation, even if I'm happy to keep him until he's ready to go home.\n\nI'm torn here. On one hand I want my nephew to be in a safe space where he can be comfortable, on the other hand, as a mother myself I would be equally distraught if my child wanted to stay with someone else over me. There is no safeguarding issue here, his home is essentially fine, he's just unhappy there.

You might want to ask that she look into family therapy or therapy for all the boys. She needs a non family adult to explain to her that just because she wants them to get along it won't magically happen", "NTA\n\nHe's already essentially proven that if you kick him out he'll just go somewhere else that isn't his mom's house.\n\nThe real solution here is for his mom to get her house in order so that he'll actually be comfortable living there.", "NTA.  You said it yourself: if the kid leaves your place, he\u2019s *still* not going home.  He\u2019s just going to a friend\u2019s house or some other relative.  And if he can\u2019t do that\u2026well, I still suspect he\u2019d sooner just run away for real than go back.  At least this way, Mom knows where he is and that he\u2019s being looked after by someone who will at least try and make sure he keeps up with his education and impose some kind of structure on his life.", "NTA at all. It\u2019s a tough situation, but you\u2019re supporting him and giving him a safe and comfortable space to stay, and I think that\u2019s a really wonderful thing. It sounds like his mom isn\u2019t approaching him in a way that\u2019s helpful, empathetic, or understanding in the slightest, which is really too bad. Maybe family therapy is in order for the two of them, or even just individual therapy for the kid, but in any case i think you\u2019re doing the right thing", "NTA - his home may be physically safe but it\u2019s clearly not safe to him. Until mom is willing to take strong steps to communicate with nephew and try to help him feel safe, I think it\u2019s totally fair for him to stay somewhere else if he had the option", "NTA and honestly his mom should just be grateful she knows where her kid is and that he\u2019s safe with family instead of at a strangers. He\u2019s proven quite clearly he will go anywhere else to avoid home and at least with you he\u2019s going to school. His mom needs to fix the home situation before he ends up estranged from her. I think you\u2019re doing the right thing but it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re kind of between a rock and a hard place here. Hopefully everything will get sorted out sooner rather than later, good on you for stepping up for the kid he probably needs that a lot right now.", "NTA \n\nHis mother and her boyfriend are doing nothing to solve this bullying problem. Your nephew isn't being heard. It's good that he has a safe place with you. This suggestion is drastic, but he can become emancipated. Nobody should be forced to  feel unsafe in their home.", "Definitely NTA. Why isn't his mom stepping in when he is clearly being harassed? You're providing a safe place for him because she isn't.", "That's a hard one but I would still go with NTA.\n\nYes, you're letting him stay at your place against the wishes of his mom - which is why it's a hard decision - but his constant running away let's me think that there is more going on than him just having a hard time to adjust. In this case it's better that he has a safe place to go to/be at, than repeatedly running away without anyone really knowing were he is and it affecting his going to school.\n\n>nephew claims the son had been essentially bullying him for a year at this point\n\nHonestly, that was my thought/fear when I read the first two paragraphs. And if that is the case, this is an issue that needs to be addressed and resolved - with the help of professionals if need be.\n\n>There is no safeguarding issue here, his home is essentially fine, he's just unhappy there.\n\nIf he actually does get bullied by his future step sibling then that's not the case at all. Even if it's not physical bullying but emotional/psychological, that means he is not in a safe environment.", "NTA. Your nephew's mom is ignoring his problems with her \"new family\" because she cares more about them than her son who is clearly unhappy with the new living situation. Instead of working to make her new blended family work and show her son she puts his needs and feelings first, she wants you to abandon him like she did. If he's so unhappy at home that he's been running away for years, he's probably going to find another option if you juck him out, or he'll end up on the streets. That's not good for anyone. He's safe and well cared for at your house and is attending school, which he wouldn't be doing otherwise. I'm glad your nephew has you to support him. Stick to your guns so he knows your house is always a safe place for him no matter what his mom says. And you have his dad's permission for him to stay with you, so you're not fully going against his parents' wishes. Depending on the custody agreement, your brother may want to look in to getting it amended so your nephew doesn't have to live with his mom's new family the majority of the time. If he gets custody he can even grant edicational rights to you allowing your nephew to attend his current school while residing with you.", "If there is bullying, then it is a safety issue.  Physical fights, safety issue.  2 years of running away, safety issue.  He is not going to leave you for an abusive situation.  She may mean well but there is more going on.  \n\nShe can force him home legally but he will run away again.  Someday he might get hurt that way and never come back.  \n\nIf she wants her son at home she should consider a place for her and her son since the issue seems to be with her fiancees kids.  \n\nHe needs an independent advocate that is on no ones side but his.  Not saying you are not impartial but if you cant see all the red flags at home then you are also wearing partial blinders.\n\nCan you take him to the juvenile court for a court appointed advocate?  He needs a long term solution until he is 18 and someone on the side of what is best for him.", "It always gets tricky in these situations. \n\nGenerally I'd say NTA. \n\nThe kid clearly hates it at home and has been even before the mom and stepdad moved in together if he's spent years with friends instead of at home. \n\nI would like to think you're offering him a safe space where he can sleep, won't be bullied, and can focus on school, and then his mom might be able to figure out what's wrong at home that makes the kid so miserable he doesn't want to be there. \n\n\nIt seems like the kid would NOT stay at home even if you did kick him out, so his mom should be happy that he has a regular safe home to live in.", "NTA, I think you\u2019re doing the right thing. His mom and to-be-stepdad didn\u2019t come to the discussion willing to compromise from the sounds of things, only to get kid to go home. Would they rather he\u2019s staying somewhere out of town or unsafe? If you kick him out, what\u2019s keeping him from running off to somewhere out of reach like he did before you convinced him to come back to school? It\u2019s not your fault he\u2019s staying with you, and they can\u2019t see that", "NTA\n\nIn these situations, the best interests of the child is always paramount.  I think you're underselling the \"just unhappy\" part.  Being forced to live with someone who bullied him for a year?  I don't think so, even if we quibble about what is \"bullying\" and what isn't, the result is pretty obvious.  He's more than just unhappy.  His whole world has been shaken to the core, which, let's face it, is not uncommon when families blend.\n\nSometimes parents have to accept that when they make choices like this without considering their kids' interests, then there can be fallout.  This is one of those situations.", "NTA, but I would suggest family counseling", "NTA.   His mother needs to face reality if she hopes to have any relationship with this kid.  If he is forced home again, he\u2019s going to run away again.  Instead of thanking you for helping and keeping her son safe, she should be looking at what\u2019s best for her boy.  Maybe waiting until he was in college to marry and move kids that didn\u2019t get along and try to make them the Brady Bunch.", "This isn't a reddit question imo.  The kid needs to be in therapy and his whole family also to figure out if the dynamic can be changed.   There are also legal issues probably as he is underage so it's not up to you.  What a mess.", "NTA is 16 the age where they are legally adults? If so then yeah it's his decision. If not I think there needs to be some sort of legal process with guardianship. But if your removing him from a shitty situation then that's a good thing for him. This ain't about his mamma so don't worry about hurting her feelings.", "NTA\n\nI do think there could be legal issues here though. I'm not sure if this would meet the legal criteria for kidnapping, but the cops could return him home (I believe).\n\nCPS would need to get involved and see if there are reasons to remove him from the home, then OP could get to foster him.", "There are no easy answers or judgements on this one, NAH except maybe the step brothers.", "[deleted]", "NTA you\u2019re being a safe space for a child and his mom sucks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

None of things are awful but I can understand why they can be frustrating to a teenager.\n\nI've essentially been expecting him to do the same things my 17 y/o daughter does in terms of chores which mostly is personal chores, his room is his business he can clean it or not clean it, does his own laundry, and help me watch the younger kid occasionally. In terms of rules I don't really have any explicit rules on things such as bed time, screen time or curfew.
