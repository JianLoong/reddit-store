This kid has the healthiest immune system now.", "My dog sees or hears me chopping veggies and he runs to be ready, since something will roll off that chopping board for him.", "You can never, ever set a dish on the floor in my house, because the cats instantly know and go for it. I let them lick my plates when I\u2019m done with cat safe food, so they know that\u2019s their cue.", "Our current dog is like that as well. Now she materializes in the kitchen when we're cutting produce.", "The call in my house is \u201cHOOVER!\u201d", "The things that my dog drags into the yard and eats\u2026 we had a chicken that died and the dog buried it out back. A couple weeks later, he dug it up and ate it. We were mortified.", "Not going to lie, I might eat bacon I\u2019ve dropped in the ground\u2026", "\"Oops\" is what works for mine. \"Uh-oh\" is for when she's doing something she shouldn't. I don't even know if her paws touch the floor more than once when I say oops from the other room, she just like, leaps and flies in one motion until whatever it is hits her stomach.", "My dogs lay under my kids' spot at the table during meal time. My husband will shoo them away but I just let them clean up. They run around outside all day long and get really good dog food so the odd chicken nugget, mac & cheese bit or pb&j crust is not going to hurt them. One of my dogs is a dirty produce thief though. Leave a steak out, he'll sniff and walk away, leave a fruit or veg out? Gone! My kids know to never leave grapes or raisins anywhere for that reason.\n\n\nETA- NTA", "My dog neither eats his poop nor drinks from the toilet, but he can have fancy dirt bacon from a stranger any day of the week.", "I had a dog that would FIGHT you for the cat litter!", "Litterbox truffles", "Or those tasty \u201clawn chocolates\u201d the bunnies like to leave.", "There are pet households where they don't put the toilet lid down to prevent toilet water drinking?!  (I mean, I know there are, but I could never.)", "My dog (May she rest in peace) was once in the half bathroom and literally ripped the whole toilet seat off the toilet for the water (might I add that it was a bowl full of blue water) and consumed the whole bowl!!  After seeing the vet and being cleared, she gave us the stink eye for not letting her back in there. (Side note: DO NOT recommend!!!!  She pee\u2019d blue and shat turquoise for a week) \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "There are so many reasons I can not live on a farm.  This isn\u2019t one I had ever considered before today.", "Congratulations.   I don't think I have been so grossed out yet laughed so much at the same time.", "I call mine a vampire- I have to directly offer her the food for her to eat it 95% of the time. And even then if it\u2019s not up to her standards, won\u2019t touch it. Like the asshole won\u2019t eat *certain brands of peanut butter*", "This is also how I got the dog to loooove the vet. *\"Don't look at me buddy, Doctor Gord has the cookies now.\"* Worked like a charm!", "My friends vegan cat just died at 22 years old. It did die I guess but I don't know any cats who have lived longer.", "My old dog once had diarrhea, then ate it, then barfed that back up. I cried at then rolled the carpet up and threw it away.", "We joke that rabbit poop is kibble. All my dogs have scoured the backyard for \"treats\", as well as any visiting dog. They clearly love it \ud83d\ude05", "Mine does both. Thankfully he's not a licker though.\n\nEdit: He doesn't lick people is what I mean.", "Maybe I just come from a different stream of existence, but at a dinner,  it's not the place or time for it.", "I'm in Chicago, too, and I know exactly where you mean. Like the Southport Crunchy Mom Brigade.", "We got our first dog pre-internet days & my kids learned our new dog would leap in the air and catch grapes. It was her first trick! That dog was on boiled hamburger & rice for weeks.", "I had to train my in-laws not to do this!", "I love that!", "God this is adorable!  An absolute mess but adorable.", "Oh cats are always in charge.  I had housemates with 2 cats and the elder cat was always starting gossip and getting the younger cat to swipe at my dog.  Cats are clever!", "We have a special bag of carrots and he loves green beans and apples and watermelon. He has a sweet tooth and loves the fruits way more lol", "In ours it\u2019s \u201cuh oh!\u201d\n\nThe dogs and cats will materialize out of thin air and race each other for whatever fell", "CLEANUP gets them running in if they weren't there already.", "Haha. My kid one time found \"a cool sand box\" at my brother's house. He was playing cars in there for like, a minute, before I figured out he'd found the litter box. He was at least polite enough to stack the poops neatly on the windowsil. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude2d", "I once lived with a roommate and her dog. There was a lounge chair near the dining room that had a little floor rug in front of it. We trained the dog to sit on the rug while we ate and wait until we were done to \u201cclean up\u201d. The call for her to sit on the little rug was, \u201cgo be Jasmine!\u201d As in - go sit on your magic carpet!", "Our dog was obsessed with onions to the point she would dig them up out of the garden. We stopped growing onions shortly after we figured it out", "Darn good movie.", "Someone was probably sneaking it meat.", "Listen, cats are obligate carnivores - they physically cannot go without meat. Either someone was sneaking it meat or it was sourcing its own", "Quick before they ate it again!", "Apparently all that vegetation undergoes some magical transformation in the bunny!", "Not sure if you know as a new pet owner grapes are actually poisonous to your dog. Not judging, we didn't know either and about a decade back we had a rescue that didn't like the indoors. She stripped all the grapes off the volunteer grapes in our backyard and got sick. That was when the vet told us, I mean we were dog owners for years before that rescue and didn't know.", "Dogs can't eat grapes the skin is poisonous to them", "We call it \u201ctootsie rolls\u201d in my house.", ">We also refer to it as Kitty Roca.\n\nWe do too.  I forget where I heard it first but it's just hugely appropriate.", "This made me cackle", "Agreed. Criminally underrated.", "Apparently \ud83d\ude02\n\nI swear, idk what it is but every dog I know loves it!", "I think that may be why they mentioned the dog being in bland food for weeks afterwards.", "I know now, but she was our first dog & I was really stupid thinking dogs can eat fruit. One Halloween, I was still at work and my kids wanted to go trick or treating & didn't want to wait for me to get home. They'd already dumped the candy we were giving out into my fancy Halloween candy bowl & they left it on the chair where the large dog had no problem getting at it. She ate 3 bags of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and all that happened was she pooped orange wrappers for a week. This was before I found out chocolate was poisonous for dogs. I could write a book called Patsy Was Not Supposed To Eat That and it would not be a short pamphlet. She also got into the cat litter box & for a year we lived in a very old house where we couldn't flush tampons. I could just go on and on. We loved her anyway.", "I used to feed my min pin raisins. He loved them. I had\nNo idea they were bad for him and I had dogs my entire life. Luckily he never got sick.", "I grew up with dogs and had no idea about grapes until I asked a stranger sitting on a bench next to me if I could give one to his begging dog. They are way more dangerous than chocolate!", "My childhood dog was like that. He had the stomach of a goat and an insatiable craving for chocolate. We did our best but big, busy house with lots of people going in and out meant things happened. The doofus wound up loving two years past his breed\u2019s typical lifespan. I think he was the dog equivalent of that one person who smokes, drinks, and has bacon each day and still makes it to 100.", "Ooh, just to add, tampons shouldn't ever be flushed. Even if the house plumbing can physically handle it, it's really bad for the sewage system further down the line. UK here, may be different elsewhere I guess!", "I once lost almost a full pack of Oreos to a dog!  It was my fault - I thought middle of the kitchen island was far enough out of her reach.\n\nIt was NOT!\n\nLuckily, that was also the day I realized just how little actual chocolate is in Oreos.", "A serious tangent, but some fruits are just fine. Mine love bananas and apples (no cores or seeds).  And watermelon. Can\u2019t get enough of that.", "It\u2019s the same in the US too. Tampons and Pads are why 90% of womens public bathrooms are never working.", "They're probably also bad for dogs.", "And now there's signs in every bathroom I've been in to not flush them.\n\nEdit: Every public bathroom has one.", "I am no longer in need of feminine hygiene products, but you'd think sewer engineers would design systems that can handle tampons. I can understand not flushing pads and people who do should be fined for vandalism, but tampons are smaller than most solid poops.  \nWe need more women wastewater engineers.", "Yeah. Some people can\u2019t read either unfortunately \ud83d\udc80", "The problem isn\u2019t necessarily with size, it\u2019s because unlike toilet paper & solid matter like poop, tampons and pads cannot break down in water like other things can. Your solid bodily functions are able to be broken down and flushed, usually ending up in a tank or sewage line someplace. Tampons and Pads, despite difference in size, are made of a kind of material that is meant to withhold liquid (blood in this case) and as such, it actually expands when liquid is added to it. \nYou can flush one tampon and you might be able to get away with it. But over a months time, maybe even longer or shorter given how old the plumbing is internally, that\u2019s when problems happen. Because the tampon or pad has at that point, gotten so expanded that it\u2019s now blocking the exit way for the sewage to escape to. This is why I have seen so many people particularly in trailers, have an issue with sewage coming up in toilets, sinks & bathtubs, not just because of tampons, but a lot of people aren\u2019t really \u2018in the know\u2019 of what you should put in your drain and not lol\nEdit: I\u2019m not saying the one tampon can cause problems btw, I\u2019m saying continuously flushing tampons or pads after the one time can lead to issues lol", "I think the issue is more that it's very hard to design a tampon that will quickly degrade in the sewer system but not in your body. \n\nThat being said, if we're okay sticking used pads in the bathroom trash we should be fine sticking used tampons (wrapped in tp of course) in the trash!", "It also includes flushable/baby wipes, cotton balls/q-tips, and condoms as well.\n\nThe intersection by my house would flood constantly anytime it rained. I talk to the guy working on it and he was saying that it is filled with that type of stuff.  It never breaks down and it doesn't move out of the system until they pump it out."]}
