She kept the pit down for several days, but eventually she puked it up. In the 30 seconds it took for me to run and grab a paper towel, she gobbled it back down again. When it came up again a few days later, I took no chances and grabbed it with my bare hands. Dogs are fuckin gross, and having them means sometimes you have to do some really gross stuff", "My parents got their first family dog when they had babies for th explicit purpose of eating baby puke off the floor. Okay there were other reasons too but still that was definitely on the list\n\nLater I lived in a major city with my own dog for his entire life and that little man got sooooo many sidewalk scores! I always let him eat it as long as it was safe. Ice cream cones, sandwiches. Once I spilled a milkshake on the carpet at work and let him lick it up, you couldn't even tell where it was when he was done.\n\nDogs are friends, family, and the most efficient wetvac!", "I always feel so bad telling people no!", "Okay.

They spontaneously create proteins from thin air? No they eat plants and create the proteins you think only come from meat.\n  \nIt's hilarious every single time vegan is mentioned on Reddit there are 40 comments saying how it's impossible to have a nutritionally complete diet as a vegan.

Luckily he pulled through.", "This is true.

Cats are not one", "For what it's worth, in case it makes you feel better in retrospect, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups don't contain all that much actual chocolate. Not that anyone should take any chances, but most popular American chocolate products aren't actually all that bad for dogs for that reason.", "our dog is exactly the same! she has eaten an entire box of chocolate mints and a tray of chocolate cookies without getting sick. we all panicked, but i guess she never got the memo that that stuff was poisonous to her", ">Patsy Was Not Supposed To Eat That\n\nThis sounds like it could be a great children's book on dog ownership.

Which disproves your theory they cannot live on a vegan diet.", "Your dog is Keith Richards?", "Yes, and this will age me.

She very politely takes it from your hand and then walks away and spits it out. It\u2019s just lovely finding it several hours later by stepping on it.", "It depends on the chocolate content.

Taurine deficiency can also lead to blindness in cats, amongst other severe eye issues. And cats, as **obligate carnivores,** are unable to synthesize taurine and require it from direct sources. \n\nHow did my grandma live til 80 despite putting back two packs a day?
