My friend (\u201cBob\u201d 29M) knows that this is a sensitive subject for me because family members often try to convince me to reconsider my choice.\n\nFast-forward: Bob and I are hanging out with a couple other friends at a bar. It\u2019s a sober night. Toward the end of the night, Bob passingly mentions that I would be a good parent. I confusingly asked him why he\u2019s bringing that up, since he knows I don\u2019t want kids. He goes on to claim that I don\u2019t want kids because of some latent trauma relating to my parents and potential genetic issue (my family has a history of genetic heart diseases). He mentioned that I\u2019m a giving and caring person, so it\u2019s a shame that I don\u2019t want to be a parent.\n\nI reexplained the reasons I don\u2019t want kids (e.g., don\u2019t like them, finances, etc.), stated that he could potentially damage our friendship if he keeps trying to implicitly or explicitly persuade me to have kids, and asked him to stop. Our other two friends try to chime in, reaffirming that everyone in our friend group knows that I don\u2019t want kids and that it\u2019s a perfectly valid decision. Bob then says that he isn\u2019t fully convinced of my reasons. I say that it\u2019s unfair for me to unconditionally support his desire to have kids, while he claims to support my decision to not have kids but still tries to persuade me otherwise.\n\nWe eventually get to a point where he acknowledges that he\u2019s going to try to stop. Then, he laughs and comments about how he enjoys riling me up. Confused and upset, I ask him to confirm if he pushed a sensitive issue solely to see my reaction. He said \u201cyes\u201d and, before he could try to explain his justification, I got up and left the bar.\n\nI felt deeply disrespected because I don\u2019t think friends should intentionally upset each other just to see their reactions. It\u2019s manipulative and border-line bullying behavior. To his credit, he tried to apologize before I left, but not before he tried to justify what he did.\n\nThat brings me to my question: AITA for leaving the bar immediately after my friend admitted that he tried to convince me to have kids solely to upset me?", "created_utc": 1679714461, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1218y05/aita_for_leaving_dinner_after_my_friend_purposely/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sorry that happened to you.", "NTA\n\nWhat kind of friend purposely makes someone else mad and angry?\n\nIt's super frustrating when people pressure young adults to have kids. You are more than mature enough to make your own decision about these matters.", "NTA. People who do this are just fucking awful. I\u2019ve never understood why they think it\u2019s fun to intentionally annoy or upset someone- to derive pleasure from someone else\u2019s discomfort or pain is honestly so twisted. You don\u2019t need Bob in your life, and I don\u2019t see any reason for you to try to keep him around. Good for you for standing up for yourself. Telling someone they should have kids simply because they\u2019d be a good parent is obnoxious and places a superbly weird lack of value on individual happiness. You don\u2019t owe the world kids.

You\u2019ve already explained your reasoning and he knows about pressure from your family. His \u201criling you up\u201d is disrespectful and shows he\u2019s not a true friend.

Its not like the human race is dying out or anything!!\n\nI would distance myself from Bob, especially if he continues doing this and/or does it to your other friends.

With that behavior I really don\u2019t want him to have kids. He\u2019d probably make his kids think they have anger issues.", "NTA.

Why do you care so much about what other people think? \n\nMany people don\u2019t want kids, there\u2019s nothing wrong or unusual about not wanting them, if your friends and family treat you otherwise then you should just laugh quietly to yourself as if they told you that grass is purple instead of green.
