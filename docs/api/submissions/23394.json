It doesn't sound like they told you, or asked you to move.\n\nI wouldn't worry about them calling the police -- it was clearly an accident.  Don't blame them too much for overreacting.

It is always an AH move to hit a baby, accident or not.\n\nI don't understand the votes with N T A at all. I know it was an accident. That doesn't change anything. Putting yourself in a position where you are very likely to hurt someone is no less AH than deliberately hurting them. It's why drunk driving is illegal. You put yourself in a position where you are likely to hurt others.", "Yta.  Volleyball on a busy beach.... Asshole move.  And you had no skill and control.  Another asshole move. \n\nThen calling the police is a bit much, but you should learn to read the room.", "NAH\n\nIt was a busy public beach. You are entitled to set up wherever you want, and the \"hitting the baby in the face\" thing was an accident.\n\nObviously if the baby was hurt the parents are still entitled to be upset.\n\nAnd I'm so sorry, I'm an awful person, but I absolutely cracked up reading this. And I have a 3-month-old baby in my lap right now, haha.

Maybe  next time  be more mindful of your surroundings, find a more secluded place. It's not exactly the best idea to play volleyball where other people are chilling. I'd also be pissed if that ball hit me while I was sunbathing.", "NAH and I'm kind of chuckling at the YTA comments. Could a family not see a volleyball game going on? Could they not choose to move if they were that concerned about a ball near a baby?\n\n A busy beach is no place for a newborn infant that would get it's head smashed in by a volleyball, and if they were older than that, maybe one or two covered in blankets, they're fine. Family was being dramatic, and you could have set up elsewhere, but it's not a big deal aside from the familys complete overreaction.", "YTA it seems like you set up the game without any consideration for your surroundings or fellow beach goers. You only thought about YOUR volleyball game but not how it might effect others around you.", "eh YTA - you should've moved somewhere away from the family or anyone close for that matter.", "YTA, if you all suck at the game it's expected that the ball would go astray at some point. Don't set up your net next to a family. A ball hitting a baby is pretty bad, and it doesn't seem that u properly apologise for what u did", "YTA if you set up second\n\nIf they set up there after volleyball was in play then no", "NTA.  That baby should have better heads up awareness.  A volleyball is easy to see coming, it\u2019s like the size of a medium-small watermelon.  Hard to miss flying through the air.  Not your fault", "YTA sort of. I think being aware of your surroundings and being considerate on a busy beach day, is important. At least ask the people nearby if they\u2019re comfortable with you playing. Then it\u2019s on them if something happens. If they were already there, they shouldn\u2019t have to move.", "NTA them calling the police is so overboard", "This is a hard one, but I\u2019m gonna say NTA. It was an accident and people play sports on the beach all the time.", "NTA.\n\nIt was an accident and you yelled to warn them.", "NTA \u2013 a volleyball isn\u2019t going THAT far in an amateur game, so this one is completely on the parents for choosing to sit that close.", "Nta it's an accident", "NTA. I get the parents being mad, who wouldn\u2019t be, but it was an accident.", "YTA why don\u2019t you just lags or where away from people if you there was a chance of hitting someone else", "NTA. Not the correct use of the police force? It was an accident and if it was anyone's fault it was the parents for keeping the child so close to the game", "YTA. They asked you to move and you should\u2019ve!", "Read the title, assumed not, was correct. Nta", "JESUS!!! People nowadays think they can call the cops over anything. Accidents happen. For crying out loud. NTA.", "NAH. You should say sorry and perhaps accommodate them to the hospital if the baby has serious injuries. It is a honest mistake, you are at the beach and you are allowed to play volleyball.", "NTA: it's a public beach and it was an accident. Plus no cop will ever arrest someone for accidentally hitting someone with a ball", "NTA.  Accidents happen, and you can only act based on the information available to you. However, it might serve to be a bit more cognizant of your surroundings.", "YTA\n\nI am confused why you think hitting a baby with a volleyball is an ok thing to do. Sure you didn\u2019t mean to, but it was entirely predictable. \n\nIf not the baby, don\u2019t you think it highly likely that you would have hit one of them? Why did you expect them to leave the beach?

You\u2019re giving quite the extreme example. They were playing a game and they accidentally hit a child. Simple as that. While understandably upset, threatening them with police was out of order.
