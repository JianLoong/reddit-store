Yes, it sucks having to walk far with beach and volleyball gear, but if you want to play volleyball it is your responsibility to do so in a way that does not hurt or hinder others\n3) if you must play volleyball and can only do so in a crowded area, play with a beach ball that can't do any damage, and make sure to bring some cash so you can buy a replacement if you knock down someone's drink or something", "YTA for playing volleyball on a busy beach.
