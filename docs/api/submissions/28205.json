{"id": 28205, "submission_id": "16zc45o", "title": "AITA for not apologizing after calling my wife a nerf herder?", "selftext": " I (29m) and my wife (30f) have been together for over ten years. She does not care for movies at all and has not seen any Star Wars except for Episode 7, only because I wanted to see it so badly in theaters when it first came out. I\u2019m not a super fan or anything but she knows I\u2019ve seen and enjoyed the movies and my parents love them too. \n\nFor context also, she and I haven\u2019t had what is considered a \u201creal fight\u201d in about six years. Just minor arguments.\n\nTonight we were watching YouTube videos and just relaxing on the couch after work. We do this nearly every day and we both enjoy it. I don\u2019t remember exactly what she said first, but I remember it sounded goofy so I said something like \u201cwhat are you even trying to say, you scruffy looking nerf herder\u201d and started laughing, expecting her to laugh along. I know she hasn\u2019t seen Star Wars, but even without context I thought that was a hilarious and playful insult. We normally go back and forth like that all the time without meaning any harm. This time, she did not agree. \n\nShe immediately exploded on me and started yelling and pacing around our apartment. I tried to explain that it\u2019s a quote from Star Wars and it isn\u2019t a real insult, but maybe she didn\u2019t comprehend what I was saying because she was seeing red or something because she basically ignored what I said and kept getting more angry. (I\u2019m the type that freezes under pressure like that). I was telling her how confusing this fight is and I have no idea why she\u2019s so mad or how it escalated to this point so fast, which in hindsight did not help the situation either. \n\nAfter saying it a couple more times, she finally understood that I was telling her it\u2019s from Star Wars. I thought the fight would finally end, but instead the fight pivoted to how I didn\u2019t apologize. That just made me more confused. She had been yelling and arguing with me for a while (no idea how long but it felt like an eternity) and never apologized to me, even though a single google search or even her asking \u201cwhat\u2019s that?\u201d would have stopped this fight from ever happening to begin with. I\u2019m not apologizing for quoting one of the most famous movies ever made, even if I knew she hasn\u2019t seen it.\n\nThe fight went one for so long that she ended up going to a friends house to get out of our apartment for the night. I\u2019m regretting it more now that I\u2019m sitting here alone, but I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s fair to force an apology out of me when I didn\u2019t even do anything wrong to begin with, the whole situation was just a big misunderstanding, right? At least not without her apologizing first for blowing up over something so trivial that she didn\u2019t even know the meaning of. \n\nI know being right or wrong shouldn\u2019t matter with the love of my life, but this situation really escaped me. Since we haven\u2019t had a bad fight in so long maybe I am being too complacent.

How hard is it to just give a quick apology when you accidentally hurt someone's feelings? Is pride worth this huge fight?", "Absolutely. It\u2019s just strange to draw a line in the sand that you\u2019ll apologize for lighting the fuse when the other person apologizes for the explosion.", "Someone's feelings are always valid, but that doesn't mean they're rational or justified.  \n\nThe way I see it, \"validating\" someone's feelings just means that you never tell someone that they're not feeling what they say they're feeling.\n\nIn this case, it's clear the wife is upset by \"nerf herder\".  I'll be honest, I don't think her feelings are \\*justified\\* (I admit, I'm a huge Star Wars fan so I have a very hard time acting as if I \\*don't\\* know the context, but it doesn't feel like it should be that bad), but they do exist.\n\nNTA as long as OP is telling the truth that they do, in fact, regularly banter.", "You may have missed the part where he said, \"we normally go back and forth like that all the time without meaning any harm\"... They mess around in a playful way, is what I take from that which is what he tried to do in this case as well.", "It\u2019s definitely not an insult. It\u2019s actually closer to implying you\u2019re hopelessly attracted to your partner\u2014that\u2019s the context for Leia yelling this \u201cinsult,\u201d which we have no idea what it means as viewers, at Han and then kissing her own brother in a desperate attempt to obscure her feelings.", "If they have a solid marriage with hardly any arguments and he's not regularly throwing around insults and verbal abuse then yes, I think she should be assuming positive intent or at least pausing to understand what he actually said before going on a long tirade.  Not sure where you get love it and laugh from, but ok.", "There's no way she'd be leaving just due to that. There's obviously a history behind her reaction, as well as his bizarre, nonsensical determination to deliberately annoy her.", "My partner could call me much worse and my response would be to ask why, not blow up for hours and demand an apology. This has narcissism written all over it.", "\"HOW DARE YOU? YOU *KNOW* HOW SENSITIVE I AM ABOUT MY NERF COLLECTION!!\"", "Because he obviously upset her this time, and it would cost him nothing to apologize for doing so.", "In the original, Han shoots and Greedo keels over.  \nIn the late 90s remaster, Greedo fires a shot off as he\u2019s keeling over.  \nIn the later edition, possibly blu ray release? They have Han and Greedo shoot at the same time and digitally make Han\u2019s head jerk to the side to make it look like he dodged.  \nFinally on Disney+ Greedo randomly shouts something like \u201cmaclunky\u201d like he\u2019s warning Han he\u2019s about to shoot, then shoots first, which Han digi-dodges, then Han returns fire.  \nGive it another ten years and Greedo will appeal to Han begging him for death because he only turned to bounty hunting to raise money for a painful terminal illness, and that dying in combat is the only way he can restore honour to his ancestors, and Han will reluctantly execute Greedo as an act of ultimate mercy.", "I'm saying he didn't insult her.", "It was a harmless joke which she completely overreacted to. Op is NTA.", "Lmfao", "I don't think an apology can even be honest if you don't understand why it upset them in the first place, which she would not explain. If you're saying you should just act in a different way than you believe just to appease people when they're not being rational, I don't think that's good advice.", "So you'd be cool with your partner calling you a scruffy  stinky pig herder? Cause that's what he did.", "So you're totally cool with your spouse using any insult they can think of for you right.", "It\u2019s not worth your time going back and forth with people like this, honestly. Notice how the people calling him an asshole are all terminally online. These people don\u2019t have normal relationships let alone having a significant other, that\u2019s what results in these braindead takes.\n\n \u201cHe insulted her!\u201d Only someone who has no irl interaction could say something this moronic, because their word view is filtered through text (more specifically Reddit), so they can only think in this binary sort of way. Like tone and body language and relationship history doesn\u2019t mean anything.", "Scruffy nerf herder is an endearment like baby girl or baby boy.", "Yes. But that\u2019s just me", "Scruffy looking nerf herder doesn't seem very insulting, a little weird but not insulting.\n\nIf you want to extend that to \"using any insult they can think of\" that's up to you. I'll stick to what was actually said.", "No it's fucking not", "Cool I don't like the people who are supposed to love and support me calling me names even make up ones.", "To any Star Wars fan, it is!", "Dude nerfherder is 1) the insult one about to be romantic partner hurls at the other to cover her attraction, so in context it\u2019s a term of endearment and 2) the correct reply (\u201cwho\u2019s scruffy looking?\u201d) implies that the other about to be romantic partner doesn\u2019t even think nerfherder is an insult worth refuting.", "And not everyone\u2019s the same as you.", "It literally just sounds like an insult when context isn't known which he knew she did not know", "Except the wife in the post seems to feel the same.", "But that\u2019s nonsensical. If I call you a l\u00f6kenbrauterleipzer, which is not an actual German word as far as I know, and you fly off the handle because you assume it\u2019s an insult, how is that not unhinged?"]}
