That guy was just frustrated and took it out on you", "NTA and you dodged a bullet seeing as he's already an angry man after minimal contact.", "NTA. You handled a common scenario completely appropriately - you can\u2019t please everyone.", "NTA. Phew you dodged a bullet with that hot head.", "NTA.  You did the best possible.  Having him travel to see it when you weren't considering him would have wasted his time and been much less considerate.  (Some people do that to avoid confrontation, but it's rude - the person just doesn't know how rude you're being.)", "NTA, it sounds like you notified the other scheduled viewers as soon as you made your decision. In many places, especially big cities, rentals often go very quickly. The guy who complained should have realized that. Fortunately for him, in a hot market there will be many other places available. He might be new to renting, in which case he'll learn that this is just how things are.", "Some people don't handle disapointment well. NTA", "NTA. you made a decision. You let the person know.

You aren't obliged to rent it to that person, nor are they obliged to move in. \n\n\nYour only other option would've been to let him.view the room, then tell him afterwards you went a different way. That would've wasted more of his time, at which point you would've been the AH. In this situation, you told him ASAP.", "NTA situations like that are first come first serve and if you\u2019re comfortable with her as a roommate then you\u2019re well in the clear. It\u2019s not uncommon to have multiple appointments in case someone falls through.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your apartment and decision", "NTA\n\nThis guy does not understand you save him the trouble to come.\nI assume you would rent to the one who will ask first and someone has already asked for it.\nEven if he comes, looks at the rooms, likes it and asks to rent it immediately somebody has already asked.", "NTA - I mean at least you gave him a heads up the room was rented before he drove out to see it, and if you already put it out that the room was first come first serve and someone made a decision then there is nothing more to it, it sucks he didnt get a chance to see the place but at least you didnt waste his time.", "NTA and it seems like you dodged a bullet with him anyways if that's how he acted . be\nglad you didn't rent to him an move on with your life", "NTA.  It sounds like you made your intentions clear with everyone who wanted to look at the room.  Someone decided to take it and you took them up on the offer, I don't see the big deal.  Also, judging by the way he reacted, you probably dodged a bullet with that one, so congrats on that.", "NTA you advised him before he drove out to see it, he was just disappointed to not get the room so he was rude to you. Lucky you don't have to deal with him anymore.", "NTA. You stated your intentions beforehand, and he made a losing bet that no one would make a deal before he had the chance to look at the place. It sucks for him, but that's life.", "NTA .. you didn't want that guy as a roommate", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe aim IS to rent fast.

You're saying the opposite. \n\n\nYes, first come, first served. But I think that if it gets rented, it's polite to cancel future appointments.", "Alright upon reflection I see your point", "She canceled the appointment an hour and a half prior to the showing? She literally says that in her post. That is also typical. I\u2019ve gotten messages less than 20 minutes prior to a showing that it was taken already. It\u2019s just how renting typically goes. It\u2019s a shit process but it\u2019s how it goes lol. Can\u2019t get a week in advance notice on canceling something actively being listed for rent ASAP lol.", "Ummm....yeah. and I was responding to a post that said she should have honored the appointment even if her mind was already made up.", "NTA. First come first served. You probably dodged a bullet with that one anyway if they're fuming about you not holding it for them", "NTA. It's not your problem they were coming from far away and were inconvenienced.", "NTA. While it was frustrating for the other guy, you did exactly what you needed and were well within your rights. I am sorry that he berated you OP, but you are in the right here. Good luck with your new housemate.", "NTA It is first come first served. It is very hard to get a room to rent at a reasonable rate and they can go really fast. His attitude reveals you probably dodged a bullet.", "NTA. Renting is first come first served. As long as you told him as soon as you reasonably could, that\u2019s just how it is.", "Dodged a bullet, your daily life with this roommate sounds as if it would be miserable. NTA", "I will respond to ads on Nextdoor and sometimes I get told that item's been sold already. I don't throw a tantrum, I accept that I needed to move faster. That's life.", "NTA - He blocked you? Problem solved.", "NTA\n\nYou were upfront and honest.\n\nThis process is done by other people/organizations who rent rooms/apartments/homes pretty frequently.", "NTA, especially since you told immediately and hopefully helped him avoid the drive. Really not sure what else you could have done, maybe the timing was a bit unfortunate but that wasn\u2019t really in your control. But also if that guy was acting like this over a slight disappointment, it\u2019s much better you didn\u2019t rent to him anyway", "NTA And I think you dodged a bullet with that guy considering how he handled it.", "I asked a fried about it and he seemed hesitant to side with me, which is why I decided to post about it, but I'm glad most people agree there wasn't a better way to handle it. And yes, his frustration was totally understandable, I apologized for being unable to honor the appointment too, but there was no need for him to try to offend me.", "I admit it's very hard for me when someone is unhappy because of something I did, but I'm working on that.", "That's my thought process for doing 'first come, first serve' instead of choosing out of a number os applicants. If I ask people to wait, they also have no obligation to accept my request if I chose them later. Plus, showing the apartment takes time, organization, and often some people can't come right away, so I might need to wait days for one of the first people who talked to me to be able to come and visit. I'm always a bit uncertain about who I chose as a roommate, but I've been very lucky so far, and until today, my way of doing it never caused anyone ill feelings."]}
