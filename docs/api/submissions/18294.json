Aswell as stating what I would normally charge for a wedding this sized. I then texted her to ask if we could get some lunch and talk.\n\nWhen she arrived I showed her the list and explained that I'm not asking her to pay this but I wanted her to see how much I'm helping her and how much money I am losing by doing her wedding instead of taking on a client who would pay. At first she was shocked at the amount and accused me of lying to try and make her feel bad, I was able to show her bills from other weddings I had done before and a quick Google search showed that my prices are pretty average, she had never looked up any wedding planner or their rates bc she assumed I was always gonna do it.\n\nShe said she thought it wasnt that much as I didnt seem to be well off, I told her that while it does pay well I cant take on crazy amounts of clients since I need to give quality service and that I might not always get clients all year, plus I have a few medical expenses that can take out a large chunk.\n\nShe said I still must have some money saved up, I said I do but that I would be having to use it to cover my bills and stuff since my income is taking a hit due to taking on her wedding, after a while of insisting that some of the items on her registry arnt that expensive she relented, I wouldn't have to get her anything since I had gotten her enough discounts to qualify as a gift and that she was grateful for my help and services.\n\nHonestly, I didnt know how much this was stressing me until that relief washed over me, I was thankful that this was over and we could continue with planning her wedding. I asked her to clear things up with our family as they wont talk to me about it, she agreed and sent a group text explaining that the gift incident was just a misunderstanding and that we had talked it out and cleared things up.\n\nFor those who are saying that her registry seems very expensive, her new husband, his family friends, and alot of her friend are very wealthy, and she makes sure our parents and other close family are taken care of so she kinds has become disconnected from people with \u201cnormal\u201d financial status like me. There are alot of things on the list like designer handbags, clothes, shopping sprees, dinners, and even a car and second home on there. The cheaper items are some simple jewelry she liked.\n\nShe paid for my part of the lunch as an apology and since I'm struggling and things are all good now I think, thanks, everyone.", "created_utc": 1685195203, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t7xuy/update_wibta_if_i_didnt_get_my_sister_a_wedding/", "score": 321, "replies": [">She said she thought it wasnt that much **as I didnt seem to be well off**\n\nYet she still insisted on a wedding present in the first place?\n\n>after a while of insisting that some of the items on her registry arnt that expensive **she relented**\n\nWell, that was mighty big of her.\n\nGlad you reached a resolution and I hope that will be the end of the wedding drama. \n\nHave you had any apologies from the other family members?", "If you are happy, I am happy. I think that\u2019s it.", "She thought your work wasn\u2019t worth much because you are poor, so she expected you to do it for free, and *also* come up with money for a gift? Glad you set her straight, OP.", "She has a designer purse and a vacation home on her wedding registry? \ud83e\udd28", "Thank you for the update. It sounds like a good solution. Nice for you and also your sister.", "I do not buy the \u201cdisconnected from normal financial status\u201d line. If she\u2019s that affluent she would have heard plenty of bragging on how much other had spent on their weddings. It becomes a pissing contest who can put on the biggest show. She is just incredibly greedy. I mean even after all of that explanation she had the nerve to question your savings ?!? She sounds awful.", "You did the absolutely best thing one can do: you reached out and had a conversation. Well done.\n\nI would keep my distance from that person in the future though. The conversation showed you she had grown distant enough from \"average\" people to cause issues. Accusing you of lying and having you show receipts was awful. Network at the wedding, fish for good clients, and then put it behind you and hang out with less stressful people. Best of luck with your health.", "You should use that sister to network and get higher paying clients OP.", "Good heavens. This lady needs an etiquette book. It's very sad that she's using her wedding as a money grab - doesn't bode well for the marriage. Hope the wedding goes smoothly and that you never plan for free ever again! Get that bread!", "I remember your post. I\u2019m glad you were able to work things out for the sake of your family but your sister is still a massive AH and terribly entitled. Not if but WHEN she gets married again, put your foot down as to planning the wedding and get her a toaster.", "At last the update!!!!!\n\nI\u2019m glad it worked out for you and while your sister sounds like an axe wound, it sounds like you got the resolution you wanted and it\u2019s a weight off of you.", "Glad it\u2019s resolved but totally shocked designer handbags would be on a wedding registry! \ud83d\ude33", "I\u2019m actually glad you didn\u2019t do what I suggested in my comment on your post. Some of us just enjoy living our petty fantasies through this sub and that was one of those moments. \n\nBut I AM glad you did the numbers and gave her a reality check. She needed to really see what you were actually gifting her so she could fully appreciate what you have done for her. Well done OP!", "Did you get the part where she asks for a second home or a car on her registry? \n\nI mean designer clothes and handbags aren\u2019t that expensive, but she was still asking for things thousands of dollars a pop. Even jewelry is a couple hundred for a piece. And I always figured a wedding gift is for both the couple to use, even though one or two items may favor one side or the other.", "I second this very sweet comment.", "she dose, its kinda insane to me at least but she insisted it was normal for \"people like her\"", "Ikr!

Did she have listings for properties she liked? Can I ask how much they were", "I don't like your sister.", "That is not a wedding registry. A wedding registry contains items needed to set up a household, not an actual additional second house!", "omfg I can't imagine being so entitled as to \\*lay out an argument\\* for why someone should buy me a gift", "I would have also have asked her to explain exactly what she had said to the other family.", "Wtf, she has a car on her gift register!!!", "I\u2019m glad you were able to be reasonable and come to a mutually acceptable resolution of the issue.", "Welp since her husband and family and all her other friends are loaded. You should have gone to lunch with a gift and an invoice.", "Wow, I\u2019m speechless. I cannot believe someone would lay out an argument as to why you should buy them a gift. I hope you don\u2019t feel bad or guilty about this. You contributed WAY more than what constitutes a gift.", "OP you are a gracious person. Your sister is still a major AH. After seeing what you charge and heard you are losing  income she still did not offer to pay you something. She is entitled and horrid. Please do not help her again. She has money and can pay.", "Honestly fuck her still I\u2019d still be upset. You\u2019re too nice.", "NTA.  Sounds like she's getting married for the presents, not for love. Who insists on a gift??", "I\u2019m so glad that you were able to work things out. Family can be difficult, but in the end I think you handled this perfectly. \n\nPlease ignore anyone telling you that you should take some sort of extreme action like stopping the wedding planning or even cutting your sister off. Just because family is difficult doesn\u2019t mean we stop loving them or working on the relationship. Your sister has acted selfishly, but it sounds like she knows that now and will hopefully be more grateful moving forward. \n\nGood job to you. You did great.", "Sorry to see this update OP. \n\nI wish you well.", "Woah, back up the bud. Wedding registry is for gifts for the couple to start their new life, not designer handbags, clothes and shopping sprees. Wth", "Im more angry at sis than I was when I first read the original. \n\nShe's marrying into and is already apparently acclimated to big money...and instead of offering to pay OP full price or offering OP a nice gift for saving them $$, she STILL tried to connive OP into getting them a gift.  \n\nThat's a lot of audacity, and I'd have a sour taste lingering in mouth  for a long time after this.", "10/10", "Oh it's worse. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWedding planner must not be a good paying job, because op seems so poor. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, at the same time....she's all surely op gets paid enough that she's got major leisure savings account she can dip into. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow on earth can someone be poor and rich at the same time lady?", "agree", "The whole story sounds like the first 10 minutes of a rom com before the movie jumps forward a year or two. Husband is now filing for divorce and she learns the prenup she signed leaves her with only the clothes she's wearing that day.\n\nIt'll be mid at the box office but really find its audience when it hits streaming.", "I don't like the sister more", "And a second HOUSE!!!!", "The sister is literally out of her mind. Like let me add a whole house to my registry. In what world is that normal??\n\nEdit to add: I\u2019ve seen people ask for crazy things on registries before but never a whole ass house. Like WTF!", "&#x200B;\n\n>I always figured a wedding gift is for both the couple to use\n\nI'm sure the husband will get plenty of use out of a nice clutch, some pretty earrings and a cocktaildress. Top it off with a pair of pumps and he's set for date night ;)\n\nI'm not saying *she* is like that, but the registry has a serious \"my weddingday is about me...oh, I guess the groom can come too\" vibe.\n\n(Sorry if I'm offending anybody, I'm just in a very sarcastic mood today)", " After seeing what you charge and heard you are losing income she still did not offer to pay you something.", ">I mean designer clothes and handbags aren\u2019t that expensive, but she was still asking for things thousands of dollars a pop. \n\nSay what now. The things that you mentioned, designer clothes and handbags can be and often are thousands of dollars. Designer or custom high quality jewelry is the same.\n\nI think your point is correct - a wedding registry should be reflective of the newlyweds, but should also be reflective of those invited if they want a gift.\n\nWhen my partner and I got married, we asked for nothing except for our friends and family to celebrate with us and to this day we still get told we had one of the best weddings people had ever attended. We wanted to celebrate, not use it as a chance to extract fiscal value from those we care about.", "Who asks for those kind of things on a registry? It is to set up your home, not fill your closets.", "That's what I was going to say. Wtf. How can someone expect a wedding guest to gift them a car let alone a literal F'ing house. Just how outside of reality are these people.\n\nLike yeah just get us this small item worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, no biggy.\n\nI'd also agree most wedding stuff should be stuff the couple can use like small appliances or household stuff. \n\nI commented on the original post saying $200 should be a mid tier item not a bottom tier (my husband and I got married recently and did stuff from like $20-500 and never expected anyone to actually get the expensive stuff and most didn't. We mostly got cash which we used for our honeymoon and small things under $50.)\n\nI also have the experience of my sister helping me with my wedding by doing my hair and makeup and I never expected her to get me a gift and really wouldn't have even if she hadn't because I was just happy to have her there to share my \"big day\" with me. She saved me hundreds if not thousands of dollars. It was hours of time and years of built up skill. (She doesn't do it professionally but people often ask her if she is a makeup artist because honestly she's just that talented.)", "Wow some people are just greedy. The most expensive item gift I received was probably the stainless steel pots & pans set from my FIL", "Sorry but I thought the point of the gifts registry was for things the couples can use together? Like before it used to be for stuff to set up their new home, a designer handbag seems a bit cheeky", "When OP explained the whole thing to her bride backed off and apologized.  Bride also sent a group text saying things had been settled between them. Part of this stems from them living in different financial situations so the bride had unrealistic expectations. She admitted she was wrong and they were able to make peace.  I know some people wanted her her to charge full price to the bride, but if we can resolve things that can leave both sides satisfied including OP that should be it.  I actually think the family is worse than the bride because they should have been the ones to talk sense to her not enable her.", "No kidding! I cannot believe the OP actually had to bring this woman what amounts to his own pay stubbs from his previous jobs as \"proof\"!!!\n \nI think some of her audacity has got to stem from the fact that this guy is her little brother. LOL I just can't imagine being so rude to anyone but very close family...and even then. He's the younger sibling!!!", "When you say \"people like her\" do you mean entitled self centred sanctimonious individuals? Or am I looking at another post?", "Nope.  I know plenty of wealthy people, old and new money.  This is the sort of thing only reality stars do.", "So if all of that is \u201cnormal for people like her,\u201d why didn\u2019t she HIRE a wedding planner (you or someone else)? \n\nShe\u2019s a user. You\u2019ve lost out. She has sucked you dry. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, but please don\u2019t do this again for others you know.", "r/choosingbeggars", "It's definitely not normal for anyone.", "Unless it's stuff for the home, or maybe money towards a honeymoon, the whole list is insane. I would never think of putting purses or clothes for myself on any registry. It's like sister thinks the wedding can double as a birthday party or other gift giving parties where those are reasonable gifts.", " You contributed WAY more than what constitutes a gift.", "If she\u2019s that wealthy she doesn\u2019t need a registry - or at least not gifts from people who have normal incomes. Gifts for weddings were initially about helping a couple set up home, in the days when folk got married younger and mostly didn\u2019t live together first. When I got married we didn\u2019t need anything so asked for no gifts. They aren\u2019t compulsory!", "Glad it\u2019s resolved but totally shocked designer handbags would be on a wedding registry! \ud83d\ude33", "This lady needs an etiquette book.", "But I AM glad you did the numbers and gave her a reality check.", "When we were registering my wife questioned why we should register for the $75 4 slot toaster. Or the $20 pizza cutter.\n\nGranted we have bought a new toaster when our registers one died, but that pizza cutter is still going strong, nearly 20 years later. \n\nAnd my wife has used the mini Bundt cake pan a grand total of one time since we got it.", "No no, this is luxury audacity, handmade by artisans in Italy.
