Aswell as stating what I would normally charge for a wedding this sized. I then texted her to ask if we could get some lunch and talk.\n\nWhen she arrived I showed her the list and explained that I'm not asking her to pay this but I wanted her to see how much I'm helping her and how much money I am losing by doing her wedding instead of taking on a client who would pay. At first she was shocked at the amount and accused me of lying to try and make her feel bad, I was able to show her bills from other weddings I had done before and a quick Google search showed that my prices are pretty average, she had never looked up any wedding planner or their rates bc she assumed I was always gonna do it.\n\nShe said she thought it wasnt that much as I didnt seem to be well off, I told her that while it does pay well I cant take on crazy amounts of clients since I need to give quality service and that I might not always get clients all year, plus I have a few medical expenses that can take out a large chunk.\n\nShe said I still must have some money saved up, I said I do but that I would be having to use it to cover my bills and stuff since my income is taking a hit due to taking on her wedding, after a while of insisting that some of the items on her registry arnt that expensive she relented, I wouldn't have to get her anything since I had gotten her enough discounts to qualify as a gift and that she was grateful for my help and services.\n\nHonestly, I didnt know how much this was stressing me until that relief washed over me, I was thankful that this was over and we could continue with planning her wedding. I asked her to clear things up with our family as they wont talk to me about it, she agreed and sent a group text explaining that the gift incident was just a misunderstanding and that we had talked it out and cleared things up.\n\nFor those who are saying that her registry seems very expensive, her new husband, his family friends, and alot of her friend are very wealthy, and she makes sure our parents and other close family are taken care of so she kinds has become disconnected from people with \u201cnormal\u201d financial status like me. There are alot of things on the list like designer handbags, clothes, shopping sprees, dinners, and even a car and second home on there. The cheaper items are some simple jewelry she liked.\n\nShe paid for my part of the lunch as an apology and since I'm struggling and things are all good now I think, thanks, everyone.", "created_utc": 1685195203, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t7xuy/update_wibta_if_i_didnt_get_my_sister_a_wedding/", "score": 2270, "replies": [">She said she thought it wasnt that much **as I didnt seem to be well off**\n\nYet she still insisted on a wedding present in the first place?\n\n>after a while of insisting that some of the items on her registry arnt that expensive **she relented**\n\nWell, that was mighty big of her.\n\nGlad you reached a resolution and I hope that will be the end of the wedding drama. \n\nHave you had any apologies from the other family members?", "If you are happy, I am happy.

The things that you mentioned, designer clothes and handbags can be and often are thousands of dollars. Designer or custom high quality jewelry is the same.\n\nI think your point is correct - a wedding registry should be reflective of the newlyweds, but should also be reflective of those invited if they want a gift.\n\nWhen my partner and I got married, we asked for nothing except for our friends and family to celebrate with us and to this day we still get told we had one of the best weddings people had ever attended. We wanted to celebrate, not use it as a chance to extract fiscal value from those we care about.", "Who asks for those kind of things on a registry? It is to set up your home, not fill your closets.", "That's what I was going to say. Wtf. How can someone expect a wedding guest to gift them a car let alone a literal F'ing house. Just how outside of reality are these people.\n\nLike yeah just get us this small item worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, no biggy.\n\nI'd also agree most wedding stuff should be stuff the couple can use like small appliances or household stuff. \n\nI commented on the original post saying $200 should be a mid tier item not a bottom tier (my husband and I got married recently and did stuff from like $20-500 and never expected anyone to actually get the expensive stuff and most didn't. We mostly got cash which we used for our honeymoon and small things under $50.)\n\nI also have the experience of my sister helping me with my wedding by doing my hair and makeup and I never expected her to get me a gift and really wouldn't have even if she hadn't because I was just happy to have her there to share my \"big day\" with me. She saved me hundreds if not thousands of dollars. It was hours of time and years of built up skill.

The most expensive item gift I received was probably the stainless steel pots & pans set from my FIL", "Sorry but I thought the point of the gifts registry was for things the couples can use together?

I know some people wanted her her to charge full price to the bride, but if we can resolve things that can leave both sides satisfied including OP that should be it.
