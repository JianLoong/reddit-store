Aswell as stating what I would normally charge for a wedding this sized. I then texted her to ask if we could get some lunch and talk.\n\nWhen she arrived I showed her the list and explained that I'm not asking her to pay this but I wanted her to see how much I'm helping her and how much money I am losing by doing her wedding instead of taking on a client who would pay. At first she was shocked at the amount and accused me of lying to try and make her feel bad, I was able to show her bills from other weddings I had done before and a quick Google search showed that my prices are pretty average, she had never looked up any wedding planner or their rates bc she assumed I was always gonna do it.\n\nShe said she thought it wasnt that much as I didnt seem to be well off, I told her that while it does pay well I cant take on crazy amounts of clients since I need to give quality service and that I might not always get clients all year, plus I have a few medical expenses that can take out a large chunk.\n\nShe said I still must have some money saved up, I said I do but that I would be having to use it to cover my bills and stuff since my income is taking a hit due to taking on her wedding, after a while of insisting that some of the items on her registry arnt that expensive she relented, I wouldn't have to get her anything since I had gotten her enough discounts to qualify as a gift and that she was grateful for my help and services.\n\nHonestly, I didnt know how much this was stressing me until that relief washed over me, I was thankful that this was over and we could continue with planning her wedding. I asked her to clear things up with our family as they wont talk to me about it, she agreed and sent a group text explaining that the gift incident was just a misunderstanding and that we had talked it out and cleared things up.\n\nFor those who are saying that her registry seems very expensive, her new husband, his family friends, and alot of her friend are very wealthy, and she makes sure our parents and other close family are taken care of so she kinds has become disconnected from people with \u201cnormal\u201d financial status like me. There are alot of things on the list like designer handbags, clothes, shopping sprees, dinners, and even a car and second home on there. The cheaper items are some simple jewelry she liked.\n\nShe paid for my part of the lunch as an apology and since I'm struggling and things are all good now I think, thanks, everyone.", "created_utc": 1685195203, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13t7xuy/update_wibta_if_i_didnt_get_my_sister_a_wedding/", "score": 75, "replies": [">She said she thought it wasnt that much **as I didnt seem to be well off**\n\nYet she still insisted on a wedding present in the first place?\n\n>after a while of insisting that some of the items on her registry arnt that expensive **she relented**\n\nWell, that was mighty big of her.\n\nGlad you reached a resolution and I hope that will be the end of the wedding drama. \n\nHave you had any apologies from the other family members?", "If you are happy, I am happy. I think that\u2019s it.", "She thought your work wasn\u2019t worth much because you are poor, so she expected you to do it for free, and *also* come up with money for a gift? Glad you set her straight, OP.", "She has a designer purse and a vacation home on her wedding registry? \ud83e\udd28", "Thank you for the update. It sounds like a good solution. Nice for you and also your sister.", "I do not buy the \u201cdisconnected from normal financial status\u201d line. If she\u2019s that affluent she would have heard plenty of bragging on how much other had spent on their weddings. It becomes a pissing contest who can put on the biggest show. She is just incredibly greedy. I mean even after all of that explanation she had the nerve to question your savings ?!? She sounds awful.", "You did the absolutely best thing one can do: you reached out and had a conversation. Well done.\n\nI would keep my distance from that person in the future though. The conversation showed you she had grown distant enough from \"average\" people to cause issues. Accusing you of lying and having you show receipts was awful. Network at the wedding, fish for good clients, and then put it behind you and hang out with less stressful people. Best of luck with your health.", "You should use that sister to network and get higher paying clients OP.", "Good heavens. This lady needs an etiquette book. It's very sad that she's using her wedding as a money grab - doesn't bode well for the marriage. Hope the wedding goes smoothly and that you never plan for free ever again! Get that bread!", "I remember your post. I\u2019m glad you were able to work things out for the sake of your family but your sister is still a massive AH and terribly entitled. Not if but WHEN she gets married again, put your foot down as to planning the wedding and get her a toaster.", "At last the update!!!!!\n\nI\u2019m glad it worked out for you and while your sister sounds like an axe wound, it sounds like you got the resolution you wanted and it\u2019s a weight off of you.", "Glad it\u2019s resolved but totally shocked designer handbags would be on a wedding registry! \ud83d\ude33", "I\u2019m actually glad you didn\u2019t do what I suggested in my comment on your post. Some of us just enjoy living our petty fantasies through this sub and that was one of those moments. \n\nBut I AM glad you did the numbers and gave her a reality check. She needed to really see what you were actually gifting her so she could fully appreciate what you have done for her. Well done OP!", "Did you get the part where she asks for a second home or a car on her registry? \n\nI mean designer clothes and handbags aren\u2019t that expensive, but she was still asking for things thousands of dollars a pop. Even jewelry is a couple hundred for a piece. And I always figured a wedding gift is for both the couple to use, even though one or two items may favor one side or the other.", "I second this very sweet comment.", "she dose, its kinda insane to me at least but she insisted it was normal for \"people like her\"", "Ikr!  WTAF \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "nouveau riche", ">it was normal for \"people like her\"\n\nPeople who buy their audacity wholesale at Costco?", "Lmao it's not.\n\nUltra wealthy parents or grandparents may gift a couple their first home or similar but random guests, even among uber wealthy, are not gifting real estate.\n\nEven designer bags are really, really gauche. \n\nShe doesn't know what she thinks she does.\n\nIt's actually funny.", "I'm curious about the second home. Did she have listings for properties she liked? Can I ask how much they were"]}
