We told our family the news, and told them the baby names we had picked: Violet for a girl, and Carson for a boy. We unfortunately lost the baby in the second trimester. Then we experienced two more miscarriages (both in the first trimester), and went through a couple more rounds of failed IVF. It was a very difficult and traumatic time for us.\n\nWe visited my family over the 2022 winter holidays, and my sister announced that she was pregnant. I was genuinely happy for her, until she told us the names they\u2019d chosen: Violet for a girl, Carson for a boy. I took her aside and told her that I was very happy for her pregnancy, but hurt and confused that she would choose our baby names, especially with everything we've been through. And she basically said, \u201cdon\u2019t try to pull the miscarriage card on me, you can\u2019t call dibs on a name.\u201d\n\nI tried talking to her a couple more times about it, but each time she\u2019d say things like \u201cyou might never have kids, you can\u2019t just keep those names in reserve forever,\u201d and was just so hurtful. I stopped bringing it up for the sake of keeping the peace, and after a few months she told my parents she wasn\u2019t going to use either of those names. But wouldn\u2019t tell anybody what name they HAD chosen.\n\nFast forward to a couple months ago, and she gave birth to her baby girl: Violetta Karsyn. And I\u2019m just so hurt.\n\nI found out in the early spring that I'm pregnant, and I'm far enough along now that the doctors feel pretty good about everything, and we let our families know last month. My mom and her friends have planned a baby shower, but I told her I do not want my sister invited. My mom said I\u2019m being an AH for not inviting her over the baby name, but at this point it\u2019s not even about the name to me anymore. It\u2019s the malicious comments, the lack of compassion, and the overall pettiness.  \n\n\nSo tell me, good people of Reddit: Am I the asshole for not inviting my sister to my baby shower?  \n\n\n(For further context, prior to this my sister and I were decent terms.

My gut reaction to this was that she was somehow jealous of the attention you had received for your many devastating losses and in a warped way was baiting you into starting a fight so that she could be the victim for once and have people feel sorry for her instead of you.

I\u2019m sorry this has taken away from your experience as a mother-to-be, but your beautiful rainbow baby will have an equally beautiful name and it will feel absolutely meant for them once you hold them in your arms.", "NTA.

But it doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t real to OP and her husband.\n\nTo me, her sister choosing those names show her lack of taste and class. She deliberately chose names that have painful connotations for her sister.

I could understand the situation more if there was any kind of family significance to these names, but it really just boiled down to liking the names.
