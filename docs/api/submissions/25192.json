My gut reaction to this was that she was somehow jealous of the attention you had received for your many devastating losses and in a warped way was baiting you into starting a fight so that she could be the victim for once and have people feel sorry for her instead of you.

If she says she did not do then say \"But you knew that was the name I had chosen for my little one before I miscarried. Surely you would not have just taken the name without asking?\" and again have your friends add that as well. Fight fire with fire. But then I tend to go scorched earth.", "NTA. No one \"owns\" a name and your sister had the right to select any name she wanted to for her daughter (although I pity the little girl having to live with Violetta Karsyn simply because her mother is a competitive b\\*tch). \n\nOn the other hand, you are not obligated to invite a person who has intentionally insulted you in multiple ways to any of your social events going forward. Tell your mother that if your sister is invited then you will not attend. No baby shower is worth that kind of aggravation.", "NTA, but you can still use those names. Cousins can have the same name. If it\u2019s a girl, you can use Violet and perhaps have a nickname picked out, and there\u2019s no problem using Carson since people don\u2019t get called by their middle names. If you can feel less like she \u201cstole\u201d the names, and you can still use them, maybe you won\u2019t care as much about letting her come to the baby shower?

Your sister is a sadistic person who needs therapy. I would go LC or NC with her.

It sounds like she favors your sister and is blind to the toxic behavior (perhaps she is like this too?). \n\nYou're right that it's not about names. It's about intentionally cruel, meanspirited behavior designed to hurt and destroy you. The \"you might never have children, so you can't keep the names reserved\" comment is particularly awful. And again, it's not about the names themselves and who uses them, it's about her complete lack of empathy, her going out of her way to hurt you when you were at your most vulnerable, and the fact that others, including your own mother choose to ignore her hurtful behavior and worse, back her up. I would ask neutral members of the family what they think (what does her husband say?, are your husband and hers on good terms?) and I would speak to a professional. Good luck and congratulations on the baby! (I had an somewhat similar situation with my SIL and although she never saw meanspirited, insecure behavior for what it was and our relationship never improved, my baby (now in high school) gave my husband and I enormous joy and she became just a \"blip\" on our radar that we had to endure every once and awhile.

Baby names should not be used to 'one up' siblings, especially siblings who have had multiple miscarriages.

She didn't pick the kids name out of love for her new child, which honestly is one of the most sad parts about all this. She used her child to hurt you. A literal baby.

I didn\u2019t notice until after we grew up; she got a dog the DAY AFTER I posted on social media that I was sad I couldn\u2019t afford to take care of one. It made me realize how many times it had happened before. The worst was when we went to MY bridal appointment, before we had even checked in, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s funny, you got ENGAGED before me, but I\u2019m gonna get MARRIED before you.\u201d She wasn\u2019t even engaged yet, but her bf was planning on joining the military and she was dead set on having the wedding before he left for basic training. (He did propose and they did marry before me, effectively putting my own plans on hold in order to help her because her wedding was only 3 months away and I had a whole year \ud83d\ude44) Our friendship crumbled when I got pregnant. Her husband didn\u2019t want a baby yet, and she was butthurt that I was finally doing something before her. I have no doubt in my mind that she would have done the exact same thing as your sister if she had gotten the chance, and I\u2019m sorry to say it probably won\u2019t get better.

My sister and I sat by the pool and when I shared the name I was wanting to use if it was a girl, my sister got upset and said that was the name that she wanted for a girl (Faith).

She wasn\u2019t taking any chances that OP might have a boy, she had to make sure both names were off the table.

Which, whatever, still a dick move.", "Just similar enough so OP can\u2019t use either of them.  It wasn\u2019t enough just to use Violetta, she had to take the boy\u2019s name too!

I go by a nickname predominately & there was zero issues between sisters.

So underrated.", "Ii was hoping this was the reason.

Preferably if your background is Spanish or Italian, it makes more sense then. (Not that you can't give your kid an ethnic name if you're not of that ethnicity, it just always strikes me as a little... desperate?) \n\nBut not in this case. And DEFINITELY not with Karsyn as a middle name. Ew. \n\nSome named just mark you out for the rest of your life as low-class, pretty much any name variation with a Y in it will get you there in my opinion.", "I know, but I was thinking more of the names in combination, espesially with the spelling of the second one...

The poor kid", "Violetta is lovely in literally every other situation where you're not doing it to be a giant B to your sister.\n\n(Which I'm sure you agree with, not calling you out, just... so disgusted by this one.)\n\nAnd Karsyn is peak r/tragedeigh territory.", "What dead cousin? OP was planning to use those names , not that she used them", "Absolutely agree! \n\nJust meant that Violetta as a name on it's own is lovely. Not in this context though. And sounds bad when combined with Karsyn not matter how you spell it in my opinion.", "the one who died in the second trimester", "But OP was planning to still use both those names so she either didn't name that baby or named them something elae", "I didn\u2019t read it that way \ud83e\udd14\n\nif OP did that, that would be pretty weird tbh \ud83d\ude10"]}
