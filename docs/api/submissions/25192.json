My gut reaction to this was that she was somehow jealous of the attention you had received for your many devastating losses and in a warped way was baiting you into starting a fight so that she could be the victim for once and have people feel sorry for her instead of you.

Turn that back on her. \"Oh yes I am so happy that you agreed to use the name I gave you\" and have a few of your friends (tell them ahead of time) start agreeing. If she says she did not do then say \"But you knew that was the name I had chosen for my little one before I miscarried. Surely you would not have just taken the name without asking?\" and again have your friends add that as well. Fight fire with fire. But then I tend to go scorched earth.", "NTA. No one \"owns\" a name and your sister had the right to select any name she wanted to for her daughter (although I pity the little girl having to live with Violetta Karsyn simply because her mother is a competitive b\\*tch). \n\nOn the other hand, you are not obligated to invite a person who has intentionally insulted you in multiple ways to any of your social events going forward. Tell your mother that if your sister is invited then you will not attend. No baby shower is worth that kind of aggravation.", "NTA, but you can still use those names. Cousins can have the same name. If it\u2019s a girl, you can use Violet and perhaps have a nickname picked out, and there\u2019s no problem using Carson since people don\u2019t get called by their middle names. If you can feel less like she \u201cstole\u201d the names, and you can still use them, maybe you won\u2019t care as much about letting her come to the baby shower?

Your sister is a sadistic person who needs therapy. I would go LC or NC with her.

It sounds like she favors your sister and is blind to the toxic behavior (perhaps she is like this too?). \n\nYou're right that it's not about names. It's about intentionally cruel, meanspirited behavior designed to hurt and destroy you. The \"you might never have children, so you can't keep the names reserved\" comment is particularly awful. And again, it's not about the names themselves and who uses them, it's about her complete lack of empathy, her going out of her way to hurt you when you were at your most vulnerable, and the fact that others, including your own mother choose to ignore her hurtful behavior and worse, back her up. I would ask neutral members of the family what they think (what does her husband say?, are your husband and hers on good terms?) and I would speak to a professional. Good luck and congratulations on the baby!

She didn't pick the kids name out of love for her new child, which honestly is one of the most sad parts about all this. She used her child to hurt you. A literal baby.

I didn\u2019t notice until after we grew up; she got a dog the DAY AFTER I posted on social media that I was sad I couldn\u2019t afford to take care of one. It made me realize how many times it had happened before. The worst was when we went to MY bridal appointment, before we had even checked in, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s funny, you got ENGAGED before me, but I\u2019m gonna get MARRIED before you.\u201d She wasn\u2019t even engaged yet, but her bf was planning on joining the military and she was dead set on having the wedding before he left for basic training. (He did propose and they did marry before me, effectively putting my own plans on hold in order to help her because her wedding was only 3 months away and I had a whole year \ud83d\ude44) Our friendship crumbled when I got pregnant. Her husband didn\u2019t want a baby yet, and she was butthurt that I was finally doing something before her. I have no doubt in my mind that she would have done the exact same thing as your sister if she had gotten the chance, and I\u2019m sorry to say it probably won\u2019t get better.

My sister and I sat by the pool and when I shared the name I was wanting to use if it was a girl, my sister got upset and said that was the name that she wanted for a girl (Faith).

I don't even know you and I don't want her there this time and she did that to herself - if they don't understand, simply, 'I don't want to be reminded of the little ones that deserved a happy life with us but didn't make it on a day that I should be very happy celebrating.' if anyone argues with that, ignore it they're wrong and they don't get it.\n\nIt's one thing to want to honor you with the name but it doesn't seem like that was her intention and Im sorry your sister did this to you.", "Blessings for a wonderful pregnancy. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA.
