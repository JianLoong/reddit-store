At the very worst, daughter totals her car, gets stuck in the snowstorm(ditch, etc), kills another person, or gets killed. I\u2019m not a parent but I wouldn\u2019t take those odds.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how good of a drive anyone is. A car is one of the most dangerous things on this planet. That\u2019s because you have to trust that every person around you also driving is competent. Majority of the time, crashes are caused by people being idiots.\n\nWhen I was in high school I listened to my parents. Was it annoying sometimes? Yes. Am I grateful to them? Absolutely. My parents imposed a curfew on the 4th of July. I was to be home no later than 10:30PM. Wanna know why? Because of drunk drivers.

My wife\u2019s parents were trapped in their house. Even my boss, who \u201cgrew up in Michigan\u201d made it a mile down his road before he nearly wrecked and noped his ass back home.

There will be other parties", "NAH\n\nWhen I had my permit and the test for my license was a month away, a nasty snowstorm blew through. Our roads were some of the last to be plowed, so Dad took me out to drive in the snow. First we went out in his car, and he instructed me to go no faster than 5mph and then gently tap the brakes. I did and felt the *grrnmm-grrnmm-grrnmm* that Dad explained was the ABS working against the ice and snow.\n\nThen we took out Mom's car, which didn't have ABS (this was 2009), still going 5mph, and dad instructed me to tap the brakes. I *immediately* spun out, but since we were only going 5mph, I was able to correct the spinout. Dad was calmly explaining the difference while I sat shaking in the driver's seat having watched my very short life pass before my eyes.\n\nThat one lesson made me an incredibly cautious snow driver, and despite all my caution, I *still* spun out on black ice that even the ABS couldn't stop. My car smacked a guard rail twice and even though I was belted, the post-concussive symptoms from the whiplash took years to clear. It could have been so much worse.\n\nYour daughter is a teenager. Her brain is still trying to develop the ability to understand things without having experienced them personally. Car accidents are \"things that happen to someone else\" because she doesn't get that we are all someone else to someone else.\n\nSo if you have back roads in your area that aren't well-trafficked and don't get plowed, maybe one of you can take her out in the ice and ask her to hit the brakes at 5-10mph. Because all it took for me was the feel of that small spinout to know that *nothing* was worth the risk of willingly driving on ice.", "NTA first off.   \n\n\nShare this one with your daughter: My mom used to make me stay home any time it was Friday the 13th. Literally I wasn't allowed to do anything or go anywhere. She'd even ask my sister and I to skip school. Now that's insane.   \n\n\nHaving your daughter stay home during a snow storm is reasonable if she's a new driver.  \n\n\nAlso her friends parents ARE TA for not allowing a few friends to spend the night in these conditions.", "NAH-is there any way she can spend the night with the friend? I absolutely understand why your daughter is so upset, but you have every right to be concerned about the dangerous road conditions.\n\nI agree with other commenters saying that you should tell her you guys can play it by ear with the weather, but make sure you let her know the firm boundary of if roads are like x or y you cannot go.\n\nAlso get your husband in on this conversation.

You did make a promise, and you cannot protect her from all risk. She's in danger every time she sets foot in a vehicle.

I wouldn't have figured it out at her age either, especially as a novice driver. Not her fault for not understanding, either. But you are right in not letting her go if the roads are going to be bad. Better have a pissed off but safe daughter then have something happen to her out there. And I'm certain other parents of the kids feel the same.", "NAH\n\nShe\u2019s understandably upset.

I think you're being very careful during dangerous weather after listening to the advice of people that know what they're talking about, but I also think it's understandable that your daughter is disappointed because she's been so excited. Had the offer of staying over there been an option, I'm sure you would have considered it more but the fact of the matter is that her only choice if she went would be to drive alone in the dark, when the conditions are dicey at best. You did the right thing but she's allowed to be upset. Try and talk to her when she's calmed down a bit and explain your reasoning and maybe suggest doing something special that night, like a favourite meal and a movie marathon. It's not the same as a party but hopefully it'll take her mind off of it for a while. And when the weather starts turning for the worse, I hope she'll realise you made the right choice.", "NTA\n\nI live in an area that seems to get more ice then snow. After driving 25 winters I stay home especially when I\u2019m advised to stay home. If the weather turns out that bad will they cancel the party?

Sometimes parents have to make decisions their kids aren\u2019t fond of, this one, but it\u2019s a reasonable one to make.\n\nI was that angry kid once upon a time, as I live in an area with these kinds of advisories in winter. I wasn\u2019t happy about it, but now I understand it more. \n\nNormal snowy weather here often includes 15cm of snow, so when the weather reports have issue a severe advisory, we know it\u2019s going to be more than that, or it\u2019s going to include freezing rain, or other treacherous conditions. After 20+ years driving in the winter here, I still don\u2019t FAAFO with bad weather - even though I drive according to conditions, in a truck with 4x4 and winter tires. I don\u2019t want to get hurt, or hurt someone else, and I definitely don\u2019t want to have sit in -15\u00b0C for hours waiting for a tow truck to bail me out (because in bad weather, those poor drivers are BUSY). \n\nIn saying all that though, I\u2019d wait and see what the weather actually does, as it can change, and sometimes the predictions are wrong.

But as someone who DID learn how to drive in the winter in the midwest, it can get very dangerous very fast. I've had experiences spinning out and fishtailing all over the place while driving in the snow and ice, it's very scary and your daughter is almost certainly underestimating how terrifying it feels to lose control of your car. Living in a place with snow means plans are always at the mercy of the weather- my family has canceled Christmas before because of bad roads.

By the time I was supposed to go home, mom didn't feel it would be safe to try driving down our crazy steep one-lane mountain road, halfway across the county, up another steep one-lane mountain road, and back at night. It was decided that I would spend the night and my friend's dad would drive me home in the morning since he'd have his big beastly work truck. Morning came and we were headed home when the unexpected ice storm hit. We made it to the bottom of my mountain when he legit could not drive me any further, and couldn't stay because if he waited too long he wouldn't be able to get back up his own mountain. I decided that since we'd already made it most of the way, I'd just hoof it since I had worn boots and knew no one would be out on the road. So I walked 4 miles up the mountain in an ice storm to get home because whatever, and mom was in the middle of a panic attack when I came in because the last she had heard from me was I was about to start the drive home almost 5 hours and an ice storm ago and she thought I was dead off a cliff somewhere along the way and my corpse wouldn't be found for weeks.", "Looks like they have now according to an update.", "Not necessarily.\n\nIf the party and most of the expected attendees are in a dense area where most people can get there by walking or public transit, then continuing with it should be ok.

Distance doesn't have to be a variable but it is in this case. When it comes to icy roads you can get into an accident sliding out of your own driveway, let alone on a 30 minute drive.

About a decade ago, we got hit by what the UK would consider a pretty average storm and it was all over the news for like a week. I saw people with t-shirts saying they'd \"survived the great storm\", lol. In fairness, the city was completely unprepared for that kind of weather event, so it caused a lot of damage.\n\nBy the same token, most Brits don't understand how dangerous super hot weather can be.

The SUV ended up partially buried. All four were found dead the next day. \n\nMy grandpa was a paramedic and got a hold of the accident report. Two died on impact. One either died of his injuries or suffocated. The other tried to dig himself out, but died of exposure and carbon monoxide poisoning. \n\nThey were 17 or 18. At the time, the license age in Idaho was 14.

Beats me, the weather's usually in the 80s on Christmas.", "I mean, southern states literally don't have the equipment to clear the roads. They go out and spray the overpasses when ice is expected, but nobody has the experience in it here. It's truly, truly rare for a whole road to be icy. And snow tires aren't a thing. Everyone runs all seasons all year round.", "Someone said OP edited the post - the parents canceled the party and are rescheduling it.  So I guess it really is a NAH.", "Exactly!  We came from NYC and now live in a town in the South that has no slow plows.  Who knew a coating of ice can shut things down for 5 days?! They don't even prep the roads for storms.

There were also a bunch of neighbors living up there, most of them we knew from school or church so if it got really bad I could have easily stopped at one of their houses on my way. The longest stretch of road without a driveway was only about a mile and that wasn't until you got to the top of the ridge and turned on to our road. It wasn't dangerously cold, there wasn't any wind to speak of, and I was dressed appropriately for a winter hike. \n\nI was also 17 and had been traipsing over every inch of that mountain for most of my life and knew it like the back of my hand. It's not like he shoved an unprepared 10yo out of his truck and said \"hope you survive!\". It was slow going, but it wasn't like I was unprepared in an unknown location. If I had to make the choice to walk up his mountain or turn around, I would have opted to turn around, but since it was my mountain I wasn't terribly worried. But I was 17 so the only thing I didn't consider when deciding to walk was how bad my mom would be panicking when I was hours later than expected.", "Makes me glad to live fairly rural. Our pile ups where I live are only max 4 cars. Of course we trade that off by the possibility of going off cliffs that are hundreds of feet down.
