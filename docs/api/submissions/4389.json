If it is okay enough, then I would suggest you drive her.", "NTA.

I'm livid at the YTA comments who expected you to risk both of your lives to drive her to and from a *party*. People die in these conditions every year so I can't grasp why you would ignore a warning from EMTs not to go on the roads unless absolutely necessary. \n\nNot every setback in life that comes your way was directly aimed at you, and it's time your daughter learns that.

As someone who lives in a northern state, I\u2019ve had to cancel things I wanted to do because of weather. It\u2019s disappointing, but it happens.\n\nJust because roads are legally open doesn\u2019t mean you should be on them.", "Sounds like they don\u2019t feel comfortable driving in those conditions either", "Arbitrary? Safety is not arbitrary.", "Look, I\u2019ve been driving in snow longer north of 20 years now in a place that gets lots of snow. Just because roads are open does not mean you should be on them if you don\u2019t have to be. \n\nThe OP has said in an edit and multiple times in the comments that authorities are recommending that you stay off the roads if you don\u2019t need to be there. A party is not a need. Getting an Uber or having the mother drive doesn\u2019t change that. Though the OP doesn\u2019t say where she is, but there is a major snow event happening in the US. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s it. \n\nI feel for the kid. I\u2019ve been disappointed to miss events due to weather. But as a mother of a teen, I\u2019d probably make the same decision.", "So? Why wait until it's an issue instead of preventing the issue?", "but it's on it's way", "So you drive her. if th\u00e9 problem is the number of cars available: daughter drives you both, you stay over and talk to other parents/ drive to a nearby starbucks to read a book, and daughter drives you back after a couple of hours. \n\nThe lack of exploring other options comes across as \u201clemme find an excuse to keep my daughter from going to this party\u2026..\u201d weather is unpredictable. Other drivers are too. You\u2019re not wrong for being terrified, but the answer isn\u2019t to keep your daughter from experiencing life- it\u2019s to find a safe and responsible solution that gets both of you what you want. \n\nWhat time is the party? How far away is the drive? What kind of roads? Does your town salt roads when you\u2019re expecting bad weather? When\u2019s the snow supposed to start? Do you live in a state the frequently sees snow? If so, when will your daughter be allowed to drive in it? Other Redditors who suggested moving curfew up or having her leave when the snow starts probably had the best option here.", "I try to respect what road crews and first responders say about being on the road. They are advising unless it is essential to be on the roads to stay off them.", "Yes. Her rules are arbitrary. Not sure where she lives but there are parts of the world where it snows off and on for six or more months out of the year. If you won\u2019t drive in snow, you can\u2019t hold down a job. She has an opportunity to teach her daughter to drive in snow, which is an important skill.", "I get your perspective. :)", "There\u2019s a difference between \u201cstate of emergency \u201c closures when only certain people can be on the road and \u201cgee it\u2019s icy \u201c. I think a state of emergency is a fair reason but what road crew are you polling here? This feels like an excuse", "You're doing the right thing. Please ignore these judgemental people expecting you to risk life and limb for a party.", "How far is it? Does your town now have the equipment to handle snow?", "Just because a state of emergency isn\u2019t declared doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe to be on the roads, even if you\u2019re legally allowed to be.\n\nI don\u2019t know where OP is or what the weather will be, but if the message is don\u2019t drive unless you have to, stay home. Yeah, it sucks to miss something you want to do,but that happens sometimes. As someone who lives in the great north, I\u2019ve had to skip things I\u2019ve wanted to do because of the weather, even if I was allowed to drive.", "An excuse? When the EMTs said to stay off the roads and i drove, I totalled my car. They don't need excuses to get you off the road, and OP doesn't need excuses to want to believe them.", "Do you actually understand how ridiculous you sound? \"Just ignore the warnings so a17 year old can go to a party\"."]}
