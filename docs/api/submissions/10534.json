You failed as an aunt and uncle, put a neon sign in front of your niece's face showing how little you care about or respect her, and irreparably damaged your relationship with your brother.

You're awfully fragile.\n\nAt the most, you should have waited for your brother to return, told her what happened, and said she would not be welcome to stay with you again until she apologizes and promises to follow your house rules.\n\nDumping her on her mom without your brother's permission was way, way, way out of line.

They trusted you to take care of their daughter and you completely ignored that. Holy crap.", "Yes, you are a huge asshole for this.\n\nIf you agree to look after a child, you are agreeing to everything a child entails - if that's a 13-year-old, that means extremely defiant behavior, including rudeness and refusing to follow rules.\n\nYou cannot simply abandon that child because they \"don't follow rules\". You've already agreed that they're not going to follow rules by agreeing to take on a 13-year-old.\n\nThe sheer level of arrogance, mental fragility, and a lack of appreciation of social contact you showed when you pawned her off for being a 13-year-old is staggering. Absolutely staggering. The mentality \"if it's unpleasant to me I won't endure it, even if I agreed to it\" is about as loathsome a trait as a person can possess, which only makes it worse for being an acquired rather than an innate trait.", "Sorry, YTA. I get teenagers can be difficult, but you can't break a promise to your brother to take care of his child. Especially after only three days. \n\nYou gave a 13-year-old away like it was a toy you were bored of, meanwhile breaking a parenting contract. That it's simply not acceptable. \n\nI understand you thought at that time you were doing the right thing for everybody and didn't mean to hurt anyone. You did still really hurt people, so a \"sorry I messed up and completely misjudged the situation and end up breaking your trust\" would be in place.", "YTA.\n\nYour brother has primary custody.

But I call bullshit. \n\nI would legit have a hard time ever speaking to you again. I wouldn\u2019t even pawn off a dog I was sitting for\u2026let alone a kid.

You aren\u2019t supposed to give the kids away. \n\nThe fact that you haven\u2019t even apologized, and are so oblivious to why your behavior is unacceptable is the scariest part.

Now she's learned she can't trust or depend on you and your wife because at the first sign of trouble, you bailed. And you sent her to her mom's who, at best, is cold and unloving toward her. You think that doesn't mess with her head, to be reminded that her own mother doesn't want her around except to visit? No wonder she was in tears. \n\nYeah, you're the AH here. Hugely. For hurting your niece AND for disregarding your brother's wishes.", "YTA \n\nCongrats - you just taught your niece that if she doesn\u2019t behave, she\u2019ll be literally abandoned.

You are absolutely the asshole. You abandoned a child you agreeded to care for with out informing the adult you made the agreement with?

How could you expect that to go well?", "YTA.\n\nYou are adults...you agreed to help out and then didn't shoulder the responsibility.

You can't just pawn her off onto someone else when things get difficult. And at thirteen years old, I guarantee that she's more than old enough to understand that her mother wants very little to do with her, but you forced her to go there anyway. Can you not see how painful it probably was, for a child to spend time with a mother who doesn't want them?", "YTA and if my brother pulled this shit, I'd have knocked his teeth out . He obviously chose you as he didn't want to choose her.", "YTA - you agreed to watch a teenager and give up after just a few days because they're acting like a teenager? Seriously?

I hope you never have kids of your own because this is such irresponsible behavior.", "listen dude, I hope you will reconsider this attitude once you have kids. Teenagers are supposed to behave stupidly and test boundaries, adults are supposed to EDUCATE THEM. Ok? You sent her away, it does not matter that she was rude or did not respect the rules, you have to teach her the way to behave and live in a society. \nYTA and I am very sorry for you, because this concept somehow eludes you.", "YTA.

The kid was acting out, deal with it like adults.", "YTA you made an agreement to watch your niece! What would you have done if you couldn't reach the mother? Found some other relative to dump her on? You're (supposedly) an adult, but you acted as petulantly as the teenager you were responsible for, made her feel unwanted/unloved, and you violated a legal parenting contract on top of it.

And before I get attacked, I don\u2019t know this situation. I don\u2019t know what was going on that caused her to act out the way she did and I think that that needs to be addressed so she can be helped because it sounds like something is going on for her to have a complete behavior switch. And no matter what, OP shouldn\u2019t have sent her away. I just disagree with the generalization that \u201coh she\u2019s a teen they can be rude and defiant\u201d", "To be fair, OP didn't specify how many times they tried to contact the brother or how long.", "Except OP doesn't specify anything about how many times they tried to reach him. Like was it \"I called and texted multiple times over several days but he didn't get back to me\" or \"I called him once and he didn't pick up immediately and I didn't bother trying again\". Reading OP's replies and them avoiding that question I'm leaning towards the latter.\n\n\nFurther depending on where brother goes being incommunicado wholly or in part might be unavoidable, there aren't mobile reception everywhere, which shocks city dwellers but there you are. That said, since brother being unavailable would then be expected steps should have been taken  before he left in addressing how to deal with unexpected situations where getting in touch with him would be needed.", "There are absolutely jobs out there that make you unreachable during the day.\n\nAnd it sounds like during that one day was the only time OP even tried, as the daughter was supposed to stay for 7 days, of ugh they were 3 days in, and was asking the daughter's mother to watch the kid for 4 days.", "If a dad had one day a month visitation, I absolutely would say the exact same thing. \n\nWhere is she 100% full mom?

There's a reason the mom wasn't looking after the niece in the first place.", "It\u2019s her mom who only has visitation (which means no overnights), and who treats her coldly. Being forced to stay with her for several days could have absolutely been bad for that child\u2019s well-being. Just because someone is a mom doesn\u2019t mean they are good for the child.", "Then I cant say as to whether or not you may have just lost your brother a whole lot of support for his kid, but it's still possible. \n Still YTA. A teen was being a teen. And you were good just leaving the kid with someone who has made it abundantly clear they didn't want her. Had mom wanted her she wouldn't have asked for visitation only. This is likely gonna hurt your relationship to the kid, who you claim you love. And you clearly did not think through any repercussions past \"I said I'd watch her, but she acting out so I'm just gonna nope out\" Teens test boundaries, it's part of the teenage independence process. She thought she was somewhere safe to test her boundaries. She got taught once she's a little difficult, you're gonna get rid of her.

If I called the ex to finish out time I promised, I\u2019d be dead to that family member.  It\u2019s important in light of the courts to just get the kid out of the bad situation.  So you make arrangements and get the custody.   If she willingly gave up custody it\u2019s not a situation you put the kid in. \nThe brother might not share the details because that can be seen as alienation of the other parent.  I personally want to order billboards, to out the family\u2019s ex I know.\nSome moms just don\u2019t want to be a mom. And when they\u2019ve hit their limit, they make bad decisions.

Or is that just for women?\n\nYou have no idea what their relationship is like. It's very likely that the custody agreement even stipulates that each parents have a right to take the kid before any babysitter. Dad is also probably obligated to report any issues regarding the kid with the mom so it's only normal for her to be informed that her daughter is out there telling her aunt to fuck off. If she's \"colder\" than the dad, she might be the perfect parent to address this problem.\n\nHer rights have not been restricted or terminated.

Courts love custody agreements made between the parents and rarely mess with them.", "SERIOUSLY. It is possible OP means that the mother WANTED this custody agreement but regardless you don't send a kid to a parent they have a poor relationship with because the 13 year old is acting like a 13 year old.", "Also, most courts give the non-custodial parent \u201cright of first refusal\u201d for babysitting in standard agreements, meaning if I need someone to watch my kid during my custody time, my ex has to be asked if she wants to do it.  Once she says no, then I move down the list.\n\nThat the mother wasn\u2019t the first asked babysitter is telling\u2026", "Parents who ask for limited visitation get it though as long as the other parent is also cool with it.", "Yes. Exactly that. My response would be \"Thank you very much!\".", "Dump the brat\u2026his brother asked and they said yes!  That\u2019s not dumping a child on OP.  He gladly said yes.  It\u2019s in the OP.  \n\nYou don\u2019t agree to watch someone\u2019s kid and the back out when it gets hard.  Hell, I\u2019d be furious if you did that to my dog.  The only question I have is how hard OP tried to contact his brother before deciding he was done taking care of his niece.  It\u2019s possible he called several times and was at his wit\u2019s end.  But I get the vibe that it was a low effort attempt at contact.  Happy to be proven wrong though.", "Yeah, OP doesn't mention **why** brother was unreachable.  I'm kind of on the fence with, was he *really* unreachable (and if so, does he have a valid reason), or, how hard did OP *really* try to reach him?  If he was in meetings, etc., did she leave voice mails or texts explaining the situation?  Something's missing here.", "\"The father is also one, people that have kids don\u2019t just get to make themselves unreachable\"\n\nHe's on a business trip. He can't be reachable 24/7. I'm sure he has meetings. He might be driving, etc. Even an emergency, he won't be able to respond right away, which is why he left his child in the care of people he thought he could trust.  Plus, was he unreachable all day or just he small window of time that the OP gave him and then gave up.", "This is the worst part of it. He just wanted to have no responsibility and walk around in his underwear drinking beer.", "Who are you to violate a court order? This woman is allowed only once a month visitation. She is not legally permitted to take the girl for four days without the father\u2019s consent. I\u2019m struggling to understand where you got the idea that \u201cshe is her mom\u2019s daughter too\u201d trumps a lawful order issued by a judge. You may even have broken the law.", "Tbh it sounds plausible considering if the brother were actually able to make contact, he would've found out about the rearrangement alot sooner. That is, he would have checked in at least once over the course of the five days.", "Exactly how much effort did you put into trying to contact him?", "*facepalm*\n\nA teenager who's emotionally neglected by her mother should definitely be the pinnacle of perfect behavior! And when she doesn't behave perfectly just send her over to the parent that neglects her. \n\nSo let me ask you, OP. Why is it such a big deal when a child disrespects you, to the point where you need to break promises and send her away, but it's not a big deal when the child's own goddamn mother acts coldly and neglectful towards her?\n\nYou knew EXACTLY what you were doing. This was 100% malicious. She acted up for you, so you decided to punish her by reminding her how much her mother doesn't love her.\n\nShame on you!\n\nShame on you!\n\n*Shame on you!* \n\nYou're worse than childhood bullies that scream that other kids' parents hate them. At least kids have an excuse of not having developed brains.", "Do you got your feelings hurt because a kid cursed at you? Have you never heard that word before?", "Ah yes a woman we know nothing about who didn't want custody *must* be a monster, bc that's how it works, you can only be a good woman if you are also motherly.", "And that shit sticks with you for a long, long time. I'm 32 and still having conversations about this very topic with my therapist.", "Custody and parental rights are two different things. She still has parental rights and would be the person to go to if the custodial person was unavailable. Just making sure that\u2019s clear.", "Thank you for pointing this out! Way too many people think that the court doesn't allow men to be fathers, and that they're desperate to do it, lmao.\n\nI personally think that both men and women who ask for less than 50/50 for a child they willingly made are irresponsible. People are pointing out the SIL's choice of custody to emphasize how thoughtless OP was to leave his niece with her for multiple days, without her father's consent, when she doesn't want to see her more than once a month.", "Regardless of the sex of the parent, I\u2019d be making the same judgement. She\u2019s a shit parent and she asked for the shitty visitation", "The fact that he tried to reach the father indicates the father never communicated that he could not be reached. The father never tried to call in to check on the daughter. The father shares some of the blame for his lack of communication. And it's not like the kid was dropped off with a stranger. The mother was willing to step up.", "I am with one of the biggest phone companies in my country, who also work with a company who makes claims you can get unbreakable wifi anywhere in the country (BT and EE) and I can't get a signal in my small house or outside on the street on a rather clear day. There is a small area by the bathroom window which might generate enough signal to text.\n\nIt also doesn't sound like they tried for four days. On day 3 they got fed up and also shipped off the daughter to the ex. With no indication on how long they actually tried, its hard to fault the guy 100%. Doesn't sound like they spend days trying to contact him. Did OP try calling a couple times in 5 min? Did they text or message him in any way? We don't know how or for how long they tried but it doesn't sound like they did 4 days worth of effort", "Cool. I was at my sister's wedding in Brandenburg at my BIL family's farm estate and had really spotty reception and no wifi. What's your point?", "That makes your behavior here 100x worse", "Did you sit her down and try to find out what's up?  If not, then YTA.", "I understand that. What I meant is that OP seems to disagree with the idea that the mother doesn't want anything to do with her own child even if 1. they agreed with visitation; 2. The judge approved this because dad and mom decided this.\n\nOnly calls mother \"cold\".", "Mother or father, if you actively abandon your kids, I\u2019m going to judge you. I watched a mother of a classmate of one of my boys literally walk out on her 4 kids. If you\u2019re not happy in your marriage, fine. But when you shack up your internet boyfriend 2 miles and pretend you don\u2019t have kids? Yeah, YTA.", "Or it could be that the brother was somewhere that they would not have access to a phone.", "We don\u2019t know what the father does. There are a few possible reasons why the father may have been out of reach and unable to call himself. \n\nWhen I was military, we would have times where we did field training. We had no cell phones and no land lines. The commander had a satellite phone that was for emergencies only. So for a week or two, while we were in this training, we were completely incommunicado with the outside world. \n\nAlso, there are people who travel out of the country for work, and my not have international cell phones or able to use local land lines to call because of the costs. \n\nThe father trusted his family to be able to handle the child. They decided they didn\u2019t want to deal with the temper tantrum and pawned the kid off someone the courts even deemed unable to take care of the child. \n\nOP is definitely the AH", "Unless you are speaking to an AH", "If someone were keeping your kids, would you not respond if you saw a text or missed call?", "His first comment referenced OP. The 2nd comment should have been a reply back to pickleslut24, not himself.", "Then he should have told the brother upfront that there would be no contact.", "Totally depends on the job. I have a friend who does work on pipelines.  He cannot be reach unless by satellite and that is only for emergencies.  He can't check in with his kid.", "bet this is the way the kid acts at home and just eventually the mask came off. \n\none reason I will never watch anyones kids... ever", "Yes... If I knew. We have no information on what the OP did to contact them other then it failed. If my mum, friend or whoever tried to ring my mobile while I am at home, it would fail and I wouldn't receive a notification about it, so how would I know?\n\nOP never mentions texting, email, phoning, smoke signalling, Telegraphs or snail mail. Just failed communication.\n\nNow, since he only found out about his daughters location when he got home, we could go with the idea that he never once checked his email or text messages, or the more logical one of he never got one. Being modern day, Telegraphs and smoke signals are likely out and with him travelling, Snail mail is likely out. Leaving a phone call, which has multiple ways that could fail. He could ignore the phone, he could miss the 1 phone call and think that since it was only the one, it wasn't important or he could have been out of signal. We don't know", "I find it strange that he didn't find out until he got home and the daughter was really upset. So it seems like she wasn't able to contact him either? I need to know more about this work.", "still not sure how the second reply had anything to do with me, really. yeah i said i had worked in foster care, but that was just to explain that i thought i knew family court pretty well. other than that, the reply makes no sense. either way, it doesn\u2019t matter. i\u2019m not here to argue my point. just giving my thoughts", "Women are taught that word for word that when you push a kid out you'll fall in love with it. If you want these situations to not happen, we have to be honest about birthing and raising kids and that not everyone has it in them to be a parent", "It is quite possible she was nagged into the pregnancy.  \n\nOr it was an accidental pregnancy", "And put contingency plans in place.", "The brother might have been somewhere extremely remote without a phone.  Think like a military person in the field or something similar.", "He could have been unreachable for a plethora of things tbh. Ive been unreachable before because my phone straight up wouldnt show me that I was getting calls. If I have no service and I get a call, it won't even tell me my phone rang when I'm back in service, etc", "Oh yeah sorry I didn't mean you were personally yelling at them.\nAnd yes judge away! I also judge people who willingly and knowingly have children with people who don't want to be parents too. Which is sadly more common than I realised until quite recently."]}
