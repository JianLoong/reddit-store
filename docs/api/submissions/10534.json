You failed as an aunt and uncle, put a neon sign in front of your niece's face showing how little you care about or respect her, and irreparably damaged your relationship with your brother.

You're awfully fragile.\n\nAt the most, you should have waited for your brother to return, told her what happened, and said she would not be welcome to stay with you again until she apologizes and promises to follow your house rules.\n\nDumping her on her mom without your brother's permission was way, way, way out of line.

They trusted you to take care of their daughter and you completely ignored that. Holy crap.", "Yes, you are a huge asshole for this.\n\nIf you agree to look after a child, you are agreeing to everything a child entails - if that's a 13-year-old, that means extremely defiant behavior, including rudeness and refusing to follow rules.\n\nYou cannot simply abandon that child because they \"don't follow rules\". You've already agreed that they're not going to follow rules by agreeing to take on a 13-year-old.\n\nThe sheer level of arrogance, mental fragility, and a lack of appreciation of social contact you showed when you pawned her off for being a 13-year-old is staggering. Absolutely staggering. The mentality \"if it's unpleasant to me I won't endure it, even if I agreed to it\" is about as loathsome a trait as a person can possess, which only makes it worse for being an acquired rather than an innate trait.", "Sorry, YTA. I get teenagers can be difficult, but you can't break a promise to your brother to take care of his child. Especially after only three days. \n\nYou gave a 13-year-old away like it was a toy you were bored of, meanwhile breaking a parenting contract. That it's simply not acceptable. \n\nI understand you thought at that time you were doing the right thing for everybody and didn't mean to hurt anyone. You did still really hurt people, so a \"sorry I messed up and completely misjudged the situation and end up breaking your trust\" would be in place.", "YTA.\n\nYour brother has primary custody.

But I call bullshit. \n\nI would legit have a hard time ever speaking to you again. I wouldn\u2019t even pawn off a dog I was sitting for\u2026let alone a kid.

Now she's learned she can't trust or depend on you and your wife because at the first sign of trouble, you bailed. And you sent her to her mom's who, at best, is cold and unloving toward her. You think that doesn't mess with her head, to be reminded that her own mother doesn't want her around except to visit? No wonder she was in tears. \n\nYeah, you're the AH here. Hugely.

You are absolutely the asshole. You abandoned a child you agreeded to care for with out informing the adult you made the agreement with?

How could you expect that to go well?", "YTA.\n\nYou are adults...you agreed to help out and then didn't shoulder the responsibility.

You can't just pawn her off onto someone else when things get difficult. And at thirteen years old, I guarantee that she's more than old enough to understand that her mother wants very little to do with her, but you forced her to go there anyway.

He obviously chose you as he didn't want to choose her.", "YTA - you agreed to watch a teenager and give up after just a few days because they're acting like a teenager? Seriously?

I hope you never have kids of your own because this is such irresponsible behavior.", "listen dude, I hope you will reconsider this attitude once you have kids. Teenagers are supposed to behave stupidly and test boundaries, adults are supposed to EDUCATE THEM. Ok?

The kid was acting out, deal with it like adults.", "YTA you made an agreement to watch your niece! What would you have done if you couldn't reach the mother? Found some other relative to dump her on? You're (supposedly) an adult, but you acted as petulantly as the teenager you were responsible for, made her feel unwanted/unloved, and you violated a legal parenting contract on top of it.

I don\u2019t know what was going on that caused her to act out the way she did and I think that that needs to be addressed so she can be helped because it sounds like something is going on for her to have a complete behavior switch. And no matter what, OP shouldn\u2019t have sent her away. I just disagree with the generalization that \u201coh she\u2019s a teen they can be rude and defiant\u201d", "To be fair, OP didn't specify how many times they tried to contact the brother or how long.", "Except OP doesn't specify anything about how many times they tried to reach him. Like was it \"I called and texted multiple times over several days but he didn't get back to me\" or \"I called him once and he didn't pick up immediately and I didn't bother trying again\". Reading OP's replies and them avoiding that question I'm leaning towards the latter.\n\n\nFurther depending on where brother goes being incommunicado wholly or in part might be unavoidable, there aren't mobile reception everywhere, which shocks city dwellers but there you are. That said, since brother being unavailable would then be expected steps should have been taken  before he left in addressing how to deal with unexpected situations where getting in touch with him would be needed.", "There are absolutely jobs out there that make you unreachable during the day.\n\nAnd it sounds like during that one day was the only time OP even tried, as the daughter was supposed to stay for 7 days, of ugh they were 3 days in, and was asking the daughter's mother to watch the kid for 4 days.", "If a dad had one day a month visitation, I absolutely would say the exact same thing. \n\nWhere is she 100% full time mom? Are\u2026are you ok? \n\nShe may be the mother but she ain\u2019t her mommy.", "Agreed. There's a reason the mom wasn't looking after the niece in the first place.", "It\u2019s her mom who only has visitation (which means no overnights), and who treats her coldly. Being forced to stay with her for several days could have absolutely been bad for that child\u2019s well-being. Just because someone is a mom doesn\u2019t mean they are good for the child.", "Then I cant say as to whether or not you may have just lost your brother a whole lot of support for his kid, but it's still possible. \n Still YTA. A teen was being a teen. And you were good just leaving the kid with someone who has made it abundantly clear they didn't want her. Had mom wanted her she wouldn't have asked for visitation only. This is likely gonna hurt your relationship to the kid, who you claim you love. And you clearly did not think through any repercussions past \"I said I'd watch her, but she acting out so I'm just gonna nope out\" Teens test boundaries, it's part of the teenage independence process. She thought she was somewhere safe to test her boundaries. She got taught once she's a little difficult, you're gonna get rid of her. Not only is that gonna make her not trust you, it's gonna make her question trusting her dad, who entrusted you with her care to begin with.", "It's still not op and his wife's job to parent her!\n\nBrother needs to get a job where he's at home.  Sounds to me brother is pissed because now ex wife knows he's rarely fucking there for his daughter, and is little better than her mother, always palming her off.", "I'm inclined to not doubt the story because of that specifically, my abusive parent got significantly more than one day a month of time because they pushed for it. \n\nIf the SIL just didn't ask for any custody, then that's what it is.\n\n(this is a wild guess)", "Cool. This is my opinion.", "I mean fathers ask for lower than 50/50 at statistically higher levels than women but the public perception is that they are victims of the courts.\n\nhttps://legaljobs.io/blog/child-custody-statistics/\n\nLike in the site I linked around 90% of cases get settled out of court and in at least half of those cases they agree on the mother having the majority custody. But take a look around reddit and one would think that every custody case is targeting fathers. Why when a woman asks for less she is villainized?", "They aren\u2019t going to order more visits than what a party wants.", "OP didn\u2019t call his brother. His brother didn\u2019t find out until they arrived from their trip. He claims he was unable to reach his brother.", " Like, unless she was putting you and members of your household in physical danger, there is no excuse.", "I know the inside details of a family member in this situation.  If I called the ex to finish out time I promised, I\u2019d be dead to that family member.  It\u2019s important in light of the courts to just get the kid out of the bad situation.  So you make arrangements and get the custody.   If she willingly gave up custody it\u2019s not a situation you put the kid in. \nThe brother might not share the details because that can be seen as alienation of the other parent.  I personally want to order billboards, to out the family\u2019s ex I know.\nSome moms just don\u2019t want to be a mom. And when they\u2019ve hit their limit, they make bad decisions. Very bad decisions.  \nThe brother being unable to contact is bad.  \nBut damn, you ride out the week.  And you don\u2019t make that promise again", "Why does it smell fishy? If the parents agree to this isn\u2019t not weird for the judge to sign off. That\u2019s what we did for my divorce. My ex has visitation only because that\u2019s what worked best for us. Doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s anything weird behind the scenes.", "Who gave up almost all custody rights. She might have given birth to her daughter, but she doesn't want to be a mother. Giving birth to a child doesn't make you a fit parent.", "Seriously. Why was dad gone? Why did she THINK dad was gone? Had she asked to spend the time with mom? If so, why was that not an option? Why did her behavior \"suddenly\" turn? Did something in their house/care happen? There were so many better questions to ask before jumping to offloading her, especially recognizing that kids often act the worst around the people they trust the most, like a pressure release valve.", "Her aunt threw her out because of her behaviour, not causing it.", "She forced her aunt to throw her out. She alreadly had a lot going on with her before she get to her aunt.", "I was a teenager once. I was even 13 at some point, like the niece in this story. I would never ever have behaved badly at someone else\u2019s home. And if I did then my actions would have, and should have had consequences. A 13 year old guest does not have the right to \u00abtest boundaries\u00bb with her hosts.", "She knows the rules my brother goes out of town a lot she always stays with us. We never had any problem like this before", "This. OP seems to think that all you have to do for a child is feed them, give them a place to sleep because that's what ex SIL does. The bare minimum. There is a reason ops brother didn't send his daughter to spend the week with her mom.", "Yeah he just showed this poor child he loves her the same as her mom ie not at all. Love is actions. This wasn\u2019t loving.", "> I dread to think what flimsy, weak behaviours pass for \"discipline\" in your family.\n\nSays someone who has just written five paragraphs attacking firm, consequence-based discipline?\n\nIt's quite easy. If you go to stay with someone and behave badly, they may choose to send you somewhere else. Don't want to be sent somewhere else? Don't behave badly.", "She wasn't \"abandoned\". The OP knew perfectly well how to deal with a teenager, and did so.", "When my kids sleep away from home I call them each night to say good night.\nHow did this dad only find out what happened when he returned", "Are dads with visitation no longer dads? Or is that just for women?\n\nYou have no idea what their relationship is like. It's very likely that the custody agreement even stipulates that each parents have a right to take the kid before any babysitter. Dad is also probably obligated to report any issues regarding the kid with the mom so it's only normal for her to be informed that her daughter is out there telling her aunt to fuck off. If she's \"colder\" than the dad, she might be the perfect parent to address this problem.\n\nHer rights have not been restricted or terminated. She just decided to give full physical custody to the dad and get visitation. The only reason everyone here is angry is because she's a woman and women aren't expected to behave like men.", "Even if she was dogsitting, this would be bad. OP's brother chose poorly.", "I don't think we strangers can better judge the family dynamic based on the single fact that the mother has visitation than op who is related to all of these people.", "How does OP\u2019s country have any influence on the \u201csupport system\u201d for his brother?", "Exactly. And my father got ZERO custody because he didn\u2019t want it, although if forced he would have taken me in a pinch lol", "I sincerely hope you don't have kids, then. And if you do, I certainly hope they never have a crisis around you.", "Saying that they couldn't reach their brother makes it sound like they called him and he didn't answer, no?", "The totality of the circumstances here. The teen wasn\u2019t left with the mother originally, the father of the teen flipping out like he did, and the teen crying about being sent there. Imho Something doesn\u2019t seem to add up. I feel there is a lot more to the story behind the scenes\u2026 \n\nBut you are certainly correct, I could be wrong. That\u2019s why I said imho and worded things in the manner in which I did.", "Guests don't have chores at other people's houses. This kid has chores in OPs house when she's there. It was apparently her first time acting out, and she stays there often due to Dad's travel for work. So she's not a guest at that point. She's a part of the family. Who at the first sign of being a teen got kicked out.", "Your experience isn't the only one that's valid.", "No, I don't think I would have either. Consequences, sure. Shipping her off to the non custodial parent without discussing it with the custodial parent?  Not ok. She was there for only a week.  Not 6 months.", "Sure, consequences, not being kicked out. This also isn't \"someone else's\" home, or \"hosts\", this is family.", "Also, I was a teenager too at one point. I know I was a picker eater(still am) and I used to throw tantrums everyday if my favourite dish wasn't served for dinner. I once threw a similar tantrum at my uncle's place and my aunt told my mom about it. My mom was out of town and when she returned, she took care of the situation and me. \n\nA 13 year old guest doesn't have the right to \"test boundaries\" with her hosts, the same way the \"host\" doesnt have the \"right\" to throw their underage guest out of the house without the parent's permission, especially if they promised to take care of the \"guest\". You don't even know if the SIL is someone you can trust around a child. It anyhow rare for a mother to not want custody for their child, who knows how she treated the child. And the last line of \"my niece crying didn't help either\" why was the niece crying if she was with her mother? There has to be more to the story than what OP told us.", "Okay, so this makes you look a whole lot worse, to be frank. The behaviour and outbursts were out of character and instead of sitting her down and trying to find out what was going on, what the problem might have been, working with her to solve that problem, you sent her the loud-and-clear message that you only like her when she's behaving like a little angel for you, and broke any trust she may have had for the pair of you. \n\nYou're supposed to be the adults in the situation.\n\nAnd you didn't answer my question. What chores?", "She's normally a good kid, *so something is wrong,* obviously!  Perhaps she's having problems at school, or with her friends, or a bf/gf! Maybe she's being bullied. Maybe she's experiencing teenager hormones (notoriously HORRIBLE at 13!). \n\nYou know she's normally a good kid, can see she's going through something, and instead of providing comfort and support... you ship her off to her mother's, her mother that doesn't love her. \n\nWhen she needed you the most, you cruelly turned her away. Your love is not real love. Your love is clearly conditional on her being an obedient robot. And you showed her clear as day that you do not love or care for her in the slightest.\n\nYou have ruined your relationship with her, but the fact is you never really had one. It was always conditional. This is not how you treat someone you love. This is how you treat an annoying pest. \n\nThis poor child. I hope her dad never allows you near her again.", "And you didn\u2019t think something might be bothering her? She could be getting bullied, or having problems with a class/teacher in school, or struggling with managing being a teen with hormones. You were cruel to her and from your comments you don\u2019t seem to be getting that. I\u2019ll never understand why people post here and then argue with everyone. It\u2019s disingenuous.", "Did you try to correct her behaviour at all? Consequences? Sounds like you went straight for abandonment. Poor kid, abandoned by her mum and now again by her aunt. That's going to REALLY help her behaviour.", "If that's what OP thought, he would've provided that himself, like he signed up to do.", "Because, as OP said, he made himself unreachable for the whole week. Meanwhile, mom picked up the phone and stepped up like a normal parent.", "Dad with once a month visitation are not \u2018100% full time dads\u2019. \n\nI have the same information that you do. You\u2019re inferring a lot from their \u2018custody agreement\u2019\u2026when OP literally said that the mom didn\u2019t want any more than what she has. So all of your speculation is complete bullshit. The mom didn\u2019t even want more visitation than once a month. That is not a mom. That would also not be a dad. \n\nBeing a parent is a lot more than biology and 1x a month visits.", "I believe the poster may be speaking of child support, but I would like them to clarify", "Interesting because I\u2019m a behavioralist, top rated by children and their parents and schools. This kid is manipulative because she didn\u2019t want her dad mad at her for causing a problem so she cried to get the uncle in trouble. I call it what it is. Bye.", "Her mother didn\u2019t want her which is why she wasn\u2019t left there initially.\n\nFlip the genders of the parents. Would it seem fishy to you that a dad only has once a month visitation?", "She was only there 48 hours or less before OP shipped her off. She was fine for the first day, but was out the door by day 3.\n\nThis OP shouldn\u2019t be allowed to care for a goldfish, let alone a child.", "Yeah she might have something going on and needed someone to talk to. They'd never know though because first sign of trouble she gets shipped out. It looks like op didn't even try to talk to his niece.\n\nGetting a guest to do chores is a bit weird IMHO too.", "The niece is 13. She's probably got puberty hormones and teenage stuff going on. It's should not come as a surprise that kids change in this age and become a bit more difficult. Or maybe she was going through something. Regardless, OP just shipped her off. And I agree, the fact that OP has a close relationship with this girl and has looked after her multiple times before makes it worse.", "Right instead of having a conversation with the niece she loves she sent her away and can't see she's the ass", "Yeah but op gave up on those things after a few days. I think he does think that because as soon as it got real and there was some obvious needs, op dipped out and sent his niece to someone else to deal with.", "Whoa whoa whoa, \"made himself unreachable\" dude, there's a dead zone in part of my house, my parent's place has no cell service and spotty internet. He was on a work assignment, and I've been on plenty of those where there's no communication", "You seem utterly ignorant of how custody agreements work. Voluntarily asking for visitation instead of full custody doesn't take away any parental rights and doesn't give any 3rd party some legal right to withhold the child from the parent.", "Since you want to throw out credentials, I'm a child development professional and cognitive behavioral therapist and you don't have NEARLY enough information here to determine that the behavior is manipulative and it's very concerning that you jump to that conclusion without all the information, and that new information was disregarded immediately when it didn't fit your narrative.", ">because I\u2019m a behavioralist,\n\nSay no more.\n\n\\*Shudders\\*", "Citation needed", "If the mother didn\u2019t want the kid, why only once a month. What\u2019s the point. The mother is \u201ccold\u201d. \n\nAnd yes. My opinion is not based in the gender or sex of the participants. Like I said, I could be wrong. It\u2019s just my opinion.", "I've been a teacher of kids that are the same age as OP's niece for the last decade; believe you me, I understand very well the realities of being 13. That said, in my experience, you don't *often* see severely out-of-character behaviour at the flip of the 13-year-old switch. You do see kids learning that they are independent people and testing boundaries (which could absolutely be what's going on here), but I think it's more likely that OP's niece has never particularly enjoyed the time she spends with OP and his wife, and is getting old enough - and bold enough - to express that. Either way, OP neglected to even try to figure out if there was a reason for the way niece was acting.\n\nWhole thing's a mess. OP and wife should be super ashamed of themselves.", "\u201cHm I wonder why this 13 year old whose mother is emotionally abusive, is poorly adjusted?

It looks bad to have no contact. She can stand once a month.", "Apparently the kid told OP \u201ceff you\u201d\n\nHeck my preteen has done that.

And somehow I\u2019m ignorant of the way \u2018custody works\u2019 which is fucking laughable.
