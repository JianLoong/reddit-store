As an adult, you do not want to be in a situation behind closed doors and in sleeping clothes with a teen minor where innocent behaviors can cause false interpretations or fabrications or teen judgment/hormones result in impulsive acts that are inappropriate.

Explain to him why sleeping in the same bed is not appropriate for either of you but that you are excited to do some teen stuff together. Tell mom and aunt to fork over some money (if appropriate for their financial means). Then go to the mall and show him cheap fashion choices.
