Even though you are related, you are an adult, and he is a teen minor. As an adult, you do not want to be in a situation behind closed doors and in sleeping clothes with a teen minor where innocent behaviors can cause false interpretations or fabrications or teen judgment/hormones result in impulsive acts that are inappropriate.  This is especially true when, from the post, it appears you two seem to have only recently been acquainted and largely are strangers.\n\nHis mom and aunt treat him like a 10 year old, he looks like a 10 year old, his needs are second to the obvious needs of a disabled sibling, and apparently has social regressive behaviors for his age. \n\nWhat the kid needs more than a sleepover is some peer guidance from you. Explain to him why sleeping in the same bed is not appropriate for either of you but that you are excited to do some teen stuff together. Tell mom and aunt to fork over some money (if appropriate for their financial means). Then go to the mall and show him cheap fashion choices.

The reality is, neglectful parents rarely change. \n\nAnd, sure, I'm putting a lot of assumptions based on one post. If this doesn't seem right, just forget it.
