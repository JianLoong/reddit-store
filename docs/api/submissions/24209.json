You have the right to refuse to share your bed with anyone - your mother, a toddler, an aunt, an elderly grandmother - and **especially** a teenager of the opposite sex.\n2. *He\u2019s had a hard life in ways, with my other cousin - his sister - being special needs, so he never really gets any attention at home*. Irrelevant. He is getting lots of attention from you on this trip. He doesn't need to sleep in your bed with you as well.\n3. *What made me think the request was a little weird was that the conversation involved his friends calling me \u201chot\u201d... when i\u2019m being told that his friends are \u201cjealous he gets to see me and be around me\u201d and then also asked if he can sleep in my bed with me\u2026 idk. Little creepy right?* A lot creepy, definitely. He and his friends are viewing you in sexual terms, and your aunt is going right along with it. Once in your bed, he will start making his moves on you. Tell your aunt in no uncertain terms to knock it off, and if either she or her son makes any kind of creepy remark or suggestion again or does anything to make you feel uncomfortable in any way, you will be absenting yourself from the house during the day for the rest of their stay, and he won't get to see you at all.\n4. *He looked genuinely sad when i turned it down.* So what?

His request was creepy, and his feelings are not your problem.", "Nta", "I literally would kind of be like he's too young for all that to have that mentality but then I saw 14 I was like yeah never mind you got to understand he's technically in high school now \ud83d\udc80 I've seen too many stories where someone who isn't that close to their cousin tries something. Believe me best to keep a healthy boundary", "NTA for not wanting to share a bed.... is your family really okay with this suggestion? They really shouldn't be willing to even consider this - even if the cousin were younger, it's still a weird request. Your cousin being 14 makes the request down right creepy.", "NTA", "I believe his intentions are pure, but you don\u2019t have to let anyone into your bed if you don\u2019t want to. NTA", "You live in Alabama?", "YTA if it was a stranger then NTA however it\u2019s your cousin who as you said you bonded with and doesn\u2019t have many friends and I think is clearly going through a rough patch and is probably a glass child, one night is hardly taxing for you but may have greatly helped him. Just because his friends think you\u2019re \u201chot\u201d has no relevance he is literally your family and as you said you \u201cbonded\u201d so I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be able to tell if he had bad intentions.", "NTA\n\nDefinitely.", "NTA.

NO.", "Nta \nInappropriate and his intentions are not pure.

You choose who to share your bed with, you don't share if you're not comfortable", "NTA. I have a 14 year old nephew. He\u2019s also very tiny and immature and could pass for 9, same as your cousin. I would not feel comfortable sharing a bed with him.", "NTA and neither is your cousin. Your aunt is the creepy asshole here.\n\nWhy is the aunt bringing up the fact that his \u2018friends\u2019 find her hot? Why is the aunt the one that\u2019s asking if her son can share a room with you? Is she trying to set him up with you?\n\nWithout this context, I am leaning more towards the aunt being the main asshole culprit. I may be wrong but this to me, reads as a kid with a shitty aunt whose only attention is to treat him like a baby and apparently her saying his friends find you sexy and pushing him at you?\n\nI hate that everyone\u2019s instant thought is that your cousin is a nasty creepo ready for incest. If his aunt infantilizes him and he has a hard life, no wonder he looked upset when she asked you if he can sleep in your room after saying all those nasty things.\n\nI\u2019d cry if the one cousin I looked up to and felt a connection with now thought I was a sleezeball only through the actions/words of my mom.

Him being sad doesn't obligate you to sleep in the same bed with him. The whole thing is creepy, especially your aunt.", "that\u2019s what i was thinking, i know when i was 14 my sexuality was something that crossed my mind, and asking to stay with my family member of such similar age would\u2019ve definitely made me feel weird. but maybe he doesn\u2019t think that way? and it\u2019s just a sweet interaction that i\u2019m taking too far? confusing stuff but thanks for agreeing with me haha", "this has helped a LOT. thanks for putting it into perspective more for me, as i said in another comment i\u2019ll be seeing tomorrow if anything else strange occurs, and if it does i\u2019ll do something about it for sure.", "Exactly. I don't think there's anything inherently gross or weird about sharing your bed..y'all realize you can sleep w someone w/o sexually desiring them, right??

While I agree that OP is NTA, I don\u2019t think that this situation is as extreme as you\u2019re making it out to be. OP should definitely not ostracize her cousin just because he asked to sleep in the same bed once, especially after they\u2019ve bonded recently. For all we know, the cousin could see OP as their only *real* friend and shouldn\u2019t be punished this badly because the simply made a request (even though it was a weird one). At the end of the day they are family and their relationship shouldn\u2019t be destroyed over this. Also, just because some teen boys do degenerate shit to their female relatives doesn\u2019t mean that all teen boys do.", "I don't necessarily think this is true. I think maybe he's a lil misguided and needs to be put straight. Teenage boys will try to get away with anything when it comes to teen girls.", "thanks i felt rlly judged for saying no, tried to blow it off as a joke and laugh afterwards, but the way it sat just didn\u2019t feel right. you\u2019re right i\u2019ll be a lot more careful, thank you!!", "He\u2019ll either touch her or try and take pics for his friends when she\u2019s asleep.

He might not have had any bad intentions whatsoever, but if you\u2019re uncomfortable then you\u2019re uncomfortable, and that\u2019s that. He can be sad, and that doesn\u2019t make him an AH, but you can hold your boundaries and that doesn\u2019t make you an AH either", "Don\u2019t let yourself be forced to leave your own home though.

Don\u2019t listen to this guy and end up regretting it after. Don\u2019t let him sleep with you, and don\u2019t stay alone with him if he shows more red flags. Because a 14 year old wanting to sleep in bed with his 19 year old cousin is a huge red flag.

She should report her family to CPS for sexual abuse!", "She doesn\u2019t need to ostracize him, just not be with him alone at night. Unfortunately I\u2019ve seen dozens of posts this week alone of the exact thing I said. It isn\u2019t reaching. It\u2019s more common than you think.

There was also a recent one of a girl finding her bras hidden in her brothers drawer, full of his dna. Family/teens doesn\u2019t automatically mean that it\u2019s probably nothing", "Please don't feel judged. Trust your instincts, if it doesn't feel right, then it most likely isn't.", "Thank you for listening to our advice. Listen to your instincts, always.

Always.", "yes ok, i was worried about overthinking but this really hits where it needs to", "So let me get me straight, the thoughts and words of *other people* determine the intentions of the cousin? Unless the cousin has said stuff like this too, there\u2019s no need to make such assumptions.", "Once again, just because some weirdos do it doesn\u2019t mean all teen boys do. What you\u2019re saying is kinda like when people get extra defensive around black people in public, just because *some* black people assault others.

Inn fact I posted that he shouldn't sleep in her bed. But that doesn't automatically make him \"bad\" for trying.", "It's gross and almost can guarantee his hands will wander.  \"I'm sorry, my hands wander when I sleep \"  will be his excuse to being a sick fuck.", "Nope. This situation determines it. No kid would be comfortable with his friends calling his cousin hot. Then asking to sleep in bed with her? He should be repulsed after such a conversation. Either you\u2019re one of those weirdos, or you\u2019re insanely naive. I\u2019m betting it\u2019s the first one. Why would you want to risk something horrible happening? Rather than just say no and hang out during the day? When she can control the situation if it goes wrong?", "The issue for me is that he lets his friends call his cousin hot. Then rather than being repulsed, he wants to sleep in bed with her. Why is this such an issue for so many? Why is she wrong for saying no? Why risk something bad happening? Rather than her just hanging out during the day, when she has control over what happens?"]}
