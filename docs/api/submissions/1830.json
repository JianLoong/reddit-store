This gave them more than 72 hours to prepare\n\nYesterday me and my son went in to pickup the food. after paying and receiving the 2nd order the worker called over the manager and they figured out what was going on.  The manager said we would have to pay an additional $160 tip before he would ring me up for the 2 remaining orders. We argued back and forth for a bit and I even offered to call my 2 friends whos real name I used to place the orders to bring their ID as this was 4 separate orders under 4 different people. He dismissed the offer and said the money was necessary to pay the workers who made the food and went on about how hard the restaurant industry is.\n\nAt this point a small line had started to form behind us with customers and the workers hearing the conversation. I replied with the idea that instead of a tip he should give the workers a cut of the profits of this giant order they worked so hard for. Everyone looked at him and I could tell he started to lose his cool a bit while reaffirming no tip = no food.\n\nAt this point we said just give the rest of the order to the employees to take home as a tip because we would be leaving with the 2/4 orders we paid for. The manager said it wont happen as they have a policy where uncollected phone orders must be thrown out?? The only way they would get paid is if we tipped.\n\nNonetheless we left and ordered pizza to make up for the rest.

This is literally the definition of having your cake and eating it.", "You\u2019re still an AH. Why do you even have to be told to tip for takeout? I automatically tip 18 to 25% depending on the difficulty of my order.\nIt\u2019s common sense when people are not paid a living wage", "That effort is what your paying for with the menu price.\n\nIf the menu price is not enough, that's the business owners problem, not the customers.", "bruh get a grip, it\u2019s a damn take out order i don\u2019t see pizza places like pizza hut or dominos or papa johns adding \u201cgratuity\u201d for a large order ?? holy ppl like you are infuriating you have such a problem feel free to tip on everyone\u2019s take out order behalf then", "it actually makes no difference to their workload.\n\nthey had made the 4 orders. same work as if it was 1 order.\n\nthe employees should be on a set hourly rate.\n\nand extra 160 in tip is rediculous.", "wrong. you're a cheater AND an asshole.", "You tried to pull a fast one and got caught, and are butthurt that you were held responsible for your actions. You\u2019re a weasel, and an asshole, who deserves to be banned from ordering at that restaurant.", "Do you tip when you dine in at restaurants because you definitely are an even bigger AH if you don\u2019t. If you can\u2019t afford to tip then do not go out for food. You are punishing the workers and the restaurant with your self righteousness", "Actually that\u2019s not how it works in North America. From what I understand it staff are paid lower than minimum wage on the expectation that tips make up the rest of their wage.", "That\u2019s super illegal", "The business owner\u2019s mistake in this case was calling it a tip. He should have said it was a service charge.", "This is what I\u2019m confused on, too. I tip 20% or more when I dine in, but don\u2019t understand tipping when I pick up. How is it any different from going to fast food and ordering takeout?", "Just cause it\u2019s the highest doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good. \n\nFor me, it\u2019s not so much about the fact that you had them cancel the two orders. It\u2019s more about the fact that you knew beforehand, tried to cheat the system, failed, and threw a fit. You weren\u2019t standing up for the workers, because you think they\u2019re doing just find money wise. They\u2019re not. All you did was get pissy when your scheming didn\u2019t work. YTA.", "Restaurant workers arnt subject to minimum wage laws. YTA.", "tips are not only expected for sit-down service. you already knew the policy at this restaurant anyway. and do you honestly truly believe that $15 is enough to live on ?", "This is insane. Who tf can live independently on $15? YTA", "Did you expect the food for free ?", "Tipping for takeout has always been a thing. You are making a server put the order together and package it all up. It\u2019s just as much work all at once as waiting on a table. Cheaping out would have been a 10% tip. Please learn from this and quit screwing waitstaff over. \nYTA", "Oh did I tell them as I had to explain all the last minute change of cuisine. We are all against tipping on takeout so they just laughed.\n\nI am shellshocked at how many people here think tipping on takeout is mandatory or normal.", "If their tips don't make minimum wage, then the employer has to make up the difference.", "The whole of Europe where minimum wage is mostly (in the richer countries) around 12\u20ac?!", "How does that make him TA? Thats makes the employers TA. Customers pay for food, companies make a profit on the food and should pay their staff from that profit.", "EMTs, Cashiers, Grocery store workers, Gas station attendants, and all types of retail workers live off $15 an hour. \n\nAlso its $15 minimum so there is nothing stopping the restaurant from paying more except greed.", "\"Mandatory\" isn't debatable here. If the restaurant says it's mandatory, it's mandatory.  It's part of the cost of ordering food from there.", "no, they don\u2019t.", "Business should pay their staff fair wages, rather than expecting customers to top them up with tips. But that's the tipping culture you have in your country and you knew the policy when you made the order so yeah, YTA, sorry."]}
