You must have had some clue something shady was happening because your brother's behaviour was sure weird. Why don't you just ask him if he sold your things? He might admit that he did but make excuses like they were damaged anyways and he didn't get much for them. He thought you didn't want them anymore because they'd been there for so long. Why do you want kid stuff, aren't you a grown man? I can hear him now. \n\nI don't think you can prove anything at this point so I'm not sure how getting the police involved will solve anything. Your mom should insist he let you into the basement but she has to live with him so that might not be safe for her.

Just say you need your stuff. You\u2019ve given them every opportunity to be reasonable about it. If they\u2019re not letting you get it, what else can you do but escalate?", "NTA. He clearly has done something with your stuff or he\u2019s doing some shady shit down there. Maybe I\u2019ve watched too many true crime videos but- the denied access to the basement is a red flag in general. Your mom should have access to HER basement. Weird af. Good luck", "NTA", "No key to get in, I walked down the first time when it was unlocked, but it's been locked every other time since then.", ">> either someone is trapped and dead down there OR he sold your stuff.\n\nHeh funny, my first thought is he\u2019s got a grow house going in mom\u2019s basement. I\u2019m thinking there\u2019s definitely something down there", "So your mother doesn't have a key to her own basement? \n\nSounds like a locksmith would solve your problem more easily than the cops.", "NTA \n\nGosh, you seem so naive. Your stuff is long gone. Even if you got into the basement at this point, the only thing you'd find is confirmation that you should have stood up for yourself sooner.", "Wtf? Just go into the basement? He doesn't need to allow you to do anything. You're grown. NTA", "NTA but dude. Your stuff is gone and you need to get a backbone. You\u2019ll give him three more months after 6 years of being treated like shit? What happened that made you like this?", "NTA. But your stuff is gone.", "But why do you need his permission to go to tge basement to get your own stuff? If it was me, I would just go there and rummage around. It is your mother's house not his.", "NTA\n\nThis is sketchy as fuck. Its quite possible he sold it, or is planning to, in which case you should not wait three months. The other strong possibility is theres something in the basement he does not want you to find. Or hes just an asshole for no reason, those people exist too.\n\nI would suggest you give him the chance to solve it without you going in the basement, like just asking him that if he does not want you down there, he should go down and just bring your stuff out to you, so you can put it elsewhere. Tell him that if he keeps refusing, you will get the police involved, and then actually do so.", "NTA. get the police involved now. you waited 4 years, don't give him another 3 months.", "NTA!  Your stuff is gone.  Do you have proof that you owned these things?  Because without it, I\u2019m afraid it might be your word against his as far as the police are concerned.  It your anger is justified and until your half brother is honest with what he has done with your things, I\u2019d go no contact with him and don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise.  He stole, he lied and is now gaslighting you.  He is an AH", "Of course you should escalate. You've been robbed. NTA", "NTA. Those items are yours. He is refusing to grant you access to retrieve your things. Take it to civil court and get a judgment to gain access to your belongings.", "NTA. He sold your stuff. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to prove anything to the police (if you can at all, did you take pics or inventory of any of your possessions?)\n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d ask for that key right now, go downstairs, confirm what you suspected (and hope some stuff can be salvaged), and ask bro for compensation. Immediately.", "NTA - If your family won\u2019t let you, where I\u2019m from the police will escort you to retrieve your stuff.", "Exactly what I was thinking. I was reading the whole thing like \"you know he sold all your shit right?\"", "I think people know these things and give up for an easy life, then later on get mad at themselves. That stuff has been gone for years and if it can\u2019t be tracked then I almost think ESH. It\u2019s pretty obvious it was stolen years ago. If you aren\u2019t willing to duke it out at the time what\u2019s the point in being upset years later because you realise it\u2019s now worth something? Don\u2019t mean to sound victim blaming but at some point you have to accept some responsibility for allowing things to happen.", "You should have gotten police involved years ago. Don't wait 3 months.", "The deadbeat has stolen and probably sold OP's stuff.  6 years is a long time to passively let a subject go. If OP really wanted the items he would have gotten a police escort to get access to it, not rely on the gaslighting brother to benevolently grant OP access to his own stuff. YTA for not resolving the matter.", "You\u2019re going to need to decide if you want to press charges, because he stole your stuff years ago.", "NTA, your stuff was sold years ago. IDK why you've let your half-brother keep you from your possessions for so long. At this point there's likely nothing you can do.", "NTA. But honestly dude the stuff is already sold. And you shouldn't wait, 3 months is bullshit. Call her up and tell her you're coming now and anything that's yours that is still in the basement needs to be put right into your hands when you come to the door, and anything that isn't needs to be immediately compensated for.", "ESH.  \n \nYour half brother sucks for absolutely obvious reasons.\n \nYour mom sucks for being a doormat and allowing this in HER house to start with.\n \nYou suck for being decidedly Nieve, and waiting YEARS to come close to doing something about it.\n  \n This should have been dealt with long long time ago, there's no doubt at all your stuff is gone and/or damaged. And with mom and brother backing half brother, the cops aren't going to be able to do anything. Especially if you have no proof. \n \n I'm sorry, really I am. This crap sucks.", "NTA, but you know he sold your stuff, right? I'm sorry he ripped you off, but there's probably nothing for you to retrieve here.", "Oh honey....\n\nNTA but I'm going to mirror the rest and say your stuff is likely long gone and what you're seeing on the internet may actually be some of your things being resold. I'm sure I speak for the rest of us that we hope this isn't the case but, I think it is highly likely your things are gone.", "NTA, but surely you realize that your half-brother sold your stuff a long time ago. You should have gone into the basement and checked on, or removed your stuff despite his protests.", "Seriously, do not wait. Whatever's still down there you need to get immediately, and whatever isn't you need financial compensation for immediately.", ">If you aren\u2019t willing to duke it out at the time what\u2019s the point in being upset years later because you realise it\u2019s now worth something?\n\nAnd how can even prove what he had down there?  Who's going to be able to verify specific video games or Magic cards he had that were valuable?  His brother is just going to say that stuff wasn't down there.  At this point, I don't think OP has any recourse, if he ever did.  The lesson is not to allow untrustworthy people access to your stuff."]}
