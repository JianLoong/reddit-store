Therefore you are entitled to your things. If anything it sounds like your brother did something to them. Why else would he be admittedly against you going to the basement to retrieve them?", "NTA - either someone is trapped and dead down there OR he sold your stuff. I would not wait three months. I\u2019d immediately call my mom and the cops to gather my items and be done with it. But it sounds like he sold your stuff.", "NTA. It\u2019s your stuff.

You must have had some clue something shady was happening because your brother's behaviour was sure weird. Why don't you just ask him if he sold your things? He might admit that he did but make excuses like they were damaged anyways and he didn't get much for them. He thought you didn't want them anymore because they'd been there for so long. Why do you want kid stuff, aren't you a grown man? I can hear him now. \n\nI don't think you can prove anything at this point so I'm not sure how getting the police involved will solve anything. Your mom should insist he let you into the basement but she has to live with him so that might not be safe for her. I guess you could get the police to force your brother into letting you into the basement but everything is probably gone or wrecked so you won't be any further ahead then you are now. You might have to write all that stuff off.", "Honestly yta since you bought his non answer about not going downstairs and then just leaving it for years.", "NTA - but you know your stuff is long gone, right?", "Why did you not take your stuff when you left? You moved into the basement to live with your stuff. You found a job and your own place to live and didn\u2019t take anything from the basement when you moved out? You just left everything there all your clothes and belongings?", "NTA \n\nHe sold your stuff", "NTA he already sold it. I hope you have records of your communication regarding this.", "Nta,but he's already sold it likely so you shouldn't wait- get the police involved ASAP.", "ESH, don\u2019t call the cops just find a time he\u2019s not there to go down and discover he sold it all a long time ago\n\nThen get into the real argument about him selling your shit", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
