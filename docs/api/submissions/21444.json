I still have a few friends back home and I go back for a long weekend each summer to visit with my buddies. We go to restaurants, go see old haunts, maybe take in a concert or a ballgame. It\u2019s always a good time. There are 5 of us left (used to be 6) and we have vowed to keep the tradition up until the last man is left standing.\n\n  \nOne of the guys \u201cHarry\u201d (62M) I\u2019ve known since preschool. He\u2019s\u2026 different. He doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends and doesn\u2019t do well with women. There are reasons for this. Many reasons. But, I won\u2019t get bogged down here trying to describe ALL of his various neuroses. For the sake of this post I\u2019ll keep it relevant. Trust me when I say that his problems are all self inflicted.\n\n  \nHarry is a really picky eater. He always has been. His mom always indulged him on this I guess because it was just easier. For example I witnessed many times where she\u2019d make him something to eat. If he didn\u2019t like it he\u2019d get up and throw it in the trash. After he would whine ridiculously she\u2019d make him something else. My mom would have send me to my room. Restaurants were really trying. His mom would drive servers crazy trying to please him enough to get him to eat which was embarrassing. As we grew, I avoided eating with him.\n\n  \nCut to a few years ago. I make restaurant reservations on our reunion weekend based on suggestions from people who were going to be in attendance. The majority suggested a particular place, so I make the reservation. It\u2019s a nice, upscale restaurant. Turns out Harry is banned from this place. Not sure exactly why, but I wasn\u2019t surprised. There were lots of people going and trying to change venues with that many people involved would be too difficult. One of the guys though knows the manager and convinced her to let Harry come if we took responsibility for him. We all had a great time. Everybody except Harry. When we weren\u2019t looking he send his entree back to the kitchen because he didn\u2019t like the way it was cooked. Long story short, he got kicked out and banned all over again.\n\n  \nCut to last week. This years get together is the weekend of 7/15. I forgot that Harry was banned from this particular place. There are a few stragglers coming and they love this place. Harry of course wants us to change restaurants. I decided that I\u2019ve had enough of it and I\u2019ve refused to change venues. He\u2019s been blowing my phone up leaving voicemails and texts. I\u2019ll be up there several days and he\u2019s invited to everything, including many other meals. So, he\u2019s not being treated poorly I\u2019m just sick of the bullshit. He\u2019d only miss that dinner.\n\n  \nHe\u2019s been calling everyone trying to get them to work on me because I \u201chate him\u201d. Could I have handled this better, or am I justified in holding him accountable for his behavior?\n\n  \ntl;dr: lifelong picky eater banned from a restaurant.

Nobody gets banned from a restaurant for being a picky eater, they get banned by acting like belligerent a-holes and harassing the staff.  Do you know how hard it is to get banned from a restaurant?

Getting banned from several restaurants is not picky behavior, it's pathological imo.\n\nHarry should supply a list of banned establishments, and it's his responsibility to keep you updated. Or he takes over reservations completely.", "NTA. Let's be real, you need to be considerably more than \"a picky eater\" to get banned from a restaurant.", "NTA. Why would anyone go to restaurant with this person? You would literally be deliberately setting yourself up for public humiliation.", "NTA - He's acting like a literal child. I wouldn't want to hang out with him at all. As you said, he does it to himself.", "NTA : The group chose this place, and he got himself banned.

And even if you found another restaurant that hasn't already banned him, it's just a matter of time. Harry doesn't give af, given when you guys got him in at the restaurant he was already banned at, he still sent food back.

Last time you guys had dinner there, you had to speak to the manager to have him come back in. \n\nSure, if may be a bit uninviting but he could have behaved that dinner knowing he was there under special circumstances. His action of sending back food while no one was looking was very selfish.

You could manage this better. Yes, the first time, Harry should've given a heads up that he was banned and that you should go somewhere else. He also sounds difficult to include.
