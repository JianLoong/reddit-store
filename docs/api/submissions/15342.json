{"id": 15342, "submission_id": "12u55gs", "title": "AITA for taking my necklace back when my boyfriend gave it to his sister?", "selftext": "I (23F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been dating for 3 years. We moved in together last year, and have no problem sharing our stuff. My boyfriend sometimes gives cheap rings I don\u2019t want to his sister. I have no problem with this because they\u2019re rings made out of plastic. He does sometimes give rings I want to his sister, but I\u2019ve learned to forgive him. \nHis sister (23F) which I\u2019ll call Emily has had a birthday recently. For this birthday, my boyfriend which I\u2019ll call Mark gave his sister a necklace that my brother gave to me. I\u2019m only able to see my brother once a year because he lives in a different country. \n\nAnything he gives me I always make sure I don\u2019t loose it. I\u2019ve been wearing a necklace he got me on one of my trips to visit him. I always wear that necklace, but I take it off when I shower and sleep. \nBefore going to sleep, I put the necklace in a little box with the rest of the jewellery my brother has gotten me. Two days before his sister birthday, I woke up to find that necklace gone. I asked Mark if he saw my necklace anywhere and he told me he hadn\u2019t. I burst into to tears knowing one of the few things I love is gone. I somewhat got over it on Emily\u2019s birthday. \n\nThe birthday party was at her house, and she invited everyone in their side of the family. After she blew out the candles, it was time for presents. Emily and I don\u2019t have a good relationship, the only reason we somewhat get along is because of Mark. She opened Mark\u2019s present first, and once she took out the necklace I saw that it was my necklace, because it had both mine and my brothers initials on it. I asked if I could see it up close and she handed it to me. I immediately saw that it was my necklace. I asked Mark why he gave her my necklace, and he told me it isn\u2019t mine. I showed him that it was both mine and my brothers initials on it. Emily tried to snatch it back from me, but I backed away. \nI ran out from her house quickly grabbing my bag and leaving.\nI\u2019ve ignored all the messages ive been getting from her family about how it\u2019s just a necklace. Me and Mark haven\u2019t spoken since then.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682088751, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12u55gs/aita_for_taking_my_necklace_back_when_my/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That so bizarre and somewhat creepy to me...\n\nYou're NTA but why have you been putting up with him stealing from you for so long?", "NTA \n\nHe stole it and lied about it. \n\nWhy are you with him? Break it off and find someone who doesn't steal from you and gaslight you about it.", "NTA \n\nYour bf is a thief. When I first read plastic rings I thought the little sister was a kid but damn a 23 year old? You mentioned you don't get along, she also wanted the necklace back even after knowing the truth. I am guessing she probably knows her brother steals stuff from you for her. The entire family is a menace. Frankly I want to label you as a ah too, you 'learning to forgive' instead of 'kicking him to the curb' probably strengthened your bf's resolve to steal from you.\n\nThis relationship is dead. Probably has been for a along time. There is no need to speak to him anymore.", "NTA, but you never should have let bf establish a habit of stealing from you.  He moved from the innocuous to the valuable.  He then lied about it when it was \"missing\".  He piled onto his crimes at the party when he lied about it not being yours.\n\nHe's shown you who he is: a lying thief.  Drop him.", "NTA. This guy is a lying, stealing, mooch. He's used you repeatedly to take shit from and gift to other people. I wouldn't be surprised if he had stolen other valuables from you and lied and this is just the first time you caught him. \n\nI think you already know you should stay away from this guy and his family. I just hope you follow through. He's taking advantage of you in this way, I can guarantee he's taking advantage of you in lots of other ways you just maybe haven't identified yet.", "NTA . Your boyfriend is a thief. He stole rings from you in the past and he stole your necklace too. He saw how distraught you were and how you searched for it and he still did it. Dump him and look around to make sure you are not missing anything else", "NTA and why isn't it a required step that he confirm what he's gifting before gifting it?\n\nINFO: Is there an income disparity between your families? Why does he think it's generally okay to be gifting from your jewelry box if she doesn't even like you?

You may have \"no problem sharing\" but this isn't sharing. He's stealing your jewelry, and maybe even worse, he can look you in the eye and LIE about stealing your jewelry, and then gaslight you by saying a necklace with your and your brother's initials on it isn't yours.

At a Party HE KNEW YOU WOULD BE ATTENDING???\n\nHow does this make sense???  \nHow could he have thought of doing this without realizing how stupid this is and how much this would hurt you???\n\nGive it a day or two to settle, then you will need to have a serious talk with both your BF and his family.", "NTA, time to take out the trash, you want to be with this family about as much as you want a raging case of the \ud83d\udc4f", "NTA\n\nSo he's your ex BF now, right?", "NTA. He's a thief and you can do better. Pack your things quick before he steals more stuff!", "NTA it was not his to give.  It\u2019s important to you and your brother; clearly not to him.

He's been giving your jewelry to your sister and you \"learned to forgive him\". No, you taught him it's okay to steal from you. THEN he lied to you about your necklace when you asked him about it and brought you to his sister's party where he KNEW you would see his \"gift\" and lie again to your face about it. Wow. Is he your ex yet?", "so he stole your necklace?\n\nSounds like you two need to use your words more. Have a \"bargain bin\" for stuff you don't mind giving away. BT HE LIED. He knew what he was doing. This sounds more like theft than a mistake. \n\nBe careful. See if anything else is missing.", "NTA, he stole from you, lied to your face, and then thought you'd be too dumb to recognize your own jewelry.  I would never talk to him again.", "NTA and I sincerely hope you have dumped that thieving AH permanently. You ignored a lot of red flags and he just kept getting more blatant. Cut him and his enabling family all off.", "NTA but girl break up with him!\n\nStealing from you isn\u2019t \u201csharing your stuff.\u201d It\u2019s stealing. This is not normal behavior", "Your boyfriend is a thief.\n\nEdit: surely your EX-boyfriend?", "NTA - and this guy is a straight up thief! Get out now, before it moves to serious stuff. It\u2019s clear your BF doesn\u2019t respect you or your boundaries. This is red flag central!", "He's been from stealing from you and you just learned to forgive him? GTFO with that dumb shit. NTA but you need to get rid of him and find some self respect", "NTA\n\nI think the start of the opening sentence is wrong.  It should be \"I (23F) and my EX boyfriend.\"", "YTA\nI say that because you continued to live with someone that disrespected you and stole from you repeatedly.  It should've been addressed the first time something was given away without your permission. Doesn't matter the value of a item.\n\nMove out or kick him him out.
