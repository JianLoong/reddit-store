That means at all times during the winter, she's wearing a minimum of two layers on her chest and has a hat on her head when she's outside.

The final straw was this past week i was off work, and he wasn't and daycare was closed so he asked if i could watch her. I said sure no problems. Just bring her to daycare mommy at normal daycare time to keep her schedule. When he dropped her off, i about blew a gasket because he had our two year old dressed in a sweater (nothing underneath it), and shorts. That's it. Took her inside immediately and put some clothes on her and asked him why in heavens name is she dressed like this. He said that she was only outside for five minutes so he saw no point in putting a full outfit on her. \n\nI reminded him that it's winter time and her body is still learning how to regulate temperature and she needs to be covered. She also needed at at least have a shirt underneath th sweater because what if she got hot and we took the sweater off. She'd be naked! He just shrugged and went about his way saying it's not that serious. I called his mother who I'm still on good terms with. I told her what happened and she was furious.
