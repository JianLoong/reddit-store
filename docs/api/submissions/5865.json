That means at all times during the winter, she's wearing a minimum of two layers on her chest and has a hat on her head when she's outside.

On my weeks, she is always wearing one and i always send her to his house fully clothed with one on. When i get her back the next week, he has her dressed in MAYBE pants Tshirt and a jacket. The final straw was this past week i was off work, and he wasn't and daycare was closed so he asked if i could watch her. I said sure no problems. Just bring her to daycare mommy at normal daycare time to keep her schedule. When he dropped her off, i about blew a gasket because he had our two year old dressed in a sweater (nothing underneath it), and shorts. That's it. Took her inside immediately and put some clothes on her and asked him why in heavens name is she dressed like this. He said that she was only outside for five minutes so he saw no point in putting a full outfit on her. \n\nI reminded him that it's winter time and her body is still learning how to regulate temperature and she needs to be covered. She also needed at at least have a shirt underneath th sweater because what if she got hot and we took the sweater off. She'd be naked! He just shrugged and went about his way saying it's not that serious. I called his mother who I'm still on good terms with. I told her what happened and she was furious. She called him and scolded him telling him to at least have two layers on the child just in case.

If she were to have prolonged stints outside in under 40\u00b0 with wind, there better be a coat around otherwise a jacket to get from point A to B is just fine. Short sleeves under a coat is fine. Running from car to store in just a shirt and pants is fine. \n\nToday we went sledding in 35-40\u00b0 and my daughter had boots, snowpants, coat, long sleeves, mitten, and hat. 15min in and everything came off except the shirt and snow pants. She was sweaty. I was sweaty. She doesn\u2019t have any undershirts. \n\nIf he has a jacket for her or a coat in the car or wherever so she can put it on when cold that\u2019s all I\u2019d ask for.", "NTA, but calling them won't change anything. You know that. You cannot change your ex, you are not in charge when your child is with him. Even though you'd like for him to do xyz, he is not obligated to. He is a parent also. He has the right to be a 'bad parent' as long as he isn't abusive, and even then we know courts are unlikely to do much.", "NTA\nAnd idk why SO many people are arguing about whether or not 5 minutes outside is enough to get her sick or if the cold makes you sick.\nThe issue is she went outside, unprepared for the weather. Yeah, she would \"only\" be uncomfortable in that time, but the issue is she wasn't prepared to be outside any longer.\nYou don't play games with your kid's health.", "Ex is an asshole and now his mommy knows. NTA", "NTA - you\u2019re totally right and this is really dangerous for her. Please keep all of this documented. If I were you, I\u2019d have your parenting plan amended to require safe clothing", "NTA\n\nAsk him what happens when she is underdressed and the car breaks down, so she's out there for more than 5 minutes.", "He agreed.", "NTA \n\nThe ex is free to dress how he likes but needs to dress a child properly if she has to venture out in cold weather, it\u2019s not an option", "NTA. It's been below freezing here in AL. Your ex is crazy. She could literally get frostbite.", "NTA. Some dudes sometimes need mommy to tell them they're being bad to correct their ways \ud83d\ude44 Being there, done that too.", "NTA. You did good calling her! Poor MIL she has to take care of an adult baby and a baby baby.", "Exactly why I don't go to Walmart in my pajamas!  If I end up on the side of the road...", "This dad is being so obtuse- the thinner the underlayer, the easier it is for the body to keep it warm- the insulating layers on top don\u2019t need to be warm to be effective- just a sweater on a kid is a giant heat sink, the thickness might even be a detriment as opposed to an undershirt and a thinner sweater", "Yeah it was in the 40s here and I was so happy because we had sub zero temperatures last week! I work in daycare and not all the kids were undershirts.", "Bummed I had to scroll so far to see a response like this. Having worked in daycares \u2014 yeah, they\u2019re breeding grounds of disease and disgust, even in the best scenarios. \n\nDo I think dad should have spare clothes in his car? Yes. But that\u2019s because I\u2019ve been around kids enough to know that vomit/poop/disaster messes happen. \n\nAs the kid who refused to wear a coat unless it was windy, who is now an adult who refuses to wear a coat unless it\u2019s windy\u2026. This just seems like a huge overreaction.", "Your comment was a headache to read lol", "Michigan checking in here too. Reading this thread makes me chuckle. The human body isn\u2019t as delicate as everyone is acting.", "Yes, I agree. As a former southerner (TN) now living in CO, and a parent \u2014 the idea of forcing a child into an undershirt every single day their dressed is nuts to me. Especially since my kiddo, like me, runs warm. Do we check to make sure she\u2019s safe and warm? Yes. Do we have spare clothes in the car in case of an emergency? Yes. And do I force her to wear a coat and hat every time we\u2019re outside? No.", "We\u2019re Northern UK. Still kids going to school in shorts at that temperature\u2026 still people out without coats. Again, like those in this thread are saying, yes extended periods, of course, but our children still jump into the car in their PJs if we need to quickly nip out somewhere and wouldn\u2019t think of wearing a coat if we were going door to door somewhere. I\u2019m not neglectful, but it\u2019s just as it is where we are\u2026 difficult in the summer months mind!", "It\u2019s not.", "Cold doesn\u2019t cause illness\u2026", "You\u2019ll see some guys walking around in 0\u00b0 F in shorts in more northern parks of the US. It\u2019s not dangerous to be in those temperatures for short periods of time walking from a car to a house\u2026", "You put an undershirt on at 16c? Your kid is overheating.", "I agree that hypothermia is unlikely - but I also know from experience that body temperature, fluctuations and ability to regulate are so different from one person to another. I was knocked unconscious, while wearing jeans, knee high boots, a turtleneck and a thick sweater. The temperature outside was in the mid 40\u2019s. It was dry. When I was found, my body temp was 93\u00b0.  My point is just that everyone is different and why take the risk? Again, I agree there is no reason to take the risk.", "Bacteria are more able to invade and reproduce if the body is chilled.", "It doesn't directly cause them to be sick but if your body is stressed from the cold, your immune system may not be operating at top speed therefore you can be more susceptible to the viruses floating around.", "I think, there is a little mixup. OP probably didn't talk about 30\u00b0 C but 30 Fahrenheit. And with Fahrenheit, there are no minus temperatures.", "We did leave the water dripping but it still froze, everybody was leaving their water dripping so much that the water company had to post on Facebook saying that they were getting low and to limit water usage.", "Ha, I'm so with you, but with flip flops or bare feet. I walked through snowy slush this morning in my flippies and my SO gets so annoyed (lightheartedly) bc I wont dress my feet appropriately so tend to step on something I shouldn't, etc. :)   \nAnd yes, spare clothes is always essential", "Thank you.  This thread is weirding me out.  A sweater and jacket to go from house to car to house is enough.  Why is everyone so paranoid?  A 2 year old is capable of complaining if they're too cold.", "Bodies operate the same no matter where they live.", "Kids who are too cold will say so. Kids who are too hot will not.", "He\u2019s not, though. An undershirt is just making a thicker base layer, which means that when she\u2019s inside, it\u2019s a problem. Proper layers mean a normal shirt with a removable sweater over it so that you can maintain a comfortable temperature while inside. All you\u2019re doing with an undershirt is overheating her, when what you should be doing is getting her a proper outdoor jacket. Undershirts are only appropriate for extended outdoor time, not for indoor/outdoor time.", "Actually it can as it can lower the body temperature/ defenses temporarily especially when going from an extreme cold setting to a warm setting . Not having proper clothing is a big reason I have so many patients here.", "Me. I am that person. It was 6 degrees the other morning and I was outside cleaning out my car in gym shorts and a hoodie\u2026 \n30 degree weather for an extended period of time could be an issue, but for a few minutes? No.", "Not really, here It\u2019s common - we have 35 degrees in summer and from November on when temps drop she will have an undershirt. We have lots of humidity and wind where we are by the sea. Of course she won\u2019t wear a puffer jkt with this weather.", "Properly dressed for what? Is she out in that kind of weather for hours standing stock still? She was going from house to car to house. Her mother has clothes for her. If she took off her sweater she\u2019d be in an undershirt and shorts in her own house. Like a lot of people do. If she was at a playground like that in 30\u00b0 weather that\u2019d be different. 50\u00b0 and I wouldn\u2019t bat an eye.", "The child was not playing outside, just going from door to car and car to door. And no, 30 is not going to lead to hypothermia. That\u2019s nowhere close to the temperatures that they don\u2019t allow kids to go outside to play in schools or daycares.", "My point is that it\u2019s not about the tiny chance of hypothermia or frostbite. It\u2019s that a small child would be uncomfortable because they\u2019re cold. And a small child might not be able to communicate when they\u2019re uncomfortable because at 2, some children don\u2019t even speak in full sentences. The child might just say \u201ccold\u201d and dad would be like \u201cyeah it is\u201d and the child could fuss and dad might assume that the child is cranky or hungry or doesn\u2019t want to sit in the car seat. \n\nA parent that wouldn\u2019t consider if their child is uncomfortable from cold is negligent. The same type of parent that would leave babies in diapers that have pee in them but aren\u2019t full.", "For the body to be chilled, the child would have to be exposed to mild cold for a prolonged period of time. 30s and 40s temp is mild. If it was extremely cold, like -40 degrees, hypothermia can happen in only 10 minutes. \n\nA 2 year olds body would stay at a healthy temperature longer than an elderly person, newborn, or person with circulatory issues. 5 minutes isn\u2019t enough time to lower the core body temperature AT ALL unless the child was completely naked or wet.", "Yes there are negative Fahrenheit temperatures\u2026.", "Colorado native, when the temperatures finally got above 0\u00b0f last week I went out to shovel, had to take my heavy jacket off 10 minutes in.\n\nMy sister recently moved to Tennessee, an inch of snow can shut her city down, they have maybe one plow truck? But, the humidity causes that cold to go straight to your bones. And 95\u00b0f plus 80% humidity is like living in soup. My husband and I always joke that at least it's a dry heat/cold here.", "True but it would take the body a while to get used to a type of weather", "And it shows.", "Info: how far did he have to drive, and is any of that distance in the middle of nowhere where he\u2019d actually be stranded?", "She spent an entire paragraph describing conversations she\u2019s had with him on the issue.", "At 16 degrees I should hope not", "Because he didn\u2019t send extra layers! He dropped her off in a sweater and shorts and nothing else!", "Not really. It takes the individual time to mentally cope, but the body reacts how it\u2019s going to react no matter what.", "Not shaming her. Saying that what dad dressed her in is not anything to have a fit about. It\u2019s not that inappropriate for the weather. And no, I would not be mad at someone putting sunscreen on my kid for the 5 minutes they would be outside even if it were 100", "So OP didn\u2019t have extra clothes either? Why is that all dad\u2019s fault?", "New Englanders and Nordic countries know how to dress for the weather. I\u2019m pretty sure this kid in Alabama is layered in cotton.", "Not part of this debate, but I know that a lot of the things that my peers and I were taught in school were incorrect. Science is always learning.", "They provided information on their claim: being in the cold causes increased bacterial activity.  You are the only person responsible for publicly verifying your own claim.", "Dad was dropping the kid off at daycare.", "I love this so much hahaha", "Cotton is better than polyester", "Do you really think that being cold for a few minutes leads to illness in the same way that sustained being cold for a few days would?\n\nLike seriously.", "\u201c 30\u00b0 weather with a wind-chill of 15\u00b0\u201d\n\nYes. Having the wind drop it 15\u00b0 or 40\u00b0 *makes a huge difference*. Yes it matters.\n\nI live in the cold weather. It was -30\u00b0 last week due to the wind. It\u2019s now 30\u00b0 due to the wind. It is *warm*. \n\nShe spent half the time talking about undershirts like it\u2019s a make or break deal. And her comments talking about it\u2019s \u201cfatal\u201d. Like I don\u2019t even get the layers comment, you take the sweater off and she\u2019s going to be wearing a flimsy undershirt? Like *that* wouldn\u2019t make her cold?\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t be in shorts but the way OP wants her bundled up is ridiculous too. And all the comments about it being fatal are ridiculous.", "Nope, read OP\u2019s post. Normal daycare was closed, mom was acting as daycare. Also, most daycares have extra clothes", "You get sick because of viruses and bacteria.  They're not spontaneously generated when you get cold.", "I think it is important because I think that they are in some ex tit for tat thing. \n\nOne is being over dramatic. I mean 4 days earlier kids where in Xmas dresses which is not that much warmer than a sweater and shorts and no one died.   \n\nThe other one is being an AH by dressing her that way. I bet he did it to be petty AF. \n\nI just feel bad for the kid.  But all the adults here are AH."]}
