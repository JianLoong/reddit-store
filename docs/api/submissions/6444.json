We also talked about how I want to make it because then I know it is exactly what I want and is also hand crafted and not a cast mount (this is how most rings are made these days, which is fine for most people) it would also be substantially cheaper for me to make it compared to buying one from a jeweller, so I could also have more ring for less money. As this is my literal job he agreed and said it wasn\u2019t traditional but sounded romantic at the same time. \n\nOn NYE he proposed. I of course was delighted and said yes. Then he pulled out a ring. I could tell in the box it wasn\u2019t a cheap place holder ring to wear whilst I made the real thing. It\u2019s also exactly what I didn\u2019t want, a solitaire round diamond on a cast white gold band (if that\u2019s your style great! I\u2019ve made enough of them over the years, but it\u2019s everything I didn\u2019t want). \n\nI didn\u2019t say anything on the night obviously, but the next day I sat him down and asked him why he bought it when we had agreed on me making it. He said it was traditional for the man to get the ring and that I should be happy he got me one. He\u2019s also spent 4x what it would have cost me to make it. \n\nShort version is I told him, whilst I appreciate him wanting to be romantic and get me a ring, this isn\u2019t what I wanted, the cost is disproportionate and we should look at returning it and having me make another ring. He called me ungrateful and I should just be glad he got me a ring and that I would learn to like it. \n\nIf I\u2019m the one wearing it, I need to like it, this is something I tell every person I do a ring commission for, and he knows this. \n\nHe\u2019s agreed to return it (thankfully he can) and let me source the materials and stones to make up the ring, but he\u2019s really not happy.

He disregarded all that and did what he wanted anyway. Then he doubled down and defended what he did. You won, but he is holding that against you. Is he usually like this? Does he have a habit of trying to make you do things his way? This whole story seems like foreshadowing.\n\nThose words \"you will learn to like it\" are particularly chilling.", "NTA - I also work in fine jewelry so when it came time to talk engagement my SO was thrilled with the fact that I would play a part. We had a BLAST doing custom rings. My diamond and the ring itself get tons of compliments. Thankfully he was secure enough in his masculinity that it didn\u2019t topple over a ring.\n\nUpdate - we also saved a ton of money because I used gold I had and my favorite part is I got to use my grandmothers wedding band in it. She died in 2020 so I love having a piece of her incorporated into my wedding.", "NTA\n\nWhile it's good that your fianc\u00e9 has finally agreed to return the ring and ~~let you make your own~~ is respecting a decision you made together, his whole attitude about this is concerning:\n\n>He said it was traditional for the man to get the ring and that I should be happy he got me one.  \n>  \n>He called me ungrateful and I should just be glad he got me a ring and that I would learn to like it.\n\nSo he agreed on the plan for you to make your own ring, does a 180 and pulls out this bullshit as some kind of defence? You're not 'ungrateful' and you shouldn't have to make do with a ring you don't like because of this ridiculous idea that women should be thankful that the man in their life is buying them expensive stuff.\n\nI hope he doesn't behave like this in other aspects of your relationship.", "No I don't think you are the asshole here. You both discussed this before time, you can make it cheaper, etc. \nWhat worries me is him saying you will learn to like it and that it's traditional for the man to buy the ring. Is he normally traditional or is this a new change?", "NTA. You communicated clearly, in detail, and in advance, and he disregarded all of it for some outdated notion of what the man does. And then he wanted you to be grateful. . Your situation is unique, which he chose not to honor. Will he ever really see you or hear what you have to say? Perhaps it's for the best that this happened so you have the chance to determine if the issues can be resolved before you make a legal commitment.", "NTA\nNot only did he disregard the plans you had made together on this, he completely ignored (never even listened to?) your expressed preferences on the matter, and gave you a ring you hate, all in the name of \u201ctradition\u201d, AND then when you asked him about it, he\u2019s \u201cnot happy\u201d? Girl. I sincerely hope this doesn\u2019t represent everything about your partnership.", "NTA You couldn't have been more clear, or for it to be more obvious that you should make your own ring. I'd be concerned over his inability to not just see that, but that he takes offense to you knowing exactly what you want.", "NTA.  You were very clear and he completely disregarded your wishes.", "NTA\n\nHe'll need to learn to defer to your tastes in jewelry, especially as you're an expert. He's got to put aside pride and \"tradition\" here.\n\nMy wife? I never buy her jewelry. And it's not because I don't care, it's because _I get it wrong every time_. She's got specific tastes! Tastes I don't fully understand. So it makes no sense for me to buy her things she won't enjoy.\n\nIt goes both ways. She knows I enjoy tech stuff, but she knows nothing about it\u2014so she doesn't buy me any of those things.\n\nIf you want to have giving of gifts as part of the relationship, what works for us is having lists of specific things we want or categories of things we always like, e.g., \"this particular piece of jewelry OR a meal at favorite restaurant X\".", "NTA and seriously even if he bought a ring because he liked that better. Shouldn\u2019t that ring look at least close to what you like?\n\nAnd I might add: \u201eit\u2019s worth 4 times what you would pay for it\u201c - Yeah that was one of the points you wanted to make it yourself.", "NTA. You had an agreement, period.", "NTA. You had agreed on something else. As for traditions, your fianc\u00e9e needs to get over himself.", "NTA, why should you just be glad he got you a ring? It's something you have to wear forever (in theory) and you shouldn't have to think \"this isn't the ring I wanted\" or \"I really don't like this ring\" every time you look at it. Just my opinion but it seems to me that underpinning that message is \"you should just be grateful I proposed\"... maybe it's not that deep, but it would make me think twice.", "NTA. Wtf is wrong with him. You couldn\u2019t have been anymore specific than you were. He completely disregarded your wants and desires for his own ego. Then had the nerve to insult you when you said something about it. And the whole \u2018you\u2019ll learn to like it\u2019 sounds abusive and honestly terrifying. What else will he say that to?", "NTA, and I have to ask, is this the only thing he thinks you should be \"grateful\" for? Because that's not cool. You told him exactly what you wanted and how you wanted to do it, and he went and did the exact opposite and expected you to do cartwheels because he spent a shit-ton of money on something you don't want to wear?", "NTA. I\u2019m a goldsmith as well. I made my rings. I convinced my husband (cheapskate) that I could save him lots of money. I don\u2019t know why anyone would pay retail when they can pay wholesale.", "NTA\n\nboils down to you telling him what you wanted, and him ignoring your needs and doing what he wanted anyway", "NTA, but a lot of red flags for your relationship. You had an understandable, logical agreement, he went and broke it. Now he is trying to justify this with tradition and trying to make you the guilty person because you are \"ungrateful\"? What a manipulator! And his demand to keep it and you will \"learn to love it\" just proves how stupid and entitled he is. No, especially after this comment the ring will forever remind you that he completely disregards your feelings, your taste, the agreement you made (and that will probably apply to future agreements, I would fear) and his shitty comment. I would give the ring back as it is already kind of burned and take some time to rethink the whole marriage thing again, before you enter a legal partnership that doesn't quite fit your needs, wants and feelings.", "NTA, but when things have calmed down a lot ask him if he was under peer pressure from someone about this?\n\nif not this is a huge red flag, you don't have to be grateful because someone did something they know you didn't want.", "NTA\n\nHe totally disregarded everything you said! What\u2019s the point of communication if he doesn\u2019t listen. \n\nWhy did he do it? For what? Pride? \n\nDid he make the ring about himself? \u201cYou should be grateful for me spending all this money on something you don\u2019t like.\u201d I am sorry but your future husband should fucking care if you like your ring and it\u2019s really concerning that he didn\u2019t give a shit about what you wanted when he picked it. He basically thought \u201cthis is good enough so she better like it.\u201d\n\nThis is a red flag. Be weary of his actions during the wedding planning.", "you are NTA. My late husbands father was a master jeweler so when we where talking marriage hubby asked I wanted I said marriage had never been my thing but I loved designing jewelry so I had designed one when I was younger and worked at a jewelry factory where I wanted our two birthstones to surrounds small Diamond interlocking so engagement was Diamond and gemstone side was wrapped as two small bands around it as wedding. His dad said he could do it. I got the Diamond engagement but ring was going to be a surprise. It was a surprise alright, was a replica of his dad\u2019s which was channel set gold nuggets in a mens width. I resented and did not wear it at all, am a mechanic as well as massage/esthetician yeah I know they do not match lol so I always told people that was why I did not wear ring. Late husband said he would get me my dream ring on our 20th but he passed before then. I gave rings to daughter and commissioned my dream one made with a Diamond made from his ashes which coincidentally is daughters birthstone and wrapped in our birthstones. I hardly wear but when I do is on right hand. But I never grew to love my actual wedding band.", "NTA\n\nYou both spoke about this beforehand, and a sensible agreement was reached. Your partner then did the complete opposite! I\u2019d be annoyed too.\n\nThe ring I wear now was my grandmothers. I love it. I lost my original engagement ring lol but my husband lost his wedding ring on our honeymoon so it evened out lol. We\u2019ve been married since 2001, got engaged in 1999. \n\nIt\u2019s your finger, you have to wear it, so liking the ring is really important.", "NTA but i would seriously sit down and think about this encounter. even if picturing it happening to someone else helps contextualize it from an outside pov. cuz personally this is sounding a lot like\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA this isn't about the ring or the cost but rather that he disrespected your clearly expressed wishes and did something he knew would be contrary to what you had *both agreed* upon!", "NTA.\n\nHe \\_knew\\_ you wanted to make your own ring and just simply disregarded your wishes because of some outdated \"tradition\" that was invented by the diamond industry to get men to spend several times their monthly wage.\n\nIf he's that obtuse, what else does he do that ignores your clearly spelled out and agreed upon wishes?", "Nta", "Hearty NTA.  \"You'll learn to like it\" is bollocks and smacks a bit narcicistically - did he think he knew better for you, or that your opinion couldnt be trusted?  Most women who *aren't* in the industry have very specific taste, I don't know a single one who would want a style forced on them they'd be wearing every day.  I love looking at my low bezel set emerald cut knowing my husband took my words to heart.  We are very traditional this has nothing to do with that. Getting what we had agreed on makes the whole affair touching in a way a tall dinner plate on my finger just wouldn't.  Its not about the money its about the consideration.  I'm glad he changed his tune but his approach is a bit *yikes*", "NTA.  But I have the feeling this whole marriage probably isn\u2019t a good idea.  You\u2019re not really on the same wavelength and I don\u2019t think he really has appreciation for your work.   This guy just doesn\u2019t get it and tying your life to his could really hold you back.   Please don\u2019t marry this one.   He\u2019s not going to be worth it.", "NTA. I\u2019m also a jeweler. I wasn\u2019t when my husband proposed, but my mom has worked at a jewelry store for 15 years. If he didn\u2019t go to my mom to get it, I would\u2019ve been upset. It\u2019s just silly to pay retail when you can get it at cost (or in my case, a significant family discount because you\u2019re marrying the daughter of their manager of 15 years). Now that I\u2019m a jeweler too it\u2019d just be silly not to work with your partner who does this as a living - they know exactly what they want! Although I don\u2019t understand your opposition to cast rings, you know what you want, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting what you want.", "NTA. It's awful that he would ignore the agreement you both made. I'd be reconsidering the \"yes\" to his proposal, personally.", "NTA\n\nI hate to waive the marinara flag but he completely ignored a detailed conversation and previous agreement in favor of tradition?? Please keep your eyes open during your engagement. I really hope this was aberrational behavior on his part rather than his baseline.", "NTA but you need to figure out where that sentiment came from. \n\nIf it\u2019s him deciding that he\u2019s the man and has to choose the ring whatever your feelings are, that\u2019s a red flag. \n\nIt seems more likely (especially since he was on board before) that someone got in his ear and told him that of course you\u2019d want him to pick it out and that you\u2019re just being considerate about money by offering to make it.", "NTA, but your bf is. I highly recommend taking the time to reflect on how the rest of your life with him may play out. Do you really want to be attached to someone who completely ignored your feelings, knowledge, and preferences, then called you names? What if you have children? Will he agree with you on parenting, then go on to unilateral decisions because clearly he knows best (/s)? Please have an honest conversation with yourself, then have an honest conversation with him. Life is too short and the world is too shitty to spend time with assholes.", "Nope NTA he sure is, knowing it is your profession and all and knowing your thoughts about it.", "NTA\n\nAs a person who spent the whole first year of her marriage arguing about the ring I wanted and getting it on our first anniversary - I completely understand. \n\n(1940s 3/4 carat barely perceptible setting with four side stones - it throws rainbows everywhere) \n\nHe's being a doofus and will learn over time.\n\nAlso you can get together a list of status items he may want over the future (cars or whatever his poison) and have him understand that you getting what you want now is the essential precursor to him getting things that matter to him later.\n\nThis is a passion for you - I'm actually cross on your behalf that he's taken no interest in it as yet.\n\nOh, and just in case you are wondering, we are going strong at 21 years married", "NTA, sounds like he needs some training to let go of this toxic masculinity...", "What type of ring did you buy him?", "NTA - Op, let this be a look into what your marriage will look like. 5, 10, 20 years down the line at the end of the day your opinion and feelings don\u2019t matter, just his wants. I highly doubt this is the first time hes done something like this and even if it is the fact he would do so for such a large offense is concerning. Please think long and hard on if this is the life you want. Good luck OP.", "Here\u2019s the part that got my eyebrows up: \n\n\u201cHe called me ungrateful and I should just be glad he got me a ring and that I would learn to like it.\u201d \n\nWhat? Does this guy have a pattern and history of running roughshod over people\u2019s stated wishes? If he actually likes you, you saying \u201cI can\u2019t stand cast white gold with a solitaire\u201d and then receiving cast white gold with a solitaire is like a personal insult. Not only is it an aesthetic (style) error, but a financial one (paying 4x what it would cost OP to do the one they actually want). This just screams a lifetime of poor decision-making skills. \n\nMeanwhile, OP is an actual jewelry designer. The ring they wear is like a freaking business card for OP\u2019s style, quality of work product, and ability. People who consult them should be able to see the embodiment of their creativity and execution on their hand, the same way that we\u2019re always interested to see the choices interior designers make on their own homes, or the personal cars of race car drivers. Any jewelry OP wears will come under scrutiny. It shouldn\u2019t be basic. NTA.\nEdit: typo", "NTA, you had an agreement.\nBut why didn't just you propose yourself (with your ring)?", "NTA, I understand why his feelings might be hurt, but he brought it on his self.", "NTA! My husband knew better than to do this. He proposed without a ring and then my silversmith brother made the ring that I actually wanted (at cost so I had to force him to accept more money because siblings..). He made my wedding ring as well so they fit perfectly together and it makes it that much more special that he made them. My husband knew I'd want my brother to make my rings, he listened to me and he respected my opinion. I'd think carefully about how your fiance going directly against what you wanted makes you feel and see if you can't have a proper discussion about that and why he thinks his feelings matter more than yours here.", "NTA! I\u2019m not a jeweller but I knew what I wanted, and my now husband proposed with a placeholder ring. He even apologised because he couldn\u2019t find something better suited for my style, but obviously it wasn\u2019t an issue since we would be replacing it. It was so much fun to go pick out the rings together!\n\nThis is about respect, seeing you as an equal partner, and listening. He\u2019s lacking in all three. You don\u2019t sound like the type who wants to do things the way \u201cthey were always done\u201d, are you sure you should be looking for that in a partner?", "NTA, good luck, being married to that man", "NTA\nWhat other \"traditional\" roles is he planning to foist on you when you're married? This really does not bode well for your future together. You were clear about everything, he agreed, and now he's calling you ungrateful when he ignored your expressed wishes? No bueno.", "NTA, but do you really want to marry someone with such disregard for your feelings/wants, just because, \u201cman tradition?\u201d", "Yes", "YTA why don\u2019t you also go ahead and propose to yourself. What you want, me, me, me is all that comes across. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t you make the ring already and put it somewhere for him to use once he was ready to propose? \n\nI do agree he should return the ring and call this relationship done.", "Am I tripping or?? YTA. Like homie an engagement ring is something a person chooses for their partner. He probably took a lot of time to find something he thought you\u2019d like. I understand it\u2019s your job but I mean if you wanted to make your own ring so bad then why not just buy all the materials yourself, make it beforehand and give it to him like here: propose to me. It takes the whole point of the engagement ring which is, i\u2019m purchasing this ring to show you that I love you and I want to be with you??", "In a few words - YTAH- I don\u2019t know what this trend is lately with the recipient believing THEY should determine price and pick out the ring- traditionally- cut style (solitaire vs multi stone) preferences, setting type was discussed- ie round vs brilliant, cushion, oval etc- but the cost was left to the proposer/purchaser. \nI can\u2019t imagine accepting the ring/proposal and then insisting the ring is returned and changed to a bigger stone, different setting, or higher cost. \nThe ring is a symbol of the love and commitment between the couple- or should be. \nIf I proposed to someone and they did that - it would end the engagement and relationship. \nThose purchasing the ring typically save for a long time, spend a lot of time searching for  THE ring, planning the proposal and it feels like a slap in the face to basically tell someone you supposedly love - sorry not good enough.", "ESH\n\nThe entire significance of the engagement ring is that it's a gift chosen by your SO for you. Choosing (or in this case, making) it yourself removes all the symbolism and makes the whole thing entirely materialistic.\n\nYour boyfriend sucks though because it seems he went along with the idea of letting you make your ring, only to change his mind without consulting you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Their stake in the decision is not equal. \n\nAnd it would be a daily wear item. For her. Their stake in the decision is not equal for this reason too. \n\nTo buy an overly-expensive and ugly ring that is so inappropriate the only decision is \u201cdon\u2019t wear it very often\u201d, when she is willing & able to design herself a custom item that she would want to wear every day, is a mind-bogglingly idiotic decision. \n\nThe worst bit though is that they discussed it clearly in advance, and he decided to ignore her wishes because \u201cshe would learn to like doing things his way\u201d. \n\nThat\u2019s practically a relationship ending mindset. It\u2019s definitely incredibly concerning.", "Ignoring jointly made decisions and clearly spelled out wishes is not harmless.", "If it was so important to him, he would have gotten a ring OP likes. She doesn't like the white gold band, yet he went right ahead and got it like there was no other bands available. She doesn't want a solitaire stone, yet here we are...!\n\nI am sure OP would have been less upset if he had at least listened to what kind of band and stones she wants. But nah, he can just ignore it all because she should be grateful he even got her a ring - his words.", "it\u2019s not exactly harmless and has to do with misogyny but anyway, he wasted so much money on a ring she doesn\u2019t even like because he decided to ignore his partner\u2019s wants and follow tradition. That\u2019s incredibly stupid. \u201cWhy are his feelings less important than yours?\u201d He literally ignored everything OP said after they already talked about it just so HE could feel better about himself and follow the tradition, he clearly didn\u2019t care about OPs feelings when he went out and bought a ring.", "Seriously, if a tradition doesn't serve me, I don't follow it. My fiance and I are planning a long engagement so I asked him if he wanted his own engagement ring. He was taken aback at first because it's not traditional, but thought it over and decided he did want a ring. He's got a really cool opal and meteorite ring and he's gotten nothing but compliments on it.", "NTA. You had agreed on something else. As for traditions, your fianc\u00e9e needs to get over himself.", "NTA\n\nboils down to you telling him what you wanted, and him ignoring your needs and doing what he wanted anyway", "You two need to sit down and talk about why he disregarded your agreement.  If this is going to be a habit (agreeing then denying), you have some thinking to do.  If he never listened in the first place, but just went along, you still have some thinking to do.  But the \"learn to like it\" comment, that's really disturbing.", "NTA because, op made her point and her fiance completely overruled her demands.", "NTA. It's awful that he would ignore the agreement you both made. I'd be reconsidering the \"yes\" to his proposal, personally.", "I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t get to have this experience. We had so much fun with both rings. His is custom too. My ring is the lotus flower, his are the roots. Once he started looking at stones he realized he likes opals so it has a small fire opal inset that the \u201croots\u201d go out from. (We will see how long this opal lasts! Lolol So far he loves his ring so much he takes very good care of it but opals\u2026)", "I love handcrafted things! The head is a double pronged Lotus flower shape. The band is interwoven vines one being polished the other matte. It\u2019s white gold. The diamond is a cushion cut, it throws rainbows like crazy!", "It's not about luck. It's because their partner isn't shit, while yours is. That's who you are choosing to marry. It's got nothing to do with luck.", "I don't even know what \"greenfinger\" means! All the more reason I just defer to my wife's requests. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThe nicest jewelry-adjacent thing I ever bought her was some kind of jewelry polish liquid, so at least the things she owns look shiny and new.", "As an artist, it just means more to have a one of a kind, sentimental ring. Why go for generic when you can have artistry and unique?", "Even if you weren\u2019t a goldsmith this would still be an issue. You have to wear the ring ideally everyday for the rest of your life. AND! Had already discussed this! Your preference matters more than his here. And he totally ignored all of that and is being dismissive of your feelings. Don\u2019t get married if this is going to be what your marriage is like.", "Why didn't she propose herself?\nI can't find nothing in the post regarding this.", "Sure, and lots of people also pick their own Christmas presents but ultimately the most significant presents will always be those that are thoughtfully chosen for the recipient.", "How is he like when it comes to gifts, such as anniversary, Christmas, or anniversary gifts?", "You are ignoring a major red flag, and for what?", "Hon, you're ignoring the elephant in the room.", "Nope NTA he sure is, knowing it is your profession and all and knowing your thoughts about it.", "Oh wow I love what you guys have done there! You never know depending on how sterile he is the fire Opal may last! If not it\u2019s easy to replace. \n\nI\u2019ve always loved target style rings but wanted to make sure any stones were rub over set, because of my work they would just get battered otherwise. So planned to do rub over with decorative millgrain on the centre then do an octagonal target with more millgrain all in yellow gold. Could have had all the design elements I wanted whilst still being practical.", "Oh it's just what I call my fingers if the rings have copper in them - it reacts with your skin.\n\nThe polish is a great idea!l though!", "Not just that, if a client asks if she made her ring and she says no, it's just awkward sometimes.", "I see your point but I doubt the kind of man that doesn\u2019t want to save money by his goldsmith partner making their own ring, would accept a proposal from her. He claims to be traditional", "\u201cThe most significant presents will always be those that are thoughtfully chosen for the recipient.\u201d In this sentence, the word \u201cthoughtfully\u201d carries far more weight than the word \u201cfor\u201d. It is far more important that the gift is thoughtful than that it is chosen FOR (as in, without the active input of) the recipient. This was not thoughtfully chosen.", "Was this ring thoughtfully chosen?", "That sounds so amazing!!!!! I LOVE millgrain. I tried to work that into mine but it clashed a bit and would have been a bit busy. It\u2019s so cool that you can make your ring and his! That is sooo special and unique to your relationship. I\u2019m sorry he didn\u2019t celebrate that more.", "He knew she wanted yellow gold. He bought white gold. She had the design. He ignored that too.\n\nDoes that sound thoughtfully chosen?", "Well he bought a ring \ud83d\udc8d \n\nFun aside no it was not thoughtful it was \u201cmy manhood is hurt if you make the ring\u201d"]}
