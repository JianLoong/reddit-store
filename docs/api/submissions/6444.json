We also talked about how I want to make it because then I know it is exactly what I want and is also hand crafted and not a cast mount (this is how most rings are made these days, which is fine for most people) it would also be substantially cheaper for me to make it compared to buying one from a jeweller, so I could also have more ring for less money. As this is my literal job he agreed and said it wasn\u2019t traditional but sounded romantic at the same time. \n\nOn NYE he proposed. I of course was delighted and said yes. Then he pulled out a ring. I could tell in the box it wasn\u2019t a cheap place holder ring to wear whilst I made the real thing. It\u2019s also exactly what I didn\u2019t want, a solitaire round diamond on a cast white gold band (if that\u2019s your style great! I\u2019ve made enough of them over the years, but it\u2019s everything I didn\u2019t want). \n\nI didn\u2019t say anything on the night obviously, but the next day I sat him down and asked him why he bought it when we had agreed on me making it. He said it was traditional for the man to get the ring and that I should be happy he got me one. He\u2019s also spent 4x what it would have cost me to make it. \n\nShort version is I told him, whilst I appreciate him wanting to be romantic and get me a ring, this isn\u2019t what I wanted, the cost is disproportionate and we should look at returning it and having me make another ring. He called me ungrateful and I should just be glad he got me a ring and that I would learn to like it. \n\nIf I\u2019m the one wearing it, I need to like it, this is something I tell every person I do a ring commission for, and he knows this. \n\nHe\u2019s agreed to return it (thankfully he can) and let me source the materials and stones to make up the ring, but he\u2019s really not happy.

He disregarded all that and did what he wanted anyway. Then he doubled down and defended what he did. You won, but he is holding that against you. Is he usually like this? Does he have a habit of trying to make you do things his way? This whole story seems like foreshadowing.\n\nThose words \"you will learn to like it\" are particularly chilling.", "NTA - I also work in fine jewelry so when it came time to talk engagement my SO was thrilled with the fact that I would play a part. We had a BLAST doing custom rings. My diamond and the ring itself get tons of compliments. Thankfully he was secure enough in his masculinity that it didn\u2019t topple over a ring.\n\nUpdate - we also saved a ton of money because I used gold I had and my favorite part is I got to use my grandmothers wedding band in it. She died in 2020 so I love having a piece of her incorporated into my wedding.", "NTA\n\nWhile it's good that your fianc\u00e9 has finally agreed to return the ring and ~~let you make your own~~ is respecting a decision you made together, his whole attitude about this is concerning:\n\n>He said it was traditional for the man to get the ring and that I should be happy he got me one.  \n>  \n>He called me ungrateful and I should just be glad he got me a ring and that I would learn to like it.\n\nSo he agreed on the plan for you to make your own ring, does a 180 and pulls out this bullshit as some kind of defence? You're not 'ungrateful' and you shouldn't have to make do with a ring you don't like because of this ridiculous idea that women should be thankful that the man in their life is buying them expensive stuff.\n\nI hope he doesn't behave like this in other aspects of your relationship.", "No I don't think you are the asshole here. You both discussed this before time, you can make it cheaper, etc. \nWhat worries me is him saying you will learn to like it and that it's traditional for the man to buy the ring. Is he normally traditional or is this a new change?", "NTA. You communicated clearly, in detail, and in advance, and he disregarded all of it for some outdated notion of what the man does. And then he wanted you to be grateful. . Your situation is unique, which he chose not to honor. Will he ever really see you or hear what you have to say? Perhaps it's for the best that this happened so you have the chance to determine if the issues can be resolved before you make a legal commitment.", "NTA\n\nNot only did he disregard the plans you had made together on this, he completely ignored (never even listened to?) your expressed preferences on the matter, and gave you a ring you hate, all in the name of \u201ctradition\u201d, AND then when you asked him about it, he\u2019s \u201cnot happy\u201d? Girl. I sincerely hope this doesn\u2019t represent everything about your partnership.\n\nTLDR; this is at best utter incompetence and financial irresponsibility; at worst it\u2019s a very manipulative move which completely disregards OP\u2019s thoughts and feelings, and almost dares her to object.", "NTA You couldn't have been more clear, or for it to be more obvious that you should make your own ring. I'd be concerned over his inability to not just see that, but that he takes offense to you knowing exactly what you want.", "NTA.  You were very clear and he completely disregarded your wishes.", "NTA\n\nHe'll need to learn to defer to your tastes in jewelry, especially as you're an expert. He's got to put aside pride and \"tradition\" here.\n\nMy wife? I never buy her jewelry. And it's not because I don't care, it's because _I get it wrong every time_. She's got specific tastes! Tastes I don't fully understand. So it makes no sense for me to buy her things she won't enjoy.\n\nIt goes both ways. She knows I enjoy tech stuff, but she knows nothing about it\u2014so she doesn't buy me any of those things.\n\nIf you want to have giving of gifts as part of the relationship, what works for us is having lists of specific things we want or categories of things we always like, e.g., \"this particular piece of jewelry OR a meal at favorite restaurant X\".", "NTA and seriously even if he bought a ring because he liked that better. Shouldn\u2019t that ring look at least close to what you like?\n\nAnd I might add: \u201eit\u2019s worth 4 times what you would pay for it\u201c - Yeah that was one of the points you wanted to make it yourself.", "NTA. You had an agreement, period.", "NTA. You had agreed on something else. As for traditions, your fianc\u00e9e needs to get over himself.", "NTA, why should you just be glad he got you a ring? It's something you have to wear forever (in theory) and you shouldn't have to think \"this isn't the ring I wanted\" or \"I really don't like this ring\" every time you look at it. Just my opinion but it seems to me that underpinning that message is \"you should just be grateful I proposed\"... maybe it's not that deep, but it would make me think twice.", "NTA. Wtf is wrong with him. You couldn\u2019t have been anymore specific than you were. He completely disregarded your wants and desires for his own ego. Then had the nerve to insult you when you said something about it. And the whole \u2018you\u2019ll learn to like it\u2019 sounds abusive and honestly terrifying. What else will he say that to?", "NTA, and I have to ask, is this the only thing he thinks you should be \"grateful\" for? Because that's not cool. You told him exactly what you wanted and how you wanted to do it, and he went and did the exact opposite and expected you to do cartwheels because he spent a shit-ton of money on something you don't want to wear?", "NTA. I\u2019m a goldsmith as well. I made my rings. I convinced my husband (cheapskate) that I could save him lots of money. I don\u2019t know why anyone would pay retail when they can pay wholesale.", "NTA\n\nboils down to you telling him what you wanted, and him ignoring your needs and doing what he wanted anyway", "NTA, but a lot of red flags for your relationship. You had an understandable, logical agreement, he went and broke it. Now he is trying to justify this with tradition and trying to make you the guilty person because you are \"ungrateful\"? What a manipulator! And his demand to keep it and you will \"learn to love it\" just proves how stupid and entitled he is. No, especially after this comment the ring will forever remind you that he completely disregards your feelings, your taste, the agreement you made (and that will probably apply to future agreements, I would fear) and his shitty comment. I would give the ring back as it is already kind of burned and take some time to rethink the whole marriage thing again, before you enter a legal partnership that doesn't quite fit your needs, wants and feelings.", "NTA, but when things have calmed down a lot ask him if he was under peer pressure from someone about this?\n\nif not this is a huge red flag, you don't have to be grateful because someone did something they know you didn't want.", "NTA\n\nHe totally disregarded everything you said! What\u2019s the point of communication if he doesn\u2019t listen. \n\nWhy did he do it? For what? Pride? \n\nDid he make the ring about himself? \u201cYou should be grateful for me spending all this money on something you don\u2019t like.\u201d I am sorry but your future husband should fucking care if you like your ring and it\u2019s really concerning that he didn\u2019t give a shit about what you wanted when he picked it. He basically thought \u201cthis is good enough so she better like it.\u201d\n\nThis is a red flag. Be weary of his actions during the wedding planning.", "you are NTA. My late husbands father was a master jeweler so when we where talking marriage hubby asked I wanted I said marriage had never been my thing but I loved designing jewelry so I had designed one when I was younger and worked at a jewelry factory where I wanted our two birthstones to surrounds small Diamond interlocking so engagement was Diamond and gemstone side was wrapped as two small bands around it as wedding. His dad said he could do it. I got the Diamond engagement but ring was going to be a surprise. It was a surprise alright, was a replica of his dad\u2019s which was channel set gold nuggets in a mens width. I resented and did not wear it at all, am a mechanic as well as massage/esthetician yeah I know they do not match lol so I always told people that was why I did not wear ring. Late husband said he would get me my dream ring on our 20th but he passed before then. I gave rings to daughter and commissioned my dream one made with a Diamond made from his ashes which coincidentally is daughters birthstone and wrapped in our birthstones. I hardly wear but when I do is on right hand. But I never grew to love my actual wedding band.", "NTA\n\nYou both spoke about this beforehand, and a sensible agreement was reached. Your partner then did the complete opposite! I\u2019d be annoyed too.\n\nThe ring I wear now was my grandmothers. I love it. I lost my original engagement ring lol but my husband lost his wedding ring on our honeymoon so it evened out lol. We\u2019ve been married since 2001, got engaged in 1999. \n\nIt\u2019s your finger, you have to wear it, so liking the ring is really important.", "NTA but i would seriously sit down and think about this encounter. even if picturing it happening to someone else helps contextualize it from an outside pov. cuz personally this is sounding a lot like\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA this isn't about the ring or the cost but rather that he disrespected your clearly expressed wishes and did something he knew would be contrary to what you had *both agreed* upon!", "NTA.\n\nHe \\_knew\\_ you wanted to make your own ring and just simply disregarded your wishes because of some outdated \"tradition\" that was invented by the diamond industry to get men to spend several times their monthly wage.\n\nIf he's that obtuse, what else does he do that ignores your clearly spelled out and agreed upon wishes?", "Nta", "Hearty NTA.  \"You'll learn to like it\" is bollocks and smacks a bit narcicistically - did he think he knew better for you, or that your opinion couldnt be trusted?  Most women who *aren't* in the industry have very specific taste, I don't know a single one who would want a style forced on them they'd be wearing every day.  I love looking at my low bezel set emerald cut knowing my husband took my words to heart.  We are very traditional this has nothing to do with that. Getting what we had agreed on makes the whole affair touching in a way a tall dinner plate on my finger just wouldn't.  Its not about the money its about the consideration.  I'm glad he changed his tune but his approach is a bit *yikes*", "NTA.  But I have the feeling this whole marriage probably isn\u2019t a good idea.  You\u2019re not really on the same wavelength and I don\u2019t think he really has appreciation for your work.   This guy just doesn\u2019t get it and tying your life to his could really hold you back.   Please don\u2019t marry this one.   He\u2019s not going to be worth it.", "NTA. I\u2019m also a jeweler. I wasn\u2019t when my husband proposed, but my mom has worked at a jewelry store for 15 years. If he didn\u2019t go to my mom to get it, I would\u2019ve been upset. It\u2019s just silly to pay retail when you can get it at cost (or in my case, a significant family discount because you\u2019re marrying the daughter of their manager of 15 years). Now that I\u2019m a jeweler too it\u2019d just be silly not to work with your partner who does this as a living - they know exactly what they want! Although I don\u2019t understand your opposition to cast rings, you know what you want, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting what you want.", "NTA. It's awful that he would ignore the agreement you both made. I'd be reconsidering the \"yes\" to his proposal, personally.", "NTA\n\nI hate to waive the marinara flag but he completely ignored a detailed conversation and previous agreement in favor of tradition?? Please keep your eyes open during your engagement. I really hope this was aberrational behavior on his part rather than his baseline.", "NTA but you need to figure out where that sentiment came from. \n\nIf it\u2019s him deciding that he\u2019s the man and has to choose the ring whatever your feelings are, that\u2019s a red flag. \n\nIt seems more likely (especially since he was on board before) that someone got in his ear and told him that of course you\u2019d want him to pick it out and that you\u2019re just being considerate about money by offering to make it.", "NTA, but your bf is. I highly recommend taking the time to reflect on how the rest of your life with him may play out. Do you really want to be attached to someone who completely ignored your feelings, knowledge, and preferences, then called you names? What if you have children? Will he agree with you on parenting, then go on to unilateral decisions because clearly he knows best (/s)? Please have an honest conversation with yourself, then have an honest conversation with him. Life is too short and the world is too shitty to spend time with assholes.", "Nope NTA he sure is, knowing it is your profession and all and knowing your thoughts about it.", "NTA\n\nAs a person who spent the whole first year of her marriage arguing about the ring I wanted and getting it on our first anniversary - I completely understand. \n\n(1940s 3/4 carat barely perceptible setting with four side stones - it throws rainbows everywhere) \n\nHe's being a doofus and will learn over time.\n\nAlso you can get together a list of status items he may want over the future (cars or whatever his poison) and have him understand that you getting what you want now is the essential precursor to him getting things that matter to him later.\n\nThis is a passion for you - I'm actually cross on your behalf that he's taken no interest in it as yet.\n\nOh, and just in case you are wondering, we are going strong at 21 years married", "NTA, sounds like he needs some training to let go of this toxic masculinity...", "What type of ring did you buy him?", "NTA - Op, let this be a look into what your marriage will look like. 5, 10, 20 years down the line at the end of the day your opinion and feelings don\u2019t matter, just his wants. I highly doubt this is the first time hes done something like this and even if it is the fact he would do so for such a large offense is concerning. Please think long and hard on if this is the life you want. Good luck OP.", "Here\u2019s the part that got my eyebrows up: \n\n\u201cHe called me ungrateful and I should just be glad he got me a ring and that I would learn to like it.\u201d \n\nWhat? Does this guy have a pattern and history of running roughshod over people\u2019s stated wishes? If he actually likes you, you saying \u201cI can\u2019t stand cast white gold with a solitaire\u201d and then receiving cast white gold with a solitaire is like a personal insult. Not only is it an aesthetic (style) error, but a financial one (paying 4x what it would cost OP to do the one they actually want). This just screams a lifetime of poor decision-making skills. \n\nMeanwhile, OP is an actual jewelry designer. The ring they wear is like a freaking business card for OP\u2019s style, quality of work product, and ability. People who consult them should be able to see the embodiment of their creativity and execution on their hand, the same way that we\u2019re always interested to see the choices interior designers make on their own homes, or the personal cars of race car drivers. Any jewelry OP wears will come under scrutiny. It shouldn\u2019t be basic. NTA.\nEdit: typo", "NTA, you had an agreement.\nBut why didn't just you propose yourself (with your ring)?", "NTA, I understand why his feelings might be hurt, but he brought it on his self.", "NTA! My husband knew better than to do this. He proposed without a ring and then my silversmith brother made the ring that I actually wanted (at cost so I had to force him to accept more money because siblings..). He made my wedding ring as well so they fit perfectly together and it makes it that much more special that he made them. My husband knew I'd want my brother to make my rings, he listened to me and he respected my opinion. I'd think carefully about how your fiance going directly against what you wanted makes you feel and see if you can't have a proper discussion about that and why he thinks his feelings matter more than yours here.", "NTA! I\u2019m not a jeweller but I knew what I wanted, and my now husband proposed with a placeholder ring. He even apologised because he couldn\u2019t find something better suited for my style, but obviously it wasn\u2019t an issue since we would be replacing it. It was so much fun to go pick out the rings together!\n\nThis is about respect, seeing you as an equal partner, and listening. He\u2019s lacking in all three. You don\u2019t sound like the type who wants to do things the way \u201cthey were always done\u201d, are you sure you should be looking for that in a partner?", "NTA, good luck, being married to that man", "NTA\nWhat other \"traditional\" roles is he planning to foist on you when you're married? This really does not bode well for your future together. You were clear about everything, he agreed, and now he's calling you ungrateful when he ignored your expressed wishes? No bueno.", "NTA, but do you really want to marry someone with such disregard for your feelings/wants, just because, \u201cman tradition?\u201d", "Yes", "YTA why don\u2019t you also go ahead and propose to yourself. What you want, me, me, me is all that comes across. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t you make the ring already and put it somewhere for him to use once he was ready to propose? \n\nI do agree he should return the ring and call this relationship done.", "Am I tripping or?? YTA. Like homie an engagement ring is something a person chooses for their partner. He probably took a lot of time to find something he thought you\u2019d like. I understand it\u2019s your job but I mean if you wanted to make your own ring so bad then why not just buy all the materials yourself, make it beforehand and give it to him like here: propose to me. It takes the whole point of the engagement ring which is, i\u2019m purchasing this ring to show you that I love you and I want to be with you??", "In a few words - YTAH- I don\u2019t know what this trend is lately with the recipient believing THEY should determine price and pick out the ring- traditionally- cut style (solitaire vs multi stone) preferences, setting type was discussed- ie round vs brilliant, cushion, oval etc- but the cost was left to the proposer/purchaser. \nI can\u2019t imagine accepting the ring/proposal and then insisting the ring is returned and changed to a bigger stone, different setting, or higher cost. \nThe ring is a symbol of the love and commitment between the couple- or should be. \nIf I proposed to someone and they did that - it would end the engagement and relationship. \nThose purchasing the ring typically save for a long time, spend a lot of time searching for  THE ring, planning the proposal and it feels like a slap in the face to basically tell someone you supposedly love - sorry not good enough.", "ESH\n\nThe entire significance of the engagement ring is that it's a gift chosen by your SO for you. Choosing (or in this case, making) it yourself removes all the symbolism and makes the whole thing entirely materialistic.\n\nYour boyfriend sucks though because it seems he went along with the idea of letting you make your ring, only to change his mind without consulting you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We eventually got another set of rings at a different shop. It was simple, wasn't gold (I hated gold rings for some reason) and he was satisfied.\n\nThe kicker? The ring I originally wanted cost less than 400 SGD for a set. The one he got? Less than 2000 SGD. And the one I wanted was from Pandora. By no means was it ugly; I like artistic, cute rings and it was a lovely shade of rose gold (his would have just been a simple rose gold design). He says it was worth it.

On top of that, you have expertise and experience with jewellery, and therefore know how things are made and have your own specific preferences- it's your job and your skillset, and your finance should respect that. \nHaving a ring you've designed (and/or made) sounds a lot more personal and romantic than buying one off the shelf; you can put your own designs and ideas into it that encompass your relationship-- who wouldn't want that? \n\nIt sounds as though your finance has disregarded your opinion (and prior discussion) entirely for the sake of a 'tradition' you made clear you didn't want to partake in. Perhaps it's just embarrassment or anger talking (due to a feeling of rejection), but telling you to be 'glad' you got a ring and that you'll 'learn to like it' doesn't bode particularly well. For one thing, if you dislike something from the start and then add on an unpleasant memory, learning to like it is nigh on impossible.\n\nI hope for his sake your finance comes around and apologises, and realises that he's hurt you by ignoring your wishes.

I don\u2019t get that at all. \n\nPersonally, my ground rules for a ring have always been that I don\u2019t want anything expensive. Like I drew the line at $100 initially. And if my husband had decided to spend a shit ton of money on a ring just because he felt like he should, I would also have had to tell him we should take it back and get something cheaper. I just personally don\u2019t believe in dropping money on jewelry (I am not into much of anything that costs money, especially clothes and accessories). And if he had said I was ungrateful and I should expect to like it over time, like\u2026 that doesn\u2019t sound like my kind of husband. Luckily my husband and I went together to a pawn shop and ended up out the door with my perfect ring- and it was $117 all said and done. 117 is my special/lucky number anyways. And it was perfect for me and for us. I didn\u2019t have to grow to like something else that wasn\u2019t what I wanted. I was immediately in love with something that was perfect for ME. And I know a lot of us are the same way, we know what we want, and we will be more than grateful to get just that, even if our partner thinks something more expensive or bought/gifted is better in their eyes.

To me it sounds like only one person has a voice in this dynamic.\n\nSo yes, YTA", "NTA I did metal work in college. Not to the extent of making my own ring bc I am not in the field currently nor do I have studio space. But enough for me to appreciate artists work. For my wedding ring I wanted anything but traditional. I have one artist I adore and I love his work. I asked my partner for that ring set. It is a tiny tiny diamond with a gold hydrangea flower on a simple silver band. The wedding ring is a little rose gold lady bug. They stack together. I love them so much. It was important to me that my rings weren't traditional my husband cared about my feelings when it came to that. Your husband should care about your feelings more than his ego on a core value of yours.", "NTA I thought I\u2019d want my ring to be a surprise then we tried rings on for fun and I changed my mind because what I thought I would want was actually horrible on my hand. It then turned into a mission which was stressful because I didn\u2019t know what I wanted. In the end we found something I loved and had to order it which took away the surprise element - also due to the shape of the ring, my ring size went down. He kept hold of the ring for about 8 months and still surprised me but I knew it was coming. I genuinely didn\u2019t ever thing I\u2019d want a hexagon on my finger but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got!", "INFO: could you afford both? Is that what he was thinking?", "NTA, you clearly expressed what you wanted\n\nI can understand him wanting to do something special for you and surprise you, but this wasnt the way and his reaction to your reaction is unfair and he should just be able to admit he tried to do something nice but got it wrong.", "N t a\n\nYou were clear and he ignored that.

Genuinely what could he have possibly been thinking?? Good intentions arent good if they completely disregard a very clearly stated and well discussed desire. \n\nEverything about this is just complete and total disregard for you as a person and a professional. That hes unhappy about returning the ring just reinforces this. \n\nYou are absolutely NTA but you might be (to yourself) if you marry him without really working this out and sorting whether or not this is just something that happened cos making big life changes is stressful af and we all sometimes do shitty things under stress, or if this is really what hes like and your future together will just be more of it", "NTA. At least your fianc\u00e9 showed you who he was before you got married.

It didn't exist, so I had it custom made.\n\nShe's extremely low maintenance, but yeah, this is something that you wear for a long time to come and want to be happy with it.\n\nAs a guy, I have to say this is kinda a red flag. Like, I totally get where he's coming from. But it should have been a joint thing where you make the setting then give him the ring and he gets you Stone you want or something like that.\n\nChoosing his ego vs. your very specific desire is not a great sign especially given his age where there's not much room for emotional growth.", "You\u2019re NTA.

Even though I know what I want it's not something that's important to me but i understand why and how it's important to others. If my boyfriend didn't get me exactly what I wanted I would know it wasn't malicious because the surprise is more important to me and that man can't take a hint to save his life.

He is completely in the wrong about how he acted, and how he's continuing to act, but it might be coming from somewhere that's more complicated than he realizes (and more complicated than just \"the man should provide\"). \n\nI guess I feel bad asking this because, again, his actions are terrible and none of this is at all your fault, but since this is apparently \"important\" to him on some level: Have you tried to think of some way for him to be involved in the process?

The way he's acting isn't very partner-like of him and you two need to have a serious talk about that.", "NTA also I'm wondering who put the thought in his head he needed to do this. The \"learn to like it\" thing is very unsettling and if this was a movie I'd be telling the girl to get the hell out of the house cause that's some strong foreshadowing.", "Buy him an ugly sweater/pants/beanie/jewellery anything really in a style he doesn't like and tell him he now must wear it every day for the rest of his life but he'll learn to love it.", "Sounds like youre about to marry an idiot haha.

Potentially felt a bit emasculated because you having the choice breaks gender roles, but that is his problem. Wasting 4x as much on a lead up to a wedding and telling you you'll learn to love it to protect his ego is hoisting the red flag high", "NTA. You talked about it and he did it anyway? That says a lot about him. I don't know anythig about jewelry but I do know what I like. I hate the idea of wearing something that I don't even like everyday. My bf wants to choose the ring, because he likes the element of surprise and the excitement and I agreed but I showed him what I absolutely hate first.", "You're NTA. That'd be like if my husband got me a gold band ring with a huge gaudy diamond when I told him I wanted silver, dainty jewelry.

As an absolute lover of all things jewellery and stones - this makes my blood boil...you should absolutely not have to \" learn to love it \" or \" be grateful he even got you something\" ! I'm sorry but that's a wretched thing to say to the person who you're going to spend your life with about such an important and sentimental piece of jewellery... I think the problem here is a lot bigger than the ring , and more about disregard for your intelligence, skill set, wants and desires. NTA , If you keep this man and relationship, at the very least I hope you insist on either repurposing the metal and stones for what you want , or insist on selling it and using the money to design the ring you wanted.", "NTA. You discussed it up front and you're in unique circumstances as a jeweller. If you were a wedding dress designer, you wouldn't buy one off the peg from your local dress shop! His intentions are positive, I guess, but there's a display of not hearing and insisting on winning the argument that look like warning lights to me.", "NTA....but I don't really think he is *trying* to be either. Your situation is very unique. You're a jeweler, not only do you make jewelry you also repair it. You know more about jewelry (what lasts and what doesn't, what's good quality and what isn't ect) than the average person.\nUnfortunately when it comes to jewelry your fiance is the average person. In addition to being the average person he also feels the societal pressure and expectation to provide you with a ring he bought. \n\nWould it be possible to involve him in the process of making your ring? Maybe get his opinion/help here and there?  Or maybe ask his help in designing the wedding bands (if you're wanting to make those as well)\nSomething that helps him feel involved and active in the process?", "NTA. I\u2019m not gonna say things like \u201cthis is a sign he will disrespect you through your marriage\u201d because I don\u2019t know anything about you people and your relationship. \n\nBut the vibes this story gives\u2026 like the part he knows what you want, seems to agree to it but then when he has the chance to make a statement he chooses a \u201ctradition\u201d over your preferences\u2026 a tradition about \u201cbeing a man\u201d and \u201cproviding\u201d something to you. Saying that \u201cyou should be grateful\u201d and the meaning behind it something like \u201cbecause he cared enough about you to spend money on you\u201d? \n\nAlso saying \u201cyou will learn to like it\u201d? When it is everything you didn\u2019t want and he knew that, just because he bought it? And the part which gave me the ick is, you might really \u201clearn to like it\u201d IF THIS WASN\u2019T YOUR PROFESSION. But you have a profession, which requires a lot of knowledge, talent and craftmanship on especially this area. And he is dismissive about this part too. Almost like he doesn\u2019t understand the weight of you having a profession or -actually- doesn\u2019t care/doesn\u2019t want to care about that profession, which comes with a lot of knowledge about *his* gift too.\n\nIt\u2019s like buying a rather expensive but factory-made violin to a violinist and telling them they will learn to like it when the musician would choose something handmade for maybe less money. \n\nAnd I\u2019m kind of certain he wouldn\u2019t be this dismissive if he would be gifting something to a male friend or relative that is related to the person\u2019s profession.  \n\nTry to think about this when observing his ways of communication.", "NTA. You'd both discussed it and agreed, I think someone got in his ear.", "Ok, I totally thought I was gonna vote the opposite, but NTA. He completely ignored your requests! You were very, very upfront about it.", "NTA as a goldsmith myself I would be pissed if my BF didn't listen to me in my expertise. This is a very common conversation I've had with my friends that the BF needs to listen to what we want in a ring and they may as well not even bother getting a ring. At least ring didn't had a GD heart shaped diamond :P\nAnyone who is not a goldsmith won't understand how much this matters to us as our job is making  engagements rings and we absolutely know what we want.", "No. NTA, absolutely not. The critical part is you discussed this exact point. He said that he was fine with you making it. I am having huge trouble getting over this. Does this mean he is going to ignore your wishes every time you have a different opinion to him? Hugely problematic. Prima facie the money has actually nothing to do with it! Yes, you can do it better and cheaper, but even if you couldn\u2019t: you had come to an agreement and he didn\u2019t stick to it. I would be addressing this before moving forward. Good luck!", "You are very much NTA.  (1.) He completely ignored your very specific and clear wishes about something both very special and used daily, plus (2.) simultaneously disrespected your professional opinion about a huge purchase (I'd be saying the same if you were a mechanic and he bought a car without consulting you) (3.) Showed his insecurities around your line of work and (4.) Called you ungrateful and essentially told you to just get over it...and \"agreed\" to take it back - this conversation is full of red flags for emotional abuse.

For a guy, proposing is a special occasion and selection of a ring is a process of its own. Wedding ring is something completely different, those are usually considered and arranged by both, but not the engagement ring. And, yes, it is a tradition. You would be surprised how many guys want this to be a special occasion for them as well. And, seriously, making your own engagement ring or have it made in your shop? That just makes it into a formality.   \n\n\n\"Here is your ring to propose to me with\"  \n\"Ok, so I guess you will marry me then, so here you go.\"  \n\"Umm, thanks.\"  \n\n\nIf you were so hellbent on how you wanted it to look, you should have given him some ROUGH ideas or at least some options to consider and/or mix, so that he would stil get the feeling that the ring is actually from him. Otherwise you just wanted to get yourself an engagement ring and might as well have agreed to get married over breakfast.  \n\n\nAt least that's how we do it with my wife. If we wish for something, we always give the other ideas for a bit of a freedom of choice or at least several options to choose from. That way we still get the \"I picked it with love\" feeling.", "NTA. You were clear with him about what you wanted and he thought he knew better, or thought that his wishes could overrule yours. And he found out that wasn't the case.\n\nI can sort of understand that he may have had a fantasy that he could magically light on a ring that would convince you to accept his choice of ring rather than making your own - but if he's mature enough to get married, he should be mature enough to realise that telepathy doesn't exist, and can't substitute for sensible, clear communication using actual words.\n\nI'm glad he's agreed to return it, and go back to the original plan. If he continues to be 'really not happy', then that is probably best as a separate conversation, delinked if possible from this specific issue about the ring. Does he like to get his own way a lot?

So much is set on \"showing off the ring\", \"asking the perfect question\" etc etc, you just have to look at other AITA for things like \"AITA for wearing my ring when I knew someone else would get a proposal\". In reality a proposal is a whole load more significant than a ring, the ring _should_ be the inconsequential part, and yet it is a part that _HAS TO BE RIGHT_  and you threw it back in his face.\n\nThe ring is a placeholder for something he gives to you, I get you want to make it, but then it stops being that placeholder - in what way is the ring personal to him, and in what way is it something that is personal to you\n\nWeddings are a lot of bullshit \"perfection\". Many women have planned their weddings before they ever met their man, pretty much the only thing that is traditionally his choice is the ring. Think about the rest of your plans going forward into wedding planning.\n\nYou've got a really good reason to have opinions on this BUT. IT. IS. NOT. THE. MONEY. Don't say money, forget the money, money doesn't matter here AT ALL, _especially_ because he spent so much to try to make it right.\n\nThat said, you talked about it before, he didn't listen. when you argued he said you were ungrateful (true) and  \"would learn to like it\" which is stupid blind and unkind.\n\nHow do you fix this?  \nIf you make it alone then it loses any value to him, you're just going to wear something flashy that reminds him for the rest of your marriage that he wasn't good enough.  \nIf you keep the original ring then you're wearing a reminder he didn't listen to you.  \nCould you make it together?", "Nta\n\nHe showed you exactly who he is.

It\u2019s that he was dismissive of what you wanted and had both agreed to and then is resentful of your reaction. I understand he may be feeling rejected when he wanted to surprise you and do something he (hopefully) thought you would like.
