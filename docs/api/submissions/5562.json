Enjoy your nice return gifts! <3", "NTA!", "Last year, my daughter made this big deal out of buying a cast iron skillet for her boyfriend, and then deciding to give it to me because he loves to cook and probably already had one. She told me, every step of the way, what she was doing, so I wasn't surprised. Then a day or two after she gave it to me, she started bemoaning the fact that when he saw it, he really would have liked it because his ex took his. I was so confused. I didn't know whether I was supposed to offer it back, or use it. It definitely didn't make me feel special in the leasy.", "NTA\n\nI wonder if your Love Language is the gifts one. It's mine and I would rather have zero gift than a thoughtless gift. I love gift giving and like most people I enjoy receiving a gift. But if it's from a close relative or friend and it's something I would never, ever use, it's so disappointing to me. Like, don't you know me well enough to know WHY it's not an appropriate gift for me?\n\nETA: Not trying to be funny here, but *in general* men want to be told exactly what gift we want, while women *typically* prefer to pick a gift that we think they want. Prime example: my dad asks what I want, I say I want a cordless screwdriver. That's what he bought me. My mom asks me what I want, and then buys me nail polish she thinks I will like. My issue comes into play because I haven't worn nail polish more than a dozen times in my entire 43 years on this earth.", "NTA, clearly.\n\nThis is a very late response. When you say he \"snapped\", what do you mean by that?", "This man sounds exactly like my EX husband. NTA", "Reminds me of Homer Simpson gifting Marge a bowling ball with his name on it.", "Next gift giving, do the same, and see how he likes it. NTA", "NTA I got a label maker.  For the containers HE bought to organize the kitchen.", "NTA.\nIt's like the year when my husband suggested getting me a Dyson that doesn't make noise.\nLike wtf? \nI told him to get me the Dyson anyway and a pair of diamond earrings \ud83d\udc4f", "Use them to block him and the kids out.", "NTA you didn\u2019t want something big, you wanted something thoughtful", "NTA.  Perhaps you've started a new christmas tradition that everyone can live with.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nThe worst gift giving behavior is buying something you want for someone else.", "NTA. the point of a gift is to think about the person your buying it for, to show you care.", "Something practical my a**. NTA. Yes, return those gifts and buy yourself something nice.", "I'm so happy we do a mini getaway and not gifts. Some of the arguments over them are just plain dumb.", "At least he didn't buy you naughty lingerie, which of course is really a gift for HIM.", "After 27 years of marriage, I or my daughter (24) has clearly specified to my clueless but caring husband exactly what I want for a gift. I\u2019m talking inexpensive, but it\u2019s still nice to get the right sweater or teapot than wait and see him get me something totally wrong. Also, when we\u2019re broke, we go without and just spend time together.", "NTA, but I do think you are over reacting a bit. My husband has done the same thing several times, intentional or not. My husband was in fact well meaning and had good intentions behind the gifts. I might not love them, but I also know why he\u2019s chosen it. Maybe it is me, I\u2019m never been one crazy about gifts. If it matters to you or it is your love language then you need to talk about it with him once he has cool down.", "I remember my ex always saying he didn't know what to get me for Christmases and birthdays, he tried and got me some nice things but he was always complaining he didn't know what to get me. So one year around June I made a list of books he could choose from for my July birthday and gave it to him, with specific instructions that if he bought the first item on the list it had to be before the 3rd of August because it was a preorder with some bonus gifts. Come September he gives me my gift and sure enough, it's that book \u2014 bought in late August so no preorder, no additional stickers or anything. \n\n\nSame year comes Christmas, and he tells me all excitedly that he got me a book that was not not on the list, but he's proud of it \u2013 and wouldn't you know it, I had *reasons* for not putting that book on my list. I was pretty disappointed, I know he had good intentions but I was still sad he got me something I didn't want in the first place. The same carelessness is the reason why he became an ex less than 6 months later.", "He doesn't seem to care what you think of him either, to the point where you felt so dismissed and unimportant that you felt the need to seek out further opinion at all (and even came at it from the angle of \"which of us is being the ah here\", not \"my husband is an AH look what he got 'me' for Christmas\"), so I wouldn't go bragging so loudly about that kind of \"personality\" if I was him.", "Considering she'll have to take time to go and make a return, nothing would have been better.", "I gave my best friend a waffle iron once, because she had been talking about how she missed waffles, including making them. Self serving (I got yummy waffles!), but something she actually wanted and still uses today, almost a decade later. And a few days ago, I installed a new toilet seat for my father as a Christmas gift. He'd just never gotten around to replacing the one with only half a lid, and actually loved the idea. And he already has most things he needs anyway.\n\nHowever, giving something that is solely for your own benefit, is a gift to yourself. No denying that fact.", "Say what you want, but I would love to receive appliances.", "I was just joking that this is like gift of the magi, except she sells her hair to buy him a new watch fob, and he buys a new watch fob. And then asks her why she's upset.", "The gift or the husband?", "She really waited a whole year for that moment. Amazing :D", "No, no we as guys do not do this\n\nInconsiderate people do this\n\nIt\u2019s not a gender thing, stop using our gender to excuse away the fact he tried to weasel extra Christmas presents out of this", "[He got you a Homer. ](https://youtu.be/NqrFpoxWqfU)", "I stuck to our budget and got hubby personalised golf tees and divit tool for Christmas he went over and brought me a Cricut (it was 2nd hand but still over budget). He got it for me cause 1 I had mentioned in 6 wanted one eventually, and 2, he could only gift it for Xmas cause it's the one time of year he can splurge on me without getting in to trouble with me. Usually, we just buy a couple of impulse items when we are out together and put them aside for Santa to give us.", "Include a divorce lawyer", "Have you seen the Simpsons episode where Homer gets Marge a bowling ball for her birthday? That says \"Homer\" on it.", "This is possibly one of the best episodes of the Simpsons.", "I\u2019m so proud for 12 yo you standing up for your mom!", "I meant both sets. Hubby gets no gift.", "Yes I see husband getting a nice bottle of Chanel No. 5 next year :P", "So does mine! He's NEVER brought me something I didn't want!", "The last Xmas I was with my exh, who didn't work, he bought me a video game that I hadn't played in years and had no interest in with my money.\n\nNow I buy myself what I want when I want it.", "It's a variation of weaponized incompetence. Get criticized for doing the shittiest job possible finding a gift for the person you are supposed to be closest to, refuse to ever do it again, profit in that you can blame the person you hurt the feelings of for your selfish, lazy, deliberately incompetent behavior.", "Right? He's treating her like one of the many internet strangers he cares nothing about.", "INFO:\n\n> I said a little dryly: \u201eHuh, so I got you something you wanted and you got you something you wanted. That is funny\u201c. He snapped and left the room. \n\nDid you do it in front of the kids?", "Nail clippers! But the small ones that bend easily.", "My partner buys me stuff for the house because it's what I want. I love a practical gift. Hoping for a food processor! Mine is struggling and the part I need isn't available anymore. It was one of my favorite gifts from my partner, too.\n\nBut the thing is, that means my partner would be a thoughtless asshole if he got me jewelry or something impractical after seeing me clearly work hard to pretend to like a necklace early on, just as many hetero men are assholes for buying appliances or home tools. It reeks of not even caring to know who your SO is or what they want, which is a much more fundamental issue than gifts. \n\nBuying yourself gifts in their name is the next level version, advanced mode of putting a ton of thought and effort into being thoughtless.", "I would suggest that he be responsible for returning the duplicate items and booking the therapy session as a compromise.", "But husband has the same set from OP, so using them would do nothing.", "Technically yes, but I said it in English. My kids only speak German and were very busy trying out their presents.", "Even better, she can make him watch while she flies solo. Then, once she's done, she can roll over and go to sleep and leave him hanging. I mean, since his gift to her was self-serving of him, it's only fair, right?"]}
